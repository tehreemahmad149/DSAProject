business with Beijing rather than Washington .\nThe most recent of these is the Southeast Asia nation of Cambodia .\nFor years Cambodia has incrementally pivoted from once serving US foreign policy objectives in the region , to striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to now doubling down on its ties with China in response to increasing levels of coercion not only from the US , but also from America \u2019 s European allies .\nIn early December 2021 the US announced an arms embargo on Cambodia , following sanctions against Cambodian leaders , for what the US claims is China \u2019 s \u201c deepening military influence \u201d in the country , CNBC reported .\nIn their article , \u201c US orders arms embargo on Cambodia , cites Chinese influence , \u201d CNBC would claim : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambodia , citing deepening Chinese military influence , corruption and human rights abuses by the government and armed forces in the Southeast Asian country .\nThe article would also note : A notice in the Federal Register said developments in Cambodia were \u201c contrary to US national security and foreign policy interests.\n\u201d Regarding previous US sanctions against Cambodian politicians , CNBC would report : The latest restrictions follow the Treasury Department \u2019 s ordering in November of sanctions against two senior Cambodian military officials for corruption and come amid increasing concern about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also point out that the US has imposed similar \u201c controls \u201d on other nations around the globe including Myanmar , China , Russia , and Venezuela .\nIndeed , the list of nations the US is attempting to isolate for either not subordinating themselves sufficiently to Washington \u2019 s \u201c national security and foreign policy interests \u201d or who have chosen to do business instead with Washington \u2019 s large and growing list of adversaries continues to expand \u2013 reflecting a global shift of power from West to East and exposing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other threats that are clearly proving unconvincing even for smaller nations like Cambodia .\nCambodia \u2019 s relationship with the United States for decades could easily be described as a \u201c hostage \u201d situation .\nIn addition to the constant threat of sanctions and embargoes , Cambodia also faced a US-sponsored political opposition Washington sought to eventually install into power .\nThe now banned Cambodia National Rescue Party ( CNRP ) is currently based in Washington DC with several of its senior leaders either openly residing in the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have admitted to receiving extensive US government backing in their bid to take power in Cambodia .\nIn a Phnom Penh Post article titled , \u201c Sokha video producer closes Phnom Penh office in fear , \u201d one of these senior CNRP leaders \u2013 Kem Sokha \u2013 would be quoted as saying : \u201c \u2026the USA that has assisted me , they asked me to take the model from Yugoslavia , Serbia , where they can change the dictator [ Slobodan ] Milosevic , \u201d he continues , referring to the former Serbian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protests following disputed elections , and died while on trial for war crimes .\nHe would also claim : \u201c I do not do anything at my own will .\nThere experts , professors at universities in Washington , DC , Montreal , Canada , hired by the Americans in order to advise me on the strategy to change the dictator leader in Cambodia.\n\u201d The US \u2013 as it does in nations around the globe it is targeting for political and economic coercion or even regime change \u2013 had also been funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interference within Cambodia .\nThis included US State Department-funded media platforms operating inside Cambodia ranging from Radio Free Asia and Voice of America , to fronts posing as rights groups including LICADHO and the Cambodian Center for Independent Media ( CCIM ) .\nThese US-sponsored organizations together with the CNRP sought to execute the \u201c Yugoslavia model , \u201d to overthrow the Cambodian government and install into power the CNRP .\nThe \u201c Yugoslavia model \u201d itself is , according to the New York Times , based on US interference in Serbia during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic .\nOpposition groups including Otpor were admittedly funded to the tune of several million dollars a year by the US government toward this end .\nWhat the US claims is Cambodia carrying out \u201c human rights abuses \u201d and being mired in \u201c corruption \u201d is simply Cambodia uprooting US interference within its internal political affairs and opting instead to do business with nations like China who respect Cambodia \u2019 s national sovereignty and are content with simply doing business .\nFree of US interference , Cambodia is able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what is in the best interests of itself and the region in which it resides .\nCNBC and other Western publications reporting on Cambodia decry the nation \u2019 s support for China over claims in the South China Sea vis-a-vis Washington \u2019 s attempts to undermine them .\nCambodia has also been accused by Washington of preparing to invite China \u2019 s navy in to use its ports .\nIt is interesting that the United States \u2013 a nation with a global military presence including several ongoing illegal military occupations \u2013 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon deal between Cambodia and China inside Cambodia \u2019 s sovereign territory .\nDecades ago the US was able to maintain its global primacy in a way that made it look effortless .\nToday , these efforts appear clumsy and even desperate \u2013 used with growing ineffectiveness against an ever increasing number of \u201c disobedient \u201d nations .\nCambodia , with a population of only 16.7 million people , counts the United States as its largest export market , with over 20 % of Cambodian exports headed to the US versus 6 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s exports go to either the US or Europe .\nAnd despite this \u2013 Cambodia has still found it either necessary or preferable to ignore US and European coercion and embrace China along with the rest of Asia .\nCambodia joins a growing list of nations doing so , aware of what the world will look like in not only the intermediate future \u2013 but also in the very near future .\nAnd while that future would appear bright for those subscribing to a multipolar world free of Western hegemony , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heavy price through sanctions , embargoes , and other forms of

official that Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed with Chinese President Xi Jinping the topic of a Russia-India-China summit meeting must have set alarm bells ringing in American circles .\nMeanwhile , there have been other signs too of an incipient rethink in Delhi on the wisdom of hitching the Indian wagons to the QUAD at a juncture when US politics is becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden Administration \u2019 s Indo-Pacific strategy is in serious doubt .\nBiden \u2019 s own political future is being discussed animatedly in the US .\nThe Indo-Pacific strategy is being reduced to the stuff of rhetoric by the state department .\nOf course , Secretary of State Blinken is good at hyperbolic rhetoric , but what \u2019 s there in it for India ?\nEven the fate of the QUAD \u2019 s vaccine manufacturing plans remains unclear until the true characteristics of Omicron , the new coronavirus variant ravaging the western world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the US is once again shacking up with the Pakistani generals and the Taliban over Afghanistan and Central Asia , what option does India have but to work on creating a peaceful external environment that enables it to sustain its

coal exports in January or until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of selling at least 25 % of their output to domestic buyers at US $ 70 per ton .\nIndonesian officials said the measure was aimed at helping local power plants secure enough coal to generate affordable electricity .\nThe Southeast Asian nation is China \u2019 s largest coal supplier .\nChina , which suffered a nationwide power crunch due to a surge in global coal prices last September , stabilized its coal supply by boosting coal production in Shanxi province and importing more from Russia over the past few months .\nDomestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month .\nHowever , Indonesia \u2019 s suspension of coal exports could create another coal shortage in China by March if no action is taken to alleviate the situation , according to a Golden Sun Securities research report .\nIn late September , three northeastern provinces \u2013 Liaoning , Jilin and Heilongjiang \u2013 that are home to nearly 100 million people announced power cut plans , which resulted in major disruptions to the daily lives of people and business operations .\nMany people were stuck in elevators , traffic lights were turned off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were also affected by the power crunch in some districts .\nPower plants in Guangdong province also announced new measures to limit electricity consumption .\nAfter the central government intervened and urged Shanxi province and Inner Mongolia to boost coal output , the power crunch eased in the fourth quarter .\nOn Tuesday , China \u2019 s National Bureau of Statistics ( NBS ) said prices of 34 coal products including mixed coal declined in late December from mid-December , while the prices of 12 other coal products including coking coal increased .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ China Center for International Economic Exchanges , a Beijing-based think tank , said coal prices were declining , showing that the undersupply situation had improved .\nLiu said Indonesia \u2019 s temporary coal export ban would bump up international coal prices in the short run but would not have a big impact on China , which could boost internal coal output to meet its demand .\nSu Jia , a researcher at Chem365.net , an industrial website , told Securities Daily that as China self-supplied most of its coal consumption , the impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on China would be manageable .\nSu also said electricity demand at Chinese factories would decline between mid-January and mid-February due to the Chinese New Year holiday , reducing the short-term impact of Indonesia \u2019 s ban .\nIn the first 11 months of 2021 , China \u2019 s coal production hit 3.67 billion tons while the country imported 290 million tons of coal , the NBS said on December 15 .\nDuring the same period , China imported 178 million tons of coal , mainly steam or thermal coal , from Indonesia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s total coal imports , according to the General Administration of Customs .\nSince November 6 , 2020 , China banned coal imports from Australia amid a downturn in relations that has spiraled into a bilateral trade war .\nAfter China was hit by a power crunch last September , it imported 2.79 million tons of Australian coal stored at China \u2019 s seaports pending customs clearance .\nOn Tuesday , an article titled \u201c Indonesia stabs a knife in China \u2019 s back by suddenly banning coal export \u201d was widely circulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership ( RCEP ) , a free-trade agreement signed by 15 Asia-Pacific nations including China and Indonesia , took effect on January 1 , 2022 , but Indonesia

\u2019 s coal export ban to end while importing more from Russia , Mongolia and other countries , or boost domestic production .\nOther commentators tried to explain the situation from a geopolitical

July 28 , 2021 , Okinawa Prefecture \u2019 s governor authorised coral transplantation at the construction site of the controversial Futenma Replacement Facility ( FRF ) in Henoko .\nTwo days later , he revoked this authorisation .\nThe coral have become a contested political issue , linked to the larger conflict between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the waters of \u014cura Bay and the history of the base issue , this article explores how Japanese authorities have ignored Okinawan protest , science , and the life of other species during the construction .\nThis political strategy of ignorance aims at frustrating opposition and framing the FRF as inevitable .\n\u201c As humans reshape the landscape , we forget what was there before \u2026 Our newly shaped and ruined landscapes become the new reality ( Gan et al .\n2017 : G6 ) .\n\u201d It is hard to describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coral of \u014cura Bay .\nLooking down from the railing of a boat , they are covered by a turquoise veil of shimmering waves , blurring the different species into one .\nIt is beautiful , but it makes it difficult to envision what it really looks like down there .\nTo get a real understanding you need to jump into those turquoise waters .\nSo let \u2019 s jump in and dive down !\nCoral of \u014cura Bay close to the construction site .\nSeen from above , their diversity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBeneath the surface , a new colour spectrum discloses itself in front of your eyes .\nDifferent shades of blue remain the dominant colour , but the coral also form a mix of greens , yellows and even reds stretching their arms in all directions or forming cloud-like structures , some larger than a small car .\nOthers form round tables , big enough for sea turtles to take refuge beneath .\nDifferent species of Achropora , Poritidae and Montipora form the dominant coral in this part of \u014cura Bay , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as blue coral ( Heliopora coerulea ) grow as well .\nFish in shimmering silver , orange and purple chase each other , others barely move , hiding in this forest of colours .\nBlue parrotfish are crunching on the coral beneath you .\nA black and white striped sea snake winds itself to the surface and goes down again , disappearing in one of the many cracks and holes .\nWhere coral thrive , other species do too .\nJumping into \u014cura Bay is like jumping onto a painter \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are filled with life .\nIt is not just the richness of coral that makes \u014cura Bay ecologically significant .\nIt also brings together many other environmental features , such as mangrove forests , tidal flats , sandy beaches , and waters up to thirty meters deep .\nWith over 5,300 different species , including 263 endangered ones , the Bay is a hotspot of

Office ) .\nSome of these species have only been confirmed in the bay , such as small crabs ( Paralbunea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ( Daibingu ch\u012bmu snakku snafukin 2015 : 113 ) .\nAlso , the critically endangered Okinawan dugong , a charismatic marine mammal , used to visit the bay in the past although recently there have been no confirmed sightings .\nLively coral in the northern part of \u014cura Bay , \u00a9 Palz 2021 .\nDiving down makes one realise the richness of Okinawan waters .\nI had come to Okinawa as an anthropologist researching the changing relationship between the Okinawan dugong and the human inhabitants of the Ry\u016bky\u016b Islands .\nLiving in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the waters of the bay , but I also interviewed many of its ( human ) inhabitants and scholars regarding questions of environmental change .\nIn the last decade , the largest of these changes has been the construction of a new military base known as the Futenma Replacement Facility ( FRF ) in the waters of Henoko Village .\nThe new base is supposed to replace the dangerous Marine Corps Air Station Futenma , situated in the densely populated city of Ginowan , where noisy helicopters and accident prone MV-22 Osprey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elementary schools on a daily basis , often ignoring night flight curfews or even causing accidents.1 The Government of Japan insists that adjoining the FRF to existing Camp Schwab in Henoko is the only solution for closing the base in Futenma .\nHowever , for many Okinawans \u2014 including the current Prefectural Government \u2014 the construction of the FRF at Henoko is intolerable , not just because it destroys the precious and unique marine life of \u014cura Bay but also because the new base would imprint the American military presence onto Okinawa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base in Henoko would also mean that large military vessels could enter the deep waters of the bay .\nThis would be an upgrade to the current air station in Futenma , which is lacking access to the sea .\nTo make all this happen the waters around Henoko have to be land filled .\nWaters similar to those we explored in the opening section .\nEnclosed by a floating line of orange buoys , the construction site itself is off limits .\nNobody except personnel authorized by the Okinawan Defense Bureau ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landfill is being planned .\nAlthough much soil has been dumped into the ocean already , there is still a lot of work to be done .\nAccording to the Okinawa Times , only around 5 % of landfill work has been completed by April 2021 ( Okinawa taimusu 2021 ) .\nOn the northern side of the construction site , where the sea floor has been found to be as soft as \u201c mayonnaise \u201d ( see Lummis 2018 ) , it remains to be seen whether the project is even possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be lengthy , costly and destructive .\nHere , where construction has not yet commenced , that colourful coral is still alive .\nAlthough my academic focus is not coral per se , as a fundamental part of the ecosystem of \u014cura Bay , coral was ever-present during my research .\nIn 1962 and 1969 the coral reef of \u014cura Bay was blasted , to enable military drills ( Ry\u016bky\u016b Asahi Broadcasting & Norimatsu 2010 : 4 ) .\nAt that time , the U.S. military already was planning to build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the tip of Cape Henoko .\nHowever , the war in Vietnam consumed too much of the defence budget .\nThe project was thus shelved , but it was not forgotten ( McCormack & Norimatsu 2012 : 93 ) .\nToday , soil for landfill is brought through this opened up reef by ship all the way from the Motobu Peninsula on the other side of Okinawa Main Island .\nOlder generations in particular also reported how in other parts of the island coral reefs and their inner shallow waters ( referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Uchin\u0101guchi ) were filled in to create infrastructure and housing projects , or to construct seawalls .\nAs a result , according to Giovanni Diego Masucci and James D. Reimer , both marine researchers at the University of the Ry\u016bky\u016bs , already 63 % of Okinawa \u2019 s coastline has been altered by humans , cutting the remaining 37 % into fragments ( 2019 : 8 ) .\nNot all of these developments have destroyed coral , but many have .\nThe Henoko project will continue the pattern .\nMuch has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military presence in Okinawa and the new base in Henoko ( see for example Tanji 2006 ; McCormack & Norimatsu 2012 ; Inoue 2017 ) and some of it will be mentioned on the following pages .\nHowever , in this article I would like to explore how the Government of Japan reshapes imagined possible futures of \u014cura Bay \u2019 s residents through what I call a political strategy of ignorance .\nThinking with the coral of \u014cura Bay in this context not only helps to understand how the central government employs ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also how the construction of official knowledge by the state is used to justify questionable environmental harm mitigation methods .\nLively coral in the northern part of \u014cura Bay , \u00a9 Palz 2021 .\nTo mitigate the adverse effects of the landfill project in \u014cura Bay the Japanese government proposes to move roughly 40,000 coral colonies , replanting them in areas outside of the construction site .\nWhen transplanting coral , smaller fragments are taken from the colony and moved to a different place , where they are attached to rocks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conditions are right , the relocated coral can thrive again .\nMany privately and publicly funded coral restoration programs in the Okinawan islands and beyond do exist ( see Claus 2020 : 183 ) .\nThe current Okinawan Prefectural Government , which opposes the base construction , withheld its authorisation for replanting the coral colonies until it was forced through by the Japanese Supreme Court in July , 2021 in compliance with orders from the Ministry of Agriculture , Forestry and Fisheries .\nThe Supreme Court \u2019 s decision was based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abusing his power if he does not give his authorisation .\nIt is important to mention , however , that the court \u2019 s decision was a close one as two of five justices sided with Tamaki ( Abe 2021 ) in the protracted legal confrontation between Okinawa Prefecture and the central government .\nThe Okinawa Prefectural Government was left with little choice but to comply , asserting certain conditions , such as the promise to avoid moving the coral during the hot summer months .\nHot water temperatures during summer make coral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in coral science ( Okubo et al .\n2005 : 340 ) .\nCoral get their colour from microscopic algae with which they live in symbiosis .\nIf water temperatures get too high or other stress factors occur , coral expel the algae and turn white .\nIn case of hot water temperatures over a long period of time , the coral eventually die .\nAnother factor that has to be taken into account is that coral reproduction is much higher for coral transplanted in February then for those transplanted in July ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nAlso , a manual published by Okinawa Prefecture as early as 2008 explicitly states that the summer month are not suitable for coral transplantation not only because of high water temperatures , but also because typhoons during this time of year are likely to damage the fragile replanted coral ( Okinawaken bunka kanky\u014dbu shizen hogoka 2008 : 12 ) .\nExamples of these effects already exist in Okinawa .\nDuring maintenance work on the Taketomi southern sea route ( taketomi minami k\u014dro ) coral were transplanted in August and September 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these months over 30 % of the transplanted coral colonies died of bleaching , while only 4 % of untouched coral were affected ( Tamaki et al .\n2021 : 4 ) .\nIn spite of the Prefectural Government \u2019 s asserted conditions , after gaining authorisation from the governor on July 28 , the ODB immediately started the replanting process on July 29 , whereupon Tamaki immediately revoked his authorisation the following day .\nIgnoring the will of the Okinawan Prefectural Government as well as the tenets of basic science accurately reflects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a majority of Okinawa \u2019 s citizens and is consistent with the flawed Environmental Impact Assessment ( EIA ) conducted in preparation of the base construction .\nAt the construction site in \u014cura Bay , \u00a9 Palz 2021 .\nEvery weekday ships and trucks bring soil for landfill .\nIn his work on forest fires and the state in Mexico , anthropologist Andrew S. Mathews explains that \u201c state power may depend upon a management of ignorance and of knowledge by officials and their clients ( Matthews 2005 : 796 ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of ignorance by mid-level and field-level forest service officials in dealing with forest fires to be able to navigate conservationist state policies and strengthen local networks among communities that conduct swidden agriculture .\nBy concealing local forest fires used in a controlled way from their superiors and the state , these officials manage to balance state policies and realities on the ground .\nIt is important to notice , however , that this navigation is only necessary because the federal government condemns the use of fire by rural groups in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage from forest fires , the government and high-ranking forest service officials ignore the interest of local farmers and cater to urban Mexicans who make up the most influential political constituency .\nIn so doing they exercise power by ignoring alternative worldviews , such as traditional and controlled use of fire in swidden agriculture .\nSeveral levels of officials on local and state level have employed similar strategies of ignorance towards alternating worldviews in the Henoko context to frustrate the coral preservationist and anti-base sentiments of local inhabitants .\nIn 1997 , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberal Democratic Party , LDP ) originally opposed the base construction in Henoko .\nHowever , after pressure was applied by the central government ( Hashimoto cabinet ) to accept the base he ignored the outcome of a municipal referendum opposing it by 52 % , making way for the construction .\nIn 2019 , the central government again ignored a prefectural referendum in which 72 % of participating Okinawan citizens opposed the construction .\nNow , in its attempts to replant coral amidst high water temperatures of the summer months and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated basic science.As an outsider looking at these practices of ignoring , I am not surprised that some of the inhabitants of \u014cura Bay who are not active in the anti-base movement but opposed construction in the referendums , convey a deep feeling of powerlessness against a decision that was made over their heads between the governments of Japan and the United States .\nSome have even started to question Japan \u2019 s constitutional democracy .\nTalking to one of my interviewees ( a regular citizen of the \u014cura Bay region who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the potential threat of Chinese aggression2and therefore on the legitimation of U.S. bases in Okinawa , he concluded that the Chinese and Japanese governments are not so different from each other .\nReflecting on the Henoko construction , he said : \u201c The government is ignoring the voice of the local people , so in this there is no difference from China ( ch\u016bgoku to kawaranai ) .\n\u201d It has long been Japanese government strategy to confront Okinawa prefecture and local residents of \u014cura Bay with a rhetoric of inevitability : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so live with it .\nThis is the message that has been arriving in the villages of \u014cura Bay for several decades .\nIt seems to some people who oppose the base but do not protest openly , that all they can do is to make the best out of it by adapting to this \u201c inevitable situation \u201d .\nIt is not only that opposing voices of the Okinawan people have been ignored , the production of official knowledge by the state has also played an important role in presenting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published in 2011 concluded that the construction would have no adverse effects on the endangered Okinawa dugong , a species that was confirmed to visit the bay proper and surrounding waters frequently to graze on the sea grass growing close to its shores ( see also Yoshikawa 2020 ) .\nDespite this conclusion , no dugongs were spotted in the bay since construction began in 2017 .\nAccording to surveys conducted by the ODB , no feeding trails , which are indirect signs of dugong presence , were found around the construction site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In spring 2020 , sounds that were potential dugong calls were recorded by the ODB ( Okinawa b\u014deikyoku 2020b : 12 ) , but the Ministry of Defense refuses to release the data or to get a second opinion on the matter from neutral researchers .\nAs an observer , this leaves me with two possible conclusions : Either the sound sensitive dugongs refrain from entering the bay where heavy construction work is progressing and sound waves of ship engines prevent their peaceful grazing , or dugongs were able to visit the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ignoring their presence as a release of data could cause construction to stop .\nIt seems clear that the EIA was conducted to enable the base construction in the first place , rather than to protect the environment .\nA similar question arises when looking at the Environmental Monitoring Committee , purportedly an independent scientific entity created by the ODB to monitor and advise on the impact of base construction on the environment .\nConsidering the scientifically unjustifiable timing of coral transplantation , it seems clear that the committee is facilitating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advising against coral transplantation in summer in the face of scientific evidence .\nFurthermore , some members of the committee submitted a scientific article to the platform Research Square declaring the critically endangered dugong to be extinct around Okinawa ( Kayanne et al .\n2021 ) .\nAlthough the article has not yet undergone peer review and is therefore categorized as a preliminary report , declaring the dugong extinct could have political consequences for environmental mitigation measures at the base construction site .\nThe article \u2019 s conclusion is therefore highly political and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors wrote the article as independent researchers and not as committee members , questions arise of official knowledge production .\nProtesters at the gate of Camp Schwab , Henoko , \u00a9 Palz 2021 .\nLike the EIA , the replanting of coral seems to be a cosmetic , rather than a mitigative intervention .\nIf the ODB were really concerned about coral survival , it would not have replanted in the hot summer months immediately after gaining authorisation from governor Tamaki .\nFurthermore , a final decision on whether successful construction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untouched areas of \u014cura Bay has still yet to be made .\nIf construction is not possible , coral transplantation itself will become meaningless .\nBringing all these threats together , it becomes clear that the Japanese government is practicing a political strategy of ignorance with grave consequences .\nIgnoring its own citizens ( a majority of the inhabitants of \u014cura Bay and Okinawa Prefecture ) , ignoring natural obstacles ( the \u201c mayonnaise \u201d sea floor ) , ignoring the habitat of fellow inhabitants of \u014cura Bay ( such as the dugong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic scientific advice on coral transplantation and requests by the Okinawa Prefectural Government .\nI would like to connect this thought on a political strategy of ignorance with the quote that began this article : \u201c As humans reshape the landscape , we forget what was there before \u2026 Our newly shaped and ruined landscapes become the new reality ( Gan et al .\n2017 : G6 ) .\n\u201d For residents of \u014cura Bay this connection is relevant in two ways .\nFirstly , with its political strategy of ignorance the Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay in very physical ways ( filling up water with land and transplanting coral for example ) .\nBy doing that it is creating a new reality for future generations , a reality in which a sea filled with concrete and the sound of V-22 Osprey are normalized .\nSecondly , the political strategy of ignorance is reshaping mental landscapes of local citizens into one in which the new base is inevitable .\nIn other words , imagined possible future landscapes are reduced to one option : a bay with a base and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This does not mean that the knowledge constructed by the state and its political strategy of ignorance are unchallenged .\nThe protest movement against the base is continuing both on a very local level in front of the gates of Camp Schwab and the waters of \u014cura Bay , and at the level of official politics as shown by governor Tamaki \u2019 s opposition to coral transplantation .\nHowever , it is worth looking at how the central government \u2019 s strategies of normalizing the base construction by exercising both ignorance and power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how they impinge on those who are most affected by the construction : human and non-human inhabitants of \u014cura Bay .\nIt has yet to be seen how the revocation of Governor Tamaki \u2019 s authorisation will play out , but at the time of writing , transplantation of coral is continuing without his permission .\nAfter the revocation of approval , the ODB filed a complaint to the Ministry of the Agriculture , Forestry and Fisheries , which decided to continue the transplantation .\nIf the issue ends up in court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Japanese government rather than Okinawa , as they have done so many times in the past .\nIf this comes to pass , the political strategy of ignorance will have proven , once again , to result in further damage to physical and imagined landscapes .\nI would like to thank the inhabitants of \u014cura Bay

tennis World Number One , has always had a tendency to get under skin and constitution , creating a large following of admirers and detractors .\nBut his current treatment by Australian authorities , and his subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted a visa to participate in the Australian Open , had the hallmarks of oppression and incompetent vulgarity .\nIn time , it may well also prove to have been another example of provincial opportunism and crass stupidity .\nIt all began with the thick cloud of doubt over whether the Serbian tennis star needed to show proof of vaccination or otherwise in entering Australia .\nThe Australian Open had become the first grand slam tennis tournament to require mandatory vaccination for all athletes subject to exemptions .\nThis was a position also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained unclear was whether dispensations could be granted , and under what conditions .\nDjokovic was always unwilling to reveal his vaccination status .\nHis response to the pandemic has also been patchy , even cavalier .\nThe Adria Tour in June 2020 , created as a response to the cancellation of various sporting events , proved disastrous .\nOrganised by the Novak Djokovic Foundation as a \u201c charity tour to help the coronavirus victims \u201d , it saw players , spectators and officials contract COVID-19 , including Djokovic himself , resulting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other tennis players , his application to participate in the Australian tournament , assessed anonymously , was accepted , leading him to confirm his departure for Melbourne earlier this month .\nTwo bodies were involved in conducting the review : Tennis Australia and an independent medical exemption review panel .\nThe Victorian Department of Health confirmed that the exemptions had been granted to those with a \u201c genuine medical condition \u201d .\nThe next part of the story is revealing about Australian officialdom .\nOn arriving in Melbourne , Djokovic encountered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force famous in celluloid , social media and print .\nIt was all good to have received an exemption from two bodies ; but the ABF retained the discretion to ask for further particulars and revoke any visa at their discretion .\nThe Commonwealth , after all , is the final arbiter as to who crosses the border .\nA statement by the ABF , never paragons of thoroughness or justice , claimed that \u201c Mr Djokovic failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements to Australia , and his visa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cobwebbed mind of bureaucratic reasoning , this could mean , and be , anything .\nIn the right royal mess that ensued , the Victorian government , on being asked by the federal government to supply evidence of Djokovic \u2019 s exemption , declined to sponsor him .\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison , showing that exemptions are viewed differently depending on which authority in Australia provides them , was satisfied that the right decision had been made .\nIn his particular reasoning , \u201c Rules are rules , especially when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these rules .\nOur strong border policies have been critical to Australia having one of the lowest death rates in the world from COVID , we are continuing to be vigilant.\n\u201d Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews also stated that all arrivals in Australia had to \u201c provide acceptable proof that they can not be vaccinated for medical reasons \u201d .\nAbsent that , Djokovic \u201c won \u2019 t be treated any different to anyone else and he \u2019 ll be on the next plane home.\n\u201d Such words are rich coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of law , convention and due process .\nThe view also went some way in making a mockery of the assessments by both Tennis Australia and the medical review board .\nAs Australia Open director Paul McNamee explained to the ABC , \u201c every player and support member fills in a form , visa 408 , and everyone does that , you are guided through it by Tennis Australia , every step of the way , and then you get approval , that is the process.\n\u201d \u201c was following the rules .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ given an exemption , but players need to have confidence that the rules they abide by are going to be enforced , so if this is something to [ do ] with the vaccination in the exemption , for me that \u2019 s not fair.\n\u201d The legal challenge by Djokovic makes various assertions .\nThe player received , the defence argues , a temporary activity class visa on November 18 .\nDjokovic had tested positive to a PCR test on December 16 and was subsequently granted the exemption .\nIt was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent a note on January 1 informing him that he had met \u201c the requirements for a quarantine-free arrival into Australia \u201d .\nThe submission is in stark contrast to correspondence from the Health Department and the Commonwealth .\nThe former \u2019 s First Assistant Secretary Lisa Schofield had informed Tennis Australia Chief Executive Craig Tilley that , \u201c People who have previously had COVID-19 and not received a vaccine does are not considered fully vaccinated.\n\u201d Health Minister Greg Hunt , on following up Schofield \u2019 s observations , also confirmed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months and seek to enter Australia from overseas , and have not received two doses of a Therapeutic Goods Administration ( TGA ) -approved or TGA-recognised vaccine \u2026 are not considered fully vaccinated.\n\u201d Most tellingly , the Morrison government , and a good number of Fortress Australia types , have made it clear that the very concept of any right of entry , notably during times of emergency such as a pandemic , is irrelevant and has no bearing in a court of law or before any tribunal of justice .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Novak , he should not be surprised that Australian government officials are equally contemptuous of any right of return for Australian citizens , who remain at the mercy of a spray of weak High Court judgments and a total absence of constitutional protection .\nTens of thousands have been stranded in other countries since 2020 , left at the mercy of menacing poverty , lack of safety , reviled and mocked as disease ridden and undeserving of sanctuary .\nThe Commonwealth and State governments have all done their bit to prevent such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in some cases , threatening punitive fines .\nThe Australian passport has become a form of debased coinage .\nThe cancellation of Djovokic \u2019 s visa also led to another brush with institutional savagery .\nThe tennis player is being detained at Carlton \u2019 s Park Hotel , a facility that has been used for refugees more than acquainted with the concentration camp system reserved for \u201c unlawful \u201d naval arrivals .\nHe can at least count himself fortunate not to be rendered to the tropical torture centres of Nauru or Manus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s undesirables .\nWhen it comes to Australia \u2019 s refugee concentration camp system , celebrity or standing provides little by way of salvation .\nAs former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull explained to his counterpart President Donald Trump in discussing a refugee transfer between the countries , Australia would be more than happy to jail Nobel Prize laureates if they did not have the requisite paperwork .\n\u201c So , we would rather take a not-very-attractive guy that helps you out than to take a Nobel Peace Prize winner that comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having been in captivity for almost a decade , have also noted the sudden spike of interest , if only because of the celebrity calibre attention being paid to Djokovic .\nProtests in Serbia , Montenegro and Australia have taken place .\nCarlton \u2019 s Park Hotel has been the site of a hearty gathering of supporters .\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 has urged that the tennis player not be held \u201c in that infamous hotel \u201d .\nThis could but induce sadness on the part of Mehdi Ali , an Iranian immigrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Australia and is also being held at the Park Hotel .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been in a cage for 9 years , I turn 24 today , and all you want to talk to me about is [ Djokovic ] , \u201d he tweeted on January 7 .\n\u201c Pretending to care by asking me how I am and then straight away asking questions about Djokovic.\n\u201d To the hosts of an Australian television program The Project , Mehdi did take some heart that attention was finally being showered upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those who \u201c came here for Djokovic \u2026 found out about our circumstances and they were shocked.\n\u201d The appeal hearing against the decision by the ABF is taking place today ( January 10 ) where some sense of the brutish nonsense that has transpired may be made .\nBut for the likes

have caused such consternation .\nNovak Djokovic , the tennis World Number One , has always had a tendency to get under skin and constitution , creating a large following of admirers and detractors .\nBut his current treatment by Australian authorities , and his subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted a visa to participate in the Australian Open , had the hallmarks of oppression and incompetent vulgarity .\nIn time , it may well also prove to have been another example of provincial opportunism and crass stupidity .\nIt all began with the thick cloud of doubt over whether the Serbian tennis star needed to show proof of vaccination or otherwise in entering Australia .\nThe Australian Open had become the first grand slam tennis tournament to require mandatory vaccination for all athletes subject to exemptions .\nThis was a position also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained unclear was whether dispensations could be granted , and under what conditions .\nDjokovic was always unwilling to reveal his vaccination status .\nHis response to the pandemic has also been patchy , even cavalier .\nThe Adria Tour in June 2020 , created as a response to the cancellation of various sporting events , proved disastrous .\nOrganised by the Novak Djokovic Foundation as a \u201c charity tour to help the coronavirus victims \u201d , it saw players , spectators and officials contract COVID-19 , including Djokovic himself , resulting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other tennis players , his application to participate in the Australian tournament , assessed anonymously , was accepted , leading him to confirm his departure for Melbourne earlier this month .\nTwo bodies were involved in conducting the review : Tennis Australia and an independent medical exemption review panel .\nThe Victorian Department of Health confirmed that the exemptions had been granted to those with a \u201c genuine medical condition \u201d .\nThe next part of the story is revealing about Australian officialdom .\nOn arriving in Melbourne , Djokovic encountered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force famous in celluloid , social media and print .\nIt was all good to have received an exemption from two bodies ; but the ABF retained the discretion to ask for further particulars and revoke any visa at their discretion .\nThe Commonwealth , after all , is the final arbiter as to who crosses the border .\nA statement by the ABF , never paragons of thoroughness or justice , claimed that \u201c Mr Djokovic failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements to Australia , and his visa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cobwebbed mind of bureaucratic reasoning , this could mean , and be , anything .\nIn the right royal mess that ensued , the Victorian government , on being asked by the federal government to supply evidence of Djokovic \u2019 s exemption , declined to sponsor him .\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison , showing that exemptions are viewed differently depending on which authority in Australia provides them , was satisfied that the right decision had been made .\nIn his particular reasoning , \u201c Rules are rules , especially when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these rules .\nOur strong border policies have been critical to Australia having one of the lowest death rates in the world from COVID , we are continuing to be vigilant.\n\u201d Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews also stated that all arrivals in Australia had to \u201c provide acceptable proof that they can not be vaccinated for medical reasons \u201d .\nAbsent that , Djokovic \u201c won \u2019 t be treated any different to anyone else and he \u2019 ll be on the next plane home.\n\u201d Such words are rich coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of law , convention and due process .\nThe view also went some way in making a mockery of the assessments by both Tennis Australia and the medical review board .\nAs Australia Open director Paul McNamee explained to the ABC , \u201c every player and support member fills in a form , visa 408 , and everyone does that , you are guided through it by Tennis Australia , every step of the way , and then you get approval , that is the process.\n\u201d \u201c was following the rules .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ given an exemption , but players need to have confidence that the rules they abide by are going to be enforced , so if this is something to [ do ] with the vaccination in the exemption , for me that \u2019 s not fair.\n\u201d The legal challenge by Djokovic makes various assertions .\nThe player received , the defence argues , a temporary activity class visa on November 18 .\nDjokovic had tested positive to a PCR test on December 16 and was subsequently granted the exemption .\nIt was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent a note on January 1 informing him that he had met \u201c the requirements for a quarantine-free arrival into Australia \u201d .\nThe submission is in stark contrast to correspondence from the Health Department and the Commonwealth .\nThe former \u2019 s First Assistant Secretary Lisa Schofield had informed Tennis Australia Chief Executive Craig Tilley that , \u201c People who have previously had COVID-19 and not received a vaccine does are not considered fully vaccinated.\n\u201d Health Minister Greg Hunt , on following up Schofield \u2019 s observations , also confirmed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months and seek to enter Australia from overseas , and have not received two doses of a Therapeutic Goods Administration ( TGA ) -approved or TGA-recognised vaccine \u2026 are not considered fully vaccinated.\n\u201d Most tellingly , the Morrison government , and a good number of Fortress Australia types , have made it clear that the very concept of any right of entry , notably during times of emergency such as a pandemic , is irrelevant and has no bearing in a court of law or before any tribunal of justice .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Novak , he should not be surprised that Australian government officials are equally contemptuous of any right of return for Australian citizens , who remain at the mercy of a spray of weak High Court judgments and a total absence of constitutional protection .\nTens of thousands have been stranded in other countries since 2020 , left at the mercy of menacing poverty , lack of safety , reviled and mocked as disease ridden and undeserving of sanctuary .\nThe Commonwealth and State governments have all done their bit to prevent such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in some cases , threatening punitive fines .\nThe Australian passport has become a form of debased coinage .\nThe cancellation of Djovokic \u2019 s visa also led to another brush with institutional savagery .\nThe tennis player is being detained at Carlton \u2019 s Park Hotel , a facility that has been used for refugees more than acquainted with the concentration camp system reserved for \u201c unlawful \u201d naval arrivals .\nHe can at least count himself fortunate not to be rendered to the tropical torture centres of Nauru or Manus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s undesirables .\nWhen it comes to Australia \u2019 s refugee concentration camp system , celebrity or standing provides little by way of salvation .\nAs former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull explained to his counterpart President Donald Trump in discussing a refugee transfer between the countries , Australia would be more than happy to jail Nobel Prize laureates if they did not have the requisite paperwork .\n\u201c So , we would rather take a not-very-attractive guy that helps you out than to take a Nobel Peace Prize winner that comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having been in captivity for almost a decade , have also noted the sudden spike of interest , if only because of the celebrity calibre attention being paid to Djokovic .\nProtests in Serbia , Montenegro and Australia have taken place .\nCarlton \u2019 s Park Hotel has been the site of a hearty gathering of supporters .\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 has urged that the tennis player not be held \u201c in that infamous hotel \u201d .\nThis could but induce sadness on the part of Mehdi Ali , an Iranian immigrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Australia and is also being held at the Park Hotel .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been in a cage for 9 years , I turn 24 today , and all you want to talk to me about is [ Djokovic ] , \u201d he tweeted on January 7 .\n\u201c Pretending to care by asking me how I am and then straight away asking questions about Djokovic.\n\u201d To the hosts of an Australian television program The Project , Mehdi did take some heart that attention was finally being showered upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those who \u201c came here for Djokovic \u2026 found out about our circumstances and they were shocked.\n\u201d The appeal hearing against the decision by the ABF is taking place today ( January 10 ) where some sense of the brutish nonsense that has transpired may be made .\nBut for the likes of Mehdi , the Djokovic storm , whether it results in him playing or not in Melbourne , will pass .\nA country filled with the descendants of convicts and their gaolers will continue working to form .\nNote to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above or below .\nFollow us on Instagram , @ crg_globalresearch .\nForward this article to your email

ADF \u2019 s Combined Arms Fighting System , which includes infantry , artillery , communications , engineers , attack helicopters and logistics.\n\u201d Tanks were versatile creatures , able to be \u201c used in a wide range of scenarios , environments and levels of conflict in the region.\n\u201d To dispel any notion that this purchase simply confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , the defence minister also claimed that the new Abrams \u201c will incorporate the latest development in Australian sovereign capabilities , including command , control , communications , computers and intelligence systems , and benefit from the intended manufacture of tank ammunition in Australia.\n\u201d In other words , once Australia finishes with these cherished , dear imports , adjusted as they are bound to be for the ADF , they are more likely to be extortionately priced museum pieces rather than operable weapons of flexible deployment .\nThis latest tank infatuation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ADF and the Australian public service can never be accused of being historically informed , at least in any meaningfully accurate way .\nThe same goes for the current defence minister , hardly a bookworm of the history muse Cleo .\nThe last time Australia deployed tanks in combat was during the Vietnam War , that other grand failure of military adventurism .\nThey were never used in Australia \u2019 s engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan , despite being lauded as being a necessary vehicle in beating down insurgency movements .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a range of scenarios that make little mention of tanks .\nIt labours over the US-China relationship , \u201c the enduring threat of terrorism \u201d emanating from \u201c ungoverned parts of Africa , the Middle East and Asia \u201d , notes the threats posed by \u201c state fragility \u201d and the \u201c emergence of new complex , non-geographic threats , including cyber threats to the security of information and communications systems.\n\u201d At best , it throws away a line without elaboration : that the ADF will need \u201c tank upgrades and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the purchase have included otherwise hawkish pundits such as Greg Sheridan of The Australian , who spent some of last year shaking his head at the proposed acquisition after it was announced by the US Defence Cooperation Agency .\nThe decision , he opined unleashing his talons , was one of \u201c sheer idiocy \u201d , an \u201c anachronistic frivolity \u201d .\nTanks and other heavy , tracked vehicles would \u201c never be of the slightest military use to us.\n\u201d Sheridan poses a range of questions .\nIn any confrontation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the South China Sea ?\nOr \u201c take out enemy submarines ?\n\u201d Or \u201c deliver attack missiles over hundreds of kilometres ?\n\u201d His solutions : buy more jets , manufacture more drones , and address naval capabilities .\nOthers also argue that Dutton , were he to be genuinely interested in Australia \u2019 s security and safety , would be spending more time on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and coping with the threats posed by climate change , or investing in pandemic responses .\nNow that would be a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering of near cultic loyalty , are swooning in triumph .\nAs Peter J .\nDean , director of the Defence and Security Institute at the University of Western

Korean Institute of Nuclear Safety in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by KTX bullet train , lies a superconducting fusion power plant \u2013 or , if you prefer , \u201c artificial sun.\n\u201d It is this facility that set a record that generated excited headlines across global scientific media at the end of last year .\nOn November 24 , the KSTAR project of the Korea Institute of Fusion Energy ( KFE ) announced it had continuously operated plasma for 30 seconds with an ion temperature higher than 100 million degrees Celsius \u2013 more than double its previous time record .\nTo the uninitiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiated , it is an encouraging milestone on the path to workable nuclear fusion \u2013 the power source that ignites the sun and the stars .\n\u201c We successfully sustained [ fusion ] for 30 seconds last year , \u201d Yoo Suk-jae , the president of the KFE , told reporters visiting the KSTAR facility this week .\n\u201c We usually say that fusion energy is a dream energy source \u2013 it is almost limitless , with low emission of greenhouse gases and no high-level radioactive waste \u2013 [ but ] this means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a world racked by distrust , hatred and conflict , KSTAR is part of a different dream .\nIt is a key player in one of mankind \u2019 s most ambitious scientific programs , albeit one that is little known outside its own sector : ITER .\nThe International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor , which is rising in southern France , could feasibly overcome what many see as humanity \u2019 s greatest challenge \u2013 the energy and climate change crisis .\nRemarkably \u2013 unlike other paradigm-smashing scientific mega-programs , such as the Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is truly international in scope , crossing the world \u2019 s most hostile ideological and political frontiers .\nITER \u2019 s 35 member states include China , the EU ( including the UK ) , India , Japan , Russia , South Korea and the United States .\nA model of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor under construction in the south of France , with an expected completion date of 2027 .\nPhoto : WikiCommons The KFE was founded in 1995 , employs 437 staff and has an annual budget of US $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the KSTAR , or Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research , in Daejon .\nDespite its acronym , the KSTAR facility has nothing to do with K-pop , but everything to do with nuclear fusion .\nMost energy sources consume a non-renewable resource : Biological sources such as wood or biomass , or fossil fuels such as coal , oil and gas .\nRenewable energies , such as solar , wind and hydro are clean and unlimited , but , lacking consistent generation , are unable to sustain the level of operations required for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process used in atomic power plants , creates dangerous waste .\nNuclear fusion suffers none of these drawbacks .\nIn the heart of a star , hydrogen nuclei collide , fuse into heavier helium atoms and release tremendous amounts of energy .\nA star generates this fusion organically through its extreme gravitational densities and temperatures .\nOn Earth , the most promising \u201c fuel \u201d for nuclear fusion to occur has been found to be two hydrogen isotopes \u2013 deuterium and lithium .\nThese can be sourced from the oceans \u2019 virtually unlimited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuels may be easy to source , their fusion is a fiendishly complex process .\nIt requires huge , specialized devices that fuse the lithium and deuterium , turning them into a hydrogen state , where electrons separate from ions and gas becomes plasma .\nStars are aided by densities that the Earth \u2019 s atmosphere does not possess .\nSo , for fusion to occur here , temperatures must be raised and maintained at extraordinary heat .\nIt is this maintenance , or \u201c confinement , \u201d of super-heated plasma that KSTAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fusion reaction \u2013 is a mansion-sized device that would make a perfect set location for a science-fiction film .\nThe tokamak uses powerful magnetic fields to confine the plasma in a donut-shaped vacuum ring .\nThe plasma within reaches such ludicrous heat that thermal devices can not measure it : Instead , scientists analyze its temperature by dissecting its light waves .\n\u201c We can generate tritium on-site from seawater , \u201d KSTAR Director Yoon Si-woo told reporters as he showed them around the machinery .\n\u201c We have to heat up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this [ fusion ] concept will not happen.\n\u201d November \u2019 s 30-second operation at 100-million degrees \u2013 a huge advance over KSTAR \u2019 s first experiment in 2008 , which lasted only one second \u2013 was a critical milestone , Yoon said .\nBut that length of time needs to be far exceeded for fusion to become viable as a power source .\n\u201c This is not the end of the story , we must move on to 300 seconds \u2013 300 is the minimum time frame to demonstrate steady-state operations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we can \u2019 t achieve that \u2013 we have to do something else , \u201d he said .\nThings will be heating up at KSTAR in the next coming years .\nKSTAR \u2019 s deadline to hit the 300-second mark is 2026 .\nMultiple hurdles lie ahead .\n\u201c To increase the fusion rate , you have to increase the temperature and the density , \u201d Yoon said .\n\u201c Now we are focused on temperature , but we must also focus on density.\n\u201d Another issue is cooling , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with liquid helium .\n\u201c We have to think about how to remove the exhaust from this high-temperature plasma , \u201d he added .\nEven so , the South Korean team is now the toast of the fusion world .\nGiven that there are multiple tokamaks in operation around the world , what has made KSTAR so successful of late ?\nIts superconducting magnets suffer no heat loss , Yoon said , while KSTAR also boasts excellence in its ion-heating systems , and offers world-class diagnostics to monitor the plasma .\nUnlike the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fusion offers no such risks .\n\u201c When it comes to safety , nothing can beat fusion , \u201d Yoon said .\n\u201c The issue is sustainability.\n\u201d One reason why South Korea is so advanced in this field is the specializations offered of local industry , which can produce the kind of super-high stress metals and machinery a tokamak requires \u201c We have a well-developed industry for this , \u201d Yoon said .\n\u201c Based on that , we have a lot of advantages.\n\u201d Indeed , Korea leads the world in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key player in steel , construction and engineering .\nHe noted that while KSTAR is a government project \u2013 and as an experimental reactor , is not focusing on commercialization \u2013 major companies have worked on the reactor and its components .\nNameplates on the wall in the KSTAR building include the world \u2019 s leading shipyard , Hyundai Heavy Industries , as well as Samsung Engineering and Construction and Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology .\nStill , KSTAR is hardly alone : A nearby competitor is also winning kudos .\nSince the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Chinese fusion program , EAST \u2013 the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak , in Hefei Province \u2013 accelerated past what looks like an even more impressive landmark .\nOn December 30 , it confined plasma for 1,056 seconds \u2013 more than 11 minutes \u2013 at 70 million degrees Celsius .\n\u201c The recent process of EAST is quite amazing , \u201d Yoon said .\n\u201c But there are two routes here.\n\u201d He explained that with plasma being a combination of ion and electrons , KSTAR works on heating ions , EAST on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different .\n\u201c These are different routes to get to high-performance , steady-state operations , \u201d Yoon said .\n\u201c We are working together with EAST \u2026 this is a competition , but it \u2019 s a good thing.\n\u201d This element of complementary competition is clear ; Chinese personnel are working at the KSTAR site , said Yoon .\nBoth the Chinese and South Korean projects are components in the larger global project that will be the make or break of fusion energy generation .\n\u201c This is not secret , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing the ITER project.\n\u201d In part two of this story , Asia Times will examine how KSTAR contributes to the ITER project , the

dhara with its \u201c clean mineral-rich water \u201d for more than two decades .\nHe says he \u2019 s witnessed a huge difference in water patterns over that time .\n\u201c There are fewer taps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wells and as they do so , the groundwater is falling , \u201d he says .\nEven the annual summer monsoon , which historically ran from June to September , is has been thrown off-kilter by a changing climate .\n\u201c The monsoon shifts every year nowadays , \u201d Tek Karki says .\n\u201c It has become irregular .\nSometimes it comes early and sometimes late.\n\u201d Shekhar Sijapati was born in the house next door to Tek Karki \u2019 s dhunge dhara , and at age 68 still lives here .\nLike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tap that he remembers as \u201c running 24/7.\n\u201d Today , however , Shekhar Sijapati and other residents have to abide by water restrictions \u2014 cut to a mere 30 minutes every four days .\nThe well in his back yard is replenished only during the monsoon , so for the rest of the year Shekhar Sijapati and his wife have to buy water in tanks , for which they \u2019 re paying ever higher prices .\nHe recalls paying the equivalent of about $ 5 for 5,000 liters ( 1,320 gallons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 for the same amount .\nShekhar Sijapati attributes Kathmandu \u2019 s water shortage to the rapid population growth in the valley , along with a modernizing lifestyle .\n\u201c When I was a kid , 800,000 people were living here .\nNow there are over 4 million , \u201d he says .\n\u201c People overconsume .\nWe take long showers and wash [ more ] clothes.\n\u201d Like Tek Karki , Shekhar Sijapati has also noticed a shift in weather patterns .\nDuring his childhood , he says , it rained more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but more intense .\nDuring the torrential rains , the ground can \u2019 t absorb the water fast enough , and it ends up in gutters and rivers , leading to floods .\n\u201c We need to store that water before it \u2019 s lost !\n\u201d he says .\nBut Shekhar Sijapati and many other Kathmandu residents have little choice but to rely on buying water in tanks from private companies that pump it from the ground .\nThese affiliated groups should compete for consumers but are characterized by unscrupulous pricing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the valley \u2019 s households depend on the pipe network as their primary water source , but on average receive water for just 90 minutes every five days from the public utility .\nAbout 15 % of households depend on privately tanked water .\nMany of these consumers live in the city \u2019 s slum areas , where few households are connected to the piped water grid .\nAlready among Kathmandu \u2019 s poorest , they also pay the highest price for water : an average of 40 times what it costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumped up from wells and springs by private companies , is often overpriced for the consumers .\nImage by Jonas Gratzer for Mongabay .\nIn Balkhu , one of the city \u2019 s many slums , fruit seller Lal Pariyar says he spends one-fifth of his earnings on buying fresh water .\nHe used to pay the equivalent of 20 cents for a 25-liter ( 6.6-gallon ) container , but now pays double that .\n\u201c We have no pipes , no wells .\nAnd we are next to a dirty river .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , \u201d he says .\nThe water isn \u2019 t filtered , and he sometimes finds it \u2019 s dirty and contains sediment ; residents have fallen sick from drinking it .\n\u201c But I can not afford to buy water at the supermarket , \u201d Lal Pariyar says .\nNepal isn \u2019 t short of water , thanks to the monsoon rains and the rivers that bring meltwater down from the Himalayan glaciers and snowpack .\nOne of those rivers is the Melamchi , about 25 kilometers ( 15 miles ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supply Project ( MWSP ) is an ambitious , much-delayed effort to pipe water from the river to the city , with the initial phase of the project expected to supply 170 million liters ( 45 million gallons ) per day , or about half of

projects as a national policy , \u201d Shakya tells Mongabay .\nThat \u2019 s the idea , at least .\nThe initial phase of the MWSP was supposed to go online in July 2020 , but delays meant the pipeline only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months it was shut down , a victim of the increasingly unpredictable monsoon : flash floods in June on the Melamchi and Yangri rivers destroyed MWSP infrastructure ,

finish the work .\nFor some in Kathmandu , the solution to the city \u2019 s water woes may lie in the problem : the rains .\nSpecifically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization Smart Paani designs rainwater capture systems for households , schools and businesses .\n( Paani means water in Nepali . )\nThese systems filter the water and recycle it , with Smart Paani touting water savings of up to 50 % .\nFor the typical household , a 5,000-liter tank installed on the roof could collect more than 50 % of annual rainfall , providing sufficient water during the monsoon .\nSmart Paani co-founder Tyler McMahon says drinking filtered rainwater that \u2019 s been harvested from rooftops is a solution that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must first overcome their reluctance to drink rainwater .\n\u201c We need to break the myth that you can \u2019 t drink rainwater , \u201d he says .\nEven then , rainwater harvesting is only part of the wider solution of green infrastructure , McMahon says .\nIn Kathmandu , green infrastructure calls for restoring the remaining ponds and dhunge dhara , as well as the adjacent forests and other green areas , and limiting the drawing of water from aquifers .\nSmart Paani runs one of its water harvesting projects at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2018 , had to buy its water from tanker trucks .\nNow , the school \u2019 s 400 students get their fresh water from the rain , collected in a well and filtered before being piped back into the school building .\nThe school sells surplus water to the local community at a third of the price that the private operators charge for their

inequalities in the world ahead of the 50th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) .\nThe findings of the report on the rapidly growing economic inequalities in India show that the country \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billionaires and the common man is suffering from the problems arising out of the rapidly growing economic inequalities .\nThe Covid pandemic has sharply widened economic inequalities in the country .\nWhile the number of billionaires has increased from 102 to 142 in 2021 , the income of 84 per cent households has declined in India .\nThe expenditure on healthcare has been reduced by 10 per cent from the revised estimates ( 2020-21 ) .\nIn addition , there has been a reduction of 6 per cent for education and 1.5 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 and November 30 , 2021 , the wealth of the country \u2019 s billionaires increased from Rs 23.14 lakh crore to Rs 53.16 lakh crore .\nThe 98 richest Indians in the country have the same wealth as much shared by 552 million bottom people .\nIn 2020 , 46 million Indians are projected to be pushed into abject poverty , which is close to half of the world \u2019 s new poor , according to the United Nations .\nEconomic inequalities are on the rise even when the country \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent and the healthcare infrastructure is on the verge of collapse .\nAccording to the Oxfam report , the one-fifth increase in the wealth of the country \u2019 s 100 richest people is the result of an increase in the wealth of the Adani business family alone .\nThe family ranks second in India and 24th in the world in terms of wealth .\nThe family \u2019 s wealth increased from USD 8.89 billion in 2020 to USD 50.5 billion in 2021 .\nDuring the same period , Mukesh Ambani \u2019 s wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USD 85.5 billion .\nAs many as 13 million women lost their jobs in 2020 due to the Covid pandemic .\nThis figure highlights the fact that growing economic inequalities have plagued women workers during the Covid pandemic .\nWhenever employment declines , the first blow falls on women workers .\nOne of the saddest aspects of the Oxfam report is that in the last four years , the share of Central government revenue from indirect taxes has exceeded direct taxes .\nIn this regard , it is important to know that indirect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of purchase of goods or services like Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) and these taxes are levied on the rich and the poor at the same rate , whereas the ability to pay taxes by the poor is much lower than that of the rich .\nReducing corporate taxes from 30 per cent to 22 per cent has cost the Central government Rs 1.5 lakh crore .\nIn 2016 , the wealth tax imposed on the extremely rich was abolished .\nThese figures highlight the fact that while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Covid pandemic , the tax burden on the common man has increased .\nThe report suggests that a 4 per cent tax on the wealth of the 98 richest people would be sufficient to meet the expenditure of the Mid-Day Meal programme for school children that could be run for 17 years .\nWith just 1 per cent wealth tax revenue , the cost of school education and literacy can be met or the Central government \u2019 s Health Insurance Scheme Ayushman Bharat can be financed for more than 7 years .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the federal structure of the country , the reins of government revenue are left in the hands of the Central government , the states are left to deal with the Covid pandemic , with their insufficient financial and manpower resources .\nAfter the independence of the country , the Planning Commission was set up in 1950 and Five Year Plans were introduced from 1951 .\nThe period from 1951-80 is considered the planning period .\nDuring the planning period , there was establishment and expansion of the public sector , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private sector .\nVarious research studies , and government data show that economic inequalities in the country decreased during this period .\nAfter 1980 , planning was put in reverse gear and the NDA government replaced the Planning Commission with the pro-capitalist/pro-corporate NITI Aayog .\nThe \u2018 New Economic Policies \u2019 of liberalization , privatization , and globalization adopted in the country since 1991 have weakened the public sector enterprises and it has severely curtailed monitoring and regulation of the private sector .\nDue to these reasons , not only the economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also the income of a large section of the workers is also declining , a fact which has been brought to the fore in this Oxfam report .\nAbout half of the country \u2019 s population depends on agriculture for their livelihood .\nAccording to official figures , this half population of the country was given about 16 per cent of the national income in 2018-19 .\nWith the exception of large farmers , the rest of the peasantry is economically very poor .\nAccording to the latest official data , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country own less than 2.5 acres of land and 17 per cent of the farmers own less than 2.5 acres to less than 5 acres of land .\nThe economic condition of these peasant classes is very poor .\nThe economic condition of the two pillars of the agrarian economy \u2014 agricultural labourers , and rural artisans is very miserable as they have no other means of production except to sell their labour .\nThe use of machinery , and herbicides in the package of \u2018 New Agricultural Technology-NAT \u2019 adopted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the agricultural sector , with the greatest impact being on agricultural labourers , and rural artisans .\nResearch studies conducted in different parts of the country have revealed the fact that except the large farmers , the rest of the peasantry , agricultural labourers , and rural artisans have so much debt on their heads that they are not in a position to even pay the interest on the debt as these sections have to borrow only to keep the stove burning for two times meal , which takes the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time .\nDebt and extreme poverty are like twins , when one grows the other follows .\nDebt on the part of these peasants , agricultral labourers , and rural artisans , and extreme poverty among them , manifests itself in the form of increasing suicides .\nThe percentage of informal employment in the total employment is increasing rapidly after the adoption of \u2018 New Economic Policies \u2019 in the country .\nAbout 95 per cent of employment is informal .\nThe uncertainty of finding even such employment , very low wage rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the lives of informally employed workers miserable .\nIn different parts of the country , mechanization , automated machines , and the use of artificial intelligence are reducing employment at a large scale .\nRising unemployment reduces the income of the working class as well as increases economic inequalities .\nFor making the lives of people livable and the progress of the country , along with the taxes suggested by Oxfam the economic development model should be pro-people and nature-friendly .\nWe will have to establish again a mixed economy consisting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @

promises to become a throbbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states ( to a large extent , it already is ) , awaiting submarine insertions , naval manoeuvres , and more troop rotations .\nWith the AUKUS arrangements being firmed up , US and UK sailors , personnel and miscellaneous staff are being readied for more time Down Under , ensuring that Australia becomes a staging ground for future forward military operations .\nCanberra has relinquished much say in this ; the song sheets and blueprints are coming from elsewhere .\nThe UK , reprising its long history of using Australia for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massage the recently minted AUKUS agreement .\nLast week , the UK Secretary of Defence Ben Wallace and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss met Dutton and Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne in Sydney for annual AUKMIN talks .\nThe meeting had a distinctly nostalgic note to it : maternal Britannia , dropping in to see its rather ( territorially ) large offspring .\nThe joint media release prior to the meeting was prosaic but had all the signs of greater UK military involvement in the region , though much of it is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c focus on strategic challenges and identify areas in which Australia and the United Kingdom can work to support an open , inclusive and resilient Indo-Pacific region where the sovereignty of all nations is respected.\n\u201d Pity that Australian sovereignty is being whittled away in this transaction .\nWhile plans to place British \u201c defence assets \u201d in Australia were not inked at the meeting , the idea has received much interest .\nAfter ministerial discussions Dutton told reporters that he was not averse to the idea .\n\u201c In terms of basing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s no proposal on the table to provide additional basing [ but ] it could be something that we discuss at the appropriate time if it \u2019 s suitable to both parties.\n\u201d Payne got into the spirit of \u201c shared values \u201d between the countries , noting \u201c an interest in maintaining the international rule-based order underpinning stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and globally.\n\u201d The most commonly used word used in that regard , notably in Australian strategic lingo , is \u201c complex \u201d .\nThe world has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was somehow simpler before .\nThe region has also evolved into components of complexity , necessitating more defence expenditure for the next war .\nAnd if there was conflict , the countries of the Anglosphere would not be aggressors , nor endorsers of it .\nPayne \u2019 s wittering kept the theme alive .\n\u201c The international environment is becoming more complex and challenging .\nAUKMIN 2022 will consider ways to strengthen our partnership in order to meet new and emerging threats and seize the many opportunities that this era presents.\n\u201d Dutton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can work together in support of a safe and secure Indo-Pacific region.\n\u201d This promises greater militarisation .\nIn the words of the statement , the meeting \u201c will consider ways to strengthen collaboration in defence capability , cyber security , critical technology , deterrence and sustainable investment in infrastructure.\n\u201d What could be expected , stated Dutton was \u201c a greater regularity of visits [ of UK ships and submarines ] , in training , in people being embedded in both services , and certainly a greater cooperation in exercises.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , the defence minister saw parallels in current strategic developments in the Indo-Pacific to the dangerous world of the 1930s and 1940s .\n\u201c We know as a world today that we would be in a very different situation if [ \u2026 ] the United Kingdom had not stood up to malign forces and had not represented the values that they adhere to even to this day.\n\u201d Were these the values of predatory colonisation and understanding of international rules that received such excoriation from Indian Justice Radhabinod Pal ?\nPal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tribunal of the Far East established by the Allied powers to try Japan \u2019 s leaders for war crimes in 1946 , acquitted the high-ranking parties of all charges .\nIn doing so , he trained his judicial mind on Western imperialism , claiming that Japan had been subject to a \u201c sham employment of legal process for the satisfaction of a thirst for revenge.\n\u201d The United Kingdom , he noted , had seized Burma and India ; the Netherlands , Indonesia ; the United States , the Philippines .\nYou do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch of Pal \u2019 s dissenting judgment of 1,235 pages to appreciate his puncturing of the canard that has come to be known as the rule-based international order .\nBehind such neat declarations are not so much legal briefs as guns and gunboats .\nAfter the meeting , Wallace promised that the countries would \u201c lay foundations for training \u201d between Australian and British forces , stressing that \u201c nothing was off the table \u201d .\nThe defence secretary had an eye towards the submarine element of the security arrangement .\nBritain would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we have availability or we

joined at the hip on delivering this program , that the strategic capability that Australia wishes is a step change that will absolutely set them apart as a leader in their field in this part of the

heart of Northeast Asia lie multiple contradictions and unresolved issues left over from Japan \u2019 s militarist and colonialist past .\nAuthor Wada has written prolifically on both Japan-North Korea and Japan-South Korea matters and for the past 20 years has been a tireless advocate of what he calls the \u201c Common Homeland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a post-war and post-Cold War Northeast Asian regional community .\nHere he analyses the policy framework ( established by Abe Shinzo , according to Wada ) of Japan \u2019 s \u201c hostility \u201d towards North Korea and \u201c ignoring \u201d South Korea .\nHe raises questions as to the compatibility of a Northeast Asian community with the recently articulated ( US and Japan-promoted and China-encircling ) \u201c Indo-Pacific \u201d concept .\nWhoever takes office as Prime Minister in Japan inherits the policy towards the Korean peninsula established by former Prime Minister Abe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to solve the abduction problem during his term of office , but is not allowed to cast any doubt on the three Abe principles .\nAll he can do is to wear a Blue-ribbon Badge on his chest.1 Cries of praise for the king \u2019 s new clothes are endless even though everyone knows that he is naked .\nIt is as if we are all living in a children \u2019 s story-book country .\nThe final version of Prime Minister Abe \u2019 s Korea policy was seen in his policy speech to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final Diet sitting of the Heisei era [ 1989-2019 ] .\nHe declared that he would undertake a complete overhaul of post-war Japanese foreign policy , carving out a new diplomatic path for Heisei and beyond .\nAccording to Abe , the security environment had \u201c drastically changed , \u201d and Japan could not just respond by continuing with its established policies .\nHe declared that he would put finishing touches to the global diplomacy that Japan had practiced for the past six years under the banner of \u201c positive pacifism.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would move the now normalized relations with China to a new phase , step up negotiations with Russia towards a peace treaty , and propose a new dialogue with North Korea : \u201c In order to resolve the North Korean nuclear and missile matters , and most important of all the abduction problem , I am prepared to meet face-to-face with Chairman Kim Jong-un , shedding the husk of mutual distrust and acting decisively , missing no opportunity to settle the unfortunate past and normalize inter-state relations .\nI will cooperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States and South Korea.\n\u201d He concluded by declaring his resolve to build a \u201c free and open Indo-Pacific.\n\u201d The Abe speech astonished me because it made no reference whatever to Japan-South Korea relations that had been cause for such concern since the end of 2018 .\nIt seemed to me that Prime Minister Abe was declaring that he was no longer treating South Korea as a negotiating partner .\nIt reminded me of [ former Prime Minister ] Konoe Fumimaro \u2019 s statement during the Sino-Japanese war In January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no negotiation with the Kuomintang government \u201d as he pressed ahead with war against China .\nPeople might be surprised at the difference between earnestly seeking dialogue with North Korea while refusing to deal with South Korea .\nHowever , there is nothing particularly odd about it because what he had said about North Korea was an empty promise designed to give the impression of acting when he had no intention of acting .\nTo his long continuing policy of hostility to North Korea Prime Minister Abe was adding a policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Diet in 1993 , Abe Shinzo became Deputy head of the Parliamentarians \u2019 League for Marking the 50th Anniversary of End of War , under Okuno Seisuke as head .\nIt was his political debut .\nThis organization proposed that there should be no resolution of critical reflection and apology over the Japanese aggression and colonial rule since Japan had fought for \u201c survival and self-defense , \u201d and \u201c peace in Asia.\n\u201d In 1995 their reactionary efforts bore no fruit as a 50th Anniversary of End of War resolution was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Murayama [ Tomiichi ] Statement of apology for colonialism was adopted.2 Two years later , hoping to roll back this trend , Abe organized the Young Parliamentarians \u2019 Association for Reflection on Japan \u2019 s Future and History Education and became its chief executive .\nIts purpose was to oppose the Kono Declaration and the teaching in schools about the Comfort Women issue .\nIn 2000 , when Abe became Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary and set up within government a project team to address the abduction problem , his hardliner proposals attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not informed of the moves leading to the [ Prime Minister ] Koizumi \u2019 s visit to Pyongyang in 2002 , but he accompanied Koizumi and subsequently garnered to himself the political support of the Sukuukai , the National Association for the Rescue of Japanese Kidnapped by North Korea , rapidly emerging as the leader of North Korea negotiation .\nThe abduction issue was the key to his political rise .\nEventually becoming Prime Minister in 2006 , he identified the abduction as the key issue of his Cabinet .\nIn his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Diet , he spoke as follows : \u201c Without resolution of the abduction problem there can be no normalization of relations with North Korea .\nIn order to advance comprehensive measures on the abduction issue , I have set up an Abduction Measures HQ , headed by myself , with a full-time secretariat .\nUnder the policy of dialogue and pressure , we will continue to strongly demand the return of all abductees , based on the premise that all abductees are still alive.\n\u201d At the time of the Pyongyang meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thirteen people , of whom eight had died and five survived .\nNo matter how shocking the announcement of the eight deaths , and how unsatisfactory the explanations of the circumstances of their deaths , for Japan to insist the victims who were presumed dead were \u201c all alive , \u201d and to demand their return , was to treat the North Korean government as liars .\nBreaking off diplomatic negotiations and issuing this ultimatum was tantamount to simply demanding submission .\nThis measure was undoubtedly in accordance with the thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who declared \u201c So long as the Kim Jong-il government exists it will be difficult to have any resolution of the abduction problem.\n\u201d In 2006 , launching an \u201c North Korean Human Rights Violation Awareness Week , \u201d Abe put out a newspaper advertisement pronouncing the North Korean abductions problem \u201c the greatest problem Japan faces.\n\u201d It became the first principle of the Abe Government \u2019 s North Korea policy .\nThe second principle was that \u201c without resolution of the abduction problem , there can not be any normalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the third was that \u201c all the abduction victims are alive , and all must be returned.\n\u201d From this time , all members of the Abe government took to wearing on their chest the Blue Ribbon Badge designed by Sukuukai .\nThus , the Pyongyang Declaration \u2019 s admission of the \u201c great damage and pain caused to the Korean people by Japan \u2019 s colonial control , \u201d and Japan \u2019 s \u201c heartfelt apology , \u201d were forgotten .\nThe Japanese posture of thoroughly pursuing North Korea \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Korea started its nuclear tests , sanctions were imposed , and relations between Japan and North Korea quickly reached a state of complete breakdown , with trade and shipping cut off .\nThis Abe policy towards North Korea was softened under the subsequent Fukuda Yasuo government ( 2008-9 ) but then revived under Aso Taro government ( 2009-2010 ) and elevated to national policy under the following Democratic Party government ( 2009-2012 ) .\nUnder the Abe three principles , negotiations were impossible as one would have expected .\nNo matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jon-il government could not be made to collapse .\nThen once Abe took office the second time around in 2012 and received the petition of the Kazokukai [ Association of Abductee Families ] , he spoke of having been re-elected Prime Minister again in order to solve the abduction problem .\nHe approved the Stockholm Agreement [ 2014 ] which was brought forward through the efforts of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , and eventually requested the reopening of investigation of the abduction problem .\nHowever , when the interim report came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died , Abe refused to accept it on the basis of his third principle .\nNorth Korea thereupon dissolved its re-investigation process .\nAs tension between US and North Korea reached a peak in 2017 , Prime Minister Abe supported the President Trump position that all options were on the table .\nAbe went into a war mode , making statement such as that Japan would \u201c step up pressure against North Korea , \u201d and \u201c strengthen Japan \u2019 s defence capabilities and do its best.\n\u201d Under the 2015 revised security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to align the Self Defence Forces with the US military .\nCommunications were opened on a regular and ongoing basis between Kawano Katsutoshi , Chief of the Joint Staff of the Self-Defence Forces , General Joseph Dunford , Chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , and [ Admiral ] Harry Harris , US Pacific Commander-in-chief , and battle plans are said to have been drawn up .\nHowever , fortunately US and North Korean leaders pulled back from the brink of extreme confrontation and suddenly shifted towards the June 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Prime Minister Abe hastened to the US before the summit and called for \u201c maximum pressure \u201d and cooperation in solving the abduction problem .\nHowever , following the agreement between the US and North Korea , he too had to show he was ready for a summit [ with North Korea ] .\nBut the three Abe principles would remain in place .\nHe would wear the mask of dialogue , but his hostility towards North Korea would not change .\nHis January 2019 policy speech was a consequence of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the \u201c Ignore South Korea \u201d Policy Why was the \u201c Ignore South Korea \u201d policy adopted on top of the hostility policy towards North Korea ?\nUndoubtedly , Japan-South Korea relations had worsened since the end of 2018 , with the South Korean Supreme Court judgements on the forced labour cases,3 the dissolution of the Reconciliation and Healing Foundation set up under the 2015 Japan-Korea agreement on the Comfort Women issue,4 and the [ December 2018 ] incident of a South Korean naval vessel \u2019 s locking its radar onto a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHowever , the Abe government \u2019 s dissatisfaction with President Moon Jae-in had been growing even before this time .\nFor Prime Minister Abe , who was intent on having the Kono statement rescinded , the 2015 Comfort Women agreement was difficult to swallow .\nBut he was in a bind , under pressure from the persistent demands from South Korean president Park Geun-hye and also from the US .\nBiting his lip , for the first time he admitted government responsibility and apologized , and for the first time his government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards helping the comfort women victims restore their honour and heal their psychological wounds .\nAbe attached conditions to the agreement : the apology was to be only in the form of a press conference by the Minister of Foreign Affairs , with no public text , and the disbursement out of public funds was to be one-off , with no follow-up measures .\nThe Korean side should be understood to have agreed to take no further steps on apology in the form of a statement in documentary form , both Foreign Minster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut with the advent of the Moon Jae-in presidency in South Korea the agreement was re-examined and opened to criticism from a victim-centred perspective .\nWhen the Government of South Korea appropriated one billion yen , proposing it substitute for the one billion put forward by Japan , the Japanese government reacted strongly .\nThe problem was the breach of the agreement \u2019 s \u201c final and irreversible \u201d clause .\nThat sentiment was reinforced by the Supreme Court decision in the forced labour case .\nSuch criticism was created that raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and final \u201d clause in the Claims Agreement [ of 1965 ] was a breach of international law .\n3 .\nSubsequent Development \u2013 Diplomatic Re-orientation and the Shift from North to South The entry in the Diplomatic Bluebook also changed in 2019 .\nIt simply recorded the facts of the Japan-South Korea confrontation without reference to \u201c shared basic values , \u201d \u201c shared strategic interest \u201d or being \u201c indispensable for the peace and security of the Asia-Pacific region.\n\u201d In that year , when President Moon participated in the G20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prime Minister Abe deliberately avoided him , not exchanging even small talk .\nThen in July the Government of Japan notified the South Korean government that it had decided to suspend the special measures concerning the export of materials essential for semi-conductor manufacture .\nSince semi-conductor manufacture is of critical significance for the South Korean economy this was clearly a hostile act .\nSouth Korea experienced great shock .\nThe Government of Japan went on to delete South Korea from its list of \u201c white countries \u201d entitled to preferential trade control measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea was not to be trusted on security matters , South Korea then threatened withdrawal from GSOMIA [ the three-sided 2016 \u201c General Security of Military Information Agreement \u201d ] with Japan .\nThe geo-political understanding spread through Japan \u2019 s media that the relationship with South Korea was no longer important .\nKawai Katsuyuki , special diplomatic adviser to the Prime Minister , said in a television debate \u201c the 38th parallel has shrunk south to the Tsushima Strait.\n\u201d The selected articles called \u201c The Disease Called Korea , \u201d in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanada suggested the prospect of the whole of the Korean peninsula passing to the Chinese camp , with a continental bloc comprising China , Russia , North Korea confronting a US , Japan , Taiwan bloc ( a league of maritime states ) .\nSuch a view could be found also in the journal Bungei Shunju , whose special issue for September was entitled \u201c Japan-Korea in flames \u2013 the Moon Jae-in government joins the enemy camp.\n\u201d One lead article was entitled \u201c Prospects after the export restrictions : Japan-US alliance versus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hosoya Yuichi , Abe \u2019 s more up-market brain , spoke as follows in Yomiuri Shimbun of 18 August , saying \u201c Geopolitically what counts for Japan is what happens in the two great countries , US and China , and compared to US and China , South Korea is relatively unimportant.\n\u201d When a group of journalists and scholars could not ignore this trend anymore and issued a statement , \u201c Is South Korea the enemy ?\n\u201d on the Internet .\nIn a 4 October policy speech , Abe said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d but went on to say \u201c I think pledges between countries should be faithfully observed , based on international law , \u201d renewing his anti-Korea thinking .\nIn December , he voiced a similar notion in talks with president Moon on the occasion of the Japan-China-Korea leaders meeting at Chengdu in China , saying that everything had been settled by the Japan-Korea treaty of 1965 and that it was against international law for South Korea to make requests of Japan .\nHe did not hesitate to adopt such haughty posture in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2020 Abe resigned because of the worsening of a pre-existing health condition .\nIn his opening speech on 26 October as successor , former Cabinet Secretary Suga Yoshihide adopted in full the Abe line on North and South Koreas .\n\u201c The abduction problem will continue to be the biggest problem the government faces .\nI will do my best to secure the return to Japan of all the victims of abduction at the earliest possible date .\nI am prepared to meet directly and unconditionally with chairman Kim Jong-un .\nBased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Korea I aim at a comprehensive resolution of the abduction , nuclear , and missile problems , settling the unfortunate past , and normalizing relations with North Korea.\n\u201d \u201c South Korea is an extremely important neighbour country .\nGood relations must be restored with it .\nI will be firmly seeking appropriate responses based on the positions Japan has long advanced.\n\u201d However , on this occasion Prime Minister Suga emphasized a \u201c free and open Indo-Pacific.\n\u201d He said , \u201c I have just completed visits to Vietnam and Indonesia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a \u2018 free and open Indo-Pacific , \u2019 based on the rule of law and in cooperation with like-minded countries including ASEAN , Australia , India , the European Union.\n\u201d Later , Prime Minister Suga visited the United States and offered in principle support for US China policy and cooperation in implementing the QUAD [ Japan-US-Australia-India ] security cooperation agreement .\nIt meant distancing from Northeast Asia , shifting orientation southwards , and joining with the US in applying pressure on China .\nUnder pressure from popular mistrust over his handling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suga resigned after just over a year and Kishida Fumio took over on October 3 , 2021 .\nSince it was he who , as Foreign Minister , had announced the 2015 Comfort Women agreement , one might think that he would strive to improve Japan-South Korean relations , making the most of the agreement , but such expectations were quickly dashed because , no sooner did Kishida take over as Prime Minister than , in response to a written Diet question from the Democratic Party \u2019 s Nataniya Masayoshi , on 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 .\nNataniya , referring to the following part of the Kishida statement in the 2015 agreement , \u201c The issue of comfort women , with an involvement of the Japanese military authorities at that time , was a grave affront to the honor and dignity of large numbers of women , and the Government of Japan is painfully aware of responsibilities from this perspective .\nAs Prime Minister of Japan , Prime Minister Abe expresses anew his most sincere apologies and remorse to all the women who underwent immeasurable and painful experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as comfort women , \u201d 5 asked whether , now as Prime Minister , Kishida intended to confirm and maintain such stance .\nKishida replied evasively : \u201c On the matter of the comfort women , following discussions we secured the pledge of the government of South Korea to the agreement .\nKorean Foreign Minister Yun Byong-se declared in front of the people of Japan and South Korea and addressing international society\u2026 that the Comfort Women agreement was \u2018 resolved finally and irreversibly.\n\u2019 \u201d He hid the fact that Japan has apologised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue has been finally settled .\nIf that is the way Kishida runs away from the Korea issue , it is no surprise that his policy speech on 8 October was all about a \u201c free and open Indo-Pacific.\n\u201d He said Japan would \u201c cooperate with allied and like-minded countries such as the US , Australia , India , ASEAN , the EU , engaging actively in the Japan-US-Australia-India group to promote a \u2018 free and open Indo-Pacific.\n\u2019 \u201d The words he used in referring to the abductions were not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had used .\nKishida met the Association of Abductee Families for talks , and on 13 November participated in a National Assembly to Demand Immediate and Total Return of all Abductees , where he referred to the abduction problem as \u201c the most important problem facing the Kishida government \u201d and said , \u201c I strongly believe that I am going to be the one to settle the Comfort Women problem.\n\u201d Most likely nobody among his audience believed that Kishida had any willingness to act or he thought he could act .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Japan ?\nThough negotiations began 30 years ago on normalization of Japan-North Korea relations , normalization has still not been accomplished and North Korea has become a nuclear armed country .\nThat is the core of today \u2019 s crisis for Japan .\nIf Kishida , a Prime Minister elected from a constituency that includes Hiroshima , victim of atomic bomb attack , is to speak of his ambition for a \u201c world free from nuclear weapons \u201d he should surely devote his every effort to deal with the nuclear weapons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2017 North Korea launched four intermediate range ballistic missiles , three of which landed at a point 300 kilometres offshore from Akita City .\nOn the following day , Korean Central News Agency announced that the missiles had been launched by [ North Korean ] artillery units that \u201c were responsible for attacking enemy US imperialist bases in Japan in the case of unanticipated events.\n\u201d It made clear that in the event of war between US and North Korea , North Korea would launch missile attacks on US bases in Japan .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ great the nuclear defences , it is impossible to completely block such an attack .\nIf North Korea contemplated how nuclear weapons might be used , the US would too far , and South Korea would be too near .\nWe can not be complacent and just think that Japan is protected by the US nuclear umbrella , will be OK because of the US-Japan Security Treaty .\nOne of the most urgent tasks for Japan is to take active measures to eliminate such catastrophic possibility .\nWhat the Japan that ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat or use of force as means of solving international disputes \u201d has available to it is peace diplomacy .\nIf it really wants to block North Korean missiles it must aim to normalize the Japan-North Korea relationship and establish non-antagonistic , normal , and if possible , friendly and cooperative relations .\nIt is clear that from such a viewpoint , the antagonistic Abe North Korean policy is the worst policy , exposing peace and security in Japan to crisis .\nThe Abe policies must be reversed .\nTo solve the abduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to revert to diplomatic negotiations with North Korea .\nIn the present circumstances , following the precedent of President Obama \u2019 s unconditional resumption of US relations with Cuba , normalization based on the Pyongyang Declaration could be implemented and ambassadors exchanged immediately .\nGermany , Canada , Australia,6 the Philippines all have diplomatic relations with North Korea .\nIf Japan too were to open diplomatic relations negotiations could begin in Tokyo and Pyongyang on nuclear weapons and missiles and on economic cooperation and abductions .\nFor the nuclear and missile problems especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOn the abductions , the demand for all abduction victims to be returned alive should be dropped and replaced by the demand for the return of survivors and compensation for all victims .\nThe issues that require protracted negotiation should be given time .\nOnce diplomatic relations are opened , cultural exchange and humanitarian aid could be undertaken forthwith .\nUnder cultural exchange probably an exhibition on the victims of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at Major cities in North Korea should be included .\nAs for economic cooperation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be included and , if agreed , the outcome synchronized with agreement on nuclear and missile matters .\nThings would just have to proceed through gaining the understanding and support of stakeholder countries .\nIt is clear that the support and cooperation of South Korea is going to be necessary whether for normalizing Japan-North Korea relations or for reducing to zero the possibility of war between the US and North Korea .\nFor that reason , the policy of \u201c ignoring South Korea \u201d is a fatal error .\nCurrently the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign Affairs , takes the view that matters to do with Japan-Korea relations were all resolved by the 1965 normalization treaties .\nHowever , the Japanese government , who at the time of signing of the 1965 treaties had an understanding that there was no need for Japan to regret or apologize , since the annexation [ of Korea by Japan in 1910 ] was in accord with a treaty and therefore legal , did listen to the criticisms by South Korea after the democratisation of 1987 , and from the Kono Statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude of reflecting on and apologizing for the harm and pain caused by the colonial rule .\nThis was the basis of the 2010 Prime Minister Kan Naoto Statement and the 2015 Comfort Women agreement .\nIt is a counter-historical outrage for things to have reached the current point where the slate is wiped clean of such developments and the Japanese government revert to the attitudes of the 1965 Japan-South Korea normalization treaty time .\nThe aggressiveness of the 35 years of Japanese colonial rule of Korea is an un-deniable historical fact when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koreas , and the need for the Japanese people to repent and apologize knows no end .\nIt is precisely through repentance and apology for colonial rule that we will be able to live in a normal , human cooperative relationship with people of South Korea and North Korea .\nUnless we build a situation in which the six countries \u2013 South Korea , North Korea , Russia , China , the US , and Japan can live together at peace , in a \u201c common house , \u201d 7 it will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and North Korea , the US and North Korea , Japan and China , the US and China , and China and Taiwan .\nIt is unlikely that the good ship Japan is going to be able to sail in free and open Indo-Pacific waters so long as Japan adopts a hostile attitude , or ignores , the people of the Korean peninsula .\nNote to

fear that the crisis of impunity is about to get far worse in the Philippines .\nOn Monday , the Commission on Elections ( Comelec ) handed the scion of the Marcos family , Ferdinand \u201c Bongbong \u201d Marcos Jr , a major victory after striking down a petition to cancel his certificate of candidacy ( CoC ) .\nThe ex-dictator \u2019 s son has thus cleared a major hurdle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his

throughout the subsequent decades .\nHaving narrowly lost the vice-presidential race in 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontrunner to replace current president Rodrigo Duterte .\nSince he expressed his bid for the presidency last year , various civic groups , including several human rights victims of the Marcos dictatorship period , have filed as many as five petitions to prevent the return of the notorious

globalresearch_crg .\nThe relative success of the populist right-wing Japan Innovation Party ( Nippon Ishin no Kai or JIP ) , which increased its vote to emerge as the third-largest party in the recent elections , has paved the way for the country to revise its 75-year-old Peace Constitution .\nThis constitution , which was drafted by US occupying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bars the country from officially maintaining armed forces .\nThe constitution \u2019 s key clause is Article 9 .\nThis denies Japan the right to possess an army , navy or air force .\nIt also makes Japan \u2019 s use of belligerence to resolve international disputes illegal .\nYet , driven by hawkish factions of the dominant ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , in recent decades Tokyo has increasingly ramped up its remilitarisation .\nIn fact , Japan now ranks as the world \u2019 s ninth biggest military spender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would appear to be constitutional revision .\nSomething that could likely now be enacted , with recent election results having empowered the opposition JIP , who also support such a move .\nSo how has this shift occurred and does it mean that Japan \u2019 s pacifism is dead ?\nThe simple answer to the latter is \u201c no \u201d .\nJapan \u2019 s constitution was drafted and imposed by the postwar occupying American authorities as a means to prevent Japan ever again becoming a military threat .\nBut its pacifist thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens who were keen to remake their country \u2019 s image and reconstruct its identity .\nJapanese school education still places a heavy emphasis on the virtues and merits of peace .\nJapan boasts some of the most active and longstanding pacifist NGOs and societies in the world .\nAnd more than half of its population remain not only opposed to war , but in favour of retaining Article 9 .\nThese aspects of Japanese civil society are closely linked to Japan \u2019 s status as the only victim of nuclear warfare .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan as a victim of the horrors of war , rather than as a brutal wartime aggressor .\nHowever , in the political sphere , the last four decades have witnessed a sea-change .\nParticularly following the bursting of Japan \u2019 s economic bubble in 1991 , Japan faced a crisis of national identity .\nAs unemployment rose and standards of living fell , nationalist politicians looked for an external target towards which public discontent could be redirected .\nAs a result , the government \u2019 s anti-miltarist approach to foreign policy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom years of the 1960s-1980s , was questioned .\nConservative political actors began to target Japan \u2019 s pacifism as a source of weakness .\nThis was made easier by a sabre-rattling North Korea and a rising China , both of which were recalibrated as grave risks to Japan \u2019 s security .\nThis narrative was led by Japan \u2019 s two most successful recent prime ministers , Junichiro Koizumi and Shinzo Abe .\nBoth rose to power on the back of a hawkish foreign policy stance , including the proposed revision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a substantive shift to the right across Japan \u2019 s major political parties , to the point where promoting pacifism is no longer politically viable .\nThe culmination of these winds of change is evident from the latest election results , which saw Fumio Kishida , who had assumed the prime ministership when he won control of the LDP in a leadership election just prior to the October general election , retain power for the party , albeit with a reduced majority .\nKishida is considered more moderate and less hawkish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-term successor , Yoshihide Suga .\nBut with an increased number of seats gained by the JIP , the newly elected prime minister is likely to be swayed by the growing momentum for legislative changes .\nThe combined forces of LDP , JIP and \u2013 albeit reticently \u2013 junior coalition partner , Komeito , now put those in favour of constitutional revision in a position to enact the necessary legal reforms .\nThis has serious implications .\nDomestically , it reflects the rise and dominance of revisionist conservatism , and the decimation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internationally , it will send alarm bells ringing across the Asia-Pacific .\nAny indication that Japan might revise its constitution is likely to spark angry reactions from Japan \u2019 s former colonies and victims of militarist wartime aggression .\nThis risks worsening relations with two of Japan \u2019 s biggest trading partners in China and South Korea , as well as damaging its regional image as a trustworthy leader of peaceful economic and investment regimes .\nIt could also further isolate Tokyo amid an already tense security environment .\nJapan \u2019 s relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close alignment with its sole alliance partner , the United States , perpetuates tension with a more muscular China .\nThis includes the issue of Taiwan .\nMeanwhile Japan , China and Taiwan all claim the disputed Pinnacle Islands , which are referred to respectively as Senkaku , Diaoyu and Diaoyutai .\nRecent reinterpretations of Article 9 already allow Japan to operate various forms of collective defence with allied countries in exceptional circumstances .\nTokyo also regularly dispatches the Japan Self-Defense Forces ( JSDF ) overseas .\nIn this regard , with American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self defence \u201d , there is little practical need to formally revise a constitution that has served Japan so well during peacetime .\nNote to readers : Please click the

brutal closed border system that has characterised COVID-19 policy in Australia , New Zealand has also been every bit as extreme in limiting the return of its nationals .\nPandemic policy , if not logic , has taken issue with the nature of citizenship , which , truth be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print or the paper .\nIn theory , New Zealanders should have more claim to a right of return than their Trans-Tasman cousins .\nAustralia lacks a charter or bill of rights that protects such entitlements ; New Zealand does not .\nArticle 18 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 outlines provisions on the freedom of movement , including the right for all New Zealand citizens to enter and leave the country .\nAustralians can only rely on the mutable constructs of common law and weak judicial observations .\nAt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ( 1948 ) and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , offer mild protections that have done little to make governments in Australia and New Zealand more tolerant of their returning citizens during these pandemic times .\nThe barriers placed upon returning citizens have been onerous , including cost of air travel and those associated with managed isolation .\nGranted return spots are overseen by the Managed Isolation and Quarantine ( MIQ ) body .\nThe immigration website of the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter New Zealand .\n\u201c The border is currently closed to almost all travellers to help stop the spread of COVID-19.\n\u201d Epidemiologists have also been busy drumming up concerns about such new variants as Omicron , suggesting that further limits are necessary .\nOne is Otago University \u2019 s Michael Baker , who is more keen on the process of containment than the legal implications of citizenship .\n\u201c A big change is the virus is now more infectious and we \u2019 re seeing more people arriving in New Zealand in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities .\nOur risk has risen , our responses need to rise up to this challenge and manage it.\n\u201d In reference to a returnee who had tested negative on two occasions for the virus while in MIQ , only to then receive a positive test result when released into the community , Baker felt that \u201c timing suggests most likely \u201d that the infection took place at the facility itself .\nFor New Zealanders already struggling to return , Baker suggested the \u201c need to turn down the tap.\n\u201d Legal authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to return might well be protected by the Bill of Rights , but it was hardly absolute .\nThe government had its own obligations to protect those in New Zealand from COVID-19 , which justified placing caps on numbers .\nThere is also the competing interest of protecting the healthcare system .\nThen there are the \u201c rights that flow from having a robust economy , including the right to an adequate standard of living.\n\u201d Reading such lines of priority yields only one , sorry conclusion .\nIf you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be outside the country , best lump it .\nParochial considerations are to be prioritised .\n\u201c So yes , there is a right to return , \u201d writes the unconcerned Gledhill , \u201c but it is a right that can be delayed to protect those already here.\n\u201d An example of such a tolerable delay came when a pregnant New Zealand journalist based in Afghanistan found it impossible to return to her country to give birth .\nCharlotte Bellis , in a piece explaining her circumstances , noted how she \u201c started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 3am and staring at my computer , only to miss out time and again.\n\u201d She resigned from Al Jazeera in November , had lost income , health insurance and her residency .\nThe New Zealand government , having promised to open the borders to citizens \u2013 at least in a more liberal way \u2013 by the end of February , postponed matters .\nThe MIQ lottery was suspended .\nApplying for emergency MIQ spots was hardly promising : 5 % of NZ citizens were approved if unable to stay in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted on health and safety grounds .\nAlternatives for Bellis were running out .\nIn a profound twist of fate , she found herself seeking potential assistance from , of all groups , the Taliban .\nShe explained to a senior Taliban contact that she was dating \u201c Jim [ Huylebroek ] from The New York Times , but we \u2019 re not married \u201d .\nThe contact explained that he respected the couple \u2019 s status .\nWere she to come to Kabul , \u201c you won \u2019 t have a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married and if it escalates , call us.\n\u201d Such an observation led Austrian-Afghan journalist Emran Feroz to remark acidly that the media savvy Taliban had taken a distinctly softer approach to non-Afghan journalists .\n\u201c Journalists who were seen as Afghans often faced threats , beatings , torture and murder while non-Afghans \u2026 had tons of privileges and were welcomed and treated softly by all sides.\n\u201d Muzhgan Samarqandi , a former broadcaster from Afghanistan having recently emigrated to New Zealand , felt the red mist descending on seeing reactions to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , she raged , had been \u201c trivialised \u201d .\n\u201c If a person in power extends privileges to someone who doesn \u2019 t threaten their power , it doesn \u2019 t mean they are not oppressive , extremist , or dangerous.\n\u201d Bellis had certainly done herself few favours on that score , having secured a degree of approval amongst Taliban circles , much to the chagrin of an Afghan journalistic community that has suffered abductions , torture , and killings .\nIn one interview , she is found stating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectfully \u201d and had \u201c never intimidated me .\nI \u2019 m surprised at the image of them around the world , that they \u2019 re so inhuman.\n\u201d With such assurance , it is little wonder that Bellis had little concern querying the Taliban on their record on treating girls and women .\nIn journalistic terms , she provides the tinsel and baubles .\nAll focus , and energy , turned to seeking entry into New Zealand .\nDespite the assistance of lawyer Tudor Clee , letters from New Zealand obstetricians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth in Afghanistan , including levels of induced stress \u2013 all in all , 59 documents submitted to MIQ and Immigration NZ , the couple received their rejection notice on January 24 .\nWith characteristic , border control peevishness , the authorities took issue with travel dates being more than 14 days out .\nInsufficient evidence had been provided to show that Bellis had \u201c a scheduled medical treatment in New Zealand \u201d , that it was \u201c time-critical \u201d and that she could not \u201c obtain or access the same treatment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case was drummed up .\nThe PR channels were worked .\nPoliticians took notice .\nSuddenly , the MIQ application status was changed from \u201c deactivated \u201d to \u201c in progress \u201d .\nHer partner was duly informed that he had received a visa and could apply for an emergency MIQ spot .\nThe Bellis example suggests an unsavoury practice at work in the NZ COVID-19 border protection regime .\nClee , having taken to court eight cases where pregnant New Zealand citizens were rejected , has seen MIQ budge just before court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to see what is at play here .\n\u201c It \u2019 s an effective way to quash a case and avoid setting a legal precedent that would find that MIQ does in fact breach New Zealand \u2019 s Bill of Rights.\n\u201d COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins was untroubled about the distinctly flawed methodology used by MIQ .\nThe policy had \u201c served New Zealand exceptionally well , saved lives and hospital admissions and kept our health system from being swamped.\n\u201d All Bellis had to do was apply for a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chris Bunny , in commenting on the Bellis case , saw little problem with the way it had been managed .\n\u201c It is not uncommon for people who have been declined an emergency allocation to reach out to a Member of Parliament.\n\u201d The fact that such a case would even have to happen never bothers Bunny .\nForget human rights ; it \u2019 s the contacts and standing that count .\nIf you can scream loudly enough

\u201d Ahmad Ramadhan , a spokesman for the National Police , said at a Jan. 25 press conference .\n\u201c Some of them are employed at the palm oil mill owned by the district head with the aim to

claimed billions in an accelerated depreciation scheme , one of the federal government \u2019 s corporate pandemic welfare measures that was introduced just as income protection measures for the

frontrunner so far is setting himself apart from rivals on perhaps the most sensitive of them all : China .\nFerdinand \u201c Bongbong \u201d Marcos , the son of a former dictator and ally of outgoing President Rodrigo Duterte , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue Duterte \u2019 s pro-Beijing foreign policy while downplaying the nation \u2019 s alliance with the United States .\nIn a series of press interviews , Marcos has laid out clearly his position on China , saying in one he would set aside the landmark 2016 Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague ruling on the South China Sea in favor of the Philippines over China , which effectively ruled Beijing \u2019 s nine-dash line claim to the sea had no legal basis under the UNCLOS .\nIn a recent DZRH radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitral win against China was \u201c not effective \u201d and that the \u201c only practical option \u201d for resolving the sea disputes was a bilateral agreement with China .\nHe said , \u201c I think we can come to an agreement .\nAs a matter of fact , people from the Chinese embassy are my friends , we have been talking about that.\n\u201d \u201c Let \u2019 s not talk about war , because that \u2019 s not really an option .\nWe must continue to engage the Chinese , \u201d he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s pronouncements on the South China Sea disputes .\nIn another ABS-CBN network interview , Marcos went further in saying he would dismiss any potential offer of assistance from the United States in negotiating with China , saying , \u201c The problem is between China and us .\nIf Americans come in , it is bound to fail.\n\u201d With the campaign season ready to start in earnest , Marcos \u2019 rivals are expected to step up their portrayal of the frontrunner as a pro-China Manchurian candidate who , like Duterte , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beijing in exchange for economic deals and other financial inducements .\nAll of the other major candidates , including Vice-President Leni Robredo , Senators Manny Pacquiao and Panfilo Lacson , and Manila Mayor Isko Moreno , have all taken overtly hawkish and nationalistic positions on China \u2019 s pressure on Philippine-claimed features and territory in the South China Sea .\nWhen it comes to China relations , history is on Marcos \u2019 side .\nOf all the major Philippine political dynasties , the Marcoses have the longest ties with China \u2019 s communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cold War , then-dictator Ferdinand Marcos , Bongbong \u2019 s father , was among the first Asian leaders to ditch the US-aligned government in Taipei in favor of establishing formal bilateral relations with Communist China .\nDuring the dictator \u2019 s official visit to Beijing in 1974 , which reinforced the Sino-American d\u00e9tente and Beijing \u2019 s charm offensive across Southeast Asia , Marcos was accompanied by his entire family , including then heir-apparent Bongbong , who met and greeted Chinese paramount leader Mao Zedong .\nOver the years , the Marcoses \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ally , turned increasingly contentious amid disagreements over human rights issues and strategic rents for America \u2019 s large-scale bases in the Philippines .\nThe Marcoses are known to hold a grudge against the Americans for abandoning them during the 1986 People Power revolt , which forced them into temporary exile in Hawaii .\nSince their return in 1991 , the Marcoses have gradually worked their way back to the center of Philippine politics by exploiting weaknesses in the country \u2019 s elite-driven democracy and building powerful cartels with other political dynasties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have had almost uninterrupted control over the northern province of Ilocos Norte , also maintain warm relations with the Chinese-Filipino business community and have courted investment ties with China in their bailiwicks .\nMarcos Jr is now running in tandem with presidential daughter Sara Duterte , who decided to withdraw her presidential bid to head off a direct clash with the son of the former dictator .\nMarcos Jr has presented himself as a candidate of continuity , vowing to protect the current president from any future prosecution over human rights-related issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs campaign , as well as building on Duterte \u2019 s policies , including his China embrace .\nAt the same time , Marcos has barely mentioned the Philippines \u2019 alliance with the US and its historically warm relations with Western countries , perhaps reflecting the family \u2019 s lingering resentment toward the US .\nSome suggest the urbane and softly-spoken Marcos Jr could prove more successful in appeasing Beijing \u2019 s ambitions in the South China Sea without the Duterte administration \u2019 s frequent resort to pugnacious language and threats .\nLast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks ahead of his official registration for the presidential race , Marcos Jr indicated his preference for staying the course of maintaining friendly ties with Beijing regardless of intensifying disputes in the South China Sea .\n\u201c The policy of engagement , which the Duterte government is implementing , although it is criticized , it is the right way to go .\nBecause whatever we do , we can \u2019 t go to war , \u201d said Marcos Jr , regurgitating the incumbent president \u2019 s insistence on strategic subservience towards the Asian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to do that , I don \u2019 t think the Chinese want to go to war with us .\nCertainly , we don \u2019 t want to go to war with China , \u201d he added , insisting that adopting a friendly posture was the only viable option for the Philippines .\nMarcos Jr \u2019 s stance has clearly already pleased Beijing .\nDuring a meeting with the presidential candidate last year , China \u2019 s ambassador to Manila Huang Xilian was full of praises for the Marcoses .\n\u201c Hanging on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of China-Philippines relations , one of which on the top has depicted the historic scene of

\u201d Huang said , referring to the background picture during his high-profile meeting with Marcos Jr .\nThe Chinese envoy emphasized the need for maintaining friendly relations \u201c so as to bring more benefits to our two peoples and pass on our traditional friendship from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take less kindly to Vice-President Robredo \u2019 s candidacy .\nShe recently said if elected she would

Sea.\n\u201d The language of coalition-building to counter China \u2019 s regional ambitions , including in the South China Sea , obviously echoes that of the Biden administration .\nThat would appear to put Marcos and Robredo on opposite sides of US-China rivalry for influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stark choice on foreign policy matters .\n\u201c We must understand that we are a tiny tiny nation caught in between two superpowers , \u201d Marcos said in a mixture of Filipino and Tagalog in a recent press interview where he ruled out tighter security cooperation with Washington to check China \u2019 s ambitions During the lengthy interview , observers noticed he barely mentioned the Philippine-US Mutual Defense Treaty , which obliges Washington to come to the Philippines \u2019 assistance in the event of any armed conflict in the South China Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcos echoed the same position , arguing that leveraging defense ties with the US is a \u201c recipe for disaster , which would ensure

dragons have been breathing fire of late , and these need to be slayed .\nOne is the notion that Australia has had some miraculous sense of bipartisan understanding about national security , its politicians well briefed , cooperative and objective on the subject .\nThe second is that politicising intelligence and national security are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own modest contribution to sinking these assumptions .\nIt is , after all , an election year .\nThere is a schoolboy simplicity to the effort : scream various words such as \u201c appeasement \u201d often enough , and it will take hold .\nReiterate the term \u201c Manchurian Candidate \u201d , and hope it cakes opponents .\nIn the Australian Parliament , Prime Minister Scott Morrison demonstrated this month that accusation as politics without evidence governs his operating rationale .\nAs he has done previously in attempting to paint the Labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told the chamber that the Labor Deputy Opposition leader Richard Marles was a \u201c Manchurian Candidate \u201d .\nEver helpful , the Defence Minister Peter Dutton went one position higher with his claim that the Labor leader , Anthony Albanese , was well favoured in Beijing .\n\u201c We now see evidence that the Chinese Communist Party , the Chinese government has also made a decision about who they will back in the next federal election , and that is open and obvious.\n\u201d Not exactly a masterpiece of literary narrative ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readable melange , \u201d was a description offered by Frederic Morton ) , the 1959 novel by Richard Condon of that same name captured the Cold War zeitgeist of paranoia .\nIt features the deeds of a sleeper agent , one Sergeant Raymond Shaw , who returns from service in the Korean War .\nWith ten other men , Shaw served in an Intelligence and Reconnaissance patrol subsequently captured and brainwashed by the Chinese .\nOn their release , they are convinced that Shaw saved them , bare two .\nThe seed is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in effect , a manipulable assassin , his mind able to be triggered by a game of solitaire and the queen of diamonds .\nThe chief brainwasher explains the reason for picking this stepson of a US Senator .\n\u201c Although the paranoiacs make the great leaders , it is the resenters who make their best instruments because the resenters , those men with cancer of the psyche , make the great assassins.\n\u201d Shaw also has the misfortune of being controlled by his devilishly scheming mother Eleanor Iselin , intent on seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as she pushes the vice-presidential aspirations of her husband , Shaw \u2019 s lacklustre stepfather .\nJohn Frankenheimer \u2019 s 1962 film adaptation of the book , featuring Lawrence Harvey as Shaw , Frank Sinatra as Major Bennett Marco , with Angela Lansbury in the role of Eleanor Iselin , has been considered a classic despite failing at the box office .\nA preposterous plotline is rendered seductive through aesthetic sequences and visualisation .\nFilm historian David Thomson saw the link between pulp and celluloid ; Condon \u2019 s book was \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it.\n\u201d Even if most Australian politicians would have only a nodding acquaintance with the work and its filmography , the cultural , denigrative baggage of the term remains .\nMorrison \u2019 s resort to it even smoked out the chief of ASIO , the Australian domestic intelligence service .\n\u201c I \u2019 ll leave the politics to the politicians , \u201d Mike Burgess observed in his interview with the 7.30 Report , \u201c but I am very clear with everyone that I need to be , that that is not helpful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Office of National Assessments , Allan Gyngell , is dismissive about any significant differences between the Labor opposition and the governing Coalition on China .\n\u201c An effective wedge has to be made out of something more than wishful thinking , \u201d he surmises .\n\u201c The language will differ person to person , but on the key policy issues , which is what matters \u2013 the Quad , foreign interference , 5G \u2013 I think it \u2019 s clear.\n\u201d Gyngell arcs up at the use of the word \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u201c it has a very specific meaning in international relations , and none in which it is being used here seem applicable.\n\u201d Former ASIO director-general Dennis Richardson , in reproaching any effort to create \u201c artificial \u201d differences between the Coalition and Labor on the issue of China , proceeds to claim an artificial construction of his own .\n\u201c The tradition in Australia has been that governments seek to promote bipartisanship on critical national security issues.\n\u201d Constant airing of the view that Australian politics remains , at its centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been repeatedly shown to be fable and nonsense .\nAustralia \u2019 s history of politicising intelligence and security threats is extensive and disturbingly remarkable .\nAs Justin McPhee shows in his landmark study Spinning the Secrets of State , Australian politicians have been habitually addicted to politicising matters regarding intelligence to undermine causes and adversaries since the origins of the Commonwealth .\nThe number of instances McPhee notes are too numerous to mention here , but it is worth recalling the use of intelligence by the ruthlessly wily Prime Minister Billy Hughes during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the close links between ASIO and Conservative Coalition governments that kept progressive politics at bay for a generation .\nHardly bipartisan .\nAnd who can ever forget the glacial relationship between the intelligence services and the Labor government of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam , culminating in the police raid of ASIO headquarters on orders by the Attorney General Lionel Murphy ?\nMurphy had suspected ASIO of being less than frank about a possible security threat to the invited Yugoslav Prime Minister D\u017eemal Bijedi\u0107 from disgruntled Croatian nationalists .\nRight wing nationalist movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet communism .\nThis inglorious record existed prior to the sexed-up dossiers of dubious intelligence that were the hallmark of justifying the unlawful invasion of Iraq in 2003 .\nSuch monstrously cooked accounts were based on the dubious premise that Saddam Hussein constituted a mortally grave threat to the interests of Canberra , Washington and London , and had intimate links with al-Qaeda .\nYet Saddam is dead , and the likes of George W.

recognize the role of wartime Korean forced labor at this location .\nJapan \u2019 s previous industrial World Heritage inscription is criticized for similar denials of forced labor history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government has embarked on a \u201c history war \u201d against Korea and the memories of the wartime victims of forced labor .\nIn addition to providing victim testimony , historical sources and local and Korean research reveals that Mitsubishi forced Korean laborers to work in deadly conditions in the Sado mines .\nKorean forced laborers were taken to Sado Island where they faced racial discrimination and abuse .\nThis article explains why Japan chose to worsen relations with Korea by nominating the Sado mines for World Heritage inscription while concealing the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced labor at the site .\nOn January 28th 2022 , Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio announced plans to proceed with the UNESCO World Heritage nomination of the \u201c Sado Gold Mine \u201d , or more accurately the \u201c Sado complex of heritage mines , primarily gold mines \u201d ( hereafter Sado mines ) .\n[ 1 ] The announcement further soured Japan-South Korea relations , as Korea strongly opposes the nomination due to Japan \u2019 s denials of Korean forced labor at Sado and other sites during wartime .\nKishida \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was considering postponing the nomination due to Korea \u2019 s protests , but the decision to go ahead immediately was made at the insistence of former Prime Minister Abe Shinz\u014d .\n[ 2 ] Abe , who still heavily influences the LDP , stated officially on January 20th 2022 that it would be a mistake not to nominate the Sado mines in order to avoid controversy .\n[ 3 ] Following Abe \u2019 s bidding , Kishida established a \u201c history war team \u201d within the cabinet with the purpose of \u201c collecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the international community based on the [ Japanese ] government \u2019 s perception of history.\n\u201d [ 4 ] Foreign Minister Hayashi Yoshimasa announced that the Japanese government \u201c is not giving any diplomatic consideration to South Korea \u201d in this matter .\n[ 5 ] The Sado mines were bought from the government in 1896 by Mitsubishi , which operated the mines during wartime and until their closure in 1989 .\nIn an interview published on the first page of Sh\u016bkan Fuji , January 26th 2022 , Abe Shinz\u014d again denied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sado mines , citing two history books by Mitsubishi .\n[ 6 ] One of these books had a week earlier been cited to disprove the use of forced labor by a member of parliament representing Niigata .\n[ 7 ] Needless to say , history written by the perpetrator is not adequate for disproving allegations of victims .\nD\u014dy\u016b nowarito outcrop in Aikawa , Sado .\nThe mountain was split by Edo period surface mining .\nPhoto by Muramasa ( CC ) , Wikimedia Commons , 2013 .\nThe announcement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNESCO World Heritage inscription in 2023 came in the middle of another ongoing dispute over Korean forced labor history at Japanese industrial heritage sites .\nThe Sites of Japan \u2019 s Meiji Industrial Revolution : Iron and Steel , Shipbuilding and Coal Mining ( hereafter the Meiji Industrial Sites ) , were inscribed by UNESCO in 2015 , on the agreed condition that Japan acknowledge that \u201c a large number of Koreans and others [ \u2026 ] were brought against their will and forced to work under harsh conditions in the 1940s at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] However , the Industrial Heritage Information Centre that opened in Tokyo ostensibly with the purpose of acknowledging these victims instead denies the history of forced labor and even discrimination against Koreans at the inscribed sites .\nLike the Sado mines , five of the inscribed Meiji Industrial Sites with Korean forced labor history , including the infamous \u201c Battleship Island/Gunkanjima \u201d ( Hashima ) , were owned and operated by the Mitsubishi group during the war .\nPrevious examination of the nomination process and development of the controversial Industrial Heritage Information Centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and encouraged by Abe Shinz\u014d , and that his close friend Kato K\u014dko along with elite businesspeople within and/or with close ties to Mitsubishi were directly responsible for the data collection which formed the basis for the center \u2019 s exhibitions .\n[ 9 ] UNESCO has given Japan a deadline of December 1st 2022 to report updated steps to improve the historical narratives at the center .\nPushing for the World Heritage inscription of yet another industrial site with a history of wartime Korean forced labor naturally attracts unwanted attention in Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Korean media reports frequently refer to the Sado mines as \u201c the second Battleship Island.\n\u201d [ 10 ] Why nominate the Sado mines for World Heritage inscription when it attracts attention to a history Japan would like to forget ?\nBehind the World Heritage Nomination of the Sado Mines Sado Island is located in Niigata Prefecture about 30 km from the mainland and is roughly two thirds the size of Okinawa Island ( 855 km\u00b2 ) .\nThe population is approximately 56,000 ( as of 2018 ) .\n[ 11 ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the Sado mines were also domestically well-known before its World Heritage nomination .\nEven so , the number of visitors to Sado have steadily declined since the 1990 \u2019 s .\nWhile about 1,144,000 people travelled across to Sado in the fiscal year of 1994 , only about 500,000 people crossed over to the island annually in the fiscal years of 2019 and 2020 .\n[ 12 ] This number was further halved in 2021 by the Coronavirus pandemic .\nIn recent news reports broadcasted in Japan , people working in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high hopes and expectations for a World Heritage inscription that could revitalize tourism on the island .\nIn order for any country to nominate a site for World Heritage inscription , the site must first be included in the country \u2019 s Tentative List .\n[ 13 ] The first application to register the Sado mines was filed jointly by Sado City and Niigata Prefecture in 2006 .\n[ 14 ] This was the very first year it become possible for local governments to do so in Japan , as it had previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ 15 ] As the initial underdeveloped application failed , the prefectural government established an official Niigata World Heritage registration promotion office .\n\u201c The Sado complex of heritage mines , primarily gold mines \u201d was approved for the Tentative List by the Agency of Cultural Affairs in 2010 .\nThe focus was now on primarily on gold , in contrast to the first application which was titled \u201c Sado , the island of gold and silver : mining and culture.\n\u201d Over a period of about 400 years of mining , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and 78 tons of gold .\n[ 16 ] The approved application did not ignore Sado \u2019 s silver production , but goldmining was made central to the claim that the mines have Outstanding Universal Value ( OUV ) \u2014an essential criteria for World Heritage recognition .\nJapan \u2019 s claims for OUV of the Sado mines in 2010 included the culture that developed there for over 400 years of goldmining and \u201c the constant introduction of mining techniques and technical expertise from both Japan and abroad [ \u2026 ] .\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alluvial gold deposits and the D\u014dy\u016b-nowarito outcrop \u201d as \u201c outstanding example [ s ] of a technological ensemble.\n\u201d Emphasis is put on the Edo-period \u201c gold coinage system manufactured at the Sado Mines \u201d and the Sado mines \u2019 historical influence on international economy .\nValue of the Sado mines as Industrial Heritage The uniqueness of the Sado mines as an industrial heritage site can be disputed .\n[ 18 ] Japan \u2019 s interpretation of the mines \u2019 history is selective and celebratory , but arguably , the mines are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for future generations .\nIn 1601 , two years before the Tokugawa Shogunate started its 265 year long military rule of Japan ( the Edo-period ) , Tokugawa started developing the Sado Aikawa gold and silver mine .\nMiners from all over Japan gathered on Sado which became the biggest and most important gold and silver mines in the country .\nAlthough generally primitive , endogenous mining techniques developed on Sado .\n[ 19 ] The Sado mining community spawned unique cultural aspects , such as \u201c demon drums \u201d ( Onidaiko ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , locals with demon masks and mining chisels have danced to traditional taiko drums on Sado during festivals , a custom continued and highly valued to this day .\n[ 21 ] The Sado mines are also important heritage sites due to their iconic history of prison labor .\nIn his introduction to Japanese prison labor , Tanaka Mitsuo asserts that \u201c prison labor history [ in Japan ] is extensive , and the most famous example is the Sado mines , \u201d referring to the Edo-period .\n[ 22 ] Since 1778 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities were rounded up and transported to the Sado mines for slave labor .\nIllegal gambling rings were raided to catch groups of prisoners for mining .\nThe Japanese word \u201c dosakusa , \u201d meaning \u201c a confusing and chaotic situation , \u201d is said to stem from \u201c dosa \u201d \u2014Edo-period slang referring to illegal gamblers escaping in all directions and sent to the Sado mines ( \u201c do-sa \u201d is \u201c Sa-do \u201d spelt backwards in Japanese ) .\n[ 23 ] Records show that lung disease due to inhalation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edo-period Sado mine laborers .\n[ 24 ] Most of the prison laborers pumped water out of the mines which were susceptible to flooding , and it is estimated that 1,800 laborers died in the Sado mines in the last 100 years of the Edo-period .\n[ 25 ] At the beginning of the Meiji Era , the Meiji government took control of the mine .\nTo remedy decreased production , foreign mining experts from England , Germany and the US were brought to Sado to set up Western modernized mining facilities .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ advised the discontinuation of ineffective endogenous techniques , many of which had been developed by the miners themselves .\n[ 27 ] Mitsubishi purchased the Sado mines from the Meiji government in 1896 , which was excellent timing .\n[ 28 ] The demand for gold soared when Japan placed the Yen on the gold-standard in 1897 , meaning that the value of the Yen was based on a fixed amount of gold .\nThe background was that Japan mainly bought warships , munitions , and machinery from gold-standard countries like Britain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the global depreciation of silver .\nAfter the first Sino-Japanese war ( 1894-95 ) in which Japan gained power in Korea by defeating China , Japan received from China an indemnity in gold worth \u00a338 million British Pounds .\nWith this indemnity Japan obtained sufficient reserves to satisfy the Bank of England and to switch to the gold standard .\n[ 29 ] Mitsubishi \u2019 s Sado gold could then be exchanged for Western warships and weapons helping Japan win the Russo-Japanese War ( 1904-1905 ) .\nRussia \u2019 s defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Japanese Protectorate ( 1905-1910 ) and subsequently a colony of Japan ( 1910-1945 ) .\nBy 1897 , 2224 laborers at Mitsubishi \u2019 s Sado mines produced gold , silver , and copper .\n[ 30 ] The majority of workers were Japanese , recruited from outside Sado Island by contractors .\n[ 31 ] Rather than paying the laborers directly , Mitsubishi paid the contractors who provided food and dormitory ( takobeya ) space and became wealthy from deducting fees from their contracted workers \u2019 wages .\nAround the turn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mistreatment of contracted laborers after journalists worked undercover in their coal mines and exposed the lack of freedom of movement and violent punishments inflicted by overseers .\n[ 32 ] Also in the Sado mines , hundreds of miners launched disputes and strikes between 1899-1922 to protest unacceptable conditions .\n[ 33 ] From 1926 , a new system was implemented in the Sado mines in which laborers were directly employed and paid by Mitsubishi , but the previous system was not completely phased out until 1935 .\n[ 34 ] Mitsubishi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Sado mines on gold from 1931 when Japan instigated the second Sino-Japanese war .\nThe company group built new facilities to produce additional gold on Sado , in order to meet the government \u2019 s rising demands .\nJapan needed funding for the purchase and transport of military supplies to its forces invading China .\n[ 36 ] The Kitazawa Floating Plant , the only floating plant in East Asia at the time , was expanded for this purpose in 1938 .\n[ 37 ] The Kitazawa Floating Plant is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sado mine complex , and its image is frequently used to promote the Sado mines .\nSado \u2019 s most successful year in terms of gold production was 1940 when , in the midst of the Asia-Pacific War , 1537kg of gold were produced .\nThis was almost double that of 1938 , made possible with the use of Korean forced laborers whose massive mobilization was initiated in 1939 .\n[ 38 ] In 1952 , Mitsubishi closed many of the Sado mine tunnels and reduced the number of employees to one tenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company opened parts of the mines for commercial tourism .\nMining operations were closed permanently in 1989 , as minerals were deemed depleted .\nOwnership was passed to Golden Sado Inc. which to the present manages the mines for tourism .\nIn addition to an exhibition hall and outdoor industrial heritage , tourists can join tours inside mines including the Edo-period S\u014dday\u016b-tunnel and the Meiji-period D\u014dy\u016b-tunnel .\n[ 40 ] Golden Sado Inc. is a Mitsubishi subsidiary which is owned 100 % by the Mitsubishi Materials Corporation .\n[ 41 ] The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity for Mitsubishi itself , as the conglomerate can pocket increased revenues through the tourism boost a World Heritage inscription will facilitate without having to acknowledge the role of forced labor in the wartime mines .\nThe reason behind Japan \u2019 s insistence on inscribing yet another site of Korean forced labor for World Heritage now , is that local Sado Island tourism promotion has peaked at the same time that Japanese efforts to deny forced labor at \u201c Battleship Island \u201d and other Meiji Industrial Sites inscribed as World Heritage peaked since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress of Industrial Heritage ( managed by Kat\u014d ) has received great sums of money from the LDP government spent on the Industrial Heritage Information Centre ( also managed by Kat\u014d ) , which despite criticism from UNESCO continues to deny both Korean forced labor and discrimination against Koreans at the Meiji Industrial Heritage Sites .\nAs Abe has correctly implied , hesitating to nominate the Sado mines could send a signal that Japan acknowledges the need to scrutinize its wartime forced labor history .\nAt the same time , Mitsubishi is facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced labor at a multitude of the company \u2019 s sites across Japan .\nThe fact that Mitsubishi itself is still deeply involved with both the Meiji Industrial Sites and the Sado mines is one reason that acknowledging forced labor history is not considered an option by Japan .\nIn the case of the Meiji Industrial Sites , testimony from many Korean and Chinese victims as well as from Western POWs are known .\nIn the case of the Sado mines , there are no known foreign victims except Koreans , and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor in the Sado mines is known .\nJapan may not perceive the Sado mines nomination as posing any new problems\u2014it may only exacerbate already tense Japan-Korea relations .\nHowever , Japan is wrong to assume that only Koreans value the memories of Korean victims .\nIm T \u2019 aeho \u2019 s Memories of Forced Labor in the Sado Mines The aforementioned single Korean testimony was given by Im T \u2019 aeho ( \uc784\ud0dc\ud638/\u6797\u6cf0\u934b ) in May 1997 , a few months before he passed away .\nHis oral testimony was recorded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and published in Japan in 2002 .\n[ 43 ] Recent interviews with Im Ky\u014fngsuk and Im T \u2019 aeho \u2019 s oldest daughter , Im Kanran , provide new details not recorded in his testimony .\n[ 44 ] Im Ky\u014fngsuk and Im Kanran with pictures of their father , Im T \u2019 aeho .\nPicture captured from the Chosun Ilbo website , 20 Jan. 2022 .\nIm T \u2019 aeho was born December 20th 1919 in Nonsan , Korea , where he married and lived until recruiters working for Mitsubishi came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s wife gave birth to their first daughter Im Kanran in Nonsan the same year .\nNonsan was impoverished and Im T \u2019 aeho could not find work there to support his new family .\nHe was enticed by the promises of the recruiters and saw no other option but to relocate his family to Japan where family housing , food , and work was guaranteed by Mitsubishi .\n20-year-old Im T \u2019 aeho crossed the ocean first on a narrow boat crammed full of others like him , and his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sado Island in November 1940 , Im T \u2019 aeho was taken deep into the mountains of Aikawa .\nFar from a comfortable family apartment , he was placed in a remote and crammed dormitory ( hamba ) .\nHis testimony states he realized that he would be mining minerals for Mitsubishi in the Sado mines and that he had lost his freedom .\nHis wife and infant daughter also lived in the dormitory together with many other miners .\nIm T \u2019 aeho \u2019 s wife gave birth to two more daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aeho worked every day from morning until night , mining for minerals deep inside the dusty mines .\nHe stated that cave-ins happened almost every day and that remains of Koreans who died were not treated with any respect by Mitsubishi .\nThis heightened his constant death anxiety .\nThe approximately 90-minute walk back from the mines to the dormitory at night were excruciating .\nIt was a difficult and mountainous path with heavy snowfall in winter , reaching high above Im T \u2019 aeho \u2019 s knees .\nIm T \u2019 aeho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mines .\nThe first time , a ladder inside the mines fell as he was climbing it , causing permanent injuries to his hip and leg .\nIm T \u2019 aeho regained consciousness after being carried back to the dormitory\u2014not the hospital .\nAccording to his testimony , he was not offered any treatment and was unable to walk to the hospital himself .\nHe was forced back into the mines as soon as he could stand up after about ten days in the dormitory .\nSoon after , he sustained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that point , he realized that he could not survive the rigors of the labor much longer .\nIm T \u2019 aeho managed to escape from Sado Island with his wife and three young daughters .\n[ 45 ] Korean forced laborers only received a fraction of their promised wages , and Im T \u2019 aeho had no money after the escape .\nIm and his family wandered around Japan , and were in Kawasaki when the war ended in August 1945 .\nHe was emotionally overwhelmed and could only shed tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea had been liberated and he was freed from the chains of imperial Japan .\nDespite suffering from trauma , mining injuries and silicosis , Im T \u2019 aeho lived until the age of 77 .\nSilicosis is a lung decease caused by prolonged inhalation of mineral dust ( silica ) that makes it progressively harder to breath , decades after first exposure .\n[ 46 ] According to his daughter Im Ky\u014fngsuk , Im T \u2019 aeho developed lumps in his lungs the size of marbles , which eventually caused his slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated hope of someday receiving an apology from Japan was futile .\nIm T \u2019 aeho \u2019 s children oppose the World Heritage nomination of the Sado mines because Japan selectively presents celebratory narratives while concealing shameful parts of history , including the story of their father .\nHistorical documents and previous research prove that Mitsubishi used Korean forced laborers at the Sado mines during wartime .\nAn extensive Korean investigation report on Mitsubishi \u2019 s wartime forced labor in the Sado mines from 2019 , headed by Ch\u014fng Hyeky\u014fng for the Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan , confirms this history building on multiple primary and secondary sources .\n[ 47 ] These include Japanese colonial police reports , newspapers , name lists , interviews with seven families of deceased victims , as well as earlier Japanese academic investigations .\n[ 48 ] One of the latter is Hirose Teiz\u014d \u2019 s research conducted in the 1980 \u2019 s .\n[ 49 ] Hirose , a local historian at Niigata University fluent in Korean , has interviewed both elderly local Sado residents as well as Korean victims of forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 ] Official Japanese local history books from Sado City and Niigata Prefecture also describe Korean forced labor in the Sado mines .\n[ 51 ] Numerous publications document Korean forced labor at other Mitsubishi sites , adding context for interpreting the case of the Sado Mines .\n[ 52 ] Korean laborers already worked in the Sado mines before forced mobilization and forced labor programs for Koreans were initiated by the Japanese government in 1939 .\nFollowing Japan \u2019 s annexation of Korea in 1910 , the number of Koreans in Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of Niigata Prefecture was 11 in 1913 , climbing to 1,061 in 1927 , reaching 3,368 by 1938 .\n[ 53 ] By 1929 , 21 Koreans had accepted work in the Sado mines under employment by Mitsubishi .\n[ 54 ] Although life in Japan was not easy , some of the Korean families that lived on Sado Island in the 1930 \u2019 s before the war saw the work as an opportunity .\n[ 55 ] Koreans were citizens of the Japanese empire .\nHowever , xenophobia and racism against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korean forced labor became common during wartime ( from 1939 ) as numerous Japanese laborers were drafted into the military .\nThe independence movement , which began in Korea on March 1st 1919 , provoked anti-Korean sentiment in Japan .\nOn July 29th 1922 , the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported that a great number of \u201c corpses of massacred Koreans \u201d were floating down the Shinano river in Niigata .\n[ 56 ] The background was the Shinano river incident , in which up to 100 Korean laborers at the Nakatsu Power Plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electric Power ( currently Tokyo Electric Power Company ) were massacred for attempting escape .\n[ 57 ] Forced labor and violent exploitation of Korean laborers was not common in Japan at this time , but according to the newspaper article , Korean laborers at the Niigata Nakatsu Power Plant were forced to work 16 hours a day by Japanese supervisors .\n[ 58 ] It is noteworthy that both the Niigata and Tokyo police denied that any massacre of Koreans had taken place , and media coverage immediately ceased .\nLocals subsequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Korean corpses , a fact included in Niigata \u2019 s official history .\n[ 59 ] After the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake , false reports of Koreans using the aftermath as an opportunity to plunder Japanese villages continued to be spread by newspapers , despite lack of evidence .\n[ 60 ] In Niigata , groups of Japanese vigilantes were guarding villages with dynamite in hand , terrified of what even the official prefectural history subsequently confirmed were \u201c hoaxes \u201d against Korean residents .\n[ 61 ] In imperial Japan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese .\nMitsubishi was struggling with labor shortages in the Sado mines when the Japanese government in 1938 implemented regulations for increased production of minerals to support the war against China .\n[ 62 ] Japan \u2019 s National General Labor Mobilization Law , implemented in 1938 , was adjusted the next year allowing Japanese companies to mobilize laborers from Korea with the aid of colonial police and authorities .\n[ 63 ] This wartime mobilization of Korean laborers officially started in September 1939 , but Mitsubishi started mass recruitment from Korea to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMitsubishi \u2019 s Human Resources staff explained that \u201c production targets [ could ] not be met because many of the Japanese laborers working inside the mine [ were ] suffering from silicosis , and more and more young Japanese [ were ] conscripted for military service \u201d .\n[ 64 ] No known records show how many Sado mine laborers suffered from silicosis , but a Taish\u014d-era ( 1912-1926 ) name list for the Yasuda dormitory noted 10 \u201c suspicious deaths , \u201d 2 deaths due to suffocation , and 122 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 65 ] From February 1939 , Mitsubishi \u2019 s recruiters for the Sado mines travelled around villages in Korea \u2019 s South Ch \u2019 ungch \u2019 \u014fng Province , where Im T \u2019 aeho \u2019 s hometown of Nonsan is located .\nUp to 40 men from each village were made to sign three-year working contracts for labor in Japan .\n[ 66 ] Deception and coercion was common during the recruitment process , and force was used to keep laborers at work against their will .\n[ 67 ] In addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kang Sinto , Kim Chongw\u014fn , and Hong Tongch \u2019 \u014fl were taken from Nonsan to the Sado mines by Mitsubishi with support from the Japanese government during wartime .\nThe aforementioned 2019 Korean investigation report , based on interviews with their families , explained that the latter three were sent back to Korea with silicosis in 1943 .\n[ 68 ] Kang Sinto , Kim Chongw\u014fn , and Hong Tongch \u2019 \u014fl all received disability-related financial support from the Korean government until their deaths due to their fatal decease .\n[ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sado City World Heritage Promotional Division gives a few more details on the February 1939 mobilization of Korean laborers for the Sado mines , based on Mitsubishi \u2019 s records .\n[ 70 ] It states that drought had continued for two years in a row in South Ch \u2019 ungch \u2019 \u014fng Province , and suggests that this made it easy to recruit a large ( unspecified ) number of Korean workers .\nIt further states that many Koreans \u201c escaped \u201d in Japan on the way to Sado Island because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from acquaintances already in Japan \u201d .\nHowever , as we know from the context , these exploited Koreans were escaping their forced mobilization .\nThe forced mobilization of Korean laborers to Japan officially went through three different phases\u2014 \u201c recruitment \u201d ( Sep. 1939-Feb. 1942 ) , \u201c official mediation \u201d ( until Sep. 1944 ) , and \u201c conscription \u201d ( until Aug .\n1945 ) .\n[ 71 ] It is well-known that despite misleading terms , all three periods were planned by the Japanese state and involved coercion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNiigata \u2019 s official history also asserts for the same reasons that \u201c the fact that Koreans were mobilized with force \u201d applies to all three phases .\n[ 72 ] During the \u201c recruitment \u201d period , the threat of violence was used by recruiters who worked with Korean officials .\nDuring the \u201c official mediation \u201d period , the Korean Labor Association handled recruitment on behalf of Japanese companies , using coercion to meet the Japanese government \u2019 s demands .\nOnce contracts were signed by the often illiterate Korean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of work where they lost freedom of movement .\nDuring the \u201c conscription \u201d period , Japanese military police openly used violence against Koreans who had no legal way to avoid recruitment .\n[ 73 ] When the first three-year contracts were about to end in 1942 , Sado labor managers implemented a policy to make \u201c everyone continue working.\n\u201d [ 74 ] Mitsubishi \u2019 s records noted that local authorities and police in Korea should be consulted before sending back those that were too sick , or for other reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ 75 ] The official history of Niigata prefecture states that the contracts were renewed by force .\n[ 76 ] In February 1944 , Mitsubishi built a sanatorium especially for Korean laborers , for the purpose of providing \u201c early treatment of disease and ideological training.\n\u201d [ 77 ] Rather than sending laborers back to Korea , symptoms of silicosis could sometimes be eased with medical treatment and \u201c ideological training \u201d could motivate , or force , sick Korean laborers to return to the mines .\nIn December 1944 , @ @ @ @ @

during wartime is usually not legally considered forced labor , South Korea asserts that Japan \u2019 s colonial occupation of Korea was illegal and against the will of its people , and therefore the conscription of Koreans as subjects of colonial Japan was also illegal .\n[ 79 ] Takeuchi Yasuto is widely cited for his statistics and calculations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan , based on primary sources .\nHe estimates that out of the approximately 800,000 Koreans forced to work in Japan during wartime , more than 100,000 worked for Mitsubishi .\n[ 80 ] Mitsubishi also used wartime foreign forced labor in mines and factories outside the Japanese mainland , in countries like Korea , China , Singapore , Malaysia , Thailand , Indonesia and the Philippines .\n[ 81 ] In addition to its many famous factories and coalmines located throughout the empire , Mitsubishi used Korean forced labor for mineral mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sado mines , Ikuno mines , Akenobe mines , Osarizawa mines , Obira mines , Makine mines , Hosokura mines , Teine mines , and Shin-Shimokawa mines .\n[ 82 ] These mineral mines benefitted from the slave labor of approximately 60,000 Koreans .\n[ 83 ] About 5,000 Korean forced laborers were working in 40 different sites in Niigata Prefecture when the war ended\u2014the Sado mines having the highest ratio .\n[ 84 ] Takeuchi calculates that in the Sado mines specifically , at least 1,519 Koreans were forced to work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the war .\n[ 85 ] This number is based on Mitsubishi \u2019 s own records , but may not include all Koreans mobilized between February 1939 and February 1940 for which period no detailed records are known .\nMitsubishi documented its mobilization of a total of 1,005 Korean laborers for the Sado mines between February 1940 and March 1942 , of which 584 were still there in June 1943 ( together with 709 Japanese ) .\n[ 86 ] New recruits were needed as the Korean labor force was continuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also a large number of escapes and possibly unrecorded deaths .\nMitsubishi \u2019 s own statistics from 1943 record 148 successful escapes ( \u9003\u8d70 ) of Korean laborers between February 1940 and June 1943 .\n[ 87 ] Mitsubishi recorded that for the same period 6 Koreans were sent home due to working injuries , and 30 more due to \u201c personal illness \u201d .\n130 were transferred to other labor sites .\nThe same statistics record 10 deaths of Korean laborers during this period .\nHowever , the Korean investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least two deaths during this period were not recorded by Mitsubishi and suggests there may be many more .\nThe two unrecorded deaths specifically referred to in this Korean report occurred on December 20th 1942 , when falling rocks inside the mines fractured the skull of Kim Chuhwan , killing him along with another unnamed Korean laborer .\n[ 88 ] Today , the names of over 500 Korean forced laborers at the Sado mines are known from a combination of name lists , including notes of distribution of tobacco rations which also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 89 ] The 2019 Korean investigation report calculates , based on a combined list of 355 names and ages of Korean forced laborers at the Sado mines , that the average age was 28.8 .\n[ 90 ] The ages ranged from 16 to 48 , and 53 % were in their twenties .\nMitsubishi \u2019 s aforementioned records of Korean laborers recruited between February 1940 and March 1942 documents that 80 % were from South Ch \u2019 ungch \u2019 \u014fng Province ( including Nonsan ) and 20 % from North Ch\u014flla Province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 91 ] However , other sources such as the tobacco ration list inform us that the Sado mines also recruited Koreans from South Ch\u014flla Province , North Ky\u014fngsang Province and North Ch \u2019 ungch \u2019 \u014fng Province in the south , as well as from South Hamgy\u014fng Province which today is part of North Korea .\n[ 92 ] Korean forced laborers are known to have been placed in at least five different residences on Sado Island .\nThese were Yamanogami company residence ( for families ) in Shimoyamagami-machi , S\u014dai Dormitory no.1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suwa-ch\u014d , S\u014dai Dormitory no.4 in Chisuke-machi and a final dormitory referred to as K\u016dmgangnyo in the 2019 Korean investigation report ( possibly \u201c Kanagawa \u201d Dormitory in Japanese ) .\n[ 93 ] Mitsubishi \u2019 s records listed 117 Korean laborers residing in the company residence for families , and 185 , 157 , and 124 Koreans residing in S\u014dai Dormitory No .\n1 , 3 and 4 , respectively .\n[ 94 ] According to the 2015 survey report by the Sado City World Heritage Promotional Division , Korean laborers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shimoyamagami-machi as well as in houses in Shimoaikawa .\n[ 95 ] According to Sakaue Torakichi who worked as a dormitory chief for Koreans on Sado during wartime , each person was allocated the space of one tatami mat ( less than 2 m\u00b2 ) .\n[ 96 ] Citing an April 14th 1941 Niigata Shimbun newspaper article , Hirose Teiz\u014d states that , in 1941 , about 50 out of 600 Korean laborers on Sado lived in family apartments .\nHowever , the 2019 Korean report which included findings of investigations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceased Korean forced laborers lived in dormitories with other laborers on Sado island .\n[ 97 ] It is unclear why Mitsubishi placed several families from Nonsan in dormitories despite having family apartments on Sado , but this discovery is significant for corroborating Im T \u2019 aeho \u2019 s testimony .\nMitsubishi \u2019 s laborers did not pay for housing on Sado Island , but amongst various compulsory fees 50 zen was deducted daily for food prepared by the company , yet food was in short supply .\n[ 98 ] Lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korean laborers attempting to escape Sado Island .\n[ 99 ] The Niigata Shimbun newspaper reported on April 8 1942 , that hundreds of \u201c Koreans and others \u201d employed at Mitsubishi \u2019 s Sado mines were cultivating large amounts of vegetables in the Aikawa mountain fields , while also raising several pigs to provide fertilizer to secure sufficient food .\n[ 100 ] Mitsubishi \u2019 s records list vegetable and pig farming as a countermeasure for food shortage , suggesting that the vegetable fields referred to in the newspaper article were managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korean laborers at the Sado mines were constantly reminded how their work supported Japanese warfare .\nMitsubishi \u2019 s main gates on Sado bore the slogan : \u201c Final victory will be achieved from exceeding production targets day by day ; increase production with indomitable fighting spirit ( \u6226\u610f ) ; destroy USA and England with labor and accident-prevention.\n\u201d [ 102 ] Japanese students lined up in the morning greeting laborers on the way to the mines : \u201c Good morning everyone [ ! ]\nPlease increase production today as well so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the USA and England.\n\u201d [ 103 ] The week after Japan \u2019 s attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th 1941 , a \u201c prayer festival for the war victory of migrant Korean laborers \u201d was held at a Shinto shrine near the Sado mines , in which about 200 Koreans were made to pray and worship the Japanese emperor .\n[ 104 ] Newly arrived Korean laborers at the Sado mines received three months of language education and ideological training .\n[ 105 ] Many of the Korean farmers selected for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contrast to the coal mines , comprehension of instructions was essential in the mineral mines .\nThe ideological training was also spiritual or religious in nature .\nA central part of the \u201c Japanification \u201d of Koreans was Shintoism and worship of the Japanese emperor as a descendant of Shinto deities .\nThe fact that such training continued even in the Korean sanatorium illustrates the extent of proselytism .\nKorean resistance to Shintoism is evident in the fact that large groups of Koreans tore down the Japanese shrines in their country very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Sado mines faced extreme discrimination with potentially fatal outcomes .\nThe majority of the toughest and most dangerous positions deep in the mines , where cave-ins were common and constant inhalation of silica dust was unavoidable , were filled by Koreans .\n[ 106 ] Records of most cave-ins are not available , but a 1935 Niigata Shimbun newspaper article states that on average one laborer per day was injured from accidents in the Sado mines , which is consistent with Im T \u2019 aeho \u2019 s memories of wartime labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s prefectural history documents , job assignments at the Sado mines were discriminatory towards Koreans .\n[ 108 ] Underground rock drilling , tunnel underpinning , and underground transporting of produced minerals were especially dangerous jobs .\n[ 109 ] According to the Mitsubishi report from June 1943 , 76 % of laborers assigned to these positions were Korean ( 146 Japanese versus 473 Koreans ) .\n[ 110 ] 82 % of rock drillers were Korean ( 27 Japanese versus 123 Koreans ) .\nOnly 18 % of smelters , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Korean ( 85 Japanese versus 19 Koreans ) .\nSome of Mitsubishi \u2019 s job categories are vague , such as those of k\u014dsaku ( possible interpretations include craftsmen and machinists ) and zatsufu/z\u014dfu ( helper , or literally someone who does various jobs ) .\nOnly 26 % of laborers assigned these positions were Korean ( 69 Japanese versus 24 Koreans ) .\nThe only assignment outside the mines which had a majority of Korean laborers was outside mineral transportation ( 17 Japanese versus 49 Koreans ) .\nThere was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which 321 Japanese and no Koreans were assigned .\nHirose Teiz\u014d suggests this may refer to female mineral separators working outside the mines .\n[ 111 ] There was no category for farming .\nLaborers were divided into three work shifts of officially 7-9 hours : 6am to 3pm , 2:30pm to 11pm , and 11pm to 6am .\n[ 112 ] However , a Niigata Shimbun journalist who experienced working in the Torigoe-tunnel of the Sado mines reported that the majority of miners had to work overtime , making each shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] The distance between dormitories and working stations could potentially add hours of walking and/or hiking to the daily schedule .\nIn the month of July 1941 , Sado mine laborers worked an average of 28 days .\n[ 114 ] Mitsubishi \u2019 s record of job assignments for Korean and Japanese laborers in the Sado mines , June 1943 .\nIn principle , wages of Korean forced laborers were equal to that of Japanese employees .\nThis was not actually the case , however , due to skewed job assignments with varying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Korean wages being withheld during and after Japan \u2019 s defeat .\nWages were calculated based on each laborer \u2019 s quotas varying by job assignments .\n[ 115 ] Regardless of wage levels , deductions were made for food and working gear including clothing and tools .\n[ 116 ] Deductions continued even during food shortages that forced Korean laborers to farm and pay for extra rice to supplement their miniscule rations .\n[ 117 ] Calculations of average monthly wages for wartime Korean forced laborers in the Sado mines range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 118 ] However , only a fraction of these wages were paid because discriminatory deductions were applied exclusively to Koreans .\nSado City \u2019 s World Heritage promotional report states that \u201c for the purpose of life improvement , \u201d Korean laborers were \u201c prohibited from wasting their money.\n\u201d [ 119 ] In order to prevent Korean laborers from accumulating cash , parts of their wages were put into compulsory national saving schemes .\n[ 120 ] Parts of Korean wages were also sent to Korea , possibly to prevent escapes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other times reaching laborers \u2019 relatives .\n[ 121 ] At the end of the Asia-Pacific War in August 1945 , Mitsubishi held a total of 231,059.56 yen in salaries and severance pay for 1,141 Korean forced laborers at the Sado mines , on average 203 yen per worker .\n[ 122 ] Rather than transferring these wages to the workers , in 1949 Mitsubishi deposited them with Niigata Prefecture .\nAfter ten years , these Korean funds passed to the Japanese government .\n[ 123 ] No outstanding salaries for Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea stipulates that unpaid wartime salaries can no longer be requested by South Koreans .\nJapan is still legally required to pay forced laborers from today \u2019 s North Korea , but there is no evidence that Japan recognizes any such obligation or that it has provided the funds .\nThe large number of Korean escapes ( 148 out of 1,005 ) from the Sado mines underlines their lack of freedom .\nThere were also large numbers of strikes for reasons including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ 124 ] One of Mitsubishi \u2019 s wartime labor managers on Sado commented that strikes also occurred due to the \u201c extreme racism \u201d of some of the Japanese managers .\n[ 125 ] According to the records of Niigata prefecture , the Japanese managers did not hide their view of Koreans as racially inferior .\n[ 126 ] They said that strikes occurred because the \u201c intelligence level of Koreans ( \u77e5\u80fd\u7a0b\u5ea6 ) \u201d was lower than first estimated , pointing out \u201c a unique Korean deviousness ( \u534a\u5cf6\u4eba\u7279\u6709\u306e\u72e1\u733e\u6027 ) \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without personal judgement ( \u4ed8\u548c\u96f7\u540c\u6027 ) .\n\u201d [ 127 ] Mitsubishi did not improve the conditions of Korean forced laborers to reduce strikes and escapes .\nInstead , the company decided to strengthen ties with local police , reduce sympathy for Korean laborers and punish those who helped them escape .\n[ 128 ] When Koreans escapees were caught , they were sent to a police station for interrogation , sometimes fined , and returned to Mitsubishi .\n[ 129 ] According to Sakaue Torakichi , the Mitsubishi dormitory boss , policemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n[ 130 ] In order to center all mining efforts on copper , which was needed in large amounts for weapons and munitions , the Japanese government closed all goldmines in the country that did not also produce copper from April 1943 .\nIn 1944 Mitsubishi produced 890 tons of copper compared with 531kg of gold .\n[ 131 ] As the shift to copper made the Sado mines \u2019 labor force excessive , 408 Korean forced laborers were transferred to underground military construction sites in Saitama and Fukushima prefectures in 1945 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on August 15 , 1945 , Korean forced laborers knew that they would soon be free .\nMitsubishi \u2019 s Sado mine managers , however , held a meeting the next day with the Sado Aikawa chief of police to prevent the loss of Korean laborers .\n[ 133 ] Mitsubishi recorded another seven Korean escapes between August 15th and September 11th .\n[ 134 ] Korean laborers refused to continue mining , and Mitsubishi responded by blocking their access to food .\nAt that point , some 40 Koreans broke into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 135 ] Korean forced laborers on Sado island were finally returned to Korea in the period from October to December 1945\u2014the last returns from Niigata Prefecture .\n[ 136 ] Japan often argues that because wartime Korean laborers received wages , they can not be classified as forced laborers .\nThis constitutes denial of the actual conditions and circumstances of wartime Korean labor .\n[ 137 ] Japan has a long history of various forms of slave labor .\nFor example , prison laborers received wages even as they were required to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for food .\nFor example , Meiji Era prison laborers in the coalmines received wages equivalent on average to 25 % of a contracted miner .\n[ 138 ] Koreans forced to work in the Sado mines during wartime were also waged , but they did not receive the amounts promised , nor could they spend their money freely .\nWages were used as a means of control with payments deducted for their equipment and food .\nMost important , as documented earlier , Mitsubishi retained much of the wages they had earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even after Japan \u2019 s surrender and their return to Korea .\nIt is true that the system which allowed forced laborers to live with non-working family members is different from traditional chattel slavery , but it was still a system for forced labor .\nIn order to feed and protect their families , forced laborers , like Im T \u2019 aeho , had to follow orders or risk their families \u2019 safety by attempting dangerous escapes .\nThe problem remains that the most influential historical narratives describing Japan \u2019 s industrial heritage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and politicians , rather than historians .\n[ 139 ] The International Labor Organization \u2019 s ( ILO ) Forced Labor Convention of 1930 , ratified by Japan , defines forced labor as \u201c all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily.\n\u201d [ 140 ] Article 2 makes an exception for emergencies like war in which the labor is necessary not to \u201c endanger the existence or the well-being of the whole or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no legal basis for forcing hundreds of thousands of Koreans to work in Japan under abysmal conditions that condemned many to death .\nThe ILO \u201c considers that the massive conscription of labour to work for private industry in Japan under such deplorable conditions was a violation of the [ 1930 Forced Labor ] Convention.\n\u201d [ 141 ] Systems of forced labor are not necessarily identical to those of chattel slavery .\nKoreans working in Mitsubishi \u2019 s Sado mines and elsewhere during wartime were abused as forced laborers under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations such as Mitsubishi with support of the Japanese state .\nRecognition of the true character of this history would greatly elevate the universal value of the Sado mines as a UNESCO World Heritage site .\nThey can not be suppressed for the sake of instilling pride in future Japanese generations to the neglect of the victims .\n\u201c Sado is filled with every sort of story of people seeking gold .\nWe want to tell their unwritten stories to the future .\nThat is the ultimate goal of seeking World Heritage [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The above is a quote from June 2016 by Hamano Hiroshi , Sado City instructor of Niigata Prefecture \u2019 s World Heritage Promotion Section , from the prefecture \u2019 s official video about the modern history of the Sado mines .\nThe narrator of the same video states that the \u201c start of the Showa-era was to become the most prosperous period ever for Sado mine , \u201d and that \u201c the creativity and inventiveness of many people \u201d lies behind the mines \u2019 great success .\nNeither the war nor the plight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast , in 1996 Sado Island tour guides described the Sado mines as \u201c a hell of cold and damp where half-starved prisoners picked , shoveled , and clawed gold ore from the walls of freezing rock galleries until they shivered to death from pneumonia.\n\u201d [ 143 ] Even the Edo period narratives of prison labor are now presented in the form of celebratory narratives of superior goldmining techniques .\n[ 144 ] It appears that as a potential World Heritage inscription draws nearer , more and more stories of \u201c people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten .\nThe Japanese government has implied that the Sado mines \u2019 nomination will be limited to the Edo period .\n[ 145 ] The nomination , filed February 1st 2022 , has not at this writing been made public .\nIt is likely to state that the Outstanding Universal Value of the mines comes from Edo-period innovations and events .\nThis way , Mitsubishi and its Korean forced laborers could be completely omitted from the narrative .\nUNESCO , however , did not accept Japan \u2019 s proposed limited historical range for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full story should be told .\nThe Sado mines nomination is likely to follow the same pattern .\nFor the Sado mines to become World Heritage in 2023 , 14 out of 21 UNESCO World Heritage Committee member countries must support its inscription .\nPrior to the inscription of the Meiji Industrial Sites , Korean and Japanese representatives travelled around the world to convince committee member countries of their respective historical interpretations .\n[ 146 ] With the Sado nomination , Japan is again using UNESCO as an international battlefield for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convince other countries to legitimize its benign interpretation of the history of the mine and Korean forced labor .\nSince the 2015 Meiji Industrial Sites \u2019 World Heritage inscription , Japan has broken its promise to tell the stories of Korean victims .\nIt similarly effectively blocked Korea \u2019 s registration of \u201c Voices of the \u2018 Comfort Women \u2019 \u201d in the UNESCO Memory of the World Program , insisting that victims of Japan \u2019 s military system of sexual slavery were professional prostitutes .\n[ 147 ] In terms of heritage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation .\nJapan \u2019 s \u201c history war \u201d has entered the global arena and threatens the spirit of UNESCO .\nUNESCO should not accept Japan \u2019 s World Heritage nomination for the Sado mines unless Japan pledges to provide

.\nToday , the dangers of military escalation are beyond description .\nWhat is now happening in Ukraine has serious geopolitical implications .\nIt could lead us into a World War III scenario .\nIt is important that a peace process be initiated with a view to preventing escalation .\nAfter Europe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s \u201c neutral \u201d attitude in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine , netizens from India quickly put those two tags on the top of the Indian list .\nFor many Indian netizens , Russia is the \u201c biggest ally \u201d of India while Indians should support their old friend Putin , who is rebelling against the West , and maintain diplomatic and defense relations with Russia .\nBut for the Modi government , supporting Russia is not an easy decision .\nAs a frequent non-permanent member of the United Nations Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner that the US and Russia have been competing for over the years .\nIts attitude is extremely critical to both parties .\nAlthough India \u2019 s attitude remained generally neutral , there were some changes before and after the Ukraine conflict .\nSpecifically , before the conflict , India \u2019 s attitude was relatively detached , and it tried its best to avoid discussions on relevant issues .\nOn January 19 , US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman called Indian Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla to discuss the Russia-Ukraine issue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut India abstained from voting on the UN Security Council resolution on the Ukraine-Russia issue on January 29 .\nFile photo shows an earlier confab : : Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla held consultations with US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman on October 7 , 2021 .\nImage : @ DeputySecState/Twitter India \u2019 s permanent ambassador to the UN Security Council , TS Tirumurti , stressed at the meeting on Ukraine that , taking into account the legitimate security interests of all countries , it is best for all parties to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jointly ensure long-term peace and stability in the region .\nAt the following QUAD foreign ministers \u2019 meeting , India also became the only member state that did not criticize Russia \u2019 s position .\nThere was no statement concerning the Russia-Ukraine issue in the joint statement of the meeting .\nAll these words and deeds showed that India was trying to stay neutral on the issue and avoid provoking Russia and the US .\nHowever , India \u2019 s position avoided the relevant issues on Russia .\nAt that time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Project at the Brookings Institution , said India would be trapped in diplomatic passivity if Moscow started taking military action against Ukraine : First , China and Russia would form a closer tie , threatening the situation around India .\nSecond , the intensified conflict between the US and Russia would create huge pressure on India-Russia relations and make it difficult for India to maintain a balance .\nThe third would be the weakening of the anti-China alliance .\nThe US and the West would seek to improve their relations with China amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trend would weaken India \u2019 s ability to seek international allies against China .\nAfter Russia started its military action against Ukraine , India still tried to stay neutral but more subtly .\nOn the one hand , the US and Ukraine repeatedly demanded support from India .\nOn February 24 , Ukraine \u2019 s ambassador to India , Igor Polikha , \u201c demanded and earnestly requested \u201d India \u2019 s support .\nUS President Joe Biden also said the US and India were still discussing an alignment on the Ukraine-Russia crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On February 26 , it abstained for the second time in a vote at the United Nations on a US-sponsored resolution condemning Russia .\nOn February 27 , it abstained for the third time when the United Nations Security Council voted on a resolution calling for a rare emergency special session to discuss Russia \u2019 s \u201c aggression \u201d in Ukraine .\nThese abstentions have fully demonstrated India \u2019 s neutral attitude between the US and Russia .\nOn the other hand , shortly after learning that Putin approved the march on Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Narendra Modi called Putin on the phone and called on Russia to immediately stop the violence .\nModi emphasized that only through honest and sincere dialogue could the differences between Russia and NATO be resolved .\nAt the same time , India also began to provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine .\nAccording to Indian media reports , on March 2 Foreign Secretary Shringla said at a press conference about the \u201c Operation Ganges \u201d evacuation from Ukraine that India had sent two batches of humanitarian relief supplies to Ukraine through Poland to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons of supplies reportedly included medicine , blankets , tents , tarpaulins , goggles , water storage tanks , sleeping pads , and surgical gloves .\nPolikha thanked India for providing aid to Ukraine .\nBut since then , India has faced a dilemma in its relations with both the US and Russia .\nIndia \u2019 s neutral stance in the United Nations has drawn criticism from the US and Ukraine .\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201c urged \u201d India to give political support in the UN Security Council .\nAt a press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Price reiterated that the Biden administration \u201c requested \u201d all countries to constructively exert influence on Russia .\nBefore the Security Council vote , India had been repeatedly lobbied by the US and Ukraine and warned of some serious consequences .\nThe US government was reportedly considering whether to impose sanctions on India under the Countering America \u2019 s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act ( CAATSA ) because India had previously purchased the S-400 missile air defense system from Russia .\nHowever , India still stood firm , sticking to its neutrality while offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations here : The first is the practical consideration of India \u2019 s balanced diplomacy .\nIndia maintains an important partnership with the US to compete with China in the Asia-Pacific region , but it also has a traditional strategic relationship with Russia .\nIndia sources 60 % of its defense equipment from Russia , and it also has many areas of high-tech cooperation with Russia , including nuclear energy , space and the joint production of certain weapons systems , such as BrahMos missiles .\nHence , India has always sought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Russia without having to take sides , even though the developments in Ukraine have made it more complicated for India to continue navigating between the two powers .\nIn addition , the Russia-Ukraine conflict will probably put the US in a difficult position in Europe in the context of the long-standing hostility in Sino-Indian relations .\nThis would force the US to shift its focus from the Indo-Pacific region to Europe and hurt India \u2019 s security interests in the long run .\nTherefore , India must take a more nuanced stance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s sovereignty and territorial integrity while emphasizing and supporting Russia \u2019 s security concerns .\nThe second consideration is India \u2019 s relative confidence in its economic importance .\nSome Indian elites believe that the West must rely on India in many ways due to the country \u2019 s huge population , broad market prospects and advantageous geographical location .\nGlobal businesses want to sell their products and services in India , and the US military-industrial complex also wants to tap into such a huge market as India .\nFor the western countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic partner , India is also an irreplaceable strategic partner .\nThe Modi government wants Washington \u2019 s elites to understand the calculations and the trade-offs that India faces .\nAs the struggle between great powers intensifies and the international political environment becomes more volatile , the US needs to increase its attention to Europe and further strengthen its cooperation with India in the Indo-Pacific region .\nThus , the Modi government believes that it will not have to pay a real price for its wait-and-see approach to Russia .\nThe third consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evacuate its citizens from Ukraine .\nSince some time ago , the evacuation of overseas Indians has become a very important \u201c show \u201d for the Modi government \u2019 s diplomatic work .\nFrom the evacuation of Indian nationals from Yemen in 2015 to the \u201c Vande Bharat \u201d operation during the pandemic in 2020 , the so-called largest evacuation in history , the Modi government has paid more and more attention to demonstrating to the Indian people its concern for their overseas compatriots , as well as the execution capability and responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Modi government can not afford to lose any ground in the important elections in Uttar Pradesh between February 10 and March 7 .\nIt will not pass up any opportunity to show its achievements , and the opposition parties will not let pass any mistakes that might weaken the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party .\nThere are 20,000 Indians in Ukraine , including more than 18,000 students .\nAfter the conflict broke out , Modi asked Putin to ensure the safety of international students in Ukraine , held special meetings for three consecutive days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior minister-level officials to the front to take charge of related work .\nOn March 1 , India \u2019 s Ministry of External Affairs confirmed that an Indian citizen was killed in a military conflict in Ukraine .\nModi immediately held a high-level meeting and expressed condolences to the victim \u2019 s family .\nThe Indian National Congress , the opposition party , still slammed the Modi government for failing to evacuate the Indian students stranded in Ukraine in time .\nTherefore , staying \u201c neutral \u201d but providing humanitarian supplies to Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry out its evacuation work .\nRegardless of these considerations , Indian officials still hope to play a \u201c neutral \u201d role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict .\nBut at the same time , some Indian strategists have been aware that it is increasingly difficult to maintain a \u201c balance \u201d between the US and Russia .\nSome Indian experts have started thinking about India \u2019 s future prospects .\nInterestingly , no matter how hard they try , these Indian experts have not changed their old mindset but continue to treat China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many Indian experts are worried that China will become the biggest winner while India will face a more difficult situation after the Russia-Ukraine conflict .\nAccording to some Indian experts , the conflict has further increased tensions between Russia and Europe , and the United States .\nSuch tensions are unlikely to ease in the short term and have forced Russia to turn to China to offset the West \u2019 s sanctions .\nUndoubtedly , the new market in Russia will also help China resolve its overcapacity problems .\nThis is especially important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the US , its largest trading partner .\nDue to these two factors , Russia may lean toward China in Sino-India disputes , reducing India \u2019 s bargaining chips .\nIn the context of the unresolved Sino-Indian border issue , Russia \u2019 s choice between China and India is inevitably worrying the Indian experts .\nSome Indian experts have also realized that long-term tension with Russia is not conducive to the stability and peace of Europe \u2013 while breaking up with China and Russia simultaneously also does not fulfill EU countries \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break-up with Russia has given China a window of opportunity to draw closer to Europe .\nIt is obvious that the Russia-Ukraine conflict has forced the US to focus on Eastern Europe , reduce its involvement in the Indo-Pacific region and even use the QUAD , a tailor-made anti-China platform , to criticize Russia .\nAll these developments not only favor China but also expose India to a very dangerous situation .\nAlthough India can consider many different diplomatic options in the Russia-Ukraine conflict , it will feel insecure if it still has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such anxiety , India is worried that it won \u2019 t be able to enjoy anymore the support needed from both the US and Russia to balance China .\nThis kind of mentality of \u201c wanting both \u201d may be the real underlying logic of India \u2019 s neutrality on the issue of Russia and Ukraine .\nHowever , as the US-Russia conflict has escalated , it is worthwhile for India to think about whether , by staying neutral , it will win both \u2013 or lose both

maintain its neutrality in the Russia-Ukraine conflict , a government source said .\nSpeaking after the cabinet meeting , Gen Prayut [ Chan-o-cha ] said Thailand will adhere to Asean \u2019 s stance on the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as the grouping has called for dialogue among parties concerned to resolve the Ukraine crisis .\nThailand \u2019 s position mirrors that of China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and infrastructure partner .\nThailand \u2019 s relationship with Russia , like many Southeast Asian countries , is also close and long-standing .\nThe Russian Federation represents for the region a reliable counter-balance to Western influence and interference .\nIn recent years Thailand has begun replacing aging American aircraft with European and Russian alternatives .\nThis includes 3

regarding Russia and Ukraine have regularly injected themselves into the internal political affairs of Thailand , meeting with opposition leaders , accompanying them to police stations , and regularly condemning the Thai government for policing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bangkok \u2019 s streets .\nForeign Minister Don Pramudwinai has accused foreign envoys of breaching diplomatic protocol and intervening in the justice system by being present when Future Forward Party leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit reported to Pathumwan police on a sedition charge .\n\u201c That could not happen in

.\nThat \u2019 s why nobody could have expected that he \u2019 d praise India of all countries during a rally ahead of what \u2019 s shaping out to be the most pivotal week of his political career .\nPakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan unexpectedly praised rival India \u2019 s foreign policy towards Russia during a rally on Sunday ahead of a scheduled no-confidence motion later this week that some observers suspect is secretly orchestrated by the US .\nHe said that \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an independent foreign policy .\nIndia is a member of Quad alliance which also has United States as a member .\nBut it is importing oil from Russia which is facing sanctions .\nIt calls itself neutral .\nIndia has a foreign policy dedicated to its people.\n\u201d These surprising remarks deserve to be interpreted .\nEven those who casually follow South Asian affairs know that Prime Minister Khan despises the Hindu nationalist policies of India \u2019 s ruling BJP , which he \u2019 s described as fascist , Islamophobic , and regionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi on multiple occasions .\nThat \u2019 s why nobody could have expected that he \u2019 d praise India of all countries during a rally ahead of what \u2019 s shaping out to be the most pivotal week of his political career .\nThe purpose behind doing so was severalfold , though , which will now be explained .\nFirst , Prime Minister Khan is showing that he \u2019 s objective enough of a national leader to give credit where it \u2019 s due despite his multiple problems with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighboring country , his has also impressively practiced a policy of principled neutrality following the onset of Russia \u2019 s ongoing special military operation in Ukraine .\nHe also condemned those nearly two dozen Western ambassadors in Islamabad who recently broke protocol by publishing a letter demanding that Pakistan turn against Russia in spite of this indisputably being against that South Asian state \u2019 s national interests .\nBuilding upon the above , the second purpose behind his praise of India is to explain how a country can properly balance between rival partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in a similar position vis-\u00e0-vis those two Great Powers as well as China and the US .\nUnder the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Khan and his patriotic team , Pakistan released its first-ever National Security Policy in January that officially promulgated the policy of refusing to participate in bloc politics .\nIt \u2019 s doing its best to put this into practice but that entire strategy might be threatened if a US-backed opposition comes to power .\nThird , Prime Minister Khan is implying the international legal reality that India and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nations that shouldn \u2019 t be treated differently despite practicing the same policy vis-\u00e0-vis Russia .\nAmerican-affiliated India is still importing oil from US-sanctioned Russia without any consequences thus far from Washington so it follows that similarly American-affiliated Pakistan shouldn \u2019 t be faced with any consequences either for going through with its reported gas and wheat deals with US-sanctioned Russia .\nThe fourth purpose of the Prime Minister \u2019 s praise of India was to draw global attention to the concept of principled neutrality being practiced by that country and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words would generate headlines across the world and thus wanted to ensure that everyone is aware that neutrality still exists despite unprecedented pressure by the US-led West to side with it in that declining unipolar hegemon \u2019 s Hybrid Wars on Russia and China .\nIndia \u2019 s stance towards Russia is the perfect example of principled neutrality since it \u2019 s the largest and most populous country in the world that \u2019 s practicing it .\nAnd finally , the last point that the Pakistani leader wanted to convey is that principled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one \u2019 s people and which advances its practitioner \u2019 s objective national interests .\nThose states like India and Pakistan that practice it are proudly rebuffing unprecedented US-led Western pressure to surrender their strategic sovereignty at the expense of their people \u2019 s interests .\nCapitulating to such foreign forces would be an unforgiveable dereliction of their leaders \u2019 duty to their citizens .\nPrime Ministers Khan and Modi are therefore practicing the most pragmatic policies possible .\nHaving explained the severalfold strategic purposes behind Prime Minister Khan \u2019 s praise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , observers should hopefully have a better understanding of what motivated his unexpected remarks .\nIt all makes sense when considering the larger contexts in which they were made connected to this week \u2019 s no-confidence motion against his government , the recent intensification in the New Cold War \u2019 s Western Eurasian theater between Russia and the US , and the policy of principled neutrality being practiced by his country , India , and many other Global South states .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globalresearch_crg

dismember Russia , and gives an ultimatum to China to stay out of it .\nThe gravity of the situation is sinking in , finally .\nThat is the message coming out of the Cabinet Committee on Security meeting convened by PM Modi on Sunday \u201c to review India \u2019 s security preparedness , and the prevailing global scenario in the context of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine , \u201d where he was briefed \u201c on latest developments and different aspects of India \u2019 s security preparedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the maritime and air domain.\n\u201d The US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan \u2019 s meeting with China \u2019 s top diplomat and Politburo member Yang Jiechi in Rome later today promises to be a defining moment in world politics .\nYesterday , Sullivan explicitly threatened China in an interview with CNN .\nHe said : \u201c We are communicating directly , privately to Beijing , that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them .\nWe will not allow that to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country , anywhere in the world.\n\u201d The warning to China is that it should conform to the US sanctions against Russia and desist from providing support ( \u201c lifeline \u201d ) to Russia in any form .\nThe cutting edge of Sullivan \u2019 s statement is that it also applies to India .\nThe implications are very , very severe .\nSimply put , Washington \u2019 s demand is also be that India should abandon its relationship with Russia .\nThat means principally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship .\nConsidering that something like 60-70 % of weaponry for our armed forces is of Russian origin , this will render a crippling blow to India \u2019 s defence preparedness .\nEssentially , this is going to be baptism by fire for the Indian leadership .\nIt stands to reason that the Americans have already conveyed their charter of demands to the government , and PM \u2019 s hurried move to convene the CCS ensued .\nLast week , the Russian minister of energy had a call with his Indian counterpart where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates but also invited Indian companies to step up investments in Russian oil and gas fields on a preferential basis .\nAt a time when oil price crossed $ 130 a barrel and spot market price for gas is approaching $ 4000 per thousand cubic meters , the Russian offer came as a gift from God .\nBut the fact that the government downplayed it shows a state of paranoia \u2014 symptomatic of the same pusillanimity that characterised the UPA mindset , prompting the rollback of ties with Iran .\nThe Americans have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of straw .\nGiven the scale of corruption , there are all kinds of interest groups in our country .\nBesides , the comprador elements within our elite are stakeholders in the American agenda .\nThat is a tragic fact of life .\nHowever , the difference today is that the looming American threat would have vital bearing on India \u2019 s defence capabilities , and national security .\nFor a government that proclaims the nationalist credo , the choice ought to be clear .\nThe Modi government should refuse to comply with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn all likelihood , Americans are bluffing .\nOr , if there is going to be a price to pay , the leadership should take the nation into confidence and explain the long-term imperative of safeguarding the country \u2019 s core interests at whatever cost .\nIndians are a patriotic people .\nTo my understanding , in the world of today , American hegemony is unsustainable .\nThe US bullies those who are susceptible to bullying and blackmails those ruling elites who are vulnerable to blackmail , individually or collectively .\nHopefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into such a pitiable category .\nFreedom struggle was so much more arduous .\nThe predicament today is also about the country \u2019 s independence .\nThe nation will rally under an inspiring leader .\nThings have come to such a sorry pass today largely due to the flawed foreign policies through the past two decades or so when the American lobbyists began expounding that India \u2019 s interests are best served in an alliance with the US .\n\u2018 Non-Alignment \u2019 and \u2018 strategic autonomy \u2019 became archaic concepts .\nThus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed the Rubicon \u2019 , to borrow the title

strategic immunity proved horribly wrong in their assessment of international politics .\nBeyond the Rubicon , what we saw and experienced was a bleached landscape of parched earth and birds of prey , so different from the El Dorado that we were promised by the carpetbaggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course correction .\nIndia should distance itself completely from the self-centred US polices whose aim is the preservation of its global hegemony .\nThe first step in that direction should be to quit Quad .\nMake no mistake , a US-China showdown is in the making sooner than one might have expected it , and it will be calamitous for India to get sucked into it .\nThe visit by Japanese prime minister Kishida to India this weekend causes disquiet .\nBy the colour of our skin , our religion , our culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we will never be accepted by the West as \u2018 one of us \u2019 .\nDo not be mesmerised by promises of equal partnerships .\nLook at the US \u2019 track record \u2014 selfish , cynical and ruthless in the pursuit of its interests .\nHistory didn \u2019 t end with the eclipse of the Cold War .\nFundamentally , what the Western powers are planning is a form of neo-colonialism borne out of the desperate need to arrest the decline of their economies through a massive transfer of wealth from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of mankind \u2014 Asia , in particular .\nTo that end , the West has unceremoniously buried \u2018 globalisation \u2019 and turned its back on multilateralism .\nQuintessentially , what is unfolding is no different from 19th century colonial era .\nTherefore , India

Armed Forces directed against the people of Donbass started eight years ago , resulting in the destruction of residential areas and more than 10,000 civilian casualties .\nTo watch Japanese television

the suffering , death and destruction caused by the war is all too real and ought to be of concern to all who cherish life and value peace .\nThere is , further , no question that Russia \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine is responsible for the current situation even though , as many observers have noted , the US , NATO and Ukrainian leaders deliberately provoked Russia into taking military action .\nNevertheless , in concert with the Japanese public \u2019 s genuine concern for the plight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking place in Japan that is using the Ukrainian crisis as a pretext to further expand the Japanese military and strengthen its military alliance with the US .\nIn a Reuter \u2019 s article , dated March 17th , Kono Taro , a leading conservative politician , former defense chief and ex-foreign minister said , \u201c We need to tell the people in Japan that in order to protect ourselves we need to help the others too .\nIf there is any aggression anywhere on this planet , we need to stop them.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eminently reasonable and positive statement .\nWho does not believe that war anytime and anyplace ought to be stopped !\nHowever , the question must be asked , is this really Japan \u2019 s position ?\nAre the expressions of concern on the part of Japan \u2019 s conservative leaders genuine or do they consist of \u201c crocodile tears , \u201d i.e .\nhiding their satisfaction with the turn of events in that they strengthen their case for convincing the Japanese people to further rearm while revising Japan \u2019 s \u201c peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time of America \u2019 s second invasion of Iraq in 2003 , Japan did nothing to stop , let alone even criticize , the US invasion .\nIf Japan is opposed to \u201c aggression anywhere on this planet \u201d why did it do nothing to stop the US ?\nThe answer , of course , is that the two countries have had a robust military alliance since 1952 .\nUS influence in the alliance is so powerful that in 2003 Japan dispatched more than 1,000 soldiers to an allegedly \u201c non-combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in Japan \u2019 s postwar history that it sent troops abroad other than UN-sponsored peace-keeping operations .\nFurther , it was done in spite of the provisions of Article Nine of its constitution that forbids Japan \u2019 s military from waging war overseas .\nNon-combat zone or not , Japan \u2019 s troops were well prepared with anti-tank rocket launchers and recoilless guns , all deemed necessary to protect against suicide bombers .\nAt the time , Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro justified Japan \u2019 s military support for the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made many sacrifices to create a viable democracy in Iraq , therefore Japan must be a trustworthy ally for the United States.\n\u201d In 2016 I had the opportunity to personally ask the former prime minister if , in retrospect , he had any regrets about his support for the US invasion based , as it was , entirely on falsehoods .\nKoizumi replied , \u201c I have none.\n\u201d Koizumi then changed the subject and told me how much he had enjoyed his visit to Graceland , Elvis Presley \u2019 s home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 2006 .\nThe March 17th Reuters article introduced above went on to explain that Japan now counts neighboring China as its top national security threat , closely followed by North Korea and Russia .\nSome officials in Tokyo , including Kono , worry that Russia \u2019 s attack on Ukraine may encourage China to attack Taiwan inasmuch as China considers Taiwan a renegade province .\nSeparated by only about 100 kilometers from the nearest Japanese island , Japan claims that were Taiwan to be taken over by Beijing , Chinese forces would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its maritime trade routes .\nKono Taro noted that China \u2019 s \u201c spending on forces is four times more than our national defense budget .\nJapan alone couldn \u2019 t fight against the Chinese forces if they invade Japan.\n\u201d Why China would invade Japan , even if it were to invade Taiwan , is something Kono failed to explain .\nBut such an explanation may not be necessary since Japan \u2019 s conservative politicians never tire of \u201c telling the people in Japan that in order to protect ourselves we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c others \u201d begin , of course , with the US but recently have grown to include Australia , and possibly India , as well as Japan .\nIt is important to realize that the current financial and military bleeding of Russia in Ukraine has long been a cherished goal of the US .\nFor example , in 2019 , long before the current Ukrainian crisis , the conservative and very influential Rand Corporation in the US published a report entitled , \u201c Overextending and Unbalancing Russia : Assessing the impact of Cost-imposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c impose options that the United States and its allies could pursue across economic , political , and military areas to stress , overextend and unbalance\u2014 Russia \u2019 s economy and armed forces and the regime \u2019 s political standing at home and abroad.\n\u201d Concretely , its recommendations included : \u201c Providing lethal aid to Ukraine so as to exploit Russia \u2019 s greatest point of external vulnerability.\n\u201d In doing so , the report noted that while the likelihood of success in extending Russia was only \u201c moderate , \u201d the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the costs and risks were also \u201c high.\n\u201d The reason the cost and risks were labelled \u201c high \u201d was because \u201c any increase in US military arms and advice to Ukraine would need to be carefully calibrated to increase the costs to Russia of sustaining its existing commitment without provoking a much wider conflict in which Russia , by reason of proximity , would have significant advantages.\n\u201d The same report also encouraged the US government to \u201c undermine Russia \u2019 s image abroad ; encourage domestic protests ; impose deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to degrade the Russian economy , and increase Europe \u2019 s ability to import gas from suppliers other than Russia.\n\u201d The report went so far as to recommend \u201c encouraging the emigration from Russia of skilled labor and well-educated youth.\n\u201d Seen from the perspective of this report , if not the US government , the current war in Ukraine is nothing short of \u2018 mana from heaven \u2019 at least for those who are not dying or becoming refugees in foreign lands .\nIt is not only conservative politicians in Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The question is , will China be next in line for similar treatment , this time at the hands of both Japan and the US , supported by Australia and possibly India , a group collectively known as the \u201c Quad \u201d ?\nReaders of my previous article , \u201c Pearl Harbor Comes to Taiwan \u201d will recall a March 2021 report I introduced from the Hoover Institution , a second influential conservative US thinktank .\nInterested readers will find the previous article here .\nThe report \u2019 s authors , Robert D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their belief that as the US continues to pour weapons into Taiwan , just as it has in Ukraine , the Chinese side will , at some point , say enough is enough and either establish a quarantine of additional weapons or even conduct a siege and assault of the island .\nBlackwill and Zelikow assert that once China has acted the US should \u201c establish a carefully orchestrated military challenge of a PRC quarantine or siege and assault .\nThe coordinated military challenge would be calibrated to present Chinese forces with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through , or shoot down planes and sink ships , in a clash that would kill numbers of Americans or Japanese , or both .\nThe Chinese would thus either initiate a local war ( in the quarantine scenario ) or widen it by choosing to attack these neutral vessels or aircraft.\n\u201d ( Italics mine ) As for the Japanese , Blackwill and Zelikow write , \u201c Many Japanese prefer peace and abhor the militarism of the past .\nBut this could change .\nOutsiders should not underestimate just how fast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and change , once a consensus has been formed about the need to act .\nThis part of the joint US-Japan campaign plan should develop , in advance , the scale and character of how Japan should prepare to defend itself in the aftermath of a local war.\n\u201d On December 23 , 2021 the Japan Times reported : \u201c The Self-Defense Forces [ SDF ] and the US military have drawn up a draft joint operation plan that would

refineries and telecom , public as well as private sector ( including multinational companies ) .\nThere was a significant presence of women in the strike , particularly those employed in various development schemes , often at very low wages .\nThe strike was in addition supported by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha , an umbrella organization of 40 farmers \u2019 organizations which had spearheaded a massive and successful farmers \u2019 protest movement last year .\nThis strike call was given at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burdens of unemployment and inflation .\nRates of urban unemployment have been at high levels , while the price of essential goods has been increasing .\nIn the process most worker households have faced increasing difficulties in making basic needs .\nReports of workers being made to work for longer hours in more difficult conditions have appeared increasingly , resulting in several industrial and construction site accidents .\nThe demands voiced by these workers include the protection of labor rights won by years of struggle as several of these rights are likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of the government \u2019 s insistence on \u2018 consolidating \u2019 them in 4 labor codes .\nFor example there has been increasing uncertainty that important gains achieved by construction workers from two laws made specifically for them may be diluted even though efforts made in recent years for their better implementation have resulted in favorable decisions even from the Supreme Court .\nJust when they were thinking that the proper implementation of the directives of the Supreme Court of India will provide them significant , overdue gains resulting from the two existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uncertainty of the new labor codes .\nAs several labor activists point out , the uncertainties at the ground level are much more compared to what the government cares to admit .\nThere are increasing apprehensions of workers losing jobs and rights in the course of policies of relentlessly increasing privatization under different names and schemes .\nInstead of striving to rapidly increasing social security cover to unorganized sector workers who are largely deprived of this , the policies of the government are widely seen to be creating more uncertain and difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works including women in recent years have been devastated in recent years by the combined impact of prolonged lockdowns as well as arbitrary , adverse government policy decisions like the one on demonetization which suddenly put out of circulation 86 % of the currency at one blow .\nThis strike call was also accompanied by demands for increasing allocation for rural employment guarantee scheme ( MGNREGA ) .\nThis is seen as a very helpful scheme , started by the previous UPA government , which has attracted much attention outside India as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out repeatedly that its budget needs to be increased significantly beyond the present allocation to cope with compelling needs of recent times .\nAn urban employment guarantee scheme has also been demanded in recent years and in fact has already been initiated by some state governments in smaller ways , more particularly by the Rajasthan government very recently .\nHowever a bigger initiative by the central government regarding this is still awaited .\nMuch higher allocations for social sector including health , nutrition and education are widely regarded as long overdue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs of weaker sections .\nThis should include significant increase in the allocations for important schemes which should also include provision for increasing the wages of workers employed in these schemes , most of whom are women and have toiled for long hours daily at less than the legal minimum wage rate .\nIn remote villages I have met cooks , often elderly women , who have been preparing meals for around 100 or more school children while getting around Rs .\n40 a day on average ( about half a dollar ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delayed .\nAll these demands have been raised in the course of this strike call .\nThese demands include old demands like those relating to regularization of contract workers but also involve relatively new ones like those relating to the much better protection and remuneration of those health and sanitation workers who have been in the forefront of the COVID 19 efforts .\nThere are also much debated issues relating to the restoration of the old pension scheme .\nReforms which can protect worker and employee interests while also accommodating fiscal concerns have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps a middle path can be explored with broad-based consultations .\nHowever most of the demands of the workers voiced at the time of this recent strike call are well-justified and it is heartening to see that workers are agitating not just for protecting their own interests but also for protecting the wider interests of people in such crucial areas as banking , insurance and health .\nThere should be adequate follow-up efforts after the strike to reach out to more people so that with greater public education on these significant issues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important

interceptors on-board , ostensibly to protect against North Korean missile launches , gives the US greater ability to launch preemptive first-strike attacks on China .\nThe US now has 30 ground-based MD interceptors deployed in South Korea .\nMany peace activists there maintain that the ultimate target of these systems is not North Korea , but China and Russia .\nThe current US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea

the keys to the world \u2019 s economic engine still remains in charge .\nChina , for example , imports up to 80 % of its oil on ships through the Yellow Sea .\nIf any competitor nation was able to militarily control that transit route and choke off China \u2019 s oil supply , its economy could be held hostage .\nOne is able to see how the Pentagon will use the South Korean Navy base on Jeju Island , now being constructed despite a seven-year determined non-violent campaign opposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coastal blockade of China .\nFor many years Russia and China have introduced resolutions at the UN calling for negotiations on a new treaty that would ban weapons in space .\nSince the mid- \u2018 80s every UN member nation has supported the \u201c Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space \u201d ( PAROS ) resolution , with the exception of the US , Israel , and Micronesia .\nThis was true during the Clinton presidency as well as during the reign of George W.

that a peace process be initiated with a view to preventing escalation .\nGlobal Research does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine .\nThe history of this war must be understood .\nThe bombing and shelling led by Ukraine \u2019 s Armed Forces directed against the people of Donbass started eight years ago , resulting in the destruction of residential areas and more than 10,000 civilian casualties .\nFirst published on APR on March 15 , 2022 Accompanying his comments were the flags of the United States , the UK , France , Germany , and Canada among others who visited Thailand \u2019 s Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lecture Thailand over what its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nA Bangkok Post article titled , \u201c Neutral on Russia-Ukraine : PM , \u201d would note , however , that Thailand would remain neutral .\nThe article reported : Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha has insisted Thailand will maintain its neutrality in the Russia-Ukraine conflict , a government source said .\nSpeaking after the cabinet meeting , Gen Prayut [ Chan-o-cha ] said Thailand will adhere to Asean \u2019 s stance on the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as the grouping has called for dialogue among parties concerned to resolve the Ukraine crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of China \u2013 Thailand largest investor , trade partner , and infrastructure partner .\nThailand \u2019 s relationship with Russia , like many Southeast Asian countries , is also close and long-standing .\nThe Russian Federation represents for the region a reliable counter-balance to Western influence and interference .\nIn recent years Thailand has begun replacing aging American aircraft with European and Russian alternatives .\nThis includes 3 Sukhoi Superjets used by the Royal Thai Airforce for transportation , as well as several Mil Mi-17 and Kamov Ka-32 helicopters used for military transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nConversely , ties with the West have frayed particularly with the United States who for years now funded and encouraged violent protesters in their bid to overthrow the current China ( and also Russia ) friendly government from power and replace it with leadership backed by and working for Washington , London , and Brussels .\nThese same representatives recently lecturing Thailand on its stance regarding Russia and Ukraine have regularly injected themselves into the internal political affairs of Thailand , meeting with opposition leaders , accompanying them to police stations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policing the often violent protests the Western-backed opposition organizes in Bangkok \u2019 s streets .\nForeign Minister Don Pramudwinai has accused foreign envoys of breaching diplomatic protocol and intervening in the justice system by being present when Future Forward Party leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit reported to Pathumwan police on a sedition charge .\n\u201c That could not happen in their own countries , but they did it in our country .\nWe will ask them to cooperate and not to do that again .\nIt was against the diplomatic protocols of the United Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House on Tuesday .\nThese same representatives blatantly violating Thailand \u2019 s sovereignty and interfering in the nation \u2019 s internal political affairs in recent years , now want to recruit Thailand to support them and their efforts to do likewise \u2013 undermine peace , stability , and sovereignty \u2013 in Eastern Europe .\nIn a bid to pressure the Thai government over Ukraine and Russia , the same Western-backed opposition groups and media platforms attempting to overthrow the current Thai government for years , is now being mobilized to poison the Thai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for not taking a firm stance alongside ( or perhaps at the feet of ) the West .\nThis includes Prachatai , funded by the US government through the National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) and whose director is an NED fellow .\nPrachatai has published multiple articles promoting recent anti-Russian protests carried out by US-backed opposition groups and Ukrainian expatriates .\nHowever , the Western-backed opposition in Thailand has made itself incredibly unpopular , particularly from 2019 onward .\nThe fact that the Thai opposition is compromised by its Western backers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thais and the reality behind Ukraine-Russian tensions is openly discussed from a Russian point of view among at least some prominent Thai media platforms .\nWhile US-funded and influenced media will parrot Western talking points regarding Russia , much of Thailand \u2019 s media will remain neutral with at least some

tensions with Russia playing out in Europe are being felt in different ways already in Asia .\nThe hypothesis of Ukraine being in Europe and the conflict being all about European security is delusional .\nFrom Kazakhstan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kuril Islands , from North Korea to Cambodia , from China to India , Pakistan and Afghanistan , the fault lines are appearing .\nTo be sure , extra-regional powers had a hand in the failed colour revolution recently to overthrow the established government in Kazakhstan , a hotly contested geopolitical landmass two-thirds the size of India , bordering both China and Russia , Washington \u2019 s sworn adversaries .\nThanks to swift Russian intervention , supported by China , a regime change was averted .\nEqually , the Anglo-American project to embroil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed insurgency has floundered for want of a sanctuary in India \u2019 s northeastern region and due to the perceived congruence of interests among the surrounding countries in Myanmar \u2019 s stability .\nIn comparison , the North Korean fault line has aggravated .\nNorth Korea moves on its own timetable and has probably decided that the Ukraine crisis offers useful cover while it ramps up its testing program .\nPyongyang explicitly supports Russia \u2019 s special operation in Ukraine , commenting that \u201c the basic cause of the Ukraine incident lies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , which has ignored Russia \u2019 s legitimate calls for security guarantees and only sought a global hegemony and military dominance while clinging to its sanctions campaigns.\n\u201d North Korea \u2019 s objective is to enhance its security and leverage by increasing the quality and quantity of its deterrent capabilities and strengthening its bargaining position .\nOn another plane , the Ukraine crisis injected a new urgency into the US efforts to cultivate new Asian partners .\nBut Washington has run into headwinds and had to indefinitely postpone a special summit with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) that was initially scheduled for end-March .\nNo new date has been proposed , although the US had hyped up the summit as \u201c a top priority.\n\u201d Showing some ire , Washington has since sanctioned Cambodia , currently the ASEAN Chair .\nClearly , the southeast Asian countries are chary of taking sides between the US and China or of voicing criticism against Russia .\nPerhaps , the most direct fallout of the Ukraine crisis in Asia so far is the sharp deterioration in Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an unwarranted development insofar as Tokyo simply did a cut and paste job , copying all the US sanctions against Russia ( including against President Putin ) .\nPrime Minister Kishida wantonly destroyed what his predecessor Shinzo Abe had carefully cultivated as a cordial , friendly relationship .\nJapan now openly refers to Russian \u201c occupation \u201d of the Kuril Islands \u2014 something it hasn \u2019 t been doing in the past .\nMoscow retaliated by designating Japan as an \u201c unfriendly \u201d country .\nYet , analysts were estimating until recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in blocking China \u2019 s Arctic ambitions and were , therefore , moving toward solving their dispute over Kuril .\nSuffice to say , Kishida \u2019 s motivations in an abrupt turnaround to make an Kuril a potential flashpoint in relations with Russia are , to say the least , to be traced to the broader US strategy to isolate Russia .\nMeanwhile , a contrarian development has also appeared in China \u2019 s challenge to the US \u2019 Island Chain strategy in the Western Pacific by negotiating a new security deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have extensive consequences and is dangerously interwoven with the Taiwan issue .\nBiden is reportedly dispatching a top White House official to Solomon Islands to scuttle the deal with China .\nThe Biden administration is now doubling down on India to roll back its ties with Russia as well .\nThat becomes a fault line in the US-Indian strategic partnership .\nWhat must be particularly galling for Washington is the likelihood of India pursuing its trade and economic cooperation with Russia in local currencies .\nIndeed , China and India have taken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nGiven the size of the Chinese economy and the high potential of growth for the Indian economy , their inclination to bypass the dollar would be a trend-setter for other countries .\nRussia , hit by Western sanctions , has called on the BRICS group of emerging economies to extend the use of national currencies and integrate payment systems .\nSuffice to say , the \u201c weaponised dollar \u201d and the West \u2019 s abrasive move to freeze Russia \u2019 s reserves sends a chill down the spine of most developing countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Millennium Challenge Corporation agreement following threat by a middle ranking US official !\nThere is no conceivable reason why the NATO should become the provider of security for the Asian region .\nThat is why Afghanistan \u2019 s future is of crucial importance .\nWithout doubt , the regime change in Pakistan is partly at least related to Afghanistan .\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry has disclosed certain details of the US interference in Pakistan \u2019 s internal affairs and its pressure on former Prime Minister Imran Khan .\nBut time will show how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inducting Pakistan into the US orbit and making it a surrogate to leverage the Taliban regime in Afghanistan .\nRussia and China are making sure that the door remains closed to NATO \u2019 s return to

to undertake a lead role .\nThus , the regional states have incrementally marked their distance from the West \u2019 s exceptionalism and are instead adopting a persuasive track through constructive engagement .\nThe joint statement issued at Tunxi reflects this new thinking .\nThe developments over Afghanistan provide a signpost that any attempt at imposing Western dominance over Asia will be resisted by the regional states .\nMost Asian countries have had bitter experiences with colonialism in their history .\n( See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West vs. Russia ) Although the American analysts underplay it , the fact remains that the conflict in Ukraine is bound to impact the \u201c Asian Century \u201d very significantly .\nThe US is determined to transform the NATO as the global security

attention as this .\nDespite being in caretaker mode as it battles the federal election , the government of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison still had room to politicise its anti-China twitch .\nThe person given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for International Development and the Pacific , Senator Zed Seselja .\nIn a quick visit to Honiara to have discussions with Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare , Seselja stated that Australia remained dedicated to supporting the security needs of the Solomon Islands , and would do so \u201c swiftly , transparently and with full respect for its sovereignty \u201d .\nThe Pacific country remained a friend , part of the \u201c Pacific family \u201d .\nWhile not specifically condemning the waywardness of the Sogavare government in forging closer ties with Beijing , Seselja explicitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solomon Islands-China security agreement.\n\u201d Using the familiar talking point of pushing regional familial ties , the Minister insisted that \u201c the Pacific family will always meet the security needs of our region.\n\u201d In a tone suggesting both plea and clenched fist , Seselja went on to claim that Solomon Islands had been \u201c respectfully \u201d asked to reject the pact and \u201c consult the Pacific family in the spirit of regional openness and transparency , consistent with our region \u2019 s security frameworks.\n\u201d The origins of this badgering stem from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online by an adviser to the disgruntled Malaita Provincial Government of Premier Derek Suidani .\nThat , in of itself , was telling of local domestic tussles , given Suidani \u2019 s opposition to increasing influence from Beijing and his own tilt towards Taiwan .\nAccording to Article 1 of the draft , the Solomon Islands may request China to \u201c send police , police military personnel and other law enforcement and armed forces \u201d for reasons of maintaining social order , protecting lives and property , providing humanitarian assistance , carrying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on other tasks agreed upon by the Parties \u201d .\nWith the consent of Honiara , China may also \u201c make ship visits to , carry out logistical replenishment in , and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands \u201d .\nChinese personnel may also be used in protecting Chinese personnel and projects on the islands .\nAmongst Australia \u2019 s talking heads and hacks was a sense of horror .\nGreg Sheridan , writing for The Australian , saw parallels with Japan \u2019 s aims during the Second World War \u201c to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific territories , specifically Guadalcanal in what is now the Solomons.\n\u201d The same paper described the deal as \u201c a nightmare in paradise.\n\u201d Canberra and Washington are also concerned by what is seen as a lack of candour on the part of Beijing , a tad rich coming from powers that mischievously formed the AUKUS pact in conditions of total secrecy .\nArticle 5 expressly notes that \u201c neither party shall disclose the cooperation information to a third party \u201d without written consent of the other party , which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solomon Islands are not to know the content of the agreement .\nThat would put them in a similar position to Australians who have an incomplete picture on the role played by US military installations such as Pine Gap , or the broader expectations of AUKUS .\nThe extent Sogavare and his ministers are being badgered by Australian dignitaries is notable .\nTheir message : We acknowledge your independence as long as it is exercised in our national ( read US ) interest .\nThis was the theme of the visit earlier this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Australian Secret Intelligence Service , and Andrew Shearer , Director-General of the Office of National Intelligence .\nAccording to a note from Sogavare \u2019 s office , the visitors discussed \u201c Australia \u2019 s core security concerns \u201d about a potential Chinese military presence in the country .\nBoth Symon and Shearer were told that Honiara \u2019 s \u201c security concerns are domestically focused and complements [ the ] current bilateral Agreement with Australia and the regional security architecture.\n\u201d This view is unlikely to have swayed officials tone deaf to local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tag team to Australia \u2019 s efforts , has given Kurt Campbell , the US National Security Council Coordinator for the Indo-Pacific , the task of changing Sogavare \u2019 s mind .\nHe promises to visit the Pacific state along with Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs , Daniel Kritenbrink , later this month .\nUS lawmakers are also keen to hold the fort against Chinese influence in the Pacific and are excited about the prospects of using Australian soil to do so .\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an answer .\n\u201c I see an opening in this part of the world to push back on China in a way that would fundamentally change the fear that you have of a very bad neighbour , \u201d he told Sky News Australia on April 13 .\nThe proposed Honiara-Beijing pact shows how neither Australia , nor the US , can hope to buy Honiara \u2019 s unqualified allegiance to its own policies .\nIt worried Australian Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews , who responded to the news of the draft by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbourhood and we are very concerned of any activity that is taking place in the Pacific Islands.\n\u201d To date , Solomon Islands has been treated as a failed state , a security risk in need of pacification , and a country distinctly incapable of exercising plenary power .\nAustralia has adopted an infantilising , charity-based approach , shovelling billions into the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands ( RAMSI ) .\nAustralian High Commissioner Lachlan Strahan was quick to reassure Sogavare that Canberra would be extending the mission till December 2023 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget support , a second patrol boat outpost and a national radio network .\nNone of these ongoing factors have prevented discussions between Honiara and Beijing on security issues .\nChinese police officers were sent to the Solomon

the money back , they are at the creditor \u2019 s mercy .\nHowever , loans from China accounted for only about 10 % of Sri Lanka \u2019 s total foreign debt in 2020 .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be attributed to international sovereign bonds .\nJapan actually accounts for a higher proportion of their foreign debt , at 11 % .\nDefaults over China \u2019 s infrastructure-related loans to Sri Lanka , especially the financing of the Hambantota port , are being cited as factors contributing to the crisis .\nBut these facts don \u2019 t add up .\nThe construction of the Hambantota port was financed by the Chinese Exim Bank .\nThe port was running losses , so Sri Lanka leased out the port for 99 years to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which paid Sri Lanka US $ 1.12 billion .\nSo the Hambantota port fiasco did not lead to a balance of payments crisis ( where more money or exports are going out than coming in ) , it actually bolstered Sri Lanka \u2019 s foreign exchange reserves by US $ 1.12 billion .\nSo what are the real reasons for the crisis ?\nPost-independence from the British in 1948 , Sri Lanka \u2019 s agriculture was dominated by export-oriented crops such as tea , coffee , rubber and spices .\nA large share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreign exchange earned from exporting these crops .\nThat money was used to import essential food items .\nOver the years , the country also began exporting garments , and earning foreign exchange from tourism and remittances ( money sent into Sri Lanka from abroad , perhaps by family members ) .\nAny decline in exports would come as an economic shock , and put foreign exchange reserves under strain .\nFor this reason , Sri Lanka frequently encountered balance of payments crises .\nFrom 1965 onwards , it obtained 16 loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nEach of these loans came with conditions including that once Sri Lanka received the loan they had to reduce their budget deficit , maintain a tight monetary policy , cut government subsidies for food for the people of Sri Lanka , and depreciate the currency ( so exports would become more viable ) .\nBut usually in periods of economic downturns , good fiscal policy dictates governments should spend more to inject stimulus into the economy .\nThis becomes impossible with the IMF conditions .\nDespite this situation , the IMF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy soaked up more and more debt .\nThe last IMF loan to Sri Lanka was in 2016 .\nThe country received US $ 1.5 billion for three years from 2016 to 2019 .\nThe conditions were familiar , and the economy \u2019 s health nosedived over this period .\nGrowth , investments , savings and revenues fell , while the debt burden rose .\nA bad situation turned worse with two economic shocks in 2019 .\nFirst , there was a series of bomb blasts in churches and luxury hotels in Colombo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a steep decline in tourist arrivals \u2013 with some reports stating up to an 80 % drop\u2013 and drained foreign exchange reserves .\nSecond , the new government under President Gotabaya Rajapaksa irrationally cut taxes .\nValue-added tax rates ( akin to some nations \u2019 goods and services taxes ) were cut from 15 % to 8 % .\nOther indirect taxes such as the nation building tax , the pay-as-you-earn tax and economic service charges were abolished .\nCorporate tax rates were reduced from 28 % to 24 % .\nAbout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lostin revenues because of these tax cuts .\nIn March 2020 , the COVID-19 pandemic struck .\nIn April 2021 , the Rajapaksa government made another fatal mistake .\nTo prevent the drain of foreign exchange reserves , all fertiliser imports were completely banned .\nSri Lanka was declared a 100 % organic farming nation .\nThis policy , which was withdrawn in November 2021 , led to a drastic fall in agricultural production and more imports became necessary .\nBut foreign exchange reserves remained under strain .\nA fall in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ban on fertiliser also led to lower export incomes .\nDue to lower export incomes , there was less money available to import food and food shortages arose .\nBecause there is less food and other items to buy , but no decrease in demand , the prices for these goods rise .\nIn February 2022 , inflation rose to 17.5 % .\nWhat will happen now ?\nIn all probability , Sri Lanka will now obtain a 17th IMF loan to tide over the present crisis , which will come with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be followed , which will further limit the prospects of economic revival and exacerbate the sufferings of the Sri Lankan people .\nNote to readers : Please click the share

Australia have been panicking ever since about a possible Chinese foothold .\nWashington has rushed top White House and State Department officials to Honiara to pressure their government to cancel the agreement , but this has served mostly to annoy them and signal that the U.S. doesn \u2019 t respect their sovereign decisions .\nThe United States routinely rails against the idea of spheres of influence when other states claim them , but in its rivalry with China the U.S. assumes that Pacific Island nations belong firmly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are likely too late to change minds in the Solomon Islander government , and they show that the U.S. doesn \u2019 t really believe that small states get to make their own decisions when it comes to foreign policy .\nThe details of the final agreement with China are not yet public , but the pact is believed to be close to the leaked draft version that became available last month .\nAccording to that version , the government can request China to send police and military personnel in the event of local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country last year caused by longstanding internal divisions and resentment that the government switched its diplomatic relations from Taiwan to China three years ago .\nBecause of Australia \u2019 s traditional role as security provider for the country , news of the agreement with China has been received very poorly in Canberra .\nAustralia \u2019 s Labor Party seized on the issue to criticize the coalition government and characterized it the \u201c worst Australian foreign policy blunder in the Pacific \u201d since WWII .\nThere has even been some reckless talk from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bring down the government to halt the agreement .\nWhile it is understandable that Australia has concerns about closer ties between China and one of its neighbors , the reaction to this agreement has been out of all proportion to its significance .\nFor its part , the U.S. has neglected the Solomon Islands and taken the country for granted for many years , and it is only when it seems to be drifting towards Beijing \u2019 s orbit that our government can be bothered to pay close attention .\nThere hadn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honiara for almost 30 years until it announced it was being reopened earlier this year , and even that was justified as an anti-Chinese move .\nWashington says that it believes that small states should be able to decide for themselves about how to make their security arrangements and decide their foreign policy orientation , but it doesn \u2019 t adhere to that line when a government builds closer ties with China .\nThe Solomon Islands \u2019 prime minister has assured the U.S. and Australia that its agreement with China does not pose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won \u2019 t involve any China bases on their territory , but that has not stopped officials from both countries from opposing the agreement in the strongest terms .\nPrime Minister Sogavare responded to the criticism by saying , \u201c We find it very insulting\u2026to be branded as unfit to manage our sovereign affairs.\n\u201d International relations scholar Van Jackson correctly described the reaction in Australia , New Zealand , and the U.S. to the agreement as \u201c absolutely hyperbolic.\n\u201d As he said , \u201c there is nothing about this document that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Chinese sphere of influence.\n\u201d Jackson asks an important question about U.S. and allied goals in the broader \u201c Indo-Pacific \u201d : \u201c What kind of free , open , inclusive Indo-Pacific are you building if you are literally going to try and constrain the foreign relations of independent , sovereign states ?\n\u2026.That \u2019 s literally asserting a Western sphere of influence in trying to deny a Chinese one.\n\u201d The question of spheres of influence is a contentious one in U.S.-Chinese relations .\nWashington professes to abhor spheres of influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the U.S. maintain one in the western Pacific .\nThe U.S. casts spheres of influence as holdovers from an earlier era that have no place in the modern world , but it also carves out its own when it deems it necessary .\nIf the U.S. meant what it said about spheres of influence , it would not be so alarmed by the prospect of a modest security agreement between China and a small Pacific state , but by its actions our government shows just how desperately it clings to the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the U.S. and its allies no matter what the local government wants .\nIf the U.S. hopes to win the trust and cooperation of Pacific and Asian nations in the coming decades , it can not continue with a zero-sum approach that requires small countries to take sides against China .\nUnfortunately , much of the commentary in the U.S. and Australia has been employing ridiculous Cold War-era rhetoric to discuss the Solomon Islands agreement .\nOne article in Politico frames it as a \u201c duel \u201d between Xi and Biden that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. to act before more \u201c dominoes \u201d start falling .\n\u201c Who lost the Solomon Islands ?\n\u201d would be a premature question to ask if it weren \u2019 t so stupid , but this is what years of relentless hyping of \u201c great power competition \u201d encourages .\nThe alarmist response to China \u2019 s agreement with the Solomon Islands is reminiscent of other recent panics over developments involving China that either haven \u2019 t occurred yet or aren \u2019 t all that significant .\nMany Western analysts grossly exaggerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between China and Iran last year with references to an \u201c axis \u201d or an \u201c alliance \u201d that doesn \u2019 t exist .\nMore recently , the Pentagon has been sounding the alarm over a possible Chinese naval base in Equatorial Guinea that isn \u2019 t being built and wouldn \u2019 t pose much of a threat if it did exist .\nChina is expanding its economic and political influence , and over time that will likely include establishing more of an overseas military presence .\nThat bears paying careful attention and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is absurd to fly into panicked fear over every modest agreement that China may be making with other countries .\nThe U.S. can not neglect small nations and then expect them to fall in line when U.S. officials finally show up to complain about their relations with other states .\nIf the U.S. wants to cultivate stronger ties with Pacific and Asian nations , it will have to make a consistent effort to work with these governments on issues of common interest .\nInsofar

the right sort of refugees \u2013 the fair-blue eyed sort \u2013 and the right sort of moral baggage to promote during an election campaign .\nThen , a statement of the obvious , dressed up as a warning : the defence of a country depended on \u201c the willingness of a people to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia depends on us.\n\u201d Not untrue , but hardly explains the fact that the Commonwealth has only ever genuinely needed to defend its own shores once during its short history .\nOther conflicts have seen Australian soldiers as disposable pseudo-Gurkhas , mercenaries for empires , deployed without question and , it should be said , without wisdom , to conflict zones across the globe .\nTheirs not to reason why .\nMorrison recalled some of these engagements \u2013 many defeats in the Gallipoli tradition .\n\u201c From Gallipoli to Mosel , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Afghanistan , from the skies above to the oceans below , what has compelled our soldiers , sailors , aviators , nurses and chaplains is the willingness to defend what they love.\n\u201d Or at least what they were told to love .\nIn a manner condescending to the modestly learned and well-studied , the prime minister suggested that veterans of previous conflicts were not \u201c na\u00efve \u201d , appreciating Australia as having a \u201c liberal democratic \u201d system .\nThis came with freedom of speech , freedom of association , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark is astonishing , as concepts such as free speech or freedom of association do not exist in Australia in any meaningful way \u2013 certainly not constitutionally or as a personal right .\nThe only thing Australians can rely upon is a watered-down constraint on legislative power known as an implied right to communicate on political subjects .\nThere is no constitutional personal right vested in a citizen against the government or executive .\nAs for a free press , Australian federal authorities have raided the homes and offices of journalists , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABC , for publishing and writing about atrocities and violations of civil liberties .\nThe Australian Federal Police even went so far as to advise the Commonwealth Department of Public Prosecution that it could prosecute ABC journalist Dan Oakes , an important figure behind the publication of the Afghan Files .\nA reluctant CDPP decided against it , citing \u201c a range of public interest factors , including the role of public interest journalism in Australia \u2019 s democracy \u201d .\nMorrison \u2019 s idea of Australia as a political nirvana of freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then came from Australia \u2019 s Defence Minister , Peter Dutton , upon whom the muse of history , Clio , has never smiled sweetly .\nThis was the occasion to push erroneous comparisons , the sort that any half-competent logician would have dispelled with sour contempt .\nOn Channel 9 , the Minister encouraged peace lovers to prepare for war before searching the historical record for an anchor .\n\u201c People like Hitler and others aren \u2019 t just a figment of our imagination or that they \u2019 re consigned to history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c We have in President [ Vladimir ] Putin somebody at the moment who is willing to kill women and children .\nAnd that \u2019 s happening in the year 2022.\n\u201d The Australian-backed Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is also doing the same thing in Yemen , but the House of Saud did not offer useful material .\nWith Hitler now in the comparative mix , Dutton could expand with comic effect .\nThe People \u2019 s Republic of China , he suggested , could also be compared to Nazi Germany \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s pre-Second World War guise .\nBoth countries annexed territory , and Germany did so ahead of its invasion of Poland in 1939 .\nDetails were otherwise sketchy , the history student found wanting , but the moral of the tale was clear .\n\u201c We have to stand up with countries to stare down any act of aggression to make sure that we can keep peace in our region and for our country.\n\u201d No \u201c curling up into a ball \u201d , he advised .\nTo do so would result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d With Dutton and Morrison holding the reins of power , such mistakes are guaranteed .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on Instagram , Twitter and Facebook

been released by Yale University Press .\nThe book is based on more than 10 years of research on the Global Hibakusha Project with my research collaborator Mick Broderick .\nThis article provides a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn more and watch some lectures at the book \u2019 s website : Nuclear Bodies : The Global Hibakusha .\nWho are the \u201c global hibakusha \u201d ?\nAs many of us know , hibakusha is the Japanese word used to refer to those who survived the two nuclear attacks conducted by the United States against the people living in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 .\nThose attacks killed between 100,000 and 200,000 human beings instantly , and wounded as many .\nHundreds of thousands of survivors were exposed to radiation from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror , we calm ourselves with the reassuring thought that nuclear weapons have not been used since 1945 .\nHowever , there have been over 2,000 nuclear weapon detonations since then , and because of the size of the weapons and the scale of their effects , millions of people have been exposed to radiation under their fallout clouds , even as the detonations are called \u201c tests.\n\u201d Millions more have been exposed from nuclear production and nuclear accidents .\nThese millions are the global hibakusha .\nMany think of the Cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons were never used .\nHowever , statistically , a nuclear weapon was detonated every 8.6 days between 1946 and 1989 .\nIn reality nuclear weapons were exploding constantly throughout the Cold War .\nNuclear Bodies assesses the consequences for those living close to the locations of those detonations .\nNuclear weapons have been tested on every continent except South America and Antarctica .\nThe site with the most nuclear weapon tests on Earth is the Nevada Test Site in the United States with over 900 nuclear weapon detonations .\nThe primary nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in modern day Kazakhstan , with almost 500 nuclear explosions .\nThe people living near test sites have had profound experiences with radioactive fallout .\nSeveral nuclear weapon states have conducted tests in the Pacific , the U.S. in the Marshall Islands , the French in French Polynesia and the British in Kiribati .\nThere were more than 200 tests in the Russian Arctic near Scandinavia , including the largest thermonuclear weapon ever detonated .\nTesting numbers rose quickly in the early Cold War when most detonations were conducted in the atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallout far from the test sites .\nIn 1962 there were 178 nuclear weapon tests\u2014statistically , a nuclear detonation virtually every other day throughout that year , including massive hydrogen bomb tests .\nWhile no population was directly attacked with nuclear weapons after Hiroshima and Nagasaki , exposure to radioactive fallout can be understood as an attack .\nTo understand this , it is necessary to grasp how exposure to radioactive waves and radioactive particles differ .\nWhen a nuclear weapon is detonated , living creatures are exposed to radiation in two distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst of gamma and neutron waves that radiate out from the epicenter .\nThis burst is only one form of the energies that radiate outward from the detonation ; the other primary forms being blast and heat .\nThese energies radiate from the epicenter and dissipate as they spread outward .\nThe radioactive waves pass right through most matter they encounter , including buildings and bodies .\nIn Hiroshima , for everyone within 3 kilometers of the detonation , large amounts of radioactive waves passed through your entire body , damaging cells and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were inside of a building , since they also passed through the structures .\nBeyond 3 km the energy of the waves dissipated to a less harmful level .\nThe burst of radioactive waves lasts less than a minute : similar to an x-ray , it is turned on and then off , leaving no radiation behind .\nThose closest to ground zero may have died in hours , days or weeks .\nOthers slowly developed diseases over the subsequent years and decades , and many experienced early mortality .\nMany people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is radioactive material in the form of particles : stuff that sticks around .\nSome is unfissioned material ( uranium-235 or plutonium ) from the weapon , some are fission products produced by the detonation , and some are particles that are ionized ( made radioactive ) by the detonation .\nThese particles rise up into the mushroom cloud , and as the cloud spreads downwind they \u201c fall-out \u201d of the cloud to the surface of the Earth .\nUnlike gamma waves these particles remain radioactive .\nSome are dangerous only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous for hundreds , or even hundreds of thousands of years .\nOnce they deposit from the cloud to the ground , they can be internalized inside of and often retained by the body .\nBeing chemicals , the body reacts to them as chemicals\u2014it uses them .\nThe body uses iodine in the thyroid gland , so if it internalizes iodine-131 , the radioactive isotope of iodine , it puts that in the thyroid too .\nStrontium-90 , produced in significant amounts by nuclear weapon explosions , is chemically similar to calcium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the bones and teeth .\nIn 1957 , U.S. AEC Commissioner Willard Libby referred to strontium-90 as a \u201c bone seeker.\n\u201d 1 These particles don \u2019 t give off large amounts of radiation , but once internalized into the body they emit this energy to the cells immediately around them 24 hours a day .\nWhere in the body common fallout from radionuclides tends to be retained .\nIn Hiroshima the mushroom cloud drifted to the northwest and large amounts of fallout came down with rain ( precipitation strips particles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the soot from the burning city fell as \u201c Black Rain.\n\u201d Those who lived in the areas where the black rain fell also began to develop sickness from their exposure to radiation .\nMost Black Rain sufferers were too far from the city center to have experienced exposure to any of the energetic wave effects of the nuclear attack , blast , heat or radioactive waves .\nIt took a long time for doctors to understand that those exposed to Black Rain were hibakusha\u2014that they were suffering from exposure to radiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2021 , that these sufferers had their legal rights as hibakusha in Japan recognized by a court decision after decades of litigation .\nWhy did it take more than 70 years to legally recognize those exposed to radioactive fallout as hibakusha in a country where the legal recognition of harm from radiation ( designated status as a hibakusha ) had been established 64 years earlier ?\nMuch of the invisibility of the Black Rain hibakusha , and of the global hibakusha , is rooted in medical models of harm from radiation .\nSoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nagasaki it was recognized that the existence of more than 100,000 hibakusha presented an unprecedented research opportunity .\nBeforehand , the number of people who had been understood to have been exposed to radiation numbered in the hundreds and were spread out over several decades .\nMedical information about the consequences to human health and mortality from radiation exposure had been extrapolated from these cases , animal studies , and probability models .\nBecause of the use of nuclear weapons on human beings , there was now a massive cohort of radiation-exposed individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much more comprehensive model of what radiation does to human health .\nThe United States established the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission ( ABCC ) in 1946 in both Nagasaki and Hiroshima to begin research on the effects of their exposure to radiation on the hibakusha and their descendants .\nThe most consequential of their studies was the Life Span Study ( LSS ) , begun in 1950 and continuing today by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation ( RERF ) , the successor laboratory to the ABCC .\nThe LSS sought to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to subsequent health outcomes .\nThis database was built on two data points , determining how much radiation each participant was exposed to , and tracking their disease history and age of mortality .\nBuilding a database on this information for more than 200,000 people was intended to yield a powerful statistical tool to assess risk for anyone exposed to radiation in the future : if an exposure dose is known , the statistical probability for various health effects can be predicted .\nThere are various problems in the design of the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 dose reconstruction was done based partly on memory and interviews ( less than ideal sources for statistical data components ) .\nNevertheless , it is a widely respected and globally cited study .\nIt is often referred to as the \u201c gold standard \u201d of radiation health effects data .\nFor my work , the most important thing about the LSS is that it only considered external exposure .\nParticipants \u2019 dose is reconstructed wholly based on their estimated exposure to the burst of radioactive waves in the minute of the detonation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from internalizing radionuclides .\nThere are very good reasons for this parameter .\nIn the 1950s it was not possible to determine whether someone had internalized a radioactive particle ; whole body counters , which can make that assessment , each weighing 60 tons , only became available in 1964 .\nAdditionally , hundreds of thousands of people had been in the area affected by the massive burst of gamma rays , so working to compile information about their exposures and health outcomes was a massive research endeavor .\nAs Susan Lindee has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be one in which many nuclear weapons would be used in warfare , feeling that \u201c [ A ] ll conjectures about the nature of the imagined post-war world must be drawn on the experiences at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\u201d 2 But this was not what occurred .\nNuclear weapons have never again been used directly in military conflict .\nThe experiences of the hibakusha in Hiroshima and Nagasaki did not become common .\nWhat did happen is that 520 nuclear weapons would be tested in the atmosphere and create fallout clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common was the experiences of the people who endured the Black Rain\u2014the people it has taken 76 years to recognize as victims of exposure to radiation in the country most legally accepting of such status .\nInternal exposures , not external exposures , is what the Cold War wrought .\nWhen communities downwind from nuclear test sites claimed to be suffering from health problems because of their exposures , invariably the nation that irradiated them , and their local government ( if separate ) , would cite the LSS to dismiss their claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measurable levels of radiation were not high enough to correlate with expected health problems when using the database .\nThis was the wrong tool for the job .\nThe LSS predicted health outcomes after exposures to a single massive exposure to external radiation .\nHowever , the people downwind from the test sites were internalizing particles , as had those in the areas of Black Rain .\nMeasurable levels of radioactive rays may have been low , but the presence of radioactive particles in their ecosystems put them at risk , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LSS tells us nothing about the risks to health from internalizing radiation .\nIt was not useful for assessing or maintaining community health , but it was useful for dismissing the claims of fallout victims and deflecting monetary and political liability .\nThis has been the screen behind which the nuclear weapon states maintained the brutality of their nuclear testing programs , and the invisibility of the harm caused to those beneath the fallout clouds .\nOther cohorts of global hibakusha have experienced different modes of contamination , but the routes of exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many uranium miners have inhaled uranium particles and it has long been known that there is a high incidence of lung cancer among them .\nThe presence of immense piles of uranium tailings alongside mines , left behind by operators when mines are abandoned , have long polluted the water , food and homes of those living in the area .\nA 2019 studydetermined that more than 25 % of mothers and infants born in the Navajo Nation had extremely high levels of uranium in their bodies , even though active mining had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who live near plutonium production facilities ( nuclear reactors and chemical separation plants ) as at Hanford , Washington , or uranium processing facilities that play a role in the enrichment of uranium , find high levels of radionuclides in the water , food and soil of their ecosystems .\nThe \u201c Green Run \u201d experiment at Hanford in 1949 , in which nuclear fuel was processed to extract plutonium when it was \u201c green , \u201d ( without waiting for short-lived radionuclides to decay ) so that intelligence might be gathered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity of the Mayak facility ( the Soviet Union \u2019 s Hanford site ) led to a massive release of iodine-131 that contaminated most of Eastern Washington and Central Oregon ( seriously , click the link and read about this ) .\nThis radioiodine surely made it into the milk consumed by the majority of the children living in the region .\nA plume of radioactive water leaking from the Hanford Tank Farm has been migrating towards the Columbia River for decades .\nPeople live , farm and raise families in the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which operated uranium processing facilities in and around St. Louis during the Manhattan Project and the Cold War , was buried and abandoned in several locations .\nSeveral tons ended up in the West Lake Landfill in Coldwater Creek , Missouri .\nA 2014 report by the state of Missouri found that the presence of the waste had caused a significant increase in cancers to those living nearby , something which they had become viscerally aware of before the study .\nEven more concerning is that an underground fire has been burning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to the radioactive waste .\nIf the waste was to catch fire , the risk for residents , and anyone downwind of the fire , would be catastrophic .\nThis is not the first fire to have burned in the landfill .\nThese are just two of more than 100 weapon production sites in the United States that require remediation from radiation and toxic chemicals , and that have harmed nearby populations .\nNuclear reactors were invented by the Manhattan Project to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons : they were developed before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that nuclear power was \u201c born violent.\n\u201d Since their invention , nuclear fuel melting has occurred roughly once per decade .\nThere were two major nuclear accidents within 11 days in 1957 at military reactors used to manufacture plutonium ( Mayak in the former Soviet Union and Windscale in the UK ) .\nIn 1986 , unit # 4 exploded at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine , in the former Soviet Union .\nA fire burned in the melted reactor core for over two weeks , belching radioactive fallout over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view a reconstruction of the spread of the fallout from the 1957 Windscale Fire over much of the UK and Northern Europe utilizing weather data and modern computer modeling here .\nA map showing the distribution of cesium-137 from that fallout plume that remains measurable on the ground in Europe 30 years after the disaster .\nThis cesium-137 continues to show up in food products throughout Europe every year , especially jams , mushrooms and wild boar ( who eat the mushrooms ) .\nWhile we think of Chernobyl as a disaster that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to present risk to people living far from the site who were not yet born .\nThe triple meltdowns at Fukushima spread radioactive clouds throughout the region , with the primary deposition of fallout being to the northwest of the plants .\nThere too , cesium-137 continues to spreadthrough the ecosystem .\nAs a chemical , cesium-137 is very adept at migrating in nature .\nIt easily passes from air to soil to water to plants to biota .\nIt remains radioactively dangerous for about 300 years , meaning that once it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries of risk will follow .\nIn towns affected by the fallout in Northern Japan from the 3.11 Fukushima nuclear meltdown , the government engages in \u201c decontamination.\n\u201d However , the towns being decontaminated are surrounded by contaminated mountains and forests .\nIt can not be separated from the larger ecosystem , so although soil can be placed in plastic bags and moved \u201c somewhere else , \u201d the particles embedded in the ecosystem surrounding the town will migrate back in with rain and wind and the natural dynamics of life .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can not draw a circle in nature which allows you to successfully isolate the inner circle from the natural world that envelopes it .\nWe must understand such contaminations as holistic events that will affect a large ecosystem over a broad period of time .\nHuman beings are a part of those ecosystems , we are also embedded in them .\nBecause the dangers from these radionuclides are widely dispersed in both space and time , we can have no certainty whether we or our loved ones will suffer , or will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This uncertainty can itself be destabilizing even if sickness never comes .\nFor those who lived here in Hiroshima and in Nagasaki after the nuclear attacks , no one knew who might develop cancer or other radiogenic diseases , and who would live to old age : many who never got sick spent lifetimes worrying .\nThose living where the fallout deposited from Chernobyl , from Fukushima , and from the dozens of nuclear test sites can \u2019 t be certain what their risks are , and where dangers lie .\nLiving in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress and anxiety , separate from illness .\nEveryone in such a situation worries about the health of their loved ones , especially children .\nDefenders of nuclear technologies have pathologized such anxieties , calling them \u201c radiophobia.\n\u201d This they define as an \u201c irrational \u201d fear of radiation , and present it as a mental health diagnosis .\nI argue that when long-lived radioactive particles deposit into the ecosystem where you live , and from where your food is obtained , anxiety is a rational response .\nChastising those living through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried is cruel .\nIt is victim blaming .\nPeople who find themselves downwind from nuclear fallout clouds , whether from weapon detonations or reactor accidents need support , not disdain .\nThis inclination to focus on public perceptions and relations in response to radiological contamination has been endemic throughout and since the Cold War .\nWhen former contaminated sites of U.S. nuclear weapons production are shut down , they are not simply remediated , they get a toxic make-over and are presented as pristine nature preserves .\nThe Rocky Flats Plant outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plutonium produced at Hanford and Savannah River into pits\u2014the fissile cores of nuclear weapons .\nIt was the site of multiple fires that dispersed aerosolized plutonium across wide areas .\nIn 1989 , a task force made up of officials from the FBI and the EPA conducted an unprecedented raid on the DOE facility and found mind boggling violations of environmental regulations in the routine practices at Rocky Flats .\nThe raid led to the end of pit production and the closure of the site .\nAt the time operations ceased at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plutonium onsite .\nEarly estimates outlined a 65-year remediation process that would cost almost $ 40 billion , yet , just twenty years later the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge opened to the public , sporting 18 km of hiking trails .\nWhy this cosplay ?\nWasn \u2019 t it enough to simply close down the site and keep the public out ?\nThe Colorado Front Range , where the Refuge is located , is laden with beautiful and accessible nature reserves and hiking trails .\nThe Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community .\nThis was not just done at Rocky Flats , multiple former nuclear weapon production facilities experienced rhinoplasty to be returned to society as access points to the natural world in a spectacular effort at nuclear greenwashing .\nNuclear weapon sites across the globe have also been greenwashed .\nApparently , following the remediation of the sites is the remediation of our memories .\nWriting in a 2018 report intended for internal distribution only , Roger and Linda Meade described how , \u201c When Trinity \u2019 s radioactive debris contaminated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response was to move testing to the Marshall Islands , where the seemingly empty ocean that [ sic ] would swallow any radioactive fallout .\nThis scheme worked until Bravo demonstrated that the world was not big enough to hide the radioactive fallout from thermonuclear detonations.\n\u201d 3 Throughout the history of nuclear weapon testing there has always been a careful selecting of the irradiated .\nAs pointed out above , once it was understood that the Trinity Test had spread fallout inside the United States , the U.S. moved its nuclear testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when testing resumed one year later .\nNot wanting to expose Americans to radioactive fallout , they selected the Marshallese as acceptable to irradiate .\nAll nations that tested nuclear weapons in the atmosphere made similar calculations .\nThe Soviets chose Kazakhstan as their test site , a place that First Deputy Premier Beria claimed was \u201c uninhabited.\n\u201d The Kazakhs were both ethnically and religiously different than the dominant Russian population .\nBoth the British and the French never tested one of their nuclear weapons inside their own countries ; they conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or current colonial spaces .\nThe British first tested in Australia , far from the cities populated with white Australians , on the lands of several indigenous communities .\nBecause of the scale of the fallout clouds from thermonuclear weapons , the Aussies refused to let them be tested in Australia , so the British conducted their H-bomb tests on Christmas Island in Kiribati .\nThe French first tested in Algeria while it was still a colony , and during the Algerian War of Independence .\nKnowing that they were losing the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they began to build a second site in a second colony , French Polynesia .\nThe Chinese tested in the far western Xinjiang Province , the traditional home of the Uyghur people , again , both ethnically and religiously distinct from the Han Chinese population .\nChinese hostility towards the Uyghur people continues today .\nNo nation tested nuclear weapons upwind from their own economically powerful and politically resourced populations .\nWhen the U.S. built a second test site in the continental United States it was placed amidst Native American and Hispanic communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populations in Southern Utah .\nThere was a protocol at the Nevada Test Site to not test when the wind was forecasted to blow to the south , which would carry the fallout clouds to Las Vegas and Los Angeles , but to test when the winds were forecast to blow to the east : again , selecting the irradiated.4 These decisions were made because it was clear that exposure to radioactive fallout was dangerous .\nThis was understood militarily even before the Trinity Test .\nBoth the U.S. and the Soviet military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from airplanes to kill enemy troops and contaminate enemy territory during World War Two .\nWhen the Allied forces came ashore on Normandy Beach on D-Day in 1944 , personnel carried Geiger Counters because of fears that the Nazis might have salted the beaches with uranium to contaminate and sicken the attackers .\nThe first postwar tests conducted in 1946 by the U.S. at Bikini Atoll in Operation Crossroads were an unmitigated radiological disaster .\nThe second test , the Baker Test , was detonated underwater which meant that all of the radionuclides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud and be dispersed downwind simply remained in the water of the lagoon .\nAs U.S. military personnel continued to work in the lagoon their exposure to radiation rose day after day until the Joint Task Force conducting the tests had to evacuate the 40,000 troops and scuttle the planned third test .\nThis setback still enabled a detailed and extensive study of how radionuclides move through an ecosystem on the part of marine biologists working for the Atomic Energy Commission .\nHere is a film that they produced about their work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a \u201c radiobiological laboratory.\n\u201d The top-secret 1947 report on Operation Crossroads included a chilling and clear understanding of the use of radioactive fallout as a weapon , and as a means of inducing terror in a population : \u2022 Test Baker gave evidence that the detonation of a bomb in a body of water contiguous to a city would vastly enhance its radiation effects by the creation of a base surge whose mist , contaminated with fission products , and dispersed by wind over great areas , would have not only an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long-term hazard through the contamination of structures by the deposition of radiological particles .\n\u2022 We can form no adequate mental picture of the multiple disasters which would befall a modern city , blasted by one or more atomic bombs and enveloped with radioactive mists .\nOf the survivors in contaminated areas , some would be doomed to die of radiation sickness in hours , some in days , and others in years .\nBut , these areas , irregular in size and shape , as wind and topography might form them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No survivor could be certain he was not among the doomed and so , added to every terror of the moment , thousands would be stricken with a fear of death and the uncertainty of the time of its arrival.5 There is no ambiguity in the understanding that the U.S. military had of the effects , and the military utility , of radioactive fallout immediately after the third of what would be more than 2,000 nuclear tests .\nCommunities of people affected by the radioactive fallout from U.S. ( and other nations \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being described in this report , even as the militaries that irradiated them dismissed their claims and concerns .\nThis is a question posed in the book : when is a test an attack ?\nThe massive cloud from the Bravo Test at Bikini Atoll in 1954 killed a Japanese fisherman located over 100 miles away from the hypocenter , and sickened hundreds on other fishing boats and multiple downwind atolls .\nAmerican and Soviet nuclear war planners both recognized and integrated the capacity of large fallout clouds to kill both combatants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points into nuclear targeting strategies .\nThis understanding of fallout clouds led President Kennedy to warn Americans in the fall of 1961 that the most damaging aspect of a potential Soviet nuclear attack on the U.S. would be deadly fallout clouds that extended for hundreds of miles .\nYet , Kennedy approved 96 nuclear weapon tests for the following year , including those involving thermonuclear weapons .\nThe thermonuclear tests were all kept in the Pacific to spare Americans from the deadly clouds Kennedy warned about .\nBy selecting who would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selecting who would be .\nThe Cold War was a limited nuclear war .\nSince no population was attacked directly with the weapons , and no one was subjected to the blast and heat of the detonations , it was never classified as a nuclear war .\nHowever , millions of people were subjected to radioactive fallout and had their bodies , their land and seas contaminated with radionuclides .\nThe Cold War nuclear war was limited\u2014limited to this one effect , the fallout radiation\u2014the effect that President Kennedy said \u201c could account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d 6 But residents of the Kazakh villages located 30 km from the Polygon where more than one hundred atmospheric nuclear tests were conducted , including several H-bombs ( and more than 300 underground tests ) endured ongoing attacks from the effects of nuclear weapons .\nMap of villages downwind of the Polygon in Kazakhstan .\nThe book concludes with some reframing of our understanding of nuclear waste .\nI make several arguments , the first being that we need to recognize that the deadliest of our high-level nuclear waste , the spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the most consequential thing ever produced by the human species .\nLong after our cities have crumbled , long after our languages are incomprehensible , long after our gods are dead , our spent nuclear fuel will still be here .\nSeveral hundred thousand metric tons ( currently ) of spent nuclear fuel , laden with uranium and plutonium , will still be intact and dangerous to living creatures for thousands of generations .\nIt may be how our descendants know us : the people who made the nuclear waste that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to build deep geological repositories ( DGRs ) to store this waste .\nThis means making vast containment structures half a kilometer underground that must remain intact and dry for 100,000 years .\nA great deal of scientific planning and testing is going into this effort , and using the KBS-3 method developed in Sweden , the Onkalo site in Finland will soon be placing the first spent fuel in human history into \u201c permanent \u201d storage .\nWork has been done on the geological nature of the site itself , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the spent fuel rods , and bentonite clay that will backfill the site upon completion , and multiple additional segments of the plan .\nThis is all very solid and reliable research .\nHowever , what we can grasp in a few decades of research and what eventuates over 100,000 years are unlikely to line up perfectly .\nAs for all human technological endeavors , we will probably get it a little bit right and a little bit wrong .\nTremendous research has gone into the design and operation of nuclear reactors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have operated as intended .\nBut not always .\nEven when we get it mostly right , and a little bit wrong , with technologies of this scale , and bearing risks of this magnitude , the little bit wrong part remains catastrophic .\nWhen we approach problems of this magnitude , we remain embedded in our current moment , no matter the degree to which we think we are planning long-term .\nFirstly , we made this waste with no capacity to dispose of it .\nNow that we are proceeding with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect this limited perspective .\nMultiple countries that have begun construction of DGRs , and others in advanced planning stages , searched for the best locations for these millennia long repositories , and just happened to have found that the most ideal sites are already existing nuclear power plant sites , or military sites .\nOnkalo in Finland is located alongside one of Finland \u2019 s two nuclear complexes .\nSweden plans to build its DGR at one of its existing nuclear complexes .\nIn both cases , the land is already owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent on the industry .\nLocal political approval was far less contentious in such locales as they were far from industrial areas .\nWhat divine providence that the optimum sites are so convenient for local 21st century politics .\nMany nations have operated nuclear reactors , and accrued spent fuel that it must dispose of , yet not every nation is anticipated to be geologically stable for millennia .\nA clear example is Japan , which operated 54 commercial nuclear reactors before most were powered down after the Fukushima meltdowns of March 2011 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent nuclear fuel and is geologically unstable .\nIt was an earthquake that sparked the Fukushima meltdowns .\nGeologically , Japan is a spiderweb of fault lines and volcanic zones .\nThere is no good place to build a deep geological repository inside Japan .\nYet , Japan will build one because the waste was generated by \u201c Japan , \u201d a construct that is likely to be meaningless to people sharing an ecosystem with buried Japanese waste in 40,000 years .\nWill we make choices with those people in mind ?\nOr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c necessities \u201d of the politics of our current time ?\nWe all know the answer to that : we will bury our nuclear waste within the lines of our current political maps , all the while claiming we are focused on protecting future generations .\nAnother key site where we can see the dysfunction of our strategies for protecting future generations from harm from our radioactive waste is in the marking of our waste sites .\nNuclear semiotics is a field drawing expertise from multiple disciplines to strategize how to warn future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste being buried under their communities .\nSince the waste will remain dangerous beyond 100,000-years we are aware that language is not likely to be sufficient .\nAll of our plans position us as teachers and future generations as minds and feelings that need to be shaped by us from our place of wisdom .\nWe either have to sufficiently inform them about the waste using language or images , or scare them using monumental sculpture or barriers .\nWe can not grasp the most fundamental fact : that the presence of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the message .\nWe had so little consideration for their ecosystem that we buried hundreds of thousands of tons of the most toxic material we could make there ; material that only provided benefits to us .\nWe think the information we give them about this act somehow makes the act acceptable .\nI argue that any message must begin with an apology .\nWithout an apology from us for putting them in this position , why would they listen to anything else we say ?\nWhen we released massive amounts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear testing scientists used them as radioactive tracers to study the dynamics of global systems .\nThis helped us to grasp atmospheric dynamics and global ocean flows .\nOnce in the ecosystem these particles embed and migrate as do all other materials .\nWe observed the Earth function as a single ecosystem .\nA 2021 study found cesium-137 from nuclear testing in Nevada in multiple samples of honey gathered on the East Coast of the U.S. 58 years after atmospheric testing there concluded .\nThe global distribution and ubiquitous presence of these

.\nOfficial sources claim just two deaths resulted from the landslide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 23 people were killed and 80 missing .\nThe fatal landslide earlier this year is just the latest in a series of deadly disasters in Hpakant , where no mining has occurred legally since 2020 : at least three people were killed in a December 2021 landslide , while a 2020 landslide claimed 162 lives and another in 2015 killed 113 .\nMyanmar produces a wide range of high-quality gems and precious stones : jade , ruby , sapphire , spinel , diamond , tourmaline , peridot , topaz , garnet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amber and quartz .\nYet , despite the production of numerous gems , mismanagement and corruption in the industry ensure that the country remains economically underdeveloped and suffers from social and environmental deterioration .\nJade and gemstone market in Mandalay .\nImage by John Sai Luu .\nMost of the country \u2019 s gemstone-mining sites are located in conflict areas such as Kachin state \u2019 s Hpakant area and Khamti township in the Sagaing region , where ethnic minority groups are waging armed struggles against the Myanmar government .\nJade from Myanmar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prized by Chinese consumers , is primarily produced in Hpakant , a mountainous township in the northernmost part of Myanmar .\nAccording to a local charity organization in Hpakant , more than 500 people have been killed in landslides since 2015 .\nThis string of fatalities is the result of a deadly combination of corruption , poor environmental management , conflict , and economic desperation .\nAs the country battles an economic downturn and rising unemployment , people from across Myanmar flock to Hpakant hoping to scavenge gems left behind by large mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s economy is not functioning well , many people come to Hpakant , hoping to make riches from rags , \u201d says Hpakant resident Ko Sai Han .\n\u201c Dying during landslides becomes more common .\nI also have to run for my life when there \u2019 s a landslide .\nPeople are betting on their lives while searching for gemstones at the dumpsite .\nThese problems will continue as long as there is mining .\nThe gemstone mines in Myanmar only benefit a handful of people but not the local people like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myanmar Gems and Jewelry Enterprise , there were 21,000 gemstone mines in Hpakant and Khamti .\nIn Hpakant alone , there are more than 500 companies mining using heavy machinery .\nCompanies use heavy machinery at jade mining sites in Hpakant .\nImage by John Sai Luu .\nTo obtain a permit , mining companies have to pay fees to the mining ministry , as well as local authorities .\nThese fees are vary depending on the size of a concession and its estimated gem reserves .\nHowever , the exact figures are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclose how much they have paid , citing confidentiality agreements they have to sign with authorities .\nCorruption is rampant at every level in the process , and failure to pay kickbacks to the ministry and local authorities can cause unnecessary delays in getting a permit .\nMyanmar \u2019 s Mining Law requires both authorities and miners to follow specific environmental conservation protocols , but enforcement is weak .\nIn Hpakant , all mining licenses for companies expired in 2019 and 2020 .\nOfficially , the ruling junta has not granted mining licenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mining continues .\nMoreover , the Kachin Independence Army ( KIA ) , an ethnic armed organization , controls some of the mine sites in Hpakant .\nAn employee of a jade mining company , speaking on condition of anonymity for security reasons , says companies have to pay the KIA 10 % of the total profit of mining sites under its control .\nAs a result of deals like these , resource extraction is also a source of the conflict between the Myanmar army and ethnic armed groups .\n\u201c No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But some people continue mining , \u201d said another miner , also speaking on condition of anonymity .\n\u201c Now , there are only Tatmadaw [ Myanmar Armed Forces ] and KIA .\nThe mining continues under informal agreement , meaning you can continue if you have an understanding with them .\nIllegal mining was not fully regulated before .\nBut now , illegal mining has become worse.\n\u201d Regardless of the specifics of their arrangement , companies have a limited period during which they can mine .\nAs a result , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excavating mountainsides with heavy machinery , carving out massive man-made valleys and discarding the waste into huge piles .\nThe speed and scale at which companies operate not only causes environmental damage , but also means that even high-quality gems may be missed , making these mining dumpsites a tempting target for scavengers .\nIn addition to the environmental problems it causes , the jade mining boom in Hpakant has brought with it a host of social and public health problems .\nIllegal drugs such as heroin , methamphetamines and opium are easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is recreational , but the use of stimulants and analgesics allows miners and scavengers to endure long , brutal stints searching for gems .\nIntravenous drug use is also a driver of HIV transmission .\n\u201c Drugs are easy to find in Hpakant , just as jade is , \u201d said a Hpakant resident , who also requested anonymity .\n\u201c Many people got addicted while using drugs for fun .\nBefore , local organizations against drug abuse could do actions against drug abuse .\nBut now with pandemic and political instability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drug problems will continue as long as there are gemstone mines.\n\u201d Excessive mining of jade has caused occasional landfalls and sinkholes in Hpakant .\nImage by John Sai Luu .\n\u201c Our area produces jade , but local people don \u2019 t benefit from jade mining , \u201d said Hpakant resident Ko Naw Aung .\n\u201c Local people made their living scavenging jade in the land dumpsite .\nThe area is far from being developed because jade mining only benefits a handful of people .\nIn fact , plenty of development works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from resource extraction .\nYears have passed , but the lives of local people remain the same.\n\u201d The same observation can be extended to the country as a whole .\nDespite its rich resources , Myanmar is struggling from both environmental deterioration and economic problems caused by conflict and a weak political system \u2014 a scenario often referred to as the resource curse .\nThe promise of wealth from gems and other natural resources has driven a cycle of conflict and instability , rather than providing employment and funding investments that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myanmar \u2019 s government stands to derive significant revenue from jade mining .\nIn addition to the share of profits agreed upon when a company is granted a mining concession , the government imposes taxes of 15-20 % on jade and gems sold at emporiums .\nAccording to the Myanmar Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative ( MEITI ) , the government received 708 billion kyat ( $ 578 million ) from jade and gems companies in the 2015-16 fiscal year .\nHowever , this likely represents just a small portion of the true value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivates companies to underreport or undervalue their production .\nMany companies evade taxes by making covert payments to regulators .\nThe profits from the industry thus go to a handful of individuals , instead of contributing to national economic growth .\nIt \u2019 s an open secret that the bulk of the revenue from jade mining and other forms of resource extraction flows into the pockets of corrupt officials and their cronies , as well as the Myanmar army and various armed non-state entities .\nDuring the period of civilian rule from 2011 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring accountability to the sector and ensure revenue from mining went into the public budget .\nFor example , in 2016 , during the Thein Sein government , officials were dismissed from the customs department and commerce ministry for allowing mining vehicles to be illegally imported to Hpakant from China .\nUnder the junta , even these small efforts have vanished .\nManual mining sites in Myanmar \u2019 s ruby heartland of Mogok .\nImage by John Sai Luu .\nThe production of jade and gems is currently in decline due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake of the 2021 coup .\nThere have been fewer international jade and gems emporiums as a result .\n\u201c The jade and gems business is slow in Myanmar , \u201d said jade and gems merchant U Win Maung .\n\u201c The major buyer is China .\nChinese buyers are pushing prices down , taking advantage of the political situation in Myanmar .\nWe don \u2019 t have many options , so we have to sell at the prices they offer.\n\u201d Jade that isn \u2019 t sold at emporiums generally ends up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mining companies evade government taxes , it doesn \u2019 t mean they aren \u2019 t paying fees for their extraction and export .\nAs mines are located in contested areas and areas controlled by the Kachin Independence Army , they have to pay fees to the KIA as well as the government-backed militias that control the smuggling routes .\nAnd Myanmar \u2019 s military and the border guard are also involved in this widespread ring of corruption .\nThe fact that Myanmar lacks the technology to produce finished products from raw jade suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to rely on China in political , economic and various other fields for decades .\nAs a consequence , Myanmar \u2019 s jade and gems industry will remain a buyer \u2019 s market for China for many more years to come .\n\u201c Among other resources , jade and gemstones generate most of the revenue , \u201d one anonymous gemstone expert said .\n\u201c Our country is a resource-producing country .\nWe need to go from producing raw materials to finished products .\nWe need to make sure the resource-extracting industry benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be built to benefit local people .\nTo do that , everyone needs to work together .\nBecause of the weak mechanism , local communities are not benefiting from

several important bilateral trade and cooperation agreements were signed during a visit from Nguyen Xuan Phuc , Vietnam \u2019 s president .\nCambodia \u2019 s trade with Vietnam was worth only $ 3.8 billion in 2017 , meaning a 144 % increase has been seen over the past five years .\nBy comparison , Cambodia \u2019 s trade with China was worth $ 11.1 billion in 2021 , up 91 % from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China and Vietnam strategic and economic competition in Cambodia has been ongoing for a long time , and will only intensify when both China and Vietnam want to maintain and strengthen their influence over Phnom Penh , \u201d said Le Hong Hiep , a senior fellow at the Vietnam Studies Program at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute .\nThe Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in late 1978 to oust the genocidal

prime minister since 1985 , was tutored by Vietnamese diplomats .\nHis ruling Cambodian People \u2019 s Party ( CPP ) was founded by Khmer Rouge defectors , including himself , who returned to Cambodia alongside Vietnamese forces to oust the genocidal regime in January 1979 .\nBut Vietnam \u2019 s leverage over Cambodia waned in the 1990s , as the country normalized its international relations .\nThe US and Japan were key partners in that decade .\nBy the early 2010s , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today , Cambodia is regarded as Beijing \u2019 s most loyal partner in Southeast Asia .\nThis competition between China and Vietnam for influence \u201c will be a good thing for Cambodia as long as it can maintain a fine balance between the two neighbors , \u201d he added .\nBy one logic , 21st-century geopolitics is shaped by trade .\nIt has , for some , become more \u201c geoeconomics \u201d than geopolitics : countries that trade heavily with both the US and China don \u2019 t want to pick sides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds difficulty with Cambodia , which has swung towards Beijing , and massively away from the US , in recent years .\nPhnom Penh has not only cut military ties with the US , but also accused Washington of plotting a coup with the now-banned opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party ( CNRP ) .\nElite opinion in Cambodia is massively shifting towards China .\nIn the latest State of Southeast Asia survey , released annually by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute , respondents were asked if ASEAN was forced to align itself with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US or China , which one should it choose ?\nSome 81.5 % of Cambodian respondents reckon the regional bloc should choose China over the US .\nOnly 46.2 % said China in the 2021 survey .\nWhat \u2019 s more , 25.9 % of Cambodian respondents now see China as \u201c a benign and benevolent power , \u201d compared with only 3.8 % last year .\nIf Cambodia-Vietnam trade becomes more on par with Cambodia-China trade , can Phnom Penh be expected to take more into consideration Hanoi \u2019 s geopolitical sensibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Beijing \u2019 s ?\nBoth Vietnam and China contest the same territory in the South China Sea .\nChinese aggression against Vietnam has ratcheted up in recent years .\nYet most analysts don \u2019 t think Phnom Penh is about to suddenly steer its interests away from Beijing and closer to Hanoi because of trade .\nThe Cambodia-Vietnam Friendship Monument in Phnom Penh has been vandalized a number of times over the years .\nPhoto : WikiCommons \u201c The recent increase in trade reflects the regional economic integration and the level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don \u2019 t think it can change the current course of Cambodian alignment with Beijing , \u201d said Nguyen Khac Giang , an analyst at the Victoria University of Wellington .\nThe capacity for increasing influence is there , he added , noting that some of Vietnam \u2019 s largest companies , such as the military-run Viettel conglomerate , have a big presence in the Cambodian economy .\n\u201c But I \u2019 m not convinced Hanoi can win over China in Cambodia , \u201d Giang added .\nAccording to some , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game for Phnom Penh to scale back its associations with Beijing .\n\u201c If China actually is building a naval base at Ream and military-grade airfield at Dara Sakor , then that strongly suggests it has the inside track on Vietnam regardless of the economic angle , \u201d said Derek Grossman , a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation .\nHe was referring to allegations that have been made since 2018 , including by US officials , that Cambodia is planning to allow China to use its naval base near the coastal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penh denies .\nAnd then there \u2019 s the much more complicated question of local politics .\nPutting it politely , the Vietnamese are not well-liked in Cambodia , in part because of the Vietnamese occupation of the country after 1979 , when Hanoi \u2019 s troops invaded to oust the genocidal Khmer Rouge .\nThat animosity goes back further in history .\nAfter the fall of the Khmer Empire in the 15th century , Cambodia was constantly threatened by its neighbors , Siam and Vietnam .\nInvasions were launched and Cambodia only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either side .\nThe government of Hun Sen , which has been in power since 1979 , and was essentially installed by Hanoi , is still often accused of being a Vietnamese puppet .\nThe now-banned CNRP , the main opposition party , made much political capital by railing against the influence of the yuon , a racist term in Cambodia for the Vietnamese .\nA large number of Vietnamese communities in Cambodia , like this one on the Bassac River , have been forced to relocate .\nPhoto : WikiCommons Kimkong Heng @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cambodia Development Center , wrote in a recent essay for ISEAS that impediments to Cambodia-Vietnam relations remain .\nOne is land demarcation , a hot-button political issue in Cambodia as certain politicians claim the Vietnamese are still trying to encroach on Cambodian territory .\nOnly 84 % of their 1,270-kilometer border has been officially demarcated .\nAnother problem is ethnic Vietnamese migrants .\nHeng referenced a claim that there are between 400,000 and 700,000 ethnic Vietnamese in the country , of whom about 90 % have no birth certificates or identity cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less hostile to ethnic Vietnamese than some opposition parties , the government has still carried out forced relocations of entire Vietnamese communities .\nThere are two other things to watch out for .\nFirst , whether the US \u2013 which has come down hard on Cambodia in recent years at the same time as exerting much effort to gain leverage in Vietnam \u2013 will lobby Hanoi to use its influence in Phnom Penh to alter the Cambodian government \u2019 s geopolitical interests .\nCambodia and Vietnam loom large over Washington \u2019 s Southeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choices .\nW Patrick Murphy , the US ambassador to Phnom Penh , was previously the acting deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs .\nDaniel J Kritenbrink , who now occupies that role , was ambassador to Vietnam between 2017 and 2021 .\nThe second is whether the Vietnamese government tries to win over the younger Cambodian officials who are expected to move up the ranks when Hun Manet , Hun Sen \u2019 s eldest son , succeeds his father as prime minister sometime this decade , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambodia \u2019 s ruling party agreed to this dynastic handover and Manet was tasked with forming a \u201c reserve cabinet \u201d around him .\nCambodia \u2019 s position between China and Vietnam might undergo some changes as Manet \u2019 s dynastic succession slowly develops .\nIt is likely to take on more formal pretenses after next year \u2019 s general election at which Manet is likely to be made a cabinet minister and take on more active political duties .\nThis could go two ways , Heng wrote in his recent essay .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ prime minister and follows in his father \u2019 s footsteps to consolidate power and maintain stability in Cambodia \u2019 s ties with its neighbors , Cambodia and Vietnam are likely to remain on good terms , \u201d Heng said .\nBut if Manet was to introduce political reforms and embrace liberal democracy , Cambodia-Vietnam relations \u201c will take a new direction.\n\u201d A Manet-led ruling party may attempt to compete with the opposition parties in their anti-Vietnamese

going to be washed away from rising sea levels caused by global warming then this is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existential one.\n\u201d Despite such remarks , the Morrison government remained deaf .\nIn 2020 , it was still hostile to the idea of committing to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 .\nFourteen Pacific leaders responded by penning an open letter to the Prime Minister .\nMade up of former presidents , prime ministers , archbishops and church leaders , the authors took issue with Australia \u2019 s \u201c current Paris Agreement emission reduction target \u201d as \u201c one of the weakest among wealthy nations.\n\u201d The letter condemned Canberra \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c which legally can not , and morally should not , be used to meet Australia \u2019 s 2030 Paris Agreement target \u201d .\nAs the children and grandchildren of the region faced \u201c unprecedented risks due to climate change , now is the time to stand together and work together to secure their future safety and prosperity.\n\u201d Wilful blindness to the region on the subject of climate security has persisted , with Dutton , now Defence Minister , adamant that Canberra had \u201c a fantastic relationship with the Solomon Islands \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of \u201c the Pacific family , \u201d which presumably is made up of hectoring parents and obedient children , who the children are is never in doubt .\n\u201c As part of the Pacific family , it is obvious we want to work together and we want to resolve the issues within that family , within our region.\n\u201d Some issues are just bigger than others .\nWhile Wong and Plibersek are trying to squeeze every bit of critical comment about the Sino-Solomon Islands pact , it was only one aspect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smaller states in the region .\nIn all the fuss and angst about the Honiara-Beijing agreement and whether it would permit the stationing of Chinese military personnel , the Pacific Elders \u2019 Voice had to reiterate \u201c that the primary security threat to the Pacific is climate change.\n\u201d The group also recalled the content of the 2018 Boe Declaration on Regional Security : \u201c We affirm that climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods , security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific and our commitments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agreement.\n\u201d For the elders , the major powers \u201c including the US , Japan and Australia , are developing strategies and policies for the \u2018 Indo-Pacific \u2019 with little , if any , consultation with the Pacific Island countries.\n\u201d The Pacific region comprising states \u2013 known as the Moana \u2013 faced \u201c a set of unique challenges.\n\u201d It was primarily those countries , not external powers , who should determine the security and future of the region .\nAccordingly , all nations were called upon \u201c to respect the sovereignty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of Pacific peoples to develop and implement their own security strategies without undue coercion from outsiders.\n\u201d The observation is well-reasoned and well-meant ; but those same external powers , goggle-eyed about nuclear-powered submarines , the establishment of rival military bases and geopolitical strutting , have long ignored the sovereign wishes of those in the Pacific .\nIt is a nasty habit that persists , even as sea

Frydenberg is nervous .\nThere is also reason to suggest that he might even be panicking .\nThe electorate he represents \u2013 that of Kooyong \u2013 is not quite so warm towards the sitting member as it has been in the past .\nThe sitting MP has resorted to his home party base for comfort .\n\u201c Incredible sea of Liberal blue at our Kooyong Campaign Launch , with more than 1,000 people

.\nAfter voicing public approval for Frydenberg ( \u201c Liberals will win because of Josh \u201d ) , volunteer Phil Elwood proceeded to become an impromptu \u201c birdman \u201d , imitating the sound of a Kookaburra and Sulphur-crested Cockatoo with gusto .\nMany political candidates have feared the distractions of the eccentric , dedicated supporter .\nThe seat has also been given licks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posters , placards and paraphernalia saturating the suburb .\nBut all this extravagant expense of reminder in a seat traditionally held by the Liberals , there is a nagging feeling that a rude shock awaits on May 21 .\nThat rude shock comes in the form of independent candidate Monique Ryan .\n\u201c A vote for Dr Monique Ryan , \u201d runs the standard line , \u201c is a vote for climate action , integrity and a strong economy.\n\u201d From her perspective , and those of similar candidates in other safe Liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Sydney \u2013 the first two priorities , which have tended to find their way at the bottom end of the government \u2019 s list , stand out .\nThe Morrison government has made a name for itself in the field of corruption and a lack of accountability verging on the grotesque .\nIts members have shown little contrition on being exposed .\nIn December 2020 , when it was revealed that Morrison and Frydenberg had run up a bill of almost $ 5,000 for

the case for the \u201c teal independents \u201d , who are insisting that the Liberal Party account for its sins and call out scandals and sleaze .\nThey also support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something which , according to a poll conducted by The Australia Institute , is endorsed by three in four Australians .\nThe momentum of such candidates has caused an outbreak of sweat among the sitting members .\nFrydenberg , for one , has resorted to attacking Ryan in a coarse , personal way .\nA central strategy , one fabulously juvenile and ill-informed , is to assume that an independent candidate can

.\nShe could not have been a swinging voter , but instead an unwavering member of a tribe from the outset .\nThis ossified veneration of the unchanging political mind came to the fore in remarks made

has been reviled as ugly , noisy and unendearing by a certain number of prominent figures .\nFormer Prime Minister Tony Abbott pathologized them , calling wind turbines the \u201c dark satanic mills of the modern era \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaging to health .\nThe latter view has been rejected by the National Health and Medical Research Council , which found \u201c no consistent evidence that wind

Literature examining the nature of wind farm complaints also notes \u201c large historical and geographical differences in the distribution of complainants in Australia.\n\u201d Current Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce is another figure who never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of wind power .\nIn New South Wales , where his electorate is based , he has warned the NSW government to \u201c be careful \u201d about using more turbines .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not a bowl of cherries in this space , \u201d the Nationals leader gnomically observed , \u201c and that \u2019 s why you \u2019 ve got to keep your base load power going.\n\u201d This has placed him at odds with the State government and its renewable energy agenda .\nCriticism of the New England renewable energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sea of wind farms \u201d did not impress NSW agriculture minister Adam Marshall in December 2020 .\nIn The Land newspaper , Marshall , who is also a member of the Nationals , regarded such criticism as \u201c banal and binary and prehistoric \u201d .\nOn March 25 , the Victorian Supreme Court gave private citizens some cause for joy , and policy makers and corporations a potential cause for concern , in challenging the way such farms operate .\nThe judgement found that the noise from the Bald Hills Wind Farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c caused substantial interference with both plaintiffs \u2019 enjoyment of their land \u2013 specifically , their ability to sleep undisturbed at night , in their own beds in their own homes.\n\u201d There had been a sufficient nuisance to warrant the awarding of damages and an injunction on the company from continuing to cause the noise at night , Bald Hills having failed to establish \u201c that the sound received at either [ the plaintiffs \u2019 houses ] complied with noise conditions in the permit at any time.\n\u201d While the relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action \u201d , it was up to the court or tribunal to determine whether compliance had taken place .\nThe two individuals in question \u2013 John Zakula and Noel Uren \u2013 sued the wind farm in 2021 claiming the infliction of \u201c roaring \u201d noise by the wind turbines .\nIt transpires that Bald Hills had form of the most condescending sort .\nSince commencing operations in 2015 , it had received \u201c many complaints from neighbouring residents and landowners about noise from wind turbines.\n\u201d In 2015 alone , the Bald Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Uren and Zakula , and all about noise disruption .\nThe company \u2019 s behaviour in responding to the complaints did not impress the court .\nJustice Melinda Richards decided that awarding aggravated damages was entirely appropriate .\n\u201c The manner in which Bald Hills dealt with the plaintiffs \u2019 reasonable and legitimate complaints of noise , over many years , at least doubled the impact of the loss of amenity each of them suffered at their homes.\n\u201d The judge decided that Uren should receive $ 46,000 in aggravated damages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice Richards was not amiss to the implications of such a decision .\nUnlike the Australian Deputy Prime Minister , she showed no signs of pre-historic tendencies in her reasoning .\nWind power generation , she accepted , was \u201c a socially beneficial activity \u201d .\nThere was no reason , however , why it was not \u201c possible to achieve both a good night \u2019 s sleep and power generation at the same time.\n\u201d The evidence presented to the court \u201c did not suggest [ \u2026 ] that there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation of clean energy by the wind farm , and a good night \u2019 s sleep for its neighbours.\n\u201d The company could well have responded to the complaints of Uren and Zakula adequately \u201c while continuing to generate renewable energy.\n\u201d When seen in its more specific context , the decision furnishes the renewable energy sector with a critical lesson .\nEven when engaged in socially responsible activities \u2013 in this case , renewable energy production \u2013 companies must be mindful of the implications of their behaviour to neighbouring residents .\nBeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but hardly enough when it comes to inflicting a nightmare upon residents .\nDominica Tannock , representing both plaintiffs , suggested after her clients \u2019 victory that , \u201c The implications are corporate Australia will have to be very careful about complaints.\n\u201d It was incumbent on the company to behave reasonably , fairly and \u201c protect people \u2019 s sleep and if they don \u2019

downplayed .\nMany people are buying this electoral propaganda which is being perpetuated on Facebook , Twitter , TikTok and YouTube by an army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp .\nBesides being a direct descendant

106 billion , or 2 % of its gross domestic product ( GDP ) .\nThis move \u2013 like recent pledges by Germany to massively increase its military spending in the wake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings the country full circle since it was militarily neutered following defeat in the second world war .\nJapan \u2019 s Liberal Democrat government said the decision , which it announced at the end of April , had been prompted by the conflict in Ukraine , but also reflected growing regional pressure from China , North Korea and Russia .\nDefense minister Nobuo Kishi said the increase in spending was designed to give Japan \u201c counterstrike capabilities \u201d to defend against aggression in the region .\nThe US has been pressuring Japan for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share the security bill in the Asia-Pacific region .\nDoubling its defense budget brings Japan in line with the benchmark for NATO countries \u2019 military spending and positions Japan increasingly more as a genuine ally , rather than dependent , of the US in the region \u2013 a position it has held since American occupation forces drafted a \u201c pacifist \u201d constitution to prevent any recurrence of Japanese imperial ambitions .\nThe constitution prohibited the use of force and the maintenance of armed forces , despite the later creation of Japan \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was thereafter combined with a notional 1 % of GDP cap on defense spending , as well as three non-nuclear principles banning nuclear weapons being \u201c produced , possessed or permitted entry.\n\u201d To this day , the constitution and its anti-militarist Article 9 remain unchanged .\nBut Japan is pacifist in name only .\nThe process of Japan \u2019 s remilitarization has been going on since the immediate postwar period .\nBut the timing and rationale behind this latest move are significant .\nSince its rise to international prominence after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sino-Japanese war ( 1895 ) , Japan has gone through a series of foreign policy shifts .\nThese have fluctuated dramatically , from imperial aggressor ( 1930s ) to pacifist ( 1950s ) and middle power ( 2000s ) .\nIn the current era , relations with Washington have been paramount .\nBut with America seemingly overstretched and in decline , Tokyo \u2019 s move to strengthen its military and deepen the alliance poses questions about Japan \u2019 s security identity .\nIt also raises concerns of entrapment into American proxy wars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military-industrial complex \u201d , the system by which the defense sector encourages arms spending and war .\nThe latest rise in defense spending is combined with deepening interoperability between US military units and the JSDF .\nIt also paves the way for Japan to contribute billions of dollars to an arms and security infrastructure industry that is booming in the wake of Russia \u2019 s invasion into Ukraine .\nAll this while Article 9 of the constitution remains unaltered in Japanese law .\nOn paper this supposedly maintains a so-called \u201c cap in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since changes to the constitution \u2019 s interpretation ratified in 2015 , Japan \u2019 s foreign policy has increasingly resembled that of a great power .\nJapan \u2019 s Special Defense Forces could become more offensive with a change of the constitution .\nImage : Facebook Today , Japan is fervently supporting the Biden administration \u2019 s package of punitive sanctions against Russia and increased aid to Ukraine .\nThis includes further attempts to justify what already seemingly amount to violations of Article 9 .\nJapan \u2019 s military spending ( already the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradicts the clause .\nRemarkably , the JSDF also now has permanent operations bases as far away as the Horn of Africa .\nAnd the Japanese defense ministry is effectively supplying logistical materials to Ukrainian forces in a combat zone .\nThe key point of concern here is that Article 9 , the 1 % GDP defense budget cap and non-nuclear principles combined to allay the fears of regional powers that Japan might attempt to return to its colonial past .\nDomestic debate over whether the clause should be reformed or scrapped has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian conquests , including China , resolutely oppose constitutional reform .\nArticle 9 \u2019 s malleable reinterpretation , therefore , reflects Japan \u2019 s tricky position between Asia and the US .\nThis is compounded by the political capriciousness of prime minister , Fumio Kishida .\nTouted as a liberal , his foreign policy has become almost as hawkish as his conservative predecessors .\nAnd he now leans towards a relationship so close to the US that it risks entanglement in overseas conflicts .\nTokyo \u2019 s increasingly well-funded military , backed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaves no doubt as to the robust transformation of Japanese forces in material terms .\nBut the question remains as to whether China \u2019 s rise and North Korea \u2019 s saber-rattling really amount to the \u201c dangerous \u201d and \u201c dynamic \u201d security environmentbeing used to justify these changes .\nThis is a question of identity as well as practicality .\nJapan should be clear about its regional and global roles .\nIt has the third-largest economy , the ninth most expensive military and significant influence across many leading international institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYet almost half the Japanese public are against revising Article 9 .\nThey are proud of Japan \u2019 s peaceful society and certainly do not seek expansion or entanglement in American wars .\nThat was , at least , until now .\nBy invoking suffering in Ukraine , Japan \u2019 s government and mainstream media appear to have hit upon a means by which to transform sympathy into action backed by popular support .\nTokyo has ramped up refugee intakes to unprecedented numbers , donations to Ukraine have dramatically increased and military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western allies .\nIntuitively , this may seem like a positive indicator of how Japan would respond to a contingency closer to home , such as Chinese aggression directed towards Taiwan .\nIn reality , however , this shift in Japan \u2019 s foreign policy should be cause for concern , for it risks stoking future conflicts .\nAs Beijing stalks Taipei in the wake of Moscow invading Ukraine , Japan

Ukraine , United States President Joe Biden and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison have demanded Russia be excluded from the Group of Twenty ( G20 ) annual meeting in Bali in November this year .\nThis demand has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; since the beginning of the military invasion , Indonesia has taken a soft stance on Russia .\nUntil now , Indonesia has not imposed any sanctions against Russia , nor is it likely to do so .\nThe country has clearly and firmly announced its position : to invite all G20 country leaders , with no exception , to come to Bali for the meeting .\nDespite mounting criticisms , we believe Indonesia has taken the right decision to still invite Russia and resist demands from the US and its allies ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not appear the best course of action .\nHere is why .\nRussia has been expelled before This will not be first time for Russia to be expelled from an international forum .\nThe Group of Eight ( G8 ) \u2013 now the G7 \u2013 expelled Russia from the forum over its annexation of Crimea .\nIn 2014 , Russia took over the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine with Putin saying this was to protect the well-being of eastern Ukrainian citizens .\nThis stirred global condemnation , Russia was hit with economic sanctions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctions apparently did not deter Russia ; Crimea remains under its control .\nRussia doesn \u2019 t seem to be bothered about violating international law .\nViolating international law typically leads to two types of sanctions : direct sanctions ( such as economic sanctions ) and reputational sanctions ( targeting the reputation of the offender ) .\nExclusion from the G20 would mostly be a reputational sanction for Russia , not a direct sanction , as the country has been mostly cut off from the global economy anyway .\nAny exclusion from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia \u2019 s already tarnished global reputation , and will only have limited economic impact .\nWhile direct and reputational sanctions may be useful to deter potential offenders , they are less useful for punishing repeat offenders , particularly if they have proven to be ineffective in the past .\nLike employing economic sanctions ( which tends to be unsuccessful ) , expelling Russia from the G20 is merely doing the same thing over again but expecting different results .\nFurthermore , since the G20 is a forum , not an international organisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal membership .\nThe expulsion of a member state needs to be collectively agreed by all members .\nThus , it may be difficult to expel Russia from the forum considering China , India and South Africa \u2019 s continued soft stance on Russia .\nAs host of the G20 summit this year , the Indonesian government has decided to still invite President Putin and has said it would maintain impartiality .\nThis may come as a surprise given Indonesia \u2019 s disapproval of military action in Ukraine and its support for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the withdrawal of Russian troops .\nHowever , Indonesia \u2019 s disapproval of Russia \u2019 s actions does not mean Indonesia supports the position of the Western nations .\nRather , it shows Indonesia has been consistent to implement its \u201c free and active foreign policy \u201d .\nFree means Indonesia is independent and does not side with any world powers , while active means Indonesia would take the initiative in a peace settlement .\nThis is a high-level task , and it is the responsibility of President Joko \u201c Jokowi \u201d Widodo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both camps and convince them of Indonesia \u2019 s impartial position .\nIndonesia has experience as a regional facilitator and mediator in Southeast Asian conflicts and can use this expertise to mediate the group \u2019 s polarisation .\nEven if Indonesia can not manage to handle this polarisation by November , it can still offer a side-line meeting for Russia-Ukraine peace talks during the summit , as President Biden has suggested .\nG20 as Russia \u2019 s way out In a way , the G20 forum can function as Russia \u2019 s way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without losing face .\nRussia has continuously claimed this war as a special operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine .\nDemilitarisation of Ukraine may be plausible , but de-Nazification seems a bit far-fetched ; Ukraine is not a fully democratic country , but it is hardly an autocratic one .\nRussia is in a tight spot and pushing Putin to the limit may not end well .\nRussia is stuck in a dilemma of continuing the war , with human loss , material damage and economic recession .\nYet , admitting defeat can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even downfall \u2013 of Putin \u2019 s regime .\nNeither scenario is favourable for him .\nTherefore , President Putin can use the G20 forum to hold meetings with other world leaders .\nThis could be a gesture to the world that he wants to end the war and focus on more crucial issues , such as economic recovery and climate change .\nNote to readers : Please

that began with Cathy McGowan , the Victorian independent who won the rural seat of Indi in 2013 .\nThis was also an election which delivered the highest Greens vote ever .\nQueensland , almost always

Macatumbalen in the western Philippines \u2019 Palawan province .\n\u201c In our agroforestry site , we had planted different species like banana , bamboo , breadfruit , lanzones and rambutan , \u201d Tablason says .\n\u201c Most of them fell down.\n\u201d The sounds of birds and other wild animals that once greeted him in the forest have also gone , replaced with an eerie silence reminiscent of the heydays of commercial logging in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transitions to a new administration , no help seems to be coming from Manila , forcing the people of Macatumbalen to rely on themselves to get back on their feet and restore the forests and their livelihoods .\nOnce a logger himself , 53-year-old Tablason leads men in clearing debris from trails using a government-registered chainsaw .\nThe area \u2019 s natural forests were massively degraded by commercial logging that started in the 1980s .\nRespite came in 1991 when logging was banned across the entire country .\nIn 1997 , locals began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Coastal Management Association , and in 2002 they were granted a 25-year agreement to conserve , protect and sustainably use 1,850 hectares ( 4,571 acres ) of forest .\nThis agreement came under the Philippines \u2019 Community-Based Forest Management ( CBFM ) program , an approach formalized by executive order in 1995 as part of a national strategy for achieving sustainable

posted at least 85 % survival rates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres ) of denuded forestland in Macatumbalen .\nAlthough project funding ended in 2019 , the Macatumbalen community , nationally awarded for its exemplary forestry practices , continued enriching the forests with indigenous tree species , especially in the area where its watershed sits .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve also self-initiated reforestation , aside from the ones we implemented with the local and national government , so that helped in forest regeneration , \u201d Collado says .\n\u201c The old logging roads closed as a result .\nThe denuded forestland was restored and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed on Dec. 17 , 2021 , when Typhoon Rai made its ninth and final landfall in the Philippines , hitting northern Palawan .\nThe storm struck a blow not only to the forests the villagers had worked to revive , but also to the forest-dependent enterprises that had sustained them for decades .\nFor the Macatumbalen villagers , this large swath of forestland , the size of nearly 3,500 football fields , is a wellspring of life .\nThe forests provide clean air and water , and also sustain the community with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as honey , rattan , fruits and dammar resin , known locally as almaciga , which they sell at local markets to support their families .\nTheir access to these forest products is enshrined in the CBFM agreement the

and in order to better flesh out important points of convergence and divergence between them , the articles in this special issue are not ordered geographically , chronologically , or according to well-established sites and binaries , but within three general , though overlapping , themes : ( 1 ) sites of mourning , ( 2 ) personal narratives , and ( 3 ) commemoration and memorialization .\nJay Winter popularized the term \u201c sites of mourning \u201d in his pioneering study of personal grief and thecommemoration the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nModern nation states were unique in that they mobilized individual civilians to fight and die in their wars .\nTo justify these actions , states created the \u201c myth of the war experience \u201d which often beautified and gave meaning to private citizens \u2019 war deaths for the nation ( Mosse 1990 , 7 ) .\nBut the task from the outset was beset by an inherent tension and contradiction : the dual competing desires to publicly commemorate and to privately mourn .\nBy managing memories of the war dead through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states were partly able to instrumentalize and channel private grief over lost loved ones into patriotic affect and nationalism .\nYet personal sadness and suffering ( Acton 2007 ; Choi 2001 ) , including that expressed through resistance ( Figal 2018 ; Fryer et al .\n2021 ) , often clashed with states \u2019 inherent need to beautify and heroize war in support of national aims .\nAs contributions in this special issue reveal , this tension has been most clearly apparent when bereaved family members and veterans negotiated with the state over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war dead .\nThe arena for such negotiations , moreover , have included numerous \u201c sites , \u201d especially cemeteries for the war dead and at former battlefields where slain soldiers \u2019 remains lay fallen .\nArticles in this special issue highlight such sites of mourning not only as spaces where personal grief becomes highly politicized , but also as potential transnational sites of either geopolitical dispute or reconciliation .\nFirst , Collin Rusneac explores the notion of the national war cemetery as a transnational space of mourning , education , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war cemeteries , one within Japan \u2019 s national borders in Osaka , and the other outside , in Malaysia .\nThrough his focus on these two sites , he posits an alternative to Japan \u2019 s national memorial landscape which is often dominated by the Yasukuni Shrine .\nWhile Japan has an official commemorative infrastructure , it is relatively decentralized and disjointed .\nAccordingly , Japanese war cemeteries built either inside Japan or elsewhere rely on local operational infrastructure .\nAs Rusneac shows , this has allowed for a variety of commemorative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s wartime and imperial past away from the hegemonic narrative and political controversies of Japan \u2019 s more well-known sites of mourning .\nThe role of war cemeteries as sites of transnationalism and diplomacy is further developed in Alison Starr \u2019 s discussion of dual Japanese and Australian war cemeteries in Cowra , Australia .\nThese cemeteries were originally built to inter over two-hundred Japanese and five Australians who died due to a breakout by Japanese prisoners from the nearby POW camp but were extended to include civilian and military Japanese who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Starr explains , town leaders and visiting Japanese officials have developed these cemeteries and a series of interlinked memorial spaces and events to transform Cowra more widely into a space of grief and reconciliation for veterans , locals , and diplomats , and as a site of domestic and international tourism and binational diplomacy .\nWhile cemeteries are emblematic sites of mourning for grieving veterans and public , Beatrice Trefalt \u2019 s article reminds us that former battle sites present another realm of mourning with immediacy especially to veterans and the bereaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanings in visual representations of sites of mourning , Trefalt highlights acts of collective remembrance that help us understand what groups of people are trying to achieve , both politically and personally , when they act in public to conjure up the past .\nAt the heart of her analysis is a photographic book compiled by a group of Japanese veterans who embarked on a bone collecting trip to New Guinea in 1969 .\nExploring how the book is designed to elicit emotional responses in the reader , Trefalt highlights the role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to arrest the forgetting of the war dead and of campaigns in the war not canonized in collective memory .\nArticles in this section explore how the personal narratives of wartime survivors attempt to reconcile their experiences , memories , and senses of \u201c self \u201d against officially sanctioned remembrances .\nVarious studies have highlighted both the importance of cognitively ordering individual experiences , i.e.\n, memories , into coherent narratives for the construction and assertion of self-identity ( Hunt 2010 ) , and the necessity of transforming memories into narrative form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cross-generational transmission ( Assmann 2008 ) .\nMoreover , wartime survivors have often been compelled by a \u201c need to narrate , \u201d not only to repair a psyche and identity fractured by traumatic past experiences , but also from various feelings of either obligation to the dead or other forms of \u201c survivor guilt \u201d ( Aukema 2016 ) .\nWorking their experiences into coherent narratives frequently allows wartime survivors to make sense of and provide meaning to the past .\nOne of the most common ways wartime survivors have narrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For centuries literature , fictional or otherwise , has provided a means for individuals to articulate and represent the subjective and emotional aspects of war that are often masked by official histories and impersonal statistical data .\nIn the modern era , diary writing became a nearly universalized tool for soldiers to record their battlefield experiences .\nThese often provided the raw material for many subsequent veterans \u2019 literary writings and tales ( senkimono in Japanese ) in the postwar ( Moore 2013 ) .\nSoldiers \u2019 written narratives were highly complex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingo from the era which seemingly glorified war on the one hand , with often brutal and horrifically vivid descriptions of battle , and at times probing accounts of personal responsibility on the other ( Takahashi 1988 ; Yoshida 2005 ; Yoshida 2011 ) .\nThe mass-mobilization of total war meant that civilians also wrote about the Asia-Pacific War .\nJapan \u2019 s atomic-bomb literature as well as \u201c war experience writings \u201d ( sens\u014d taiken kiroku ) are notable examples .\nThe diversity of war experience writings makes generalized statements about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet , as essays in this special issue remind us , it is perhaps more helpful to investigate each individual work as a unique attempt to situate the authors \u2019 personal experiences in the context of the broader social construction of memory .\nNot all wartime narratives are written down or published , however .\nOral narratives voiced within familial or friendship groups or in public , such as when wartime survivors and victims give speeches or open testimony , are also significant forms of war narrative .\nStories told within families , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the intergenerational transmission of wartime memories , and have enabled generations of \u201c post-memory \u201d wherein survivors \u2019 children internalize their parents \u2019 or relatives \u2019 memories as their own ( Hirsch 1992 ) .\nPost-memories of war and atrocity , some have argued , can remain so strong in society that they even live on as kinds of cultural trauma ( Hashimoto 2015 ) .\nOral histories can also shed invaluable light on hitherto unexplored or neglected aspects of the past , and can either challenge or reaffirm dominant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past ( Perks 1998 ) .\nThe academic researcher , too , through the process of recording and documenting oral histories , shares in this production process , and published oral-history compilations continue to inform our understanding of the Asia-Pacific War ( e.g.\n, Cook and Cook 2000 ) .\nEssays in this section explore these and other multifaceted aspects of Asia-Pacific War memories as expressed through personal narratives and literature .\nFirst , Justin Aukema \u2019 s article compares war-themed literary works written by two Japanese veterans Furukawa Shigemi and Kamiko Kiyoshi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their Cold War-era presents , both authors deployed what Aukema identifies as a kind of literary \u201c modernization theory \u201d whereby they attributed the Japanese defeat to the pervasive feudal mindset of the Imperial Japanese Army ( IJA ) .\nThis message is symbolically emphasized and illustrated by the stories \u2019 protagonists , Japanese soldiers whose disgust with what they see as the IJA \u2019 s outdated tactics and ethos leads them to desert mid-battle .\nIn this way , Aukema argues , the novel \u2019 s protagonists function as what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while their military desertion would have been considered shameful during the war , they were justified post hoc in the postwar when Japan \u2019 s military apparatus and empire were thoroughly disgraced and denounced .\nThe ultimate objective of the anti-hero hero , therefore , in this milieu , is not to decry the horror of war , but rather to recast Japan \u2019 s substantial wartime defeat as a symbolic victory of the forces of \u201c modernity \u201d over those of a discredited feudalism-militarism .\nWhile Aukema focuses on the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for national rehabilitation , Ry\u014dta Nishino \u2019 s article illustrates the potential of the memoir to bring psychological healing to an individual veteran .\nNishino , in his analysis of the writings of the Japanese veteran and memoirist , Ogawa Masatsugu , traces the personal trauma of war .\nFor Japanese troops and other defeated soldiers coming to terms with the shift from winning to losing a war in which psychology , war memoir and life history converge was a difficult undertaking .\nThrough tracing his initial personal trauma in China to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s memoir highlights an inner struggle between that of victim and perpetrator that troubled many veterans in Japan and elsewhere .\nMeanwhile , Matthew Allen looks at another personal struggle : this one a veteran-author \u2019 s grudge against the cynical ethos of the IJA .\nHis source for textual analysis is Maetani Koremitsu \u2019 s 1962 comic , Robotto tokk\u014dtai , whose protagonist , Robotto , is a clumsy robot who unwittingly joins Japan \u2019 s infamous unit of \u201c kamikaze \u201d Special Attack Force ( tokk\u014dtai ) pilots .\nWhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the war and by nationalists in the postwar , Maetani critically mocks this image through his humorous portrayals of Robotto \u2019 s follies .\nNamely , Robotto proves time and time again , often quite humorously , incapable of carrying out his \u201c sacred \u201d duty to sacrifice his life for nation and emperor .\nYet the humor works because this military ethos was indeed discredited in the postwar period .\nIn this way , Allen shows how Maetani \u2019 s Robotto character was not only an \u201c anti-hero hero \u201d but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c post-memory \u201d by portraying the war itself as a tragic farce .\nThus , he proposes the idea of \u201c counter-post-memory \u201d instead to characterize such works as Maetani \u2019 s .\nAdditionally , Elena Kolesova and Kanazawa Mutsumi highlight important aspects of women \u2019 s experiences of war and its aftermath .\nThe authors ask how Japanese war brides in New Zealand responded to the challenges of international marriage in an era in which prejudice to a former foe lingered .\nThe stories they told generally follow the arc of triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence as they gained more skills , expanded their social networks , and climbed the career ladder .\nFurthermore , the authors show how a few war brides were highly instrumental in the rapprochement and the reinvention of the New Zealand-Japan relationship , and that their new environment allowed them to exercise agency beyond the confines of the domestic realm .\nHowever , behind their \u201c success stories , \u201d the testimonies underline the internalization of Japanese gender expectations to be \u201c good wives and wise mothers \u201d ( ry\u014dsai kenbo ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most significantly , perhaps , the article points to the residual ambivalence beneath the veneer of putatively successful migrant stories told and heard across generations .\nThe third theme of the special issue pertains to commemoration and memorialization .\nWhile both these terms indicate the preservation of memory , here \u201c commemoration \u201d refers especially to intangible ceremonies and practices , and \u201c memorialization \u201d refers particularly to tangible objects such as memorial markers , monuments , and statues .\nEach indicates a form of what Maurice Halbwachs called \u201c collective memory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual , subjective psyche and contain public aspects as means of social remembering ( 1992 ) .\nThey are also forms of what Jan Assmann and John Czaplicka termed \u201c cultural memory , \u201d wherein memory becomes crystallized around objects , texts , and rituals as a prerequisite of its intergenerational transmission ( 1995 ) .\nAdditionally , they can serve as what Pierre Nora referred to as \u201c sites of memory \u201d ( lieux de m\u00e9moire ) , specially designated spaces and places of remembrance that serve as loci and focal points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nCommemoration and memorialization are closely related to mourning .\nYet , unlike private gravestones or expressions of grief , commemoration and memorialization are especially and explicitly public expressions of remembrance .\nMoreover , memorials and rituals once they enter the cultural realm can facilitate the transmission of shared remembrances long after the actual events have passed and far beyond any single individual .\nFurthermore , while , for some , commemoration and memorialization may occur in tandem with expressions of grief , they are distinguished at the same time by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past .\nCommemoration and memorialization are also highly contested .\nThis is because they are commonly markers to reaffirm self-identity , celebrating and remembering either the pain or heroism of typically a single memory group , e.g.\n, the heroism of the victors , or the suffering of the victims ( Gillis 1996 ) .\nModern war monuments and ceremonies , for instance , have been especially tied to the nation-state and have therefore tended to focus on remembering only the national war and military dead rather than the transnational and civilian victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And commemoration and memorialization often reaffirm the nation as an \u201c imagined community , \u201d through shared remembrances ( Anderson 2006 ) .\nWithin this process , nation-states wield their inordinate power to exercise what Ashplant et al .\ncalled a \u201c hegemonic framing of memory , \u201d wherein selective historical remembrances themselves are used to include or to preclude equal membership rights within the national body ( 2000 , 53 ) .\nAt the same time , commemoration and memorialization can also be sites of \u201c counter-memories \u201d used by civic or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourses of the past ( Misztal 2003 , 64 ) .\nSimilarly , it has been the function of \u201c counter-monuments \u201d \u201c not to console but to provoke \u201d and \u201c instead of monumentalizing [ \u2026 ] rather encourage people to think for themselves and motivate them to constantly remember \u201d ( Young 1992 , 276 , 274 ) .\nFurthermore , as John Bodnar noted , memorials always beautify and aestheticize the dark and painful aspects of war ; yet at the same time they can never completely hide that fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facet often reflected in the names of the dead that are carved on many memorials ( 2010 , 123 ) .\nThe essays in this special issue dealing with the general topic of \u201c commemoration and memorialization \u201d deal directly with these and other prescient questions and features as they relate to public remembrances of the Asia-Pacific War .\nFirst , Daniel Milne and David Moreton investigate Ry\u014dzen Kannon , a giant statue of the Buddhist goddess of mercy built in Kyoto in 1955 by business entrepreneur Ishikawa Hirosuke to memorialize war dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lens of Ry\u014dzen Kannon , Milne and Moreton trace the shifting landscape of Japanese war memory and commemoration of the war dead , identifying points of convergence and divergence between the pre- and postwar eras , and tracing the complex relationship vis-a-vis memorialization between civic and state actors .\nIn the authors \u2019 analysis , Ishikawa and his pet project , Ry\u014dzen Kannon , are a mini-drama for a larger transformation in Japanese nationalism and patriotism in general .\nOn the one hand , Ishikawa and Ry\u014dzen Kannon carried over from the prewar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to absolve them of wrongdoing via religious purification .\nYet on the other hand , Ishikawa strove to distinguish his memorial from earlier forms of Yasukuni nationalism and to achieve a broader view that emphasized Japan \u2019 s commitment to postwar liberal internationalism .\nAs the authors show , however , sites of memory such as Ry\u014dzen Kannon are temporally bounded not only by the lifespan of their memory communities , but also broader geopolitical memory regimes , here specifically that of the Cold War .\nNext , Arnel Joven shifts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Namely , he zooms in on the shifting historical remembrances of an American-Filipino POW camp , Camp O \u2019 Donnell , run by the Japanese military on Luzon Island .\nLike other articles in this special issue , Joven \u2019 s essay highlights the dominant role of Cold War geopolitics in shaping memories and narratives at the site .\nNamely , this was the construction of a \u201c canonical narrative \u201d which focused on the shared suffering of Filipino and American prisoners at the camp , a facet that resonated nicely with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a joint and \u201c equal \u201d partnership .\nYet as the Cold War geopolitical dynamics shifted and the regime of Ferdinand Marcos lost its popular legitimacy , local activists called for greater recognition of the suffering of Filipinos , who had outnumbered US POWs at the camp .\nBut the influence of the geopolitical maneuverings of trans-Pacific empires had not yet dissipated .\nThis was evidenced in 1991 , when the pro-US Philippine President Corazon Aquino opened the Capas National Shrine to commemorate the Allied soldiers who died at Camp O \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too indicated the ongoing instrumentalization of historical memories and narratives for contemporary political purposes , since the construction of the shrine was partly used to silence widespread popular anti-America and anti-US-base sentiment .\nMeanwhile , Mo Tian shows how the instrumentalization of Asia-Pacific War memories has been a trans-Pacific affair , and subject to neo-imperialist desires on both sides of the Asia-Pacific .\nTian focuses on the ways in which Cold War and contemporary geopolitical alliances have influenced changes to official war remembrances and narratives in the People \u2019 s Republic of China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that the PRC has characterized the war , initially portraying it as a Communist-led \u201c war of resistance \u201d and victory of the proletariat class over imperialism , only later to abandon this in favor of an emphasis on shared national humiliation and suffering at the hands of the Japanese .\nAlong with this , Japanese war crimes , which had initially been largely downplayed in Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) remembrances , eventually came to receive much more attention and to gain prominence amidst growing regional nationalism .\nAnd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the role of the Kuomintang nationalists went from negative toward positive , reflecting the CCP \u2019 s desire to win support for Taiwanese reintegration with the Chinese mainland .\nThe last article in the special issue , by Mahon Murphy , points to future paths for research about commemorating the Asia-Pacific War through comparison with the twentieth century \u2019 s other \u201c World War.\n\u201d While most of our contributors reflect on the future of Asia-Pacific War memory , Murphy provides a vital intervention by urging us to look back in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have overlooked .\nMurphy \u2019 s article explores some common themes between commemoration of the First and Second World Wars , and the potential for linking historiographical developments in studies of both conflicts .\nThe shift in the geographical lens of studies of the First World War away from the Western Front in France ushered in new ways of thinking about war , empire , and its impact on the so-called peripheries of the globe .\nLooking at modern commemoration practices from a comparative perspective of both world wars helps to not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also to re-integrate the peripheries into a truly global narrative .\nWe began our introduction to this special issue under the heading of \u201c re-examination \u201d and highlighted three ways in which contributing essays go about this .\nWe , therefore , would like to close by making a final appeal for the process of re-examination itself .\nPerhaps the main reason for re-examination is that once is never enough : memory is always changing and never static .\nWe are constantly updating and revising our memories to meet contemporary needs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowenthal 1985 , 348 ; Munslow 2006 , ix ) .\nMoreover , as Viet Thanh Nguyen astutely noted in the title of his 2016 book on memories of the Vietnam War , with memory \u201c nothing ever dies.\n\u201d That is to say , battles for the ownership of the past continue on long after the original conflicts have ended .\nAnd this phenomenon is not limited just to recent events either ; remembrances even of ancient events often continue to inform contemporaneous notions of identity and global geopolitics today .\nMuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context , and what we remember and forget is constantly changing as generations pass and political regimes rise and fall .\nYet still nothing is ever really \u201c finished \u201d nor even forgotten in this sense .\nAs St. Augustine observed one and a half millennia ago , memory is a \u201c vast , immeasurable sanctuary \u201d whose depths can never be fully plumbed ( 1961 , 216 ) .\nIt is the very present-day utility of memory in combination with its sheer limitlessness that makes it so : insofar as they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations and groups will always find something to remember .\nStill , the passage of time makes a difference for how we remember .\nIn particular , time has the tendency to smooth over memory \u2019 s rough edges , and its most contested and problematic elements , into a generally simplified and easily condensed narrative .\nAs memory scholars , thus , we must be particularly attentive to the granular details and to what precisely is lost along the long route of remembrance .\nAdded to this , today , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which remembrance occurs .\nFor instance , Pierre Nora mused on the effects of modernity and technology on memory which he thought had led to an abundance of preservation and proliferation of memories ( 1989 ) .\nSupercomputers , to take one contemporary example , enable us to preserve and record vast amounts of information .\nBut we can also observe the opposite effects and trends .\nGlobalization and technology have not just led to an abundance of memory but also a memory deficit .\nJust as capital and power are centralizing around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergone a process of centralization , concentration , and simplification .\nTwitter feeds for example amplify some messages to astounding proportions but the actual number of messages in fact decreases .\nWe can see the same trend with Asia-Pacific War memories and narratives , which center around a few hot button issues that fan the Twitter flames .\nThe effects of this mnemonic centralization are the marginalization and even erasure of alternative memories and narratives , especially ones which occupy complicated gray zones or are not easily reduced to simple messages such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us vs. them.\n\u201d Memory work , therefore , is a never-ending , infinite process that necessitates continued critical examination as contemporary technology , society , ideology , and geopolitics shift and transform .\nThis is the salient point that we wish to highlight through this introduction and the broader special issue , as contributing essays open new avenues for exploration and highlight the ever-shifting contours of Asia-Pacific War memories .\nThe editors would like to thank , first and foremost , all the special issue contributors for their continued patience with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extend our deep gratitude to Nichibunken for letting us use its space and facilities to expand our conference to a global reach .\nAdditionally , we greatly appreciate

done previously at several ballots .\nHis rival and obvious successor to take over the Liberal Party , Josh Frydenberg , did not .\nDutton , Australia \u2019 s new opposition leader , is a reactionary , though he must couch his ascent to the leadership in more accommodating terms .\nHe is a reminder of a brand of politics that Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the norm : callous , self-centred , free of vision and hostile to outsiders .\nUnder Howard , illegal wars were launched , a national security state created , and torturous offshore detention centres established in Pacific outposts .\nHis time in office was characterised by an oleaginous , ignorant smugness .\nIt was Dutton who seemingly wanted to stay on this mummified path .\nIn the tribal wars affecting his own party , which saw an ongoing battle between Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull , both eventually having spells as Liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s hand .\nTowards Turnbull , he was particularly vicious , cultivating hard line support for his own leadership credentials .\nIt was Dutton who finally saw off the meeker and more moderate Turnbull in August 2018 , signalling his own leadership challenge with the subtlety of a hangman and the graciousness of a prison escapee .\nBut his time to be leader had not come .\nWithin the Liberal Party , Dutton was seen as electoral bile in various seats in Victoria and New South Wales , an extreme and extremist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineered the assassination in favour of conservative values , but the profits of leadership would go to Scott Morrison and his deputy Josh Frydenberg .\nIn his autobiography , A Bigger Picture , Turnbull explained why , in the palace coup , he preferred Morrison as his replacement .\n\u201c Dutton , were he to become prime minister , would run off

\u201c assumed people have a reasonable amount of self-awareness \u201d .\nGiven such awareness , Dutton never struck the defeated Turnbull \u201c as being so self-delusional and narcissistic as to imagine that he could successfully lead the Liberal Party .\nMore relevantly , it had never occurred to me that others would think he could either.\n\u201d Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrifying about the national security state and corrosive to democratic accountability .\nHe ruled over Australia \u2019 s new super Department of Home Affairs and showed every sign of loving it .\nMore national security

of intellect lurking like newly discovered permafrost .\nWest Australian premier Mark McGowan , and former Australian prime ministers Kevin Rudd and Paul Keating , see things rather differently .\nFor McGowan , Dutton is an \u201c extremist \u201d , incapable of listening , \u201c extremely conservative \u201d and not \u201c that smart \u201d .\nRudd sees an \u201c idiot \u201d who believes that

Pakistan has sought relief from foreign debt obligations and an IMF bailout deal .\nInitial arrangements for a three year deal with the IMF began in 2019 , but Pakistan says that deal , originally for $ 6 billion USD , is \u2018 outdated \u2019 due to the covid pandemic and new global financial pressures .\nThe nation now says it is in \u2018 dire need \u2019 of at least $ 36 billion in order to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back over $ 21 billion USD in foreign debt within the next fiscal year .\nIt is also struggling with extensive food inflation and supply chain disruptions as the government seeks to import at least 3 million tons of wheat and 4 million tons of cooking oil to alleviate shortages .\nThis is yet another example of the spread of global inflation/stagflation that is going largely ignored by western media outlets .\nNations like Pakistan with already weakened economic conditions are canaries in the coal mine ; leading indicators of what is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations should current conditions continue .\nWith globalist institutions like the UN , the IMF , the BIS , World Bank and the WEF all predicting major food shortages this year , the mainstream media has been noticeably quiet when it comes to nations where the crisis is already bubbling to the surface .\nThe reason the instability in Pakistan is particularly concerning is because it is one of nine countries in the world ( officially ) with a nuclear arsenal , not to mention an ongoing border conflict with India which sparked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as a limited war in 1999 .\nAs economic instability rises so does public discontent and rebellion .\nBy extension , political elites commonly offer war as a \u201c release valve \u201d for public anger and a distraction from financial pain .\nOtherwise , the potential for widespread civil unrest grows daily .\nTo be sure , Pakistan is not the only country facing these conditions today , it is one of many .\nHowever , unlike many African or South American nations where the effects of inflationary collapse remain mitigated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan could have international implications .\nBeyond the threats associated with sinking economies and regional conflicts , the IMF has become the go-to loan shark , circling struggling nations when it smells blood in the water .\nAs more and more countries face declines associated with inflation/stagflation , it is not conspiratorial to suggest that the IMF greatly benefits .\nAs the world breaks down , more nations become beholden to the IMF debt structure until eventually they are

process .\n\u201c People smugglers have obviously decided who is going to win the election and the boats have already started.\n\u201d The Minister for Home Affairs , Karen Andrews , was also mining

two burning questions .\nThe first goes to the troubling relationship with Sri Lanka , which the Australian government had gone some ways to promoting as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tended to skirt over issues of human rights , not least those associated with that country \u2019 s long civil war .\nIn fact , Australian officials have done their best to encourage Colombo to prevent individuals leaving Sri Lanka with a view of heading to Australia by boat .\nIn 2013 , 2014 and 2017 , Bay-class naval vessels were gifted to the Sri Lankan Navy to aid the interception of smuggling operations .\nDuring his time

smuggling and to further strengthen ties between our two countries.\n\u201d He duly rubbished people smugglers \u2013 they had been \u201c cowardly and malicious \u201d for aiding individuals to pursue their right to asylum \u2013 and praised the success of Operation Sovereign Borders .\n\u201c Since we started turning back boats there have been no known deaths at sea.\n\u201d In June 2019 , he paid another visit to shore up the commitment .\nIt was prompted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sri Lankan asylum seekers had been intercepted off Australia \u2019 s north-west coast , with the possibility of six others on route .\nThen , as now , Dutton could only blame his Labor opponents for somehow encouraging such journeys while reiterating the standard , draconian line .\n\u201c People are not coming here [ to Australia ] by boat and regardless of what people smugglers tell you , the Morrison government , under the Prime Minister and myself , will not allow those people to arrive by boat.\n\u201d The second question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sovereign Borders .\nThis military grade , secretive policy had supposedly \u201c stopped the boats \u201d and remains a favourite Coalition mantra .\nBut why reveal a chink in the armour , a breach in the fortress unless it was manufactured with the aid of the Sri Lankan authorities or a failure to being with ?\nAs comedian and political commentator Dan Ilic observed in a pointed remark to Dutton : \u201c This happened on your watch dude.\n\u201d The Sri Lankan revelation demonstrated , when it comes to such matters , mendacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No side in Australian politics has been able to avoid politicising the issue of refugee and asylum arrivals via boat .\nThe moment Australia \u2019 s Labor government made the arrival of individuals without formal authorisation a breach of law warranting mandatory detention , the issue became a political matter .\nIt took the Liberal National Coalition led by Prime Minister John Howard to turn the issue into a form of feral , gonzo politics .\nThat form remains unforgettably marked by the use of SAS personnel against 400 individuals , rescued at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MV Tampa , in August 2001 .\nIn defiance of maritime conventions and in blatant disregard for human safety , the Howard government held the asylum seekers at sea off Christmas Island for almost ten days .\nThose on the vessel were accused of piracy and economic opportunism .\nFrom this barbarism issued the Pacific Solution , a tropical concentration camp system which has had a few iterations since .\nGovernments , both Coalition and Labor , have drawn political capital from harsh policies against unwanted naval arrivals , smearing the merits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugee law .\nThe new Albanese government has the chance , however unlikely it is to pursue it , to extract the political and replace it with the humanitarian .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on Instagram , Twitter and Facebook

Dutton confirmed his candidacy for the leadership of the Liberal Party the public relations campaign to \u201c soften \u201d his image went into overdrive .\nThe so-called \u201c hard man \u201d says he is keen to show the public \u201c the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , friends and colleagues see \u201d .\nAs traditional Liberal voters turn away from the party , Dutton wants us to know what he believes in .\n\u201c We aren \u2019 t the Moderate party .\nWe aren \u2019 t the Conservative party .\nWe are Liberals .\nWe are the Liberal party .\nWe believe in families \u2013 whatever their composition \u201d , he said .\nDutton \u2019 s leadership of the Liberal Party is a concern given his demonstrated commitment to eroding democratic principles including : the separation of powers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal freedom and free speech ; government transparency and accountability ; as well as suppressing dissent and prosecuting state crime and corruption .\nIt would require a thesis to adequately detail the dozens of pieces of rights-eroding laws and hundreds of amendments to existing laws championed by Dutton in his various portfolios as minister for immigration , home affairs and defence .\nBelow is a thumbnail sketch of the slippery slope into authoritarianism , in which Dutton has played an instrumental part .\nSupporters of civil liberties , such as Edward Snowden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is no freedom \u201d when discussing the proliferation of state surveillance in modern societies .\nThe ability to freely communicate without arbitrary monitoring and a fear of prosecution is essential to a healthy democracy .\nHowever , supporters of privacy-eroding laws , under the guise of protection against perceived and , often exaggerated , threats will often use phrases such as \u201c you have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide \u201d .\nThe \u201c need \u201d to protect us against terrorists has been used to justify many laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the most pervasive surveillance laws of any Western democracy .\nWhen Snowden exposed the United States National Security Agency \u2019 s illegal surveillance of its own citizens , the Coalition government passed many draconian laws giving the state and its agents more powers .\nDutton played an integral role in their formulation , advocacy and passage into law .\nWithout a national bill or charter of rights there has been little to stand in the way of these laws being enacted .\n1 .\nCompelling internet service providers to store user data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The meta-data retention laws , passed in 2015 , were marketed as necessary to protect against the threat of terrorism .\nThey require internet and phone service providers ( ISPs ) to store your personal data for two years and make it available to a range of law enforcement agencies without those agencies having to obtain a warrant .\nSimilar laws were proposed , but rejected , in Britain due to their arbitrary and pervasive nature .\nThey have not been enacted in any other Western country .\nYou don \u2019 t have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities to access and monitor at least two years of a range of your personal data .\nMeta-data includes : telephone records ; the time and length of phone calls ; the internet protocol addresses ( IP addresses ) of computers from which messages are received or sent ; location of parties making phone calls ; to and from email addresses on emails ; logs of visitors to chat rooms online ; status of chat sites \u2014 whether they are active and how many people are participating ; chat aliases or identifiers ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chat room online ) ; start and finish times of internet sessions ; the location of an individual involved in communications , and the name of the application someone uses online and when , where and for how long used .\nMeta data does not encompass the actual content of communications and ISPs have made it clear that filtering content , such as text in SMS transmissions , and emails for such a large number of users would be a mammoth and potentially impossible task .\nThe concern is that all of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided to authorities and there is currently no information regarding whether or not this is happening .\nThere is no evidence to date that the laws have proven to be an effective mechanism against terrorists .\nThere is , however , evidence that the laws are being used by a range of agencies not involved in the detection or prosecution of terrorism ; agencies that can apply under the laws to access the personal data .\nIt was revealed that in 2018 more than 60 government agencies applied to the Attorney-General for metadata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taxation Office , Department of Human Services and even local councils .\nBankstown Council applied for metadata access in an attempt to catch illegal rubbish dumpers and those who breach by-laws .\nThat access was granted .\nThe Queensland Police Service used the scheme to access the metadata of cadets in an attempt to determine whether they were sleeping with one another , or faking sick days .\nThe Australian Federal Police ( AFP ) has used meta-data laws to access information given to journalists and even doctors to identify their sources \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government agencies .\nIndeed , the AFP admitted in 2019 to accessing the meta-data of 20,000 people over the previous 12 months \u2014 without having to inform its targets , let alone justify its conduct .\nIn another unprecedented move , Dutton championed laws enacted in 2017 which compel technology companies , such as Facebook , Google and Apple , to surrender their encryption keys to the accounts of Australian individuals and organisations upon service of a warrant and to even alter , or delete , the information .\nThe laws were passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since been used to access the accounts of not only individuals , but news organisations .\nThe laws were condemned here as well as overseas , with ABC News executive editor John Lyons tweeting during the 2019 raids of its Sydney office : \u201c I \u2019 m still staggered by the power of this warrant .\nIt allows the AFP to \u2018 copy , delete or alter \u2019 material in the ABC \u2019 s computers .\nAll Australians , please think about that : as of this moment , the AFP has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s computers .\nAustralia 2019.\n\u201d A group of United Nations special rapporteurs expressed concern the law would \u201c disproportionately chill the work of media outlets and journalists by exposing human rights campaigners , activists and academics to criminal charges and , in doing do , contravene the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \u201d .\n3 .\nIncreased search , seizure , detention and compelled disclosure powers at the border Dutton played a pivotal role in the enactment of the Australian Border Force Act in 2015 , which gave officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) frighteningly broad and indeterminate powers \u201c to do all things necessary or convenient to be done for or in connection with the performance of his or her duties \u201d .\nThis includes broadened powers to search and detain travellers and to seize their personal items .\nDutton oversaw amendments in 2018 which made it a crime , punishable by up to five years in prison , for such persons to decline to provide passwords to their smartphones , computers or other electronic devices \u2013 enabling access to all the private information .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ when dual British and Australian citizen , 46-year software developer Nathan Hague , was detained for 90 minutes and had his devices seized at Sydney Airport , without being given a reason .\nThe devices were returned weeks later without further action being taken against him .\nAuthorities refused to provide information about whether the digital data was copied and stored as the legislation permits .\nAn incensed Hague told the media at the time : \u201c I have nothing to hide , but I value my privacy \u201d .\nHome Affairs Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws to empower the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation ( ASIO ) to access the data of Australians stored overseas while , at the same time , allowing other members of the Five Eyes Alliance to have access to that data .\nThe laws established a regime of international production orders , which allow agents to directly require foreign designated communication providers to hand over stored communications and data , and even enable direct wiretapping .\nAccording to Civil Liberties Australia CEO Bill Rowlings : \u201c We \u2019 ve had nearly 20 years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top \u2013 and most absolutely slashing personal privacy \u2026 Dutton and the henchmen have all the laws they need already .\nThis is overkill \u2026 Without a federal charter of rights , there has been nothing protecting the basic rights of individual Australians.\n\u201d That \u2019 s the overriding problem : Australia is the only Western democracy without a national bill or charter of rights that could obstruct such intrusive invasions of privacy .\n5 .\nIdentify and disrupt \u2013 power to hack accounts and delete , add or alter data Described as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy \u201d , so-called \u201c identify and disrupt \u201d laws enacted last December 3 are perhaps Dutton \u2019 s pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance in terms of surveillance legislation .\nThe laws give the AFP and Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission the power to collect intelligence online , including over the dark web , disrupt online activity by manipulating data and even to take over a person \u2019 s online account \u2013 locking them out of it \u2013to \u201c gather evidence \u201d .\nAgain , this is unprecedented in the West .\nAuthorities can now legally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever they please with the data contained therein \u2014 including delete , add or alter content .\nRowlings said : \u201c The new laws allow faceless federal agents to \u2018 target and destroy \u2019 people , under what is officially called the Identify and Disrupt Bill .\nThis awful law multiplies tenfold the powers and reach of government intrusion .\nPolice have such an appalling record throughout Australia of planting evidence and wrongly locking up people for years and decades .\nWhy wouldn \u2019 t they plant more \u2018 evidence \u2019 to suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that officially ?\n\u201d These are just five of many surveillance laws overseen by the Liberal Party \u2019 s new leader .\nThe rapid degeneration into such a pervasive regime of surveillance \u2014 often under the threat of criminal sanctions \u2014 would have been the envy of past dictators .\nIt could not have been foreseen by authors such as George Orwell .\nIndeed , the \u201c Thought Police \u201d in Orwell \u2019 s iconic novel 1984 , published in 1949 , would have relished the ability to arbitrarily monitor and intercept information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integral to our daily lives as mobile phones and computers have become .\nAs Rowlings said : \u201c The police and spooks of Australia now have more powers and can reach further inside people \u2019 s lives and minds than the notorious Stasi of East Germany ever could.\n\u201d Note to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on

cricketer-turned politician , former Prime Minister of Pakistan is found openly alleging the US administration for the fall of his elected government .\nIn his interview to numerous national and international TV channels , he claims that his visit to Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of February , 2022 was not fully digested by the US administration .\nOn the other hand , he was found getting closer to China , an arch enemy of the USA .\nLiu Zongyi , secretary-general of the Research Center for China-South Asia Cooperation at the SIIS , also believes the West , and particularly the US , doesn \u2019 t want to see Khan remain in power since he has gotten tougher on them .\nImran Khan debunks allegations of corruption by the ruling coalition partners against him and his party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government was receiving a good amount of foreign remittances , collected taxes and necessary reforms were instituted to uplift the poor people from poverty .\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , Pakistan ` s economy under the leadership of Imran Khan was moving in the right direction .\nImran Khan also told the media that under his Government export reached a historic high of 25.3 billion .\nImran Khan also claims that he tried hard to repair bilateral relations with India minus the Kashmir issue .\nDespite all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toppled his elected Government and handed over the reins of the Government to the current Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif .\nImran Khan ` s ouster through no-confidence motion is , no doubt , a black spot on the political career of Imran Khan .\nSince the fall of the Government , Imran Khan is clamoring for early National Assembly elections which are valid till next August ( 2023 ) .\nCan Imran Khan win National Assembly elections with a thumping majority ?\nWill the US administration allow the current Government under dynastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are circulating in Pakistan as well as in other parts of the world .\nAt the domestic level , Imran Khan along with his party ( Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ) workers , sympathizers and supporters is seen mobilizing the masses against corrupt political dynasties through rallies and public speeches .\nPeople are coming to his rallies en masse and listening to him attentively assuring him that they will vote for him and his party .\nThe current government is advancing its vicious agenda against Imran Khan ` s domestic and international policies which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe current Government with the help of pro-government media houses are found flashing these points and trying hard to build anti- Imran Khan Propaganda .\nIt is also a fact that Pakistan \u2019 s economy is suffocating and inflation is running high at 10 % .\nAt the international level , Khan is seen coaxing Russia , China , Saudi Arabia , Turkey and other like-minded Middle East countries to support him in winning back Pakistan .\nAs of today , Russia is busy winning Ukraine .\nThe Russia- Ukraine war is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine President by supplying modern weaponry and financial assistance so in such a situation , Russia ` s priorities would be different than helping Imran Khan to occupy the seat of power in Pakistan .\nChina \u2013 Pakistan are tied up with the progress of USD 60 billion China- Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) .\nNewly appointed foreign minister of Pakistan \u2013 Bilawal Bhutto Zardari made a maiden visit to China in May 2022 and discussed economic coordination , industrialization and speeding up of the USD 60 billion CPEC .\nNevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are against the CPEC .\nThe reality is that the CPEC would remain a stumbling block between the new government under Shehbaz Sharif and the US administration under US President Joe Biden .\nSo in such a situation when the US administration is against the CPEC , China would not be that helpful to Imran Khan in winning back the seat of power .\nThe countries in the Middle East including Saudi Arabia might transfer their loyalty to the Sharif family as the former Prime Minister of Pakistan and his brother Nawaz Sharif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other Middle East countries .\nSo in such a situation Imran Khan might not get full political , financial support as it is expected .\nAbove that , the US administration is so powerful as to put political pressure on the monarchies of the Middle East and would try

ideologically diverse .\nImran Khan believes that this partnership is weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt is his illusion .\nThis is not going to happen .\nMoney , power binds the enemies together .\nImran Khan would not be able to bring back defectors to his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party as they are given assurances by the current government of plum posts .\nAnother weak point with Imran Khan is that his relations with the powerful army of Pakistan have worsened and there is no chance that Imran Khan would ever become the darling of the Pakistan Army .\nThe friendship between the US administration and Imran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Biden thinks that he is no longer useful to the national interests of the USA .\nThe CIA of the USA might pump funds to undermine the credibility of Imran Khan among the voters of Pakistan and influence the election .\nTherefore , Imran Khan and his party would not be able to win national assembly elections and form the next government .\nPossibly , Imran Khan might face

, rising living standards , population growth and massive electrification will increase Indonesia \u2019 s electricity demand 30-fold , to 9,000 Terawatt-hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid increase in electricity consumption raises concerns about energy security and affordability , and environmental sustainability .\nOur previous study shows the country could meet its energy needs by relying on its abundant solar energy .\nBy installing billions of solar panels Indonesia could harvest about 190,000 TWh of solar energy per year .\nThis amount of energy is larger than world \u2019 s electricity consumption in 2020 .\nHowever , relying on solar energy means Indonesia must be able to deal with the risk of shortage because the sun doesn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solar-dominated electricity system overnight and during rainy periods , Indonesia will need large amounts of energy storage .\nFortunately , Indonesia has a nature-based solution to this problem : the country can use its enormous potential for off-river pumped hydro energy storage ( PHES ) .\nPHES is a technique to store energy by using excess power produced from solar panels during sunny days to pump water uphill to a higher reservoir .\nWhen power generation is low during cloudy weather or at night , electricity can then be dispatched on demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downhill to the lower reservoir through the turbine .\nIn our latest study , we have identified that excellent sites for PHES reservoirs are available all over the country , including the heavily populated islands of Java , Bali and Sumatra .\nTo develop an off-river PHES , we need two closely spaced lakes or reservoirs of about one square kilometres each that have an altitude difference of about 600 metres .\nThey are connected by a tunnel containing a pump-turbine .\nUnlike conventional ( river-based ) PHES , we don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water flows through tunnels connecting two reservoirs .\nWe can also use old mining sites , as well as existing lakes and reservoirs .\nThis means off-river PHES systems can have low environmental and social impacts .\nThe area of land required for an off-river PHES is also relatively small .\nA typical 150 gigawatt-hour ( GWh ) off-river pumped hydro requires about 8 hectares of land per GWh .\nIn comparison , the river-based Upper Cisokan PHES project in West Java with 7 GWh of storage requires a flooded area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a lifespan of 50-100 years , off-river PHES systems also could reduce our dependency on conventional batteries , which typically have a storage lifetime of 10-15 years .\nBatteries also contain materials that are in short supply such as lithium and cobalt .\nHow large is the potential ?\nIndonesia has 26,000 potential pumped hydro sites , which is far more than needed .\nWe narrowed it down by choosing the best possible resources all over the country with the highest storage quality and the lowest cost with potential of 321 TWh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maluku Papua , and Kalimantan ) have the most potential , with low storage requirements .\nThis contrasts with the western Indonesia region ( Java and Sumatra ) , which is expected to have substantial future storage demands .\nThe following figure illustrates the size of best PHES potential in each Indonesian region compared with the requirements in 2060 for an affluent , decarbonised Indonesia .\nRegional off-river PHES potential in Indonesia .\nGreen and red circles represent PHES potential and required storage respectively .\nIn our future work , we will examine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission links from east to west for a low-cost power grid or whether the system is better operated independently in each region .\nPumped hydro storage is by far the cheapest way of storing solar energy overnight , and has by far the largest share of the global energy storage market .\nIn our recent paper , we modelled a hypothetical 150 GWh site in Wonosobo Regency in Central Java with power capacity of 7.5 gigawatts \u2013 which is a large storage system .\nThis system could run at full generating power for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height difference between the reservoirs of 741 metres , a tunnel length of 4km and requires 4ha of flooded land per GWh .\nWe estimated a capital cost of US $ 9.4 billion to develop this site , including the cost of the initial water filling and land acquisition .\nFor comparison , a Tesla utility-scale battery pack will require a capital cost of US $ 60 billion for the same capacity ( 150 GWh ) \u2013 US $ 1.2 million per 3 MWh .\nBy knowing Indonesia \u2019 s off-river PHES potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very large-scale solar generation with confidence .\nThus , an energy transition towards carbon neutrality is a realistic target to achieve .\nNote to readers

the People \u2019 s Republic of China ( PRC ) .\nIn recent years , dominant representations of the war create a memory discourse which portrays the heroic triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) over Japan .\nThis article shows how the war has been remembered from the victory of the Communist revolution in 1949 to the present in the PRC .\nIt contributes to the debate on the effectiveness and limitations of the monopoly of war memory by the CCP .\nOn 27 February 2014 , China \u2019 s national legislature , the Standing Committee of the National Congress reached a landmark decision in the history of Chinese memory politics .\nIt designated 13 December as the National Memorial Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 , memorial ceremonies have been held annually on 13 December in the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall , in which top members of the CCP leadership participate .\nOn the same day , themes of war appear in national and regional newspapers , urging readers to carry on war memory by never forgetting the pain and suffering that Chinese went through in the war years .\nThroughout the same month , audiences can find similar themes in documentaries , television dramas , and films .\nThe commemoration of the war through national ceremonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRC is committed to shaping a sense of victimhood in Chinese identity .\nAt the same time , it also shows that the memory of the war is deeply embedded in the social discourse of the PRC .\nThis article analyzes the development of official discourse of the memory of the Second Sino-Japanese War from 1949 to the present in the PRC .\nThe official memory discourse is defined as ways in which certain images , people and events associated with the war are remembered by performing official rituals or through official representations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most countries , the construction of official state discourse of war memory is a practice of political engineering , in which narratives are selected , institutionalized , legitimized , and delegitimized by state agents and individuals .\nIn this process , state agents aim at establishing and maintaining the monopoly over the narratives of war , but also actively prevent the development of counter narratives .\nIndividuals construct alternative ways of remembering the war that tend to question the accepted narratives , but they have not been successful in establishing counter memories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narratives .\nThe official state discourse ends up as closely controlled narratives that consist of heroic resistance and nationalist victimization .\nAlternative memory of the war largely falls into the scope of the controlled narratives .\nBy surveying the evolution and structure of state war memory , this article contributes to our understanding of the dominant role of the state in shaping the official discourse of war memory in the PRC .\nThe article is structured into four main sections : state control , narrative , themes of war memory , and private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe article first introduces memory theory and presents a survey of existing scholarship as the basis of analysis , and it presents the ways in which the Chinese state extends its control over public commemoration and memorialization of the war .\nThen , the article outlines the structure of war memory , analyzing three types of narratives : the narrative of resistance , the victor narrative , and the victim narrative .\nThe article continues to illustrate how the Communists , the Nationalists and Japan have been remembered in the public and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the article turns its attention to the memoirs and oral histories of Chinese veterans , and it discusses how these mechanisms function as a variation of the official memory of the war .\nMemory studies has recently become a burgeoning field in the West and scholarly attention to the memory of the Second Sino-Japanese War is gathering momentum .\nIn the field of memory , the French sociologist Maurice Halbwachs in the 1920s developed the concept of \u201c collective memory \u201d which he defined as a shared perception of the past formed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social and cultural groups ( Halbwachs 1992 ) .\nThe German Egyptologist Jan Assmann and the cultural studies scholar Aleida Assmann have introduced the term \u201c cultural memory \u201d into the debate .\nAccording to the Assmanns , cultural memory is determined by social conditions , political institutions , and power structures ( Aleida Assmann 2011 ; Jan Assmann 2011 ) .\nIn this context , the study of the memory of the Second Sino-Japanese War in the PRC has attracted some academic attention .\nChan Yang assesses how the war memory evolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular attention to the roles of state and non-state actors in developing the discourse of war memory in the period between 1949 and 1982 ( 2018 ) .\nRana Mitter and Zheng Wang , among others , have explored the links among war memory , nationalism , and politics in the PRC ( Mitter 2020 ; Wang 2012 ) .\nOther studies focus on specific aspects of war memory in the PRC .\nAaron William Moore \u2019 s study , though not exclusively focused on the PRC \u2019 s war memory , examines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese servicemen in the war from 1937 to 1945 ( Moore 2013 ) .\nKirk Denton analyzes the narratives of war and their political and ideological implications in the PRC \u2019 s state museums ( Denton 2014 ) .\nWhile these studies illustrate the extensive literature on the Chinese memory of the war , there remains , so far , no study that specifically examines the structure of the official state discourse of war memory in the PRC from 1949 to the present .\nThis article utilizes the theories of memory reconstruction by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory in the PRC .\nIt shows how central themes of the PRC \u2019 s war memory are sustained by the media and institutions , among which are artifacts like textbooks , memorial museums , and oral histories .\nThis article contributes to the discussion of the PRC \u2019 s official state discourse of memory relating to the Second Sino-Japanese War .\nSince the Communist takeover of China in 1949 , the discourses of war memory have been constantly subject to a high level of political manipulation , and war memory has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CCP to consolidate its legitimacy .\nThis article also contributes to illustrating the periodization of war memory in the PRC .\nIt suggests that the Chinese official discourse of war memory is divided into the Mao era ( 1949-1976 ) and the post-Mao era ( 1976 to present ) .\nIn the Mao era , the CCP established a discourse of war memory that emphasized the victory of the Communist revolution and the anti-Japanese resistance led by the Communists .\nIn the post-Mao era , the newly-emerging victim narrative that emphasized Japanese atrocities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mao era in the discourse of war memory .\nThe victim narrative tended to overshadow the victor narrative for thirty years from the 1980s to the 2000s .\nSince Xi Jinping took power in 2012 , the victor narrative has made a strong comeback in the official discourse of war memory in the PRC .\nThe Second Sino-Japanese War is a major catastrophe and national struggle in Chinese history .\nThe tragic and heroic nature of the war explains why it has been important for the PRC to commemorate and memorialize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the war is one of the most destructive episodes in modern Chinese history .\nIt is estimated that during the war , approximately 100 million people were forced to become refugees and at least 20 million civilians were killed ( Larry and MacKinnon 2001 , 6 ) .\nThe human rights abuses during the war were so catastrophic that even after seventy years the scars have not yet been healed in contemporary Chinese society .\nOn the other hand , the war was the most heroic moment in Chinese history .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese people to liberate themselves from the exploitation of foreign imperialist powers .\nThe CCP claims to have played a leading role in the war .\nTherefore , how the war is publicly remembered becomes relevant to the construction of Chinese nationalism and to the consolidation of the CCP \u2019 s legitimacy .\nThe PRC government uses a nationalist rhetoric to define the nature of the war .\nThe official discourse refers to the war as the \u201c Chinese People \u2019 s Anti-Japanese War of Resistance , \u201d rather than using a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War .\nAs indicated by the term \u201c resistance , \u201d China \u2019 s involvement in the war is framed in a nationalist fashion , emphasizing the defense and sacrifice of Chinese people for national liberation .\nThe term \u201c resistance \u201d also serves to downplay Chinese collaboration with Japan , which widely existed as part of everyday life in many areas of wartime China.1 The PRC government has been seeking ways to create official memories of the war that serves to stabilize Communist rule .\nIn this process , political considerations predominate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe processes of constructing war memory in the PRC impose exclusiveness .\nThe official memory of the war should never be challenged , amended , or overturned .\nWhile the opportunities to generate memories of the war abound , the government spares no effort to suppress memories that deviate from the official memories , because this raises questions that are difficult for the government to answer .\nTo be sure , the state is unable to completely deter alternative memories that exist in the private sphere .\nAlternative memories will inevitably coexist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alternative memories are closely monitored by the government , and it is unlikely that they will prevail in the public domain and become an established way of remembering .\nThe state monopoly on the official discourse of war memory prescribes rules for what is to be remembered and what is to be forgotten .\nThe commemoration and remembering of the war are repeatedly articulated through mass media , which facilitate public identification of China as the victor/victim and of Japan as the perpetrator .\nStories of Japanese wartime atrocities such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in television dramas , films , and documentaries , reminding the Chinese public to never forget national grievances , deprivation , and humiliation at the hands of Japanese aggressors , as well as the hard-earned national liberation .\nMeanwhile , the state \u2019 s significant attention to remembering this war overshadows the collective remembering of other wars that China fought in the twentieth century , from the Sino-Soviet War ( 1929 ) and the Civil War ( 1945-1949 ) in the Republican era to the Korean War ( 1950-1953 ) and the Sino-Vietnamese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era .\nThe Sino-Soviet War and Sino-Vietnamese War , especially , have been almost forgotten in the social discourse of the PRC .\nWhile these military conflicts are certainly significant events that have received public attention , their legacies have not been remembered in the same way as the Second Sino-Japanese War .\nThe PRC facilitates memories of the war that clearly distinguishes between \u201c self \u201d and \u201c other.\n\u201d The Communists are always the \u201c self.\n\u201d The \u201c other \u201d could be the Nationalists as an internal foe or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the postwar period , both the Nationalists and the Japanese have been blamed for causing sufferings to the Chinese during the war .\nIn the Mao era , the Nationalists were stigmatized as counterrevolutionaries who had oppressed the Chinese people .\nIt is only since the 1980s that the PRC has begun to rehabilitate the Nationalist \u201c other \u201d and publicly acknowledge their contribution in the war .\nThe reason for this change was that after the death of Mao , the PRC policy towards Taiwan shifted from confrontation to engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nationalists in Taiwan to negotiate a reunification treaty .\nHowever , this gesture of rehabilitation avoided acknowledging the Nationalists \u2019 critical role in the war .\nThe Nationalists were still regarded as an internal \u201c other , \u201d rather than part of the \u201c self.\n\u201d For their part , the Japanese have been demonized as \u201c devils \u201d who committed appalling crimes against the Chinese .\nThis model of dichotomy between self and other in the PRC \u2019 s war memory demonstrates the state manipulation of war memory , which honors the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemns the Japanese .\nWhile the war occupies a significant position in the PRC \u2019 s national memory today , memories of the war have evolved from partial oblivion to full revival .\nIn the first thirty years of Communist rule , the war was publicly remembered as a revolutionary victory of proletarian over imperialist exploitation .\nThe \u201c liberation \u201d narrative dominated the official discourse of war memory , highlighting heroism and avoiding expressions of suffering .\nRepresentations of the war were limited to heroic triumph in the public sphere .\nAfter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned Mao \u2019 s political line of class struggle , and loosened its control over narratives of the war memory .\nAccordingly , war memory entered the public sphere under the auspices of the state , and a discourse of suffering and humiliation evolved in this process .\nThe trends in the development of war memory in the PRC are most evident in the state initiative of building war and military museums across the country .\nIn the Mao era , the state made only limited efforts to preserve war memory , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erected to commemorate the war .\nIn the 1950s , the Chinese government established a military museum in Beijing to exhibit the victory of Chinese revolution under the leadership of the CCP .\nThe narratives of museum exhibitions portrayed the war as a heroic triumph in the course of China \u2019 s revolutionary history .\nDue to the domestic political chaos , the museum remained closed for much of the 1960s and 1970s ( Denton 2014 , 121-132 ) .\nThe Chinese government set up another museum dedicated to Japanese war crimes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserve the memory of Japanese atrocities and to implement the political \u201c re-education \u201d of Japanese prisoners of war after 1945 ( Mitter 2020 , 112 ) .\nIn the post-Mao era , public museums dedicated to the Second Sino-Japanese War mushroomed across the country .\nThe Museum of War of Resistance against Japan was erected in the Beijing suburb of Wanping where the war had broken out in 1937 , in July 1987 , which soon became the national center for remembering and commemorating the Second Sino-Japanese War .\nThe Nanjing Massacre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1985 , the 40th anniversary of the end of the war .\nThe Nanjing Museum of the Site of Lijixiang Comfort Station opened as its branch in December 2015 , housing the archival evidence of Chinese \u201c sex slaves \u201d ( aka \u201c comfort women \u201d ) who were forced to serve the Japanese military in Nanjing under the Japanese occupation .\nOther museums that the state has constructed to memorialize the war include the Museum of the Criminal Evidence of Japanese Imperial Army Unit 731 built outside of Harbin in 1985 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Shenyang in 1991 to commemorate the 1931 \u201c Mukden Incident.\n\u201d Figure 1 : The Museum of the War of Chinese People \u2019 s Resistance Against Japanese Aggression .\nPhoto by Fanghong , CC BY-SA 3.0 via Wikimedia Commons .\nAfter Xi Jinping took office in 2012 , the CCP strengthened its control of the official war memory discourse .\nThis is evident in the CCP \u2019 s initiative to redefine the nature of the war in textbooks .\nIn January 2017 , The Ministry of Education announced that the Second Sino-Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fourteen years instead of eight years , starting with Japan \u2019 s invasion of Manchuria on 18 September 1931 in what is known as the Mukden Incident ( Zhao 2017 , 12 ) .\nThe war had long been defined as an eight-year struggle lasting from 1937 to 1945 , in which the start date is the Marco Polo Bridge Incident on 7 July 1937 .\nThe 2017 government edict declared that official interpretations of the war from now on would have to use the \u201c fourteen-year \u201d definition .\nTextbooks referring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a comprehensive amendment .\nIt is remarkable that not just history textbooks but also textbooks of other subjects such as Chinese and ethics would have to update the wording wherever the war is mentioned ( Huanqiu , 2017 ) .\nThe PRC \u2019 s war memory discourse consists of narratives of resistance , victor , and victim .\nThe resistance narrative emphasizes national unity and solidarity in fighting for national liberation .\nIts focus is on the memorialization of heroes and battles .\nThe government has designated many personalities as heroes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officially designated heroes include not only civilians and Communist and Nationalist servicemen , but also foreign military officers , doctors and journalists who assisted China in fighting the Japanese .\nThe battles fought by the Communists and Nationalists in the war are another theme in the war memory .\nIn recent years , Chinese newspapers have reported numerous stories of battles during the war .\nFor example , in 2014 the People \u2019 s Daily ( Renmin Ribao ) , the mouthpiece of the CCP , reprinted documents relating to thirty battles that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war .\nThe documents were temporarily published online by the National Archives Bureau in 2014 .\nThey are selected from many written records about the war in numerous historical archives across the country .\nThese documents detail the course of the battles , the number of casualties and the intensity of resistance .\nThe resistance narrative is further consolidated by the CCP \u2019 s directive to redefine the length of the war in textbooks already touched upon .\nIt has constructed a way of remembering the war that gives prominence to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan .\nAccording to the People \u2019 s Daily , this decision aims to establish a way of remembering that the war is a long-term nationalist struggle led by the CCP .\nThe revisionism is justified on the grounds of characterizing the war as an \u201c uninterrupted \u201d historical process and a \u201c continuous \u201d struggle .\nIn this view , the \u201c total \u201d war of resistance at the national level ( 1937-1945 ) evolved from the \u201c partial \u201d war of resistance at the regional level ( 1931-1937 ) .\nDuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to mobilize national unity to resist Japanese aggression .\nThe \u201c partial \u201d war of resistance is both the basis and preparation for the subsequent national struggle .\nThese two periods are inseparable , forming an uninterrupted \u201c historical chain \u201d ( Zhang 2017,11 ) .\nIt must be pointed out , however , that Chinese resistance as such during 1931 to 1936 is a myth , and its significance should not be overestimated .\nFrom 1931 to 1936 , the resistance activity was concentrated in Manchuria where Japan established a client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1932 .\nThe overall resistance during this period was relatively weak and sporadic .\nThe highest estimate for membership in the resistance is around 300,000 , accounting for approximately one percent of the 30 million population of Manchuria in the early 1930s ( Mitter 2000 , 200 ) .\nWhen Manchukuo was established , the Japanese Kwantung Army launched a series of large military operations to eliminate resistance activity , and as a result , by 1933 the resistance had been largely suppressed .\nThe anti-Japanese resistance can not be simply understood through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the complex structure of resistance membership .\nThe resistance members included Chinese and Korean Communists , soldiers of the reorganized army of the local warlord Zhang Xueliang , and former \u201c bandits \u201d who indulged in extortion and raids .\nThe number of \u201c bandits \u201d is notably large , accounting for almost half of the total number of resistance fighters in Manchuria .\nMost resistance members were not motivated by nationalism .\nWhile it is true that the Communists took a nationalist stance in their resistance against Japan , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no particular political allegiance were motivated by nationalism and dedicated themselves to a nationalist cause ( Mitter 2000 , 190-203 ) .\nThe victor narrative depicts the war as a Communist victory against Japanese imperialism .\nIn the Mao era , the Communist leaders did not use the narrative of national humiliation ; rather , they used a Marxist theory of class struggle to explain the national proletarian struggle against foreign imperialist foes .\nThe victory of the Communist revolution was glorified as the great liberation of Chinese people from the oppression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mao therefore became the great savior of the Chinese nation ( Wang 2015 , 229 ) .\nThe theory of class struggle enabled the development of a narrative in the PRC \u2019 s war memory that defined China as a victor and the war as a struggle that transcended the boundaries of race , nation , and state ( Gao 2015 , 81 ) .\nThe narrative of \u201c China as a victor \u201d continued into the post-Mao era .\nOn 7 July 1987 , the 50th Anniversary of the Marco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee , reiterated the position that China was a victor in the war : the war is a \u201c great turning point in the historical development of the Chinese nation from decline to rejuvenation , \u201d China \u201c for the first time achieved a complete victory against imperialist aggression , \u201d and the Chinese \u201c as a semi-colonial weak nation created a miracle of defeating an imperialist power \u201d ( Ren min ri bao 1987 , 1 ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 , this victory narrative was re-articulated as an integral part of the \u201c Chinese Dream , \u201d a discourse actively promoted by the CCP to reconstruct Chinese nationalism .\nTo fulfill the \u201c Chinese Dream , \u201d China must take three steps of \u201c standing up , \u201d \u201c growing rich , \u201d and \u201c becoming strong.\n\u201d As the first step in the direction towards Chinese rejuvenation , the victory of the war takes on a symbolic significance .\nYet the death of Mao in 1976 not only marked the formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the beginning of the transition from class-based revolutionary ideology to nation-centered patriotism in China .\nOne locus of this new patriotism has been an emphasis on China \u2019 s wartime victimization at the hands of the invading Japanese Imperial Army .\nThis victim-centric view of history is not limited just to China but is also part of broader post-colonial and post-Cold War trends globally .\nIn post-Mao China , narratives of victimization and national humiliation by the Japanese are often found in history textbooks and media coverage .\nAnd in textbooks approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d was expanded even further to blame Japan ( and the West ) for China \u2019 s traumatic and humiliating experiences in the past hundred years lasting from the First Opium War ( 1839-1842 ) to the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War .\nIn newspapers , too , reports about Chinese victimization far exceeded those on China \u2019 s victory in the war which prevailed in previous decades .\nThe data of reports in newspapers from 2005 to 2015 shows that the number of reports about Chinese victimization such as the Nanjing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as reports about battles in the war ( Wang 2016 , 32-33 ) .\nThe victim narrative focuses on quantifying Chinese suffering in detail .\nCoverage of Japanese atrocities in the war tends to concentrate on the process of determining the number of victims , resembling what Coble has called \u201c a numbers game , \u201d in which the goal seems to maximize the number of victims ( Coble 2007 , 404 ) .\nIn the immediate aftermath of the war , the Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek announced that the war had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of estimated casualties increased dramatically under Communist rule .\nIn the Mao era , the CCP declared that 9.32 million Chinese were killed in the war .\nThat number remained unchanged for many years .\nThen , in 1995 , Jiang Zemin , the general secretary of the CCP , raised the death toll to a rough estimate of 35 million , and this has been the official Chinese figure ever since ( Gries 2004 , 80 ) .\nIt should be noted that identifying the number of victims by the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-1949 periods .\nThe official number of 300,000 Nanjing Massacre victims claimed by the Communists , for instance , was not their own invention , but rather emerged from the war crimes trials conducted by the Nationalists in the late 1940s .\nThematic Focus : Communists , Nationalists and Japan in the War The Communists , Nationalists and Japan are the main actors in the war , and each has been remembered in specific ways in the PRC .\nThe Communists have been remembered as the national savior .\nThis way of remembering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c bulwark \u201d ( zhongliu dizhu ) discourse that was first proposed by Mao in 1945 and is today actively promoted by the CCP .\nThe CCP has so far produced numerous reports , books , and documentaries to construct a myth that the Communists served as the backbone force in the war .\nThe \u201c bulwark \u201d narrative distinguishes between a front dominated by the Nationalists and a rear in which the Communists were dominant .\nIt claims that these two battlefields are interrelated and interdependent .\nThe rear outweighs the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance of the war .\nThe essential role of the Communists in the war is justified on the grounds of the political position that it took .\nThis narrative asserts that the Communists actively proposed and defended the United Front , which was formally established in 1937 , with the Nationalists throughout the war .\nWithout their relentless efforts to unite with the Nationalists to fight Japan , it would have been impossible for China to eventually win the war ( Liang 2005 , 37-43 ) .\nIt appears that the \u201c bulwark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to its political position and less to its military engagement during the war .\nThere is no doubt that the Communists fought guerrilla warfare with Japan at the \u201c rear , \u201d but a comparison of the military engagement by the Communists and the Nationalists would indicate the prominent role of the Nationalists on the battlefield .\nThe Communists launched one major military operation against Japan ( Wang 2000 , 166 ) , while the Nationalists fought twenty-three campaigns between 1937 and 1945 ( Van de Ven 2003 , 210 ; Wang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , the \u201c bulwark \u201d narrative politicizes a way of remembering the war that honors the Communists for its contributions .\nIn contrast to the role of the Communists as national savior , the Nationalists have been remembered much less positively in the political discourse of the PRC .\nThis was particularly the case in the Mao era when the central government systematically delegitimized memories of the Nationalists \u2019 contributions to the war effort .\nThe Nationalists were stigmatized as a class enemy that had betrayed the United Front , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insignificant .\nBeginning in the 1950s , the government obstructed the public commemoration of the Nationalists by demolishing shrines , cemeteries , and monuments .\nThese commemorative sites were initially built by the Nationalist government during the war in commemoration of the Nationalists \u2019 soldiers who died during the war ( Chang 2012 , 1-46 ) .\nUnder the Communist regime , these sites were classified as counterrevolutionary relics and became immediately subject to systematic demolition .\nIn consequence , cemeteries of Nationalist soldiers suffered severe damage .\nThe tombstones of thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were exhumed and thrown away ( Tsui 2020 ) .\nBeginning in the 1980s , the CCP discarded the old narrative , which mainly focused on the purported Nationalist betrayal of the United Front .\nInstead , the new narrative gave a more positive evaluation of the Nationalists \u2019 contribution in the war .\nThis narrative no longer emphasized the ideological and political conflict between the Communists and the Nationalists , but it redefined the Nationalists as an indispensable force in the resistance that had made sacrifices for national liberation .\nSome Nationalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many generals who had been discredited by the CCP during the Mao years ( Coble 2007 , 402 ; Weatherley and Zhang 2017 , 120 ) .\nTextbooks published in the late 1980s for the first time included the Nationalists-led military campaigns against Japan .\nNew war films also portrayed the Nationalists in a more positive light ( He 2007 , 57 ) .\nMuseums exhibited photographs and historical relics of former Nationalist generals and soldiers .\nOne major reason for the change in narrative can be attributed to the PRC \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBeijing adopted a conciliatory strategy to lure Taiwan into an agreement of reunification with the PRC .\nThe Nationalists , then the ruling party in Taiwan , were regarded as an ally rather than a foe for Beijing as Taiwan emerged as a multiparty democracy .\nThe reunification with Taiwan had now become a question of national pride .\nThis strategy also aimed to forge a shared historical consciousness between mainland China and Taiwan and to counter the tendency among Taiwanese nationalists towards disconnecting Taiwan \u2019 s history and culture from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the PRC \u2019 s remembering of the Nationalists is also evident in the representation of the Nationalists in museums .\nIn general , the exhibitions in public museums pay only limited attention to the role of Nationalists in the war .\nOne of the few public museums in the PRC that acknowledge the Nationalists is the Museum of War of Resistance against Japan in Beijing .\nThe hall of the museum acknowledges the role played by the Nationalists in the key battlefields of Taierzhuang , Taiyuan and Wuhan .\nZhang Zizhong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are commended , and the Nationalists are praised for their participation in Burma .\nThere is also a large Nationalist flag in one of the main halls right next to the picture of Chinese premier Zhou Enlai ( Weatherley and Zhang 2017 , 120 ) .\nA museum dedicated specifically to the Nationalists \u2019 war effort is one of the many museums included in the private Jianchuan Museum Cluster .\nIt is located in a historic small town on the outskirts of Chengdu , in southwestern China .\nAmong its thirty individual museums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Frontal Battlefield Hall \u201d is built to honor the legacy of the Nationalists .\nHowever , this hall is overshadowed by the \u201c Mainstay Hall , \u201d which is built specifically for honoring the Communists \u2019 war efforts .\nThe space of the \u201c Frontal Battlefield Hall \u201d is only half of the \u201c Mainstay Hall.\n\u201d The latter has a much richer variety of exhibits than the former , housing historical photographs , documents , and materials in the war .\nMemories of Japan \u2019 s role in the war have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resurrection in the PRC .\nIn the Mao era , the state discouraged memories of the war and Japanese war atrocities in general .\nInstead , the CCP constructed a heroic narrative of the war in which revolutionary martyrs and the victory of the revolution were worshipped .\nJapanese atrocities such as the Nanjing Massacre were rarely mentioned in popular publications such as textbooks and newspapers .\nEven Mao \u2019 s writings and speeches made no specific reference to the Nanjing Massacre ( Seo 2008 , 382 ) .\nThe government also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1962 , historians at Nanjing University completed a manuscript on the Nanjing Massacre , which put together photographs , statistics , and interviews with survivors .\nThe Chinese authorities immediately classified the manuscript instead of allowing it to be published ( Eykholt 2000 , 25 ) .\nIt was not until 1979 that the authorities released the manuscript as an internal document that was circulated , but only among a small number of high-level government officials ( Li and Huang 2017 , 15 ) .\nYang holds a different view that the Nanjing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as memoirs and museums in the Mao era ( 2018 ) .\nWhile the Chinese government did not completely erase the Nanjing Massacre from public memory in the Mao era , it is true that they avoided explicitly exposing Japanese atrocities in public .\nThere were hardly any published records of memoirs about the Nanjing Massacre during this period and the government did not build any museum to commemorate the victims of the Nanjing Massacre either .\nFurther , it remains unclear whether the Nanjing Massacre was widely remembered in the private sphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nanjing Massacre were killed by the persecution in the Mao era , and their cemeteries were demolished .\nIt is plausible that in the first three decades of the Communist rule , the Nanjing Massacre was largely neglected , if not forgotten , in public memory .\nIn the Mao era , the PRC policy towards Japan was designed to shelve the question of Japan \u2019 s aggression .\nIn the 1950s , the PRC was working to counteract the threat of the American containment policy against the Communist government in mainland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government in Taiwan .\nBeijing implemented \u201c people \u2019 s diplomacy \u201d towards Japan , a semi-official diplomatic campaign which was aimed to change Tokyo \u2019 s non-recognition of Beijing and undercut its security alliance with Washington ( He 2007 , 47 ) .\nTowards the end of the 1960s , the PRC began to cooperate with Japan as part of Mao \u2019 s strategy to confront the Soviet Union ( Reilly 2011 , 469 ) .\nFollowing the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations in 1972 , Beijing avoided historical disputes and reached a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese war responsibility-at least temporarily .\nDuring this period , it appears that the Chinese government was reluctant to confront Japan with the question of Japanese war responsibility .\nDiscourses of war memory drew a clear line between \u201c a handful of Japanese militarists \u201d and ordinary \u201c Japanese people.\n\u201d School textbooks never denounced Japan and the Japanese people , but instead used the terms \u201c Japanese imperialism \u201d or \u201c Japanese militarism \u201d to refer to the bearer of Japan \u2019 s war responsibility in an attempt to develop a favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 2007 , 47 ) .\nTo be sure , the differentiation between \u201c good \u201d Japanese and \u201c bad \u201d Japanese is a diplomatic tactic used by Beijing to facilitate the normalization of diplomatic relations between the PRC and Japan .\nIt also corresponds to Mao \u2019 s lines of class struggle which denounced Japanese militarists as a class enemy and sympathized with ordinary Japanese and their status as victims of their government \u2019 s misguided imperialist ventures .\nIt was only the emergence of historical revisionism in 1980s Japan that triggered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy .\nWhen the Japanese textbook controversy erupted in 1982 and again in 1986 , Beijing condemned what they perceived as the revival of militarist tendencies among Japanese leaders , and pressed Tokyo to correct the historical interpretations of textbooks in question .\nThe official visits by Japanese prime ministers to the Yasukuni Shrine in 1985 , 1996 and 2001 also triggered vehement criticism from Beijing ( Saito 2016 , 62-67 ) .\nFrom the 1980s on , Beijing contended with Tokyo over Japan \u2019 s approach to the commemoration of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical issues with Japan is clearly a departure from the conciliatory policy that the Chinese government pursued in the Mao era .\nThe PRC \u2019 s collective remembering of Japan \u2019 s role in the war fully revived in the post-Mao era .\nIn the 1980s , the Chinese government lifted the restrictions on the memories of Japanese war atrocities .\nDebates over Japan \u2019 s war atrocities began to appear in academic research , in general publications and in popular culture .\nMany academic works on Japan \u2019 s aggression in wartime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the war .\nResearch on the Nanjing Massacre , in particular , has developed rapidly with generous government sponsorship .\nIn 1984 , a large-scale investigation of survivors and witnesses of the Nanjing Massacre was conducted for the first time , and several research institutes were set up in Nanjing to advance this research .\nA research institute was established in 2011 in Shanghai to investigate the Tokyo Trial and Japanese war crimes .\nNumerous books intended for the general readership have also been released to promote the memory of the Nanjing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American journalist Iris Chang , Japanese historian Kasahara Tokushi , a leading authority of the Sino-Japanese War , and German businessman John Rabe , a witness of the Nanjing Massacre .\nJapanese veterans \u2019 trips to China for confession have been frequently covered in Chinese television .\nThe rejuvenation of remembering Japan \u2019 s role in the war in Chinese academia and mass media indicates the end of the class struggle-oriented policy adopted by the CCP during the Mao period .\nThe CCP now no longer favors a class-based memory of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Japanese imperialists , but instead promotes a way of remembering Japanese war responsibility that transcends class boundaries .\nIn other words , this new form of war memory assumes the unity of Japanese nation along national lines and transfers Japan \u2019 s war responsibility from the Japanese imperialists to the entire Japanese people .\nThe memoirs and oral accounts of Chinese veterans are private memories that describe the cruelty of the war and the human experiences in the war .\nThis alternative form of memory is markedly different from the official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroism and nationalism and to neglect the personal experiences of ordinary people as well as their attitudes towards the Chinese wartime regime .\nWhile the discourse of veterans \u2019 memoirs retains nationalist elements that emphasize collective sacrifice for national salvation in the war , it records some voices of family relationships and human affection .\nThese narratives deviate from those of the official war memory , but they should not be viewed as a marginalized form of alternative memory that fundamentally challenges the official state discourse of war memory .\nIt is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images of war portrayed in official memory discourses , but they are mostly products of state sponsorship that supports the official view of the war .\nTherefore , the accounts of memoirs and oral histories of veterans are essentially a variation or adjustment of the official war memory , which do not necessarily constitute counter memory that is produced to resist the official state discourse of war memory .\nIn this sense , these private memories of the war are unreliable representations of war experience .\nThey neither honestly reflect how veterans remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened on the battlefield in the war years .\nMemoirs of veterans were absent in the PRC \u2019 s public sphere until the early 1980s .\nThe lack of veterans \u2019 memoirs in the early period of the Communist rule can be attributed to state repression .\nSince the victory of the Communist revolution in 1949 , veterans , especially those who previously fought with the Nationalists , were not motivated to have their memoirs published because they were ostracized by the state .\nIn the 1950s , the CCP launched nationwide campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , labeling many of them \u201c rightists , \u201d \u201c counterrevolutionaries \u201d and \u201c enemies of people.\n\u201d As a result , veterans suffered from persecution , discrimination , and contempt .\nMany of them were humiliated and tortured to death , or committed suicide ( Diamant 2001 , 162-163 ; Weatherley and Zhang 2017 , 127-130 and 133-134 ) .\nThe veterans were in extremely difficult political circumstances , so it was highly unlikely for them to publish what they had been through in the war years .\nAfter the death of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted state agencies to record the wartime experiences of veterans .\nMany institutions began to invest resources to collect testimonies of veterans .\nIn the 1980s , compiling war testimonies of veterans was not an endeavor of national coordination , but mainly the work organized by local officials .\nMost compilations focused on the provincial or municipal experience of the war , so testimonies reflected more of a localized remembering of the war ( Moore 2011 , 411-412 ) .\nIn recent years , the CCP has emphasized the importance of unifying national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war as a historical turning point shifting the trajectory from national humiliation to national rejuvenation .\nVeterans \u2019 testimony of the war would help build a common national narrative and help shape a shared national identity .\nSince 2015 , the Chinese government has funded various government projects to collect and publish the testimonies of veterans .\nThus far , the National Office of Social Sciences under the Ministry of Propaganda has funded numerous research projects of this sort , including an extensive project on the oral history of veterans , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be completed in 2025 .\nThis project involves a wide range of government agencies , including the Historical Research Center of the Central Committee of the CCP , the State Administration of Press , Publication , Radio , Film , and Television , and the National Archives .\nVarious propaganda departments and the history offices of the CCP in central and local governments also support these investigations .\nMeanwhile , academic and cultural institutions across the country have put the collection of the oral testimonies of veterans on their research agenda .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University launched a project that records veterans \u2019 oral histories of the war .\nTwo other similar projects were also launched in 2015 and 2018 .\nThese projects include forms of social engagement as part of their research agenda .\nThe Nanjing Civil Anti-Japanese War Museum in collaboration with the research projects sponsored public participation through a series of workshops organized to teach the public how to collect oral histories ( Li 2020 , 33 ) .\nMany students have been recruited as volunteers from universities across the country to interview veterans .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the voices of veterans are accurately reflected in the recorded findings of these projects .\nThe state still closely monitors the research process , from selecting which veterans to interview to what interviewees are supposed to say for these projects ( Li 2020 , 33 ) .\nThe state-sponsored oral history projects of veterans have also facilitated the publication of war memoirs .\nSince the 2000s , many former servicemen have published their war experiences .\nThese works range from personal accounts of generals and soldiers to recollections of specific battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wen 2005 ; You 2011 ; Zhu 2010 ) .\nThere are also some works which record the experiences of veterans in specific provincial areas , such as Shanxi , Zhejiang , Hunan , and the northeastern provinces ( Fang 2012 ; Hu nan tu shu guan 2013 ; Li 2012 ; Zhang 2005 ) .\nIt is worth noting that many of these works are written not by the veterans , but rather by members of the oral history projects on the behalf of veterans .\nWhile the Chinese government has lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memoirs , the narrative of memoirs is still subject to tight government censorship .\nCensors do not allow veterans to portray the war as they experienced it , but instead require them to toe the official line , which construes the war as a heroic struggle against Japanese imperialism .\nAs a private form of war memory , however , the narratives in the memoirs of veterans inevitably clash with official historical narratives .\nSome memoirs lack accounts of the \u201c heroism \u201d of the Communists and the \u201c cowardice \u201d of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war memories , and even express sympathy for the Nationalists ( Moore 2011 , 412 ) .\nSuch narratives have often been extensively edited or even excised altogether by the publisher .\nThe censored memoirs tend to avoid descriptions of the effects of war on people , as well as expressions of veterans \u2019 grief of personal loss and deprivation during the war .\nThus , while the memoirs reflect to some extent the war experiences of the veterans , they are by no means genuine accounts that truthfully record how veterans remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they experienced the war .\nIn addition to the government efforts , the sense of urgency of the public to record and preserve wartime experiences resulted in an oral history documentary film project titled My War of Resistance ( wode kangzhan ) in the early 2010s , a period when some limited space became available for mild critical views of the official war memory to appear in Chinese media .\nThe documentary was produced by Cui Yongyuan , a popular host who had worked for national television .\nMy War of Resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period from 1931 to 1945 .\nThe project constitutes an enormous investment of time and energy .\nCui Yongyuan spent eight years and more than 130 million yuan to produce the documentary .\nIn the eight years since 2002 , Cui interviewed more than 3,500 people with direct war experiences , including 400 Nationalist and Communist veterans ( Weatherley and Zhang 2017 , 124 ) .\nThe documentary has two seasons with a total of sixty-two episodes .\nThe first season ( thirty-two episodes ) was screened on the Internet first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThen it was broadcast simultaneously on eighty-five TV stations across the country .\nThe second season ( thirty episodes ) was released in 2011 .\nEach episode has a thematic focus and lasts about thirty minutes .\nMy War of Resistance attempts to reproduce the overall situation of the Second Sino-Japanese War for the audience .\nThe unique feature of the documentary is that it records the experiences of \u201c little men , \u201d or the ordinary individuals in the war .\nIt tells the stories of different social groups such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborators who worked for the Japanese military in Japanese occupied zones .\nThe focus of the documentary is the stories of Nationalist veterans , most of whom were soldiers and low-level officials .\nThe documentary covers the daily life of Nationalist veterans in the war , including their love stories and suffering on the battlefield .\nThe documentary reveals the veterans as unhappy men when they recount their painful experiences .\nIn contrast to the heroic narratives of the official war memories , veterans \u2019 memories of the war experience in My War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of helplessness , frustration , and anguish .\nMemory of the Second Sino-Japanese War in the PRC is an endeavor of myth-making .\nThe main components of the myth are ways of remembering the Communists , the Nationalists and Japan .\nThe Communists are the backbone force of anti-Japanese resistance ; Japan represents evil ; and the role of the Nationalists has gradually changed from evil to positive , but still subordinate to the CCP .\nThe myth-making of the war is particularly evident in recent years when the PRC redefined the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame from eight years to fourteen years in school textbooks .\nThe PRC \u2019 s war memory is a mix of narratives of resistance , victim , and victor .\nIn the Mao era , the victor narrative dominated war memory .\nNarratives of resistance and victimhood gradually developed in the post-Mao era .\nThe resistance narrative is constructed to cultivate a sense of national belonging and establish national identity .\nThe victor narrative is essentially a revolutionary narrative of class struggle which often appears in official speeches at commemorative events .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , newspapers , academic publications , and discussions in intellectual circles .\nIt promotes a way of remembering Chinese suffering from the Japanese war atrocities in the war .\nThe victor narrative is based on class struggle , while the resistance and victim narratives are based on nationalism .\nThe PRC strictly controls the remembering and commemoration of the war , and the articulation of the war memory through media and institutions closely follows political conditions .\nIn the Mao era , the state implemented a policy of amnesia about the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe state banned the publication of research on this subject and silenced many veterans through political persecution .\nSince the 1980s , the ban has been lifted to a certain extent , but the narratives of war memory still largely conform to the

damage control .\nThe point is , the world has taken note that anti-Muslim politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is undermining the country \u2019 s democratic foundations .\nThe US state department last week flagged the gravity of the situation in India under the watch of the Modi government .\nTherefore , the big question is , whether the BJP \u2019 s damage control in the present case absolves the government of responsibility .\nThat remains a grey zone .\nTrue to a pattern , top government officials have disappeared .\nThe Indian public is by now used to such a drama where the government distances itself ostentatiously in the downstream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s cadres ( \u201c core constituency \u201d ) , and life moves on .\nBut in this age of the Internet , the international community is erudite enough to form own opinions and would know that the Indian state and the Party do not live in different planets .\nThe Indian establishment is in denial mode while it has been discernible that In West Asia , the tide of public opinion has perceptibly changed unfavourably for India in the recent years .\nThis has profound geo-strategic implications that would be felt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to the detriment of Indian interests and regional influence in the medium and long term .\nIf that happens , do not sit upon the ground and lament that China has outpaced India in \u201c soft power \u201d in its extended neighbourhood .\nThe West Asian regimes have traditionally taken a pragmatic outlook .\nThe UAE even allowed Prime Minister Modi to solemnise the opening of a Hindu temple in the Emirate .\nBut then , the UAE is a strange country with only something like 7 or 8 percent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has nothing by way of \u201c public opinion.\n\u201d Suffice to say , the actual feelings in the hearts and minds of the Arab ruling elite toward India in the recent years are hard to tell .\nThe entrenched opinion in India is that the Arab elites are rank opportunists and have scant regard for Islam themselves .\nIndians generally , including the expert opinion , viewed the Abraham Accords as a manifestation of the political chicanery of the ruling elites in the Muslim Middle East .\nThis is of course a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it basically confuses the Palestinian issue with the religiosity of the Muslim nations .\nSaudi Arabia \u2019 s refusal to join the UAE to recognise Israel signals the high level of sensitivity of the ruling family to domestic public opinion .\nNo doubt , such misunderstanding has wrought havoc with sections of the foreign and security policy elite and impacted the Indian policies over time .\nThere is even a body of opinion that India should align with Israel and participate in its divisive politics in the Gulf region .\nIt stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two BJP top officials last week would only have reflected a common perception in the high echelons of the party circles that so long as India does \u201c win-win \u201d business with the sheikhs , it can get away with anti-Muslim bigotry at home .\nBut that is sheer na\u00efvet\u00e9 .\nPan-islamism is a fact of history .\nThus , the government has been caught on the wrong foot by the strong backlash in the Muslim world .\nMost countries in the Gulf have reportedly made demarche at the diplomatic level .\nEven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c moderate Islam \u201d has denounced .\nThe social media reports say the West Asian nations demand \u201c public apology \u201d from the Indian government .\nSurely , the stance of Saudi Arabia and Iran will be the key templates here .\nBoth countries have not minced words in their condemnation .\nThat said , it is also significant that the Saudi Foreign Ministry \u201c welcomes the action taken by the BJP to suspend the spokeswoman from work.\n\u201d Equally , Iran \u2019 s foreign ministry has taken note after a meeting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter \u201c expressed regret over the issue and described as unacceptable any affront to

presidency comes amid simmering debate over which way he will take his country \u2019 s relations with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcos Jr. to pursue the same policy of relations with China as his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte , but it is likely that he will actually be much tougher against Beijing .\nOutgoing Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte improved relations with Beijing , projecting his country to enter a \u201c Comprehensive Strategic Cooperation \u201d with China .\nDespite the Chinese-Filipino territorial dispute , Duterte did not rely on the ruling of the International Court of Arbitration in The Hague , which even ruled that Beijing \u2019 s sovereign ambitions over the Spratly Islands were illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been any ruling from the International Court of Arbitration and took bilateral steps to improve relations with Beijing instead .\nIt is recalled that in 2017 , the Bilateral Consultation Mechanism on the South China Sea was agreed upon .\nThen , in 2018 during Chinese President Xi Jinping \u2019 s state visit to Manila , the two sides signed \u201c The Philippines-China MoU on Cooperation in Oil and Gas Development.\n\u201d Now in the final months of Duterte \u2019 s presidency , the Filipino Foreign Ministry sent a protest note to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South China Sea and against the Chinese coast guard violating the Philippines \u2019 Exclusive Economic Zone .\nMost recently , there have been three new Filipino coast guard outposts on these islands .\nDespite this , these issues are miniscule in the context of the friendly relations that the leaders of the Philippines and China currently have .\nThe majority of Filipinos are not enthusiastic about such friendly expressions as there is a distrust for the Chinese , as well as strong patriotic sentiment .\nIn this way , Marcos Jr. will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duterte against Beijing \u2019 s expansionist policy in the South China Sea .\nHowever , some observers say that under Marcos Jr. , the Philippines will become even closer to China as his family has a special relationship with the Asian Giant .\nMarcos Jr. \u2019 s father was the one to establish diplomatic relations with the People \u2019 s Republic of China in 1976 , and his parents even met with Chairman Mao Zedong .\nChinese leader Xi Jinping congratulated Marcos Jr. on his victory shortly after the election .\nIn his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as \u201c a figure in the creation , support and promotion of the China-Philippines friendship \u201d and expressed his wish that the two sides would continue to develop close ties .\nHowever , it does appear that his parents \u2019 special relationship with Beijing will not interfere in his policy of maximizing Filipino demands in the South China Sea .\nOn May 26 , speaking to television reporters , Marcos Jr. vowed to rely on the 2016 International Court of Arbitration ruling to assert \u201c our territorial sovereignty against Beijing \u2019 s ambitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the time , he stressed : \u201c Our sovereignty is sacred , and we will not give in in any way .\nWe will not allow anyone to trample on even a square millimeter of our maritime sovereignty.\n\u201d The president-elect added that he would resolve the issue through diplomacy , \u201c consistently and firmly.\n\u201d Manila has always been a military ally of the United States , despite all of Duterte \u2019 s sometimes harsh statements against Washington .\nIn this way , the Philippines enjoys a unique position where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States in some global and/or regional issues .\nIt is no coincidence that there are now hints from Beijing to Manila reminding of their previous methods of discussing territorial disputes whilst boosting economic cooperation .\nAs Beijing would rather minimize the importance of the territorial dispute in its bilateral relations with the Philippines , it could allow the US to re-establish its influence in the country as Manila finds far more importance in the issue .\nWhereas China can offer economic opportunity and benefit at the price of sidelining differences in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong diplomatic support on the territorial dispute , something that would surely spark Manila \u2019 s interest .\nIt is clear that economic cooperation and joint exploitation of resources in the South China Sea is a good way to develop relations between countries .\nAlthough China could blame nationalist ambitions in the Philippines as hindering a long-term sustainable peace , stability and economic development in the region , Manila does have a right to make use of what it is entitled to .\nBy ignoring such a major issue for the Philippines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US to exploit and therefore have a greater say in South China Sea matters

\u201d but rather specifically to \u201c win against China , \u201d thus confirming Beijing \u2019 s longstanding claims that Washington has been provoking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal political affairs recognized as such by even the US and its official recognition of the One China Policy .\nThe New York Times in a May 7 , 2022 article titled , \u201c US Presses Taiwan to Buy Weapons More Suited to Win Against China , \u201d would claim : The Biden administration is quietly pressing the Taiwanese government to order American-made weapons that would help its small military repel a seaborne invasion by China rather than weapons designed for conventional set-piece warfare , current and former US and Taiwanese officials say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s defenses has grown in urgency since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine ordered in late February by President Vladimir V. Putin .\nThe war has convinced Washington and Taipei that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan in the coming years is now a potential danger \u2014 and that a smaller military with the right weapons that has adopted a strategy of asymmetric warfare , in which it focuses on mobility and precision attacks , can beat back a larger foe .\nIn reality , after 8 years of intense training of over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billions of dollars worth of arms , Ukraine is no more able to repel Russian military operations amid the current conflict there than Taiwan will be able to do in any future conflict with the mainland even with Washington \u2019 s \u201c re-examination \u201d of Taiwan \u2019 s military capabilities and the adjustment of arms shipped to the breakaway island province .\nThe New York Times , like the vast majority of the Western media , claims that Ukraine has \u201c defeated \u201d Russia in critical battles , citing Kiev .\nIn reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and NATO spent 8 years arming and training was unable to stop Russia from securing cities from Kherson in Ukraine \u2019 s south all the way to the Donbas region , creating a land bridge from Crimea to the Russian Federation \u2019 s borders .\nAmong these cities includes Mariupol , presenting another example of Ukraine \u2019 s military failing in combat despite the extensive training and arms transfers the US military and its Western allies provided Ukraine since 2014 .\nUkraine \u2019 s military is also clearly unable to prevent Russia from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preparing for the encirclement and either destruction or capture of tens of thousands of Ukrainian forces along the line of contact between them and the militias of the Donbas region .\nTaiwan is a fraction of the size , population , and military strength of Ukraine .\nNothing the United States and its allies can do will ever change that nor the fact that each passing year the Chinese mainland \u2019 s military capabilities grow by leaps and bounds not only in terms of securing their own domestic objectives , but obtaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States .\nWhile Western publications like the New York Times claim that Washington \u2019 s strategy of arming and training Taiwanese forces is meant to defend the island , in reality it is merely meant to bleed China at Taiwan \u2019 s expense and entirely on Washington \u2019 s behalf \u2013 not unlike what is playing out in Ukraine right now .\nWhile the White House publicly denies it is waging a proxy war with Russia through Ukraine it is abundantly obvious that from 2014 onward , that is precisely what Washington prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now .\nThis has been openly admitted by sitting US representatives .\nUS Congressman Daniel Crenshaw , for example , in response to criticism for his vote on $ 40 billion in aid to Ukraine openly claimed : Investing in the destruction of our adversary \u2019 s military , without losing a single American troop , strikes me as a good idea .\nThus , just as Washington attempts to fight Russia to the last Ukrainian in Eastern Europe , the US is openly preparing the battlefield in the Indo-Pacific region to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn May of last year and for many years before that , upon the US State Department \u2019 s own website ( archived ) regarding US-Taiwan relations , the US State Department would explicitly note : The United States and Taiwan enjoy a robust unofficial relationship .\nThe 1979 U.S.-P.R.C .\nJoint Communique switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing .\nIn the Joint Communique , the United States recognized the Government of the People \u2019 s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China , acknowledging the Chinese position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taiwan is part of China .\nThe same webpage would also note : The United States does not support Taiwan independence .\nMaintaining strong , unofficial relations with Taiwan is a major U.S. goal , in line with the U.S. desire to further peace and stability in Asia .\nThe 1979 Taiwan Relations Act provides the legal basis for the unofficial relationship between the United States and Taiwan , and enshrines the U.S. commitment to assist Taiwan in maintaining its defensive capability .\nThe United States insists on the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status quo by either side , and encourages both sides to continue their constructive dialogue on the basis of dignity and respect .\nWashington \u2019 s recognition of the One China Policy in 1979 was key in securing Beijing \u2019 s support against the Soviet Union .\nUpon the collapse of the Soviet Union the US has incrementally backtracked on the agreement , blatantly violating it including through the placement of US troops on Taiwan .\nThe US government \u2019 s Voice of America platform in 2021 would report in their article , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Taiwan This Year , \u201d that : The United States has doubled its unofficial military presence in Taiwan over the past year in what specialists describe as the latest signal to China that Taiwan \u2019 s future remains a priority .\nMore recently , the US State Department has deleted key facts regarding its One China Policy .\nThe edited version claims : The United States has a longstanding one China policy , which is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act , the three US-China Joint Communiques , and the Six Assurances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have diplomatic relations with Taiwan , we have a robust unofficial relationship as well as an abiding interest in maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait .\nConsistent with the Taiwan Relations Act , the United States makes available defense articles and services as necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability .\nThe United States continues to encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait differences consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people on Taiwan .\nDeliberately omitted is any admission or explanation as to what \u201c the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Six Assurances \u201d actually represent or any explicit denouncement of US support for Taiwanese independence , creating both greater \u201c ambiguity \u201d regarding Wasington \u2019 s policy toward Taiwan and the mainland , as well as creating more diplomatic room for the US to eventually shift over to promoting Taiwanese independence .\nThe blatant provocation and deliberate threat America \u2019 s recent activities in and around Taiwan represent to Chinese national security is part of a familiar pattern of US encroachment \u2013 a similar pattern the US demonstrated along Russia \u2019 s peripheries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately leading to the conflict now unfolding within Ukraine \u2019 s borders .\nA similar conflict with China either directly fought by the US or by proxy ( or both ) is more than mere speculation .\nIt is the product of years of US foreign policy laid out in papers produced by and for the US government and its military .\nOne such paper , published in 2016 by the RAND Corporation titled , \u201c War with China : Thinking Through the Unthinkable , \u201d commissioned by the Office of the Undersecretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the RAND Arroyo Center \u2019 s Strategy , Doctrine , and Resources Program noted : We postulate that a war would be regional and conventional .\nIt would be waged mainly by ships on and beneath the sea , by aircraft and missiles of many sorts , and in space ( against satellites ) and cyberspace ( against computer systems ) .\nWe assume that fighting would start and remain in East Asia , where potential Sino-US flash points and nearly all Chinese forces are located .\nThe window of opportunity for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and potentially win stretches from 2015 to 2025 .\nAmong the flash points mentioned in the paper is Taiwan .\nThe paper is confident that such warfare would not turn nuclear : It is unlikely that nuclear weapons would be used : Even in an intensely violent conventional conflict , neither side would regard its losses as so serious , its prospects so dire , or the stakes so vital that it would run the risk of devastating nuclear retaliation by using nuclear weapons first .\nWe also assume that China would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cyberspace , given its minimal capability to do so with conventional weapons .\nIn contrast , US nonnuclear attacks against military targets in China could be extensive .\nHowever , because of China \u2019 s growing military capabilities and the likelihood that fighting would grind into a stalemate , the paper examines non-military factors it anticipates would benefit the US over China : The prospect of a military standoff means that war could eventually be decided by nonmilitary factors .\nThese should favor the United States now and in the future .\nAlthough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to China \u2019 s could be catastrophic and lasting : on the order of a 25\u201335 percent reduction in Chinese gross domestic product ( GDP ) in a yearlong war , compared with a reduction in US GDP on the order of 5\u201310 percent .\nEven a mild conflict , unless ended promptly , could weaken China \u2019 s economy .\nA long and severe war could ravage China \u2019 s economy , stall its hard-earned development , and cause widespread hardship and dislocation .\nChina might regard the price of losing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , Taiwan as so high that it would endure the costs of an intense , and perhaps lengthy , conflict .\nBroadly speaking , as prospects of either side clearly winning decline , as might be the case in coming years , both sides ought to place greater weight on the costs of fighting\u2014a key reason why both must rigorously think through what consequences a war could have .\nThe ongoing conflict in Ukraine provides a living laboratory to do precisely that , \u201c rigorously think through what consequences a war could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proxy war fought by the US through Taiwan .\nThe US government and the Western media claim that the unfolding conflict in Ukraine serves as a warning for China .\nThey claim the conflict demonstrates Western resolve and the military potency of Western-trained troops .\nHowever , in reality , the only fact demonstrated is the danger Western proxies pose to the national security of targeted nations like Russia and China and the absolute necessity to decisively and completely eliminate those threats .\nThe Western media continues to portray Ukraine as \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis is done to continue hostilities and dissuade Kiev from pursuing peace long after any feasible chance passes of defeating Russia militarily ( which passed before the conflict even began ) .\nUpon careful examination of the above-mentioned New York Times article , there is no logical or convincing explanation as to how Taiwan would ever in any conceivable way \u201c repel \u201d a potential military operation launched from the mainland .\nWhat the US and its partners are preparing Taiwan for instead is a similarly vain proxy war meant to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the US ever having to get directly involved .\nTaiwan as it is known today , would disappear in the rubble of modern warfare .\nEven if the US does eventually get involved , it hopes Chinese military capabilities will be significantly degraded when that happens because of the immense amount of military hardware transferred to Taiwan .\nAn additional bonus for the US is the immense profits this will make its arms industry .\nAs Washington continues pushing Taiwan closer and closer to conflict with the mainland , it is able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely Japan and Australia , to likewise purchase a larger amount of US weaponry .\nUltimately , and as the conflict in Ukraine illustrates , the US is not underwriting peace and stability around the globe , it is undermining it .\nIt is almost universally recognized , even across the West , that the current conflict in Ukraine stems from the US-led expansion of NATO after the Cold War ended .\nIt is likewise obvious that Washington \u2019 s insistence on violating its own One China Policy agreement with Beijing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now a growing US military presence on and around the island , that it is the US raising the likelihood of war , daily , by deliberately and increasingly threatening Chinese national security in ways that if reciprocated would never be tolerated by Washington .\nOnly time will tell what final lessons the conflict in Ukraine will teach both the West who provoked it , or Russia who was dragged into it , and how it may shape US provocations in the Indo-Pacific region and more specifically , in regards to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Note to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on

Indonesia as a key priority for his government .\nDespite living on the edge of the largest and fastest developing economies and societies on the planet , Australia has been far too lazy , shortsighted , and miserly about truly engaging with Asia .\nOur current woes with Chinese trade bans point to a failure to engage more broadly with both China and the rest of Asia .\nUnder Penny Wong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trade has the potential to play a critical role in securing Australia \u2019 s broader security interests .\nWong \u2019 s personal backstory , as well as her formidable intellect , will be key assets in our engagement with Asia .\nThe challenges facing the new defense minister \u2013 understood to be Richard Marles \u2013 intersect tightly with those facing Wong .\nThe shocking invasion of Ukraine by Russia , and the unexpected course of the war , contain many lessons for Australia .\nThe first is the importance of international alliances and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European Union .\nPrior to Russia \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine , it was easy to be critical of NATO and the EU , and question their utility and substance .\nNot any more .\nThe Quad , AUKUS , ANZUS , and the Five

are as critically important to defense and security as tanks , trucks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White Paper , likely to be released in 2023 , is going to be shaped by both the rise of China and the decline of Russia .\nThe experiences of the war in Ukraine , the critical role of logistics , the utility of certain kinds of equipment such as tanks , and the impact of organizational culture will be closely

ouster in a parliamentary no-confidence motion , the elected leader explosively claimed that the United States was orchestrating a \u201c foreign conspiracy \u201d to drive him from power .\nThose claims were rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elevated Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as well as the military top brass that previously backed the cricket star turned politician in what many saw as a civil-military hybrid regime .\nWashington also denied the conspiracy allegations , which Khan claimed were the upshot of his refusal to allow the US access to Pakistan military bases after its withdrawal from Afghanistan .\nKhan was also notably in Moscow for talks with Vladimir Putin the same day Russian tanks rolled across the Ukrainian border .\nSo when Inter-Services Intelligence ( ISI ) spy chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington with top officials including National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) director William Burns , some observers wondered if the US is indeed starting to have its way again in Pakistan .\nAccording to Pakistani diplomatic sources , Anjum \u2019 s visit focused on Afghanistan \u2019 s security situation under nine months of Taliban rule , including in regard to the emergence of new , low-scale anti-Taliban armed resistance led by Ahmad Masoud \u2019 s National Resistance Front and a host of other groups .\nISI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US CIA head William Burns reportedly see eye-to-eye on Afghanistan .\nImage : Screengrab / NDTV Those same sources say Anjum \u2019 s top-level visit consolidated a new \u201c Pak-US convergence \u201d around Afghanistan \u2013 a merging of interests driven in part by Pakistan \u2019 s own deteriorating ties with the Taliban over its unwillingness to contain the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) , an insurgent group also known as the \u201c Pakistan Taliban \u201d that has recently ramped up attacks on Pakistani security forces from Afghan soil .\nAnjum was in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bilawal Bhutto Zardari \u2019 s visit on May 17 , where he met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and attended a food security conference organized in response to the chaos and inflation Russia \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine has wrought on global grain markets .\nThe Bilawal-Blinken meeting , where Afghanistan also reportedly dominated the agenda , marked a more symbolic show of warming US-Pakistan relations in the wake of Khan \u2019 s departure .\nIt also raised new hope in Islamabad that Washington will lend its support to a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package to avoid a national default .\nPakistan \u2019 s flagging ties with China , which has made major investments in the country via the $ 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) , a key plank of the Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) , has provided the US a diplomatic opening for re-engagement , the same Pakistani diplomatic sources say .\nBilateral relations have foundered largely over the CPEC , with Pakistan repeatedly asking Beijing to no avail for restructured terms on infrastructure-related loans , and China raising concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-country interests , including in restive Balochistan province where it holds a 40-year lease on the port at Gwadar .\nRelations reportedly hit a new low when three Chinese tutors attached to a Beijing-sponsored Confucius Institute at Karachi University were killed in a suicide bomb attack on April 26 .\nChina has since withdrawn its nationals from all Confucius Institutes across the country due to security concerns .\n\u201c Chinese confidence in Pakistan \u2019 s security system \u2019 s ability to protect their citizens and their projects is seriously shaken , \u201d said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Senate \u2019 s Defense Committee , after the Karachi attack .\n\u201c It has caused serious concern and understandable indignation in China .\n\u201c More so , the pattern of attacks is so recurring and it \u2019 s clear the Pakistani promises of \u2018 foolproof security \u2019 are mere words , not matched by countermeasures on the ground , \u201d he told local media .\nMushahid recently led a Pakistani delegation to the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan to address China \u2019 s growing security concerns .\nChina has withdrawn all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reaction to rising attacks on its nationals .\nImage : Twitter Tensions with top investor China come as Pakistan \u2019 s economy teeters towards collapse .\nOn May 17 , the Pakistani rupee hit an all-time low of 196 to the US dollar due to fast-falling foreign exchange reserves and big debts due to international lenders including Chinese financial institutions who refuse to reschedule the credits .\nRecently snubbed by Pakistan \u2019 s traditional benefactors in Saudi Arabia and China , Sharif \u2019 s government is looking again to the US-influenced IMF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first acts in office , Sharif sent Finance Minister Miftah Ismail \u2013 who holds a PhD degree in public finance from the University of Pennsylvania \u2013 to Washington to revive Pakistan \u2019 s IMF program .\nMiftah not only revived the IMF program , which stalled due to Khan \u2019 s refusal to meet its terms on fuel and other market-distorting subsidies , but also convinced the fund to expand its lending from $ 6 billion to $ 8 billion .\n\u201c The IMF program is crucial since we are not expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Saudis at the moment , \u201d said a Pakistani diplomat who requested anonymity .\nSignificantly , Pakistan \u2019 s top brass are also reportedly supportive of improved ties with the US , its long-time partner until relations cratered over the Afghanistan war .\nThat \u2019 s in part because the Pakistan military , which backed the Khan regime for years and is now also being blamed for pushing the economy to the brink of bankruptcy , recognizes a US-backed IMF bailout is the likely the only way to avoid collapse .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early April when Chief of the Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa said in an early April speech delivered at a security conference in Islamabad that Pakistan \u2019 s ties with the US were \u201c long and excellent.\n\u201d Bajwa reminded his audience that the \u201c best equipment \u201d possessed by the Pakistan military comes from the US , spelled not China , and that Pakistan \u2019 s largest export market is the US , likewise not China .\n\u201c Pakistan \u2013 including the Pakistan military \u2013 has multiple reasons to rebuild its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistani diplomatic source said .\nFor the US , Pakistan \u2019 s troubled ties with the Taliban , its rising tensions with Beijing and its acute need for IMF financial assistance present a sudden and unique opportunity to recalibrate ties with Islamabad and develop a new , mutually beneficial strategy vis-a-vis the Taliban .\nWith the emergence of a low-scale armed resistance against the Taliban in Afghanistan by fighters \u2013 namely Ahmad Masoud and Amrullah Saleh \u2013 with past strong ties to the West , Pakistan could serve as a conduit for extending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes of destabilizing the Taliban .\nAs Bilawal stressed in an interview with US media , Pakistan has been pressing the Afghan Taliban to eliminate the TTP \u2013 which seeks to overthrow Pakistan \u2019 s secular government and establish an Islamic emirate as the Taliban has in Kabul \u2013 with no meaningful progress made so far .\nPakistan \u2019 s and China \u2019 s interests in Afghanistan diverge on the point .\nUnlike the US , China supports the Taliban \u2019 s exclusive dominance in Afghanistan .\nThat \u2019 s largely because its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-China , Uighur-led East Turkestan Islamic Movement ( ETIM ) to launch attacks on Chinese interests in Afghanistan and across the border in Xinjiang , China \u2013 where Beijing holds one million-plus Uighurs in so-called \u201c vocational camps \u201d some rights groups see as a campaign of \u201c genocide.\n\u201d While the Taliban has assured Beijing it will contain ETIM , the militant group in Kabul has made no such assurances to Islamabad on the TTP .\nInstead , the Taliban acted as an intermediary in brokering a short-lived ceasefire between Khan \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China \u2019 s interests increasingly aligned with a strong and stable Taliban , and with Pakistan \u2019 s ties with Beijing stressed and strained , it is logical for Sharif \u2019 s new government to look towards the US to bolster its security and save its economy as it teeters on the brink on both fronts

with the world \u2019 s second-largest economy , China .\nChina-Indonesia ties not only occur between governments and businesses .\nSeveral Indonesian political parties and the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sole ruling party are also forging ties .\nThis phenomenon is quite interesting given the world \u2019 s most populous Muslim majority has held a strong anti-communist position since the mid-1960s .\nMy ongoing research about the actors involved in China-Indonesia relations reveals the mutual benefits the Chinese Communist Party and Indonesia \u2019 s political parties gain from these collaborations .\nIndonesia banned communism in 1966 ; it was considered a threat following an alleged coup attempt by the country \u2019 s Communist Party ( PKI ) .\nIn the early 2000s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wahid , failed in his attempt to revoke the ban .\nThe stigma against communism in Indonesian society remains .\nThis is why most political parties in Indonesia do not want to be associated with China due to its communist ideology .\nUnlike China \u2019 s one ruling party system , Indonesia is a multi-party country .\nThere are two broad camps : secular and Islamic parties .\nThe first camp includes the current ruling party PDIP ( Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle ) , Democratic Party ( Partai Demokrat ) , Golkar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gerindra ( Great Indonesia Movement Party ) and NasDem ( National Democrat ) .\nHowever , even Islamic parties that have had a long , tense history with communism since the early 1950s are reportedly pursuing ties with the Chinese Communist Party .\nAt least five Indonesian political parties have established ties with the CCP .\nThese include the country \u2019 s major parties the PDIP , Gerindra , the Democratic Party , Golkar , and the PKS .\nThe involvement of parties like the PKS and Gerindra is quite interesting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s growing power as a communist threat .\nIt \u2019 s also been reported the Islamic party PPP ( United Development Party ) has developed a relationship with the Chinese Communist Party , although it has rejected such claims .\nAs early as 2008 , Golkar \u2019 s members and Chinese Communist Party officials held a meeting to share experiences on party management .\nSince then , the two parties have been organising follow-up meetings between their high-ranking officials in Beijing and Jakarta .\nGolkar politician Ace Hasan Syadzily said that many parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have cultivated collaborations with the Chinese Communist Party .\nThe scope of this party-to-party cooperation ranges from meetings , exchanges on party organising , to regeneration .\nGolkar and the Chinese Communist Party \u2019 s meeting in 2008 resulted in a Memorandum of Understanding ( MoU ) covering all aspects related to the regeneration and party organising .\nMeanwhile , the PDIP and the CCP have organised several meetings to discuss cooperation to increase human and financial resources .\nIn 2013 , the PDIP sent 15 of its cadres to visit Shanghai , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s health care centres and learn about the development of agricultural sectors in China \u2019 s rural areas .\nIn their visits to Guiyang , delegates from the PDIP learned about how local governments fostered the development of Small and Medium Enterprises in the health industry .\nThey also attended a number of workshops on political party management .\nIn 2015 , PDIP \u2019 s chairwoman and Indonesia \u2019 s former president Megawati Soekarnoputri visited Shenzhen to inaugurate the Indonesia-China Cooperation Center building .\nThe building is named after her father , Sukarno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This visit further enhanced the PDIP \u2019 s relationship with the CCP .\nDuring the visit , Megawati spoke on a panels titled \u201c Political Leadership : New Consensus for Political Party \u201d , at the International Conference of Asian Political Parties forum in Beijing .\nChinese authorities also invited the PKS , the National Mandate Party ( PAN ) and the National Awakening Party ( PKB ) to conduct comparative studies , especially on the Hui Muslim Ethnic Autonomous Region in Ningxia , in an effort to maintain a positive image of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts on the Chinese Communist Party , Julia Bader and Christine Hackenesch , argue that from the CCP \u2019 s perspective , strengthening party-to-party relations with Indonesia could be part of its soft-power approach to increasing the legitimacy of its growing economic interests in the country .\nThere have been criticism of China among certain parties \u2019 members and supporters in Indonesia .\nChina sees this party-to-party cooperation as a way to improve its standing and a gateway for expanding its foothold .\nThe harmonious relationship will also bring opportunities for future Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build a good relationship with Indonesia \u2019 s ruling coalition party , especially in the lead up to Indonesia \u2019 s 2024 general election .\nFrom the perspective of Indonesian parties , the aim is more than just to maintain good relations but also to bring about projects in various sectors .\nThis also opens up opportunities for the Indonesian parties to become grant distributors , enabling them to gain political support from Islamic boarding schools and educational institutions .\nWith the 2024 election coming soon , collaborating with China may help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ensure Chinese investments in Indonesia in the future .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us

reading of local regulations .\nBut this method , used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palestinians , has become a weapon of choice for the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party in Uttar Pradesh , Madhya Pradesh , and Gujarat .\nOn June 12 , Muslim activist Javed Mohammed , a member of the Welfare Party of India , tasted such retributive justice in witnessing the family home demolished by the Prayagraj Development Authority ( PDA ) .\nThe actions were also inflicted on two other homes belonging to individuals accused of throwing projectiles after Friday prayers .\nSimilar measures have been implemented in Saharanpur and Kanpur .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thuggery , the measure is given a legal gloss in victimising the occupants .\nThey are the ones in the wrong , without the valid construction

Amendment Act .\nWhat , then , of the response to such brutal , extra-judicial punishments ?\nThe demolition of Javed \u2019 s home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians voice concerns about natural justice and the right to shelter .\nIn fact , outrage against such acts has been in short supply .\nSome television networks even went so far as to express delight at treatment they regarded as appropriate against mischief makers who had masterminded protests in Prayagraj .\nRahul Gandhi of the Congress Party preferred to focus on the unwanted attention of the Enforcement Directorate regarding money-laundering claims connected with the sale of the National Herald newspaper .\nAdded to the specious justification that the homes were illegally constructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revel in applying the brutal treatment .\nHis media adviser , Mrityunjay Kumar , showed little reluctance in celebrating the use of the bulldozer and promising more demolitions with this heralded weapon .\n\u201c Unruly elements remember , \u201d he tweeted , captioning a picture of a bulldozer doing its dastardly work , \u201c every Friday is followed by a Saturday.\n\u201d Some members of the legal fraternity have begged to differ .\n\u201c Even if you assume for a moment that the construction was illegal , which , by the way is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former Chief Justice of the Allahabad High Court , Govind Mathur , \u201c it is impermissible that you demolish a house on a Sunday when the residents are in custody.\n\u201d A number of lawyers have written to the current Allahabad High Court Chief Justice , pointing out that Javed \u2019 s home was actually in his wife \u2019 s name .\nNeither had received earlier notices of illegal construction , as claimed by the PDA , suggesting that due process had been denied .\nThe courts have become the logical , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nChallenges have been launched in the Supreme Court , the Allahabad High Court and the Madhya Pradesh High Court , though these cases remain in legal limbo .\nThe delay in judicial action has drawn criticism from legal commentators , with twelve figures including former Supreme Court and High Court justices urging Supreme Court Chief Justice NV Ramana to uphold its role as \u201c custodians of the Constitution \u201d .\n\u201c We hope and trust the Supreme Court will rise to the occasion and not let the citizens and the Constitution down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of judicial intervention in these cases has certainly preoccupied some Supreme Court justices , though they claim to eschew activism .\nSupreme Court Justice Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud , set to become Chief Justice come November , recently delivered a lecture at King \u2019 s College , London observing a \u201c growing litigious trend in the country \u201d that indicated

there are two museums that present different narratives of the 3.11 natural disaster and nuclear crisis .\nTEPCO \u2019 s Decommissioning Archive Center focuses on the nuclear accident , what its workers endured and provides rich details on the decommissioning process expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great East Japan Earthquake and Nuclear Disaster Memorial Museum focuses on how the lives of the prefecture \u2019 s residents were affected by the cascading 3.11 disaster .\nThe Archive elides many controversial issues that reflect badly on the utility while the Memorial conveys the human tragedy while addressing some of the controversies not covered in the Archive .\nTEPCO presents an evasive narrative at the Archive , but it is slickly packaged and casts the utility in the best light possible .\nThe Memorial is impressive in scope and conveys the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded to patrons \u2019 criticisms about controversial issues .\nMuseums are important sites for shaping public memory and promoting desired narratives , especially concerning controversial issues and events .\nThe goal is to influence how visitors think about and remember what have become collective memories , and thereby shape public discourse .\nThus , much is at stake in how the past is selected and represented at sites that commemorate the divisive past and assert interpretations of it .\nIt \u2019 s important to examine museums like texts , read between the lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , emphasized and distorted in the displays .\nTwo distinctive narratives about the Fukushima nuclear disaster feature in two museums in Fukushima Prefecture , the TEPCO Decommissioning Archive and the prefectural government \u2019 s Great East Japan Earthquake and Nuclear Disaster Memorial Museum .\nThe contrast is stunning if not predictable .\nThe strategy of the TEPCO facility is to elide awkward details and emphasize how its dedicated workers , at great personal risk , saved the day and how the utility is committed to cleaning up the mess and acting responsibly .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for TEPCO to burnish its reputation , but with this slick facility and some artful spin the Archive makes the best of the poor hand the utility dealt itself .\nThe prefectural museum focuses on the human element and how the natural and man-made nuclear disasters of 3.11 wreaked havoc on communities and families , endangered the health of evacuees and children , assigning blame for what was and what was not done while also trying to suggest that a brighter future for Fukushima is emerging .\nThe Memorial Museum is more engaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispassionate narrative that works to normalize and routinize the trauma while highlighting progress .\nMuseums are moving targets , as exhibits and panels are updated and revised , owing to public pressure in the case of the Memorial Museum and the evolving process of decommissioning for the TEPCO Archive .\nThe TEPCO Archive opened in late 2018 in the town of Tomioka , about 10 km south of the stricken reactors .\nIts stated purpose is to \u201c preserve the memories and records of the nuclear accident at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons learned , both within TEPCO and with society as a whole.\n\u201d ( Nippon.com 2020 ) Up to a point this is correct , but the remorse and lessons learned is overshadowed by the detailed exhibits and explanations about nuclear energy technology and the decommissioning process .\nThe archive \u2019 s pamphlet suggests that \u201c TEPCO has a keen sense of its responsibility to record the events and preserve the memory of the nuclear accident \u201d , but this is a selective memory that is more evasive than forthright about the causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOne exits the museum knowing more about how TEPCO and its workers were affected by the nuclear accident than how it affected the people living in the vicinity .\nThere is a collage of TEPCO workers specifying the number of people currently employed in Fukushima , 4,170 as of mid-April 2022 .\nThis display is there to underscore how important TEPCO remains to local communities , generating jobs in a depressed region .\nThe company has kept faith with its employees while betraying their hometowns .\nGood jobs are one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear plant in 1967 .\nThe government and utilities selected remote , depressed towns for siting reactors , offering lavish subsidies and well-paid jobs that were a lifeline for these communities .\n( Onitsuka 2012 ) They also promoted the myth of 100 % safety to reassure locals that there was nothing to worry about until they discovered it was a fairy tale with an unhappy ending .\nThe Fukushima Daiichi workers on site at the time of the meltdowns had to cope with fears of radiation contamination and uncertainty about how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cascading disaster that began with total loss of power on March 11 , 2011 due to the massive 13 meter tsunami triggered by the magnitude 9 earthquake .\nThis station blackout caused a cessation of reactor cooling systems and precluded automated venting of the hydrogen accumulating in the reactors \u2019 secondary containment buildings .\nAs the zirconium clad fuel rods heated up , they emitted hydrogen , but the staff had never practiced manual venting and had to spend valuable time figuring out how to do so due to poor training .\n( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 ) Sato Hiroshi , one of the men in the control room during the crisis , confirmed that nobody knew how to operate the venting manually and when they eventually tried the venting system proved inoperable .\n( Interview April 16 , 2022 ) The hydrogen explosions that ripped apart secondary containment structures in Unit 1 ( March 12 ) , Unit 3 ( March 14 ) and Unit 4 ( March 15 ) spread radioactive debris and injured some workers , hampering the emergency response .\nThe crisis atmosphere was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff worried about another tsunami and wondering what else might go wrong .\nHigh on that list was the possibility that the water in the spent fuel rod cooling pools adjacent to the reactor vessels might evaporate , causing a catastrophic explosion ; this was the nightmare scenario because the hydrogen explosions had shredded the secondary containment housing , leaving the pools exposed to the elements .\nThis worst-case scenario of a massive eruption of radiation with no containment would have forced any surviving emergency workers to flee the site and might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant manager Yoshida Masao had another nightmare scenario , referring to what he called a China Syndrome involving a \u201c nuclear fuel melt through \u201d penetrating all containment of the crippled reactors and releasing vast amounts of radiation exceeding the 1986 Chernobyl accident .\n( Asahi 2014 ) The situation was so dire he testified he felt he was likely to die .\nThe TEPCO Archive doesn \u2019 t delve into these worst-case scenarios about what might have happened .\nOne can only imagine how stressful and traumatizing this on-the-job training experience was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trauma narrative of 3.11 that is not prominently featured in public discourse because they are not seen as victims of this disaster but rather those responsible for the accident .\nAt the TEPCO Archive , I spoke with Sato Yoshihiro , one of the Fukushima 50 ( actually 69 workers ) who stayed on to manage the crisis while hundreds of others evacuated .\n( McCurry 2013 ) He was a control room deputy manager and involved in the failed venting efforts .\nThere is a video interview with him at the facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , but nothing about the manual venting .\nWhen asked , he said that the venting system failed even when they tried manually operating it and that there had not been adequate crisis emergency training .\n( Interview April 16 , 2022 ) Plant manager Yoshida Masao reached the same conclusion ; he and other plant workers were insufficiently trained and that was a key factor in the nuclear accident .\n( Asahi 2014 ) The Cabinet Investigation into the causes of the accident also highlights this deficiency .\n( Cabinet 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below attests , TEPCO acknowledges this critical shortcoming .\nSince 2011 there have been significant upgrades of reactor safety hardware , but doubts linger about how well workers are trained in crisis management and operation of disaster emergency systems .\nGiven TEPCO \u2019 s extensive institutionalized flaws and lax culture of safety along with dysfunctional internal and external communication that exacerbated the crisis , it is hard to be optimistic that sufficient improvements have been enacted in the ensuing decade .\n( Akiyama 2016 ) The Nuclear Regulation Authority ( NRA ) has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but has been lax on enforcing compliance , not rejecting any applications for extending the operating licenses of forty-year old plants , after asserting that this would be exceptional , and issuing approvals in cases where all safety upgrades had not yet been completed .\n( Kingston 2021 ) This appears to be yet another lesson from the 3.11 disaster about the dangers of wishing risk away that has not been taken to heart .\nThis institutionalized insouciance about safety is why citizens have sought and won lower court injunctions blocking restarts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been inadequate ; on appeal these injunctions have been overturned but even so , the lawsuits demonstrate that the nuclear energy industry has not yet regained public trust .\n( Johnson , Fukurai and Hirayama 2020 ) As the nuclear crisis grew increasingly dire , many plant workers drove away from the site and retreated to the Daini Plant about 12 km away , a sensible response to the evident dangers even as it raises questions about the broader implications for managing the risks of responding to a nuclear accident .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it appears that the plant manager \u2019 s instructions may have been misinterpreted or garbled as they passed down the line .\n( Asahi 2014 ) However , Yoshida believed that the workers who decamped to safety at the Daini Plant made the right call , although he maintains he intended they retreat to the rear area of the Daiichi Plant .\nIt \u2019 s important to note that the site is massive , about the same size as Central Park in New York .\nAt any rate those that stayed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an eponymous hagiographic film that focuses on how their heroic self-sacrifice saved the nation from what could have been a much more serious calamity .\nIt is striking how in the film Fukushima 50 ( 2018 ) the nuclear accident has been transformed into an uplifting story of bravery rather than a sordid saga of lax safety practices , regulatory capture and corporate cost cutting at the expense of public safety .\n( Diet 2012 ) It \u2019 s a deeply flawed and biased account of the nuclear accident , perpetuating myths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accident that was largely the utility \u2019 s fault abetted by slipshod government oversight .\n( Diet 2012 , Cabinet 2012 , RJIF 2012 ) TEPCO was widely reviled following the accident and even years afterwards employees I knew were not keen to let others know where they worked .\nGiven how important one \u2019 s job is to one \u2019 s identity in Japan , this too has been traumatizing .\nWhen the mandatory evacuation order was lifted in 2016 for Odaka , Sato \u2019 s hometown , he recalls worrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accident that had transformed a once prosperous community into a ghost town .\nApparently , those worries proved unfounded .\nPreviously , in an ill-advised act of hubris that generated a harsh public backlash , TEPCO issued a self-exonerating report about the accident in mid-2012 , asserting it was a Black Swan event that was sotegai ( beyond what could be anticipated ) although in house researchers knew of the tsunami risk and in the 1990s TEPCO had been alerted to the dangers of a station blackout potentially leading to a nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that position became untenable following three major investigations into the accident published in 2012 that emphasize TEPCO \u2019 s failure to improve disaster countermeasures despite numerous warnings , in-house and from government regulators .\n( Lukner and Sasaki 2013 ) .\nUntil October 2012 TEPCO tried to evade responsibility and muddy public perceptions by falsely implicating PM Kan but was pilloried for doing so and retracted this whitewash and issued a mea culpa at the insistence of an international team of experts brought in to review internal documents and the utility \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t explore this chapter of shirking , TEPCO \u2019 s employees probably feel victimized by the backlash generated by the attempted cover-up and the lingering image of skullduggery .\nWhile sympathetic to the story of traumatized plant workers , the Archive is perhaps most noteworthy for what is missing .\nThe collective and ongoing trauma of the nuclear refugees forced out of their homes , and the gutted communities and abandoned towns left behind , are not covered in the exhibits .\nThe shared sense of betrayal among the displaced is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences experienced by them and by Japanese throughout Japan who are now anxious about living in the shadow of nuclear power plants .\nPeople assumed that the scientists and officials knew what they were doing and would act responsibly to ensure safe operations , but that trust has been shattered .\nWandering into the Archive visitors encounter a progress report on decommissioning and the challenges of doing so .\nHowever , there is no reference to the spiraling cost to taxpayers now estimated to exceed $ 600 bn over the next four decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected and may extend that timeline and boost costs .\nThe imposing F Cube in the center of the spacious first floor presents a video explaining what decommissioning work is and the status of that effort while other panels assert that there is steady progress day-by-day .\nIt is an encouraging message that contradicts a steady stream of media reports about limited progress a decade on and various setbacks in decommissioning efforts .\n( Yamaguchi 2021 ) Still on the first floor , we see photos of the workers engaged in decommissioning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the reactors .\nThe display on waste treatment and storage of radioactive waste overlooks the government \u2019 s so far fruitless quest to secure a permanent waste storage facility .\nA video panel discusses measures for treating contaminated water that TEPCO keeps in over 1,000 large storage tanks on the plant site .\nThere is considerable controversy associated with this radiated water and what to do with it .\nBack in 2013 when Tokyo was bidding for the 2020 Olympics , PM Abe assured the International Olympic Committee that the water situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was untrue then and continues to be misleading now .\nThe notorious $ 325 million ice wall installed to halt the flow of water passing down from adjacent hills through the reactors into the ocean has not worked as planned .\n( Sheldrick and Foster 2018 ) There have also been numerous problems with the ALPS water decontamination system that is supposed to remove all but trace amounts of tritium so that the water can be safely dumped into the ocean .\nIn 2018 TEPCO suddenly announced that the treatment of stored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system had malfunctioned , a confidence sapping measure that further undermined confidence in TEPCO and its touted technologies .\n( Brown 2021 ) Fukushima \u2019 s beleaguered fishermen are unhappy about the government approved plans to dump TEPCO \u2019 s treated/contaminated water into the ocean starting in 2023 because the 2011 accident has dashed consumer confidence in the safety of their fish .\nHopes that these concerns would ebb over time have now faded with the high-profile dispute over ocean dumping that includes criticism from many Japanese citizens and domestic NGOs , international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea and China .\n( Brown 2021 ) The government has allocated JPY30 billion ( US $ 245 million ) to support the local fisheries industry and promises to buy seafood if demand declines due to consumer concerns , but these inducements have not convinced fishermen that the discharge of treated water won \u2019 t further tarnish the brand and reduce their income .\n( Kyodo 2022 ) It is common to hear locals rhetorically ask , \u201c If the water is so safe why not dump it in Tokyo Bay ?\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor where there is a clock shaped pedestal of 3.11 remembrance commemorating the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami .\nIt is part of the exhibit : \u201c Memory and record/Reassessment and lessons \u201d .\nThe video displayed nearby does open with an apology and dispassionate acknowledgement of responsibility that is an attempt to convey a level of remorse not evoked effectively by the other exhibits .\nBut much of the video focuses on the seismic event and TEPCO \u2019 s response to the accident , conveying the sudden rupture of routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On a curved wall display there is a timeline of the first eleven days of the accident , another panel summarizes the countermeasures taken to manage the accident while a time series chart sketches the disaster from the time of the tsunami until cold shutdown was achieved in December 2011 .\nVisitors also get a reactor-by-reactor review of how the accident unfolded and recreated scenes from inside the main control room for reactors 1 and 2 during the station blackout .\nThere is also an animation including water injection efforts by fire engines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a point we return to in discussing the prefectural museum .\nThe exhibit on the second floor that focuses on reassessment and lessons learned is striking for its brevity and breezy boosterism .\nVisitors learn that , \u201c Faithfully facing up to the accident we were unable to prevent , we are determined to increase the level of safety , from yesterday to today and from today to tomorrow.\n\u201d Left out is any discussion of the reasons why TEPCO was unable to prevent the accident and scant detail on how TEPCO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ostensibly earnest desire to do so .\nMedia reports about continued safety lapses and submission of falsified data in relation to TEPCO \u2019 s application to restart its Niigata nuclear power plant cast a shadow over the utility \u2019 s commitment to learning from , and acting on , the lessons of Fukushima .\n( Nikkei 2021 ) .\nTEPCO has lost public trust ( Rich and Hida 2022 ) and has shown limited capacity to regain it , even earning a stunning public rebuke from the NRA chair Tanaka in 2017 when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate a nuclear power plant .\n( Japan Times 2017 ) Just before one descends the stairs to the exit there is an illuminating message from TEPCO asserting that , \u201c We will pass on the genuine feedback received from the staff members who worked for the response to the accident , as \u2018 real voices , \u2019 to future generations.\n\u201d Here the museum is positioned as a site commemorating the trauma experienced by TEPCO \u2019 s employees and its mission of ensuring that their experiences are not overlooked .\nSato is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on-demand videos in which they share their experiences during the crisis .\nBy highlighting the difficulties endured by plant workers , and the trauma they share with local residents , the Archive encourages a more sympathetic view of TEPCO .\nIt is a sanitized and selective narrative that elides the damning findings of public investigations and the media , but creates the basis for \u201c reasonable doubt \u201d in the court of public opinion , especially as the details fade from collective memory .\nIn contrast to TEPCO \u2019 s facility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earthquake and Nuclear Disaster Memorial Museum opened in 2020 highlights the wider human consequences of the events of 3.11 , including the tsunami devastation and nuclear accident .\nThis sleekly designed glass-walled facility located on a barren tsunami-swept area close to the coast is part of the government \u2019 s lavishly funded Fukushima reconstruction and recovery effort .\nBetween the museum and the ocean is a derelict ruin of a house , preserved as a reminder of what the massive tsunami wrought .\nInside , the spacious three story museum features displays about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the gutting of once vibrant communities , and the fear and uncertainty generated by the nuclear disaster .\nIt too emphasizes lessons for the future but draws different ones than TEPCO and emphasizes the upheaval people experienced at the time , and dispiriting aftermath that lingers .\nDerelict ruin and new embankments in front of museum .\n( Credit : Jeff Kingston ) Just past the entrance an introductory short video on a large screen shows the tsunami sweeping through towns and pulverizing communities with footage of the hydrogen explosions at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious the situation was .\nIn terms of public memory , the radioactive plumes bursting from the reactor buildings launched the Fukushima nightmare .\nThe day after the third explosion , Emperor Akihito appeared in a televised address on March 16 , perhaps as a gesture of reassurance but also , given how extremely rare such appearances are , ramping up anxieties .\nThe footage of the hydrogen explosions and tsunami is repeated elsewhere in the museum .\nProminent symbols of the radioactive consequences of 3.11 are also displayed such as a hazmat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are high levels of radiation and one of the large black plastic bags where contaminated soil is stored .\nAs of 2022 , these remain ubiquitous in the prefecture .\nAs one ascends the ramp to the second floor the wall features a series of photographs and text that provide a chronology from the safety agreement between the prefecture and TEPCO in 1969 , commencement of operations in 1971 to the 13 meter tsunami that struck at 15:37 on 3.11 and the loss of AC power at 15:41 with a detailed timeline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day on March 12 , including bewildering and contradictory requests for evacuations within a 10 km radius of the plant at 5:44 AM on 3.12 and about 2 hours later a shelter in place order for a 10 km radius .\nThe next image shows Unit 1 after the hydrogen explosion at 15:36 PM later that day , a reissue of the evacuation order for those living within the 10 km radius at 17:39 PM , expanded to 20 km at 18:25 PM .\nOne can only imagine how local residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directives .\nThen on March 14 there was a second hydrogen explosion at Unit 3 followed by another early on the 15th at Unit 4 , a reactor that was not even in operation at the time .\nLater that morning a shelter in place order was issued for a 20-30 km radius from the reactors .\nThe chaotic government response to the unfolding compound disaster of earthquake , tsunami and major nuclear accident amplified the trauma , conveying uncertainty and incompetence at a time when the anxieties of affected people were already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origins and unfolding of the disaster in a more visceral and emotive set of displays than at the TEPCO Archive .\nThe combination of video , animation , photographs , dioramas , graphs and captions provides a thoughtful assessment of what happened , how lives were affected and what lessons can be gleaned to prepare for and mitigate future disasters .\nThe timeline of the earthquake , tsunami and nuclear accident shifts the focus to the broader impact and draws on documents , investigations and testimonies that add detail and credibility to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feelings of locals are conveyed powerfully , especially the ordeal of long-term displaced evacuees .\nAlthough not at the museum , readers interested in this subject can watch Funahashi Atsushi \u2019 s powerful documentary Nuclear Nation ( 2013 ) that follows a group of nuclear refugees from Futaba to an evacuation site in Saitama , detailing the demoralizing experience .\nVisitors learn about the power of rumors to distort reality and how these have been the basis for continued stigmatization affecting the lives of those engaged in agriculture and fisheries .\nTackling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter negative perceptions of Fukushima food products , and also present graphs showing increasing sales and prices .\nUnlike the TEPCO center , the museum provides a harsh assessment of the response to the nuclear accident as residents were given conflicting information and instructions , and relocated from evacuation centers several times , adding to the stress and trauma that still haunts the nuclear refugees .\nThere are touch screen panels that visitors can use to better understand what Fukushima \u2019 s residents have been dealing with in the aftermath of the meltdowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people who suddenly lost everything and have had to contend with dislocation , discrimination and anxieties about potential health problems , triggering PTSD and physical ailments .\nVisitors see the ultrasound machine used for thyroid examinations and replicas of other devices used in monitoring food safety .\nMother and child getting medical check .\nPhoto on display at the Greater East Japan Earthquake and Nuclear Disaster Memorial Museum .\n( Credit : Jeff Kingston ) The museum was opened in September 2020 and updated in March 2021 just before my first visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to criticisms from local residents and the media .\nThe enhanced exhibits modify information on four specific issues : 1 ) the use of the System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information ( SPEEDI ) ; 2 ) the botched evacuation of the Futaba Hospital and related deaths , 3 ) mandatory euthanasia of livestock , and ; 4 ) inadequate precautions and a poor emergency response due to radiation .\nThe updates were based on feedback from questionnaires filled out by visitors , opinions of prefectural residents and issues raised in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels , photos and display items were added .\n( Asahi 2021 ) A new panel mentions that government officials failed to utilize SPEEDI data for residents \u2019 evacuation , an oversight that relocated many evacuees to the hot zone of Iitate Village for an entire month , raising their radiation exposure and anxieties .\nThe Fukushima Prefectural Disaster Response Headquarters is accused of failing to make use of the data on radiation dispersion in any systematic way and of deleting 65 of the 86 emails it received with SPEEDI updates .\nHowever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of that sign there is an added explanation entitled : \u201c SPEEDI Not Usable in Evacuation \u201d , casting doubts on the usefulness of SPEEDI .\nElsewhere I met a retired prefectural official who was closely involved in the disaster response , and he too questioned how useful SPEEDI really is and said it was not possible to use the data to plan evacuations .\nThere is also added text about the problems of long-term evacuations , including isolation , loss of community , fears of \u201c dying alone \u201d in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restoring lives and livelihoods .\nAnother panel compares health surveys in 2014 and 2019-2020 indicating that radiation related health anxieties are abating .\nParents also seem less worried about letting children play outdoors ; in 2011 67 % were opposed to letting them play outside compared to 3 % in 2015 .\nHowever , the museum did add text about the failure of the central or prefectural governments to order the distribution of iodine tablets to lessen absorption of radiation , leaving it to local initiative .\nPerhaps the saddest addition refers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Futaba Hospital that caused the deaths of at least 40 patients during and after the ordeal due to delays and miscommunication .\n( Nakagawa 2021 ) Citing the 2012 Diet investigation report into the accident , there is a panel added in 2021 about , \u201c the collapse of the safety myth : a man-made calamity caused by failed measures.\n\u201d This safety myth was why evacuation drills had not been deemed necessary , ensuring a chaotic response when it was crucial to act effectively in a timely manner .\nTaking measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TEPCO archive avoids , the museum \u2019 s misery index also includes panels on \u201c living with anxiety everyday \u201d due to radiation concerns and restrictions on rice planting and the shipping of vegetables and the \u201c collapse of communities \u201d .\nAnother claims 2,329 disaster-related deaths as of September 30 , 2021 due to radiation impeding rescue efforts and delaying evacuations , and the negative health effects of evacuations and prolonged living in shelters .\nIn addition , there is a panel on the \u201c agonizing decision \u201d to accept the construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site .\nAgonizing because the prefecture was given little choice and because locals resent that they endured a nuclear disaster as a consequence of hosting a plant that only existed to generate electricity for Tokyo .\nNow Fukushima is left with ghost-towns , a battered economy and reputation in tatters .\nIt is now also saddled with TEPCO \u2019 s nuclear waste for at least two to three decades to come , if not longer , perhaps becoming the de facto radiation dump .\nAlso added in March 2021 is a replica of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Futaba \u2019 s main street , declaring \u201c Nuclear Power : Energy for a Bright Future \u201d .\nIt became a fixture of reporting on the nuclear accident , an ironic rebuke to the nuclear village of nuclear energy advocates .\nThe sign was removed from Futaba in 2016 partly because the pillars had rusted but also because it was an awkward reminder that seemed to mock TEPCO , the government and the townspeople who had naively embraced nuclear energy .\nIt now serves to remind visitors of how strong pro-nuclear sentiments were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind faith in TEPCO and official reassurances of 100 % safety , something unthinkable in contemporary Fukushima .\nOddly , the sign is displayed on an outdoor terrace at the rear of the museum , ostensibly because of its size , but staff acknowledge there are places inside or in front of the building where the sign would fit .\nWhatever the reason , placing this iconic symbol on a back terrace that is difficult to see from inside the museum is curious curation .\nThe mandatory evacuation order for Futaba was finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ghost-town bustling with construction projects .\nIn early April 2022 , next to the still deserted street where the iconic sign had been located is a small poster of an abandoned Futaba featuring Onuma Yuji , the student who came up with the winning catchphrase in praise of nuclear energy back in 1987 .\nIn the poster he is wearing a hazmat suit with his arms stretched upward holding a placard that blocks part of the original sign .\nThe placard declares Radioactive Ruins , featuring the symbol of radioactive flanked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indictment of the na\u00efve boosterism of his youth and the bright future based on nuclear energy that he and other townspeople had once believed in .\nNow , as depicted in the poster , the truncated iconic sign reads : \u201c Nuclear Power : Radioactive Ruins Future \u201d .\nSuperimposed on the image is a poem expressing Onuma \u2019 s anguish about the great betrayal , and what was lost .\nHe laments , \u201d Oh , if only there was no nuclear accident.\n\u201d Until 3.11 the sign had been a source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chernobyl accident was fresh in Onuma \u2019 s memory when he submitted his entry for the town competition in 1987 , he says that living in a small town of just under 8,000 where many residents were employed by TEPCO and related to someone who was , criticizing nuclear power was a taboo .\nBut after the reactor meltdowns he had a change of heart and in 2016 Onuma protested the removal of the pro-nuclear sign , wanting it to remain as a stark reminder of the misguided policy and wishful thinking that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may wonder if the crushed mini fire engine displayed next to the sign is a metaphor suggesting TEPCO \u2019 s inadequate disaster emergency preparedness or the government \u2019 s undersized safety countermeasures .\nThe bright red twisted heap was found in the vicinity of the museum and serves as a reminder of the heroic first responders who paid a heavy price in lives lost in the effort to rescue others along the tsunami-pulverized Tohoku coast .\nI was told that the Japanese Self Defense Forces offered one of their full-size fire engines that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent fuel pools during the Fukushima crisis .\nApparently under pressure from TEPCO , the museum declined to display this reminder of the nightmare that almost was .\nAs noted above , however , a display at the TEPCO Archive does show fire engines at work in the crisis response so it is not clear why it would oppose having one displayed at the museum .\nPerhaps the more critical context of the Museum shifts the fire engine from being a positive symbol of collective effort in managing the crisis to an indictment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and putting fire fighters lives at risk to save the nation from the utility \u2019 s lax safety culture .\nControversially , the media has reported that the local storytellers at the Memorial Museum who relate their experiences during and after the disaster are told , at the risk of losing their jobs , not to criticize TEPCO or the prefectural or central governments when talking to visitors .\n( Asahi 2020 ) A prefectural official told the Asahi , \u201c \u201c We believe it is not appropriate to criticize a third party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the Fukushima prefectural government in a public facility.\n\u201d Some of the guides are puzzled and angry at being muzzled since these organizations have been implicated in investigations into the nuclear disaster .\nGuides are asked to submit scripts of the remarks they intend to give that are reviewed and edited by museum staff .\nReportedly , any changes to the script , and media interviews , must be cleared with museum staff .\nFor example , if directly asked by a visitor about TEPCO \u2019 s responsibility for the accident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refer visitors to facility staff .\nThe Asahi points out that , \u201c Committees set up by the Diet and central government to investigate the cause of the Fukushima nuclear disaster issued reports that called it a \u201c man-made disaster \u201d and said TEPCO never considered the possibility that the Fukushima plant would lose all electric power sources in the event of an earthquake or tsunami because it stuck to a baseless myth that the plant was safe.\n\u201d ( Asahi 2020 ) In addition , there are displays at the museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so it is strange to prohibit guides from expressing opinions that are documented in the exhibits .\nI was unable to confirm this censorship in April 2022 but did chat at length with staff who were forthright in expressing critical opinions of TEPCO and government organizations .\nThe two museums present quite distinctive narratives of the nuclear crisis .\nVisitors inclined to support nuclear power will exit the TEPCO Decommissioning Archive Center feeling validated , but the exhibits are unlikely to persuade critics of TEPCO or skeptics about nuclear energy safety .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation of what happened inside Fukushima Daiichi during the first eleven days of the accident but does not probe into the institutionalized causes of the accident highlighted in the three main investigations .\n( Diet 2012 , Cabinet 2012 , RJIF 2012 ) There is acknowledgement that workers were not adequately trained to deal with the cascading disaster and expressions of remorse about the consequences without explicitly detailing the nature or extent of those consequences .\nThere is also considerable focus on decommissioning efforts but no examination of related controversies such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the next 30-40 years or local opposition to the building of a \u201c temporary \u201d nuclear waste storage facility .\nSimilarly , there is no acknowledgment of problems with the ALPS decontamination of radioactive water , or fishermen \u2019 s anger about the planned ocean discharge beginning in 2023 , the equivalent of some 500 Olympic-size pools worth of treated water now stored in over 1,000 water tanks at the plant site .\nThe Archive diverts attention away from such problems towards a more positive outlook .\nTEPCO has invested lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to improve its image and shape the 3.11 narrative .\nThis was never going to be easy , and challenges remain , but the Archive makes the best of a difficult situation and is what one would expect .\nIt \u2019 s one of the Fukushima tour sites , not far from the Museum and a new memorial at the Ukeda Elementary School that will attract visitors and as such an opportunity to provide different information , challenge damning narratives and influence public attitudes and memories .\nGiven how low TEPCO \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Archive can achieve PR goals of improving the corporate image and how its role in the disaster is remembered .\nAs of March 2022 , the Great East Japan Earthquake and Nuclear Disaster Memorial Museum has welcomed over 100,000 visitors since the museum opened in late 2020 but the pandemic has limited numbers that are only now beginning to recover .\nUnlike the Archive it is a stunning building in an expansive space that is more appealing for tourists and school excursions .\nIn addition to providing extensive coverage of the tsunami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear-related controversies that the Archive does not cover .\nAmong these are the botched evacuations , especially of elderly hospital patients , the frequent evacuations and lingering trauma of the nuclear refugees , the transformation of communities into ghost towns , the daily anxieties of living with radiation , and the disaster-related deaths of over 2,300 residents .\nOverall , the displays convey a damning indictment of TEPCO and government institutions and as such will powerfully influence collective memories of the traumas experienced and perceptions of the organizations responsible for the man-made nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities in Fukushima while etching its place in global memory alongside Chernobyl .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on Instagram

redefining \u201c the security challenges facing the Alliance and outline the political and military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address them.\n\u201d The NATO and the European Union are in unison that the world has fundamentally changed in the past decade and strategic competition is rising , and security threats in Europe and Asia are now so deeply connected that the two continents become a \u201c single operating system \u201d .\nThe past week saw some \u201c finishing touches \u201d to the new cold war agenda \u2014 the US President Joe Biden hosting Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand ; three tiny NATO countries in the Balkans blocking their air space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit Serbia ; and , Japan hosting the NATO Military Committee chief Rob Bauer .\nThe first one was about Washington stepping in to draw New Zealand , the reluctant Pacific partner standing in the shade , towards the Indo-Pacific centre stage .\n( Biden actually invoked memories of the landing of US troops in World War II in New Zealand . )\nThe second was an unprecedented act of diplomatic taboo , like dogs marking territory \u2014 \u201c Serbia belongs to the West.\n\u201d And Japan and NATO have messaged a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the US \u2019 struggle with China and Russia , Japan is emerging as the anchor sheet of its strategy in Asia .\nAn agreement was reached in Tokyo on Tuesday during Bauer \u2019 s visit that Japan and NATO will step up military cooperation and joint exercises .\n( In May , Japanese Military Chief of Staff Koji Yamazaki had joined a meeting of NATO counterparts in Belgium for the first time . )\nThe Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said after meeting with Bauer that Japan welcomed NATO \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said , \u201c The security of Europe and Asia are closely intertwined , especially now with the international community facing serious challenges.\n\u201d Bauer also spoke of \u201c shared security challenges \u201d for the NATO and Japan .\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida has been invited to the NATO summit in Madrid , which would make him the first Japanese leader to do so .\nJapan \u2019 s case is that Russia \u2019 s special operation in Ukraine distracts the US , which may embolden China to unify Taiwan with military force .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration does not seem to share Japan \u2019 s paranoia .\nThe defence ministers of the US and China are slated to meet in Singapore on the sidelines of the annual Shangri-La conference .\nThe US defence secretary Lloyd Austin has expressed cautious optimism that his forthcoming meeting will contribute to regional stability .\nReportedly , the US State Department changed its Fact Sheet over Taiwan this week , reinserting a line \u201c We do not support Taiwan independence , \u201d which had been removed a month earlier .\nJapan \u2019 s eagerness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in the West \u2019 s struggle with Russia stems from a complex set of motives .\nThe alacrity with which Japan became one of the most active countries in implementing strong sanctions against Russia in support of Ukraine is striking .\nAlmost overnight , Prime Minister Kishida swung to an openly negative stance towards Russia .\nWithin a fortnight of the Russian operation in Ukraine on February 24 , Kishida stated that the \u201c Northern Territories ( Kuril Islands ) are inherent territories of Japan \u201d and on 8th March , Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are \u201c unlawfully occupied by Russia.\n\u201d On 9th March , Kishida already referred Russia to the International Criminal Court .\nAnd on 16th March , Japan revoked Russia \u2019 s status as a \u201c most-favoured trading nation \u201d , froze Russian assets and excluded selected Russian banks from the SWIFT bank messaging system .\nSince the end of World War II , Japan had not sent military mat\u00e9riel to another country in the midst of fighting a war , but in in early March , the country \u2019 s Self-Defense Forces loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials bound for the battlefields of Ukraine .\nIn sum , Japan eagerly demonstrated its willingness to become a proactive partner in the US\u2013Japanese alliance .\nJapan discarded the equity painstakingly garnered through the past four decades of negotiations to settle the territorial issue and negotiate a post-World War II peace treaty with Russia .\nIn effect , Japan\u2013Russia relationship has been turned into a potential flashpoint in Northeast Asia .\nThe US-Japan mutual apprehension over the economic and military rise of China and North Korea \u2019 s increasingly capable missile and nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Washington and Tokyo , who no longer regard a split between Russia and China , as happened in the 1970s , to be a plausible near-term prospect .\nBut , fundamentally , there is a shift in Japanese foreign policy .\nJapan \u2019 s alliance with the US and the emergent coupling with the NATO go far beyond a focus merely on the country \u2019 s survival , but offers vistas for Japan to transform as a leader in the Indo-Pacific region .\nNo doubt , the understanding with the US on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-standing dispute over Kuril has emboldened Japan .\nSuffice to say , the Ukraine crisis has revealed that Asian states have much more diverse interests than many had been prepared to recognise .\nNow , this would act as a breaking mechanism on the path of the new cold war proponents in Asia .\nWhile the US , Australia and Japan have been at the forefront of countries opposing Russia , others have more mixed views .\nA large bloc of non-aligned countries in Asia , including India and Indonesia , insist that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notwithstanding its fallouts exacerbating global energy and food supplies .\nBasically , the vision of the Asian countries is of regional integration and modernisation and only a handful agreed to impose sanctions against Russia , while several \u2014 indeed , the big majority \u2014 have either openly opposed the sanctions regime or have refrained from sanctioning Russia .\nThe point is , Russia is a resident power in Asia and is a member of all the key bodies that constitute the region \u2019 s multilateral architecture \u2014 APEC , ASEAN Regional Forum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summit , etc.\n, apart from being a Dialogue Partner of the ASEAN since 1996 .\nRussia has had an uneven engagement with Asia \u2019 s institutions , but most of the region \u2019 s participants prioritise their relations with Moscow .\nUnless Russia were to reduce its presence voluntarily , which is inconceivable , Asia \u2019 s multilateral architecture remains a hurdle for the US \u2019 efforts to assemble a \u201c coalition of democracies \u201d to isolate Russia .\nThe Achilles heel of the US \u2019 cold war strategy is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden administration dare not contemplate a return to free trade , given the entrenched protectionist sentiments in the domestic politics .\nEven the tariff waivers issued by the Biden Administration on Monday on some solar panels for a 2-year period from four ASEAN countries \u2014 Cambodia , Malaysia , Thailand and Vietnam \u2014 needed to be carefully couched as part of efforts to address \u201c the urgent crisis of a changing climate\u2026 to ensure the US has access to a sufficient supply of solar modules to meet electricity generation needs while domestic manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : US \u2019 cold war strategy is primarily in military terms , whereas , what impresses Asian countries is economic clout .\nMeanwhile , while many in the West tend to see China as firmly in Russia \u2019 s corner , the reality is more nuanced .\nChina has sought to position itself as neither critic nor supporter of Russia , which , arguably , in the given circumstances , favours Russia , and has shown no signs of shifting its position in the face of Western criticism .\nWithout doubt , China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThat said , will China \u2019 s current stance hold the duration of the war in Ukraine which some predict could spill over to next year ?\nThe Russian military operation has not proceeded as successfully as Moscow would have wanted or expected .\nYet , the military operation will not end without achieving the Russian objectives .\nAnd those objectives contain variables .\nOn balance , Beijing would weigh in what the US \u2019 international standing is going to be at the end of it all , which would , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s future position in the world .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on Instagram ,

British International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) has hosted the \u201c Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore since 2002 .\nIt is billed as \u201c Asia \u2019 s premier security summit , \u201d all while being almost entirely Western-centric in agenda and design .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ format was created , the first plenary meeting has always been centered around the US Secretary of Defense \u2013 the United States being a nation not even located in Asia .\nThis year was no exception , the West and its interests took center stage .\nOpening remarks by IISS Director-General and Chief Executive John Chipman centered around the conflict in Ukraine and the notion that \u201c it is essential for the West to prevail.\n\u201d Chipman also ensured that it was clear that the West prevailing in Ukraine is just one small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules-based order \u201d prevailing globally , including over the Indo-Pacific region .\nWhile the opening and keynote address was given by Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio , it might as well have been given by US President Joe Biden or another senior representative from Washington .\nPrime Minister Kishida \u2019 s \u201c vision \u201d was indistinguishable from that of the US State Department or the US Department of Defense \u2019 s , it consisted of various objectives for the region identical to American interests right down to the fact that nothing PM Kishida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan and instead would be pursued on Washington \u2019 s behalf at the Japanese public \u2019 s expense .\nThis includes Japan adopting NATO-standard defense spending , something clearly aimed at China , a fellow East Asian state with which Japan does a considerable and growing amount of trade .\nThis increased military spending will create opportunities for Washington to box Beijing in , but at the cost of Japanese-Chinese relations reaching their full potential as well as at the cost of regional stability .\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing novel .\nIt was a reiteration of decades of US policy in Asia , a policy of maintaining primacy over the region , its people , and its resources , all under the guise of upholding what is continuously refers to as the \u201c rules-based international order.\n\u201d Like Chipman , Secretary Austin placed Washington \u2019 s proxy war with Russia at the heart of the discussion \u2013 accusing Russia of violating Ukraine \u2019 s sovereignty .\nSecretary Austin made these comments without any apparent sense of irony considering the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syria , continues its military occupation of Iraq against the desires of Iraqi representatives , and has only just recently withdrawn from Afghanistan , a Central Asian country left in ruins after 2 decades of US occupation .\nWorse still , was the emphasis Secretary Austin placed on Taiwan , officially recognized by the US as part of China under the \u201c One China Policy , \u201d and with Secretary Austin himself clearly stating , \u201c we do not support Taiwan independence , \u201d but still placing it on Washington \u2019 s agenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c assisting Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defense capability , \u201d through the shipment of arms to Taiwan against the wishes of Beijing .\nThe United States condemning Russia for violating Ukraine \u2019 s sovereignty while blatantly violating China \u2019 s in regards to Taiwan is a continuation of American exceptionalism \u2013 the creation and adherence to rules when convenient , and the wholesale trampling of those rules when inconvenient .\nSecretary Austin made several other paradoxical claims , the most troubling being the US supposedly not desiring \u201c an Asian NATO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s intent to expand military exercises across the region to build up military cooperation and expand military interoperability \u2013 in other words \u2013 the pursuit of \u201c an Asian NATO \u201d in everything but official title and treaty .\nAt one point Secretary Austin would claim : Next year , our Coast Guard will also deploy a cutter to Southeast Asia and Oceania .\nThat will open up new opportunities for multinational crewing , training , and cooperation across the region .\nAnd it will be the first major US Coast Guard cutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US deploying its military thousands of miles from its own shores , and in this case , deploying the US Coast Guard on the opposite side of the planet from where America \u2019 s actual coasts exist , is done as a means of attempting to integrate regional military forces into a US-led military presence .\nIt is being done precisely to threaten , constrain , encroach upon , and contain China in Asia .\nThis is what China is responding to , and yet China \u2019 s reasonable reactions to US military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US as \u201c the People \u2019 s Republic of China adopting a more coercive and aggressive approach.\n\u201d And while Secretary Austin condemns Russia for its alleged violations of Ukrainian sovereignty while clearly threatening China \u2019 s sovereignty regarding the Taiwan question , the US is also infringing on the sovereignty of its supposed \u201c partners \u201d across Asia and especially so in Southeast Asia .\nIt does this because while Secretary Austin claims America \u2019 s Asian partners share Washington \u2019 s vision regarding the region , this is not entirely true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point \u2013 and that is the point at which US coercion and interference is minimal .\nThe notion of \u201c ASEAN centrality \u201d as defined by the US is Southeast Asia \u2019 s leading role in defining regional architecture .\nThis is so simply because the US refuses to recognize China \u2019 s natural leadership role in Asia as the region \u2019 s largest nation by geography , population , and economy .\nIt is also so because the United States feels that its influence over ASEAN is greater than any influence it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways its is similar to the way the US influences or in many ways outright controls the European Union versus Russia .\nAs part of this process the United States funds and directs political opposition groups throughout ASEAN \u2013 groups that are anti-China , pro-West and more specifically , pro-American and seek to seize power in their respective nations , sabotage ties with China and fall into a US-led regional front against China .\nAnd just as it is similar to what the United States has constructed in Europe versus Russia it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact on Asia as a whole .\nThe United States , through political interference across ASEAN , is blatantly violating the individual sovereignty of ASEAN member states as well as creating a destabilizing effect on Asia as a region .\nThe protests in Hong Kong , continued aspirations toward separatism in Taiwan , ongoing protests still taking place in Bangkok , Thailand , and persistent armed conflict in Myanmar are all the result of US political interference in Asia and Washington \u2019 s desire to disrupt the peaceful Chinese-led rise of Asia in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Europe \u2019 s historical primacy over the region instead .\nWhen Secretary Austin accused Beijing of \u201c adopting a more coercive and aggressive approach , \u201d he was actually projecting .\nWhile China will continue to assert itself against US encroachment , it will be the US , for a lack of a better alternative , who becomes increasingly aggressive in its political interference in the region , unable to compete with China in the material terms China increasingly excels at .\nIn the months and years to come , we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Asia economically , politically , and militarily , versus Washington \u2019 s attempts to

all of the rhetoric , the underlying reason for Indonesian President Joko Widodo \u2019 s venture into world diplomacy was more about trying to save the G20 summit in Bali next November and address a growing world food crisis than any overly-ambitious mission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt says a lot about Widodo that he would go to such lengths , but the summit has come to symbolize a major milestone in his presidency which he hopes will bring the added bonus of more foreign investment to an economy battered by the Covid-19 pandemic .\nWhile nothing of genuine substance came from his two back-to-back meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , pulling off a peace-making miracle was hardly on the cards as the war rages on into its fifth month .\nThe president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before now unless it pays economic dividends , but his efforts to salvage the G20 has seen Indonesia forced into playing a more constructive role on the world stage rather than acting as a mere bystander .\nWidodo may have been stung by a comment from legislator Effendi Simbolon , a member of his ruling Indonesian Democratic Party for Struggle ( PDI-P ) , who told him last April he should be more proactive and not simply act as an \u201c event organizer.\n\u201d Widodo renewed his invitation to Zelensky to attend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so remotely , and carried a message from the Ukrainian president to Putin , the contents of which were not disclosed .\nHis talks in Moscow mostly appeared to center around the invasion \u2019 s impact on energy and food prices , telling reporters that the new harvest in Ukraine would leave 77 million tonnes of wheat trapped in the embattled country \u2019 s storage facilities .\nIn that , Widodo may be able to claim at least some credit for helping push a United Nations-brokered effort to reopen a trade corridor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off by Russian navy vessels and Ukrainian defensive mines .\nAs Widodo flew to Moscow on June 30 , Russia claimed it had ended its occupation of strategic Zmiinyi ( Snake ) island as a gesture of goodwill , but Putin has told the UN he will only allow the safe passage of Ukrainian grain if the West lifts its sanctions .\nThat was described by one US official as \u201c extortion diplomacy \u201d and there was no immediate sign the withdrawal from Zmiinyi will lead directly to an agreement .\nUkrainian officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the island .\nCaptured by the Russians last February , the rocky outcrop guards the approaches to Odessa , Ukraine \u2019 s largest deep-sea port which normally handles 40 million tonnes of cargo a year , or 65 % of its trade .\nWidodo has a stake in freeing up wheat shipments .\nThe longer the war drags on , the greater the danger that a shortage of flour will compel local firms to raise the politically-sensitive price of instant noodles , a hugely popular Indonesian staple .\nImage on the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having inflationary ripple effects in Indonesia .\nImage : Twitter Widodo \u2019 s government has only recently faced protests over a war-related increase in the domestic price of palm oil , which led to a brief export ban on the commodity and the removal of trade minister Muhammad Lutfi in a June 16 Cabinet reshuffle .\nKremlin officials indicated the Moscow talks touched on the prospect of more Russian wheat exports to Indonesia , which last year amounted to only 2,955 tonnes , compared to the three million tonnes imported from Ukraine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortfall .\nRussia and Ukraine account for a third of the world \u2019 s wheat exports and Ukraine alone grows enough of the grain to feed 400 million people .\nBut Moscow \u2019 s blockade means Kiev can only move two million tonnes a month , 60 % less than usual .\nOfficials say a fifth of Ukraine \u2019 s grain elevators have either been damaged in the war or are now in Russian-occupied territory , while a backlog of 20 million tonnes of last season \u2019 s harvest remains trapped in storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter crop .\nAs an invited guest at the G7 summit in Germany \u2019 s Bavarian Alps , Widodo got a taste of what he might expect at the G20 \u2013 if it goes ahead \u2013 with US President Joe Biden and allied leaders focusing squarely on Ukraine and the impact of sanctions on Russia .\nThe Indonesian government has condemned the war , but in walking a fine diplomatic line it has refused to dissuade Putin from showing up for the Bali gathering , which in a worst-case scenario could lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group \u2019 s pro-Western members .\nAlthough Moscow was part of what was then the G8 when it was formed in 1997 , it was suspended indefinitely following the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and ultimately announced its permanent withdrawal three years later .\nThat is unlikely to happen with the G20 .\nWidodo feels the need to step carefully , not only because of Indonesia \u2019 s historic non-aligned status , but also because many conservative Muslims support Russia \u2013 a consequence of the West \u2019 s perceived hostile attitude towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jakarta \u2019 s initial response to the invasion , which avoided naming Russia as the invader and called on the parties to pursue a \u201c peaceful resolution through diplomacy , \u201d as if Ukraine was a willing participant in the war .\n\u201c A generous interpretation of the mission would define it as an exemplar of Indonesia \u2019 s cherished \u2018 independent and active foreign policy , \u2019 \u201d wrote retired diplomat David Engel , head of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute \u2019 s Indonesia program .\n\u201c Jakarta has never tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of this phrase from the moment Russian troops began their brutal rampage , \u201d he said , pointing to the visit to the two warring capitals as corresponding to the \u201c active \u201d part of the doctrine .\nMost analysts believe Putin will stay away from the summit and Zelensky has said he won \u2019 t attend if the war is still on .\nThat rules out any chance of face-to-face peace negotiations in Bali , particularly when the Russian president \u2019 s ultimate objectives are still unknown .\nAccording to news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mario Draghi during a meeting on the sidelines of the G7 that Putin would not be coming either .\nBut Moscow said a decision had still not been made .\nDiplomats are now more optimistic the summit will go ahead intact , with new Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese reversing predecessor Scott Morrison \u2019 s position and saying he will go to Bali without any conditions attached .\nOther G20 countries appear to have changed their stance as well , notably Germany , whose chancellor , Olaf Scholz , the host of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television : \u201c There is a common conviction \u2026 that we don \u2019 t want to torpedo the G20.\n\u201d The head of the 27-nation European Commission , Ursula von der Leyen , even went further , saying she did not rule out sitting down with Putin .\nIt was important , she said , \u201c to tell him to his face what we think of him.\n\u201d Widodo was positioned front and center in the official G7 photograph , standing between Scholz and Biden , who at one point hugged the Indonesian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw as recognition of his new world stature .\nFormer Australian ambassador to Jakarta John McCarthy says if Putin does make an appearance in Bali , it will take considerable skill on the part of the Indonesians to ensure the meeting stays on track and doesn \u2019 t collapse into acrimony .\nThat may be put to the test on July 7-8 when the G20 foreign ministers , apparently including Russia \u2019 s Sergey Lavrov , gather in Bali \u2019 s heavily-guarded Nusa Dua tourist haven to lay the groundwork for the 17th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerhouses .\nAn Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman says it is still not clear whether Lavrov will be able to attend , but If other G20 preparatory meetings are any guide , many of the ministers will simply walk out when his turn comes to speak .\nPutin \u2019 s flying visit to Turkmenistan on June 29 was his first overseas trip since the start of the war , but the prospect of walking into a near-empty room in Bali will not appeal to someone now widely labeled as a war criminal .\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping mall , which killed 18 people on the second day of the G7 meeting , is being seen as further evidence Moscow is deliberately targeting the civilian population in an effort to break its spirit .\nAside from his almost abnormal fear of catching Covid , there may be another important reason for Putin wanting to stay at home .\nAs economic sanctions begin to bite , he may fear that any extended absence could lead to a palace coup .\nAlthough he had little to show for his efforts at shuttle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the United Arab Emirates was aimed at extracting a renewed promise from President Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan to help finance the US $ 32 billion plan to move Indonesia \u2019 s capital from Jakarta to Kalimantan .\nMaritime Coordinating Minister Luhut Panjaitan flew from Jakarta to Abu Dhabi to prepare for the visit , seen as yet another indication of Widodo \u2019 s determination to get the ambitious project off the ground before his second term ends in 2024 .\nThe government has often claimed the UAE is ready to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be channeled through the Indonesia Sovereign Wealth Fund .\nIt would fill a financing hole left by the withdrawal of Japan \u2019 s Softbank earlier this year .\nMore than the G20 summit , the new capital , to be known as Nusantara , is a potentially key part of Widodo \u2019 s legacy-building , cementing his place in the history books and

\u2019 s then Pentecostal Prime Minister , Scott Morrison , drew upon a term that his predecessors had not .\nOn November 8 that year , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region would be taken to another level , launching a \u201c new chapter in relations with our Pacific family.\n\u201d In an address to Asialink prior to attending the G20 Leaders \u2019 Summit in Osaka , Morrison was again found talking about the Indo-Pacific , which \u201c embraces our Pacific family with whom we have special relationships and duties , our close neighbours , our major trading partners , our alliance partners and the world \u2019 s fastest growing economies.\n\u201d Such language had all the resonances of white European paternalism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would only ever advance with the aid , and management , of civilised powers .\nIt was a sentiment reflected in the views of British explorer and anthropologist William Winwood Reade , who opined in his 1872 work The Martyrdom of Man that , \u201c Children are ruled and schooled by force , and it is not an empty metaphor to say that savages are children.\n\u201d While he accepted slavery as \u201c happily extinct \u201d , he thought it wise for a European government \u201c to introduce compulsory labour among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy its land.\n\u201d The language of the family imputes the existence of stern , guiding parents and wayward , mischievous children who might dare show some disobedience .\nThe parents , in the \u201c Pacific family \u201d , are never assumed to be any of the Pacific Island states , who are seen as merely squabbling siblings in need of control .\nMorrison \u2019 s coining of the expression had the benefit of unmasking a Freudian truth .\nPacific Island states had long been considered charity cases and laggards in development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian markets or security outposts .\nConcerns about climate change had barely been acknowledged .\nWhen needed , Australian police and military forces had also intervened to arrest any supposed sliding into instability .\nThe term became even more problematic in the wake of independent security decisions made by Pacific Island states with China .\nA central premise of the charity-child relationship between Canberra and its smaller neighbours has been of one compliant behaviour .\nWe give you money and largesse from the aid budget ; you stay loyal and consistent to Australian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror , was the Solomon Islands-China security pact which had , on the face of it , the potential to facilitate the establishment of a Chinese military base .\nIn his April visit to Honiara , Senator Zed Seselja , Australia \u2019 s Minister for International Development , proved unsparing in reiterating the familial script .\nHe told the Solomons Island Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare that , \u201c the Pacific family \u201d would \u201c always meet the security needs of our region.\n\u201d He would be wise to \u201c consult the Pacific family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparency , consistent with our region \u2019 s security frameworks.\n\u201d The concern from Australian security wonks at Honiara \u2019 s willingness to go so far with Beijing caused an outburst of neo-imperial candour .\nThe parent should take full control of the situation and initiate an abusive , punitive invasion , ostensibly in the name of protecting the sovereignty of another state .\nA rattled Solomon Islands Prime Minister rebuked such views in parliament , claiming that \u201c we are treated as kindergarten students walking around with Colt .45s in our hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Australia \u2019 s then opposition Labor Party , vying for government in the May elections , quickly fell in with the language , extending it and bending it to suit .\nIn fact , it went so far as to scold the Coalition government for sending a junior minister to the Solomon Islands to argue against Honiara \u2019 s signing of a security pact with Beijing .\nInstead of sending Seselja , Labor campaign spokesman Jason Clare argued , Foreign Minister Marise Payne should have been on that plane .\n\u201c What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a business function and some bloke called Zed got sent there.\n\u201d Then savages were simply not wooed .\nBuilding on the theme of coaxing and pressuring Pacific neighbours to do the right thing by Australia \u2019 s security interests , Clare insisted on a more aggressive pose .\n\u201c You can \u2019 t sit back on the deck chair in the Pacific and just assume that everything \u2019 s going to be okay.\n\u201d The dark children , in other words , might play up .\nThe new Labor government of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paternal condescension , letting Pacific Island states know that Canberra was keeping watch on any errant behaviour while still claiming to respect them .\nJust prior to visiting Samoa and Tonga in early June , Foreign Minister Penny Wong boasted of embarking on her second visit to the Pacific since assuming her cabinet post .\n\u201c We want to make a uniquely Australian contribution to help build a stronger Pacific family \u2013 through social and economic opportunities including pandemic recovery , health development and infrastructure support , as well as through our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific states were also assured that parent Australia had heard their concerns about climate change in a way that the previous parent had not .\n\u201c We will stand shoulder to shoulder with our Pacific family in addressing the existential threat of climate change.\n\u201d The persistent use of the term \u201c Pacific family \u201d has not gone unnoticed among some Australian critics .\nJulie Hunt is unimpressed .\n\u201c If someone tries to inveigle themselves into our family , or continually tell us that we are part of their family , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a bit presumptuous ?\n\u201d The utterance of such familial terminology brought with it a range of unpleasant neo-colonial connotations .\nFor Hunt , the term would remain meaningless till \u201c we show by our actions that we understand their perspectives and respect them .\nDare I suggest that we wait until they return the feelings , and wait until they call us family ?\n\u201d And a long wait that may prove to be .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free to repost and share widely Global Research

if governments and societies do not take action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear weapons obsolete and to prevent further climate change \u201d .\nSummarized below is how after a mere 6 weeks in office the Australian Albanese Labor Government is already abjectly failing on the key existential threats to Humanity and the Biosphere of ( 1 ) nuclear weapons , ( 2 ) poverty , and ( 3 ) climate change .\n( i ) Under Labor Australia blindly backs US nuclear terrorism through key communications bases crucial for US nuclear strategy ( Pine Gap and Harold Holt ) , helping encircle China , hosting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear-armed warships .\n( ii ) Labor ignores continuing UK nuclear contamination of Australia ( notably at Maralinga ) that threatens both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians .\n( iii ) Labor supports anti-China Australian alliances with nuclear powers , namely the Australia-UK-US ( AUKUS ) Alliance and the Quad ( Australian US , India and Japan ) .\n( iv ) The circa $ 200 billion Labor-supported Australia-UK-US ( AUKUS ) nuclear submarines deal locks Australia in with US militarism , threatens an arms , risks nuclear proliferation , and will subject millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v ) The US lackey Australian Labor Government strongly backs US hostility to peaceful but nuclear-armed China .\nChina is Australia \u2019 s biggest trading partner , but the Coalition Government insulted China in 14 areas , and Chinese investment has slumped .\nDespite China overtures , the new Labor Government is following the counterproductive and insulting \u201c megaphone diplomacy \u201d of its predecessor .\nIgnoring border spats with India , Russia and Vietnam , China has invaded and occupied only 2 countries in the last millennium ( Tibet in the 12th century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn contrast , as UK or US lackeys , Australians have invaded 85 countries in 234 years ( 30 of the invasions being genocidal ) , and in the last 80 years Australians have violated all Indo-Pacific countries variously through war , climate criminality , subversion , and covert US-backed regime change in Indonesia ( 1960-1965 ) , Laos ( 1960 ) , Cambodia ( 1970 ) , Chile ( 1973 ) , Australia ( 1975 , 2010 ) and Fiji ( 1987 , 2000 ) .\n( vi ) Australia is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting nuclear terrorist and serial war criminal Apartheid Israel that has 90 nuclear weapons with submarine-based and other missile delivery systems .\nApartheid Israel has invaded the territory of 13 countries , has annexed the territory of 4 countries , and routinely bombs Syria , Iraq and the Gaza Concentration Camp .\nThe WW1 onwards Palestinian Genocide has been associated with 2.2 million Palestinians deaths from violence , 0.1 million , and deprivation , 2.1 million .\nOf 15 million Palestinians , 8 million are Exiled from Palestine , 5.2 million Occupied Palestinians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can not vote for the government ruling them ( apartheid ) , and about 2 million Israeli Palestinians can vote , albeit as Third Class citizens under 65 race-based discriminatory laws .\nDespite a century of genocide , 7.2 million Indigenous Palestinians represent 50 % of the Subjects of Apartheid Israel ( Jewish Israeli 47 % ) .\nPro-Apartheid Israel and hence pro-apartheid Labor supports the all-European , anti-Arab anti-Semitic , anti-Jewish-anti-Semitic and holocaust-denying International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance ( IHRA ) of which Australia is a member , and which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n( vii ) Australia \u2019 s alliance with nuclear terrorist America makes Australia a prime nuclear target .\nIf the US uses nuclear weapons against another country , any nuclear response on Americans would likely precipitate all-out nuclear war ( and the end of Humanity and the Biosphere ) .\nHowever a graded nuclear response would target Australia .\n( viii ) Labor has yet to sign and ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons ( TPNW ) .\nHowever US lackey Australia would violate the TPNW by continuing intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is therefore unlikely that the US lackey Australian Labor Government will sign and ratify the TNMW .\n( i ) Australia has an obscene role in the Global Avoidable Mortality Holocaust ( 7.4 million deaths from poverty annually ) through low development aid \u2013 0.22 % of GNI compared to 1.05 % ( Luxembourg ) , 1.02 % ( Norway ) , and 0.99 % ( Sweden ) .\n( ii ) Serial war criminal Australia \u2019 s defence spending will be 15 times greater than development aid by 2030 .\nFourth Geneva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US Asian wars that resulted in 40 million Asian deaths from violence and deprivation .\n( iii ) Labor will tolerate massive domestic poverty \u2013 over 3 million people , including 1 million children , live in poverty in rich Australia in which the property-owning rich are getting vastly richer and the excluded poor ( including the working poor ) are getting poorer .\n( iv ) Labor will ignore huge preventable deaths in Australia \u2013 preventive measure inadequacies mean that 85,000 Australians die preventably each year due to \u201c lifestyle choice \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from adverse hospital events and smoking to suicide and homicide .\n( i ) Climate criminal Australia is among the worst in the world for climate policy and climate action ( in 2022 it ranked worst for climate policy ) .\n( ii ) Australia has 0.3 % of world \u2019 s population but is responsible for 5.4 % of global greenhouse gas pollution ( including Exported as well as Domestic pollution ) .\n( iii ) Under Labor 114 new coal and gas projects will start , but science , the International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greens demand no new fossil fuel projects for a global \u201c net zero carbon pollution by 2050 \u201d .\n( iv ) Labor pledges only 43 % off 2005 greenhouse gas pollution by 2030 and the Coalition 26-28 % , but the Greens demand \u201c net zero or net negative Australian greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 or sooner \u201d .\n( v ) Like the Coalition Labor rejects any true costing of pollution via a Carbon Tax based on a Carbon Price ( $ 200 per tonne CO2-equivalent but a global applied average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nThe World has an inescapable Carbon Debt in USD of $ 200-250 trillion that is increasing at $ 16 trillion per year , and Australia has a Carbon Debt of $ 5 trillion that is increasing at $ 400 billion per year and at $ 40,000 per head per year for under-30 year old Australians .\n( vi ) Australia is committed to continue leading the world in coal and gas exports , and is among world leaders in 16 areas of climate

Anglo-Australian legal system has much to answer for .\nWhile robed lawyers and solemn justices proclaim an adherence to the rule of law , the rule remains a creature in state , more fetish than reality .\nHad the farcical prosecution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , all suspicions about a legal system slanted in favour of the national security state would have been answered .\nCollaery , a sagacious and well-practiced legal figure , has been the subject of interest under section 39 of the Australian Intelligence Services Act 2001 ( Cth ) , which covers conspiracies to reveal classified information .\nIt all began when he was , in the natural order of things , consulted by former intelligence officer Witness K. Witness K has been convicted for revealing the existence of a 2004 spying operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ASIS ) that led to the bugging of cabinet offices used by the Timor-Leste government .\nThe operation was instigated at the behest of Australia \u2019 s corporate interests .\nAt the time , Canberra was involved in treaty negotiations with Timor-Leste on the subject of accessing oil and gas reserves .\nEast Timor \u2019 s crushing poverty and salivating need for hard cash did not interest Australia \u2019 s own resource companies and the desk bureaucrats in Australia \u2019 s capital .\nIn 2013 , both men lent their services to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court of Arbitration in the Hague .\nAustralia \u2019 s illegal operation was finally going to make it into international law proceedings , thereby invalidating the original agreement reached between Dili and Canberra .\nAlarm bells sounded and raids in Canberra made , though the nothing stirred the prosecutors till 2018 .\nWishing to stake his claim to protecting national security , Attorney General Christopher Porter , in contrast to his predecessor , thought it appropriate to commence legal proceedings against Collaery and Witness K. As matters proceeded , Porter \u2019 s fascination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident .\nAttempts were made to hold the trials in utter secrecy and out of the scrutinising mischief of the press .\nThe Attorney General also imposed a national security order that prevented the parties from divulging details of the prosecution to the public or press .\nWith Witness K \u2019 s conviction , Collaery was left standing to counter five charges alleging that he communicated information to various ABC journalists prepared by or on behalf of ASIS and allegedly conspired with Witness K to communicate that same information to the Government of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resemble those of a smug and doltish inquisition keen to draw out proceedings and fritter away accountability .\nThere were efforts made to restrict the accused from actually seeing the evidence that might be used against him in trial .\nThere were attempts to prevent the release of the full published reasons of the ACT appeals court , which found that various \u201c identified matters \u201d in the Commonwealth case against Collaery should be made available to the public .\nOpen justice can be such a nuisance .\nLawyers and observers covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barrister had descended into a charade .\nKieran Pender of the Human Rights Law Centre , attending the sessions with almost religious dedication , compared it a \u201c lottery \u2013 would I be permitted into court today , or would the secrecy shrouding the case win out ?\n\u201d With the election of the Albanese government , a change of approach was aired .\nAustralia \u2019 s new Attorney-General , Mark Dreyfus , decided to call an end to matters .\n\u201c I have had careful regard to our national security interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d he claimed in making the decision .\nThe \u201c decision to discontinue the prosecution was informed by the government \u2019 s commitment to protecting Australia \u2019 s national interest , including our national security and Australia \u2019 s relationships with our close neighbours.\n\u201d Dreyfus did all he could to suggest that this case was not a sign of future leniency to whistleblowers .\nIt was \u201c an exceptional case .\nGovernments must protect secrets and our government remains steadfast in our commitment to keep Australians safe by keeping secrets out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had protested against Collaery \u2019 s treatment expressed relief .\nRebekha Sharkie , in welcoming the decision , condemned the previous Attorney General for pursuing a \u201c politically-motivated prosecution \u201d which was \u201c an embarrassment to the rule of law in Australia.\n\u201d East Timorese notables long enchanted by the good grace of Collaery and Witness K were relieved by the decision .\nXanana Gusm\u00e3o , in a statement , commended the decision to discontinue the prosecution .\nCollaery had been \u201c prosecuted for alleged breaches of Australian national security laws by disclosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s cabinet room during oil and gas negotiations.\n\u201d Such bugging for commercial purposes had been \u201c illegal and unconscionable.\n\u201d The Dreyfus decision does not end the matter .\nProsecutions against whistleblowers in Australia , encouraged by weak and vague protections , remains current fare .\nThe whistleblower David McBride , who revealed the extent of alleged war crimes by Australian special forces in Afghanistan , still faces the prosecutor \u2019 s brief .\nAs does Richard Boyle , the Australian Tax Office whistleblower who revealed ill-doings at the tax office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be dropped .\nFor the sake of the rule of law , his arguments are hard to fault .\nBut the national security state clings and claws , preventing reforms .\nEven Dreyfus finds

\u2019 s efforts to preemptively \u201c thwart this tyrant \u201d .\nUS Secretary of State Blinken flipped reality on its head over the weekend by blaming Russia for Sri Lanka \u2019 s bankruptcy crisis .\nAccording to him , \u201c We \u2019 re seeing the impact of this Russian aggression playing out everywhere .\nIt may have contributed to the situation in Sri Lanka ; we \u2019 re concerned about the implications around the world.\n\u201d There \u2019 s no basis whatsoever to his claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propagandistic talking point that \u2019 s intended to smear Russia \u2019 s regional reputation as it \u201c Returns to South Asia \u201d .\nThis process is geo-economically driven and led by the energy assistance that Moscow \u2019 s extended to its partners in this part of the world , especially geostrategically positioned Sri Lanka .\nFar from being responsible for that country \u2019 s crisis , which the author explained last week is actually attributable to a confluence of policymaking mistakes , Russia was recently asked by the Sri Lankan authorities to scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been providing to alleviate it .\nThis is proven by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe asking for that to happen earlier this month in an exclusive interview that he gave to TASS .\nIt \u2019 s unbelievable that he \u2019 d have done this if he felt that Moscow was responsible for the mess that Sri Lanka \u2019 s found itself in over the past few months .\nTo the contrary , its premier appreciates the support that Russia \u2019 s since extended to it and is eager for the Kremlin to do more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet he \u2019 s shamelessly lying through his teeth for reasons that will now be explained .\nThere \u2019 s no way that he expects anyone in South Asia to listen to what he said since everyone is aware that it \u2019 s nothing but a blatant falsehood , which suggests that his targeted audience is actually the Western one .\nWithout reliable access to Russian media due to its flagships either being officially censored there or put under such state pressure that they could no longer properly operate , most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive their information from the US-led Mainstream Media ( MSM ) .\nEverything that they \u2019 ve been told thus far is that Russia is supposedly holding the entire Global South hostage by depriving it of much-needed fertilizer and food .\nIt should be mentioned that these same developing countries don \u2019 t believe that one bit and are aware of the artificially manufactured origins of this crisis , yet most Westerners don \u2019 t doubt that weaponized information warfare narrative for a second .\nIn their mind , President Putin is either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madman \u201d who simply wants to kill as many people as possible just for the fun of it , especially non-Caucasians , since they \u2019 ve been indoctrinated into ridiculously imagining that he \u2019 s the reincarnation of Hitler .\nThe only reason why the Secretary of State would say something as bonkers as President Putin being responsible for Sri Lanka \u2019 s crisis when that second-mentioned country \u2019 s Prime Minister and even its recently resigned President both publicly requested Russia to scale up its support for their people is because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .\nThis is all part of the US \u2019 unprecedented propaganda campaign against that Eurasian Great Power , which in this context is intended to convince Westerners to back whatever means their governments say are required in order to \u201c stop Russia and save the world.\n\u201d By pointing to dramatic footage of recent events in Sri Lanka and telling everyone that President Putin was personally responsible for provoking chaos in a far-away land , Blinken is scaremongering by getting Westerners to fear that their country might be the next to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they support all of their government \u2019 s efforts to preemptively \u201c thwart this tyrant \u201d .\nThis isn \u2019 t just limited to restricting more civil liberties at home or plotting a provocative naval operation in the Black Sea under the false pretext of \u201c protecting Ukrainian grain exports \u201d , but can also be extended to further pressuring those South Asian states like India that continue closely cooperating with Russia .\nIn sum , Blinken blatantly lied about Russia \u2019 s alleged culpability in Sri Lanka \u2019 s bankruptcy crisis in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in South Asia who knows better than to believe this easily debunked falsehood .\nIt \u2019 s an insult to everyone \u2019 s intellect that he \u2019 d say something that \u2019 s so obviously unbelievable , but that just goes to show how little he thinks about his own people \u2019 s intelligence that he didn \u2019 t even think that they \u2019 d google what he just claimed .\nThose that do so will learn that the Sri Lankan Prime Minister and President both publicly requested that Russia scale up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @

to nationalise Sakhalin-1 oil and gas development project by ousting US and Japanese shareholders .\nBut Moscow will make an exception for India so that OVL which holds 20 % stake will remain & continue to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue to hold controlling share , more Indian companies may be inducted to replace US & Japan and thereby also ensure a sales market in India .\nThe Sakhalin-1 is located off the coast of Sakhalin Island in the Russian Far East .\nIt comprises three offshore fields \u2014 namely , Chayvo , Odoptu , and Arkutun-Dagi .\nUntil recently , the Sakhalin-1 project was operated by a Russian subsidiary of the American major ExxonMobil known as Exxon Neftegaz , which owns 30 % of the shares .\nIn addition , 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 30 % by the Japanese company Sodeco , and 20 % by the Indian ONGC Videsh .\nWhereas Sakhalin-2 specialises in the export of liquefied natural gas , Sakhalin-1 is in the export of Sokol oil .\nThe capacity of Sakhalin-1 is quite impressive .\nThere was a time before OPEC+ set limits on production level , when Russia extracted as much as 400,000 barrels per day , but the recent production level has been about 220,000 barrels per day .\nThe abrupt departure of the Americans following the US sanctions against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to just 10,000 barrels .\nRussians hope that with the replacement by more Indian companies , the production level can be restored to the previous level .\nIndeed , the hope is that Indian ONGC Videsh will pull up the production level of Sakhalin-1 project relatively quickly by bringing in own technologies .\nThe overall trend of nationalising the holdings of American , British , Japanese and European capital in Russia \u2019 s strategic sectors of economy is crystallising as the new policy \u2014 the Russian version of India \u2019 s AatmaNirbhar Bharat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The cleansing of Russian economy , freed of Western capital , is expected to accelerate in the period ahead .\nIndia has seamless opportunities here to make investments and reap windfall profits .\nIn strategic terms , India \u2019 s energy security will also be guaranteed for decades to come .\nMoscow was well aware of the predatory character of Western capital in Russia \u2019 s oil sector \u2014 a legacy of the Boris Yeltsin era \u2014 but had to live with the exploitation as it didn \u2019 t want to antagonise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is history now .\nThe souring of relations with the West to almost breaking point rids Moscow of such archaic inhibitions .\nIndeed , the new policy to replace western capital from the commanding heights of Russian economy is not without risks , but Moscow is confident that it is on the right track and must do what it takes .\nAlso , the decrease in production in the Sakhalin-1 , unless addressed soon , may negatively affect the very characteristics of the oil fields in the Russian Far East , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of oil is left to remain in the reservoirs .\nThe development of the fields had depended on Western equipment and technologies .\nNow Russia has lost both .\nOn the other hand , the departure of the Americans will leave Russia with no easy route but to have its own technologies .\nOn balance , however , Americans stand to lose heavily too , as the production sharing arrangements dating back to the Yeltsin era had been forced out of Russian government when it was in dire economic straits during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in no position to negotiate optimal deals .\nCome to think of it , something like 262 such so-called production sharing agreements ( PSAs ) were squeezed out of the Russian government by western oil companies by the time Yeltsin retired .\nAfter coming to power in 1999 , President Vladimir Putin set about the mammoth task of cleaning up the Aegean stables of Russia \u2019 s foreign collaboration in the oil sector .\nThe \u201c decolonisation \u201d process was excruciatingly difficult , but Putin pulled it through and got rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 262 ) PSAs .\nIn fact , Sakhalin-1 and Sakhalin-2 are the very last remaining two PSAs harking back to post-Soviet Russia \u2019 s decade of humiliation under Yeltsin .\nAny surprises why the Biden Administration hates Putin so much and wants him out of power in Moscow ?\nLegend is that when the Soviet Communist Party Secretary Nikita Khrushchev paid his pathbreaking visit to India in 1955 , then Prime Minister Nehru , amongst other \u201c talking points \u201d , referred to Soviet Union \u2019 s great reservoir of expertise in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West

Moscow , deputed a famous Soviet expert / geologist to India to prospect for oil \u2014 whose fame was such that he could apparently smell oil lying untapped deep in the bowels of the earth !\nThus was born the ONGC in 1956 , which is now heading for Sakhalin Island on a similar mission !\nNote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttons above or below .\nFollow us on Instagram and Twitter and subscribe to our

.\nWhile the current energy and food crisis contributed greatly to Sri Lanka \u2019 s economic collapse , it must be emphasized that the COVID-19 pandemic has already crippled the global economy , resulting in the impoverishment of people worldwide .\nThe people \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last three months achieved its main objective on July 9 with President Nandasena Gotabhaya Rajapakse \u2019 s offer to resign .\nOn this historic day , about 100,000 people gathered in Colombo in a mass mobilisation .\nThey engaged in non-violent direct action against a heavily-armed military and police force and occupied Rajapakse \u2019 s office , his official residence , as well as Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe \u2019 s official residence .\nThis was an organised expression of popular frustration and anger , due to electricity cuts , fuel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of essential consumer goods .\nThe night before the main mobilisation , police enforced a curfew on Colombo and surrounding districts .\nThe Bar Association of Sri Lanka immediately issued a statement claiming the curfew was \u201c blatantly illegal and a violation of the fundamental rights of the people \u201d .\nOn the morning of the mobilisation , the station masters were ordered by the defence department \u2014 which sits under the president \u2014 to suspend train services .\nThe railway unions , including the Station Masters \u2019 Union opposed the suspension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , when crowds of protesters agitated at the stations , the station masters agreed to resume services .\nMany people couldn \u2019 t travel to Colombo because of fuel shortages , which have paralysed public buses as well as rail transport .\nSome people held protests in their own towns .\nMany walked from different parts of the country and some used bicycles .\nSome started their journey the previous day from their towns .\nThere were numerous walking caravans and rallies organised in the days leading up to the July 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of citizens emphasising diversity and solidarity , without the intervention of any political parties , and built by a range of dispersed protests that began nearly three months ago .\nThe movement emerged in early March with people engaging in non-violent silent protests , holding placards and candles in the evening , as electricity cuts and other shortages were affecting their daily lives .\nIn late March , a collective of activists occupied a struggle zone , known as the Gota Go Gama ( Gota Go Village , GGG ) in Galle Face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office in the commercial and public administrative centre of Colombo .\nThis followed a peaceful protest in front of the president \u2019 s private residence , during which the police used tear gas and water cannons , escalating the struggle .\nThe activists at GGG articulated the struggle as a non-violent , peaceful protest , independent of political parties .\nAmong the activists were citizen journalists , social media activists , artists , students , religious leaders , lawyers , civil society activists and labour activists .\nThese activists also overlapped with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights activists .\nSome activists were informed by the Arab Spring struggles against authoritarian regimes , global anti-austerity struggles since 2010 , and the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement .\nThe concept of the GGG soon spread to other urban centres , mainly around Colombo , and the Western Province , the most densely populated part of the island .\nThese were generally led by local youth protesting in a town , in some cases with permanent tents as a gathering point , with loose coordination with other GGGs .\nThe activists \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused of war crimes , assassinations of dissenters , theft and waste of public funds and fomenting patriarchal Sinhala Buddhist nationalism .\nElected in 2019 , Rajapakse \u2019 s three brothers and nephew joined him in the government formed after the 2020 parliamentary elections .\nFollowing the 2019 Easter Sunday Bombing , his promise to strengthen national security was a key strategy to gain political power .\nA former military officer , Rajapakse was also considered a \u201c war hero \u201d and commanded the respect and authority of his supporters .\nHowever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authoritarian kleptocrat has endured a humiliating defeat by an organised popular peaceful protest movement .\nRajapakse was the target because he represents a regime that has undermined access to basic goods and remained insensitive to the suffering of the masses .\nHis regime represents an authoritarian patrimonial culture engaged in state capture , where private firms gain access to profit-making activities sold by public officials and politicians .\nWith the pretence of representing the people , the regime fostered a patron-client culture that used public resources to gain the loyalty of bureaucrats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , social media users and civil society actors , as well as voters .\nAfter coming to power , Rajapakse passed a constitutional amendment ( the 20th amendment ) in October , 2020 .\nThis enabled him to appoint his allies in the military and business community into public institutions .\nHe also reorganised a range of public institutions , bringing them under his authority .\nRather than direct privatisation , commercial activities were established within public services , including the military , with opportunities to profit from commissions .\nThe president \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of the subject or field , were appointed to positions of power .\nAlthough the regime was promoted as a system based on knowledge and professionalism , the regime directly undermined professions and the integrity of the public sector by restricting any dissent .\nIt was strengthened through chauvinist Sinhala Buddhist ethno-nationalist tendencies that marginalised other ethnic and religious communities .\nRajapakse was a product of an authoritarian Sinhala-Buddhist military institutional setting .\nHe joined the army in 1971 , at the time of a youth insurrection .\nIt was in response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth agitations in the North in the mid-1970s that the anti-democratic Prevention of Terrorism Act was introduced in 1979 .\nNearly 35 years later \u2014 from 2005 to 2015 , under the presidency of his elder brother , Mahinda \u2014 Rajapakse headed the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development .\nIn 2009 , he was involved in the military offensive that ended the anti-Tamil war in a blood bath , massacring 40,000\u201370,000 innocent Tamil civilians .\nRajapakse is directly accused of a range of crimes , including the assassination and disappearance of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe images of the journalists , who were killed under Mahinda \u2019 s regime , are displayed in large posters at the GGG .\nWickrematunge \u2019 s assassination is directly related to his reporting on a defence contract for fighter jets that involved the misappropriation of public funds for personal gain by Rajapakse .\nThe GGG activists maintained their non-violence strategy despite a range of violent and subversive strategies used by the regime .\nThese included police shooting people protesting delayed petrol deliveries and fuel price hikes in April , which left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police also arrested a range of activists in late May , claiming they were involved in retaliatory attacks on the private residences of parliamentarians , following the attack on the GGG on May 9 by supporters of the regime .\nThere were also arrests of key activists in June , on false allegations of damaging public property during protests .\nFrom the inception of the GGG , the mainstream media , as well as social media , sided with the regime , devaluing and belittling the protests as an apolitical carnival .\nSome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot by foreign actors to create unrest .\nThere were dissenting views among the GGG activists , with some \u2014 mostly driven by individual self-interest \u2014 encouraging alliances with political parties or entering into negotiations with the regime .\nThe GGG activists were also committed to a democratic culture that avoided hierarchies .\nThis horizontality enabled a broader participation with transparency and accountability .\nThe GGG received support from a range of people within and outside the country .\nThe GGG was also openly critical of those who tried to commercialise the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a People \u2019 s Library , a People \u2019 s Cinema and conducted discussions on a range of issues .\nAttendance at these events varied , with crowds often dwindling towards the end of June .\nNevertheless , the activism remained lively with discussions over strategy and how to enable more protests actions , especially in rural towns .\nThe GGG decided in early July to escalate the protest movement with a broad mobilisation into Colombo .\nThe trade union movement , student movement and civil society organisations , along with Frontline Socialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna ( Peoples Liberation Front , JVP ) , began engaging in a range of protest actions while promoting the mass mobilisation on July 9 .\nThey were also vocal about the regime \u2019 s attempts to infiltrate and create violence in order to delegitimise the movement .\nMeanwhile , artists and social media activists engaged in maintaining momentum through Facebook , blogs and YouTube videos .\nTheir interventions also created new cultural identities , as active citizens encouraging new democratic practices .\nA key part of the GGG non-violent activism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces , mainly police and the army , in non-confrontational ways , emphasising shared interests .\nThe protesters kept reminding the frontline security personnel that they were not the target of the protests and that the people they were protecting had stolen from the people and plunged them into collective suffering .\nThey also reminded the security forces that those at the top would abandon them to take the fall , if they faced legal charges \u2014 an enduring trend to protect and preserve the ruling regime .\nDespite tear gas and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from retaliating with rocks and stones , which is the usual reaction .\nProtesters committed to a non-violent creative language used to spread the word and contain others who were getting ready for violent reactions .\nThere were numerous instances when the police and the military personnel in the frontlines did their duty without provoking protesters and the people recognised and applauded these actions .\nAt the barricades , protesters continued to engage with the security personnel even when they were being attacked with tear gas and water cannons .\nAt times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military and police who had been affected by tear gas .\nThis dynamic between the security forces and the protesters was possible because of the commitment to non-violence that was reiterated through multiple modes of communication .\nThey openly communicated , avoiding any property damage , since the target was reclaiming public property .\nContaining an escalation of violence was also possible , because the shortages were affecting the lives of security workers , too .\nTheir relatives , like others , were in queues for days .\nThis enabled some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people , particularly when the regime was incapable of doing so .\nMore than 100 people were critically injured in the protests and occupations and more than 40 are still in hospital .\nOthers suffered multiple minor injuries .\nTear gas and water cannons were used against the protesters many times .\nAt the president \u2019 s residence , live ammunition was fired towards the crowd as well as into the air .\nThe protesters would disperse , but then regroup after a few minutes .\nThey kept demanding the security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied the presidential secretariate , the president \u2019 s official residence \u2014 located next to the GGG \u2014 and the PM \u2019 s official residence nearby .\nJust who was responsible for setting fire to parts of the PM \u2019 s private residence remains a mystery , although it is blamed on the protesters .\nThis incident happened later in the evening , after dark .\nThe security forces had beaten up a media crew and the crowds were relatively dispersed .\nThe fire also coincided with a power cut that plunged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peacefully occupied public buildings , without engaging in any property damage \u2014 even returning a large sum of money found inside the president \u2019 s residence \u2014 so a small group engaging in this act of violence , under the cover of darkness , remains suspicious .\nThe GGG put out an Action Plan for the Future of Struggle on July 5 articulating a set of six demands .\nThe main demand is the resignation of the president , followed by the PM and the government .\nNext is the demand for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic , social and political aims and aspirations of the janatha aragalya ( peoples struggle ) \u201d .\nThis demand includes several other concerns such as \u201c a programme for the provision and distribution of essentials such as food , fuel , gas and the provision of facilities such as education , health , public transport and energy \u201d .\nThe next two demands focus on a new constitution that endorses people \u2019 s sovereignty to be established through a referendum and a timeframe for the implementation of the proposals .\nThe final @ @ @

July 10 .\nThe main aim was to encourage an informed educated citizenry , which can deepen democratic values in order to recognise and refuse authoritarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resignation will not take place until July 13 , there is some apprehension among activists .\nThis democratic people \u2019 s movement emerged in response to the degeneration of representative politics ( political parties and the electoral system ) that have failed to respond to public demands .\nAlong with the sheer size of the mass gathering , the commitment to non-violence , independence from political parties and a

amidst the current surge in COVID-19 cases in the country .\nHowever , Dr. Mary Ann Bunyi , president of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society of the Philippines , said in 2021 that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 10 percent of the country \u2019 s total cases.\n\u201d She added that children have strong resistance to the coronavirus disease , where those infected only manifest mild symptoms .\nAgainst this scientific evidence , VP and EduSec Duterte maintained that pediatric vaccination is not mandatory and \u201c co-mingling of vaccinated and unvaccinated learners will be allowed in the classrooms.\n\u201d In conjunction with the VP \u2019 s pronouncement , President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. declared that overall mandatory vaccination is not necessary and that a law is not required , acknowledging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNonetheless , he still advocates for vaccination and the benefits one gets from getting vaccinated , essentially turning a blind eye to cases of adverse events and deaths .\nHis administration also plans for a massive vaccination campaign to be spearheaded by the Department of Health , Department of the Interior and Local Government , and the Department of Education .\nThe \u201c mandatory vaccination \u201d buzzword is often denied by the national administration but is de facto implemented in systemic levels , giving workers in both government agencies and private sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccinated or get terminated .\nIf President Marcos Jr. is straightforward in his non-mandatory vaccination strategy , he must shape a more rigorous policy that penalizes employers pursuing mandatory vaccination .\nAfter all , didn \u2019 t he say , \u201c We don \u2019 t really need to pass it into a law because we can still choose what \u2019 s best for our

\u2019 meant but the question went unanswered .\nThe FOI documents obtained include \u2018 Talking Points \u2019 prepared for the Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus on 2 June 2022 titled , \u2018 Julian Assange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking points and background \u2019 .\nThey point out that : Prisoner transfers can not be agreed between governments in advance of a person being a prisoner ( after a criminal

after the prisoner has been convicted and sentenced ; If surrendered , convicted and sentenced in the US , Assange could apply under the ITP scheme to serve his sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document continues : However , the UK High Court \u2019 s judgment does note that the US has provided an assurance that they will consent to Mr Assange being transferred to Australia to serve any custodial sentence on him if he is convicted .\nThis document is a list of Talking Points and Background information on Julian Assange and the International Transfer of Prisoners Scheme , prepared for

Document provided through FOI , Attorney-General \u2019 s Department ) The FOI documents also show that on 8 June 2022 , the Attorney-General , Mark Dreyfus , signed a \u2018 Ministerial Submission \u2019 titled \u2018 Julian Assange \u2013 extradition request from the United States to the United Kingdom \u2019 which recommended that the Attorney-General note the current status of the Julian Assange extradition proceedings in the UK , including that : \u2022 The matter is currently with the UK Secretary of State for the Home Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 June 2022 ( that deadline can be extended on application to the Court ) .\n\u2022 The UK Supreme Court determined in March 2022 that Mr Assange is eligible for surrender to the US by refusing him leave to appeal against the High Court \u2019 s decision of December 2021 .\n\u2022 If Mr Assange is extradited , convicted and sentenced in the US , he may apply for transfer to Australia under the International Transfer of Prisoner

make a final decision on Mr Assange \u2019 s extradition to the US by 20 June .\nMr Assange will have one final avenue of appeal with the leave of the High Court , otherwise he must be extradited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State \u2019 s decision.\n\u2019 This document is a Ministerial Submission on the International Transfer of Prisoners Scheme prepared for the Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus , and signed by him on 8 June 2022 .\n( Image : Document provided through FOI , Attorney-General \u2019 s Department ) \u2018 If Mr Assange is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment in the US , it will be possible

minister in the state into whose prison Mr Assange would be transferring .\nIn making any such decision , the department would provide you with advice on factors such as the extent to which the transfer would assist the prisoner \u2019 s rehabilitation , sentence enforcement , community safety and any relevant humanitarian considerations , in addition to any conditions of transfer required by the US.\n\u2019 Information under the headings \u2018 Government representations and consulate engagement \u2019 and \u2018 Key risks and mitigation \u2019 are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the Australian Government has specifically asked the United States to drop the case against Assange or taken into account things like Assange \u2019 s medical condition .\nA review by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner ( OAIC ) has been sought to try to get access to the redacted information .\nPresumably , one of the key risks that must be considered by the Australian Government is the risk of suicide .\nIn the judgment of presiding UK District Judge , Vanessa Baraitser , she outlines the evidence provided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neuropsychiatry at King \u2019 s College London and until 31 May 2015 , a consultant neuropsychiatrist at St Thomas \u2019 s Hospital , who carried out a comprehensive investigation of Assange \u2019 s psychiatric history .\nHe considered there to be an abundance of known risk factors indicating a very high risk of suicide including the intensity of Mr Assange \u2019 s suicidal preoccupation and the extent of his preparations .\nImportantly , he stated : \u201c I am as confident as a psychiatrist ever can be that , if extradition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis added ] , Mr Assange will find a way of suiciding.\n\u201d It is worth noting that the District Judge , Vanessa Baraitser , accepted the medical opinion of Professor Kopelman and found him to be \u2018 impartial \u2019 and \u2018 dispassionate \u2019 .\nIf the extradition in and of itself is a trigger for suicide , then any discussions about where Assange may be housed on US soil pre- and post-trial and under what restrictive measures becomes completely immaterial .\nThe presence of large redactions in the documents may suggest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government has not ruled out the extradition of Assange to US soil .\nThe imprecise language of the Labor government statements on using \u201c quiet diplomacy \u201d to \u201c bring the matter to a close \u201d , rather than clearly saying what they are seeking , may be giving false hope to the Australian public .\nWithout putting forward its \u201c quiet diplomacy \u201d in non-negotiable terms to the US , it may be that the dropping of charges will not even be considered .\nOn 17 June 2022 a Joint Statement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Attorney-General , Mark Dreyfus , was released .\nIt noted that : We will continue to convey our expectations that Mr Assange is entitled to due process , humane and fair treatment , access to proper medical care , and access to his legal team .\nThe Australian Government has been clear in our view that Mr Assange \u2019 s case has dragged on for too long and that it should be brought to a close .\nWe will continue to express this view to the governments of the United Kingdom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Attorney-General , Mark Dreyfus , told ABC Radio National \u2019 s Law Report that : The United States has long legislated in an extraterritorial way and I think that all other countries have understood that for a long time .\nWhat we have in the case of Julian Assange is an Australian citizen , who is presently held in a British jail , who is subject to an extradition request made by the United States of America , which has an extradition treaty with the United Kingdom .\nIt is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfere with either the jailing of Mr Assange in the United Kingdom , or the extradition request that \u2019 s been made by the United States to the United Kingdom .\nWhat is available to an Australian Government , and the Prime Minister has made this very clear , and I \u2019 ve said this as well , we think that the case of Julian Assange has gone on for far too long .\nWhat is available to the Australian Government is making diplomatic representations .\nBut as the Prime Minister has said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in private\u2026 .\nit \u2019 s about what we can put to the United States Government , which is the moving party here .\nIf extradited from the UK , and then tried and convicted in the US , Assange faces a cumulative total of up to 175 years imprisonment .\nHis charges attract a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison on each count of violating the US \u2019 s Espionage Act of 1917and a maximum penalty of five years for the single count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Policy \u2019 states \u2013 among other things \u2013 that : A parole eligibility date will be determined as part of the sentence enforcement in Australia .\nThe earliest possible release date in the sentencing country will be enforced as the parole eligibility date .\nIf an earliest possible release date has not been determined by the sentencing country , Australia will propose a non-parole period that is 66 per cent of the original sentence imposed by the foreign country .\nHowever , if the original sentence imposed by the foreign country significantly exceeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposed in Australia for a similar offence , Australia will propose a non-parole period that equates to 66 per cent of the maximum sentence that could be imposed in Australia for a similar offence .\nRelease on parole will be discretionary in accordance with the relevant Australian processes and laws .\nWhere possible , the parole eligibility date will be at least 12 months before the sentence expiry date .\nSome draw parallels to the case of David Hicks , an Australian who had received militant training in Afghanistan before being detained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was subsequently incarcerated in Guantanamo Bay detention camp from 2002 to 2007 .\nBut they place no weight on the fact that Hicks did not want to plead guilty to any offence , in any plea deal to free him .\nIn his book , Guantanamo : My Journey , Hicks wrote : If I refused to sign these new extra documents the Australian government would not take me .\nThe consular official threatened me with this himself and [ lawyer Michael ] Mori agreed and said I had no choice .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ or have anything to do with the commissions or plea deals , but my fear of being left behind was great .\nOnce again I was forced into doing something I did not want to do .\nJulian Assange will no doubt take a similarly principled approach in any negotiations and may well refuse to agree to any plea deal .\nOne can see why a plea to an offence carrying a lower maximum term such as conspiracy to commit computer intrusion , with a non-parole period and sentence to be served in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Government which wants to avoid offending an ally and says it is eager to \u2018 bring the matter to an end \u2019 on negotiated terms without Government pronouncements .\nBut this requires the Australian Government to accept assurances contradicted by everything the United States has done to Assange for over a decade , and by its previous failure to comply with its own assurances in other cases , to ignore the medical opinion of Professor Kopelman and risk of Assange \u2019 s extradition-related suicide , to turn a blind eye to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or incorporated

see in the public history displayed within the port districts of Yokohama , Kobe and Nagasaki .\nSilence marks the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the restoration of Japan \u2019 s own sovereignty and the simultaneous stripping away of others .\nThis work explores the state and left-unstated reasoning behind Meiji Japan \u2019 s elevation to become the first non-western power utilising the authors photography of the public history of Japanese ports and their indispensable rail and communications connections.1 It has been observed that technological change is a political process , and while this certainly is often the case , in Meiji Japan , the inverse could be argued : political change was a technological process ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Contemporary visitors , domestic and foreign , to Japanese ports such as Yokohama , Kobe , Nagasaki and others are able to spend several days exploring the public history of these gateways between Japan and the world .\nThe focus of the public history , of these cities , centres primarily on their emergence during the Meiji period ( 1868-1912 ) of Japanese history .\nThe story of Meiji Japan \u2019 s rise to modern governance and the establishment of the foundations for a modern national and global economy has been thoroughly explored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full here .\nAs works by Najita ( 1974 , 1993 ) , Giffard ( 1994 ) , Fallows ( 1995 ) , Morris-Suzuki ( 1994 ) , Samuels ( 1994 ) , Beasley ( 1995 ) , Sims ( 2001 ) , Andressen ( 2002 ) , Miyoshi ( 2005 ) , Schuman ( 2009 ) , Studwell ( 2013 ) , Tang ( 2011 , 2014 ) , Kasza ( 2018 ) and

Henceforth , the transfer of western technology to Japan would become a notable aspect of Japan \u2019 s interaction with western civilization : small initially , but accelerating at an amazing pace during the Meiji period .\nThe accumulative effect of which would be to transform Japan under Emperor Mutsuhito \u2019 s reign ( 1868-1912 ) .\nThis work will examine , through both writing and a selection of photographs taken by the authors , the economic and international trade history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities of Yokohama , Kobe and Nagasaki and now only partially reflected through public history .\nThis paper will show how this public history opens avenues for the exploration of in what ways the historic ports of Yokohama , Kobe and Nagasaki offer a means of understanding how the Meiji men of Japan learnt about the world they wished to catch up with , and , simultaneously drove seismic changes within Japan .\nMore specifically , Japan \u2019 s advancements included : political , governance , agricultural reforms , infrastructure development ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater foreign trade , policy reforms in adherence with adoption of the global default \u2018 gold standard \u2019 , and the introduction of foreign human capital and others public policy initiatives ( Hoshi & Kashyap , 2001 ; Plung , 2021 ) .\nUltimately , however , the ports and their development ( including that of their essential partners in the form of rail and the telegraph ) , highlights the central driving force behind the Meiji Restoration : the elevation of Japan to full sovereign , strategic , economic and social equality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain , continental European and the United States of America ) that had denied Japan such status through the unequal treaty system imposed upon the nation from the 1850s onwards ( Najita , 1974 ; Sukehiro , 1988 ; Auslin , 2004 ; Holcombe , 2011 ; Iokibe and Minohara , 2017 ) .\nThe most significant expression of this national transformation through adoption , adaptation and development of a modern industrial nation \u2019 s systems took place in the form of an unprecedented ( in both scale and scope ) mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place from late-1871 to 1873 ( Kume , 1871-1873 ; Miyoshi , 2005 ; Caprio , 2020 ) .\nThe Embassy fulfilled the fifth element of The Charter Oath ( Gokajo no Goseimon ) with outlined the core objectives of the Restoration of the Emperor : 5 .\nKnowledge shall be sought throughout the world so as to invigorate the foundation of Imperial rule ( Hane Mikiso as cited in Sims , 2001 : 11 ) .\nThe Embassy , as with either a single individual Japanese person or a large collective of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific purpose : to accumulate knowledge that would strengthen the emperor \u2019 s rule not only domestically , but within any other territory acquired under his banner .\nKnowledge acquisition was to be on empirical studies with a high level of transferability that built the Japanese state that operated under the emperor .\nFor any other purpose , personal aesthetics , pleasure or other , knowledge acquisition was for-all-intent-and-purposes a treasonable act .\nOne of the two chroniclers of the Embassy , Kunitake Kume ( 1871-1873 , Vol 1 : 4 ) would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the product of and captured forces changing not only Japan \u2019 s trajectory , but the concert of nations : When we consider what has happened , we realize that everything was related to changes in the trend of world affairs .\nWhatever knowledge was beyond the shores of Japan that could position the emperor to consolidate his domestic rule and elevate him and his nation to new predominance amongst the league of nations , it was the duty of those sent abroad in whatever capacity to acquire it .\nThe Embassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel across the United States of America , Great Britain and continental Europe .\nInitially , the mission held the aim of revisions to the unequal treaty system , and , to empirically examine and document the political , policy and developmental processes taking place in the advanced nations that would enable Japan to begin its ascendancy ( Chang , 2002 ) .\nHowever , the Iwakura men would come to conclude during their early-1872 time in Washington D.C. through extensive diplomatic dialogues ( with U.S. Secretary of State Hamilton Fish , European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and through communications with Meiji diplomats in London ) , that that unequal treaty revisions at this time were undesirable .\nInstead , the travellers moved concertedly and energetically to focus the purpose of the Embassy to extensively documenting the politics , governance , agrarian , financial , industrial , educational and socio-civic advantages that the western powers held over Japan ( Kume , 1871-1873 ; Caprio , 2020 ) .\nThe Iwakura Embassy \u2019 s contemporary prominence in Japanese public memory is highlighted by the establishment of a park on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribute to the execution of this extraordinary accomplishment .\nImage 2 .\nJapanese and English language description of the Iwakura Mission \u201c Departure point of modernization of Japan \u201d ( author supplied ) Domestically the powerful merchant houses that had been established during the earlier Tokugawa Period ( also known as the Edo Period 1600-1868 ) , like the nation itself , had split in their support/opposition to the Meiji elite \u2019 s Restoration of the young Emperor Mutsuhito in 1868 , and so , not surprisingly , the new rulers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this classes \u2019 advancement ( Cohen , 2014 ) .\nAs it would prove the Tokugawa merchant class was either reluctant to , or simply incapable of , supplying the vast levels of finances and human capital required for the new industrial infrastructure projects ( such as railways and port-harbour facilities ) .\nThese investment demands rendered short-term returns unlikely and further accentuated the gap between the new regime \u2019 s nation building industrial requirements and the private sectors capabilities ( Sims , 2001:6-7 ) .\nAs a result , the Ministry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regime in the year of its founding , 1868 , to promote the introduction of western technology into Japan and a loan was floated in the City of London , Great Britain \u2019 s center of banking finance , for the building of Japan \u2019 s first railroad-telegraph line \u2013 from Yokohama to Tokyo ( Free , 2008 ) .\nAt this time any dialogue on railways , ports , the telegraph and others , like so much of the Meiji regime policy agenda , was in fact a proxy for the deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation \u2019 s future , inclusive of the importation of \u2018 the foreign \u2019 to secure modernity ( Free , 2008 ; Walthall , 2018 ) .\nAs a result , a highly secretive meeting on the question of Japan \u2019 s first rail line was held at the house of Prince Sanjo Sanemtomi ( 1837-1891 ) , Minister of the Right and acting-Premier , on December 7 , 1869 ( Vlastos , 1995 ) .\nIt would be between the very top echelon of the Meiji ruling elite , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long-time confident of the Meiji Emperor and future head of the famous 1871-1873 Embassy in his name ( Caprio , 2020 ) , and the British Minister to Japan , Sir Harry Smith Parkes ( 1828-1885 : formal title Her Majesty \u2019 s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary and Consul General for the United Kingdom to the Empire of Japan from 1865-1883 ) to decide the route options between : Tokyo-Yokohama ; Kobe-Kyoto and Tokyo-Kyoto .\nAt this time , and until the first decades of the next century , Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic and industrial partner , a position Parkes vehemently promoted at every opportunity and that left neither the Japanese , the Americans , nor the continental Europeans , in any doubt of their own relative status ( Keene , 2002 ) .\nIn the end , the Tokyo-Yokohama route was selected due to the rise of Tokyo as the political center of Japan , its commercial predominance , and the critically the flat alluvial geography that favored rail development ( Free , 2008 Ch 3 ; Tang , 2014 ) .\nIrrespective of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern within the government over hostility to the recruitment of the many foreigners needed for their expertise in rail projects development and execution ( Plung , 2021 ) .\nReactionary forces made no secret of the fact that their tolerance of the modern and the foreign was limited .\nThe ports , and the essential rail and telegraph developments , would be the most visible physical expression of the national changes taking place under the new regime , and hence ripe for both verbal and physical attack upon them .\nA rail spike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West , was in Japan an avowedly political act ( Chang , 1996 , 2002 ; Low and Gooday , 1998 ; Tang , 2011 ; Ferguson , 2017 ; Kasza , 2018 ) .\nWhilst in the former ports , rail and ocean-going steam vessels represented superiority in the form of the industrial revolution taking place , in developing nations like Japan which had yet to initiate such advancements this state-of-affairs represented an inferiority of their very being as both a people and a nation ( Chang , 2002 ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to successfully achieve national industrialization , development , and colonialism both disproved Social Darwinist European thinking , and rhetoric , and enabled the Meiji regime to project Japanese racial superiority and these same limitations upon their Asiatic neighbors ( Sukehiro , 1988 ; Iriye , 1995 ; Zohar , 2020 ) .\nThe Meiji men never possessed doubts that they as Japanese could achieve the developmental levels of the Western powers ; the 1860 exploits of the Kanrin Maru under the leadership of Admiral Yoshitake Kimura and his first Japanese-only crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant act of self-reinforcement .\nThe only real question challenge in their mind was how fast they could catch up , and in doing so dispense with the unequal treaty system , so as to be on a fully equal sovereign-developmental footing with the European industrial powers .\nTo oversee not only the development of rail , but also the ports , mines and agrarian developments to complete the supply chain , and to secure the foreign expertise needed , the new Meiji government established a Ministry of Industry in December 1870 with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1841-1909 ) becoming its vice-minister in 1871 ( Yoshitake , 1986 ; Takii , 2014 ; Caprio ) .\nIto who had already travelled overseas as a student in London ( 1863 ) and to the United States of America to study currency ( 1870 ) would serve as one of Iwakura \u2019 s deputies throughout the Embassy .\nBased on the experience of Ito and others , young members of the Embassy would remain in the United States of America and European nations it would visit to undertake continuing formal studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as essential to the advancement of their nation ( at institutions such as Rutgers College and the U.S .\nNaval Academy at Annapolis ) .\nThese individuals , or others who had made their way to the America and Europe as individuals or within smaller missions and also stayed on , often for years , to study , would return to Japan in time to take up leading roles within the Meiji regime ( for example Tanaka Fujimaro who after the United States would spent time touring several European countries examining education reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to execute the resulting reforms through the Ministry of Education ) .\nDespite the new Ministry of Industry \u2019 s technical assistance , easy credit , and subsidies , the Meiji regime \u2019 s initial private-sector development drive throughout the early 1870s was a failure .\nJapan at this time was in every sense of the word a severely underdeveloped agrarian state in relation to the western powers , with the industrial structures and manufactures being defined as basic and of poor quality ( Sukehiro , 1988 ; Sugiyama , 1994 ; Andressen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferguson , 2001 , 2004 , 2017 ; Green , 2017 ) .\nMany private sector enterprises simply went bankrupt due to a lack of human capital , financial management skills and broader knowledge of international industry and trade requirements .\nThis private-sector failure left the Meiji elite with little choice other than to take an increasingly state-interventionist approach , including dramatically increasing its technical transfer commitments ( Morris-Suzuki , 1994 ; Schuman , 2009 ; Studwell , 2013 ) .\nBuilding upon the already considerable skills of the Tokugawa artisans , technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regime members through numerous other study missions abroad .\nEighteen sixty had seen the first official Japanese mission of the Tokogawa regime to the United States of America and in particular the national capital of Washington D.C. to ratify a treaty on May 22 ( 1860 ) , but it had been sent in near total secrecy , consisted of only a few members , and had very little impact domestically or internationally .\nThe Iwakura Embassy of 1871 to 1873 , in stark contrast , consisted of 70 members of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or would become significant figures within the Meiji regime for decades to come .\nEnvoy Extraordinary Ambassador Plenipotentiary and Prime Minister Iwakura Tomomi , who as stated was a long time confident of the young Mutsuhito , was supported by four vice-Ambassadors who would themselves become national figures : Ito Hirobumi ( 1841-1909 ) , Kido Koin ( also known as Kido Takayoshi ( 1833-1877 ) ) , Okubo Toshimichi ( 1830-1878 ) ; and Yamaguchi Naoyoshi ( 1839-1894 ) ( Kume , 1871-1873 ; Gluck in Miyoshi , 2005 ; Takii , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Far from being a secret mission , the Iwakura Embassy \u2019 s departure from Yokohama Port was openly celebrated by the regime ( and as evidenced by Images 1 and 2 , is still acknowledged as a seminal event in Japanese public history ) as reflecting the nation \u2019 s moves towards sovereign equality and modernity .\nIndeed , the mission \u2019 s size , scale and duration abroad , unlike the Satsuma and Chosun secret missions to England in 1865 , made any hope of keeping it secret from the regime \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly come to recognize in Washington D.C. in the early months of 1872 just how unprepared they themselves and their nation were for any substantive revisions to the unequal treaty system ( Kume , 1871-73 ; Auslin , 2004 ) .\nIn relation to the latter , obtaining vast amounts of information and knowledge on questions of economic modernity , such as the development of modern internal improvement such as ports and rail , the mission was an undeniable success .\nVisitors to the port of Yokohama can learn of the Iwakura Embassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park with several information boards , but that in no way can tell the whole story .\nAs is the nature of any port the full story encompasses both those who have left , either permanently or to return , and those foreigners who either entered and remained , or themselves would depart Japan for other shores ( Plung , 2021 ) .\nThe obtaining of foreign knowledge through the mission would be insufficient , as a lone measure , and the Meiji regime had to at a very heavy cost import foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFor example , by 1879 the Ministry of Mines employed 130 foreigners whose salaries accounted for three-fifths of the ministry \u2019 s expenditure ( Reischauer and Craig , 1989 : 146-148 ; Miyoshi 2005 : 178 ) .\nThe emphasis placed on the foreign advisers as educationalists-trainers made clear the Meiji leadership \u2019 s intent : those Japanese benefitting from the education-training were to take over these foreigners \u2019 roles as soon as practically possible to avoid dependency ( as evidenced in Images 3 , 4 , and 5 the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly visible against the traditional Japanese architecture ) .\nSuch a stand fell within the broader political economy context of the regime itself with Japan having lost substantial elements of its sovereignty under the unequal treaty system and the Meiji leadership \u2019 s extensive knowledge of European and American colonialism in broader Asia3 ( Iriye , 1995 ; Auslin , 2004 ; Pilling , 2014 ; Green , 2017 ; Zohar , 2020 ) .\nThe monumental cost of the foreign advisors and the pressing need to establish economic development as a counterweight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in substantive national development progress .\nFor example , through the establishment of Regional Development Boards , most notably the Hokkaido Development Board ( Kaitakushi ) in 1871 , the Meiji State undertook agricultural , fisheries , timber and mineral developments .\nAll required the development of a national network of rails , ports , all-weather-roads , and communications developments in the form of the telegraph across both land and seas to secure these gains.4 During this era of small government , the period of 1885-1889 saw investment in fixed capital increase above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1.7 percent of the GNP .\nBy the end of the period , 1910 to 1914 , with the Meiji reign coming to an end in 1912 , investment in fixed capital would rapidly expand to 27.7 percent of total government expenditure and 4.5 percent of the GNP ( Yasuba and Dhiravegin , 1985 : 21-25 ) .\nThis change was not ideologically driven but instead a pragmatic response on the part of the Meiji government elite to both domestic and international political , strategic , and economic imperatives ( Cameron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2007 ; Teramoto and Minohara , 2017 ) .\nSubstantial studies of the contemporary Japanese elite bureaucracy acknowledge that its key characteristics were all formed in the Meiji period ( Beasley , 1988 ; Beasley , 1995 ; Koh , 1989 ; Johnson , 1982 , 1995 ) .\nThe Ministry of Finance ( MoF ) , established in 1868 , the year of the Restoration , and the Ministry of Industry , established in 1881 , have been the most-thoroughly internationally documented.5 Having observed through the seminal Iwakura Embassy and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , American , and German administrative elite , and in particularly those responsible for the national budgetary process , the Meiji regime framed its substantive reforms within the context of embracing the Confucian tradition .\nThe Meiji elite moved to institute national civil-service examination system in 1880 .\nFor the Meiji elite this selection into their ranks via rigorous examination legitimised public officials with moral authority as servants of the Emperor to promote the public good including the development of internal improvements , state enterprises and the harnessing of \u2018 private \u2019 enterprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s sovereignty and prosperity ( Johnson , 1982 , 1995 ; Muchlhoff , 2014 ) .\nHaving removed the samurai as a class and abolished their daimyo provincial loyalties , the Meiji elite redirected loyalty ties to the central bureaucracy as separate fiefdoms in themselves ( Miyoshi , 2005 : 91 ) .\nTraditional clan loyalty based on geographic locations was , over the duration of the Meiji Emperor \u2019 s reign , to be replaced with another form of clan loyalty ; one based on educational attainment , and which transcended government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation \u2019 s major corporations in state banking , finance , rail , ports , manufactures and others ( Fingleton , March/April 1995 : 77 ) .\nThe Meiji state requirement to build the internal improvements needed to secure Japan \u2019 s rise in international stature saw the bureaucracy almost double between 1880 and 1890 .\nFurther from 1890 to 1903 administrative expenditure grew from 31 million to 121 million and government employees grew from 79,000 to 144,000 ( Sims , 2001 : 65 & 91-92 ) .\nThe continuity of Japan \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Johnson , 1995 ) .\nUnder the 1890 Constitution \u2019 s diffusion of power , the system by which every ministry jealously guards its nawabari ( sphere of influence ) and all ministry members develop nawabari ishiki ( territorial consciousness ) was formally instituted .\nThe primary vehicle for this institutionalisation of bureaucratic divisions were ( and remain ) intense competition over the national budget .\nAt the apex of this new clan loyalty was the Ministry of Finance ( MoF ) , the guardian of the nation \u2019 s finances through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 1890 Constitution institutionalised this MoF bureaucratic elite predominance as it placed a decisive limitation upon the powers of the Diet , one borrowed from Berlin in that if it failed to pass the national budget the government could continue its operation based on the preceding year \u2019 s budget ( Storry , 1978 ) .\nThe MoF , in practice , held the whip hand over the Diet and would maintain the 1890 budgetary constitution to control the Meiji government apparatus with all other bureaucratic institutions and agencies required to pass their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All nation building projects , including the development of ports , rail , the telegraph , all-weather roads , the establishment of trade financing and logistics entities , all were either driven from , or required , the explicit approval and financing of the MoF .\nCritically , though it is important to understand that whilst the MoF stood at the apex of the Meiji regime bureaucratic hierarchy , it was ultimately under the authority of the Emperor .\nMutsuhito more than once would show a willingness to reign-in his senior governing elite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he felt the state revenue-expenditure balance had reached a precipitous .\nThis was particularly so during the first decades of his reign ( 1870s-1890s ) ( Keen , 2002 ) .\nThe MoF , nevertheless , went further than mere mastery over the bureaucracy and established its grip over the national economy through embedding its alumni into the nation \u2019 s major state and \u2018 private \u2019 corporations , inclusive of the banking and trade entities that drove Japan \u2019 s engagement with the world , as a continuation of their loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MoF clan ( Patrick , 1965 ; Hoshi and Kashyap , 2001 ) .\nThe rise of the MoF was not ideological but strategically pragmatic as it was only utilised when it was deemed essential to the national interests , with the Meiji elite preferring to use the private sector where applicable and to engage in state intervention through the MoF and other Meiji agencies for the building of rail and ports only when the market proved itself incapable of delivering nation-building .\nA working model of private-driven rapid nation-building economic development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The MoF \u2019 s direct control over an economic base independent of the private sector , including the banking sector and a vast array of state-owned enterprises , provided the bureaucratic elite with strategic control over capital , materials , labour and national economic planning ( Chu , 1994:118 ) .\nEx-officials from the MoF would come quickly to dominate the executive level within both public and \u2018 private \u2019 financial , internal improvements , rail , ports , roads , the telegraph , and other institutions ( institutions such as the Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank of Japan ( EIBJ ) ; Tokyo Stock Exchange ; Bank of Tokyo ; Yokohama Bank ; and others ) .\nJapan \u2019 s action in fact mirrored those of London , Berlin and Washington D.C. , in that they pragmatically evaluated their own contextual environment and circumstances and adopted , adapted and developed old and new policy and practice models and behaviors to achieve eventual success .\nAs this study has detailed the Meiji men observed and extensively documented first-hand through the Iwakura Embassy and other smaller missions the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and institutions , and quickly came to conclude that far from being the product of Adam Smith \u2019 s invisible hand of the market , the international powers \u2019 predominance in arms , finance and trade was in fact the product of the long-term concerted actions of the respective state-activist elites driving these respective nations ( Kume , 1871-1873 ; Fukui , 1992 ; Iriye , 1995 ; Takii , 2014 ) .\nIn recognition of their military importance to Japan , the Meiji elite developed railways , shipping and communication services ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of both government-and-private enterprises to achieve projects of national significance .\nFor example , Emperor Mutsuhito himself took a deep personal interest in every aspect of Japan \u2019 s development of a deep-water navy , with Japan \u2019 s first western battleship being purchased from the United States of America .\nThis was hardly surprising when one considers that it was the naval power of the United States of America , Great Britain and other western powers that completely discredited the Tokugawa regime \u2019 s capacity to protect the nation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s studies extended to undertaking extensive personal studies of both western powers \u2019 battleship developments and the required internal improvement , such as corresponding deep-water ports and the rail networks needed to supply the coal , iron ore , timber and other resources , along with the construction and maintenance of these colossal state investments ( Keene , 2002 ) .\nIn this , the Meiji Emperor and his leading men were systematic in following the actions of the United States , Britain and continental Europe , actions many themselves had witnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1871-1873 ) .\nThe Railway Construction Act of 1892 coordinated a national network which rose in the 1883 to 1903 period from 245 miles to 4,500 miles , with 70 percent being constructed by private-enterprise , and , in 1906 , state ownership was secured through the Railway Nationalisation Bill ( see Table ) .\nImage 6 .\nCornerstone/foundation stone of the Port of Yokohama ( author supplied ) Along with this rapid development in internal improvement , a similar pattern of incentives and penalties was used in ports , rail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textiles , low-end tool manufactures , steam-machinery and later chemical , metal products , and machinery .\nThrough the direct import and development of British technology , the textile sector ( at first silk production and exportation ) , in particular , expanded to occupy nearly 30 percent of value-added manufactures throughout the 1890 to 1930 period , the next largest , at 16 percent , was food and drink ( Beasley , 1995 : 110 ; Reischauer and Craig , 1989 : 149 ) .\nUnder the new Meiji policy-loan scheme the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ output in the GDP grew from 13.7 percent in 1873-1874 to 43.7 percent in 1930-1939 .\nFurthermore , through sustained technological importation and innovation , manufacturing rose from 6 percent of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) by 1900 to 30 percent by 1945 .\nFukui ,

and enabled the Meiji regime through a network of rail-telegraph to expand its reach into the most remote of villages .\nThe Meiji elite coming from isolated regional provinces themselves fully understood the political importance of rapid and effective communication from the centre to the periphery , and vice versa to the permanency of their regime .\n\u2022 The first railway link , from

crack down on the protests that toppled his predecessor , condemning them as \u201c against the law \u201d .\nSpeaking after being MPs picked him as successor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not tolerate those he perceived to be stirring up violence .\n\u201c If you try to topple the government , occupy the president \u2019 s office and the prime minister \u2019 s office , that is not democracy ; it is against the law , \u201d he said .\n\u201c We will deal with them firmly according to the law .\nWe will not allow a minority of protesters to suppress the aspirations of the silent majority clamoring for a change in the political system.\n\u201d Wickremesinghe is expected to name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolmate Dinesh Gunawardena as prime minister on Thursday .\nGunawardena is known as a strong Rajapaksa loyalist , and served as a cabinet when Mahinda Rajapaksa was president , and then again when Gotabaya Rajapaksa was president .\nIn recent days , Wickremesinghe , who declared a state of emergency this week , had made statements calling protesters \u201c fascists \u201d and indicating he would not be afraid to crack down on the demonstrations .\nLess than an hour after he was declared president on Wednesday , a court order was issued prohibiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a statue that stands at Galle Face in Colombo , where protesters spurred by the country \u2019 s economic collapse have been camped out for months .\nHowever , people defied the order and dozens gathered on the steps of the president \u2019 s offices , which are still occupied by the protest movement , to shout rallying cries of \u201c deal Ranil \u201d \u2013 a reference to Wickremesinghe \u2019 s reputation as a scheming politician \u2013 as well as \u201c Ranil bank robber \u201d , referring to a bank bond scam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police and military stood on the periphery but did not interfere in the rally .\nAfter being selected by MPs as president , Wickremesinghe called on the opposition parties for an \u201c end to division \u201d and said he wanted to \u201c bring everyone together so that a national consensus is formed as to the way forward \u201d .\nBut questions remain over whether Wickremesinghe would be able to put together a cross-party unity government acceptable to the people , after the major opposition parties had pledged their support for the presidential candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister six times and is close to the Rajapaksa family .\nProtesters fear that he will protect the Rajapaksas from being held accountable , as he has been accused of doing in the past , and would not instigate the constitutional change being demanded by the protest movement , including an end to the system of executive presidency .\nWickremesinghe is due to serve for the rest of Rajapaksa \u2019 s term , until November 2024 .\nRanil Does Not Have Mandate \u201c Ranil will be chased away , he is a crook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d said Anura Goonaratna , 53 , a toy exporter .\n\u201c This protest movement is going to get worse .\nThere has to be an end to this and the only ending we will accept is throwing Ranil out , whatever it takes.\n\u201d Analysts have disputed the China debt-trap narrative in Sri Lanka .\nChina only accounts for 10 % of Sri Lanka \u2019 s debts , most of which were concessionary loans and the repayments only accounted for less than 5 % of the country \u2019 s annual foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the country \u2019 s foreign exchange reserves were international sovereign bonds , much of which are from the US , which were borrowed by the country at high interest rates .\nIt was these bond repayments \u2013 which were due to total over $ 1.5bn in 2022 \u2013 that drained Sri Lanka \u2019 s reserves and ultimately forced them to default in May , as the country was virtually bankrupt .\nRanil Wickremesinghe \u2019 s election as President could again plunge Sri Lanka into another round of political unrest and instability .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ public .\nIn some places , protests called for Ranil Wickremesinghe to quit ahead of today \u2019 s elections but these were not mass rallies .\nAccording to some analysts it may not be as easy to mobilize protests .\nAnticipating possible demonstrations , the Colombo Port Magistrate \u2019 s Court issued an order Wednesday preventing anyone from reaching within a 50 meter radius of the S.W.R.D .\nBandarnaike statute which is located at the protest site at the Galle face green in the capital .\nNeither Ranil nor the members of parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear is that this may lead to another round of street protests , calling for Ranil to quit .\nSri Lanka at the moment can ill afford another political turmoil when the President and the new government he appoints has to focus on getting the economy back on track .\nThat won \u2019 t be an easy job .\nMuch will depend on whether the protesters are back on the street and how the President tackles the fresh volley of unrest .\nRumor mills in Sri Lankans are now pointing fingers at New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nDenying these charges , the Indian High Commission in Colombo tweeted : \u201c We have seen baseless and purely speculative media reports about efforts at political level from India to influence political leaders in Sri Lanka regarding elections in the Sri Lankan Parliament to the post of the President of Sri Lanka.\n\u2019

the current Parliament .\nHe told Parliament that the composition which is shown through numbers in Parliament was not the real composition on the ground .\n\u201c There is a huge contradiction between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament , \u201d he said .\nHe said they always stood for an interim government for a short period of time headed by a President and a Prime Minister who had no future political agendas .\nHe said however , they failed to come to a consensus despite discussions with several political parties .\nDissanayake alleged that MPs had been bought over this time also just as

have a problem , \u201d the school \u2019 s vice principal , Inayatullah , told the assembled students during an outdoor flag ceremony on a recent Monday morning .\n\u201c Now tell me , \u201d

500 meters , just over a quarter of a mile , from the school is an industrial site for unloading coal shipments owned by PT Karya Citra Nusantara ( KCN ) , a company whose operation has been

.\nEven breathing \u201c feels weird , \u201d she said .\nShe said she worries about her students : almost all of them , she said , live within a 10-minute walk of where KCN \u2019 s loading site can

Mongabay , were reported by 18 % of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and eye problems by 8 % , suggesting that thousands of Marunda \u2019 s nearly 36,000 residents could be afflicted .\nFifi said further examinations would be necessary to definitively link the health problems to the coal dust .\nStill , many in the community already suspect that KCN \u2019 s operation is causing these problems , a

@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe KPAI has identified three people , two of them children , who suffered from corneal ulcers caused by KCN \u2019 s coal dust , Retno told Mongabay .\n\u201c Coal dust particles are quite large , \u201d Retno said .\n\u201c They can damage the cornea.\n\u201d According to Dr. Elvioza , an ophthalmologist at the Jakarta Eye Center , a local hospital , coal dust exposure can damage

could arise from that problem would be a corneal ulcer which can lead to blindness.\n\u201d People exposed to coal dust may also develop breathing problems , ranging from respiratory infections in the

Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement ( EDCA ) , \u201c access to designated Philippine military facilities , the right to construct facilities , and preposition equipment , aircraft , and vessels , but rules out permanent basing.\n\u201d The maverick leader flirted with the idea of cooperating with the Russian Armed Forces and China \u2019 s People \u2019 s Liberation Army , but reverted his decision and withdrew the termination of the VFA .\nThis move came amid the increasing tension in the South China Sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIncumbent president Ferdinand Marcos Jr. vowed to continue Duterte \u2019 s foreign policy trajectory , iterating the slogan , \u201c a friend to all , an enemy to none \u201d .\nBut it seems just another hot air as the country \u2019 s plans for US forces are back on track , including the building of facilities for US troops at five military bases \u2014 one in Palawan whose proximity to the South China Sea makes it conducive to conducting surveillance flights .\nFurther , the Philippine navy begins to station at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits facing the South China Sea , with a view to \u201c countering China \u2019 s increasing assertiveness in the contested waters \u201c .\nThe port authority head intimated the welcomed presence of the US navy as a balancing force against the formidable Chinese counterpart .\nThe crux of the US-Philippines joint military exercises and cooperation agreements is clear and definite : to counter China through the South China Sea crisis .\nDisaster relief , counterterrorism , etc .\nare just the tip of the iceberg .\nWhat is hidden from the Filipino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of encircling the emerging superpower \u2014 under the guise of a routine military exercise and training aimed at enriching military capabilities towards \u201c maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific region \u201c .\nThe Philippines in the event of a Taiwan-China conflict The Philippines engages in economic and trade relations with Taiwan but maintains diplomatic relations only with mainland China .\nAmid the rising tension in the Taiwan Strait , the Philippine government released a brief but straightforward message , claiming adherence to the One-China Policy and the importance of diplomacy and dialogue .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiptoeing \u201d around a major economic partner by \u201c refusing to give any more comments \u201d .\n\u201c Tiptoe \u201d is a misnomer with the ongoing US-Philippines military exercises \u2014 aimed at countering China \u2014 in the background .\nHaving US troops and military equipment in the Philippine soil , the southeast asian state will become heavily embroiled in the event of a war outbreak between Taiwan and China , given America \u2019 s expression of military support to Taipei .\nThe volatility of the security architecture in the Indo-Pacific region should prompt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military diplomacy among the concerned states .\nThe Philippines should limit , if not repeal , the provisions of the Mutual Defense Treaty with the US if it is serious in its commitment to an independent foreign policy .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on Instagram and

Myanmar partners at the official levels express their understanding of the reasons and validity of Russia \u2019 s actions in the framework of a special military operation in Ukraine .\nNaypyidaw does

its internal affairs .\nWe assist Naypyidaw in rapprochement with integration associations and mechanisms of multilateral cooperation in Eurasia , including the EAEU and the SCO.\n\u201d Indeed , Lavrov scheduled his talks in Myanmar before the ASEAN-Russia foreign ministers meet in Phnom Penh .\nThe press release issued on August 3 after Lavrov \u2019 s talks with the Chairman of the State Administrative Council , Prime Minister of the Provisional Government , Min Aung Hlaing said they held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation that is emerging against the background of the unprecedented sanctions campaign unleashed by the collective West both against Russia and against Myanmar .\nHe ( Min Aung Hlaing ) confirmed the need for coordinated steps to strengthen a multipolar world order\u2026 \u201d Myanmar becomes the second country after Iran in the Indian Ocean region that has voiced unequivocal support for Russia .\nConceivably , Lavrov may now have to visit Colombo too , once the new government is formed .\nIt is difficult to assess whether the mayhem in Sri Lanka on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impending visit of a Sri Lankan government delegation \u2019 s weeklong trip to Moscow the next day ( scheduled for July 10-16 ) to hold crucial talks with various Russian economic ministries on July 10-16 regarding Russia \u2019 s help to tide over the crisis .\nBut it remains a reasonable assumption .\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson \u2019 s remarks on July 11 regarding the Sri Lankan situation pointedly mentioned , \u201c Notably , the day before the unrest began , some Western diplomatic mission heads openly urged the local police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c We believe that the developments in Sri Lanka are its internal affair and the political process in that country , which we regard as friendly , will develop further in keeping with its constitution and effective laws .\nWe expect a new government to be formed and are ready to cooperate with it .\nWe believe the situation will return to normal before long and that the new Sri Lankan authorities will take the necessary measures to ride out the crisis in the national economy.\n\u201d Indeed , Ranil Wickremesinghe , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exclusive interview about the unprecedented nature of the political turmoil \u2014 that \u201c the island nation \u2019 s politicians can not yet find parallels to a similar crisis in this century or in the last century or the century before.\n\u201d It appears that Moscow anticipated that the US-backed unrest in Sri Lanka would fail to produce a regime change that the \u201c Collective West \u201d wanted .\nInterestingly , President Vladimir Putin in his congratulatory message to Wickremesinghe on his election as president noted , \u201c I am counting on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further development of constructive bilateral cooperation in various spheres for the benefit of our peoples and in the interest of strengthening regional stability and security.\n\u201d A glance at the map of Indian Ocean would show why relations with Iran , Myanmar and Sri Lanka have become so consequential for Russia .\nThe ports in Myanmar , Sri Lanka and Myanmar are vital to sustaining an effective Russian naval presence in the region .\nThe strategic compulsions are amplified in Russia \u2019 s revised Naval Doctrine , which Putin decreed on July 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geopolitical and military-strategic situation in the world.\n\u201d The 56-page document ( in Russian ) explicitly states that Russia \u2019 s national interests \u201c as a great naval power extend to the entire world \u2019 s oceans and the Caspian Sea \u201d .\nIt acknowledges the lack of overseas naval re-supply points and bases , which are crucial for expanding the operational range of the Russian Navy , while spotlighting that \u201c the strategic course of the US to dominate in the world oceans \u201d poses \u201c challenges and threats.\n\u201d However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a facility in the Red Sea .\nBesides , it also includes plans to construct a new shipbuilding facility in Russia \u2019 s Far East to build \u201c large-capacity vessels \u201d including ships suitable \u201c for the development of the Arctic , \u201d as well as \u201c modern aircraft carriers for the Navy.\n\u201d Currently , Russia has only one aircraft-carrying naval vessel , the Admiral Kuznetsov cruiser , which has been out of commission and undergoing repairs .\nMeanwhile , the US has been steadily strengthening a maritime cooperation grid with Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a West Asian Quad under the ingenious rubric I2U2 ( Israel-India , US-UAE ) .\nPresident Biden took its first summit meeting .\n( See here and here ) Delhi insists that I2U2 is a platform for regional economic partnerships but western strategists candidly discuss the geopolitics looming behind economics .\nMichel Gurfinkiel at the Middle East Forum wrote in Wall Street Journal , \u201c Jake Sullivan , Mr. Biden \u2019 s national security adviser , compared I2U2 to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue , the embryonic Indo-Pacific alliance of the US , Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Emirati media all see it as an extension of the 2019 Abraham Accords.\n\u201d Indeed , the longer view is even more pertinent because beyond I2U2 , the Quad and the Abraham Accords , one considers many analogous developments in international security \u2014 Ukraine conflict , NATO expansion , Eastern Mediterranean security alliance ( France , Italy , Greece , Cyprus , Israel and Egypt ) ; Negev Summit architecture ( Israel , Morocco , Egypt , UAE .\nand Bahrain ) ; AUKUS ( the born-again Anglo-Pacific defence community between Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of US-Taiwan relationship ; Japan \u2019 s militarisation ( overcoming acrimonious history ) , etc .\nIn the above backdrop , India \u2019 s gravitation toward the US-led security alliance system is a contradiction .\nIndia \u2019 s strategic focus is China but the US \u2019 s includes Russia and Iran as well .\nIndia prioritises its strategic ties with Israel \u2014the management of Haifa port ( which the US Sixth Fleet frequents ) has been awarded to an Indian company recently .\nWhereas , Israel \u2019 s and the US \u2019 obsession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards India .\nOn the other hand , Iran is strengthening its ties with Russia and China .\nPerhaps , UAE and India are playing both ends .\nBut they are also regimes lacking strategic culture and prone to whimsicality attuned to Washington \u2019 s agenda .\nClearly , the confidence in the US \u2019 reliability has been generally undermined in recent years in the swathe of land between the Levant and Malacca Straits .\nBiden \u2019 s recent initiative in Jeddah to promote a West Asian military alliance to counter Iran , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian diplomacy has to navigate between these shoals .\nThe great game in Indian Ocean region is wide open .\nLavrov \u2019 s visit to Myanmar signals that Moscow will push back the US \u2019 attempts to create \u201c blocs \u201d to dominate the Indian Ocean \u2019 s sea lanes .\nAccess to the ports in Myanmar can be a game changer for Russian presence .\nInterestingly , Min Aung Hlaing complained to Lavrov that Russian officials \u201c rarely \u201d visit Myanmar .\nLavrov promised to make amends .\nMoscow intends to fulfil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperation with Myanmar spreads wings \u2014 trade to investments in energy projects , nuclear cooperation , military-technical cooperation , space , education , etc .\nDirect flights are being established .\nMir payment cards are accepted in Myanmar , which also is also keen on settlement in local currencies .\nMoscow plans to establish in Yangon a parish of the Patriarchal Exarchate of the

pandemic , the then prime minister , Scott Morrison , swore himself in as a minister to several portfolios , including health , finance and resources .\nCan this be done ?\nFirst , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There has been reference to Morrison \u201c swearing himself in \u201d as a minister , when only the governor-general can appoint ministers .\nIt has also been said the attorney-general found a way for the governor-general to be cut out of the process by making changes by way of an administrative order .\nIt is claimed the health minister knew about and supported such action , while the finance minister and the resources minister were unaware .\nAnother news story said the Commonwealth government has presented evidence to court that the prime minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the governor-general on April 15 2021 .\nIt has since been confirmed the governor-general did appoint the prime minister to administer other ministerial portfolios , but no details have so far been provided .\nThe details of exactly what happened therefore remain unclear .\nCan ministers share the administration of legislation ?\nBecause the titles and roles of ministers change all the time , statutes tend simply to confer power on \u201c the minister \u201d , without specifying which one .\nSection 19 of the Acts Interpretation Act says that to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant \u201c Administrative Arrangements Order \u201d .\nAn Administrative Arrangements Order sets out the matters and legislation that fall within the responsibility of particular departments and their administering minister .\nFor example , during the pandemic , the Administrative Arrangements Orders said the Biosecurity Act was administered by the minister for health in relation to human health and the minister for agriculture in relation to animals and plants .\nThey did not allocate the administration of this act to the prime minister .\nThe governor-general makes Administrative Arrangements Orders on the advice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are published on the Federal Register of Legislation .\nNo such order allocates the administration of the health , finance or resources legislation to the prime minister .\nSo the only way the prime minister could exercise powers granted by that legislation was if he was also appointed , or acting , as the minister for health , finance or resources .\nThe Cabinet could reach a collective decision about a policy issue , including how a minister \u2019 s power should be exercised in relation to it , and the minister would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act consistently with that decision .\nBut the prime minister alone has no legal power to instruct a minister how to exercise powers conferred by statute on that minister .\nCan a minister exercise the powers of another minister ?\nMinisters can be struck down sick , go on holidays or be out of the country on business , so there is always a need for another minister to be able to exercise their powers .\nThis is recognised in section 19 ( 4 ) of the Acts Interpretation Act , which says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act can include a reference to another minister who is acting on behalf of the first minister .\nBut this is usually when the first minister is unavailable .\nIt is therefore different from the scenario of the prime minister simultaneously having the same powers as the ministers for health , finance and resources .\nSection 34AAB of the Acts Interpretation Act also says that a minister who administers an Act may authorise another minister to act on behalf of the first minister in exercising powers under the Act .\nThe authorisation must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this power was used if , for example , the health minister agreed to exercise it .\nBut it would not cover cases where the first minister did not choose to grant such an authorisation and did not know about it .\nIt is the governor-general who appoints ministers to particular portfolios and swears them in .\nThis happens under section 64 of the Constitution .\nIt is ordinarily done publicly , when a new ministry is being sworn in .\nThe ministerial changes are then published in the Commonwealth Gazette and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , on February 6 2020 , Keith Pitt was appointed as minister for resources , water and Northern Australia .\nBut it does not seem any ministerial change announcement was made for the appointment of the prime minister to become minister for resources in April 2021 ( or at least , I haven \u2019 t yet found it ) .\nA spokesperson for the official secretary of the governor-general stated : The Governor-General [ \u2026 ] appointed former Prime Minister Morrison to administer portfolios other than the Department of the Prime Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an administrative instrument on the advice of the prime minister .\nThe spokesperson also stated the decision whether to publicise such appointment is a matter for the government of the day .\nIs it appropriate for ministers to be secretly appointed to exercise statutory powers ?\nNo , such matters should be notified to parliament and formally published so members of the public can know who is entitled to exercise particular powers .\nThat is why we have Administrative Arrangements Orders and notifications of changes in ministerial responsibility that are recorded on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inappropriate for such matters to be kept secret \u2013 especially if it is kept secret from the Cabinet and from the minister who was formally allocated responsibility for a portfolio by the governor-general .\nSuch a lack of transparency is indicative of a lack of respect for the institutions of government and for the general public who have a right to know how power is allocated .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on

Koreans hailed the deal as a triumph for their nuclear power industry , although it made for awkward optics as their American allies push an economic pressure campaign to isolate Russia over its war on Ukraine .\nSouth Korean officials said the U.S. was consulted in advance about the deal and that the technologies being supplied by Seoul for the project would not clash with international sanctions against Russia .\nAccording to South Korea \u2019 s presidential office and trade ministry , the contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ASE requires the South Koreans to provide certain materials and equipment and construct the turbine building of the plant being built in Dabaa .\nThe Mediterranean coastal town is located about 130 kilometers ( 80 miles ) northwest of Cairo .\nA senior aide of

affected the negotiations between Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power and ASE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build four 1,200 megawatt reactors .\nChoi stressed that South Korea \u2019 s involvement in the project would not clash with international sanctions against Russia .\nYoon \u2019 s office expressed hope that South Korea \u2019 s participation in the Dabaa project would help the country gain a foothold in future nuclear projects across Africa and also improve its chances to export to countries such as the Czech Republic , Poland and Saudi Arabia .\nKorea Hydro and Nuclear Power had been engaging in negotiations with ASE as the preferred bidder for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine in late February .\nGo Myong-hyun , a senior analyst at Seoul \u2019 s Asan Institute for Policy Studies , said the deal would not have been possible without an export approval by the U.S. as the components provided by Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power likely include U.S.-originated technology .\nCurrent sanctions against Moscow also do not include specific restrictions related to nuclear energy and the Biden administration would have no interest in disrupting a crucial project for Egypt , which it sees as a key partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While South Korea \u2019 s involvement in the Dabaa project would not immediately be a problem between the allies if the Americans signed off on it , things could change depending on how Russia \u2019 s war on Ukraine goes and whether Washington expands export controls against Moscow , Go said .\nYoon \u2019 s office said the participation in the

@ @ @ @ @ that the consumption of gas in the world will increase and the tendency towards consumption of LNG has increased and they alone are not able to meet the world \u2019 s demand , so there is no room left for gas competition.\n\u201d According to OilPrice , major global LNG supplier Qatar \u2013 which has the third-largest gas reserves of just under 24 tcm \u2013 could be a prime candidate to join the Russia-Iran gas cartel .\nTogether , Russia , Iran and Qatar account for just under 60 % of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out .\nThe three countries were instrumental in the founding of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum ( GECF ) , whose 11 members control over 71 % of global gas reserves , 44 % of its marketed production , 53 % of its gas pipelines , and 57 % of its LNG exports , it

tantrum thrown by Beijing over the unauthorized visit of US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan appears instead to be a carefully thought-out strategy designed to incrementally reassert Chinese sovereignty over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to do this is underwritten by the nation \u2019 s growing military might .\nThrough a unique and powerful missile arsenal to a capable and growing air force , navy , and ground force , China has created the means through which to reverse decades of injustice , encroachment , and encirclement by the West against the Chinese people and their territory .\nEven Western analysts and military experts admit that China \u2019 s military capabilities have grown to world-class levels .\nThese capabilities will be key to achieving and defending Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through deterrence if possible , or through force if necessary .\nThroughout human history weapons have been used to give a fighting force a greater reach than their adversaries .\nBe it sword , spear , or arrow , those with the longest and most effective reach often dominate the battlefield .\nOn today \u2019 s battlefield , this reach is achieved through missiles .\nChina \u2019 s modern missile forces are the largest and most capable on Earth according to even Western analysts .\nThrough a combination of long , medium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as a variety of cruise missiles , China has the ability to hit targets near and far .\nThe US government and arms industry-funded Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) through its \u201c China Power \u201d project wrote a paper titled , \u201c How Are China \u2019 s Land-based Conventional Missile Forces Evolving ?\n, \u201d which admitted : Conventionally armed ( non-nuclear ) missiles have become an increasingly important component of military power .\nThey can be employed to deter threats or project power hundreds or thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to modernize the People \u2019 s Liberation Army ( PLA ) , China has developed one of the most powerful land-based conventional missile arsenals in the world .\nThe same paper would also admit : According to the US Department of Defense ( DoD ) , China \u2019 s missile forces in 2000 \u201c were generally of short range and modest accuracy.\n\u201d In the years since then , China has developed the world \u2019 s \u201c largest and most diverse \u201d arsenal of ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles .\nThe PLA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China \u2019 s land-based conventional and nuclear missiles , has fielded multiple new missile systems over the last several years .\nMany of these missiles are capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear payloads .\nThe paper describes cruise missiles able to hit land targets anywhere on potential battlefields like Taiwan , carrier-killer missiles reportedly able to target and destroy US carrier groups , and hypersonic missiles that can penetrate the most advanced Western missile defense systems .\nEven without the ability to penetrate Western missile defenses , the sheer number of Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China \u2019 s missile forces have been built up specifically to keep the United States and its allies from building up military forces along its periphery and thus threaten Chinese territorial integrity .\nTogether with Chinese air defenses and anti-ship systems , China has assembled formidable anti-access , area denial ( A2AD ) capabilities that would prevent US military forces from even reaching Chinese targets let alone engaging them .\nIt is also worth noting that China has developed significantly capable multiple launch rocket systems ( MLRS ) in the form of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than its US counterparts , fires them further , and with at least as much accuracy guided by China \u2019 s BeiDou Navigation Satellite System .\nA Business Insider article titled , \u201c China \u2019 s new rocket launcher system is its most powerful ever , and it \u2019 s looming over the Taiwan Strait , \u201d would note : The system is capable of firing eight 370 mm rockets a distance of 350 km or two 750 mm ballistic missiles 500 km .\nThis means that China \u2019 s MLRS capabilities can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the mainland .\nIn fact the bulk of any potential Chinese military operation regarding Taiwan and potential US intervention can be carried out from the mainland with China \u2019 s extensive and capable missile and rocket forces .\nRussian military operations in Ukraine have been defined by Russia \u2019 s own long range fires as well as A2AD .\nIt \u2019 s premier S-400 air defense system exists at the top of an ecosystem of other shorter range air defenses that when networked and layered make the air space they protect virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons like artillery and short-range ballistic missiles like the Iskander , there is nowhere for Ukrainian forces to hide and certainly no way for them to advance into Russia positions .\nBy moving these capabilities forward , Russia has been incrementally securing territory from the regime in Kiev .\nNot only has China emulated many tactics and strategies from Russia , it has also outright purchased the best the Russian Federation has to offer .\nBetween 2018-2020 China purchased two regiments of Russia \u2019 s S-400 systems .\nChina also produces a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on the Russian S-300 , Russia \u2019 s Tor system , as well as systems incorporating certain aspects of the US Patriot missile system .\nWhile Chinese air defenses have not been put to the test like their Russian counterparts , it stands to reason they would perform with similar efficiency and prevent US forces and other potential interlopers from entering Chinese airspace let alone cause damage within it .\nThe People \u2019 s Liberation Army Airforce employs hundreds of modern warplanes including the Chengdu J-10 , the Shenyang J-11 and J-16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newest warplane , the Chengdu J-20 .\nAs with Chinese air defenses , Chinese airpower has been heavily influenced by Russian military aviation .\nOver the years in addition to its own warplanes , China has purchased a number of advanced Russian warplanes including the SU-27 , SU-30 , and most recently , the SU-35 according to the Diplomat in its 2019 article , \u201c Russia Offers China Another Batch of Su-35 Fighter Jets.\n\u201d While China \u2019 s airforce has not seen combat , the fact that it possesses a large number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a similar manner to Russian airpower as demonstrated in Syria from 2015 onward and now in military operations in Ukraine .\nThe warplanes themselves are merely platforms for advanced avionics and weapons , the latter of which is a central factor defining the success of any nation \u2019 s airforce .\nThe US government and arms industry-funded International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) in a paper titled , \u201c Chinese and Russian air-launched weapons : a test for Western air dominance , \u201d would note the advancements of Chinese air-to-air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of Chinese progress in the air-to-air guided-weapons arena was apparent with the introduction of the PL-10 AAM .\nThis weapon provided a marked improvement in performance over the previous generation of short-range missiles operated by the People \u2019 s Liberation Army Air Force ( PLAAF ) , and its development has placed China among the handful of nations with a defence-industrial base capable of producing such a weapon .\nThe paper would also note : China is also developing a very-long-range AAM intended to be used to attack high-value targets such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surveillance and reconnaissance ( ISR ) aircraft .\nFurthermore , Beijing appears to be pursuing two or more configurations of rocket-ramjet AAMs .\nBy the early to mid-2020s , China will clearly have a broader \u2013 and far more capable \u2013 range of air-to-air weapons to complement the combat aircraft that are now in development .\nThese will likely force the US and its regional allies to re-examine not only their tactics , techniques and procedures , but also the direction of their own combat-aerospace development programmes .\nChinese airpower when coupled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a modern day sword and shield able to take on virtually any threat .\nOne area in which the US still dominates is through its submarine fleet .\nWhile China possesses a large number of submarines with improving capabilities , the US is still thought to have an advantage in this field .\nUS submarines could disrupt cross-strait shipping as well as threaten Chinese ground targets with submarine-launched cruise missiles .\nUS submarines would be one of the few platforms able to potentially breach Chinese A2AD capabilities .\nBecause modern submarine warfare is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from recent examples to predict possible outcomes regarding submarine warfare between the US and China and is a critical factor that only time will fully reveal .\nChinese media , cyber and space-based military capabilities would also be critical in any potential conflict and are areas the US clearly understands parity is nearly reached with its own capabilities or has already been reached .\nOther critical factors that would come into play during the most likely conflicts China faces would be the capabilities of its ground forces .\nChinese tanks and armored vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian platforms and are admittedly on par with their Western counterparts in terms of fire control , armor , and countermeasures against anti-tank missiles .\nChinese artillery also follows the Russian model , a model proving itself deadly and effective in Ukraine .\nUnderwriting all of these capabilities is China \u2019 s massive industrial base .\nWestern experts including those at the Royal United Services Institute ( RUSI ) in a paper titled , \u201c The Return of Industrial Warfare , \u201d would note that the West has fallen behind Russia in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because behind the Russian invasion stands the world \u2019 s manufacturing capital \u2013 China .\nAs the US begins to expend more and more of its stockpiles to keep Ukraine in the war , China has yet to provide any meaningful military assistance to Russia .\nThe West must assume that China will not allow Russia to be defeated , especially due to a lack of ammunition .\nIf competition between autocracies and democracies has really entered a military phase , then the arsenal of democracy must first radically improve its approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it is true that the West lags behind Russia in terms of its military industrial production , it is many times more true in regards to China .\nWhile the RUSI paper admits this is a problem the West must rectify , it is unlikely able to .\nWhatever steps the West takes to improve its military industrial capacity , both Russia and China will not only match such steps but ensure they remain far ahead of them .\nEven should US capabilities match those of China , the fact that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world particularly in regards to Taiwan puts it at a disadvantage logistically .\nIt is a fight the US holds multiple disadvantages in and a fight the US should not be picking in the first place .\nChina has carefully for decades cultivated its military capabilities to defend China from foreign aggression , subjugation , and the humiliation associated with it , all of which the Chinese people have suffered at the hands of Western powers in the past .\nWith the US military itself admitting Chinese military capabilities are in some ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other areas surpassing them , the notion of the US using military force with impunity in or around Chinese territory has significantly diminished .\nIn fact , the desperate , reckless urgency that has taken hold of Washington in recent years in regards to China and Washington \u2019 s growing inability to \u201c contain \u201d it is at the center of US provocations like Pelosi \u2019 s recent visit to Taiwan .\nIt will now be a matter of Beijing managing additional and increasingly desperate provocations by the US against China to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially destructive conflict with the United States .\nThe most logical decision Washington could make is to adopt a multipolar mindset allowing it to peacefully coexist alongside China and other nations rather than its current continued attempts to assert itself above all other nations .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on Instagram

amusing .\nThere he was , the still fresh Labor Prime Minister , Anthony Albanese , rendered pygmy-like by the enormity of one Shaquille O \u2019 Neal , popularly known as Shaq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this press conference could conceal the disparity in size between the two .\nAlbanese has made it his crowning ambition to campaign for the Voice .\nBy that , he means to put to Australian voters a question on constitutionally recognising Australia \u2019 s First Nations peoples ( admirable and irrefutable ) and enshrining a vague , as yet undetermined political forum that will represent them ( problematic ) .\nHe hopes to get popular consent to alter the Constitution first without necessarily putting a model to the vote , a distinctly brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingering in the bushes , but the appearance of Shaq provided grist to the mill .\nWhile movie stars , tartlets and personalities find their mark in the politics of some countries ( the Philippines comes to mind ) , Australia remains unaroused by the tinsel and bling .\nGenerally speaking , the celebrity factor duds when it comes to proposing substantive political change .\nAs much as Australians love their sports stars and , less significantly , their film stars , using them to promote an agenda that might result in votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined with finger pointing moral authority , the voter in question is bound to switch off and drop out .\nThis did not cross Albanese \u2019 s mind .\n\u201c Shaq is someone who is well known to younger people , and one of things that we have been doing is trying to mobilise support for the Voice to Parliament by talking with sporting figures.\n\u201d The antics of the Albanese-O \u2019 Neal show , however innocently done , served to emphasise political distance , not collective worth .\nIt suggested a deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refined behind closed doors away from the curious mob .\n\u201c [ I ] f there is anything you need from me , let me know , \u201d Shaq offered the Australian prime minister before the cameras .\nThis might well work for a certain demographic of green salad voter but unlikely to interest the pragmatically suspicious sort .\nThe event did not even feature anything profound from the titanic figure .\nThe focus was all about having him there .\n\u201c We know that Mr O \u2019 Neal does a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice and lifting people up who are marginalised , including through sporting organisations , \u201d stated Albanese .\nThis is undoubtedly true as a statement , but the inference here is that local Australians involved in such projects simply don \u2019 t cut the mustard or , if they do , need something of a hand up .\nMarvellous it may be that \u201c Shaq has that record \u201d and realises \u201c that Australian history didn \u2019 t begin in 1788 \u201d , such celebrities can hardly be seen as high authorities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as nosey meddlers .\nThe waft of condescension did not take long to find a number of keen and irate noses .\n\u201c Anybody else uncomfortable that our PM needs to hall [ sic ] in an American basketball star to shill for the Voice ?\n\u201d wondered the cranky former Senator Derry Hynch .\nAlways happy to screech his agreement with the next contrarian spark , Barnaby Joyce MP of the Nationals also claimed that O \u2019 Neal had few , if any credentials , to talk about such matters .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball star\u2026 over here to talk about how we run our Constitution ?\n\u201d Presumably , the cynic might retort , because you don \u2019 t run it , the true locus of power lying with her Britannic majesty , Queen Elizabeth II , exercised via her representative , the Governor General .\nThe rest is left to the discretion of US power .\nAll is fair and mockery when you are a monarchical outpost and Washington \u2019 s bit of rough .\nHarder to dispel was the question from Joyce as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are we selling McDonald \u2019 s here or are we changing the Constitution ?\n\u201d It had to also come to a matter of size \u2013 or height .\n\u201c Why have you got an American basketball star standing at the podium about 10 feet taller than Anthony Albanese , I mean what \u2019 s this about ?\n\u201d Had the grunts and grumbles remained confined to a few conservatives of pallid disposition , nothing more would have been said .\nAlbanese , for his part , could only see the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think people should chill out a bit basically.\n\u201d The star \u2019 s appearance meant conversation about the Voice , \u201c and that \u2019 s a good thing.\n\u201d But certain First Nations politicians refused to chill .\nVictorian Senator Lidia Thorpe preferred boiling , launching her own salvo of dissatisfaction from the perspective of the First Nations who were seemingly placed in a runner-up position relative to a US sporting star .\n\u201c Labor met with an American celebrity before speaking with First Nations politicians from this Country .\nNot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss the Voice .\nStill waiting , Labor.\n\u201d In an interview with Melbourne radio station 3AW , she kept the fusillades coming .\n\u201c He \u2019 s putting his nose into business that has nothing to do with him.\n\u201d Shaq , she suggested , did \u201c not understand what is going on in this country and he should not be commenting \u201d .\nThorpe continued to note that the basketball figure was \u201c here for a speaking tour , good on him \u201d while also promoting PointsBet \u201c which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Of different political persuasion but also of First Nations sensibility , Country Liberal Party Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price found herself in furious agreement , a rare sight indeed .\n\u201c If the PM and the Minister for Indigenous Australians thinks Shaq \u2019 s experience with \u2018 lifting people up who are marginalised \u2019 is the answer to winning Yes votes for the Voice then it demonstrates just how clueless and out of touch they both are with what the needs of Aboriginal Australians are.\n\u201d From this , an echo of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1999 can be discerned .\nThen , the papers , media outlets , pundits and lobbyists thought the Australian Republic in the bag .\nIn the final referendum outcome , it barely fitted .\nA key , and failed figure then , was Malcolm Turnbull of the Australian Republican Movement .\nIn his company were the authorial-thespian-professional class who thought victory a foregone conclusion .\nThe Constitutional Monarchists , and the devious conservative Prime Minister at the time , John Howard , thought otherwise .\nSince then , Turnbull entered parliament , became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s malice , but not before arguing against the Voice .\nThe fact that he is now in favour of it should worry Albanese , given his past misreading of the Australian mood .\nDown under , celebrity figures , actual and pretend , can kill worthwhile political causes .\nNote to readers : Please

the election of a new government in Australia in May , the begging bowls were being readied by administrators in the university sector .\nBloated , ungainly , ruthless and uneven in quality , the country \u2019 s universities , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case for more public funding harder .\nInitially ravaged by poor investment decisions , notably in the Chinese market , COVID-19 had threatened to wipe the balance sheets of a good number of Australia \u2019 s academic institutions .\nDespite initial shocks , the storm has been , apart from a few institutions , weathered .\nThe University of Sydney registered a A $ 1.04 billion operating surplus between 2020 and 2021 , with an underlying surplus of A $ 454 million .\nThe University of New South Wales ( UNSW ) reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2021 , a considerable improvement from its A $ 19 million loss in 2020 .\nThe University of Technology Sydney recorded revenue amounting to A $ 109 million , shading their $ 50 million loss from 2020 into oblivion .\nSuch surpluses would surely suggest the viability of pay rises for staff , an important point in pay negotiations with stingy university managements .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no excuse for university management to be hoarding money in such proportions , \u201d reasons the National Tertiary Education Union branch president Nick Riemer .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for much-needed reforms .\nThis shows they are affordable.\n\u201d NTEU New South Wales Secretary Damien Cahill has also added his view that a number of universities , notably University of Sydney , \u201c can afford a fair pay rise for staff and to fix the problem of widespread job insecurity.\n\u201d The response from the non-teaching , non-research blotter jotters was characteristic .\nSuch ballooning amounts were seen as unusual , one-off cases , arrows out of the blue .\nAround the corner , revenue stripping disasters await .\nThe pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nUniversity of Sydney \u2019 s Vice Chancellor Mark Scott led the pack with that ill-worn argument .\n\u201c While this is a strong result , it is also a one-off result , \u201d he claimed in a statement .\n\u201c We are not immune from the continuing uncertain future of international higher education and the growing cost pressures currently affecting the global and Australian economies.\n\u201d The University \u2019 s own annual report notes how the surplus came about \u201c mainly due to increases in overseas student enrolments , strong investment performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s A $ 95.1 million Research Support Program contribution and the net gains from the disposal of property assets.\n\u201d The picture is one of corporate brands raking in cash rather than educators providing a public service .\nSome 38 of Australia \u2019 s universities , for instance , drew revenue from selling their shareholdings in IDP Education , considered one of the world \u2019 s largest international education companies .\nPrior to the sale , Australian universities held a 40 % stake in IDP Education , retained via Education Australia .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , job losses have been unremitting .\nThousands of staff have been given the big heave-ho and sod off treatment even as managers have continued feathering their nests .\n( All in all , 3,237 fewer permanent and fixed-term contract staff positions were noted in the latest federal government figures . )\nThe University of NSW topped the league tables in that regard , with 726 fewer full-time equivalent positions in 2021 than the previous year .\nThe University of Sydney shed 223 staff despite recording its best surplus in 172 years .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ by A $ 60 million .\nTo these job losses can be added those suffered by the invaluable , long suffering casual workforce .\nIn a shameful state of affairs , this precarious body of workers , with minimal labour protections and economic security , constitute the vast bulk of those delivering courses .\nPrior to the pandemic , the number of casual employees working in Australia \u2019 s universities is estimated to have been in the order of 100,000 .\nLosses of 4,258 full-time equivalents in 2020 were registered , but other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inequity basks that species of lamentable administrator known as the Vice Chancellor .\nThe Australian variants of this office have persistently proven to be untrustworthy and unworthy .\nFor years , their obscene pay packages , their decisions to reduce able staff while still maintaining their own inflated salaries and the tribunate that surrounds them , deserved an anti-corruption inquiry .\nThe scope of such an inquiry would have to be oceanic and vast , from teasing out the grounds for ludicrous investment choices to rules stifling free speech and academic freedoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort to non-disclosure agreements , the use of codes of conduct as silencing bludgeons , and the almost total absence of solid anti-whistleblower provisions , could be looked at .\nInstead of being interrogated by appropriate QCs and chased up with a sharp summons , these managers only grow in number , the mold of administrative disaster , undermining academic health at every turn and creating the next absurd brand they call a \u201c university \u201d .\nWith each semester , new positions are created with names disturbingly reminiscent of industrial cleaning products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what not .\nThese fatuous appointments are subsidised , in turn , by the labours of ailing , overworked staff , contemplating ruination , dejection , and suicide .\nThe education system has been in sharp decline in inverse proportion to the financial returns being hailed .\nThrowing public money at these beggars in surplus , an otherwise sensible proposition that could shield the sector from the ravages of impudent investment decisions , looks less appealing on closer inspection .\nWithout deep , remorselessly brave reform , one that directly decapitates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be thrown after ill-gotten gains .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on Instagram and Twitter and subscribe to our Telegram Channel .\nFeel free to repost and share widely

nuclear power plant construction before the manufacturing expertise that makes it possible is lost .\nIf the decision is ultimately taken , it would mark a fundamental shift in the policy to reduce Japan \u2019 s dependence on nuclear power that has prevailed since the Fukushima disaster in 2011 .\nSpeaking to the Ministry of Economy , Trade and Industry \u2019 s ( METI ) Green Transformation

.\nLooking at foreign policy , the question is whether there has been continuity or change from the policies of prior governments .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will rightly say there has been great continuity on international policy with no revolutionary change in direction .\nAs Minister for Foreign Affairs Penny Wong recently said , I have made clear that our national interests , our strategic policy settings haven \u2019 t changed \u2013 but obviously the government has , and how the government approaches engaging with the world and articulating those interests has changed .\nSo where can we see this change ?\nThe first change is in the simple volume of international engagement .\nThe day after he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Quad Leaders \u2019 Summit , quickly followed by his first bilateral visit to Indonesia .\nWong has made four separate trips to the Pacific ( Fiji , Samoa and Tonga , New Zealand and Solomon Islands , as well as July \u2019 s Pacific Islands Forum Summit ) and three to Southeast Asia ( Vietnam and Malaysia , Singapore and Indonesia twice ) .\nMinister for Defence Richard Marles has visited Singapore , India , the United States and the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Rwanda .\nAnd Minister for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the WTO Ministerial Conference and bilateral meetings .\nSome of this activity is due to the fortuitous timing of international meetings , but the rest is a conscious choice to prioritise international engagement .\nIt suggests a certain amount of pent-up energy among new ministers with much on their agendas after so long in opposition .\nThe overall impression is of a government focused on international matters , which has perhaps adopted the mindset that external policy is as important as domestic policy .\nAlbanese defended his trip to the NATO summit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t separate international events from their impact on Australia and Australians .\nThe second change is a reset in some key relationships .\nEvery new government should use the opportunity to get rid of barnacles that have attached themselves to the ship of state .\nThis was most notable in the reset in relations with France , still seething from the cancellation of its submarine construction deal in favour of AUKUS , the trilateral security pact between Australia , the United Kingdom , and the United States .\nThe diplomatic freeze with China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defence meeting at the Shangri-La Dialogue and the ministers for foreign affairs meeting soon after .\nThis was presented as \u201c stabilising the relationship \u201d , with the government stressing that there has been no change in policy position .\nChanges in climate , Pacific and South-East Asia Third , there has been a substantive policy change on climate action .\nThis has had an impact on Australia \u2019 s international relations , particularly in the Pacific , where there had been no secret about Pacific leaders \u2019 disappointment in Australia \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days after being sworn in , Wong spoke to the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat to herald \u201c a new era in Australian engagement in the Pacific \u201d based on standing \u201c shoulder to shoulder with our Pacific family \u201d in response to the climate crisis .\nPacific leaders including the prime ministers of Samoa and Tonga welcomed this policy shift .\nWhile it won \u2019 t all be plain sailing ahead \u2013 with Australia likely to continue to face pressure around the speed of its transition away from fossil fuels \u2013 relations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a change in tone on some issues .\nFor example , in South-east Asia former Prime Minister Morrison \u2019 s framing around an \u201c arc of autocracies \u201d was viewed as proposing a binary choice between democratic and authoritarian blocs .\nThe Albanese government \u2019 s messaging emphasises \u201c strategic equilibrium \u201d where \u201c countries are not forced to choose but can make their own sovereign choices , including about their alignments and partnerships \u201d .\nFinally , the government is beginning the hard work of increasing Australia \u2019 s international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has announced a Defence Strategic Review and is updating its International Development Policy .\nThe government has also committed to building the capability of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade after decades of declining funding .\nAllan Gyngell , National President of the Australian Institute of International Affairs ( AIIA ) , sees this as a significant change : \u201c After years of marginalisation , foreign policy has been restored to a more central part of Australian statecraft.\n\u201d Overall , after the flurry of early visits , the Albanese government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for the long-term .\nLooking back on nine years of the previous government \u2013 with three prime ministers creating a sense of constant campaign mode \u2013 domestic politics often seemed to dominate

the tactless expression , or the inability to do things with subtle reflection ?\nOn September 6 , Australian diplomacy gave another display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wong \u2019 s remarks about the Solomon Islands elections .\nThings have been testy for the government of Manasseh Sogavare , who has rolled out the red carpet to pestiferous officials of virtually all ranks from Beijing to Washington .\nMost , if not all this interest , has been triggered by Sogavare \u2019 s signing of a security pact with the People \u2019 s Republic of China .\nThis , the government in Honaria duly found out , is not approved by the Anglophone powers on either side of the Pacific .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister Scott Morrison called a potential Chinese naval base a \u201c red line \u201d , while US National Security Council official Kurt Campbell promised that Washington would \u201c respond accordingly \u201d .\nBeing in what is termed the Australian \u201c backyard \u201d by those who so happen to be in Australia , Wong made an offer that would irk any sovereign state , including her own : We , old friends of empire , are happy to bankroll your election .\nThe offer was floated largely because of two factors .\nSogavare is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Games , scheduled to be held in late 2023 .\nThe Constitutional Amendment Bill 2022 placed before parliament will enable him to postpone the election to 2024 .\nThe unconvincing argument made by the government is that forking out the cash for both the Games and the election in the same year would be prohibitively costly .\nInstead of leaving this messy situation to Honiara to scrap it out with its detractors and opponents , Wong decided to open the wallet .\nThe Australian taxpayer , never asked in such matters , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were they to be held next year .\n\u201c We have made an offer of assistance , and it \u2019 s a matter for Solomon Islands as to whether they respond and how they wish to respond , \u201d she explained to RN Breakfast .\nWhen asked whether this seemed to be a soothing response to the grievances of opposition politicians in the Solomon Islands , Wong could only be derivative .\n\u201c No , this is because Australia has historically supported democracy in Solomon Islands.\n\u201d Australia had \u201c previously offered support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the bitter , condescending tenure of the Morrison government , which saw South Pacific states mocked for their climate change concerns , Canberra \u2019 s perceived paternalism is not welcome .\nThe statement that thundered Canberra \u2019 s way was one of stern disapproval .\n\u201c The timing of the public media announcement by the Australian government is in effect a strategy to influence how Members of Parliament will vote on this Bill during the second reading on Thursday 8th September 2022.\n\u201d Using words that should appeal to Australia \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to claim that this was \u201c an assault on our parliamentary democracy and is a direct foreign interference into our domestic affairs.\n\u201d Opposition MPs in Honiara have eagerly jumped at the promise of Wong \u2019 s statement .\nUsing Australian assistance as a political means to weaken the government has played to a conventional stereotype : find the wealthy patron , and use that patron wisely .\nAustralia \u2019 s offer , claimed MP Peter Kenilorea Jr of the Parliamentary Foreign Relations Committee , was \u201c generous \u201d rather than one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s part was \u201c unfortunate and extremely unhelpful .\nIt has exposed Sogavare and his government \u2019 s \u2026 selfish agenda to hold on to power.\n\u201d Opposition leader Matthew Wale is also of the view that Sogavare is desperate to entrench himself , using the amendment measure as a distraction .\n\u201c If we respect the people \u2019 s mandate and parliamentary democracy and processes , MPs should reject the Bill to postpone elections .\nWith Australian funding , there is now no need for the bill.\n\u201d The likes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sogavare had happily received cash from Canberra regarding funding for the Pacific Games itself .\n\u201c When Australia gave A $ 17 for the Pacific Games it was heartily welcomed with smiles .\nBut when an offer is made to support timely elections , it is seen differently.\n\u201d Perhaps it says much that MP Kenilorea sees no distinction between games that are sponsored , in part , by a foreign power , and the election process that returns parliamentary members .\nBack in Australia , Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister , Simon Birmingham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but took issue with the execution .\nThe Albanese government , he remarked on RN Breakfast , should have done things in confidence and on the sly .\nTo have made it public was a \u201c giant misstep \u201d .\nNor was the electoral gambit enough for those voices who wish to see the South Pacific turned into an Anglo-Australian garrison ready to repel the Yellow Horde .\nThe apoplectic demagogues on Rupert Murdoch \u2019 s Sky News network rage that more should be done .\nThe blustery Andrew Bolt told his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shown \u201c weakness \u201d in not trouncing the independent will of island savages and their drift towards the bosom of totalitarianism .\n\u201c It still refuses to say a word of criticism as the Solomon Islands , this island nation right on our border , as its leader pushes from democracy towards something looking increasingly like the Cuba of the Pacific.\n\u201d The only country risking the status of a \u201c Cuba of the Pacific \u201d , in so far as political isolation is concerned , is Australia .\n\u201c Australia \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d writes former Singaporean diplomat Kishore Mahbubani \u201c is simple : it can choose to be a bridge between East and the West in the Asian Century \u2013 or the tip of the spear projecting Western power into Asia.\n\u201d In choosing to be a spear of Western interference

Asia-Pacific ?\n\u201d The speech was largely structured as a serious message to the collective west , as well as to what top analyst Sergey Karaganov calls the \u201c global majority.\n\u201d Among several takeaways , these may be the most relevant : \u2022 Russia as a sovereign state will defend its interests .\n\u2022 Western sanctions \u2018 fever \u2019 is threatening the world \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the pandemic .\n\u2022 The entire system of international relations has changed .\nThere is an attempt to maintain world order by changing the rules .\n\u2022 Sanctions on Russia are closing down businesses in Europe .\nRussia is coping with economic and tech aggression from the west .\n\u2022 Inflation is breaking records in developed countries .\nRussia is looking at around 12 percent .\n\u2022 Russia has played its part in grain exports leaving Ukraine , but most shipments went to EU nations and not developing countries .\n\u2022 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 is being ignored.\n\u201d \u2022 The west is in no position to dictate energy prices to Russia .\n\u2022 Ruble and yuan will be used for gas payments .\n\u2022 The role of Asia-Pacific has significantly increased .\nIn a nutshell : Asia is the new epicenter of technological progress and productivity .\nNo more an \u2018 object of colonization \u2019 Taking place only two weeks before another essential annual gathering \u2013 the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SCO ) summit in Samarkand \u2013 it is no wonder some of the top discussions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic interpolation between the SCO and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) .\nThis theme is as crucial as the development of the Russian Arctic : at 41 percent of total territory , that \u2019 s the largest resource base in the federation , spread out over nine regions , and encompassing the largest Special Economic Zone ( SEZ ) on the planet , linked to the free port of Vladivostok .\nThe Arctic is being developed via several strategically important projects processing mineral , energy , water and biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly fitting that Austria \u2019 s former foreign minister Karin Kneissel , self-described as \u201c a passionate historian , \u201d quipped about her fascination at how Russia and its Asian partners are tackling the development of the Northern Sea Route : \u201c One of my favorite expressions is that airlines and pipelines are moving east .\nAnd I keep saying this for twenty years.\n\u201d Amidst a wealth of roundtables exploring everything from the power of territory , supply chains and global education to \u201c the three whales \u201d ( science , nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion this Tuesday at the forum was centered on the role of the SCO .\nApart from the current full members \u2013 Russia , China , India , Pakistan , four Central Asians ( Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan , Tajikistan , Kyrgyzstan ) , plus the recent accession of Iran \u2013 no less than 11 further nations want to join , from observer Afghanistan to dialogue partner Turkey .\nGrigory Logvinov , the SCO \u2019 s deputy secretary general , stressed how the economic , political and scientific potential of players comprising \u201c the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a quarter of the world \u2019 s GDP , 50 percent of the world \u2019 s population \u2013 has not been fully harvested yet .\nKirill Barsky , from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations , explained how the SCO is actually the model of multipolarity , according to its charter , compared to the backdrop of \u201c destructive processes \u201d launched by the west .\nAnd that leads to the economic agenda in the Eurasian integration progress , with the Russian-led Eurasia Economic Union ( EAEU ) configured as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barsky identifies the SCO as \u201c the core Eurasian structure , forming the agenda of Greater Eurasia within a network of partnership organizations.\n\u201d That \u2019 s where the importance of the cooperation with ASEAN comes in .\nBarsky could not but evoke Mackinder , Spykman and Brzezinski \u2013 who regarded Eurasia \u201c as an object to be acted upon the wishes of western states , confined within the continent , away from the ocean shores , so the western world could dominate in a global confrontation of land and sea .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these negative concepts.\n\u201d And here we hit a notion widely shared from Tehran to Vladivostok : Eurasia no longer as \u201c an object of colonization by \u2018 civilized Europe \u2019 but again an agent of global policy.\n\u201d Sun Zuangnzhi from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences ( CASS ) elaborated on China \u2019 s interest in the SCO .\nHe focused on achievements : In the 21 years since its founding , a mechanism to establish security between China , Russia and Central Asian states evolved into \u201c multi-tiered , multi-sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a political instrument , \u201d the SCO should capitalize on its role of dialogue forum for states with a difficult history of conflicts \u2013 \u201c interactions are sometimes difficult \u201d \u2013 and focus on economic cooperation \u201c on health , energy , food security , reduction of poverty.\n\u201d Rashid Alimov , a former SCO secretary general , now a professor at the Taihe Institute , stressed the \u201c high expectations \u201d from Central Asian nations , the core of the organization .\nThe original idea remains \u2013 based on the indivisibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eurasia .\nWell , we all know how the US and NATO reacted when Russia late last year proposed a serious dialogue on \u201c indivisibility of security.\n\u201d As Central Asia does not have an outlet to the sea , it is inevitable , as Alimov stressed , that Uzbekistan \u2019 s foreign policy privileges involvement in accelerated intra-SCO trade .\nRussia and China may be the leading investors , and now \u201c Iran also plays an important role .\nOver 1,200 Iranian companies are working in Central Asia.\n\u201d Connectivity , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Bank rates Central Asia as one of the least connected economies in the world.\n\u201d Sergey Storchak of Russian bank VEB explained the workings of the \u201c SCO interbank consortium.\n\u201d Partners have used \u201c a credit line from the Bank of China \u201d and want to sign a deal with Uzbekistan .\nThe SCO interbank consortium will be led by the Indians on a rotation basis \u2013 and they want to step up its game .\nAt the upcoming summit in Samarkand , Storchak expects a road map for the transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional trade .\nKumar Rajan from the School of International Studies of the Jawaharlal Nehru University articulated the Indian position .\nHe went straight to the point : \u201c India wants a 21st Asian century .\nClose cooperation between India and China is necessary .\nThey can make the Asian century happen.\n\u201d Rajan remarked how India does not see the SCO as an alliance , but committed to the development and political stability of Eurasia .\nHe made the crucial point about connectivity revolving around India \u201c working with Russia and Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International North South Transportation Corridor , and one of its key hubs , the Chabahar port in Iran : \u201c India does not have direct physical connectivity with Central Asia .\nThe INSTC has the participation of an Iranian shipping line with 300 vessels , connecting to Mumbai .\nPresident Putin , in the [ recent ] Caspian meeting , referred directly to the INSTC.\n\u201d Crucially , India not only supports the Russian concept of Greater Eurasia Partnership but is engaged in setting up a free trade agreement with the EAEU : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the Vladivostok forum last year .\nIn all of the above nuanced interventions , some themes are constant .\nAfter the Afghanistan disaster and the end of the US occupation there , the stabilizing role of the SCO can not be overstated enough .\nAn ambitious road map for cooperation is a must \u2013 probably to be approved at the Samarkand summit .\nAll players will be gradually changing to trade in bilateral currencies .\nAnd creation of transit corridors is leading to the progressive integration of national transit systems .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the \u2018 Gateway to a Multipolar World \u2019 expanded on the SCO role , outlining how most Asian nations are \u201c friendly \u201d or \u201c benevolently neutral \u201d when it comes to Russia after the start of the Special Military Operation ( SMO ) in Ukraine .\nSo the possibilities for expanding cooperation across Eurasia remain practically unlimited .\nComplementarity of economies is the main factor .\nThat would lead , among other developments , to the Russian Far East , as a multipolar hub , turning into \u201c Russia \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWang Wen from the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies stressed the need for Russia to rediscover China \u2013 finding \u201c mutual trust in the middle level and elites level \u201d .\nAt the same time , there \u2019 s a sort of global rush to join BRICS , from Saudi Arabia and Iran to Afghanistan and Argentina : \u201c That means a new civilization model for emerging economies like China and Argentina because they want to rise up peacefully ( \u2026 ) I think we are in the new civilization age.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institution of India got back to Spykman pigeonholing the nation as a rimland state .\nNot anymore : India now has multiple strategies , from connecting to Central Asia to the \u2018 Act East \u2019 policy .\nOverall , it \u2019 s an outreach to Eurasia , as India \u201c is not competitive and needs to diversify to get better access to Eurasia , with logistical help from Russia.\n\u201c Sharma stresses how India takes SCO , BRICS and RICs very seriously while seeing Russia playing \u201c an important role in the Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : India does not want Quad as a military alliance , privileging instead \u201c interdependence and complementarity between India , Russia and China.\n\u201d All of these discussions interconnect with the two overarching themes in several Vladivostok roundtables : energy and the development of the Arctic \u2019 s natural resources .\nPavel Sorokin , Russian First Deputy Minister of Energy , dismissed the notion of a storm or typhoon in the energy markets : \u201c It \u2019 s a far cry from a natural process .\nIt \u2019 s a man-made situation.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seen by most analysts as slowly but surely designing its Arctic/Asian cooperation future \u2013 including , for instance , the creation of a sophisticated trans-shipment infrastructure for Liquified Natural Gas ( LNG ) .\nEnergy Minister Nikolay Shulginov made sure that Russia will actually increase its gas production , considering the rise of LNG deliveries and the construction of Power of Siberia-2 to China : \u201c We will not merely scale up the pipeline capacity but we will also expand LNG production : it has mobility and excellent purchases on the global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the emphasis is on building a powerful , modern icebreaker fleet \u2013 including nuclear .\nGadzhimagomed Guseynov , First Deputy Minister for the Development of the Far East and the Arctic , is adamant : \u201c What Russia has to do is to make the Northern Sea Route a sustainable and important transit route.\n\u201d There is a long-term plan up to 2035 to create infrastructure for safe shipping navigation , following an \u2018 Arctic best practices \u2019 of learning step by step .\nNOVATEK , according to its deputy chairman Evgeniy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a revolution in terms of Arctic navigation and shipbuilding in the last few years .\nKniessel , the former Austrian minister , recalled that she always missed the larger geopolitical picture in her discussions when she was active in European politics ( she now lives in Lebanon ) : \u201c I wrote about the passing of the torch from Atlanticism to the Pacific .\nAirlines , pipelines and waterways are moving East .\nThe Far East is actually Pacific Russia.\n\u201d Whatever Atlanticists may think of it , the last word for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the board of directors of Gazprom : Russia is ready for winter .\nThere will be warmth and light everywhere.\n\u201d Note to

free to repost and share widely Global Research articles .\nThe Ministry of External Affairs has done the right thing by explaining its taciturn press release on Thursday in a single sentence regarding the disengagement of troops in the area of Gogra-Hotsprings along the LAC in the Western Sector of India-China border areas .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more details .\nBroadly , a consensus reached at the 16th round of India-China Corps Commander Level Meeting on 17 July has since been fleshed out by the two sides , and the actual disengagement commenced on Thursday which will be completed on coming Monday .\nThe following key elements draw attention : \u2022 Both sides will \u201c cease forward deployments in this area in a phased , coordinated and verified manner , resulting in the return of the troops of both sides to their respective areas.\n\u201d \u2022 All temporary structures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by both sides \u201c will be dismantled and mutually verified.\n\u201d \u2022 \u201c The landforms in the area will be restored to pre-stand-off period by both sides.\n\u201d \u2022 \u201c The agreement ensures that the LAC in this area will be strictly observed and respected by both sides , and that there will be no unilateral change in status quo.\n\u201d \u2022 Going forward , the sides will \u201c take the talks forward and resolve the remaining issues along LAC and restore peace and tranquility in India-China border areas.\n\u201d The last two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status quo \u201d and the commitment to resolve the remaining issues \u2014 are , quite obviously , inter-related .\nSimply put , there will be no attempts by either side to indulge in any \u201c Mission Creep \u201d to seize unilateral advantage of territory .\nThis is hugely important , given the two vastly divergent narratives on what precipitated the standoff two years ago .\nHow the \u201c status quo \u201d is to be understood is not yet in the public domain , but presumably , it is to mutual satisfaction .\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both sides ) has made this agreement possible .\nExternal Affairs Minister S Jaishankar pointedly reminded the domestic public opinion about this on September 4 even as the announcement on the disengagement four days later was being drafted jointly with China .\nOnly four days prior to that , on August 30 , when Jaishankar said much of Asia \u2019 s future depends on how the ties between the two countries develop in the foreseeable future , and for the ties to return to a positive trajectory , they must be based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual interest , he was clearly addressing China .\nUnfortunately , some Indian commentators have rushed to belittle what has unfolded in the recent months by linking it to a possible meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping next week at Samarkand .\nThat said , if there is going to be a meeting at Samarkand , this disengagement indeed provides the setting for constructive discussion .\nBoth governments have high stakes in maintaining peace and tranquility along the LAC in the present hugely transformative period in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war and peace in the Taiwan Straits are a top priority .\nAs for India , a crucial period of adjustment to new geopolitical conditions lies ahead which presents daunting challenges to its strategic autonomy and independent foreign policies , stemming from the West \u2019 s attempts to polarise the world community against Russia and China .\nBoth India and China sense the high importance of pursuing their respective trajectories of economic growth and development optimally in a difficult and unfavourable climate internationally .\nSpeaking of India , our analysts prefer \u2014 either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sidestep the co-relation between a peaceful and tranquil border and the country \u2019 s overall economic situation .\nThe Ukraine conflict is adding to global inflation by raising the cost of energy and other raw commodities while an increasingly hawkish US Fed is tightening its policies , and significantly reducing its balance sheet .\nThere could be looming currency and foreign exchange worries .\nTime may have come to build up a clearing system among BRICS countries .\nIndia \u2019 s current foreign exchange reserves are at their lowest since October 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s equity and debt markets have also weighed on the rupee .\nThere is continuing Western interference in India-China relations and the fact that the government has sequestered the bilateral track with China is not going to be to the liking of the West .\nFundamentally , the contradiction is that without India , there is no \u201c Indo-Pacific Strategy \u201d against China .\nIn a recent interview with an Indian newspaper , the former Prime Minister of Australia and an acclaimed hawk on China , Kevin Rudd , posed the question that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What does India do ultimately , if China does unilaterally resolve the border , as Gorbachev did , with the Russian Federation within the Soviet Union in 1989 ?\n\u201d Rudd repeated , \u201c what would India then do in terms of China \u2019 s rise if the border was resolved , and India and China and Russia folded into one enormous market of mutual opportunity ?\n\u201d In such a scenario , Rudd could see only a binary choice for India : it should either \u201c bandwagon \u201d with China or \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terribly disappointed man to see that there could be a Third Way .\nChina is not really expecting anyone to \u201c bandwagon \u201d with it .\nIts DNA is similar to India \u2019 s \u2014 pursuit of national interests while retaining strategic autonomy ( even with regard to its partner Russia . )\nChina takes satisfaction that India treasures its strategic autonomy .\nIts expectation is only that India should not align with the US to pursue hostile policies .\nThat is perfectly understandable , too .\nA consensus with China that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage is the maximum that can be expected today and the irreducible minimum required until such time as the Indian opinion can accept a fair and just settlement of the boundary question in a spirit of compromise .\nNotably , Chinese commentators have appreciated EAM Jaishankar \u2019 s forceful remarks through March-April enunciating India \u2019 s oil purchases from Russia giving primacy to national interests .\nConceivably , such assertion of India \u2019 s strategic autonomy created a favourable ambience in the ongoing talks at various levels with China , leading to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese commentators were appreciative that Jaishankar brought in the tantalising concept of the Asian Century during the Q & A after his speech on \u201c India \u2019 s Vision of the Indo-Pacific \u201d in Thailand on August 16 .\nSignificantly , the Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman reacted to the remark in positive terms three days later on August 19 : \u201c As a Chinese leader put it , \u201c Unless China and India are developed , there will be no Asian century .\nNo genuine Asia-Pacific century or Asian century can come until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are developed.\n\u201d China and India are two ancient civilizations , two major emerging economies and two neighboring countries .\nWe have far more common interests than differences .\nBoth sides have the wisdom and capability to help each other succeed instead of undercutting each other .\nWe hope that the Indian side will work with China to act upon the important common understandings between our leaders , i.e .\n\u201c China and India are not each other \u2019 s threats , but cooperation partners and development opportunities \u201d , bring China-India relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound development at an early date and safeguard the common interests of China , India and our fellow developing countries.\n\u201d China and India have many common interests in the emergent world order .\nOnly three days ago , PM \u2019 s remarks at the Eastern Economic Forum plenary at Vladivostok signalled India \u2019 s interest to work with Russia in the Arctic ( where China is also a participant ) as also in the Northern Sea Route ( where China too is a stakeholder ) .\nBy the way , the Russia-China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a New Era and the Global Sustainable Development ( February 4 , 2022 ) speaks about the two countries \u201c consistently intensifying practical cooperation for the sustainable development of the Arctic \u201d as well as the \u201c development and use of Arctic routes.\n\u201d There is no empirical evidence to show that China has blocked India \u2019 s pathway in the Arctic or the Russian Far East , Southeast Asia , Central Asia or West Asia .\nThe disengagement in Ladakh gives hope that the bilateral relations can be restored , especially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question that India should be vigilant about its defence and national security .\nBut to be paranoid about it or getting entrapped in xenophobic attitudes will be wasteful and ultimately debilitating .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on Instagram and Twitter and subscribe to our Telegram Channel .\nFeel free

spook Asia more than word of trouble in Thailand \u2013 even more so when foreign-exchange reserves are involved .\nIt was Bangkok \u2019 s devaluation in July 1997 that set in motion the Asian financial crisis .\nAs foreign-exchange reserves ran out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no choice but to scrap the US dollar peg and drive the baht sharply lower .\nTwenty-five years later , Southeast Asia \u2019 s second-biggest economy isn \u2019 t quite cascading toward a repeat of that meltdown .\nYet Bangkok is again ground zero of something getting increasing attention in world markets : the speed with which developing Asia \u2019 s central banks are depleting their currency reserves .\nThailand now displays the region \u2019 s biggest drop in reserves as a ratio to gross domestic product ( GDP ) .\nMalaysia is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking , says economist Divya Devesh at Standard Chartered in Singapore , emerging Asian nations , excluding China , are sitting on their smallest piles of reserves since the 2008 Lehman Brothers crisis .\nThe bank \u2019 s focus is on how many months \u2019 worth of imports each economy can finance with today \u2019 s foreign-exchange holdings .\nIn August 2020 , the region averaged about 16 months .\nAt the start of 2022 , it was down to 10 months .\nToday , it \u2019 s in the neighborhood of seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government officials thought Asia might be .\nRaising the stakes , the dollar is rising at the fastest pace versus the Japanese yen in 24 years , up nearly 26 % this year .\nIt \u2019 s up nearly 9.6 % versus the Chinese yuan .\nAs the dollar surges , thanks largely to Federal Reserve rate hikes in Washington , Asian currencies are coming under heavy downward pressure .\nFewer reserves mean less firepower to defend exchange rates .\nThat \u2019 s not to say China isn \u2019 t part of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the psychologically important 7 to the dollar level , the People \u2019 s Bank of China \u201c will be more concerned with slowing the pace of depreciation and keeping expectations stable than defending a specific level for the exchange rate , \u201d says economist Lauren Gloudeman at Eurasia Group .\n\u201c But if depreciation expectations coincide with robust capital outflows or depletion of reserves , its defense may strengthen.\n\u201d Gloudeman points to data out last week showing that \u201c China \u2019 s FX reserves continued to slide to their lowest level in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Institute of International Finance , portfolio outflows persisted for a seventh straight month in August .\nEconomist Carlos Casanova at Union Bancaire Priv\u00e9e observes that the PBOC recently unveiled a cut in reserve requirement ratios for foreign exchange to 6 % , down from 8 % .\nIt was the second RRR cut on foreign exchange in 2022 , following a 100 basis-point reduction in April .\nDuring that period , the yuan depreciated to 6.5 to the dollar from 6.3 .\nThe idea is to boost dollar liquidity and prod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserves into yuan , boosting the Chinese currency .\nBut , Casanova concludes , that \u201c move alone won \u2019 t entirely offset depreciatory pressures .\nThis is a signal that the PBOC is not comfortable with one-way depreciatory expectations , even if they are comfortable with some yuan weakness.\n\u201d The yen \u2019 s drop , though , is shaking up Asia in unpredictable ways .\nThe worry is that China , South Korea or other major economies might feel the need to weaken exchange rates , too , in race-to-the-bottom competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , says economist Brad Setser at the Council on Foreign Relations , indications that either China or Japan are selling large blocks of currency \u201c could be additional pressure on other Asian currencies.\n\u201d Yet now \u2019 s not the time to panic , says economist Louis Kuijs at S & P Global Ratings .\n\u201c Levels of foreign reserves remain generally adequate .\nBut global uncertainty and prospects for still higher global interest rates call for scrutiny of the underlying dynamics.\n\u201d Even so , the politics of the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beijing and elsewhere .\nIn China , says economist Ting Lu at Nomura Holdings , the yuan \u2019 s weakness is hovering over the Communist Party \u2019 s once-in-a-decade leadership reshuffling process \u2013 and at a moment of elevated US-China tensions .\n\u201c Chinese leaders , \u201d Lu says , \u201c especially care about RMB \u2019 s bilateral exchange rate with the dollar because they believe RMB/USD somehow reflects relative economic and political strength .\nSecond , a big depreciation of RMB/USD could dent domestic sentiment and speed up capital flight.\n\u201d Goldman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the PBOC might have tolerance for further yuan depreciation against the dollar , especially as the broad dollar continues to strengthen , though they might want to avoid continued and too fast one-way depreciation if possible.\n\u201d Likewise , economist Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics thinks Beijing will be very careful not to let the yuan weaken past the 7.2 level that \u201c we saw during the trade war.\n\u201d Yet , the dollar \u2019 s gains and the likelihood the US Fed will continue tightening are presenting Chinese officials with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLast week , PBOC deputy governor Liu Guoqiang said that , in the short term , yuan exchange rates should fluctuate in two directions and people \u201c should not bet on a specific point.\n\u201d Liu , however , is clearly focused on the bigger picture in stressing that \u201c in the future , the world \u2019 s recognition of the yuan will continue to increase.\n\u201d Diana Choyleva at Enodo Economics says this tension between the next 20 weeks and the next 20 years is becoming increasingly difficult to pull off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c has largely benefited from the dollar-led global financial ] system .\nBut Beijing now perceives its dependence on the dollar as a strategic vulnerability.\n\u201d On the one hand , Choyleva says , Xi \u2019 s team \u201c wants to guard against the US deploying the dollar as a weapon against it.\n\u201d On the other , she adds , China \u201c wants to use the yuan as a tool for consolidating an economic sphere of influence , thereby bolstering China \u2019 s economic security .\nAnd it wants the yuan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power status , to help bolster its claim to represent a viable alternative to the US-led international order.\n\u201d For now , though , the dollar \u2019 s zigs and zags are dominating Asia \u2019 s 2022 and odds are it will in the year ahead , too .\nHence the focus on Asian foreign-exchange reserve levels as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell \u2019 s team in Washington steps up the pace of tightening .\nHopes US inflation had peaked in July were dashed by news of a 0.1 % increase in consumer prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a year earlier , prices are up 8.3 % .\nLast week , Powell said the Fed will act \u201c forthrightly \u201d to curb overheating risks .\nSome top Fed officials are hinting at another 75 basis-point rate hike next week .\nThe latest data mean \u201c they \u2019 re definitely going 75 \u201d again , says economist Jay Bryson at Wells Fargo & Co. Tiffany Wilding , an economist at Pacific Investment Management Co , says the \u201c scorching \u201d nature of recent price data suggest the problem is \u201c stickier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and means \u201c the Fed has more work to do.\n\u201d So do Asian central banks as local currencies come under increased downward pressure .\nWith average reserves falling \u201c steeply , \u201d says analyst Thomas Rookmaaker at Fitch Ratings , many economies \u201c still have substantial reserve buffers , but for a small number , the fall is an indication of mounting external financing stress.\n\u201d Fitch

free to repost and share widely Global Research articles .\nWhen it was revealed that former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison had not only shown contempt for his own government in secretly appointing himself , via the Governor-General \u2019 s approval , to five portfolios , the depths of deception seemed to be boundless .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spectacular , habitual tendency to conceal matters .\nWhat else would come out ?\nThe latest revelation in the Morrison Mendacity Roadshow came in a leaked document authored by a former Department of Defence deputy secretary , Kim Gillis , a key figure in submarine contract negotiations with the French Naval Group .\nThe contract to build twelve French-made diesel-powered Attack class submarines was spectacularly scuppered by the Morrison government with the announcement last September of the AUKUS security pact .\nA key provision of that agreement between Canberra , Washington and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear-propulsion technology for submarines sourced from either the United Kingdom or the United States .\nFrance was kept in the dark of both the AUKUS negotiations and the fact that their treasured , lucrative submarine contract would cease to exist after September .\nIt ruined , for a time , the relationship between Australia and France , and led President Emmanuel Macron to publicly accuse Morrison of lying .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think , \u201d he memorably responded to a journalist \u2019 s question when asked about the conduct of Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know.\n\u201d Morrison , in a poisonous spirit of retaliation , proceeded to leak the content of private text conversations conducted with the French president .\nThe selective leaking purportedly showed Macron asking a mere two days before the AUKUS announcement whether he should \u201c expect good or bad news for our joint submarines ambitions \u201d .\nAs ever , Australia \u2019 s duplicitous leader was attempting to restore his own tattered credibility by claiming that Macron should have had an inkling that something was rotten in the submarine project .\nThe 10-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explainer to staff , is something of a tell-all about a gross failure of planning and vision .\nHe is understandably defensive about his pet project , insisting , from the outset , that the \u201c cost and schedule blow outs \u201d noted in the media were \u201c wrong and devalues the achievements and the tremendous work by our teams in Australia and France \u201d .\nEstimates , for instance , that the submarine program would cost A $ 50 billion were deemed reasonable at the time , given inflation projects from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 % ) .\nConfusion on this point arose because of 2016 testimony given by Program Manager Rear Admiral Greg Sammut to Senate estimates , whose figure of $ A50 billion was arrived at in constant dollars .\nThis was largely due to the fact that the production schedule had yet to be concretely ascertained , though the first class of submarine was intended to be delivered in 2032 , and the last in the 2050s .\nThe larger sum of A $ 90 billion generated by the Department of Finance in 2017 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of 35 years , was then misrepresented by both parliamentarians and the media as \u201c cost blow out \u201d .\nThis was , Gillis mockingly wrote , nothing more than a \u201c factoid \u201d , \u201c an item of unreliable information that is reported and reported so often that it becomes accepted as fact \u201d .\nDespite scepticism about a nuclear submarine model being retooled and adjusted to conventional parameters , Gillis was all praise for a design that \u201c would be the most advanced lethal conventionally powered submarine ever built.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assisted in the evaluation concluded that the new Attack class would provide capabilities in a range of operational environments that would exceed some of the capabilities of the US nuclear boats.\n\u201d The note also extols the merits of the Australian Defence Department \u2019 s own Project Team .\nThere is almost starstruck admiration for the ability of the Naval Group Australia section ( NGA ) \u201c to develop the company , including all its policies , systems and processes , whilst executing one of the most complex and demanding programs in Australian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , in the mind of this particularly dedicated public servant , that moves were being made to create \u201c a truly sovereign capability to design , build and operate submarines \u201d in Australia .\nWhile Gillis may be straying from hard nosed reality into the realm of streaky hope , he is adamant that the behaviour of the Morrison government in ending the contract without the awareness of those intimately connected with the process was unpardonable .\nSpecial reference is made to the sidelined role of the Commonwealth contract manager , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sammut .\n\u201c I believe it is totally unacceptable when the Commonwealth contract manager is excluded from discussions regarding the termination of the contract for what now appears to be six or more months.\n\u201d Critically , \u201c there was an alternate strategy being developed behind closed doors and outside the accepted contractual processes.\n\u201d On September 15 , 2021 , the day of the AUKUS announcement , the Naval Group Australia Board had received a letter from the Defence Project Office informing them that they \u201c had met the final exit point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the project.\n\u201d There was no inkling on what would happen next .\nHad it been otherwise , no agreements would have been reached to send staff to France the week prior to the \u201c fateful decision \u201d , nor enter into more subcontracts with new Australian companies .\nThe calamitous episode prompted Gillis to come up with his own assessment about bureaucratic machinations .\nWhile not quite in the same league of tormented language as the \u201c known unknowns \u201d of the late former US Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a new argot : \u201c [ T ] he phrase \u2018 I do not think I know \u2019 will now become an integral part of the Australian

democracy and a firm believer that no economy , society , or country can achieve its full potential if women are left behind.\n\u201d The tribute was a classic reminder of how the late Japanese leader could mislead , in this case on the rights of women and the policy of \u201c Womenomics \u201d .\nIn her effusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abe \u2019 s problematic position on Japan \u2019 s use of \u201c comfort women \u201d or sex slaves during the Second World War .\nBefore the Japanese National Assembly , Abe claimed , despite having previously made some tokenistic apology , that , \u201c There was

might be celebrated in some circles , \u201c but his personal vision for rewriting Japanese history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real problem in East Asia \u201d .\nIt was a vision that proved divisive for countries in terms of how they approached Japan , and it also divided Japanese society in terms of its own wartime responsibility .\nOf all those attending the state funeral , the Australians seem the oddest , resembling an Olympic delegation filled with previous and current medal holders .\nThere are no less than four leaders , three former and one current , who have decided to put in an appearance : the Coalition figures John Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Labor prime minister Anthony Albanese .\n\u201c Mr Abe was a remarkable leader , a catalyst for change in Japan and the region , a true friend of Australia , \u201d remarkedAlbanese in a statement .\nTo understand the darker side of Abe requires placing such gushy remarks to one side .\nGranting him a state funeral was itself a contentious point , given its historical associations with imperial power .\nFor prime ministers in the postwar era , there has only been one other : Shigeru Yoshida in 1967 .\nSeveral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the decision to hold a state funeral was reached .\nParliament was not consulted , with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida keeping it a Cabinet matter .\nAs Junichi Miyama of Chuo University put it ,

Okada , who declared that there was no law that could halt state budget implementation via petition .\nThe justice also dismissed the second claim on obligatory mourning .\nIn July , the national

occasion to show how \u201c Japan will not give in to violence \u201d .\nGiven that Abe had already received a more private funeral where his family , friends and admirers could pay tribute , the entire occasion reeks of self-interest ; the dead , after all , can offer no protest at being used .\nThe decision has stirred a rash of demonstrations , even encouraging an attempt at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these reactions : the note of militarism Abe struck while in office ; his historical stubbornness on the role of Japan during the Second World War , and , perhaps most notably , links to the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification ( the Unification Church ) .\nThe nexus between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Unification Church , a South Korean outfit founded by Reverend Moon Sun-myung and colloquially known as the Moonies , was evident in plain sight .\nAbe \u2019 s personal links stretch back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who aided the sect \u2019 s establishment in Japan .\nWhen Moon paid a visit to Japan in the spring of 1992 , he was initially denied entry by senior intelligence officials on account of having served time in a US prison for tax evasion .\nIt did not take long for the decision to be overturned , with Shin Kanemaru of the LDP intervening on the reverend \u2019 s behalf .\nThe special treatment offered this excommunicated Presbyterian minister was emblematic of the broader approach to religious groups in Japan .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom of religion but supposedly curbs political influence and state support .\nNor is the state permitted to engage

said in a statement to Mongabay .\nSantos plans to appeal the decision and is considering submitting a new environment plan for approval , the company said in its statement .\nIt did not respond @ @ @

a subsidiary of the Singapore-owned Singtel and Australia \u2019 s second largest telecommunications company .\nResponsible for one of Australia \u2019 s largest data breaches , the beleaguered company is facing burning accusations and questions on various fronts .\nIt is also proving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to what has been compromised in the leak .\nFirst , for the claimed story , which has been , at points , vague .\nOn September 22 , the telecommunications company revealed that details of up to 9.8 million customers had been stolen from their database .\nDating back to 2017 , these include names , birthdates , phone numbers , email addresses and , in a number of cases , addresses , passport number or driver \u2019 s licenses .\nFittingly , and perversely , a study from the Australian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one in four Australians had been victims of identity crime or a general misuse of personal information .\nA less than comforting observation from the authors was the remark that such rates were \u201c comparable with the 27 percent reported by respondents to the identity fraud survey conducted in 2012 for the United Kingdom \u2019 s National Fraud Authority \u201d .\nIn the case of Optus , the company claims that the breach arose from a \u201c sophisticated cyberattack \u201d .\nThe view from those outside Optus is somewhat different .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application programming interface ( API ) was linked to an Optus customer database leaving it easily accessible .\nIn basic terms , an API permits the transfer of data .\nLeft naked and vulnerable , users can merrily pry their way into systems they would otherwise not have access to .\nThe almost tearful defence of the breach offered by Optus CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin was decidedly unimpressive , despite some prattling in the press about \u201c a courageous and correct call to get in front of the media in a video call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d .\nDuring a streaky display , she claimed that \u201c we are not the villains \u201d and suggested that the API was not freely exposed .\nBayer Rosmarin , however , is defending a crumbling front , made almost absurdly stark by her unimpressively light burden of responsibilities .\nAmong them , making Australia \u2019 s recently retired tennis star , Ash Barty , the company \u2019 s Chief Inspiration Officer , and Australian Formula One racer Daniel Ricciardo Optus Chief Optimism Officer , have been foremost .\nLess laughable is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security exhibited by a whole spectrum of Australian companies .\nAs Tom Burton from the Australian Financial Review sniffily remarks , \u201c intense lobbying from financial , payment , telco , media and marketing interests \u201d retarded reforms towards \u201c a trusted , secure , reliable and efficient regulatory regime to manage the burgeoning digital economy and the data that fuels it.\n\u201d As a feature of this reluctance , Australian banks muttered and grumbled when asked to confirm bank account holder details linked to the account prior to making payments .\nThose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity breaches have had little by way of remedial recourse .\nAustralians , almost uniquely in the Anglo family of smug self-praise , have no self-standing right to sue for the civil wrong of a breach in privacy .\nThe Australian common law remains perversely stubborn in articulating a clear tort on the subject , and legislators have been less than swift in moving matters into legislation .\nThe Privacy Act 1988 ( Cth ) , given its numerous exemptions for small businesses , employee records , media bodies and political parties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt certainly falls far short of its European cousin many times removed , the General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) .\nIn a 2019 report released by the Department of Home Affairs under Freedom of Information , David Lacey and Roger Wilkins , a former secretary of the Attorney-General \u2019 s Department , found that \u201c overall , the response system [ to data breaches ] is either non-existent or performing poorly from a citizen \u2019 s perspective.\n\u201d The authors \u201c observed significant deficiencies in response standards , formal reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for consumers.\n\u201d The condition was made egregiously worse by Australian legislation mandating the retention of customer data for up to two years , though there is no strict requirement not to keep such data after that period .\nThe Department of Home Affairs states that such a policy ensures \u201c Australia \u2019 s law enforcement and security agencies are lawfully able to access data , subject to strict controls.\n\u201d The Telecommunications Consumer Protections Code , overseen by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , also permits telcos to hold personal data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six years prior to the date the information is requested \u201d .\nThis does not , however , necessitate the retention of passport details , drivers \u2019 licenses and Medicare numbers .\nThe implication of such provisions is unmistakable .\nThey have encouraged companies to engage in a course of conduct that has made security feeble and breaches likely .\nThey have become the shoddy handmaidens of government paranoia .\nEntities such as Optus simply can not be seen to be reliable in responding to such crises .\nThe sombre assessment from digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dire .\n\u201c My third law of IT is that every time there is a data breach , one of the first lines out of the spokesperson \u2019 s mouth is that they take security seriously \u2013 even if they have demonstrably proven they are not.\n\u201d While accepting the obvious point that Optus is not directly responsible for the conduct , she stingingly suggests that \u201c you can \u2019 t complain that something \u2019 s been stolen when you haven \u2019 t locked the front door.\n\u201d The policy implications are vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold data as required under problematic data retention law that has been assailed in the EU ?\n( In September , Germany \u2019 s general data retention law was found by the European Court of Justice to violate EU law . )\nMaking such organisations holders of such information renders them rich targets .\nPenalties have been proposed .\nIn the context of the European Union and California , stiff monetary sanctions apply , a point Home Affairs Minister Clare O \u2019 Neil has noted .\nCurrent fines in the order of A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 440,000 for individuals are risible .\nThere are promises from Optus to fork out to replace compromised documents .\nBut in terms of legislative protections , Australian policy makers continue to look at data protection through a lens fractured and dated .\nNote to readers : Please click the

Jaishankar on the mat as regards the latter \u2019 s remarks questioning the raison d \u2019 etre of the US-Pakistan relationship .\nYet , some national dailies have rushed to eagerly attribute it to the US displeasure over India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine .\nOne daily rather churlishly advised the government , \u201c As Delhi demonstrates \u201c strategic autonomy \u201d to engage with every side \u2014 Quad one week , and Russia and China the next at the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation ( SCO ) in Samarkand \u2014 and work around Western sanctions to buy oil from Russia , and keep friends in all camps , it may have to come to terms that others in world play the same game.\n\u201d In this unseemly hurry to link Ned \u2019 s remarks with India \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the US spokesman was speaking on a special day when the Pakistani Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto was visiting the state department at the invitation of the Secretary of State Antony Blinken \u2014 and on top of it , the two countries were commemorating the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations .\nIndeed , it is another matter that Jaishankar \u2019 s remarks were not only unwarranted \u2014 casting aspersions on the US-Pakistan relationship \u2014 but untimely , and perhaps , even provocative .\nThe only charitable explanation could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politician before an audience of Indian-Americans , with an eye on his \u201c core constituency \u201d in India .\nThe mitigating factor of course is that he has only given back to the Americans in their own coin , who consider it their prerogative to butt into other countries \u2019 external relations with gratuitous comments \u2014 India \u2019 s with Russia , for instance .\nNed Price \u2019 s remarks have all the elements of a policy statement .\nHe said : \u201c We don \u2019 t view our relationship with Pakistan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation to one another .\nThese are both partners of ours with different points of emphasis in each .\nWe look at both as partners , because we do have in many cases shared values .\nWe do have in many cases shared interests .\nAnd the relationship we have with India stands on its own .\nThe relationship we have with Pakistan stands on its own .\nWe also want to do everything we can to see to it that these neighbors have relations with one another that are as constructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u2019 s another point of emphasis.\n\u201d What stands out at the most obvious level is that Price reiterated the US policy in the recent decades since the Cold War ended to \u201c de-hyphenate \u201d Washington \u2019 s relationships with India and Pakistan while also promoting a normal relationship between the two South Asian rivals who are not on talking terms .\nPrice pointed out that the two relationships have \u201c different points of emphasis in each.\n\u201d Interestingly , Price equated India with Pakistan as partner countries with which the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d and \u201c in many cases shared interests.\n\u201d This needs to be understood properly .\nWashington has taken note of Pakistan \u2019 s objection over the prioritisation of India in the US \u2019 regional policies in South Asia in the past .\nThis shift removes a major hurdle in the trajectory of US-Pakistan relationship and is necessitated by a variety of factors following the humiliating defeat that the US suffered in Afghanistan .\nHere , security considerations certainly constitute one key factor .\nThe killing of the al-Qaeda chief Ayman Al-Zawahiri was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan .\nEqually , Afghan situation remains dangerous and the US can not turn its back on what \u2019 s happening out there .\nThe US \u2019 dependence on Pakistani intelligence has only increased .\nBoth Jaishankar and our media have been off the mark in judging that the F-16 fighters are of no use in counter-terrorist operations .\nActually , F-16 fighter jets have been for decades the work horses of Turkish military \u2019 s operations against Kurdish terrorist groups .\nThis is despite Turkey manufacturing advanced drones .\nThe real question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan is willing to do what Turkey does routinely in its neighbouring countries by sending the F-16 to bomb the terrorist bases .\nPrice also pointed out that the military balance in the South Asian region has not been affected due to the upgrade of the F-16 jets in the Pakistani inventory .\nTo my mind , it is not for India to opinionate on what Pakistan \u2019 s defence requirements ought to be .\nDo we allow Pakistan to have a say in the modernisation of our armed forces ?\nThis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt is none of India \u2019 s business to question the quotient of mutual benefit in the US-Pakistan relationship .\nIt is a relationship that began a very long time ago , and it served the vital interests of the two countries .\nRemember how Kissinger took off from Pakistan on his pathbreaking visit to China .\nFor a year before that , the Nixon administration and China sent messages back and forth via Pakistan .\nSuffice to say , in one of the most poignant chapters of Cold War history where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviets conclusively , it was Pakistan that the US would count on as its indispensable ally .\nThe revival of the US-Pakistani alliance should not annoy India .\nThere is an inevitability about it , if the overthrow of Imran Khan and the regime change that followed in Pakistan is to be taken to its logical conclusion .\nThe lovefest yesterday at the National Museum of American Diplomacy in the Harry S Truman Building in Washington was truly befitting .\nBilawal Bhutto put it nicely when he said , \u201c diplomacy is back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( applause ) \u2013 and in the foreign ministry of Pakistan.\n\u201d Price \u2019 s remarks should be a reality check for those media analysts who wish that if only India rolls back its relationship with Russia and aligns with the US , goodies would follow .\nLife is real .\nAsk Turkey or Saudi Arabia and the UAE and Egypt what their experience has been as the allies of the US .\nIt is sheer na\u00efvet\u00e9 to imagine that the US \u2019 normalisation with Pakistan is simply a way of punishing India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctions against Russia .\nMake no mistake , the revival of the US \u2019 partnership with Pakistan is a long-term strategy necessitated by profound geopolitical compulsions \u2014 ranging from the Taliban rule to China \u2019 s towering presence in Pakistan , the BRI , US \u2019 adversarial relationships with Russia and Iran , NATO \u2019 s progression toward the Indo-Pacific and so on \u2014 apart from the compelling reality that Pakistan is an important regional power and American strategies in the region can not be optimal without Islamabad \u2019 s cooperation and partnership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US acts only in its interests .\nPrice admitted with candour that the US has \u201c different points of interest each \u201d in its relations with India and Pakistan .\nPlainly put , the US has different uses for Pakistan and India and they do not necessarily collide .\nThat said , there must be some disappointment too that India is not performing optimally .\nLook at how the US has led the European allies up the garden path as regards sanctions against Russia .\nIn a speech in the Hungarian parliament on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is about time Europe discussed with Washington the removal of sanctions by the end of the year .\nBy the way , Hungary is a NATO ally .\nYet , Orban accused American oil companies of \u201c war profiteering.\n\u201d Orban now plans to hold a national referendum to ascertain whether his people want the sanctions to continue .\nWelcome to multipolarity .\nNote to

the two Koreas on his way to the summit with his counterpart Kim Jong-Il in Pyongyang .\nThe UNC has used its authority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a wedge in the inter-Korean Railway Projects , and the United States government , which commands the UNC , has been engaged in a tug-of-war to preserve the armistice regime and the Cold War order in Northeast Asia .\nThe US government has been uncooperative on the project to connect railways and roads between North and South Korea .\nThis was the case especially during Republican administrations , namely those of George W. Bush ( 2001\u20132008 ) and Donald W. Trump ( 2017\u20132020 ) although they are hardly the only ones .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their concern that progress in inter-Korean relations should align in pace with the North \u2019 s denuclearization .\nHowever , US refusal to cooperate has a more fundamental cause rooted in the Cold War order in Northeast Asia .\nThe essence of the matter is a tug-of-war over whether the armistice regime should be maintained , keeping the United States in its position of overwhelming supremacy , or whether inter-Korean cooperation is hastened , opening up an opportunity for a transition from the armistice regime to a regime of permanent peace .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea would inevitably have to pass through the Military Demarcation Line ( MDL ) and the Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) .\nThe MDL and the DMZ have their basis in the Korean Armistice Agreement of July 27 , 1953 , signed by the commander of the UN Forces , the supreme commander of the ( North ) Korean People \u2019 s Army , and the commanding officer of the People \u2019 s Volunteer Army of China .\nSouth Korea was not a signatory because Syngman Rhee , the South Korean president at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead advocating that South Korea unify Korea by marching northwards .\nThe MDL , the official name of the ceasefire line , is a boundary line between South and North Korea that replaced that of the 38th parallel according to the Armistice Agreement .\nIt spans 155 miles , from Ganghwa on the western coast to Ganseong on the eastern coast .\nThere is no line drawn on the earth , but if you were to connect the dots of the 1,292 numbered military signposts that run from coast to coast , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The DMZ covers two kilometers on either side to the north and south of the MDL .\nThe Armistice Agreement created this area as a buffer zone , barring armed forces from being stationed there but , in reality , it is a heavily militarized zone , packed with soldiers and heavy weapons along the 100 or so guard posts on the South Korean side and roughly 280 on the North Korean side .\nOff limits to civilians , the DMZ accounts for about 0.5 % of the Korean Peninsula \u2019 s total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west to east from Gyodong Island at the mouths of the Ryesong and Han rivers to the village of Myeongho in Goseong on the East Sea coast , it crosses six large rivers , one plain , and two mountain ranges , encircling a total of 70 villages .\nRailways and highways connecting South and North Korea , therefore , represent a peace corridor , shaking open the MDL and DMZ areas that have remained sealed up and frozen in time for 70 years under the Armistice Agreement \u2019 s spell .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roads succeeded in opening up two vital windpipes along the peninsula \u2019 s midsection : the Gyeongui ( Seoul-Sinuiju ) Line , measuring 250 meters in width , and the Donghae ( East Sea ) Line , measuring 100 meters widthwise .\nEven if their combined 350 meters of breadth represented only 0.14 % of the 250 kilometers of the MDL , they opened the possibility thatthe 80 million people of the Korean Peninsula could continue traveling back and forth along those narrow passages .\nIf they did without interruption , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into coexistence , generating warm spring winds of peace that would melt away the icy wall of the armistice regime .\nIt was a lofty dream broken by a bleak reality , however .\nAt the moment , the 350 meters of hopeful passages have fallen into desuetude .\nNo trains or cars move along them ; no one uses them to visit the other side of the DMZ .\nTo understand the reason , one must heed the saying that if you can not see the road in front of you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed .\nAfter South and North Korea agreed on plans for making the Gyeongui and Donghae railway lines and road linkage project a reality at the first inter-Korea summit , in June 2000 , this meant that they would urgently need the cooperation of the United States .\nFor the construction to go ahead , there had to be an agreement on transferring jurisdiction over the DMZ between the UN forces and the Korean People \u2019 s Army , two of the signatories to the Armistice Agreement .\nBut Donald Rumsfeld , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was resolutely uncooperative .\nUsing the US Forces Korea Command\u2014that is , the UN Command\u2014as his mouthpiece , he communicated a message of pressure to the South Korean minister of national defense , questioning the need to proceed with the inter-Korean railway and road linkage efforts at a time when there were suspicions about the North pursuing a highly enriched uranium program .\nAs the discussions between South Korea and the United States ran into difficulties , the inter-Korean military discussions stalled .\nIn his memoirs \u201c Peacemaker , \u201d former Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blue House finally took action itself , insisting that it was \u201c going to proceed with the railways and road linkage project as agreed upon by the South and North.\n\u201d Lim also writes that the Blue House \u201c demanded that the United States hold general-level talks at Panmunjom without delay to take the necessary measures , while guaranteeing that the groundbreaking ceremony could take place on the agreed-upon date.\n\u201d After all these twists and turns , the \u201c Agreement for Establishing the Joint Administration Areas in the East Sea and West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Railway and Road Effort Connecting South and North \u201d managed to go into effect on Sept. 17 , 2002\u2014a day before the groundbreaking ceremony date agreed upon by South and North Korea .\nWhile the United States may have backed off a bit in the face of the Blue House \u2019 s resolute stance , it did not stop throwing wrenches into the works .\nIn November 2002 , efforts to remove landmines from the Gyeongui Line route in the joint administration area were in their final stages when the US demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North \u2019 s mine-clearing activities were \u201c questionable.\n\u201d After some back and forth , North Korea agreed to the inspection , providing the South with a list of the personnel who would be doing the testing .\nThe US once again doused cold water on the activities , insisting that the UN Command \u2019 s dignity could not be besmirched , and that the North had to submit its information to receive approval directly from the UN Command .\nThe mine clearing initiative was held up for three weeks as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sort things out , the UN Command \u2019 s deputy chief of staff at the time , US Air Force Lt. Gen. James Soligan\u2014known to be one of USFK \u2019 s chief hawks\u2014openly applied pressure in a conversation with the Ministry of National Defense press corps on Nov. 28 , 2002 .\nIn his remarks , he stressed the need to receive the UN Command \u2019 s approval when crossing the MDL for purposes of overland tourism at Mt .\nKumgang , adding that the South Korean military also had to comply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned that inter-Korean exchange and cooperation efforts would not be able to proceed effectively if the Armistice Agreement was not observed .\nSoligan \u2019 s stalling tactics led to the postponement of assistance to North Korea in the form of materials for the railway linkage and land-based tourism at Mt .\nKumgang .\nFinally , the South resolved the differences with the North by including a provision in a supplementary inter-Korean agreement stipulating that the joint administration area was part of the DMZ , and that the Armistice Agreement would have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and safety .\nThat , plus a presidential election in South Korea , led to the United States backing off a bit with its quibbling .\nWriting about the controversy at the time , the Hankyoreh noted , \u201c While this may come across right now as a matter of transit over the Military Demarcation Line , it is a complex issue from a longer-term perspective that also includes matters concerning the replacement of the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement.\n\u201d In his memoir Peacemaker , Lim Dong-won writes , \u201c If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inter-Korean relations might end up in ruins once again , and the Joint Declaration of June 15 [ of 2000 ] might have been scrapped.\n\u201d The United States \u2019 fixation on using the Armistice Agreement as a basis for maintaining jurisdiction over the DMZ remained unchanged even when the warm winds of peace started arriving on the peninsula around 2018 , with three inter-Korean summits and the first North Korea-US summit in history .\nWhen the ninth Korea-Germany Unification Advisory Committee meeting was held in Pyeongchang on June 12\u201313 , 2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the USFK and UN Command , rejected the South Korean Ministry of Unification \u2019 s plan to show the German government delegation preserved Guard Post No .\n829 , located within the DMZ in Goseong , Gangwon Province , citing \u201c safety \u201d concerns .\nThen-South Korean Vice Minister of Unification Suh Ho went so far as to send Abrams a letter of protest , but the UN Command never explained exactly what the \u201c safety reasons \u201d were .\nNo one could see , as a result , Guard Post No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a symbol of peacebuilding to commemorate the removal of all the other posts\u2014evidence of the military confrontation in the DMZ\u2014in the wake of the inter-Korean military agreement of Sept. 19 , 2018 .\nIn 2019 , then-Minister of Unification Kim Yeon-chul made plans to visit Daeseong , the only civilian place of residence within the DMZ , while attending the Aug. 9 opening of the DMZ Peace Trail in Paju at Dorasan Station on the Gyeongui Line .\nThe UN Command continued pouring cold water on Seoul \u2019 s efforts by barring him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , citing the \u201c inconvenience to residents.\n\u201d Does the UN Command\u2014i.e.\n, the USFK Command\u2014get to decide that it \u201c inconveniences residents \u201d for a member of the South Korean Cabinet to visit a community where members of the South Korean public live ?\nEven the cows there would get a good laugh out of that .\nThe Armistice of the Korean War and the UN Command At issue in this controversy is the UN Command \u2019 s authority to grant or deny permission to cross the MDL and enter the DMZ\u2014powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe agreement does not specify the scope or procedures for that authority , but the preamble does stipulate the agreement \u2019 s objective and validity .\nIts aim is to ensure \u201c a complete cessation of hostilities and all acts of armed force in Korea until a final peaceful settlement is achieved \u201d and its \u201c conditions and terms are intended to be purely military in character.\n\u201d With the agreement focusing on preventing war from erupting again , its drafters never envisioned a future when the South and North would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace and crossing the MDL for purposes of reconciliation and cooperation .\nThe UN Command \u2019 s establishment was based on UN Security Council Resolution No .\n84 ( July 7 , 1950 ) , the first item of which states that its aim is to \u201c furnish such assistance to the Republic of Korea as may be necessary to repel the armed attack and to restore international peace and security in the area.\n\u201d That is the premise underlying the UN Command \u2019 s authority .\nThe official letter sent by then-South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1950 , \u201c delegating \u201d operational control for the South Korean military to the UN Command , also limited this measure to the \u201c period of the continuation of the present state of hostilities.\n\u201d It therefore stands to reason that the UN Command \u2019 s authority to grant or deny permission should be limited to matters of a \u201c military character \u201d that are meant to prevent hostile and military actions .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on Instagram and

plans to strip mine run afoul of a provincial ban on open-pit mining .\nIn the remote mountain village of Ned , on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao , the arrival of heavy machinery signals that development is underway on a controversial , long-planned coal mine .\nVillager Jimmy Batilaran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines , including dump trucks and backhoes , have been deployed to the mine \u2019 s development site since July .\n\u201c They operate even in the dead of the night , \u201d he says .\n\u201c Their dump trucks have been hauling at 1 in the morning , disturbing the community with the noise.\n\u201d The mine is being developed by Philippine conglomerate San Miguel Corp. , which in 2010 purchased three companies holding mining contracts in the area : Daguma Agro Minerals Inc. , Sultan Energy Philippines Corp. , and Bonanza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mine can yield 180 million metric tons of coal .\nBut some tribal communities , environment groups and the local Catholic Church oppose the project , citing concerns over the environment , food security and displacement of Indigenous peoples in the area .\nThe arrival of heavy equipment in Ned comes after South Cotabato , the province where most of the deposits lie , endorsed the project in December 2021 .\nSouth Cotabato environment and natural resources officer Siegfred Flaviano described San Miguel \u2019 s current operations as being in the \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined mining areas of the three companies cover some 17,000 hectares ( 42,000 acres ) in an area known to locals as the Daguma Mountain Range .\nMost of the concession falls within Ned , a village of around 41,800 hectares ( 103,300 acres ) that is currently home to corporate coffee plantations and other cash crops cultivated by tribal communities such as corn , peanut and sweet potato .\nIn endorsing the mining contracts , South Cotabato \u2019 s provincial board said the project \u201c will foremost address the hazards caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity called \u2018 burning ground \u2019 that causes significant lung and health problems and \u2018 tension cracks \u2019 that destroy roads and cause landslides.\n\u201d Tension cracks , which form when part of a slope shears off due to underlying instability , have long been an issue in the area , leading government geologists to push for relocation of homes and other infrastructure , and also to call for the extraction of impermeable layers of coal as potential solution .\nHowever , campaigners say mining will cause more problems than it might solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 brown coal \u2019 \u2014 the dirtiest kind of coal there is , \u201d said Cerilo Casicas , a Catholic bishop who is among those leading the campaign to stop the coal mining project .\nDuring the Oct. 5 launch of a petition against the mine , Casicas said the project \u201c will critically impact the ecology and farming activities downstream.\n\u201d Casicas pointed out that the coal mining area lies within two areas of recognized significance for the region \u2019 s water security : the 116,451-hectare ( 287,757-acre ) Kabulnan River Watershed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 252,912 acre ) Allah Valley Watershed Forest Reservation .\nAny damage to these rivers , especially the Allah which is one of the island \u2019 s biggest river systems and a major source of irrigation , could affect \u201c millions of people across Mindanao , \u201d campaigners say .\nThe T \u2019 boli-Manobo S \u2019 daf Claimants Organization ( TAMASCO ) , an Indigenous community based in the village of Ned , has opposed the proposed coal project in their ancestral domain for more than a decade .\n\u201c We disapprove of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indigenous worldview , which treats nature as a sacred source of life , \u201d TAMASCO chief Datu Dande Danyan said in a press statement .\n\u201c We do not need these projects , which only use up the natural resources which we should be taking care of.\n\u201d Tribal lives have already been lost in the struggle to protect their lands .\nIn December 2017 , the Philippine armed forces killed tribal chieftain Datu Victor Danyan and six other tribal members in the village .\nThe victims \u2019 relatives said they were massacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communist supporters and died during a legitimate tactical operation .\nApparently in recognition of the struggle of TAMASCO as well as the environmental impact of the coal mining project , the South Cotabato government specifically excluded the TAMASCO area and all other formally recognized watersheds from their endorsement , \u201c

are all US allies , and if they do not comply with the controls they will lose access to essential US equipment .\nIn August , the US passed the CHIPS and Science Act which included a US $ 50 billion investment in America \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new controls , this amounts to what has been described as \u201c a new US policy of actively strangling large segments of the Chinese technology industry \u2013 strangling with an intent to kill \u201d .\nThe implications of this are far reaching .\nThe stated objective of the new US controls is to limit China \u2019 s ability \u201c to both purchase and manufacture certain high-end chips used in military applications \u201d .\nHowever , high-end chips are used for both military and civilian purposes .\nThese controls will also curtail all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nthis will hamstring the development and deployment of artificial intelligence ( AI ) throughout the country \u2013 hindering Chinese progress in e-commerce , autonomous vehicles , cybersecurity , medical imaging , drug discovery , climate modelling , and much else .\nThis policy is not just about maintaining US tech supremacy .\nIt has the potential to degrade Chinese research across every discipline .\nCan China innovate its way out ?\nIt is unclear how immediate an impact the new controls will have .\nThere has long been speculation that China has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China will no doubt try to work around the controls .\nThe new US measures will inject fresh momentum into existing Chinese efforts to achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency , but this is no easy task .\nManufacturing semiconductors is incomprehensibly complex .\nIt requires facilities so clean they make an operating theatre look dirty and equipment so precise its calibration is impacted by the rotation of the Earth .\nThe more high-end the chip , the more intricate the manufacturing process .\nSome chip manufacturers argue China will not be able to produce advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I \u2019 ll leave that debate to the technical experts , but China \u2019 s ability to innovate should not be underestimated .\nA response is yet to come To date , the direct official response from China has been muted : comparatively mild rebukes from the official Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson that the US seeks only to \u201c maintain its sci-tech hegemony \u201d and \u201c wantonly block and hobble Chinese enterprises \u201d .\nMore importantly , and aside from steps to address supply , the question of China \u2019 s broader response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already experiencing a global chip shortage , particularly of the kind of less sophisticated chips produced in China .\nChina also dominates 80 % of the global supply chain of the rare earth elements that are essential to most high-tech components .\nChina could seek to interrupt the supply of either or both of these , but that would be an uncharacteristically symmetrical response .\nIt would also likely damage China as much as the US .\nIn a speech to the Communist Party Congress a week after the US controls were announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twice , his country \u2019 s goal to \u201c join the ranks of the world \u2019 s most innovative countries , with great self-reliance and strength in science and technology \u201d within five years .\nThe controls announced by the Biden administration directly undermine Xi \u2019 s ambition for China .\nThey seek to maintain US tech supremacy , while simultaneously eroding China \u2019 s ability to conduct fundamental research .\nGiven this , a significant escalatory response from China should not be unexpected .\nThe \u2018 decoupling \u2019 of the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , economies and our daily lives depend on technology it is astounding how many people continue to tune out when technology \u2013 and the policies that shape it \u2013 are discussed .\nIf there ever was a time to tune in , it is now .\nFor several years , leaders and commentators the world over have speculated about the possibility of the US \u201c decoupling \u201d from China : reducing economic and technological entanglement with the rising Asian power .\nDebates on the feasibility of economic decoupling will continue .\nHowever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 7 October 2022 as the moment at which US and Chinese technology decoupling became inevitable .\nThe US has now played its hand .\nThe most

National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict ( NTF-ELCAC ) Spokesperson Lorraine Badoy said .\nSince the founding of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in 1968 and its armed wing , the New People \u2019 s Army ( NPA ) in 1969 , the country has been rife with terrorist activities and armed insurgencies .\nWith a view to ending \u201c 50 years of deceit , lies and atrocities committed by communist terrorists against the Filipino people , \u201d former President Rodrigo Duterte signed Executive Order 70 ( EO 70 ) in 2018 .\nIt institutionalized a whole-of-nation approach that subsequently created the NTF-ELCAC .\nThis task-force is composed of 12 operational clusters , each consisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed by the President as commander and chairman ; the National Security Adviser as vice-chairman ; and an appointed executive director .\nEstablished to dismantle local insurgencies and to spur the development of former guerilla fronts of the CPP-NPA , the NTF-ELCAC initiated the Barangay Development Program ( BDP ) which allocates funds for sustainable rehabilitation projects .\nPresidential Adviser on Peace , Reconciliation and Unity ( OPAPRU ) , Secretary Carlito G. Galvez , Jr. commended the Localized Peace Engagements ( LPE ) cluster as the \u201c most effective way of dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing local leaders to touch base with [ community-level ] insurgents who have expressed their willingness to lay down their arms and return to the folds of law \u201d .\nEverything sounds about right , doesn \u2019 t it ?\nBut there is more than meets the eye .\nThe NTF-ELCAC , primarily designed as a democratic institution aimed towards lasting peace and inclusive development , is on the frontline of relentless red-tagging of human rights activists , journalists , political opposition , labor leaders , and religious groups as communists , terrorists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red-tagging , according to a Supreme Court justice , refers to the \u201c \u2019 phenomenon of implicating progressive civil group leaders to heinous crime , \u2019 or the \u2018 vilification , labelling\u2026 of , \u2019 or \u2018 ascribing guilt by association \u2019 to , organizations in which said individuals and organizations are depicted as communists or communist supporters , \u2018 making them easy targets of government military or paramilitary units \u2019 .\n\u201d Targets \u2014 determined without substantial proof \u2014 are usually subject to harassment and even extrajudicial killing .\nWhile red-tagging has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was during the Duterte administration , particularly upon the institutionalization of the NTF-ELCAC , where the undemocratic practice bore its legitimacy .\nApart from official pronouncements , the inter-agency body regularly utilizes the social media to communicate individual names and groups \u2014 for public derision .\nDomestic human rights defenders and state universities and their constituents are often the object of violence , arbitrary and unlawful killings .\nKarapatan , an \u201c alliance of human rights organizations and programs , human rights \u2019 desks and committees of people \u2019 s organizations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people \u2019 s rights and civil liberties , \u201d has always been in the crosshairs of the NTF .\nNamed members of the said group struggled through the ordeal of online threats and physical assault .\nThe group also compiled records from 2020 of at least 78 people being killed \u201c either from red-tagging or anti-terrorism police operations \u201d and 136 arrests .\nIn another incident in December 2018 , human rights lawyer Angelo Karlo Guillen had his face plastered around Iloilo City , accusing him of membership of the NPA .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tumandok Indigenous People .\nIn 2021 , he survived multiple stab wounds but lost his \u201c laptop and a few documents \u201d .\nIn yet another case in December 2020 , Dr. Mary Rose Sancelan , a red-tagged community doctor , and her husband were shot in Guihulngan City .\nShe was reportedly linked to the NPA .\nJournalists also join the list of red-tagged individuals .\nFrenchiemae Cumpio of Eastern Vista , a local independent news website , has been detained for alleged illegal possession of firearms and involvement with the NPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her colleagues and advocacy groups as charges intended to silence her reporting on the military \u2019 s human rights abuses .\nOnly recently was a regional trial court judge publicly accused to be sleeping with the enemy for dismissing a government petition to tag the CPP-NPA ( and the National Democratic Front ) as terrorists .\nJudge Marlo Malagar and her husband , University of the Philippines-Cebu Chancellor Atty .\nLeo Malagar , received threats arising from a Facebook post by former NTF-ELCAC spokesperson Badoy .\nImplications to Philippine Democracy : One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implementation of the whole-of-nation approach spearheaded by the NTF-ELCAC is arguably a landmark decision in the Philippine history of counterinsurgency and counterterrorism .\nExecutive Order 70 is constitutionally and legally binding .\nIts provisions adhere to democratic principles and processes .\nSimply put , EO 70 is an express measure to safeguard Philippine democracy .\nHowever , as argued by Varol ( 2015 ) and Huq and Ginsburg ( 2018 ) , democratic institutions \u2014 irrespective of quality \u2014 are easily susceptible to abuse by malicious political leaders who manipulate them for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EO 70 through the NTF-ELCAC constitutes a means to an end .\nThe unsystematic practice of red-tagging is tantamount to crackdown on dissent .\nIt has serious repercussion on civil liberties , particularly on freedom of expression and media freedom .\nBy openly targeting progressive groups and individuals who are critical of the government and its programs , the Duterte administration through the NTF-ELCAC was pushing the nation towards a trajectory of \u201c stealth authoritarianism \u201d .\nIntroduced by Varol , this modern concept of authoritarianism is reminiscent of a wolf in sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of authoritarian control that relies on the same legal rules that exist in regimes with favorable democratic credentials ( p. 1678 ) .\nThe Duterte administration used a fa\u00e7ade of democratic institution to silence critics and oppositions .\nSuch institution invites threats or self-censorship , with the latter only reinforcing an echo chamber that is bereft of objective reporting .\nFurther , Badoy \u2019 s attack against Judge Malagar oversteps the bounds of democracy by challenging autonomous judicial processes .\nThe red list is essentially a hit list , a death sentence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic of a democracy .\nThe Philippines under the Duterte administration was never a free democracy , as opposed to Badoy \u2019 s remark ; but a soft tyranny or stealth authoritarianism .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on Instagram and Twitter and subscribe to our Telegram Channel .\nFeel free to repost and share widely

.\nThe United Nations Human Rights Committee is a treaty body composed of 18 experts , established through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ICCPR ) .\nThe Committee meets for three four-week sessions per year to consider the periodic reports submitted by the 173 state parties to the ICCPR on their compliance with the treaty .\nThe 2022 report of the Human Rights Committee highlights the ongoing failure of the Philippine government in ensuring that human rights are upheld .\nThe recommendations take note of the issues and instruments that have contributed to a system of impunity and state-orchestrated terror , such as : the red-tagging of human rights defenders and attacks on journalists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guise of the war on drugs ; and the repressive provisions of the Anti-Terror Law which target the fundamental foundations of democracy , freedom of assembly , freedom of expression and the right to dissent .\nThe Committee \u2019 s recommendations are timely , given the continuing human rights violations under the new Marcos administration .\nThe current administration must not ignore nor downplay these recommendations and instead find concrete ways of upholding its treaty obligations under the ICCPR .\nThere was a great deal of interest expressed among member states in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total of 107 states intervened and about 40 % took a critical stand and supported the Committee \u2019 s recommendations .\nThere is a general reticence among the majority of member states to be critical towards the Philippines \u2019 abysmal human rights record .\nDespite the UN \u2019 s ongoing documentation of the Philippine \u2019 s poor civil and political rights record which dramatically worsened under the Duterte administration , only a minority of states are willing to openly express concerns and even fewer were willing to make strong recommendations for action ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nWe specifically laud the intervention of Sierra Leone who called for the abolition of the NTF-ELCAC ( National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict ) which has functioned as one of the main instruments of state terror against dissidents .\nSeveral member states including Lichtenstein , Sierra Leone , Sweden , Romania , and the USA , called for an end to the practice of red-tagging , a process by which individuals and organizations are labelled as fronts for the Communist Party of the Philippines .\nThe Philippine representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Justice , for his part angrily responded to the US criticism claiming , \u201c there is no government policy of red-tagging , it is a term invented by the left \u201d .\nThis was a complete turnabout from Remulla \u2019 s contention two weeks earlier that red tagging was a government right and a vibrant part of the democratic process .\nThis is an example of the Philippine government \u2019 s state of denial to the international community regarding its continuing war on dissent .\nICHRP Chairperson Peter Murphy expressed \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke out pressing for greater accountability from the Philippine government , \u201d but he urged the international community to \u201c press member states for concrete action on human rights from the Marcos administration \u201d .\nHe further called for an immediate need for an end to the supply weapons to the Marcos government , noting

economic policies that directly challenge the possibility of accommodation with China .\nIn an arc of militarization across northern Australia , successive Australian governments , in close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded to the rise of a newly assertive China in terms that constitute an almost historically irrevocable opposition to any accommodation with China as a regional great power .\nFrom the high-technology bases clustered along the length of North West Cape in Western Australia ( including the newly built Space Surveillance Radar and the Space Surveillance Telescope supplying data on the position , behaviour , and character of adversary countries satellites ) , to the port and barracks and air base of Darwin , to the newly joint RAAF-US Air Force base of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment to US global military operations , conventional and nuclear , of a rapidly expanding Pine Gap outside Alice Springs , Australia is joining the United States in preparation for war with China , most immediately over a war over Taiwan .\nIn part , this is nothing new .\nPost-1945 Australia , like some other liberal democracies allied to the United States , is a case of dependent , high-technology liberal militarization .\nThis pattern is curiously hard for Australians to recognize \u2013 as always for states that valorize their liberal virtues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia founded on the untranscended , let alone fully recognized , mass violence of settler colonial conquest that is still unfolding .\nMoreover , as this new phase of Australian militarization exemplifies , it reflects the character of American empire , one key part of which is the worldwide network of US and allied military bases and deployed military personnel , and most importantly , globally distributed elements of US-controlled but coalition-accessed space and terrestrial surveillance sensor systems , communications and computing systems \u2013 all tied to US and coalition military operations .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent militarization is manifest far from the population centres \u2013 socially and culturally out of sight , even when it is close-up , as in the small town of Alice Springs , next door to Pine Gap .\nBut the pace of militarisation , and the attendant loss of freedom of action for any independently minded Australian government , is quickening through preparations for the China target .\nIn the midst of this rush to join forces , in Canberra there is a profound lack of competent assessment within government and the wider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Australia \u2019 s strategic interests and those of the US actually align over the Taiwan issue .\nFor Australia , the turmoil of structural and contingent disruptions in the world economy in the last few years are magnified by the implications of US security-directed economic and technological decoupling from China for an economy that I highly dependent on commodity exports to China \u2013 all against a background of historically constitutive racially-inflected \u2018 fear of China \u2019 .\nUS alliance structures are clearly changing shape .\nAs has often been noted this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revivified US dominance of NATO .\nThus after two decades of Australian Defence Force high-tempo participation in NATO-auspiced coalition operations in Afghanistan , Iraq , and the Indian Ocean , the Australian military has become habituated to a new alliance role as an Enhanced Strategic Partner of NATO .\nAnthony Albanese ( left ) , the then newly elected Australian Labor prime minister joined his Japanese , South Korean and New Zealand equivalents at the 2022 NATO Madrid summit .\nThe dark follies of the AUKUS agreement to build Australian nuclear-powered submarines apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ultimate goal for Washington in the construction of \u2018 an alliance of democracies \u2019 with global reach .\nIn the \u2018 Indo-Pacific \u2019 , the half century of US-centred hub-and-spokes alliance structures are noticeably beginning to be reshaped , again under US direction through : \u2022 the Quad , a lose security structure bringing together Japan , Australia , India and the United States ; \u2022 bilateral connections between second-level US allies in the form of security , logistics , and basing access agreements such as that between Australia and Japan ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of the cancellation of a massive French submarine contract , bilateral cooperation and an expansion of existing basing and logistics agreements between Australia and France with its interest in power projection into the Indian Ocean and the Pacific based on its colonial territories in both regions .\nNow , Canberra also seems increasingly drawn into a sense \u2013 increasingly prevalent amongst

successful US-led ideological construction of the binary identifications of \u2018 Russia = China , Putin = Xi Jinping , and Ukraine = Taiwan \u2019 all combine with the hard-wiring of northern Australian military facilities into the US military force structure to drastically reduce the freedom of action of an independently-minded Australian government focused on the actual defence of Australia .\nPine Gap \u2013 Critical for Warfighting , Expanding , and Still a Priority Nuclear Target While nominally a joint Australian/US affair , the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap outside Alice Springs is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , equipped with some 45 antennas , mostly in radomes , as the visible expression the base \u2019 s surveillance role as ground station for US giant signals intelligence satellites and infrared early warning satellites , in addition to hosting antennas that collect signals downlinked from foreign communications satellites on an industrial scale .\nPine Gap , already large and now growing more rapidly than ever before , will play an irreplaceable role in US military operations from Africa to the Pacific and everything in between , both conventional and nuclear .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roles in US planning for a war with China over Taiwan .\nAustralian governments have long known , though rarely even hinted publicly , that they have known for half a century that Pine Gap was \u2013 and is \u2013 a high priority Soviet/Russian nuclear target in the event of major conflict with the US .\nThe base remains so today for China , with roughly the same number of priority targets as Russia , but less than a tenth the number of long-range nuclear missiles that would be up to the task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay B-52s have been landing at RAAF Darwin regularly since 2013 after the Gillard-Obama Darwin basing agreement , but expansion of Tindal to meet USAF requirements for B-52 deployments would make permanent presence possible .\nMoreover , the Morrison government \u2019 s 2020 commitment of $ 1.1 bn for the United States Force Posture Initiative Airfield Works Project Elements at RAAF Base Tindal will have to be re-framed while Canberra adjusts to the Pentagon \u2019 s newest plans for a B-52 Bomber Task Force on permanent rotation from their home base in Barksdale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender documents released by the Australian Broadcasting Company \u2019 s Four Corners , the US is planning yet further development at Tindal \u2013 beyond that acknowledged by the Australian government \u2013 for a USAF B-52 bomber task force on permanent rotation including an \u2018 aircraft parking apron to accommodate six B-52s \u2019 , a USAF \u2018 squadron operations facility \u2019 , plus USAF maintenance centre , fuel dump , and ammunition depot .\nOne key tender document for the Pentagon \u2019 s B-52 deployment to Tindal was dated as recently as 22 September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Vulnerable Guam For the Pentagon , a B-52 deployment to Tindal provides backup to the increasingly vulnerable Andersen AFB on tiny , heavily militarised Guam .\nAs former Deputy Secretary of Defence Paul Dibb put it on Four Corners : America has to take out an insurance policy because a lot of its forward military bases in places like the island of Guam near Japan and elsewhere in the region are coming much closer to Chinese military strike capabilities .\nBut beyond the Tindal fallback factor , the USAF is banking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bomber Task Force operations towards China in the form of the RAAF \u2019 s E-7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft , plus the RAAF \u2019 s long-range tanker capability , and F-35 multirole fighters .\nWhile apparently unquestioned in Canberra , this unquestioned technical , doctrinal , and organizational integration of

, with each capable of carrying up to 20 nuclear-armed air-launched cruise missiles .\nAt present , the language of the B-52 permanent rotational deployment is in terms of training , as was the Fraser government \u2019 s 1981 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercises into Darwin .\nFraser \u2019 s agreement required explicit Australian government prior approval of use of that access for any other purpose .\nWe know nothing of the implementing agreements under the Morrison and Albanese government \u2019 s allowing the Tindal deployment .\nThe issue of the constraints on the deployment under an implementing agreement will become critically important in the event f a crisis-driven US decision to bring the B-52s into war .\nPine Gap Satellite Surveillance Base , Australia , 2016 ( courtesy of Felicity Ruby , available at Felicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defence Facilities Pine Gap , Nautilus Institute .\nThe fabled doctrine of the Australian government controlling the uses to which the joint facilities can be put is phrased in legal agreements as our \u2018 Full Knowledge and Concurrence \u2019 with American operational uses of Pine Gap , all the North West Cape cluster of bases , and now RAAF Tindal and more .\nAnd yet , nuclear-capable B52 bombers at Tindal raise a fundamental issue for Australia which requires urgent clarification by the Albanese government : the prohibition under the Treaty of Raratongaestablishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Article 5 of which begins , unambiguously : \u2018 1 .\nEach Party undertakes to prevent in its territory the stationing of any nuclear explosive device.\n\u2019 However , during the negotiations of that treaty Australia supported the position of the United States that any Pacific NWFZ must allow the transit of nuclear weapons on board visiting ships and aircraft , resulting in a second clause to Article 5 : \u2018 2 .\nEach Party in the exercise of its sovereign rights remains free to decide for itself whether to allow visits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports and airfields , transit of its airspace by foreign aircraft , and navigation by foreign ships in its territorial sea or archipelagic waters in a manner not covered by the rights of innocent passage , archipelagic sea lane passage or transit passage of straits.\n\u2019 The US \u2013 and Australian \u2013 intent was \u2018 No More New Zealands \u2019 , following the Langer Labor government \u2019 s banning of nuclear-armed or nuclear-powered warships in 1984 .\nWhile a normal interpretation of the meaning of \u2018 visits \u2019 and \u2018 transit \u2019 would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deployments , this second clause is now more deeply problematic than ever .\nAs a matter of urgency the Albanese government should declare that it accepts that under the South Pacific Nuclear Weapons Free Zone any deployments of nuclear weapons to Australia in any form or under any pretext will not be permitted .\nThe government must require the US to answer the key questions pertaining to its deployment of B-52s : \u2022 Will US nuclear strategic weapons be brought to Australia in any form , for whatever duration , under any circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US nuclear-capable bomber deploys to Australia , is

experimenting with digital currency .\nIndia is working on developing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase of testing .\nAfter successfully running a pilot program to test its digital currency at the wholesale level , the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has announced it will test the digital rupee in a retail setting .\nAccording to the RBI , the central bank digital currency \u201c is a legal tender issued by a central bank in a digital form .\nIt is the same as a fiat currency and is exchangeable one-to-one with the fiat currency .\nOnly its form is different.\n\u201d Digital currencies are similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist as virtual banknotes or coins held in a digital wallet on your computer or smartphone .\nThe difference between a government digital currency and bitcoin is the value of the digital currency is backed and controlled by the state , just like traditional fiat currency .\nAs the RBI put it , \u201c Unlike cryptocurrencies , a CBDC isn \u2019 t a commodity or claims on commodities or digital assets .\nCryptocurrencies have no issuer .\nThey are not money ( certainly not currency ) as the word has come to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Economic Times of India , the National Payments Corporation of India will host the platform for the digital rupee payment system during the testing phase .\nThe Reserve Bank of India wants each commercial bank in the pilot to test retail use of the digital rupee with 10,000 to 50,000 users .\nState Bank of India , Bank of Baroda , Union Bank of India , ICICI Bank , HDFC Bank , Kotak Mahindra Bank , Yes Bank and IDFC First Bank will participate

cash.\n\u201d The elimination of cash creates the potential for the government to track and even control consumer spending , and it would make it even easier for central banks to engage in manipulative monetary policies such as negative interest rates .\nImagine if there was no cash .\nIt would be impossible to hide even the smallest transaction from government eyes .\nSomething as

currency got a boost when the country \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform to accept the Chinese digital currency .\nEconomist Thorsten Polleit outlined the potential for Big Brother-like government control with the advent of a digital euro in an article published by the Mises Wire .\nAs he put it , \u201c the path to becoming a surveillance state regime will accelerate considerably \u201d if and

Barrier Reef potentially being listed on the World Heritage \u201c in danger \u201d list .\nAfter all , there have been similar calls in 2012 , 2013 , 2014 and 2017 .\nSuccessive federal governments have lobbied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world off the high-profile list kept by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) .\nOnly last year , former environment minister Sussan Ley jetted around the world in a successful effort to stave off the inevitable , pointing to hundreds of millions of dollars spent on issues such as water quality .\nThe new minister , Tanya Plibersek , also wants to avoid having the reef \u201c singled out \u201d in this way .\nThe question is , what does in-danger mean ?\nEveryone knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-danger listing is not a sanction or punishment .\nRather , it \u2019 s a call to the international community that a World Heritage property is under threat , requiring actions to protect it for future generations .\nIn-danger listing is not permanent , nor does it mean the Reef will be permanently removed from the World Heritage list .\nThe reef faces a multitude of threats .\nThe most significant threats are coral bleaching worsened by climate change , poor water quality from land-based runoff , and unsustainable fishing and coastal development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them \u2013 but we need more effective enforcement to ensure compliance .\nThe Great Barrier Reef has been World Heritage listed since 1981 .\nThis means it \u2019 s considered an area of outstanding value to humanity .\nCovering an area the size of Italy , this iconic area includes some 3,000 separate reefs , over 1,000 islands and a variety of other significant habitats .\nThe latest UN mission has just reported back , finding the reef \u2019 s condition is worsening and recommending it be listed as \u201c in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions .\nPrevious governments have fought to ensure the reef is not listed as in-danger despite their own five-yearly reviews demonstrating an obvious decline .\nIn 2009 , the reef \u2019 s condition was rated poor and declining .\nIn 2014 it was poor and declining and in 2019 , very poor and declining .\nSo the government knows the reef is in danger .\nWe know , and the tourism industry knows .\nWhile some tourism operators worry about their business , the opposite appears to be true : more people go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to see it .\nAnd already , operators are adapting by taking tourists to areas still in good condition .\nFederal governments just don \u2019 t want the reef on the list because of the hit to their international reputation \u2013 and to their domestic standing .\nIf the reef is officially listed as \u201c in danger \u201d next year , it will draw a much greater focus to the reef \u2019 s plight .\nAnd that may help galvanise effective national and global action .\nTake the case of the famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhen these reefs were listed , the government banned nearby oil exploration and protected mangroves .\nBelize \u2019 s reefs have now been taken off the in-danger list .\nSo what has to be done ?\nThe mission \u2019 s report lays out what needs to be done for the major issues .\nAustralia already has a long-term plan aimed at ensuring the reef \u2019 s sustainability .\nThere are regulations governing , say , sediment and water quality in run off from agriculture and towns .\nWe have some targets too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem is delivery .\nThere is a need to scale up efforts and improve compliance .\nRegulations mean very little if there \u2019 s ineffective enforcement .\nFor example , while most farmers have taken on board the rules around fertiliser use , erosion and run-off , those flouting the rules get only a slap on the wrist .\nAs the state government notes , enforcement is a \u201c last resort \u201d .\nThe UN mission has called on Australia to improve in four key areas : 1 .\nLook after land and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes erosion more likely .\nEroded soils are washed downstream and out to sea , where they can settle on coral and seagrass , smothering them .\nIn Queensland , native vegetation is still being cleared at unsustainable levels .\nThese long nets catch fish by their gills .\nBut they also catch dugongs , dolphins and turtles , which then die .\nThe UN mission made a very strong recommendation : phase out gillnets in the marine park .\nDredging shipping channels and ports produces a lot of silt and sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas , it can also spread to nearby corals and seagrass beds already under stress from climate change .\nA previous government policy ended the dumping of capital dredge spoil ( dredging previously undisturbed areas ) .\nBut maintenance dredge spoil is still being dumped at sea or used for reclamation , both causing adverse impacts .\nThis month , the northern reefs are sweltering in record water temperatures \u2013 raising the chance of further bleaching events .\nThe UN report makes it clear that climate change is the biggest threat .\nClimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coral bleaching and potentially coral death .\nAustralia , as one of the world \u2019 s top exporters of fossil fuels gas and coal , has long tried to go slow on climate action .\nThe new government has moved to legislate a stronger 2030 emissions reduction target , but the UN report calls for even more ambition to keep warming under 1.5\u2103 as this is widely accepted as the critical threshold for reef survival .\nThe report doesn \u2019 t make reference to the impacts of shipping on nearby coral and seagrass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by propellers of large ships and tankers .\nIf you dive the reef for the first time this year , you might wonder if there really is a problem .\nAfter all , there are still fish and coral .\nWhen I first dove on the reef more than 35 years ago , it was in much better condition .\nWhat you see now may seem okay \u2013 but it \u2019 s a pale shadow of what it could or should be .\nIt \u2019 s death by a thousand cuts .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The reef is in dire trouble , but it \u2019 s decades away before it \u2019 s no longer worth visiting .\nThat \u2019 s the truth .\nBut unless we wake up and deal with climate change sincerely and deeply then we really will have a Great Barrier Reef not worth visiting .\nWe \u2019 re never going to restore the reef to its pre-European conditions .\nBut unless we take real action , future generations will wonder how and why we failed them so badly .\nWe don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee to make in-danger listing to

Global Research articles .\nVice President Kamala Harris visited the Philippines last week in what can only be described as three days of warmongering , hypocrisy , and another huge provocation against China .\nHarris spent her time spouting empty platitudes of affirmation regarding U.S. defense commitments to the Philippines and underscoring U.S. commitment to upholding human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China .\nThe Vice President \u2019 s visit was an attempt to make nice with an old U.S. ally after the tumultuous terms of both former U.S. President Donald Trump and former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte .\nU.S.-Philippine relations were strained as Trump questioned the value of U.S. defense commitments to the archipelago and Duterte inched closer to China .\nThe disastrous and deadly war on drugs , which killed thousands of mostly petty suspects , was just one among many human rights abuses by the Duterte regime .\nYet , little has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. , son of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr. , ran a campaign that tried to erase the human rights abuses under his father \u2019 s regime .\nFurther , Marcos Jr. has not stopped Duterte \u2019 s war on drugs , violence and threats against progressive activists and independent journalists continue , and government propaganda is ubiquitous .\nThe human rights situation in the Philippines remains poor .\nWhile Harris met with human rights activists to underscore the United States \u2019 enduring commitment to human rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philippines , protestors took to the streets of Manila displaying slogans like \u201c stop funding state terrorism in the Philippines , \u201d \u201c stop U.S. military aid to the Philippines \u201d and \u201c US Imperialism # 1 Terrorist.\n\u201d But none of that matters to the United States if it means risking its hegemony in the region .\nDuring her trip , Harris told Marcos Jr. that \u201c an armed attack on the Philippines armed forces , public vessels , or aircraft in the South China Sea would invoke U.S. mutual defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a special speech to members of the Philippine Coast Guard in Palawan , the province closest to the highly contested Spratly Islands .\nPalawan is also home to the Antonio Bautista Air Base , the center of Philippine military command responsible for patrolling and defending the Spratly Islands \u2019 waters .\nDuring her speech in Palawan , Harris reaffirmed that the United States \u201c stands with the Philippines in the face of intimidation and coercion in the South China Sea , \u201d all but naming China as the aggressor .\nIn 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of the Philippines , stating China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to most of the South China Sea .\nThe Philippines has complained of Chinese aggression around the Spratly Islands , to include overfishing and even harassment of its fishing and naval vessels .\nIf the United States wanted to heighten tensions with China , choosing Palawan for Harris \u2019 speech was certainly one way to achieve that goal .\nThis visit was really about expanding U.S. influence in the region under the Obama-era Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it will receive help from the United States over maritime disputes .\nHarris stated the United States is seeking additional locations under the agreement , which permits the United States to move troops into the Philippines for extended stays and to build and operate facilities on Philippine bases .\nThe Vice President confirmed the United States will spend $ 66.5 million expanding its military presence under the pact .\nThe United States is bulking up its military presence in Asia to balance against China , a dangerous strategy proven to lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context of Harris \u2019 visit against U.S. provocations toward China in the past few months .\nIn August , then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan , resulting in the expected : forceful and coercive Chinese military , economic , and diplomatic measures .\nIn other words , Pelosi \u2019 s Taipei visit set off a Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis .\nPresident Biden has publicly announced not once , but thrice , that the United States would aid Taiwan in the face of a Chinese attack , dangerously moving away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After Biden \u2019 s 60 Minutes interview , in which he abandoned strategic ambiguity and admitted the United States would defend Taiwan in an unprecedented Chinese attack , a White House official said that is not formal U.S. policy .\nIn recent meetings with Chinese President Xi , Biden backpedaled and said the United States remains committed to the status quo and the One China policy .\nSo which is it ?\nChina is likely wondering who is calling the shots for the United States and which narrative it can trust .\nThese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assure China that the United States is seeking peace or the status quo .\nUnder the guise of assuring an ally , Kamala Harris went to the Philippines to tout U.S. imperialism and reassert Uncle Sam as the true hegemon of Asia .\nThe United States must stop cozying up to one brutal regime to oppose another , and undergo a serious reexamination of its current security guarantees in Asia .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above .\nFollow

.\nAustralia \u2019 s relations with China will take another major step forward this week with Foreign Minister Penny Wong travelling to Beijing for the resumption of the bilateral Foreign and Strategic Dialogue , which has been on hold since 2018 .\nThe latest breakthrough follows the meeting between Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the G20 summit .\nWong \u2019 s Wednesday talks coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Whitlam government establishing diplomatic relations with China on December 21 1972 \u2013 an anniversary the Chinese government had been indicating it wanted to mark .\nThey are also part of a round of meetings with foreign ministers that China is conducting .\nAustralian exporters will hope the meeting paves the way to China easing the trade restrictions it has imposed on Australia .\nThe improved relations may also be positive for detained Australians Cheng Lei and Yang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wong said : \u201c In 1972 , then Prime Minister Gough Whitlam took a bold decision , recognising the importance of engagement and cooperation between our two nations and peoples .\n\u201c In the decades since , China has grown to become one of the world \u2019 s largest economies and Australia \u2019 s largest trading partner .\n\u201c Trade between Australia and China , as well as strong people-to-people , cultural and business links have delivered significant benefits to both our countries.\n\u201d They said Wong was going to Beijing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet China \u2019 s State Councilor and Minister of Foreign Affairs , Wang Yi , and hold the 6th Australia\u2013China Foreign and Strategic Dialogue \u201d .\nAlbanese and Wong said they welcomed the opportunity to mark the anniversary of diplomatic relations .\n\u201c Australia seeks a stable relationship with China ; we will cooperate where we can , disagree where we must and engage in the national interest.\n\u201d Albanese flagged this latest breakthrough on Friday \u2019 s podcast with The Conversation , although he did not specify the form it would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner and I think in coming weeks you will see further measures and activities which indicate a much-improved relationship , which is in the interests of both of our countries , but importantly as well is in the interests of peace and security in the region.\n\u201d The thawing in relations , which began with overtures from China as soon as Labor was elected , came after the Chinese government had previously refused to even return the Morrison government \u2019 s phone calls .\nChina had been angered by the Coalition \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its harsh rhetoric , for which then defence minister Peter Dutton was notable .\nAustralia \u2019 s pressure for an inquiry into the origins of COVID-19 was a high-profile source of tension .\nThe Albanese government has been aware of the need for caution as it looks to stabilise the relationship , repeatedly making it clear Australia would not give any concession to get an improvement .\nShadow foreign minister Simon Birmingham said the Coalition welcomed Wong \u2019 s plans to visit .\n\u201c Engagement between governments is essential to advance areas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d he said , but added that \u201c the ultimate test of any dialogue lies in the outcomes achieved \u201d .\n\u201c Minister Wong \u2019 s visit will be judged on progress towards the removal of unwarranted tariffs and sanctions on Australian exports ; achieving fair and transparent treatment of Australians currently detained in China ; advancing regional security via respect for international law ; and securing greater transparency on human rights issues of concern , \u201d Birmingham said .\n\u201c Australia should also continue to appeal for China to use its influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal invasion of Ukraine.\n\u201d Birmingham said the Wong visit would be the first by an Australian minister since his final visit as trade minister in November 2019 .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above .\nFollow us on Instagram and Twitter and subscribe to our Telegram Channel .\nFeel free to repost and share widely

that the peninsula \u2019 s status quo drags on .\nFor South Koreans , they are business as usual .\nAnd don \u2019 t expect any major change in the new year : There is more of the same to come .\nOn December 20 , South Korean Defense Minister Lee Jong-sup said South Korea and the US will conduct 20 training exercises in 2023 , including amphibious assault drills .\nThe decision was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of combined field drills\u2026in light of advancing North Korean nuclear and missile threats , \u201d Lee said .\nSeoul announced today that it is mulling major joint artillery drills in 2023 to mark 70 years of the bilateral alliance , which was signed as the smoke from the Korean War cleared in 1953 .\nThe last time such drills were held was in 2017 .\nBetween 2018 and 2021 , multiple training drills were put on hold under Seoul \u2019 s progressive Moon Jae-in administration .\nThis happened , firstly , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , latterly , due to Covid-19 risks .\nBut under the conservative Yoon Suk-yeol administration , which took office in May , drills have restarted with a vengeance .\nWhile joint drills are essential to ensure military interoperabilities and overall credibility , they are a red rag to North Korea .\nPyongyang considers drills to be war preparations .\nThe country has borrowed heavily from Soviet-Russian doctrine , and in February this year , Moscow did , indeed , use winter exercises to pre-deploy units for its Ukraine invasion .\nMeanwhile , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea will soon conduct what would be its seventh nuclear test \u2013 albeit , this alarm bell has been ringing constantly , and so far incorrectly , since the beginning of 2022 .\nAt a time when differences between the authoritarian bloc and liberal democracies appear to be solidifying on the global chessboard , the peninsula \u2019 s status quo looks to be further cemented .\nYet this dire outlook is not reflected in fear in South Korea .\nAll quiet on the Korean front While generals , politicians and editors fret over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunkers behind South Korean apartment complexes , nor are shocks decimating South Korean capital markets .\n\u201c This is the unique nature of Korean society : We live right next to North Korea , \u201d said Chun In-bum , a retired South Korean general .\n\u201c It is like living next to a volcano , but if you don \u2019 t have the option to move , you just continue and hope for the best.\n\u201d \u201c For the US , it is like a fire across the river \u2013 but that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chun continued .\n\u201c For South Koreans , it is such a nightmare that ignorance is bliss so we act as if nothing is wrong.\n\u201d \u201c There is proximity and geography and force deployed close together , with historical animosity \u2013 we live in the shadow of that , \u201d said Dan Pinkston , an American international relations professor at Troy University .\nBut he added that he does not fear his home being hit by a missile : \u201c

writings , they paradoxically say that North Korean spy satellites might make the situation more stable , \u201d said Andrei Lankov , a Russian specialist in North Korea who teaches in Seoul \u2019 s Kookmin University .\n\u201c North Korea is afraid of attack as they don \u2019 t get reliable intelligence in real-time so rely on agents who are unreliable , \u201d Lankov explained .\n\u201c If they have real reliable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry over sudden attacks so the chance of confrontation goes down.\n\u201d Still , Lankov admits that Pyongyang \u2019 s apparent advances in solid fuel engines increase risk .\nLiquid fuel missiles need to be fueled up before being launched , providing defenders with both a warning and a window of opportunity to pre-empt them .\nSolid fuels lessen the vulnerability of a missile that requires time to take on propellant at or near its launch site before being fired .\nOutside the peninsula , virtually all indications are that the gap between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is widening to a chasm .\nMoscow \u2019 s assault upon Ukraine has unified the Global North , with prosperous democracies as far distant from the action as Australia , Japan and South Korea joining North America and Western Europe in funneling aid and arms to Kiev .\nIran is providing direct military aid to Russia , indications are increasing that North Korea is supplying munitions and missiles , and China is providing diplomatic backing , if not more .\nMeanwhile , the US , constantly fretting over a potential Chinese attack on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Beijing .\nAs part of that chip war , Washington is rail-roading its allies into a struggle that could end up costing their chip companies scores of billions of dollars .\nAnd Japan , after two years of discussion since abandoning its Aegis Ashore missile defense system in 2020 , last week formally announced plans to create a missile-based counterstrike force to balance potential Chinese , North Korean and Russian threats .\nGiven these various signs of global bifurcation , up-arming and technological weaponization , there seems little likelihood that the Korean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site of a civil war that spiraled into a murderous Cold War hot war \u2013 will break free of the wider trend .\nThat is true even though Pyongyang might like to widen its economic dependence beyond Beijing .\n\u201c The North Koreans would be far more comfortable outside the Chinese sphere of influence , \u201d Lankov said .\n\u201c But none of their opposite numbers is willing to make concessions strong and attractive enough for them to engage in negotiations.\n\u201d Amid this big-picture backdrop , the Korean peninsula remains a pivot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stakeholders have selfish interests : The Kim regime seeks to entrench its survival while arms manufacturers benefit from the threat that the up-arming regime represents .\nAll this argues for a continuance of rising-falling tensions as North Korea hones its weapons and military systems , and for continued deterrence efforts as South Korea and the US shore up their alliance .\n\u201c The Korean peninsula is a microcosm but what are the choices ?\nAppease , acquiesce , sign a peace treaty and give them what they want \u2013 or prepare for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conundrum facing strategists .\n\u201c If liberal democracies did nothing and just took it on the chin , that would be

force amid growing border tensions with China and possibly a failing strategic deterrent posture .\nLast week , Swarajya reported that India was building multi-purpose storage tunnels in border states to store short-range ballistic missiles ( SRBMs ) and might soon be acquiring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes that these tunnels would keep India \u2019 s missile arsenal safe from pre-emptive attack and allow it to mount a quick counterstrike .\nIt also says the Pralay missile could be used against Chinese troop concentrations along the disputed Line of Actual Control ( LAC ) between the two countries .\nFurther , last week India Today reported that the Indian Ministry of Defense had approved the purchase of 120 Pralay missiles as part of building the Indian Rocket Force ( IRF ) , with these missiles to be deployed in border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rocket force has received a boost as the proposal to buy around 120 Pralay ballistic missiles has been cleared by a high-level Defense Ministry meeting , \u201d an unnamed government official was quoted as saying .\nThe Economic Times describes the Pralay as a solid-fuel quasi-ballistic surface-to-surface missile with a range of 150 to 500 kilometers , difficult to intercept , and able to change direction in midair .\nIt says the Pralay can take out long-range enemy air defense systems , high-value targets , and weapons such as heavy artillery .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s tactical ballistic-missile gap , noting that China and Pakistan already have such weapons .\nIt also mentions that Pralay was first developed in 2015 and was successfully tested on December 21 and 22 , 2021 .\nIn addition , The Times of India reported this month that India conducted night tests of its nuclear-capable Agni-V missile amid fresh border tensions with China .\nThe source claims that the Agni-V is one of India \u2019 s most formidable missiles , sporting a 5,000-kilometer range capable of hitting the northernmost parts of China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clashes between China and India in the Himalayas .\nLast week , The Indian Express reported that on December 9 , 70 to 80 Indian troops repelled an incursion by 300 Chinese soldiers after a few hours of hand-to-hand fighting at Tawang , Arunachal Pradesh , at the LAC , with soldiers from both sides sustaining some injuries .\nThe source says such incursions show that China is unilaterally attempting to change the border status quo .\nIt also mentions previous forays , such as the 2020 Galwan clashes , which left 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident in 2016 where 250 Chinese soldiers crossed the area , but no clashes were reported .\nThe idea of creating an Indian rocket force has been discussed in the country \u2019 s defense circles .\nHowever , in a November 2021 article in The Diplomat , Saurav Jha wrote that the military asymmetry between China and India was the primary driver for the latter to establish a rocket force .\nSpecifically , Jha cited former Indian Army chief of staff General Manoj Mukund Naravane , who said future military conflicts would follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations , with rear facilities such as command and control posts , logistics hubs , airfields , and communication nodes taking the first salvo from precision standoff weapons .\nNaravane , as cited by Jha , then said the second salvo of autonomous drones would aim to overwhelm and destroy air defenses , artillery pieces , missile bases , and tank formations , while rocket and gun artillery attacks finished off troops at forward-deployed localities .\nNaravane also mentioned lessons learned from the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War , noting that concentrating forces increases vulnerability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to concentrate fire rather than platforms .\nGiven Naravane \u2019 s ideas , Jha wrote that the Indian Army might not be able to rely on air support in the opening phase of a future conflict and that precision standoff weapons would be vital to enabling offensive and defensive air operations .\nHe also said establishing the IRF would signal that the country \u2019 s use of surface-to-surface missiles with mass and precision in a limited war in \u201c non-contact \u201d warfare in a joint force environment .\nYet another reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocket force is that its deterrence posture against China is failing .\nIn a Foreign Policy article this month , Sushant Singh wrote that India \u2019 s economic entanglement with China , lack of diplomatic reaction to China \u2019 s incursions in the Himalayas , participation in China-led multilateral summits , and participation in China-led military exercises may show India \u2019 s inability to act decisively against China .\nSingh also said India \u2019 s desire to be part of the Global South and have a seat at the Global North \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with its long-standing disputes with China .\nHe said this foreign-policy prism has precluded India from committing to the US-led Quad alliance .\nStill , the recent border clashes with China may force India to take more decisive steps .\nRegarding IRF requirements , a November 2021 article in India Defense Research Wing ( IDRW ) says it will require 50,000 to 70,000 personnel and three or four ballistic-missile brigades independently deployed in the country \u2019 s eastern and western regions .\nFile photo of the Prithvi missile .\nPhoto : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defense However , the source also mentions that India has a low rate of ballistic-missile production , with the 1980s-vintage Prithvi SRBM being its mainstay and being designed to deliver nuclear warheads rather than for tactical use .\nThe source says India has yet to adopt road-mobile tactical ballistic missiles fully , with only limited Shaurya and Prahaar missiles .\nEstablishing the IRF will require vast numbers of these missiles .\nIt also says that while India has the Brahmos supersonic cruise and hypersonic missiles in the works , these weapons are too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , the jury is split when it comes to establishing an Indian rocket force .\nIn a 2020 article for the Center for Land Warfare Studies ( CLAWS ) , Bimal Monga discusses the benefits and risks of establishing such a force .\nIn terms of benefits , Monga says a rocket force would deter China from threatening India using conventional missiles , provide India with an option to inflict severe damage on an adversary , increase the cost of aggression against India , suppress Chinese airbases and missile launch sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide a quick-response counter-strike , and send a strong message to an adversary .\nMonga also discusses the risks of establishing a ballistic-missile force .\nHe notes that India lacks a well-formulated policy regarding the use of conventional missiles , the difficulty of distinguishing a conventional from a nuclear missile attack , the inability to reassure potential adversaries that conventional missiles will not threaten their nuclear forces , lack of destructive power to be a credible strategic deterrent , huge expenses involved in building a missile arsenal , and the potential to spark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan .\nNote
