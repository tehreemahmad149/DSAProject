Associated Propaganda, by Michelle Malkin", "content": "If nothing else , the past two years have demonstrated with blazing clarity how the ruling elites live by one set of rules and impose an entirely separate set of rules on the unfavored , ostracized , dispossessed and deplatformed .\nAs a member of the print , broadcast and internet media for the past 30 years , I can not emphasize enough how complicit so-called mainstream journalists are in perpetuating such double standards and stoking hatred of dissidents .\nThe Fourth Estate will spare no one \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not even the dead \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in its ruthless pursuit of absolute power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a widely disseminated hit piece by Associated Press investigative reporter Michael Biesecker published on Jan. 3 .\nHere \u2019 s the bias-laden title that reads more like an MSNBC op-ed whine than a straight news headline : Ashli Babbitt , as you may know , is the 35-year-old Air Force veteran and Trump supporter shot and killed by a Capitol police officer one year ago this week during the Jan. 6 \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d rally in Washington , D.C .\nThe fetid article under the fetid headline is victim-blaming at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the \u201c more complex story \u201d that the once-venerable AP wire service believes is so important for the public to know ?\nBabbitt was involved in a complicated personal love triangle , had \u201c bad blood \u201d with her husband \u2019 s ex-wife , faced \u201c numerous misdemeanors \u201d related to a traffic encounter with the ex , and then was \u00e2\u0080\u0094 wait for it , it \u2019 s buried deep down in the article \u00e2\u0080\u0094 acquitted by a judge of all the criminal charges .\nThe rest of Biesecker \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgruntled attacks against Babbitt by the still-seething ex-wife , plus extended point-and-sputter condemnations by the \u201c investigative reporter \u201d against Babbitt \u2019 s ideological stands and internet posts , topped off by resentful references to the fact that President Donald Trump and countless American citizens remain stalwart in their defense of Babbitt \u2019 s memory .\nThe AP makes a grand performative show of its commitment to fighting bias .\n\u201c We must be fair , \u201d its online statement on \u201c news values and principles \u201d asserts .\n\u201c Whenever we portray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must make a real effort to obtain a response from that person.\n\u201d Just to reiterate : Ashli Babbitt is dead .\nShe is unable to defend herself against the clearly calculated and anniversary-timed sliming and smearing by \u201c investigative reporter \u201d Biesecker .\nThat doesn \u2019 t seem to have bothered the AP ethics gurus one bit .\nBiesecker \u2019 s bio touts his status as a \u201c 2019 Pulitzer finalist , \u201d but his trashy piece of trash trashing Ashli Babbitt doesn \u2019 t even rise to the level of People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure manure .\nLook : We all know if Ashli Babbitt had been black and had been shot and killed at a Defund the Police rally , the AP ( which I \u2019 ve long said stands for Associated Propaganda ) would be ramming the martyr narrative down our throats instead of debunking it .\nBut because Babbitt and countless thousands like her were white Trump supporters , we \u2019 ve been bombarded with agitprop about how every single Jan. 6 protester was engaged in \u201c riot , \u201d \u201c siege \u201d or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grievance \u201d about election integrity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to borrow AP \u2019 s own simp words for BLM and antifa \u2019 s agendas \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is relentlessly framed as a dangerous \u201c conspiracy theory \u201d and \u201c misinformation \u201d instead of a legitimate concern .\nI remind you that it was the AP that issued \u201c stylebook \u201d guidelines four months after BLM and antifa set America on fire after the George Floyd incident ordering its journalists not to use the term \u201c riot \u201d to describe the mayhem because it \u201c suggests uncontrolled chaos and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c underlying grievance \u201d of black protesters against the system .\nThe AP pooh-bahs advised their minions to employ the kinder , gentler euphemism \u201c unrest \u201d to describe \u201c a condition of angry discontent and protest verging on revolt.\n\u201d I will also remind you that a year ago this week , the AP published a false story that then-President Trump had pressed a lead Georgia elections investigator to \u201c find the fraud \u201d and promised he would make the investigator a \u201c national hero.\n\u201d The AP was forced to acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made public two months later revealed that Trump did not say either \u201d and that it had \u201c erroneously reported \u201d the untruth .\nThe retraction came two months after the original lie was manufactured .\nThe power of the AP to deceive , defame and destroy can not be understated .\nThe organization , more than 170 years old , brags in its ethics statement that \u201c more than half the world \u2019 s population sees AP news content on any given day.\n\u201d Holier than thou as they commit their evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news \u201c accurately and honestly \u201d while spitting on the graves of patriots .\nAshli Babbitt , your sacrifice will not be forgotten .\nYour honor will be defended .", "author": "Michelle Malkin", "url": "https://www.unz.com/mmalkin/associated-press-associated-propaganda/", "published": "Tue, 04 Jan 2022 05:00:59 +0000", "published_utc": 1641290459,

he has been squirreled away and on what grounds he was transferred .\n\u201c For privacy , safety , and security reasons , \u201d I was told , \u201c the BOP does not discuss any individual inmate \u2019 s conditions of confinement to include housing quarters or reasons for transfer.\n\u201d This past Sunday marked four full months that Marty has been in solitary and blocked from communicating with loved ones or the media .\nI first learned of Marty \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years ago from his loyal and vigilant wife , Dana , whose words in defense of the dissident action he took that earned him a 10-year federal sentence have never left me : \u201c It was the right thing to do.\n\u201d A quick recap for those who have never heard of , or have forgotten , the \u201c Free Marty G \u201d nightmare .\nIn 2013 , a young girl named Justina Pelletier was ripped from her parents \u2019 custody by Boston Children \u2019 s Hospital .\nThe teen , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syndrome , had gone to BCH after coming down with a severe case of the flu .\nInstead of receiving top-notch care and attention at BCH , however , Justina was medically kidnapped and recklessly re-diagnosed with a psychological condition , \u201c somatoform disorder.\n\u201d Justina was dragged from BCH \u2019 s neurology department to its infamous psych ward , where she was reprimanded for being unable to move her bowels or walk unassisted in her weakened state .\nAt the Wayside Youth and Family Support Network residential treatment center where she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me in my 2018 documentary on the case , she was harassed by a staffer while taking a shower .\nThe physical and mental torture lasted 16 months .\nIn April 2014 , he helped lead a social media army that implemented distributed denial-of-service ( DDoS ) attacks against Boston Children \u2019 s Hospital and the nearby Wayside Youth and Family Support Network residential treatment .\nMarty had organized a social media army to knock the computer networks of both institutions offline to protest Pelletier \u2019 s medical kidnapping .\nHackers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participated in the campaign .\nMarty was charged and convicted of cybercrimes and sentenced to 10 years in federal prison .\nHe had already spent more than a year behind bars without bail at the time of his sentencing ( including about 80 days in solitary confinement and a stint in the same detention center as Mexico \u2019 s notorious drug cartel kingpin \u201c El Chapo \u201d ) .\nHe has no regrets about stepping up in Pelletier \u2019 s defense and continued his whistle-blowing investigative journalism after his imprisonment with Dana \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shut him up and shut him down after reporting on the plight of other CMU inmates .\nThe last time Dana spoke to Marty was last September .\nThe last time she was able to see him in person was at his sentencing three years ago \u00e2\u0080\u0094 yes , years \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this month .\nLast summer , BOP officials had recommended that Marty be removed from the Terre Haute CMU .\nInstead , he was hauled from one American Gitmo to another .\n\u201c We were devastated to find out that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue , \u201d Dana told me this week .\n\u201c There was never any good \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or even comprehensible \u00e2\u0080\u0094 reason to place him in that ultra-restrictive unit that was created in the 9/11 era .\nThe BOP \u2019 s decision to continue placing Marty in the CMU shows that the pattern of harassment and retaliation that Marty faced when he began speaking publicly about conditions in BOP facilities continues.\n\u201d Dana added that \u201c less than two-tenths of 1 % of federal inmates are held in the CMUs .\nMany of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe BOP has never given a reasonable explanation for why it has chosen to hold Marty , a nonviolent person never previously convicted of a crime , in these specialized prison units .\nI believe the BOP is continuing to retaliate against Marty for his decision to speak publicly about conditions in BOP facilities , ranging from damp and freezing cells , nonpotable water , to misconduct by a BOP unit manager.\n\u201d The Justice Department \u2019 s inspector general passed the buck on Marty \u2019 s case to the BOP Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaint has fallen into yet another black hole .\nIf
