about nothing , a comedic retort intended to ridicule the question about whether what she was doing was what she ought to be doing , implying as it did unwarranted criticism of a possible administration action or the lack of some possible action .\nWikipedia helpfully weighed in on Harris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really no such thing as circularity , since \u201c Taken as a whole , ( even ) dictionaries are circular because each and every word is defined in terms of words that are also contained within the dictionary.\n\u201d This argument was immediately refuted by the many critics of \u201c Wokepedia , \u201d who suggested that the authors of this \u201c explanation \u201d need to spend time re-reading the entry under \u201c sophistry.\n\u201d Other critics zeroed in on Harris

.\nThey argue that , even assuming there are \u201c things and tools \u201d useful for this purpose , some action beyond daily agreement would to be needed , for example , actually deploying said \u201c things and tools.\n\u201d But Harris supporters quickly rebutted the implied charge of inaction , saying that achieving correct and scientific agreement on things and tools was a necessary preparatory act in this time of bold and insistent misinformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also argued , were both \u201c things \u201d and \u201c tools \u201d and agreement on them was essential work .\nOther , quite unexpected comments have also been circulating on Twitter .\n# BenFranklin , one of five authors of the US Declaration of Independence , apparently felt called upon to interrupt his well-deserved eternal rest to remark that the noble tide of erudite and stirring political speech seemed to have quite ebbed , judging by this example of political speech , and now amounted to no more than a trickle , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promptly banned him back to his eternal rest .\n# DouglasAdams of \u201c The Hitchhikers to the Galaxy \u201d fame , counseled those confused by Ms. Harris \u2019 seemingly incoherent speech that it was time to forcefully stick their bright yellow Babel fish in their ears .\nAlthough , he admitted , that his own Babel fish appeared to be out of order on this occasion , as the translation of Harris \u2019 s words was no more intelligible to him than the original Vogon dialect that Harris often employs when rattled .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply to inquiries about his views on whether Harris \u2019 speech was mathematically circular , tartly asked : \u201c Is the set of all sets that are not members of themselves a member of itself ?\nThe question answers itself.\n\u201d After rudely asking who the hell Bertrand Russell was , most Twitter users unloaded on him with alphabetic ripostes like WTF , DUH , or the stupid face emoticon .\nThe Dutch Circularity Prize committee confessed itself in a tizzy after all the controversy over this year \u2019 s Escher prize .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ circularity as an art form , so we are dumbstruck at the attention our prize has garnered this year .\nOf course , we were dumbstruck before this , so very little has changed.\n\u201d Jen Psaki , besieged by clamoring reporters at her latest White House briefing , wanting to know the official White House position on what one called \u201c circularity-gate , \u201d first praised Ms. Harris \u2019 statement for its brevity and plain diction , but also

Brains Are Inferior - May Be Different Species", "content": "London , England - A study conducted over a 20 year period concludes that the brains of American Republicans are inferior , bordering on representing a different species .\nThe Cambridge University research project , a joint effort by UK and US scientists , discovered that Republicans simply do not have sufficient brainpower to understand even basic concepts considered by scientists to be \u2018 common sense.\n\u2019 The peer-reviewed study was published in both the American Journal of Science and the United Kingdom Psychology Review .\n\u201c To put it bluntly , \u201d said Dr. Eric Clyburn , \u201c American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity .\nTheir brains are significantly less developed than any other human brains .\nIn fact , these people may actually be a different species - at the very least , a subspecies.\n\u201d The study showed irrefutable proof that Republicans have remarkably limited ability to think .\n\u201c They lack basic reasoning and critical thinking skills , \u201d said Clyburn .\n\u201c A person with a normal brain can weigh evidence and consider differing points of view .\nRepublicans can not do that .\nThey really are simple-minded creatures like snakes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that concepts beyond their ability level are actually real , \u201d said Cambridge research scientist Dr. Sylvia Burch .\n\u201c In their simple minds , anything and everything they don \u2019 t understand must be fake or false .\n\u201c When presented with complex concepts , \u201d continued Burch , \u201c they can not wrap their limited brains around the information .\nPeople with functioning brains will ask questions and read up on a topic in an attempt to facilitate comprehension .\nThinking people may gain some level of understanding , or they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely valid , but beyond their abilities.\n\u201d \u201c The Republican will avoid any such deliberation , \u201d said Clyburn .\n\u201c They do this because they can not deliberate .\nThey will reject the information out of hand .\nThey do not have the ability to determine that concepts beyond their mental capacity exist .\nTheir limited capacity brain requires them to feel in control of their world , and so , they reject such information as false.\n\u201d The study found that Republicans are easily led by others who feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains why they idolize people like Donald Trump , \u201d said Clyburn .\n\u201c Trump and his ilk stoke their irrational fears , reinforce and validate their ignorance.\n\u201d \u201c It should be noted that Trump is an anomaly , \u201d said Burch .\n\u201c He does not possess critical thinking ability .\nHe isn \u2019 t consciously feeding into the base fears of his followers - he just spouts his inherent foolishness .\nBecause of a fluke , he happened to be in a position where millions latched onto him as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitch McConnell and Marco Rubio , for example , don \u2019 t have the \u2018 Republican brain , \u2019 \u201d said Burch .\n\u201c They are just two who capitalized on the sheer ignorance and stupidity of Republicans in order to win their support .\nRepublicans don \u2019 t have the brainpower to realize they are being duped.\n\u201d \u201c McConnell , Rubio , and others take advantage of this phenomenon , realizing that their path to power and control is in performing for this subspecies , \u201d said Clyburn .\n\u201c They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCarthy , Texas Governor Greg Abbott , Texas Republican State Representative Briscoe Cain , and many , many others.\n\u201d \u201c The scheme really is very simple , \u201d said Burch .\n\u201c McConnell , et al , ratchet up the fear and hate whenever they see the need .\nMcCarthy , Abbott , Cain , etc.\n, are willing , useful idiots , as it were .\nThe mindless drones - Republicans , that is - latch on , unquestioning and servile.\n\u201d \u201c That \u2019 s why the Republican subspecies buys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or enlightened , \u201d said Clyburn .\n\u201c Their feeble brains don \u2019 t allow rational thought.\n\u201d \u201c It is a serious problem going forward , \u201d said Burch .\n\u201c It \u2019 s like trying to reason with a snake or an alligator - it isn \u2019 t possible.\n\u201d \u201c The future looks grim for thinking people , \u201d said Clyburn .\n\u201c
