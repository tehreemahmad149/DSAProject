January Scotland generated 98.7 % of its electricity requirement and was also able to provide Wales with 50 % of its electricity and 14 % of what England required .\nThis was a period of peak demand .\nThe transfer of electricity to other parts of GB vary on different days and times .\nNone the less transfers south are a constant feature of grid management keeping the lights on in England .\nWe have constructed several tables of region and nation electricity generation mix and transfer in recent days .\nNorthern Ireland is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland is integrated covering both NI and the Republic .\nThere are interconnectors to enable electricity transfer to and from NI and Scotland and between Dublin and Chester .\nOther interconnectors enable the transfer of electricity to England from Norway , The Netherlands , Belgium and two from France .\nThe generation mix by region reflects that region \u2019 s requirement for electricity to meet that region \u2019 s demand .\nIt does not mean they are able to generate all their requirement from within their own power region .\nBoth Scottish power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable consistancy most of the time .\nWind is the major source of generation in nearly all GB regions and particularily signifcant in the North of Scotland and South of Scotland .\nGas is the main generation source in South Wales and the South of England , whilst Nuclear takes the leading role in South West England .\nHydro is a major contributor to power generation in the North of Scotland and North Wales .\nGeneration from Biomass ( wood pellets ) is a major generation source in Yorkshire .\nCoal makes an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English regions .\nThis next table looks at power transfers between Distribution Network Operators ( DNOs ) Only 2 regions in this period can meet their total electricity need through own generation , The North of Scotland and South Wales .\nAs we will show later on , the position in South Wales is complicated by their very large gas generation capacity .\nThe South of Scotland , in this table is drawing on the North for 27.9 % of generation but as part of network chain action , enabling the South of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions \u2013 NE 32.3 % NW 24.7 , N.Wales M 34.8 % , W.Midlands 24.2 % , Yorkshire 7.4 % and smaller percentages to 3 other English regions .\nAt 4.30pm last Wednesday when grid demand was quite high Scotland \u2019 s 2 Power Regions where sending electricity all the way down to Portsmouth .\nThe other noteworthy column is the amount of electricity imported from other European countries .\nFour of England \u2019 s regions are particularly dependent on other European countries NE 19.1 % , SE 24.2 % , London 19.8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9.8 % .\nMight be a good idea to keep on good terms with these European countries , especially the EU ones .\nBrexit will never bring energy independence .\nTables 1 and 2 also show carbon intensity data .\nBoth Scottish regions have very low scores compared to English and South Wales power regions .\nDifferent time periods can show different transfer patterns .\nWe looked at a different period where the generation from wind in North Scotland dropped closer to average GB levels and was replaced by a massive increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a giant clean water battery which at flick of a switch can send water tumbling through the turbines to meet a shortage from other renewables .\nThe North for this short period drew 7 % of requirement from South of Scotland nuclear .\nTable 3 covers a period of relatively low demand prior to the expected surge from 4.00pm onwards .\nScotland is drawing 5.6 % from Ireland which is on a separate all Ireland grid .\nFlows in either direction are common throughout the day enabling the Irish grid to send GB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Irish grid is short .\nThere is a reason why this happens .\nIrish windfarm developer Airtricity is a wholy owned subsiduary of North of Scotland distribution network operator SSE .\nSSE are maximising income from their Irish investment with the agreement of National Grid .\nThe big picture is Scotland is generating 94.4 % of generation requirement whilst supplying 5.5 % of England \u2019 s electricity which is a much much bigger market , vastly greater than the 5.6 % SSE has drawn from its Irish subsiduary to Scotland .\nEngland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its own generation capacity with a 2.7 % top up from Wales .\nWales is taking 18.6 % of power from Scotland .\nThis is not surprising as there is another Scottish connection in the form of an interconnector from Scotland to Chester and the fact that the DNO for North Wales and Merseyside is Scottish Power .\nIt is now 6.00 pm on New Year \u2019 s Day and these are the figures I tweeted yesterday evening and shown in the headline

Welsh electricity demand .\nEngland still getting 2.7 % of generation demand from Wales .\nThe South of Wales has massive generation capacity and normally supples much of what England needs , but it is dominated by gas generation and gas has become very expensive as anyone with a gas supply will be very aware .\nThere is a clear strategy to limit gas generation because of high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of GB householders with gas boilers not being able to switch on their heating because of supply constraint .\nIn Table 3 Wales is generating almost 30 % from gas but by 6.00pm peak time that is down to 12 % of generation .\nWales has no nuclear and the 7.3 % is from Scotland along with a big chunk of our renewables .\nDuring this peak time period England fails to generate even three-quarters of its electricity requirement .\nThe electricity grid covering England and Wales in owned by National Grid operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also own the GB gas network covering Scotland , England and Wales .\nThey also have significant interests in the US .\nNational Grid like SSE is a publically quoted FTSE 100 company .\nSo no public ownership .\nThe grid in Scotland is different and is owned by SSE in the North and Spanish owned Scottish Power in the South .\nThese are the companies that levy those grid charges onto our Scottish electricity bills .\nAlthough the Scottish electricity grid is owned by these two companies National Grid operates it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity bills Scottish renewable companies are charged for connecing to the grid whereas in Wales there are no charges .\nThe Scottish Affairs Committee has called for Ofgem to conduct a thorough review to overhaul this situation which disadvantages renewable developers in Scotland .\nWhat has happened to gas generation in Scotland ?\nAs we have reported in other articles in our Power Scotland series Scotland has one gas fired power station at Peterhead for which the UK government has yet to cough up the money for installing carbon capture .\nPeterhead is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the period we have been examining it is offline .\nThis would be another example of cost and gas saving to help England out with its high gas dependence , despite Westminster \u2019 s late conversion to wind generation .\nThe chart for 2020 shows Scotland increasing renewable output with a 14.2 % lower dependence on fossil fuels .\nThe small amount of oil generation is due to diesel generators in the islands that can be switched on in the event of grid shortage .\nWith the islands contributing massively to renewable @ @ @ @ @ @ @

energy prices this year is causing hardship for average and low income families .\nFor Scotland with a foot in both fossil fuel energy and increasing renewable generation means independence would enable us to manage the transition much better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so Scotland \u2019 s national energy advantages are shared to the benefit of the population and not to the total advantage of energy

rumblings in Scottish Tory ranks , contemplating it seems it may be time for a break with sleaze , cronyism and constant embarrassing u-turns by Johnson \u2019 s government catching them off guard Operation Arse it was called : the campaign to stop Boris Johnson becoming leader of the Conservative Party and Theresa May \u2019 s replacement as Prime Minister .\nThe Scottish Tory leader , Ruth Davidson didn \u2019 t think much of Johnson and gave her support in the leadership battle to Sajid Javid .\nOthers also believed Johnson wasn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shunning him in favour of support for Jeremy Hunt .\nJohnson \u2019 s stint as London Mayor and Foreign Secretary had not endeared him to them .\nBut , as happens in politics , roads to advancement and to cabinet positions ultimately bulldozed scruples aside and knees were soon bent to the new leader while warm words about his suitability and vote-pulling power followed when little more than six months later he won an overwhemming victory in the December 2019 general election .\nFew could carp at the 80 seat majority gained and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cake .\nMurdo Fraser \u2019 s call in the 2011 Scottish Tory leadership election for a separate Scottish party was buried when he lost out to Ruth Davidson .\nHer striking difference from previous Tory leaders , her high profile and popular promotion of the Tory cause was no time for radical change .\nThe 2019 80 seat majority cemented the belief it was worth ditching principles and hostility to Brexit , especially if it meant a foot up the slippery political ladder and an increase in salary .\nBrexit was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mattered were looked after .\nThe PR machine pumped into overdrive would champion the advantages , the UK \u2019 s strong position holding all the cards , all appeared front and foremost in print and broadcast media .\nAnd the Scottish Tories sailed along with it , their loss of seats in the 2019 general election when they plummeted from thirteen to six seats , with their vote down 3.5 % , caused only an insignificant ripple on the high tide water of that 80 seat majority .\nThen the realities of Brexit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scottish economy is being harder hit than much of the rest of the U.K .\nFarmers and fishermen already anxious as the realities of being out of the EU began to impinge on businesses and livelihoods , have been left reeling by impending trade deals with Australia and New Zealand .\nThese will allow imports of meat of standards lower than those in the UK at present , with acceptance of lower animal welfare standards .\nBrexit and Covid-19 have conspired to make life difficult for businesses of all kinds as EU nationals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the policies of the UK government , seasonal workers on which many food producers have for years depended have stayed within the EU , shunning the U.K. And this at a time when infection rates from Covid and Omicron are adversely affecting the number of people at work .\nWithin the U.K. attitudes towards Brexit have been slowly changing as more downsides of our departure become apparent , with a majority now believing the U.K. should not have left the EU .\nScotland , of course , voted overwhelmingly to remain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer the consequences of a life-changing policy we didn \u2019 t vote for , forced through by a government we didn \u2019 t vote for , and haven \u2019 t for well over fifty years .\nWith Tory support now sliding dramatically across the U.K. and with Scottish council elections in four months , Tories are now looking at their campaigning options .\nHostility towards independence and a dermination to fight it to the bitter end , and even beyond , has not changed .\nBut with the SNP still riding high in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unionists are becoming ever more desperate .\nThere have been calls for all unionist parties to work together at the next Scottish Parliament election to oust the SNP from government , though with an independence referendum having taken place and been won this could be pointless .\nOn the other hand if there is another \u2018 No \u2019 vote then such tactics could make more sense , burying the SNP and independence for generations .\nScottish LibDem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton would be up for that .\nRuth Davidon who initially said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , believing his type of premiership would alienate Scots and drive more towards independence .\nIn August 2019 Davidson resigned as Tory leader , ostensibly to spend more time with her family .\nMost believed this was code for anything to get away from bumbling Boris .\nBeing made a Baroness with a seat in the House of Lords has not stopped her berating Johnson , and recently this appears to have been ramped up with criticism over his policy for compulsory voter ID , condemnation over his dire speech to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his handling of partygate .\nOf all the events or policies that coud have stirred public fury it was the holding of parties in Number 10 and other government buldings whilst lesser mortals were unable to visit ill or dying relatives and were banned from contact with others .\nTo add insult to injury Johnson \u2019 s unfeeling and unthinking dismissal of these as work meetings or just a few colleagues having a drink after work infuriated the public and this ire has been seen in numerous opinion polls .\nIs a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the immediate future .\nAnas Sarwar has refused to rule out coalitions at council level with Tories to keep the SNP out of administration in many councils , as they already do .\nBut before coalitions can be forged seats need to be won and many Tories , furious or at least extremely uncomfortable at the sleeze and corruption uncovered in and around Number 10 , are now weighing their options , faced with a tsunami of losses reflecting their slide in the polls .\nAmongst these options is the resurrection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate Scottish Tory party .\nIn The Times Peter Duncan , former MP and Scottish Tory chairman said that , in the wake of Johnson and his government \u2019 s recent party problems and the handling of them , there was growing support for the idea .\nJohnson \u2019 s conduct is harming the Tory vote .\nThe chaos in Downing Street is holding back the party \u2019 s prospects .\nSTV also covered the story saying fiascos like the Owen Paterson debacle , Downing Street parties , and problems around Covid strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , and this is seriously hurting the Conservative cause in Scotland .\nThe National \u2018 s article referred to Andy Mciver \u2019 s piece in The Herald in which he claimed that the wave of Downing Street scandals \u2013 the Owen Paterson debacle , the Downing Street flat renovations , the loss of the by-election , the Peppa Pig speech and partygate ) were stoking the feeling of a separate party being advantageous .\nScottish Tories , he believed , were tired of being tied to the UK party \u2019 s fortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popularity , or otherwise , of the party at Westminster .\nMaciver is a media commentator and director of a PR consultancy who obviously thinks a Scottish party could have a better image and increased votes .\nSo what would a separate Scottish Tory party mean ?\nA separate Scottish Tory party would make it easier to distance itself from this sleaze and from policies MPs were required to vote for at Westminster but which are highly unpopular north of the border .\nThis could be done whilst still being attached in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to the Westminster party , voting with them on many major issues whilst providing Scottish Tories with much more say and leverage than at present on issues they aren \u2019 t so keen on .\nIf losing a vote in the House of Commons was at stake then Scottish Tory voices could have more say in shaping and implementing government policy .\nThen there is the thorny issue of independence .\nScottish Tories in the main are not about to change their minds on that but their campaigning stance might carry more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more believable if they were to espouse and demand additional real powers , perhaps even federalism which would give them and the LibDems ( perhaps even Labour ) a common platform .\nMembership of the single market , like Norway , might also be an option .\nNot only could such moves reharness those farmers disillusioned by their treatment at the hands of the Tories , they might also attract votes from those at present undecided on independence .\nThey could even draw to the fold those who are thinking of voting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course means that Scottish Tories would wholeheartedly have to embrace devolution , something they have been unable to do to date .\nFormer MSP and now the John Millar Professor of Public Law at the University oif Glasgow , Adam Tomkins has apparently said that no opposition parties in Scotland will get near power until they break free and divorce themselves from London .\nTomkins is presumably talking of parties and policies but his statement does have a ring of independence about it .\nIn April 2021 , Tomkins wrote an article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to define when UK constituent nations could hold independence referendums .\nSo the ramifications of Scottish Tories setting up a separate party , which would have to be done anyway once Scotland becomes independent , should be pondered by Tories as well as non Tories .\nIf the Scottish Tories grasp the separation nettle will that set the dominoes tumbling as Labour and LibDems follow ?\nWould the avalanche sweep Labour and LibDems along a similar path or would they stubbornly resist and cling on to Westminster \u2019 s coat-tails until the winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rethink ?\nHow would voter perception in Scotland be affected by all parties being Scottish parties , and with policies probably more in line with Scottish desires ?\nHow would this affect the campaign for indepenence ?\nThe political landscape has been fairly unchanged in Scotland for many years .\nAn upheaval , an earthquake may just be on the horizon .\nSupport fact-based journalism .\nThose who have already

not often there is a nuclear energy story that is a cause for celebration .\nHunterston B is a 46 year old nuclear power station on the Ayrshire coast .\nThe present operators EDF Energy have only been running Hunterston B for 11 years when they took over from the disaster that was British Energy .\nEDF with a large French portfolio of nuclear plants has considerably more experience of nuclear and the management of aging reactors .\nThe transfer to EDF was arranged during the period of the last Labour government under Gordon Brown .\nLike other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTamer Albishawi station director of Torness , Scotland \u2019 s last remaining nuclear plant , in an interview with Press Las Vegas said : \u201c I absolutely think we should take on more renewables energy \u201d Mr Albishawi believes offshore wind will be an important element of a low carbon mix .\nFrom Torness he can see boats going out to the area where EDF is developing the Neart na Gaoithe windfarm .\nHunterston has been generating nuclear energy since 1964 , almost 60 years , Hunterston A had two Magnox reactors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reactors 1 an 2 came online in the first half of 1964 .\nReactor 2 shut down on 31 December 1989 and Reactor 1 on 31 March 1990 .\nNow it is the turn of Hunterson B , both Reactors 3 and 4 are ageing AGR reactors that have suffered from increasing cracks in their graphite cores .\nConstruction of the Hunterston B plant began in 1968 , with power generation at Reactor 3 starting in February 1976 and Reactor 4 starting March 1977 .\nHunterston B was brought online and operated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limited liability company owned by the British government .\nIn 1995 ownership of Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear was transfered to a private company British Energy which was taken over by France \u2019 s nuclear specialist EDF in 2009 at a cost of \u00a312.5 million .\nEDF has operated and maintatined Hunterston B since .\nHunterston B Reactor 3 was taken offline on 26th November last year leaving just Reactor 4 which is due to be taken offline tomorrow , Friday 7th January 2022 .\nNuclear plants have the ability to adjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grid .\nGas fired power stations or plentiful availability of pumped hydro-electric power can also be used to meet sudden shortfalls from other generation sources as we have previously reported .\nBoth Hunterston B reactors had extended outage periods whilst maintainance and thorough inspection of their graphite cores was undertaken .\nA limit was placed on permitted output when the reactors restarted .\nReactor 4 produces 492 MW \u2013 until tomorrow .\nEDF use Reference Unit Power ( RUP ) to define output which in the case of Hunterston B was 985MW for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,190MW before 2007 .\nA quick look at the history of electricity privatisation The process was started by the Thatcher government with the introduction of the Electricity Act 1989 .\nThe first in line was the Central Electricity Generating Board ( CEGN ) which was split into three companies ; Powergen now owned by German energy company E.ON , National Power which ceased to exist in 2001 and was partly taken over by Innogy SE , then owned by another German energy company RWE based in Essen .\nIn September 2019 German \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in a complex assets swap deal .\nAnother part of National Power also has a European dimension , first becoming International Power and now owned by Engie Energy International , a multinational energy company headquartered in Newcastle upon Tyne .\nIt is a wholly owned subsiduary of Engie SA a major French energy company based at La D\u00e9fense , Courbevoie in the \u00cele-de-France .\nThe final company spun out of CEGN was the National Grid Company now simply National Grid , a FTSE 100 company , also listed on the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion and an equity value of \u00a319.56 billion .\nThe point about this \u2018 diversion \u2019 isn \u2019 t that we are in anyway opposed to the involvement of European companies in our energy systems but simply to point out that London \u2019 s preoccupation with things being British in Thatcher \u2019 s day and still today in Brexit Britain is not reality in a global world or the Europe Scotland seeks to rejoin where there are great opportunities for Scottish renewable developers .\nThe collosal irony of Thatcher \u2019 s privatisation agenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector resulted in significant opportunity being presented to two major German and two major French utilities to take big stakes in UK electricity generation .\nFor UK nuclear to end up with \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France S.A , 84.5 % owned by the French state \u2013 out of the hands of one government and into the hands another is an extraordinary outcome .\nMeet \u2018 Global Britain \u2019 .\nScotland and France are old allies so we are relaxed about EDF winding up nuclear generation in Scotland .\nTorness : the last Scottish nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to decommission in 2023 but that was extended to 2030 .\nEDF recently announced that it would now decommission in 2028 by which time the expansion of offshore wind and Scotland \u2019 s considerable further potential for hydro-power will be filling the gap .\nTorness Reactor 1 came on stream in May 1988 and Rector 2 in February 1989 meaning the latter has now been in operation for 33 years .\nTorness like Hunterson is an AGR station and increasingly prone , over time , to develop cracks in the graphite cores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u201c We carry out inspections of the graphite cores every time we take the units offline for maintenance .\nTo date , we have not observed any keyway root cracking though we know all AGR stations , includng Torness , will develop it as they approach the later part of their operating life .\nWe will continue to inspect the reactors regularly.\n\u201d Although EDF is best known as a generator of nuclear power it has a wider generation portfolio .\nIn the UK EDF has a portofolio of 37 wind farms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short of 1GW .\nIn Ireland it has an onshore wind and solar development of almost 1GW and a 50 % stake in the offshore Codling Wind Park project which will generate up to 1.5GW .\nEDF says it is focusing most of their renewable plans in Scotland , \u201c as public policy and wind conditions are more favourable to onshore wind development.\n\u201d it opened a new office in Edinburgh in 2017 which has helped take forward more than 1.5GW of wind power in planning and development .\nEDF currently has 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually with other partners .\nEDF is an international company with energy projects around the world .\nThe bulk of its nuclear stations are in France where nuclear generation has supplied up to 75 % of France \u2019 s electricity .\nThis is now falling towards 50 % as EDF \u2019 s French plants are also now ageing with many in an age range between 33 to 50 years .\nEDF renewables is a major player in wind which is now its biggest growth area .\nOver the last 15 years it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries with an installed or under construction worldwide capacity totalling 9,993MW .\nEDF also has a significant solar portfolio in Europe , North and South America , Midddle East and Asia .\nEDF currently has 1 offshore wind project , Neart na Gaoithe wind farm , off the coast of Fife with consent for up to 54 turbines with a 450MW capacity capable of powering up to 391,000 homes .\nConstruction began in 2020 and is expected to complete by 2023 .\nNeart na Gaoithe is 19 kilometres north-east of Torness Power Station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to see the blades turning offshore for a number of years to come .\nNOTE : A shunt reactor is a reactive power absorber that improves the system \u2019 s energy efficiency .\nIn long high-voltage transmission lines and cable networks , it is the most compact device for reactive power adjustment .\nWho deals with the long-term nuclear legacy ?\nAs mentioned earlier EDF will be responsible for defueling both reactors at Hunderston B. EDF explained to us \u201c Defueling , which is when we take all the nuclear fuel out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sellafield for processing and safe storage , will be carried out by EDF and will take around 3 years .\nThe site will then be handed over to the NDA [ Nuclear Decommissioning Authority ] and its subsidiary , Magnox , who will carry out the rest of decommissioning , which includes deconstruction .\nThe timeframe for this stage will be determined by Magnox \u201d Sellafield is a wholly owned subsiduary of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority .\nFrom Friday nuclear generation in Scotland will be reduced by 985MW , half of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTorness has a current output of up to 1190MW so nuclear generation in Scotland will be reduced from 2175MW pre Hunterston 1 and 2 shutdown to 1190MW , amounting to 55 % of previous nuclear capacity .\nAs an illustration of the huge change in the source of electricity generation in a 15 year period ( 2004 \u2013 2019 ) coal went from 29 % of generation to zero , nuclear generation in Scotland fell by a third , by which time wind was accounting for 41 % of generation producing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gas more than halved .\nHave a look at this link showing the vast number of nuclear generation plants around the world .\nNuclear generation is not going to end anytime soon .\nThat Scotland is now down to just one last operational nuclear power station is someting we can be extremely proud of due to massive renewable expansion under the Scottish government in recent years .\nMore extraordinary is this has been achieved despite the fact energy is not devolved to Scotland .\nFriday is a day to raise a glass to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition .\nThey deserve our thanks for keeping us safe .\nScotland is well on the way to becoming \u2018 world beating \u2019 in phasing out nuclear generation .\nWe will have a follow on exclusive report on the nuclear legacy in Scotland as soon as I get a chance to write it up .\nSupport fact-based

civil servants whose primary duty is to the elected government of the day , irrespective of what their own political leanings may be or whether they believe or approve of the policies being implemented .\nBut what happens to the integrity of the civil servant tasked with actions and policies that break the law ( as with the illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 when both English and Scottish high courts ruled it illegal and by implication that the prime Minister had lied to the Queen ) ?\nMoreover the courts made clear that the proroguing was instituted merely to stop scrutiny of Brexit .\nHow should a civil servant react when strategies destined to willfully deceive the public are introduced ( as in the case of Brexit ) ?\nIs remaining silent in the face of wrongdoing the right approach or does that make civil servants complicit in the wrongdoing ?\nAnd what about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide impartial advice to their parliamentary representatives on which they can then act ?\nAlexandra Hall Hall also raises the Internal Market Bill introduced in September 2019 which \u201c one of his [ Johnson \u2019 s ] ministers openly acknowledged in the House of Commons would break international

any institutions which counter its narrative or try to hold it to account \u2013 parliament , judiciary , NGOs , human rights experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberals , and others .\nMost sickening of all , she

"title": "Nuclear Decommissioning: Chapelcross a timeline", "content": "Following on from a previous article on Hunterston B which was shut down last Friday I decided to have a look at one of the smaller nuclear power stations in Scotland to see how work was progressing on decommissioning .\nChapelcross nuclear power station occupies a 92 hectares site on the location of a former World War II training airfield in Annan .\nChapelcross had 4 Magnox reactors , each with a 48MW output .\nChapelcross was linked to sister plant Calder Hall in Cumbria which is now the site of the NDA \u2019 s Sellafield operation .\nCalder Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBoth plants were originally operated by the UK Atomic Energy Authority .\nTheir main purpose was to produce weapons-grade plutonium although they also generated electricity for the National Grid .\nThe four cooling towers at Chapelcross were demolished in 2007 .\nCooling towers were common in early nuclear plants and similar to those for coal and wood pellet power stations in Yorkshire .\nThe reactors are spent-fuel free and the building is currently partly demolished .\nThe defuelling work on the 4 reactors was completed in February 2013 , nine years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of decommissioning is carried out by Magnox Ltd a subsiduary of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority ( NDA ) The NDA is a regulatory authority , a Non-Departmental Public Body ( NDPB ) , created as a result of The Energy Act of 2004 .\nThere are three main levels of nuclear waste that have to be deal with when a nuclear power station is decommissioned .\nThese are the classifications as described , mainly , by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority .\nHigher Activity Waste ( HAW ) includes High Level Waste ( HLW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all radioactive wastes ( by volume ) are in the HLW category .\nHLW is produced as a by-product from reprocessing spent fuel from nuclear reactors .\nSpent nuclear fuel is sent to Sellafield .\nHLW typically occurs in liquid form and a process called \u2018 vitrification \u2019 converts the liquid HLW into a solid product .\nThe vitrification process is also carried out at Sellafield .\nAlthough accounting for only for only 1 % of waste by volume High Level Waste accounts for up to 95 % of radioactivity from a nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the really long \u2018 shelf life \u2019 .\nIntermediate Level Waste exceeds the upper boundaries for Low Level Waste but does not generate a significant amount of heat but enough for it to need time to cool .\nAbout 6 % of all radioactive wastes ( by volume ) are in the ILW category .\nThe major components of ILW are nuclear reactor components , graphite from reactor cores and sludges from the treatment of radioactive liquid effluents .\nNDA use a system of \u2018 packaging \u2019 to contain , store and handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above ground in specially constructed units for a period of 120 years .\nSo long after the power plant building has been demolished .\nLow Level Waste ( LLW ) contains relatively low levels of radioactivity , not exceeding 4 gigabecquerel ( GBq ) per tonne of alpha activity , or 12 GBq per tonne of beta/gamma activity .\nMost LLW comes from the operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities .\nThe waste includes items such as scrap metal , paper and plastics .\nSome smaller amounts of LLW also come from hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all radioactive wastes ( by volume ) are in the LLW category .\nMost Low Level Waste from across the UK has been disposed at the Low Level Waste Repository ( LLWR ) in Cumbria since 1959 .\nWaste was initially placed into landfill-style trenches but is now grouted ( cement fill ) in metal containers before being stacked in concrete lined , highly engineered vaults .\nA cap will cover the containers when the vaults are full .\nIn the North of Scotland , the Dounreay site also has a new LLW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid waste from Dounreay site operations and the nearby Ministry of Defence \u2019 s Vulcan Naval Reactor Test Establishment .\nThe NDA have a fourth disposal category for Very Low Level Waste .\nThey describe this alternative as : Alternative Disposal \u2013 Permitted landfill sites can accept some Very Low Level Waste ( VLLW ) alongside non-radioactive wastes .\nThere are strict controls on the amount of radioactive waste that can be disposed of at regular landfill sites .\nThis indicates the state of play as at 1st April 2019 .\nChapelcross had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to Sellafield .\nAt that point , almost three years ago , the Intermediate Level Waste as well as LLW had still to be dealt with .\nThe VLLW would appear to be close to the end of the decommissioning process .\nThe LLW is destined for containers in Cumbria and the estimated 4,900 cublic metres of Intermediate Level Waste will be left onsite in specially constructed containers for a period of 120 years , pending a Scottish Government decision around 2145 on disposal of the containers and contents .\nThe interim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Chapelcross began 2014 and was completed by May 2021 when the first \u2018 package \u2019 was placed in the facility .\nIn announcing this progress Magnox Ltd and the NDA said in a news release ; \u201c The Interim Storage Facility ( ISF ) can hold over 700 waste packages of four different approved package types , and will be filled over the next five years as part of decommissioning work .\nStanding at 57m long and 23m wide , it has been constructed to safely and securely store packages for 120 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LLW ) is sent off-site for treatment and disposal , the purpose-built ISF [ Interim Storage Facility ] will securely store all the ILW on-site until such time when the Scottish Government decides on disposal of the ILW interim storage facility and contents .\nIn the case of Chapelcross that will be in 124 years time in 2146 .\nThe site will need to be continually monitored during that period .\nThe process at Chapelcross started in 2004 with defuelling and with Higher Level Waste sent to Sellafield , followed from 2021 with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is due to complete in 2026 .\nThe storage facility is then sealed for 120 years when a decision will be made by the Scottish Government on final disposal of ILW storage and contents .\nWhilst it can be argued that the core decommissioning work will take around 22 years , the end game is still 120 years away making 144 years in total for final clearance at the site .\nThe situation in Scotland is different from England and Wales Although energy is controlled by Westminster , planning and environment come under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotland \u2019 s higher-activity radioactive waste policy was set out in January 2011 .\nChapelcross operated for 44 years .\nThe ILW will remain on the site until 2146 although the buildings will be long gone by then .\nIt is essential we deal with the legacies of the past and do so to the highest possible standard because we owe that to our own and future generations .\nThe question for policy makers is do we really want to contemplate building new nuclear power stations when the legacy will be with future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half times beyond any new nuclear plant \u2019 s operational life .\nThe cost of nuclear electricity generation is high and future costs of dealing with the legacy are also passed on to at least four future generations .\nThe Scottish Government has decided no new nuclear plants will be built in Scotland .\nAt the present time only one new nuclear plant is currently approved and under construction in England .\nWhen they were planned and built back in the 1950s people were told the electricity would be so cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity bills .\nWell we know how that turned out .\nThe Higher Level Waste at Sellafield will be stored in perpetuity in specially constructed containers .", "author": "NEWSROOM", "url": "https://newsnet.scot/news-analysis/nuclear-decommissioning-chapelcross-a-timeline/",

than one other person outdoors .\nThe party needs to be seen in this context at a time of massive restrictions , escalating deaths , and the Cummings scandal about to break .\nOthers have questioned

20th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 30-40 in attendance , some questions still need answers : \u2022 PM Why was the invitation sent out for the event by his Principal Private Secretary , stating the gathering was to take advantage of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks ?\nSounds very like a social event .\nTo quibble over calling it a party is to indulge in silly semantics .\n\u2022 Why if it was a work event were those invited asked to bring along booze ?\n\u2022 If it was a work event why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ?\nIf it \u2019 s work you have to be there , particularly if it \u2019 s government work .\n\u2022 Why was the invitation couched in the terms \u2018 we \u2019 and \u2018 us \u2019 ?\nWho else was Martin Reynolds referring to if it wasn \u2019 t his boss , Boris Johnson ?\n\u2022 If it wasn \u2019 t Johnson being referred to might it have been his partner Carrie Symonds ?\nCarrie is said to be fond of a good party .\n\u2022 Can Johnson \u2019 s PPS send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party in the gardens of 10 Downing Street without first securing the permission of his boss and PM , Boris Johnson , who claims it is his garden although used for government and official state events .\n\u2022 The official Number 10 website puts the number of people working in the Downling Street complex in 2007 at 170 .\nSo going by that figure or one slightly higher , the invitation must have been sent to around half of those working there .\nIt seems inconceivable that Johnson heard nothing about a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially a party in his own back garden , to which over half his staff had been invited .\nSurely there was talk ?\n\u2022 The story being punted is that the PM , stretching his legs after a tiring time in front of his desk , wandered from his office to thank staff for their hard work and merely stumbled across the event , surprised to discover food laid out and colleagues quaffing booze they had brought along .\nUnperturbed by the lack of laptops , notebooks , official papers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tables , the booze , the illegal nature of the event , and his partner comfortably esconced in an armchair , Johnson assumed it was a work event , and plumped himself in a chair beside his partner , his PPS and Dom Cummings and joined in .\n\u2022 Did Johnson not think to ask why so many of the Number 10 staff were gathered in his garden , eating , drinking and enjoying themselves , believing implicitly it was a work event ?\nEspecially when gatherings of more than two people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 25 minutes Johnson now admits he was there , relaxing , enjoying a drink , did it never cross his mind that this was wrong and that others were suffering while he , his partner and staff partied ?\n\u2022 Where was Rishi Sunak from whose balcony the photo below was believed to have been taken ?\nInvited ?\nRefused ?\nElsewhere ?\n\u2022 If drinking when working either within or in the garden of Downing Street is deemed acceptable then surely this should be a cause for concern .\nWhen serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our leaders sober , not half cut .\n\u2022 Did the fact this was the end of the parliamentary session and the start of the Whitsun recess prompt the desire to celebrate by a BYOB party in the warmth of a May evening ?\n\u2022 There have been reports on Twitter of staff being told to wipe their phones of anything pertaining to the \u2018 party \u2019 before the investigation began .\nOthers have pointed out that this is tampering with evidence and therefore a serious offence .\n\u2022 Why didn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , say he was wrong and apologise instead of dragging out the expos\u00e9 .\nSuggests Johnson can \u2019 t admit to being wrong .\nOr perhaps indicates he believes he can do as he likes and always get away with it .\nThe work event excuse obviously hadn \u2019 t been circulated to all MPs as Tory MP Simon Hoare told Sky News his understanding was the Number 10 party in question ( that phrase \u2018 in question \u2019 suggests there were others ) was to thank Dominic Raab for deputising whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covid-19 , and to welcome Boris Johnson back to work .\nThis may be so , but it \u2019 s not the reason given in Martin Reynolds email .\nThis comment also suggests Raab was at the party but others have said he was elsewhere at the time .\nOdd .\nIt also suggests the Prime Minister knew about it , otherwise why organise a party if he had another engagement and wouldn \u2019 t be able to attend ?\nIn a report in the Mirror , the Prime Minister \u2019 s Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor saw an email from his PPS Martin Reynolds inviting more than 100 staff to the event , nor had the PM asked Mr Reynolds to send the email .\nMartin Reynolds remains in his job , and of course has the Prime Minister

does not change the agenda , and for how long the clown should remain is the question the Tory party is grappling with .\nDo they need him for a bit longer to be the fall guy ?\nOr do they need to act

difficulties in these circumstances .\nThe English party is dominated by the hard right and removing Johnson will not change that .\nAny reset will merely be window dressing to get through to re-election by 2024 .\nAccusations by Rees Mogg of Douglas Ross being a lightweight rather rebound on the present Westminster Government with many present UK ministers falling easily into the lightweight category .\nWhat of Johnson himself ?\nIs he really a heavyweight political figure .\nHe has survived in the past and might do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of time .\nBeing a lucky survivor does not make Johnson anything other than a lightweight .\nWe think that is how history will judge him .\nJohnson is an asset to independence That is why Tories in Scotland are wringing their hands .\nThey know they will have a fight on their hands if London decides to impose hard right-wing unionism .\nThere is a realisation that Scotland voting for independence would be a blow to Global Britian \u2019

model with a handy string of offshore tax havens .\nStarmer is totally signed up to Brexit .\nHe is moving the Labour party to the right , drawn by the rightward march of Johnson .\nThe Labour party in Scotland remains staunchly unionist and bound hand and foot to Westminster .\nThe only way Scotland can become a prosperous and socially just country is through independence and returning to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe , when a PM goes that triggers a general election .\nThe UK malleable constutution allows the Prime Minister to be changed without a general election which gives the Tories some space to consider timing .\nThey did well at local elections four years ago so would already have been expecting losses .\nConservative councillors are very nervous but there seems a possiblity that the Tories will hope for a slight recovery before May with many adopting a wait and see approach .\nDanger is that conservative voters may not turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier to vote for another party because it is not a general election .\nThere are lots of difficulties ahead with huge increases in energy prices , introduction of higher National Insurance charges , fraught negotiations with the EU they can not win and increasing difficulty in importing essential goods .\nIf Johnson survives Sue Gray , as widely predicted , he might just make it to at least May .\nSpeaking of the other May , she was the PM who risked a general election when she had a 20 % poll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweep her aside because she underestimated both Corbyn and the impact of her struggles with the ERG .\nA recent 10 % Labour lead does not look daunting enough at mid-term , but the situation is very fluid so it remains to be seen if the Tories at Westminster can hold their nerve .\nJohnson has apologised to the

there was the disgraceful bouncing , smirking response whilst Ian Blackford spoke in the House of Commons of the 150,000 plus people who had lost their lives to Covid 19 .\nFirst the feeling was that Johnson was done for , had reached the end of his tortuous prime ministerial road .\nThat he and the culture he had spawned was finished \u2013 a culture in which Johnson believed he could get away with anything , could elicit donations for redecoation , expensive holidays , taking people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s parliamentary democracy and welfare state .\nThe Teflon Tory who just laughed off criticism , burbled excuses and was believed by so many because he was a nice guy , wasn \u2019 t he \u2013 one people could relate to .\nDifficult to believe but\u2026 The abject apology in the Beth

indicated to many that he knew he would survive the little problems at present besetting him .\nPlus of course there \u2019 s the troubling question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most likely , but many are aware Sunak wouldn \u2019 t go down well in the red wall seats the Tories are desperate to retain .\nLiz Truss has been working hard behind the scenes in an effort to persuade fellow MPs that she

whitewash , with the UK government refusing to commit to publishing the evidence .\nIt was therefore anticipated that Johnson would bounce back and Partygate would be swept under a convenient Downing

Alex Thomson , Chief Correspondent of Channel 4 News , set a match to the heather .\nPeston tweeted : \u201c I understand Sue Gray has found the email from a senior official to PM \u2019 s principle

he had advised the PM that the party should not go ahead but thought he had .\nNever mind evidence , assurances will do Then came the tweets from Alex Thomson explaining why the Met was refusing to

scorned and angry politicians must surely score highly .\nThis morning Tory rebel MP William Wragg , a Brexiter who was in favour of Johnson resigning , made a statement as Chairman of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee claiming ministers are blackmailing Tory MPs planning to remove Boris Johnson , and that rebels are facing pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of damaging publicity .\nHe makes accusations of breaches of the ministerial code by threats to withdraw money from constituencies and to leak stories about individual rebels .\nWragg says that the reports of which he \u2019 s aware would appear to constitute blackmail and urges anyone threatened to go to the Police .\n[ Presumably the Met Police who\u2026 well , see above ] Wragg is a also joint Vice

was \u201c not aware of any evidence \u201d for Mr Wragg \u2019 s allegations .\nHowever one rebel MP apparently told the BBC that some MPs had been threatened with funding cuts , whilst an impending reappraisal of parliamentary boundaries had also been used to stifle rebellion .\nThe new Labour MP , Christian Wakeford , who deserted the Tories yesterday , also weighed in .\nAccording to BBC North West Wakeford backed up William Wragg \u2019 s allegations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying he was assured plans for a new high school in his constituency could be scrapped unless he voted a certain way .\nA certain way presumably being in support of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister .\nA name mentioned in bullying allegations is the government chief whip , the Rt Hon Mark Spencer MP .\nThe Government Chief

limited data , yet enough to show a great deal of work needs to be done and that can only be spearheaded by the Scottish government who are working again on preparations ahead of introducing the

YES , 35-54 are 59 % Yes and 55+ are down to 32 % YES .\nBreakdown by region shows where Yes need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal more .\nIn Central region Yes leads by 4 % on 52 % .\nIn Glasgow , Yes are on 61 % and even higher in Highlands and Islands on 65 % and take the lead in Lothians with an 8 % advantage at 54 % .\nMid Scotland and Fife gives No a narrow 2 % lead on 51 % .\nIn the remaining 3

despite his problems he is determined to cling on .\nWhy so concerned by one remark ?\nSo Sunak is seen as a threat to Johnson and his supporters .\nBut why are they so concerned by one remark that

the present incumbent ?\nSunak \u201d s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Hindu Punjabis though born in Kenya and Tanzania respectively .\nTheir parents had migrated from India .\nBoth families then swapped East Africa for Southampton where Rishi \u2019 s mother and father met .\nRishi was educated at some of the best schools \u2013 not Eton but Winchester College , the fees for which are more than most

comfortably off compared to many .\nSunak has been described by supporters as calm , organised and immaculately dressed .\nEmpathy and compassion are not mentioned .\nInstead of emotions he lists policies .\nThis lack of feeling is considered by some a product of boarding schools for boys where , to survive , personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be suppressed .\nAfter Oxford where he is remembered as a Thatcherite , a Eurosceptic and president of the Oxford University Investment Society , Sunak worked for four years ( 2001-2004 ) for Goldman Sachs , leaving to do a business degree at Stanford University , where many he met greatly influenced him .\nFrom that Sunak moved to becoming a hedge fund manager in London , a partner at the Children \u2019 s Investment Fund ( TCI ) where the

said he entertains the constituency membership here with summer parties at which champagne and nibbles are served by uniformed staff .\nSo a step up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has spent money to manage his public image , to imbue his image with more of that compassion and empathy he is said to lack , giving him a warmer , more cuddly persona .\nAccording to the article in OpenDemocracy , Jonathan Dean , an associate professor of politics at Leeds University , commented that politicians draw on tactics from the world of celebrity influencers , partly because they can mask their political views .\nThis referred to Sunak , but it may be even more applicable to Johnson .\nSunak \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help offset spiralling fuel bills has not gone down well , and shows a lack of empathy for those faced with a choice of heating or eating while the Chancellor muses how to spend time in his other homes \u2013 reportedly a \u00a37m , five bedroom house in Kensington in London , a flat in Kensington said to be kept for visiting relatives , and an apartment in Santa Monica , California .\nNor does the guarded and quiet Sunak play the parliamentary game .\nHe has been very quiet about

the Centre for Policy Studies ( CPS ) , and Policy Exchange .\nHe cited restrictions being economically damaging when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 and has consistently argued for diluted covid restrictions .\nAgain from Tatler : Concern can be felt by some in Downing Street that he may have grown too popular and too important .\n\u2018 There are those who hate him , as he \u2019 s now unfireable , \u2019 said one MP .\n\u2018 There are many who don \u2019 t like the fact another power base is emerging.\n\u2019 But back to the bets .\nThis is a telling paragraph from the Tatler article .\n\u2018 If we \u2019 ve lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future of the party.\n\u2019 And therein surely lies the worry behind the \u201c I wouldn \u2019 t have said it \u201d remark .\nIf Sunak , the guy whose bets in his

other existing facility is Devonport where they are already working through a \u00a31 billion upgrade on facilities .\nDevonport is the largest naval dockyard in Europe and whilst being reconfigured

believes that Scotland will require 3 , building to 5 frigates , to adequately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint exercises with our European partners .\nWhether Babcock might be in the running for those contracts

organisation , These Islands , that because Scotland has more energy than it needs it needs the people of England to help consume it .\nThat is not an argument for the union , as the audience clearly understood , but an argument for Scotland \u2019 s energy exports .\nEurope is a much bigger market anyway and something These Islands fails to comprehend .\n\u201c Scotland is blessed with enormous renewable resources but it \u2019 s not blessed with a great many people , and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to harness Scotland \u2019 s renewable resources is to look at it from a UK wide perspective .\nScotland \u2019 s got all the renewable resources but the rest of the UK is going to use that electricity so the problem is better tackled at a UK wide level.\n\u201d Sam Taylor , Chief Executive of these Islands Well , when you \u2019 ve picked your chin up off the ground after reading that quote you might be wondering who These Islands is .\nAccording to its website : \u201c These Islands is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction that no crisis should be allowed to go to waste .\nIt stands unabashedly for the view that more unites the three nations of Great Britain than divides them , and that good relations between the various communities of Northern Ireland , Great Britain , and Ireland are all the more important to work for in the wake of Brexit.\n\u201d Apart from Sam Taylor , other leading figures are Kevin Hague ( Chairman ) , Jim Gallagher , and archaeologist , writer and broadcaster Neil Oliver .\nIts Chief Executive Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolio manager with The Portand House Group Pty Ltd before taking up the position with These Islands in July 2017 .\nThe Portland House Group Pty Ltd is one of Australia \u2019 s largest Private Funds Management Groups , said to be a sophisticated investor in the global markets .\nPrimarily trading in equities , it also has activities in fixed income , external funds , currencies and their derivatives .\nSo according to Sam Taylor Scotland can \u2019 t be independent as it has an embarassment of renewable resources .\nA surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil and gas , is seen by unionists as a \u2018 problem \u2019 , one too complex for poor little Scotland to deal with .\nSo how does that work in countries like Saudi Arabia , a country of around 32 million people that produces more oil than it can use ?\nIt doesn \u2019 t feel the need to allow a more populous country , for example nearby Egypt with 102 million of a population , to take Saudi oil and decide what should be done with it .\nSaudi Arabia exports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy .\nScotland produces much more whisky and salmon than it could possibly consume .\nBut manufacturers don \u2019 t go running to the UK government asking if they will help them dispose of it .\nScotland sells these products around the world , renowned for the high quality of our food and drink .\nSo why should we need the UK government to tell us what to do with our excess renewable energy ?\nScotland \u2019 s surplus energy is a commodity like manufactured goods and food and drink products , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to England , to Norway to connect with Norwegian hydrogen for onward export to Europe .\nGermany is interested in using our renewable energy as hydrogen .\nDespite the recent huge hike in gas prices , prices for renewable energy , from which Scotland already generates 98 % of its own electricity demand , has for some time had prices below the wholesale price of electricity .\nPrices for wind , solar , and tidal have hardly moved .\nAccording to an article in Energy Voice by Dick Winchester , a former subsea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government on the energy transition : \u201c Scotland could go a long way to solving this problem by taking a lot of renewables off grid , not connecting a large part of the ScotWind and future project capacity to the grid but using it instead for hydrogen production.\n\u201d Winchester goes on to argue that Green and Blue Hydrogen could then be used to displace natural gas and oil for heat , transport and for \u201c export to Europe to help them displace Russian gas faster.\n\u201d But the pace of hydrogen production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government .\nUsing our renewable resources in this way makes strategic sense as it would solve \u201c our own Net Zero issues and by exporting the excess we can help wean our friends in Europe off Russian gas.\n\u201d Scotland \u2019 s already onto it There are positive signs for Scotland \u2019 s renewables with the initiation of an ambitious international collaboration project that could unlock access for Scottish firms to a multi-billion pound green hydrogen market .\nAt the end of last year Scottish Enterprise launched a scheme , led by industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the public sector , to explore future export opportunities for Scotland \u2019 s green hydrogen .\nCalled \u2018 Scot2Ger \u2019 , the project is also backed by Scottish Government , Highlands and Islands Enterprise and South of Scotland Enterprise .\nAnother Energy Voice article reports that Scottish Power , a subsidiary of Spanish energy giant Iberdrola , Wood , KPMG Germany and DS Consulting will lead the initiative to \u201c examine the emerging and substantial German demand for zero-emission hydrogen and how it could be met by green hydrogen produced in Scotland.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow substantialy over the coming years , by 2030 estimated to form the majority share of a European hydrogen import market considered to be worth around \u00a317 billion .\nThe Scottish Government \u2019 s hydrogen assessment in 2020 concluded that if Scotland exported green energy to Europe , it could yield \u00a325bn in gross value added .\nThis would be in addition to an increase of more than 300,000 jobs by 2045 , \u201c building on Scotland \u2019 s renewable energy capacity and enabling workers to transition.\n\u201d This project and others are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become a leading hydrogen nation domestically and internationally.\n\u201d Like our near neighbour Norway , Scotland is perfectly capable of following this strategy on its own , without the help of the UK \u2019 s broad shoulders which now look increasingly hunched and bowed as they battle the blizzards of isolation .\nSam Taylor \u2019 s laughably ridiculous ( audience laughter can even be heard on the video ) assertion that Scotland can \u2019 t be independent because of a wealth of renewables is nothing more than a poor joke , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries with vast resources don \u2019 t give these resources away for nothing .\nThey develop them , export them , creating jobs , making profits that help those countries become great places to live and work .\nAn independent Scotland \u2019 s resources will be well

although I had been a contributor for much longer .\nI sense a movement gaining momentum in the months to come as preparations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to place before the people of Scotland .\nNewsnet will

unknown", "content": "Molly Pollock takes a deep dig into a journey into the unknown that The Union represents in this weekend \u2019 s big read Politicians , commentators and posters have for years urged Unionists to make their positive case for the Union .\nHowever some of us came to the conclusion years , maybe decades ago that there is no such case to be made .\nNevertheless we expect our Unionist friends to attempt to spin together crumbs to feed to the faithful , particularly when local elections are in the offing and an independence referendum is on the horizon .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotland has grown increasingly amorphous , a structure we had tried to pin down previously but given up on .\nBut given recent events thoughts have again turned in this direction .\nWe need to prod it , question it , demand this union be defined , its supposed benefits , its shared values , for it seems clear that politicians as well as voters are unclear on exactly what Union our Unionists want to preserve , want Scotland to remain part of .\nIs this uncertainty why they too are having trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nRecently there has been much talk about the gap in political thinking and direction opening up between Scotland and England .\nSome years ago it might have been regarded as a fiction of Nationalist imagination , of people anxious to heap reason upon reason for independence .\nBut this is certainly no longer the case .\nBoris Johnson \u2019 s right-wing government has scuttled ever more to the right towards isolation as Scotland has dug in to the centre left with a widespread desire to rejoin the EU .\nSo Unionists are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitched to an authoritarian kleptocracy .\nThe England of the green and pleasant land , of good old British values , has lurched off into the sunset , and instead England has wrapped itself in a cloak of exceptionalism , within a bubble of superciliousness and arrogance , if the House of Commons and social media are anything to go by .\nThe past has gone and can not be revived .\nNo amount of resuscitation will bring it back to life .\nSo we either opt for a Westminster government as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it threatens to be in the future .\nA chilling thought .\nIf Scotland has changed since the referendums of 2014 and 2016 , then so has England , where the signs are that further change is brewing in its cauldron , and not necessarily changes that will be brought about through the ballot box .\nThis may appear a fanciful remark , but the signs are that deep unrest is simmering , thickening with bile , beneath the surface of English society .\nThis is having the effect of rendering some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirations in Scotland for independence .\nEngland is not a united country .\nThe north feels deeply alienated from the south and from London , one of the reasons the so-called Red Wall seats voted Tory and for Brexit .\nThey were desperate for change , whatever the cost .\nMuch of England feels ignored by London and the knowledge of London receiving the lion \u2019 s share of public finance for infrastructure and prestige projects rubs salt into the wounds of ordinary people struggling under Westminster government-imposed cuts .\nLondon and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicely , most agree , but an overwhelming feeling comes across that the rest of Britain will continue to struggle , feeling ever more isolated from the seat of power .\n\u2018 All in this together \u2019 cuts no ice .\nAt one time suggestions were mooted that London should be floated offshore , that it should become a city state and leave the rest of the UK to get on with living , possibly under a federal system , unskewed by the City .\nOccasionally Scotland gets a mention , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media posters now expect Scotland to go its own way and good luck to it .\nWe bottled it last time but the belief is that this time will be different , Brexit giving us the additional impetus .\nInitially , an elected dictatorship was the favoured description of Boris Johnson \u2019 s government .\nEither that or it being described as a hopeless government propped up by a hopeless bunch of opportunists .\nNot a democracy , but a government run by a small but influential clique of Bullingdon Boys in hock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money .\nNow the rhetoric has become more blunt .\nA kleptocracy .\nFascist .\nThe murmurings are turning weightier .\nLondon ( now often referred to in this context as Londongrad ) has been deemed the money laundering capital of the world .\nWhereas small countries like Latvia are taking legal steps , prosecuting people and freezing assets , there have been no prosecutions in the UK .\nIndeed the influx of Russian money and where it goes \u2013 a substantial amount straight into Tory party coffers , has been welcomed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted UK citizenship .\nAccording to Business Insider 14 ministers in Boris Johnson \u2019 s government and two MPs on the Intelligence & Security committee received donations from individuals and companies linked to Russia .\nBecause of his links to Moscow , the PM Boris Johnson was considered a serious security risk when Foreign Secretary .\nBrexit was about weakening the EU , not strengthening the UK .\nBrexit was about protecting the money flooding into London and those involved with it , and to ensure the UK could remain the laundromat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As well as money , Russia-linked donors were given access to senior ministers in exchange for cash .\nWhy , unless to influence UK government policy ?\nThe close Russian links fuelled Tory determination for London to become Singapore on Thames whilst these connections , financial and political , to Moscow have earned notoriety around the world .\nIn 2020 , Johnson gave a peerage to Evgeny Lebedev , overruling officials to do so .\nLebedev , who owns the London Evening Standard , which backed Johnson \u2019 s re-election campaign for London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian oligarch and former KGB agent .\nHe also owns The Independent and the TV channel London Live .\nLebedev is now styled as \u201c Baron Lebedev , of Hampton in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames and of Siberia in the Russian Federation \u201d .\nWhilst Putin flexed his muscles warnings came from the US that Russian money is now so entrenched in London and the City that retaliations against Putin would be severely compromised by the UK \u2019 s reliance on Russian money .\nJohnson not the only one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson who has encouraged this flow of dirty money .\nAs an article in the Byline Times says : \u201c Johnson , Theresa May and David Cameron welcomed the widening flow of Russian money and influence into the UK with open arms\u2026 In 2011 , Cameron expanded the so-called \u2018 golden visa \u2019 scheme , which allowed Russian oligarchs \u2013 and their money \u2013 to flood into London.\n\u201d Introduced by Labour in 2008 , the tier 1 investor visa scheme allowed people with at least \u00a32m in investment funds and a UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along with their family .\nFor a \u00a32m investment a visa took five years to acquire .\nA \u00a310m investment shortened the waiting time to two years .\nHome secretary , Priti Patel , ended the scheme earlier this month to help reduce the flow of so-called dirty money .\nOver 12,500 golden visas are said to have been issued whilst those fleeing for their lives across the Channel from conflict have been deterred from entering the UK .\nBut , despite the ending of the golden visa and despite international condemnation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t look as if much will change on that front , with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss insisting the Tories will keep Russia-linked donations totalling \u00a31.93 million .\nThese donations , collected from three individuals since Boris Johnson became party leader , have been \u2018 properly declared \u2019 insists Truss .\nIn 2019 , parliament \u2019 s Intelligence/Security Committee looked into Russian interference in the UK and its attempts to interfere in the 2016 EU Referendum .\nJohnson played down the threat , and delayed the report , tried to suppress it , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brexit .\nWhen the Government finally permitted Parliament \u2019 s Intelligence and Security Committee to release its report it made clear that \u201c the Government had not even bothered to investigate Putin \u2019 s attempts to interfere in British democracy.\n\u201d Stewart Hosie MP speaking for the Intelligence and Security Committee on the Russia report which was ready for publication several months previously but effectively suppressed by Johnson who failed to sign it off prior 2019 UK election .\nThe report can be found here .\nThe signs have been there for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take back control rhetoric of the Brexiters , the regaining sovereignty claptrap , and allowed control to fall into the waiting hands of Russian oligarchs .\nHe who hold the purse strings\u2026 This week the UK government announced sanctions against Russia .\nThese were seen to be weak and minimalist , far short of what the EU and the US announced .\nHave the close links between Johnson , his government , the Tory Party , the City of London and Russia , resulted in their response to Russian aggression being fatally compromised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain thrilled to ?\nThe party of law and order Then there \u2019 s Partygate when Number 10 employees partied at numerous events whilst others obeyed the lockdown rules and laws of Johnson and his government and mourned the loss of loved ones without being able to say their goodbyes .\nUnder such circumstances the lack of democratic accountability irks even more , becomes personal .\nBoris Johnson , Prime Minister and leader of the party that believes it stands for law and order , broke his own rules and allowed others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go down in history as the first British PM to be questioned under caution by the police .\nYet Conservative MPs don \u2019 t bat an eyelid .\nIndeed they line up to support him in the House of Commons and TV studios .\nFrustration and disillusion over Russian money and interference , Partygate , and the Covid 19 handling , as well as austerity and the rising cost of living , is spawning an appetite for a change of direction , the political system is increasingly regarded as failing England badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any change happening in the near future , or suggestions on how it could be brought about .\nThe Tories won \u2019 t vote for electoral change , nor will Labour or the LibDems .\nSo detestation of government , anger , disillusion , depression even hopelessness and despair rule .\nSome are blaming the first past the post electoral system for their woes , advocating that if anything is going to change the democratic deficit must be addressed .\nBrexit went ahead despite a minority backing it , and the English majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelmingly to remain , was dragged out without any consideration as to the damage it would do .\nIs guilt , too , now lurking there amongst the electorate ?\nAn unacknowledged shame at being conned in the Brexit referendum by the very politicians many are now railing against ?\nCompare this with Scotland where we are test driving a number of PR systems which have brought about a radical shift in politics , an SNP government and councils , with the Labour Party having lost its hegemony in local government following the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems aren \u2019 t perfect , but they do make an attempt to reflect the preferences and feelings of Scots .\nWe have a government with ambition and vision , driven by the desire to see all those living in Scotland fulfill their potential and everyone living here can feel they have a part to play in it , a vote that is meaningful , engendering pride and hope for the future .\nSo , back to the need for the Unionists to portray a positive case for the retention of the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many column inches to it , nor has the BBC given discussion of the subject much airtime .\nScotland long ago dismissed the Tories .\nThe Lib Dems signed their own death warrant when they went into coalition with the Tories at Westminster .\nLabour has been immersed in digging a hole to Australia , or else is floundering , unable to portray itself as a party with any stance worth voting for .\nCertainly Labour fortunes have improved recently in opinion polls , though the feeling is that this is due more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The likelihood of Labour in Scotland experiencing any kind of wondrous revival prior to a referendum is pretty close to zero .\nThough Labour activists are still capable of making a nuisance of themselves with their twisted nonsense .\nBut they , like the Tories are caught on a cleft stick , having severe doubts and concerns about the policies and personalities of their UK parties , voting one way at Westminster to keep their whips happy and the opposite way at Holyrood because they couldn \u2019 t possibly be seen supporting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe old avuncular Conservatism has long gone , replaced by a brutish ideology in which only those in power , their friends and well-connected matter .\nThe social contract has been abandoned in favour of the me first and only doctrine where the more vulnerable are being treated as expendable .\nDivergence between Scotland and England is not a Nationalist fantasy but a fact .\nThe chasms are obvious , and growing .\nAgainst this background a positive case for the Union is no longer enough , even in the unlikely event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now demand from the Unionists a definition of the Union they wish Scotland to belong to .\nCome our referendum , Scots need to be aware their choice is not just between independence and the Union as it was pre 2014 or even post 2016 in all its rosy nostalgia , the choice is now between independence and a union with a right-wing , Brexited , isolationist England with which we have even less in common .\nThe Unionists must be asked to define that new union and asked for a roadmap of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now undoubtedly more of a leap of faith , a journey into the unknown , to contine with an England that is changing dramatically day by day than it is to opt to follow a well-trodden path of nations to the normality

But everybody does the same.\u201d", "content": "Molly Pollock takes a look at who Volodymyr Zelenskyy , President of Ukraine really is .\nA President who told his people you are all President now .\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy , President of Ukraine , was born to Jewish parents on 25 January 1978 in Kryvyi Rih , which was at that time in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic .\nHis father was a professor and head of Department of Cybernetics and Computing Hardware at the Kryvyi Rih Institute of Economics while his mother was an engineer .\nOften described by some in recent days , as if to diminish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comedian and actor , Zelenskyy has a law degree from the Kryvyi Rih Institute of Economics , now part of Kryvyi Rih National University .\nIn December 2018 , on his New Year television show , Zelenskyy announced his candidacy for the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election running against sitting president Petro Poroshenko , a Ukrainian businessman and politician who served as President from 2014 to his defeat in 2019 .\nZelenskyy was a political outsider who had attracted attention and support , making him a frontrunner in opinion polls for the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 73.2 % of the vote in the second round , Surely an astounding win .\nHe has positioned himself as an anti-establishment , anti-corruption figure .\nPerhaps his years pursuing comedy in his own production company , Kvartal 95 , gave him an understanding of how to reach people , empathise with their feelings ( unlike the UK \u2019 s Bullingdon Boys from their elite schools ) , and give voters an understanding of the kind of person he was .\nKvartal 95 produced films , cartoons , and TV shows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow and touring around post-Soviet countries .\nBetween 2015 and 2019 one of these shows was the popular Servant of the People , in which Zelenskyy actually played the role of President of Ukraine .\nPart of Zelenskyy \u2019 s speech at his inauguration on 20 May 2019 \u2018 In a March 2019 interview with Der Spiegel , Zelenskyy stated he went into politics to restore trust in politicians and that he wanted \u201c to bring professional , decent people to power \u201d and \u201c would really like to change the mood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as possible.\n\u2019 As President , Zelenskyy has been a proponent of e-government .\nHe has striven for unity between the Ukrainian-speaking and Russian-speaking parts of the country \u2019 s population with hs communication style heavily utilising social media , particularly Instagram .\nZelenskyy \u2019 s campaign to unseat the sitting President , Petro Poroshenko , was almost entirely virtual , conducted over three to four months .\nInstead of engaging through the lens of mainstream media he communicated directly with the electorate through social media channels and YouTube videos .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disastrous way of campaigning , without the usual opinion-forming photos splashed across print media and photo opportunities and slogans the main course on broadcast media .\nBut Ukraine has a broad scientific and educational base with a reputation as a major technology region .\nUkraine has been ranked as the third best place in the world for people with advanced tech and IT skills .\nOver 100 R & D centres of major global companies are located in Ukraine , with , in 2017,13 Ukrainian companies listed in the top 100 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practice of hiring an external service provider to deliver some of the IT projects and functions required by a business unable to fulfill these with internal resources .\nUkraine has become a major outsourcer .\nOutsourcing services are most often provided in the area of Information Technology ( IT ) , but they can also cover logistics , marketing services , recruiting , accounting , processing and information systematisation , medical services , administration , and others .\nUkraine has become a top outsourcing destination and is reported to be the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a European leader in artificial intelligence outsourcing companies .\nSo with this expertise , and an online presence voters were accustomed to and comfortable with , it \u2019 s little wonder that Zelenskyy almost totally confined his campaigning to social media rather than chasing what in the UK would be considered the normal PR routes of newspapers and broadcast media .\nThis approach is at odds with the UK where social media is increasingly used but where traditional PR opportunities and photo opportunities are still cherished and widely sought .\nForeign Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine did so under a meaningless photograph of her against a background of the UK and Ukraine flags taken , not by a mobile phone camera , but by a professional photographer .\nForget Ukraine .\nAll that is being promoted by this photo is the image of Liz Truss , potential replacement for Boris Johnson .\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson , keen to voice his support for Ukraine and to show his empathy with the fighting by Ukrainians in the streets of their cities , had a photo posted of himself standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel in RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire .\nThis was a far cry from the Ukrainian front line .\nApparently Johnson was there to thank military personnel for their support to Ukraine and NATO .\nNo one could quibble with that .\nBut that \u2019 s not how ardent supporters of the Prime Minister saw it .\nIn a PR driven government there always has to be in-you-face PR angles .\nFor Johnson and his supporters this was a top level photo opportunity , in the belief that the Russian invasion of Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a butterfly from a chrysalis , of a more serious Prime Minister , a photo opportunity that allowed his Churchillian leadership qualities to be displayed after the Partygate debacle .\nBut with Putin now putting his nuclear deterrent forces on high alert , it will take more than a few posed photographs

swift and decisive actions that need to be taken to preserve our democracy .\nThe introduction to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Soviet state institutions unravelled in the 1990s , opportunities arose for the elites of the successor states to profit individually from the transfer of Soviet-era assets .\nThe ensuing wealth transfers have provided much business for British professional services firms .\nBut the provision of these services to post-Soviet kleptocrats and their associates has undermined the integrity of important UK institutions and weakened the rule of law.\n\u201d It \u2019 s long been known that British politicians had been receiving large donations from Russian oligarchs , some also enjoying other benefits such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Chatham House to publish a paper on kleptocracy in the UK was seen as significant .\nFourteen ministers in Boris Johnson \u2019 s government and two MPs on the Intelligence and Security committee received donations from individuals and companies

people/entities with close links to the state \u2019 .\nThis is the abuse of high-level power to benefit the few at the expense of the many , causing significant harm to individuals and society , the subversion of political office for personal enrichment and advantage .\nKleptocrats gain from the system through their close political connections and status and by a lack of institutional oversight and accountability .\nThe paper differentiates between kleptocrats who are are usually government officials , senior officials or a close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a member of the country \u2019 s business elite or a close family member , lacking formal power but sometimes with political influence .\nWorking through global networks they effectively mix illicit funds with legal ones .\nIn the post-Soviet period there was a seizure of private assets and the creation of what is known as the \u2018 shared treasure \u2019 .\nThe lines between the state ( especially the security services ) , private business and criminality became blurred just as these countries were consolidating their domestic institutions .\nDuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a protection for those lower down the chain who sent money upwards in a system that resembled that of an organised crime structure .\nThen , during the following decades these single sources of income were diversified through new domestic and international investments , wealth management and integration with international capital markets .\nIn making these diversifications they exploited the opacity of this capital and continue to do so .\nMoney is hidden through a variety of trusts , shell companies and bank accounts with structures \u201c \u2018 layered \u2019 through multiple jurisdictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , owned by a British Virgin Islands ( BVI ) company , in turn owned by a Liechtenstein trust ) and utilize nominee \u2018 proxy \u2019 owners and directors , with the aim of obstructing political rivals and any would-be investigators \u201d .\nThough the proceeds of these can be spent on legitimate , personal items , this is not always the case .\nThe Chatham House paper cites what was known as the Azerbaijani Laundromat scandal where $ 2.9 billion was channelled through four UK shell companies over a two-year period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobbying activities , including the bribing of European politicians .\nThe paper covers reasons why the UK is a key hub for post-Soviet elites such as exiled former insiders to under-the-radar representatives of regimes still in power \u2013 who settle in the UK .\nIt also looks at what the UK provides in terms of professional services in residency by investment ( golden visas ) and property to meet the demand from these elites for places to hide and spend their dubious wealth .\nIt looks at political influence , corrosion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK is exposing itself to possible influence from those who retain allegiance to kleptocratic regimes .\nThe Tier 1 ( Investor ) scheme , the golden visas , provided residency in the UK , and ultimately British citizenship , for over a thousand members of elites from post-Soviet kleptocracies .\nThe UK government failed to realise the money-laundering and security risks that this scheme presented .\n\u201c According to the NGO Spotlight on Corruption , 6,312 \u2018 golden visas \u2019 \u2013 one-half of all such visas ever issued \u2013 are being reviewed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office.\n\u201d Between 2008 to 2019 , only 9 per cent of \u2018 golden visa \u2019 applications were rejected , compared to 42 per cent of asylum applications .\nIn October 2015 , a report by Transparency International UK commented that it was \u2018 highly likely that substantial amounts of corrupt wealth from China and Russia have been laundered into the UK \u2019 through the Tier 1 scheme .\nYet it was only this week due to pressure over the Russian invasion of Ukraine that the scheme was closed down by the Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper lists 99 known purchases of UK residential property by politically exposed persons and high-risk individuals from post-Soviet countries , 1998\u20132020 .\n\u201c We argue that the UK has a kleptocracy problem .\nThe country \u2019 s international reputation has already been undermined by the inflow of suspect capital from the servicing of post-Soviet elites .\nBeyond this question of image , there are serious questions to consider of the integrity of the UK \u2019 s public institutions and the equitability of its laws .\nEfforts must be made to recover Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply on moral grounds , but because the fairness and efficiency of the country \u2019 s rule of law are at stake.\n\u201d Unlike most of the mainstream media , funded by foreign billionaires , right-wing plutocrats and kleptocrats we run on a shoestring and it is a bit frayed .\nWe know things are tough for everyone not in the top 10 % but small donations help keep us going , digging out the \u2018

\u2018 It is not just the oligarchs either .\nThe arrival of Russian money has resulted in a growth industry of enablers \u2013 lawyers , accountants , estate agents \u2013 have all played a role ,

the first of a 4 part series Molly Pollock looks at the issues surrounding the monarchy and the diversity of views on the Monarchy \u2019 s relationship with Scotland after independence .\nAccording to the Telegraph : \u2018 The Queen is to make a permanent move to Windsor Castle after not staying at Buckingham Palace for two years .\nThe 95-year-old monarch has been \u201c working from home \u201d at the Berkshire castle since the pandemic began.\n\u2019 So the 775 room palace in London , currently undergoing a \u00a3369million refurbishment which is due to be completed in 2027 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windsor Castle , the largest inhabited castle in the world and the longest-occupied palace in Europe .\nAccording to Wikipedia , as of 2006 , around 500 people were living and working in the castle .\nSo more like a small town than a cosy wee home .\nQueen would remain as head of state after independence , Ian Blackford says .\nCue furore on social media from independence supporters .\nThe Queen \u2019 s heirs and successors are her son , grandson and great grandson .\nMale heirs .\nSo for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a queen in sight .\nThe retention of the monarchy at least initially in an independent Scotland has always been SNP policy .\nFirst we vote for independence and get our new state set up with a shiny new constitution and then we can look at other areas such as the monarchy .\nThe most recent opinion poll on the matter suggests people in Scotland would probably vote to keep the British monarch as head of state after independence .\nThe poll ( 21st June 2021 ) conducted by Panelbase for the Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults would vote to keep a royal head of state , 35 % would favour an elected head of state , with 18 % unsure .\n78 % of Tory voters favoured keeping the monarchy , as did 67 % of LibDem voters and 62 % of Labour voters .\nInterestingly , and what might cause a few problems for the SNP , only 28 % of SNP voters favour keeping the monarchy after independence .\nPerhaps unsurprisingly support for the monarchy was strongest amongst the over 55s than with younger voters .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to lead to dictatorship .\nOthers point out that our present system has seen a flaunting of parliamentary rules with the rule of law challenged : this enabled by an unwritten constitution and parliamentarians too willing to toe the party line to safeguard advancement and re-election prospects , or strong-armed into line by party whips .\nWhether we opt for a monarchy or presidential system what is crucial is a strong written constitution , a proportional respresentation voting system to ensure a minorty can not rule the majority , and a parliamentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of law , placing the good of their constituents and country before that of party or personal gain .\nVoters who take an interest in politics , carrying out their own research and asking questions , not allowing themselves to be swayed by rhetoric and meaningless slogans would also be beneficial .\nAs would a press and media that believed in reporting events , probing and questioning rather than promoting their own agendas and conning the gullible who fail to read beyond attention-grabbing , intentionally provocative headlines .\nHow the monarchy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Civil List funding of the monarchy .\nEach year the Queen is given a payment by the government .\nLast year this was \u00a385.9m .\nThis payment is used by the Queen and other members of the Royal Family to pay for official royal duties .\nIt also covers the upkeep of occupied royal palaces : Buckingham Palace , St James \u2019 s Palace , Kensington Palace , the Royal Mews and Royal Paddocks at Hampton Court , and Windsor Castle .\nA thought-provoking list of British royal residences can be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on the profits of the Crown Estate , a property business owned by the monarch but run independently , controlled by a management board whose main duty is to maintain and enhance the value of the properties \u201c for the benefit of the nation \u2019 s finances \u201d .\nSo high property prices and returns benefit the Crown Estate and therefore the monarchy .\nUsually the Sovereign Grant comprises 15 % of the Crown Estate profits from the previous two years , the rest going to the government .\nHowever it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive 25 % for the next 10 years to help fund the \u00a3369m refurbishment of Buckingham Palace \u2013 a palace the Queen now no longer intends to live in .\nThe Crown Estate is not the private property of the Queen .\nIt belongs to the monarch for the duration of her/his reign .\nThis means the Queen can \u2019 t sell the Crown Estate or keep the revenue for herself .\nThe Queen also has significant private income , as do other Royal family members .\nThe costs of security for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metropolitan Police .\nCrown Estate Scotland The position regarding Crown Estate Scotland differs from England and Wales .\nSince 1830 when King William IV revoked the income from the crown estate in Scotland no monarch since has received income directly from the hereditary land revenues of the Crown in Scotland .\nCrown Estate Scotland , one of the main recommendations of the Smith Commission and established as part of the Scotland Act 2016 , is a public corporation belonging to the Scottish Government and responsible to Scottish ministers who appoint the board members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to corporation , income or capital gains tax , with the revenue profit paid to the Scottish Government Consolidated Fund and used for the benefit of taxpayers .\nSuccessive monarchs have revoked their rights to income from Crown Estates in Scotland but ownership remains in the name of the Crown .\nFull fat or skimmed milk monarchy ?\nSo what kind of monarchy will Scotland remain part of \u2013 at least in the short term as a government in an independent Scotland is likely to hold a referendum on whether Scotland remains a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut that \u2019 s for the future .\nA monarchy does not need to remain cast in stone .\nThere are different types of monarchy , like those in the Scandinavian countries which are more pared down , more figure heads , compared to the British monarchy .\nA slimmed down version might be a possibility for the future , particularly with austerity and rising costs .\nIn the present Queen \u2019 s platinum jubilee year it seems an appropriate time to look back and perhaps to look forward a little .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed in the UK and the world

.\nTimes have changed in Elizabeth \u2019 s seventy year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK and the rest of the world .\nThe coronation caught the imagination of people , impoverished and depressed by years of war

the coach and horses could be found in pride of place on display cabinet shelves in homes across Britain .\nThe route to the Abbey was lined with sailors , soldiers , and airmen and women from across the British Empire and Commonwealth .\nIn all just under 30,000 took part .\nThe Royal website tells that Westminster Abbey has been the setting for every Coronation since 1066 .\nThis of course is only true for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own site where monarchs were crowned \u2013 by tradition at Scone Palace in Perthshire .\nLooking back , the entire coronation ceremony appears to have been based on

1296 the Stone of Destiny was plundered by Edward I as spoils of war and taken to Westminster Abbey , where it was fitted into Edward \u2019 s wooden chair on which most subsequent English and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legend also has it that this is not the original stone but a sandstone stank cover substituted by the Scone monks on hearing of the approach of Edward \u2019 s army .\nThe stone Edward went off

students repatriated the Stone , travelling down to London by car \u2013 400 miles in the freezing cold as cars then had no heaters .\nIn the process of removing the Stone it broke into two pieces .\nThe larger piece returned with the students to Scotland , roadblocks successfully evaded , with the smaller piece arriving later .\nThe Stone of Destiny was repaired by Glasgow stonemason Robert Gray whilst a huge police search was underway .\nThere was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circles as George VI was very superstitious about it .\nBut it was never found .\nHowever on 11th April 1951 the Stone was left

Stone was not , in fact , the one repatriated by Ian Hamilton and his friends .\nHearts for a few months had beaten faster in Scotland , whether stank cover or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite the searches ,

handcuffs The UK Government says its furious at P & O Ferries \u2019 action in sacking with immediate effect 800 of its crew members , conveniently forgetting that just five months ago a bill to end the practice of companies firing and then rehiring on worse pay and conditions was scuppered by Paul Sculley , Junior Business Minister talking until time ran out for the bill .\nThe bill , a private members bill sponsored by Labour Brent North MP Barry Gardiner , had widespread support from opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whilst saying they opposed such actions , believed legislation was the wrong way

statutory footing .\nAccording to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 % of firms using fire and rehire were making a profit .\nThe procedure had been used by British Gas earlier this year .\nIn June 2020 , Gavin

and reduced terms and conditions .\nThe bill did not survive its second reading .\nSo two attempts in the last 21 months to put the procedure for firing and rehiring of employees on a statutory basis and both failed due to lack of government support .\nNow P & O Ferries has taken action firing 800 crew members by video , not even in person .\nBusloads of replacement crews waited at quaysides ( so P & O was firing but not rehiring ) whilst some crew members , who refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were legally entitled to be , were bullied out by handcuff-trained staff of a private security firm some of whom wore balaclava masks and brandished tasers .\nThis is said to be a copy of a leaked email sent to staff of the security company .\nA Union leader questoned when the government first knew about the mass sacking and asked why they had done nothing about it .\nOthers on Twitter questioned the timing .\nIf the company had time to organise replacement crews then it had time to provide existing crews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been aware of this and kept quiet ?\nThe union to which ferry crews belong is the RMT which wasn \u2019 t in favour of the EU so persuaded its members to vote against it and its employment laws which protected them .\nNow the RMT is up in arms and determined to demonstrate outside the Tory Party Conference in Blackpool .\nSo whilst P & O crews in the UK have been sacked , crews in France and the Netherlands have been spared .\nUK crews , presumably because of the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the butt of the company \u2019 s decision to reduce staff costs by 50 %

these public services .\nIt takes the current constitutional arrangement as given .\nSo no matter what is said about Scotland \u2019 s current fiscal position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the Union .\nEven so , there are those who rail against the figures , many of which are estimates .\nRichard Murphy , a British chartered accountant and political economist , has a video about GERS which is worth watching .\nUnder devolution Scotland receives a block grant from Westminster , and must balance its budget , though in recent years has only been told how much it will receive after its budget has had to be finalised .\nThe Scottish Government is now allowed to borrow a small amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 only that of the chancellor and his ultra Thatcherite politics .\nEngland has no block grant so just dips it \u2019 s fingers into the U.K. till for its spending money .\nDoes that suggest a Union of equals ?\nScotland \u2019 s so-called block grant , is a return to Scotland of some of the monies raised in Scotland through taxation .\nThe Barnett formula is used by the UK Treasury to calculate the annual block grants for the Scottish Government , Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Executive .\nIt therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services such as healthcare and education in the devolved nations .\nThe formula was first introduced ahead of the 1979 general election by the then Labour chief secretary to the Treasury Joel Barnett , whom the formula is named after .\nIt was initially intended as a temporary solution for determining funding allocations between the UK \u2019 s nations , but has remained in use ever since .\nMoney is often spent and attributed to Scotland without discussion with our devolved Parliament .\nThis is not a federal set up nor is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s not the best of both worlds , it \u2019 s the most unsatisfactory , particularly now that the UK Government is determined to undermine the devolution settlement and override the Scottish Parliament , taking back powers .\nScotland wants control over the money it raises and doesn \u2019 t want another government we didn \u2019 t vote for and whose policies we do not support , spending on our behalf , often for items or policies we do not agree with .\nSo instead of being able as an independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are having them made for us , decisions which are not always appropriate to the direction Scotland is taking or to what is best for the people who live in Scotland or its economy .\nFar from world-beating Global Britain , the UK significantly underperforms compared to other northern European states .\nData from the UK , ONS , EU and OECD all show falling standards of living and quality of life in the UK compared with our neighbours in northern and western Europe .\nThe Nordic countries recovered from the 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still has to factor in the horrific damage Brexit is causing to the economy and livelihoods .\nAccording to the Spring Statement 2022 UK GDP grew by 0.9 % in August-October 2021 compared to the previous three-month period ( May-July ) .\nThis compares to growth of 2.2 % in the Eurozone in Q3 2021 .\nThe volume of UK retail sales decreased by 0.6 % , house prices increased by 10.1 % in the year to October 2021 and GfK \u2019 s Consumer Confidence Index , which measures consumer attitudes , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an encouraging state of affairs .\nEconomically , under the Union , Scotland fares slightly worse in some figures but often slightly better than many areas of Engand .\nThe UK figures are significantly skewed by the figures for London and the south-east where companies tend to be headquartered , where the financial sector has a big effect , and where spending on infrastructure has been concentrated .\nThe number of businesses is low in Scotland , a reason why there is emphasis on this with the formation of the National Manufacturing Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 20th century deprived Scotland of many of those most likley to set up businesses , and Scotland is suffering the effects of that .\nNow there is Brexit sending many from the EU home as they can \u2019 t live in the hostile environment created by Pritti Patel .\nThis has robbed Scotland of more entrepreneurs , and the ongoing hostility to refugees is not likely to help .\nAn independent Scotland would have welcomed the positive contribution to our economy many of these people could have made .\nRemember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s legacy : Manufacturing \u2019 s share of national income has fallen from a quarter when Mrs Thatcher entered Downing Street in 1979 to just over a tenth today .\nIn the wake of the Chancellor \u2019 s Spring Statement , Simon Jack , BBC Business Editor , tweeted : The Chancellor \u2019 s recent Spring Statement has not been well received , seen to favour the wealthy and do little or nothing for those already struggling .\nCommentators are saying the Chancellor is inflicting the biggest drop in living standards since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo the outlook isn \u2019 t looking rosy for the UK as a whole .\nAnother reason why the UK government is desperate to hang on to energy-rich and resource rich Scotland .\nThe mythical broad shoulders of the Union are twitchy and slumped .\nThe next time a politician mentions those broad shoulders remember that for many people those mythical broad shoulders now mean poverty and an unending struggle to survive , the exception being the Tory party \u2019 s rich , often apparently Russian , friends .\nScotland can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn contrast to Sunak \u2019 s Spring Statement and his clawing back of the \u00a320 a week additional paynent to those on Universal Credit , the Scottish Government \u2019 s Scottish Child Payment will double to \u00a320 a week from April , with the payment then increasing to \u00a325 a week by the end of 2022 helping to lift 50,000 children out of poverty .\nThe Scottish Government also spends around \u00a3600 million every year mitigating some of Westminster \u2019 s policies , such as the bedroom tax , that have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn case you believe matters under Westminster will improve in the coming years you might want to think again after reading this : So , exports 15 % lower with Brexit , which Scotland did not vote for , with productivity 4 % lower after 15 years and none of the much lauded , much promoted free trade agreements having \u2018 a material impact \u2019 .\nScotland can surely do better than this , it would be difficult to do any worse .\nSome people in England believe England pays for everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free university education and everything else \u2013 apparently unaware that , like them , people in Scotland pay taxes .\nAll countries make choices about what money will be spent on and how much .\nScotland has chosen to go down a Northern European route where money is spent on a social agenda , supporting people who live here and encouraging them to fulfill their ambitions .\nUltimately this benefits individuals as well as the economy .\nA well educated , well trained , healthy and happy population reaps benefits for all .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ some people to the democratic right of people in Scotland to determine their own government and their own futures .\nJacob Rees-Mogg said a few days ago to a Westminster parliamentary committee that he won \u2019 t pretend to respect the Scottish Government \u201c because it \u2019 s led by an SNP administration that I think is not in the interests of the people of Scotland.\n\u201d So Rees-Mogg is actually saying he doesn \u2019 t believe in democracy and doesn \u2019 t respect the Scottish people .\nHe conveniently forgets , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SNP was returned to government less than a year ago with an overwhelming majority .\nThe SNP MSPs along with the Green MSPs , with whom they are now in government , make up a substantial government majority in favour of independence .\nLet \u2019 s not allow Westminster and Unionists to con us over that .\nWhen cabinet ministers can lie with such impunity then people have to ask themselves whenever he or she speaks whether anything said can be believed .\nBehind every quote that makes the headlines is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right wing Tory agenda .\nAnd for those who wondered why the UK Prime Minister often appeared not to be on top of his brief , making glaring mistakes in speeches , well it appears he relies on brief WhatsApp updates to keep him informed rather than bothering to read the papers in his red box .\nUnfortunately there is misinformation and ignorance pedalled to people in England about Scotland .\nThis is obvious on social media and call-in programmes .\nSome shrug and call the comments banter .\nOthers believe it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help explain the cringe , the inferiority compex that has haunted too many Scots for centuries .\nThis was on TalkRadio recently .\nIn England priorities differ , though as people near retirement some come to approve of Scotland \u2019 s different spending priorities and move north to avail themselves of our better staffed NHS , free prescriptions , care and bus travel as well as often lower living costs in a supportive and attractive environment .\nThe environment doesn \u2019 t just boost tourism , it is also a main factor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for highly educated , skilled workforces and places where there is an excellent quality of life to keep their employees happy .\nA competitive cost base , and supportive business environment also make global companies want to locate here .\nThe recent royal tour to the Caribbean has not gone as well as anticipated because of anti-colonialism protests and a few countries expressing the desire to become republics , with the Queen no longer head of state .\nMore people coming to the conclusion that colonialism is outdated .\nIndependence has nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbours .\nWe are all mongrels , many in Scotland have English relatives and family members who have relocated down south .\nIndependence has everything to do with wanting to take responsibility for our own lives \u2013 something Boris Johnson and members of his cabinet have been vociferous about recently in connection with the lifting of covid protections , and also with regard to Ukraine .\nIn his speech on 24th February on the war in Ukraine Johnson wound up saying : Scotland , as an old established European country , wants that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the UK to defend our right to chose whether we remain as part of the UK or opt to become once again an independent country .\nWe want to make our own decisions , build the kind of democracy we want , look after our population whether children , adults , elderly , no matter where they were born .\nWe want to be able to elect our own parliamentarians in a democratic parliamentary system where advancement is by dint of knowledge and expertise not based on the ability to buy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud is not unknown .\nScotland aims to be a caring country .\nRecently Westminster Tory MPs voted against the International Refugee Convention which Britain helped to draft in the wake of the Second World War , asking all countries to do their bit to help those fleeing the horrors of war .\nWestminster Tory MPs then voted to make it a criminal offence for Ukrainian families to arrive in UK without the right papers with a penalty of up to 4yrs in prison .\nThey also voted to grant Priti Patel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including children and the vulnerable \u2013 to remote offshore detention camps .\nMeanwhile the Scottish Parliament voted uanimously to allow Ukrainian refugees immediate access to social security benefits .\nThat surely is a sign of the compassionate , tolerant , world-focussed country Scotland can becone with independence .\nSuch a contrast to the shameful actions taking place at Westminster .\nIndependence is normal yet some can support Ukraine against Russia , berating Putin \u2019 s threat to an independent country , whilst rubbishing the claim of Scotland to independence .\nScotland was independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated previously the Union could be regarded as an aberration \u2013 \u2018 a departure from what is normal , usual , or expected , typically one that is unwelcome \u2019 .\nOur desire is to return to our previous normal state of independence with a 21st century basis and focus .\nIn a 2014 article , as relevant now as then , in Bella Caledonia by Adan Ramsay \u2013 Scotland isn \u2019 t different , it \u2019 s Britain that \u2019 s bizarre he points out that : \u201c \u2026when people say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic aspirations of Scots are an anomaly , they are missing the point entirely .\nThe social attitudes of Scots , and the policies of the Scottish Parliament , are pretty much standard for a European country .\nScotland isn \u2019 t the exception , it \u2019 s the rule.\n\u201d \u201c But for most of the Western world , the sort of Scotland that SNP talk about , that most yes campaigners say we can expect , isn \u2019 t exceptional , it \u2019 s not even better than average .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can achieve much more .\nBut the \u201c cloud cuckoo land \u201d aspiration of the Scottish Government is to be an average , run of the mill , bog-standard European country .\nCompared to where we are now , that would be a great start.\n\u201d The people in the rest of these isles will always be our neighbours , our friends , often our relatives , but they will no longer be our masters or overlords

.\nFuel self-sufficiency is far from the norm and is causing a major rethink of energy policies in many European countries which buy oil and gas from Russia .\nFood self-sufficiency , or its lack , is beginning to cause worries , major problems caused by Brexit and Covid-19 .\nWheat and sunflower oil that come largely from Ukraine and Russia could begin to impact on the availability and cost of foodstuffs made from these .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects are miniscule on GDP ( 178 trade deals would be required to counter the loss of trade with the EU and Britain \u2019 s trade deal with Australia is expected to add a mere 0.02 % to the UK economy over 15 years ) these will impact on sectors already reeling , mainly livestock farming and food production .\n\u201c The food and farming sector is a key part of the UK economy .\nIt \u2019 s the largest manufacturing sector , and contributed some \u00a3127 billion , which is 6.7 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\n\u201c During 2021 , the sector faced a number of unprecedented challenges as it adapted to the circumstances created by the covid-19 pandemic , the imposition of checks and controls on exports from Great Britain to the European Union , and challenging issues around cost and timeliness , for example in relation to energy , fertilisers , carbon dioxide availability , packaging and shipping .\nHowever , the single biggest factor affecting the sector has been labour shortages \u201c The two hignlighted quotes above are from the first paragraph in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Food and Rural Affairs Committee report on Labour shortages in the food and farming sector , Fourth Report of Session 2021\u201322 .\nThe report shows that as of August 2021 , the food and drink sector had a chronic labour shortage , with Scotland Food and Drink saying that the shortage of labour is the single biggest challenge they face .\nLabour availability is a barrier to growth with the possibility of the food supply chain breaking down .\nMuch more needs to be done to attract domestic workers and increase investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected to make up for the sudden decline in overseas labour in the short term .\nScotland \u2019 s food and drink sector is the largest manufacturing sector in Scotland , generating 18.8 per cent of Scottish manufacturing turnover .\nScottish agriculture directly employs over 63,000 people and supplies a rich larder that ranges from in-season strawberries to quality Scotch Beef , all of which is produced to high standards which Scotland has led the way in establishing .\nOwing to the quality and provenance of Scottish beef and lamb it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the value derived by the red meat industry is generated from sales outside of Scotland .\nScottish farmers are members of a number of quality farm assurance schemes , including the QMS Cattle & Sheep Assurance Scheme , Scottish Quality Cereals Farm Assurance , Red Tractor Farm Assurance , and more .\nSince many farms are small and medium sized family enterprises one quarter of regular farming staff are family members .\nCurrently the UK is only 60 per cent self-sufficient in food so any problems that reduce that percentage need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of staff has had an impact on that sector with the report quoting : \u25b6\ufe0e 10 % of cucumber growing members didn \u2019 t plant a third crop due to a lack of workers \u25b6\ufe0e over \u00a3500,000 of produce was left to rot in the fields due to a lack of staff \u25b6\ufe0e approximately 44 tonnes of fruit was wasted this year due to labour shortages \u25b6\ufe0e the National Pig Association reported approximately 10,000 vacancies with a lack of skilled butchers \u25b6\ufe0e BPC also reported that many members had cut back weekly chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened to undermine the food supply chain \u2019 s long-standing just-in-time model \u25b6\ufe0e 10 % vacancy rate within the hospitality sector since end of July 2021 lockdown ( around 200,000 workers ) \u25b6\ufe0e labour shortages and broader supply chain issues were suppressing revenues by 15 to 20 % \u25b6\ufe0e staggering shortage of between 70,000 and 100,000 HGV drivers \u25b6\ufe0e warehousing shortage rates of 10 to 20 % caused considerable delays at distribution centres \u25b6\ufe0e morale in the industry low , with workers having to work harder , longer hours \u2013 60 , 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for these problems ?\n\u201c While we recognised difficulties in disentangling the precise effects of different reasons for the labour shortages , our evidence was clear that the two main causes were : the covid-19 pandemic and Brexit.\n\u201d Historically the food production sector has been highly dependent on overseas workers , especially from the EU .\nOf the 2.3 million EU citizens working in the UK on a permanent basis in July 2021 around a fifth were thought to be in the food and drink supply chain .\nLabour shortages , caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly affected businesses across the food and farming sector and without a swift resolution they threaten to shrink the sector permanently \u201c with a chain reaction of wage rises and price increases reducing competitiveness , leading to food production being exported abroad and increased imports.\n\u201d Some sectors have offered hgher wages and other incentives to attract and retain staff .\nBut with margins in the UK \u2019 s food and drink supply chain extremely low , higher operating costs\u2014such as increased wages\u2014 would result in \u201c demand destruction for domestically produced product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has much better access to labour \u201d .\nIn response to these labour shortages the UK Government announced three temporary short-term visa schemes for selected parts of the food supply chain .\nThese were for : Poultry workers ( 1845 applicants ) , HGV drivers ( 135 applicants ) , Pork butchers ( 170 applicants ) .\nMany stakeholders described these schemes as being \u201c too little , too late \u201d , criticising the low number of visas , the timing of their introduction , the duration of the visas , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scottish Land and Estates considered the schemes for the poultry sector and HGV drivers wholly inadequate and unlikely to have a material benefit .\nThe 800 temporary short-term visas for pork butchers was said to be merely \u201c scratching the surface \u201d .\nSome producers regarded the current immigration policy as not being designed to work for food and farming , with many jobs in the sector not eligible for visas , which can work out extremely expensive , because they do not meet the skill criteria or , in some cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered an oversight , but rather a \u201c deliberate decision to have an immigration policy that was very much slanted towards high skilled [ workers ] \u201d .\nIt was considered shortages could create cost pressures that undermine UK competitiveness and lead to the \u2018 export \u2019 of some businesses in the sector .\nThe British Retail Consortium warned that \u2018 the UK had \u201c a choice \u201d to \u201c accept [ that ] a proportion of migrant workers is required to maintain production at its current level or allow an element of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries where labour is available and then import that into our supply chain \u201d .\nThis of course would result in enormous harm to food growers and producers , farmers and indeed rural areas with a likely fall in the standard of the food we eat and of animal welfare standards .\nThe report considers the Government failed to grasp the labour issues faced by the food and farming sector and found there had also been \u2018 an unwelcome tendency for the Government to blame the sector for not doing more to tackle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system\u2014sometimes on the basis of incorrect information.\n\u2019 \u201c The evidence we have taken leaves us in no doubt about the seriousness of the issues facing the food and farming sector caused by labour shortages .\nThese include food security , animal welfare and the mental health of those working in the sector .\nIn contrast , the Government has not demonstrated a strong understanding of these issues , and even on occasion sought to pass the blame onto the sector on the basis of incorrect information about its own immigration system .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and work together with the sector to devise solutions that speedily help address the problems it faces , in the short , medium and long-term to help the UK \u2019 s food industry and enable it to thrive .\nFailure to do so risks shrinking the sector and leading to higher food inflation at the price of the UK \u2019 s competitiveness , thereby making the country more reliant on food imports as we export our food production capacity\u2014as well as the jobs it supports\u2014abroad.\n\u201d Unlike most of the mainstream media , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kleptocrats we run on a shoestring and it is a bit frayed .\nWe

Peter Rowberry with additional reporting by Newsroom It seems that the policy to build new nuclear power stations has caused some friction at the heart of the cabinet , with the Prime Minister trying to get the agreement of the Chancellor to spend at least \u00a3100 billion on eight new nuclear power stations .\nThis didn \u2019 t stop the government issuing its energy security strategy last week .\nSuch a huge commitment merits careful scrutiny .\nHinkley Point C was one of eight announced by the British government in 2010 with a nuclear site licence granted in November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project in July 2016 and on 15 September 2016 the UK government approved the project in principle .\nConstruction work on-site began by late September 2016 .\nCompletion of the reactor bases was completed in June 2019 for reactor 1 and June 2020 for reactor 2 .\nThe two bases required a total of 633,700 cubic feet of concrete .\nHinkley C is the only one of the 2010 eight designated sites to have commenced construction .\nThe UK government strategy paper calls for 8 further new nuclear plants but does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brown government \u2019 s announcement in 2008 which the coalition government pinned down in 2010 .\nWith only 1 of 8 since 2010 actually under construction the conclusion is the new 8 suggested could be decades from coming online .\nEarlier costs for Hinkley C were estimated at around \u00a318 billion .\nThe current cost estimate is around \u00a322 to \u00a323 billion , and the first reactor will not be complete until June 2026 at the earliest , and the second at least six months later .\nThis timetable is currently being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar nuclear reactors in China meaning the design may need to be changed .\nEDF have not commented on whether this will affect the timescale for completing the project .\nThese delays , and the consequent impact on other nuclear projects , such as Sizewell C and Wylfa , have resulted in serious failures to meet the government obligations to move to low carbon generation and taken up time , time which we are now desperately short of if we are to meet our target of reducing carbon emissions by 50 % by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe building of the two reactors that form the Sizewell C project is still not fully financed .\nNor has the planning process been completed .\nAll the work in progress so far is on vast quantities of paper and construction can not commence until Sizewell C plant receives planning permission .\nThere remains considerable opposition to Sizewell C over the high cost of nuclear energy and environmental issues .\nThe cost of a plant that is over 10 years away from generating power will start hitting electricity bills sometime soon .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and financing costs to be added to customer bills , as Sizewell C is built over the next decade , is due for a second reading in the House of Commons next month.\n\u201d \u201c Legislation allowing construction and financing costs to be added to customer bills , as Sizewell C is built over the next decade , is due for a second reading in the House of Commons next month.\n\u201d BBC News Business 27th March 2022 The UK government and EDF have pledged 20 % of the cost each , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found .\nSome of that is a levy on our electricity bills for a decade before Sizewell generates a single Kwh .\nThe government \u2019 s plans to have eight nuclear reactors up and running by 2030 seem naively optimistic .\nNew nuclear is not a quick fix , as our near neighbours will attest .\nThe Finnish reactor , Olkiluoto 3 , was started in 2005 , but only went onto the grid seventeen years later , on 15 March this year .\nOf the eight nuclear power plants announced back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be generating by 2026 ( 16 years ) and Sizewell C by 2032 , subject to planning permission ( 22 years ) None of the other 6 proposed nuclear plants are anywhere near getting off the ground .\nFrance , a country which historically generates a large percentage of its electricity from nuclear , is in the process of building only one new reactor , a third at the Flamanville site .\nEDF , the state-owned energy giant , began work in December 2007 and the cost was estimated to be \u20ac3.3 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than \u20ac12.7 billion and it is yet to generate a single kilowatt of power .\nIn contrast , according to the European Wind Energy Association , once planning permission is given , construction of a small-scale wind farm , 10MW or less , could take less than two months .\nA larger 50MW facility may take six months , although considerably smaller in scale , this is substantially quicker than any new nuclear .\nThis has not stopped president Macron from announcing that his government will support the building of between six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elephant in the room is that the costs of new nuclear are highly \u201c back loaded \u201d , i.e.\n, that by building them you commit to high levels of expenditure at the end of their working life , to remove the fuel rods , decommission , remove and store nuclear waste .\nThe UK Nuclear Decommissioning Authority currently spend around \u00a33 billion a year for Site Licence Companies to make the current decommissioned reactors safe .\nThe Nuclear Provision is the best estimate of how much it will cost to clean up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear sites over a programme lasting over 120 years .\nThe life and slow death of a nuclear plant A nuclear plant will operate for around 45 years followed by a lengthy decommissioning period .\nThis tends to take around 20 \u2013 30 years with the cleared site monitored for at least 50 years .\nAs noted ( below ) above surface Intermediate Level Waste is left stored on site for 120 years .\nFrom the time a nuclear plant shuts down , a period of 150 years follows , around 3 times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotland .\nThe condition , treatment and disposal of the ILW will then need to be decided by a Scottish Government around 2142 in the case of Hunterston A which closed in 1990 .\nThis will continue to be a responsibility of future Scottish governments in respect of the other nuclear plants left behind from the nuclear age until well into the third quarter of the 22nd century .\nThe High Level Waste sent to Sellafield has a minimum radioactivity lethal time frame of 100,000 years .\nAs it is Easter we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noting this is 50 times longer than the period from the crucifixion to Good Friday last week .\nThere are three main categories of nuclear waste .\nLow Level Waste ( LLW ) stored in shipping containers at Sellafield , Intermediate Level Waste ( ILW ) stored in containers on the site of the former nuclear plant with a radioactive life of 120 years under Scottish policy and High Level Waste ( HLW ) sent to Sellafield pending an permanent solution .\nNewsnet covered this in relation to Chapelcross nuclear plant in Dumfries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a timeline .\nThe Financial Times produced a detailed article on nuclear energy in the UK and France noting that Sellafield has the largest stock of untreated nuclear waste in the world which includes 140 tonnes of plutonium .\nThe article also raised the unanswered question of what to do with \u201c thousands of metric tonnes of high-level nuclear waste , some of which can remain radioactive , and thereby lethal , for up to 300,000 years.\n\u201d The energy strategy remains silent about this issue .\nPrevious Westminster governments have said their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposal facility .\nUK guidance on the disposal of nuclear waste was published in March 2013 , and it is understood that local authorities were asked to nominate their areas for the site , but none volunteered .\nIn Scotland the strategy is to keep Intermediate Level Waste waste in specially constructed units on the surface near to where it was created to minimise the risks of accidents when moving it .\nFollowing the shutdown of Hunterston B , Scotland only has one working nuclear reactor at Torness .\nThat is due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be shortened if cracks in the graphite core found at Hunterston B are also found at Torness .\nEDF told Newsnet at the time Hunterston B \u2019 s last reactor shut down on 6th January this year : \u201c We carry out inspections of the graphite cores every time we take the units offline for maintenance .\nTo date , we have not observed any keyway root cracking though we know all AGR stations , includng Torness , will develop it as they approach the later part of their operating life .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly.\n\u201d All of this will be less significant if nuclear could deliver low carbon electricity at an affordable price .\nThe biggest issue on the cost of nuclear energy is the so called \u201c strike price \u201d , the price which the government has agreed to pay the owners , EDF , for electricity from their nuclear stations .\nOriginally EDF said that electricity from nuclear could be produced at around \u00a324 per megawatt hour .\nThe strike price is now set at \u00a392 .\nIt has also been agreed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation , which as we know has reached a thirty-year high and is likely to continue to be high for the foreseeable future .\nAlthough the cost of the raw materials for building wind turbines has increased , copper and steel in particular , the cost of generation by renewables has steadily decreased over time .\nThe latest strike price for offshore wind is around \u00a340 per megawatt hour and less for onshore wind .\nThere have been several missed opportunities and poor decisions by both the Labour and Conservative parties and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have put us in a position where we need urgent action .\nIn February 2004 the Labour party undertook a \u00a340 billion project to update schools , but , despite intense lobbying , energy efficiency did not form part an integral part of that plan .\nThe Conservative party made changes to the planning system to make it virtually impossible to get permission to build onshore wind farms , although that policy has now been reversed .\nThey also brought an end to the \u201c feed in tariff ( FITs ) \u201d for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 % to 20 % on solar installations \u2013 now VAT is zero as part of Sunak \u2019 s Spring statement .\nAlthough FITs were replaced by the Smart Export Guarantee , this was significantly less financially attractive and has reduced the incentive to install Solar photovoltaic cells .\nIt has now become urgent to move from our dependence on fossil fuels to renewable sources .\nThere are 27 million households in the UK .\nIt seems the government is prepared to pay around \u00a3370 per household to support nuclear power .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around \u00a31250 for a four-bedroom house but is likely to save around \u00a3250 per year in heating costs .\nInsulation is now mandated for all new house building but does not cover the existing estate .\nHouses are expected to be occupied on average for more than 70 years , so replacement of inefficient homes with newer housing stock will be slow , far too slow to meet our climate change targets .\nIn September 2021 , the UK government announced \u00a3265 million to subsidise renewable energy , \u00a3200 million for offshore wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including tidal .\nThe remaining \u00a310 million will be used for onshore wind and solar .\nThe budget for building the HS2 railway project is around \u00a395 billion .\nThe budget for purchasing an updated Trident missile system will be at least \u00a3100 billion , and depending on who you believe , may be up to \u00a3205 billion .\nShould not some of this money be diverted to secure our renewable low carbon energy future more rapidly ?\nUnlike most of the mainstream media , funded by foreign billionaires , right-wing plutocrats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a bit frayed .\nWe know things are tough for everyone not in the top 10 % but small donations help

UK inflation the highest of G7 countries?", "content": "The headline graphic presents a picture of inflation in G7 countries at very different levels and in this article we will try and unpick some of the reasons behind why different countries appear to be fairing better than others .\nWe are all acutely aware of the huge increases in energy , fuel and food prices squeezing our so called \u2018 disposable \u2019 income and the chart clearly shows UK inflation is the highest in the G7 with some predicting it could rise to 10 % before the end of the year .\nThe lower your income the higher the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher your income the more absorbable are these increases .\nThe Bank of England expects inflation to increase to 10 % later this year , to stabilise next year and fall towards their 2 % target within 2 years .\nThat does not mean energy prices will have fallen back towards pre-Ukraine invasion levels .\nIt simply means the upward price pressure may have stabilised and worked out of annual inflation levels .\nThe high UK 9 % rate is significant compared to the three EU countries .\nGermany is a major manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany is facing significant challenges in replacing Russian oil and gas but is making steady progress .\nGermany cut fuel tax by up to 30 cents which equals 26p or five times the the 5p cut Sunak made .\nThe UK , US and Germany have all their major electricity energy providers in the private sector .\nFrance and Italy have significant levels of state ownership .\nEDF is 85 % owned by the French government which enabled Macron to restrict the increase EDF could charge for electricity to 4 % .\nAlthough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power stations produce 72 % of France \u2019 s electricity .\nThe highest share of nuclear energy in the world .\nNuclear energy is expensive so how was this possible ?\nThe costs of new nuclear just keep rising but the old power stations nearing end of life have returned their capital costs .\nSqueezing a few more years out of them is cost effective if the costs of maintenance are less than the value of the power generated .\nFrance , like the UK , only has 1 new nuclear power station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated before the election he intended to take the remaining 15 % of EDF into state control .\nMacron realised he had to do something to keep electricity costs down .\nEDF simply was not given the option of making the huge profits generators in the private sector in other countries were able to .\nWhenever EDF needs more money for investment the French state is always there to provide , as was the case in a recent rights issue to bolster their working capital .\nIt was very much an opportunity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such opportunity for the UK because Westminster has long sold off everything the state owned .\nWill Sunak finally tax the high profits of energy companies raking in exceptional profits ?\nItaly introduced a 10 % tax in March and in early May increased this to 25 % to pay for help with the energy bills of both consumers and businesses .\nItaly \u2019 s latest 14 billion euro support package comes on top of a previous \u20ac10 billion .\nLow income families and pensioners get a \u20ac200 cash payment to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this having to be repaid like in the UK which is just a future tax rise on individuals .\nFood costs are rising everywhere due to global supply trends .\nThe UK left the EU and all the red tape and restrictions as a result have yet to come fully into force .\nWith free movement the EU can share and buy across borders , Not so in the UK where delays in imports from the EU take longer and cost more .\nUK exports that moved freely once upon a time are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of red tape causing delays and making many , especially smaller companies , simply ending trying export to the EU .\nJapan has always been an outlier with persistently low inflation despite very high levels of borrowing .\nJapan is the most indebted country in the world at 266 % of GDP .\n45 % of this debt is held by the Bank of Japan .\nUnlike the UK Scotland is a net energy exporter .\nWe need the powers of independence to fully manage our energy industries in the interests of climate @ @ @

regular contact with EU governments and the US there is an understanding of the political situation in Scotland that did not exist in 2014 .\nAnyone who has not yet watched the Brookings video should

over the first paper on Building a New Scotland launched this week and selects some pertinent parts from this first major resource shaping the coming independence referendum Whilst the UK government was busy making itself a pariah , fuelling wrath over its treatment of asylum seekers and of its determination to make sweeping changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol , the Scottish Government was laying out evidence to support the forthcoming debate on independence , with a referendum scheduled for 2023 , probably the autumn .\nThe document Independence in the Modern World : Wealthier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotland ?\nis \u201c the first in a series of Building a New Scotland papers designed to contribute to a full , frank and constructive debate on Scotland \u2019 s future.\n\u201d There is an acknowledgement that : \u201c Scotland has already come a long way since 2014 .\nA great deal of nation building has been done in the years since the last referendum .\nFor example , in Revenue Scotland , we now have our own tax agency , and in Social Security Scotland , our own social security agency .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission and the Scottish National Investment Bank .\nIn other words , substantial parts of the institutional infrastructure that an independent country would need , and which did not exist in 2014 , are now in place.\n\u201d So we start this independence campaign from a higher starting point than we did for the 2014 referendum .\nThe series of papers to be published in the months ahead will set out details on key issues that people will want information on .\nThis first paper is a scene setter as any case for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the \u2018 status quo \u2019 before we can discuss options for the way forward .\nThis paper asks whether Scotland \u2019 s position in the UK has enabled us to reach our full potential , now and in the future , especially now that the UK is outside the EU .\nA number of countries have been selected for comparison across a range of economic and social indicators , with the performance of the UK ( and therefore Scotland as part of the UK ) .\nThese are Denmark , Sweden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland , Switzerland , Austria Belgium and the Netherlands .\nThis comparison overwhelmingly suggests that independent countries of Scotland \u2019 s size do significantly better , outperforming the UK .\nThe comparison suggests the status quo as part of the UK is not working for Scotland or in its best interests and poses the question on how best to fix our underperformance .\n\u201c What this \u2013 and the papers that follow \u2013 will seek to do is to demonstrate that becoming an independent country , while forging a close and constructive partnership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our fellow Europeans , can and will help Scotland match the performance of our neighbours and fulfil our potential.\n\u201d The comparisons in this paper suggest that across a range of key economic and social measures , \u201c the UK is out-performed by a comparator group of European countries .\nThis strongly suggests that Scotland \u2019 s performance suffers from being tied to an increasingly outmoded economic and social model and would benefit from applying lessons from the different models discussed in this paper .\nThe full powers of independence would extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The paper states an \u201c assessment and arguments presented by Professor Kevin O \u2019 Rourke discussing Ireland \u2019 s economic development as an independent country is of interest .\nProfessor O \u2019 Rourke argues that \u201c a plausible candidate \u201d for Ireland \u2019 s economic underperformance in the period between 1954 and 1973 ( when Ireland joined the then EEC ) was \u201c excessive reliance on the sluggish British economy \u201d .\nIreland \u2019 s improved economic performance after 1973 , even before the creation of the Single Market , coincided with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade .\n\u201c EEC membership led to a far more diversified Irish economy , less dependent on its immediate neighbour , and healthier as a result.\n\u201d The key UK government policy of levelling up has had little effect on regional equality .\nThe report states : \u201c Professor Philip McCann a leading authority on regional economics , recently examined the issue of whether the UK displays high levels of interregional inequality in the context of 28 different indicators and 30 different OECD countries , concluding that \u201c The result is clear .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ interregionally unbalanced countries in the industrialised world\u2026and almost certainly the most interregionally unequal large high-income country \u201d .\nScotland can do better Independence is not a stand-alone issue .\nIt is not divorced from performances in health , education , the economy .\nIndependence is not an abstract issue \u2013 it is about strengthening Scotland \u2019 s economic and social performance so improving Scotland \u2019 s fiscal position .\nIndependence is about Scotland having the powers , the finances and the abilities to enhance prosperity , earnings , opportunities and the wellbeing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations to come .\nThe paper is essential reading .\nMany of the graphs and bar charts tell a stark story .\nHere are few of the graphs from the paper which will be an ongoing source of information to draw on in the months ahead .\nThe paper questions why most of the comparator countries are able to sustain relatively high spending over the long-term ?\nEvidence suggests that higher confidence in government is correlated with higher levels of willingness to comply with taxes and , with the exception of Belgium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this respect .\n\u201c Trust in government \u2013 percentage share of the population responding \u201c yes \u201d to the question \u201c In this country do you have trust in national government ?\n\u201d \u2013 Switzerland 84.6 % , Norway 82.9 % , Finland 80.9 % , Netherlands 78.1 % , Denmark 71.6 % , Sweden 67.1 % , Austria 62.6 % , Iceland 59.2 % , Ireland 58.8 % , UK 34.7 % and Belgium 29.5 % .\nHowever \u201c Since 1999 , the Scottish Social Attitudes survey has found that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more , adults in Scotland have been significantly more likely to say that they trust the Scottish Government to act in Scotland \u2019 s best interests \u2018 most of the time \u2019 or \u2018 just about always \u2019 , than to say that they trust the UK Government to do so.\n\u201d On the UK business model the report observes that \u201c the UK has long pursued a different economic path to that of most countries in northern and western Europe , and the policy choices it has made have resulted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d .\nIt cites the UK \u2019 s short-term approach to ownership and corporate governance , making it much more open to foreign buyouts , low prevalence of public ownership and a particularly active market for corporate control .\nIndependence will not magically bring changes overnight , it will not even bring about major changes in a short time frame .\nLike all major changes time will be required .\nBut independence will allow us to determine the type of country we want to live in and to have our say on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit from those changes , with Scotland becoming a wealthier , happier and fairer country , playing our part internationally for the good of

in the gloom has been the announcement of another referendum on independence in 2023 , possibly in October .\nThat of course has sent unionists into overdrive , frenetically insisting that the

.\nThe European Convention on Human Rights is , as was , as mentioned in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe \u2019 s convention and the cornerstone of all its activities .\nIt is an international convention to protect human rights and political freedoms in Europe .\nDrafted in 1950 by the then newly formed Council , the convention entered into force on 3 September 1953.\n\u201d The Council of Europe is an

government was insisting on ?\nOr perhaps all three reasons .\nJohnson and his henchmen are adamant they want to distance themselves from anything European and retract further into the old policy of splendid isolation .\nSplendid isolation is not a new concept to Britain .\nThe term was used to describe the 19th-century British diplomatic practice of avoiding permanent alliances , particularly under the Conservative governments of Lord Salisbury between 1885 and 1902 .\nAccording to Wikipedia , the term was coined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s minimal involvement in European affairs .\nPlus

numerous times in history and has never turned out well .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westminster that believes it can do better by producing its own bill than by continuing its incorporation of the convention into UK law through the Hunan Rights Act 1998 .\nThe UK government knows better than the other 45 signatories to the Convention .\nViews of humans about their rights Amongst those not in the legal

will be legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same approach as Hitler \u2019 s 1933 Enabling Act .\nIt has also been described as a serious attack on our rights , one that enables this and future governments to do as they like .\nThat we are headed to authoritarian government and a dictatorship was mentioned by many .\nBut what is the view of the experts \u2013 the lawyers ?\nIt is the job of lawyers to interpret

a press release issued on the 22nd June it stated : Rather surprisingly one of their number , Dominic Raab , lawyer and Justice Secretary , who was responsible for the bill , doesn \u2019 t appear to agree .\nThis is what he said on BBC \u2019 s Newsnight .\nThe Law Society of Scotland also issued a statement .\nAdam Wagner , a barrister who specialises in public law , human rights and general civil law , tweeted : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bill of Rights but the worst by far is that it is so messy .\nThe Human Rights Act is a careful and elegant piece of legislation .\nThe \u201c bill of rights

chosen to repeal and replace the HRA .\nWhile the Government intends the UK to remain a State Party to the ECHR , the Bill \u201c hardly implies a full-throated commitment by the Government to the ECHR \u201d with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aims \u2014 of the Bill being to introduce greater distance than presently exists between the UK \u2019 s human rights regime and the ECHR system .\nProfessor Elliott states that contrary to the assertion of the Justice Secretary , the Bill does not enhance human rights protection and does not maintain the same level of protection as the HRA , diminishing the level and forms of domestic protection afforded to the convention rights .\nProfessor Elliott \u2019 s concluding paragraph does not pull its punches .\nThe Tories will push this legislation

reiterated what was in the recently published paper Independence in the Modern World : Wealthier , Happier , Fairer : Why Not Scotland ?\nThis clearly showed Scotland ( like most of England ) @ @ @ @

"Section 30s and much more", "content": "The following explanation on Section 30s , widely used with devolved nations , is only part of the story of the day and not necessarily how a democratic vote on Scottish independence will be held .\nThe following text is from a Tweet thread by Lindsay Bruce this morning .\nAhead of Nicola Sturgeon \u2019 s statement today , it may be useful to go over what a \u201c Section 30 \u201d actually is , because the media usually get it completely wrong .\nSection 30 refers to part of the Scotland Act ( the act that defines devolution ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Section 30 is specifically in place to enable the temporary transfer of powers to the Scottish Parliament that are usually outwith it \u2019 s competence ( or \u201c ultra vires \u201d in legal parlance meaning \u201c beyond the powers \u201d ) , or to temporarily remove powers already in its competence .\nSection 30 is not specific to holding referendums , it \u2019 s merely a legal mechanism to transfer powers to the parliament that it wouldn \u2019 t otherwise hold .\nPrevious Section 30 \u2019 s included power to legislate for railways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , and Brexit business .\nThe actual Section 30 text can be found here : https : //legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/ You \u2019 ll notice that it refers a lot to \u201c Order in Council \u201d .\nWhat is this ?\nBasically an Order in Council is a command issued by the monarch on the advice of the Privy Council .\nIn the UK , the Queen is simply a figurehead , and the order is drafted and controlled by the UK government .\nAn Order in Council can be issued by passing an Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and become law , or by using the \u201c Royal Prerogative \u201d \u2013 and edict issued by the government of the day that does not have to be approved by parliament .\nA Section 30 can be raised by the UK government or any of the devolved administrations \u2013 but they can only be approved by the UK Government , and must be passed by the House of Commons , the Lords , and the devolved parliament concerned ( in our case the Scottish Parliament ) .\nRight , that \u2019 s the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here \u2019 s where is gets interesting .\nIn 2013 , the Scottish Parliament did not have the power to hold referendums or even it \u2019 s own elections .\nPrevious using the powers of the UK Parliament .\nThis changed with the Scotland Act ( 2016 ) .\nWith the powers to hold elections and referenda devolved , after extensive consultation the Scottish Parliament passed two Acts which empower it to hold votes when it needs to WITHOUT primary legislation .\nThat is , it no longer needs to pass an Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this begs an interesting question : Since the Scottish Parliament now has it \u2019 s own power to hold votes as required , does it need a Section 30 from Westminster to hold # indyref2 ?\nThe answer is ; nobody ( currently ) knows , because it hasn \u2019 t been tested in court .\nBear with me while we take a quick detour to explain : Just because the UK Gov has passed something , it doesn \u2019 t make it \u201c legal \u201d , \u201c illegal \u201d or \u201c unlawful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tested in court .\nTo actually find out if something is inside or outside of the law , a case has to be taken to court and decided by a judge , or a panel of judges .\nLawyers for both sides of a case will make legal arguments citing previous legislation and case law in order to back their claims .\nIt is up to the judge ( or judges ) as \u201c fact finders \u201d to determine , based on their understanding of pertinent law , whether a claimant is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This gives considerable scope for lawyers to argue over the meaning of every word pertaining to a case .\nSo until this happens , anybody who describes # indyref2 as \u201c illegal \u201d or \u201c unlawful \u201d is just lying through their teeth , because that hasn \u2019 t been decided yet .\nNow , back to the # indyref2 bill .\nUnder the Scotland Act , the union and the constitution are \u201c reserved \u201d matters , meaning that only the UK parliament can legislate on them .\nBut would holding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just having a vote doesn \u2019 t bind anybody to action .\nIn the UK \u2013 and indeed all modern democracies \u2013 ALL votes , whether they are for general elections , council elections or referendums on the EU or Scottish independence are non-binding .\nThey carry no weight save for representing the opinion of the public .\nSo legally speaking , just having a vote doesn \u2019 t bind the UK parliament to do anything .\nEven if 90 % of the population vote for something , the parliament doesn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be incredibly unwise to ignore a poll .\nDemocracies function on consent of the people .\nIf you start abusing that consent by , for example , ignoring the result of a perfectly legal vote , then you get into a bad situation on whether the government is acting in the interests of the people .\nRevolutions happen down that road .\nSo finally , we come to the \u201c Catalonian Question \u201d \u2013 can UK Gov simply brand # indyref2 \u201c unlawful \u201d , ignore the result and try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On point 3 , definitely not .\nSpain \u2019 s constitution defines it as one unbreakable state .\nNot the case in the UK .\nWhile unionist politicians have and will no doubt continue to call # indyref2 \u201c unlawful \u201d they can \u2019 t actually credibly do so until a court has decided that .\nBut the unionists might not want to go that route because there \u2019 s a danger the judgement goes against them .\nSo to sum up , what we have here is a battle of political wills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut even a UK court ruling won \u2019 t end it .\nThere \u2019 s still the European Court of Human Rights , which technically the UK is still bound by .\nThe article was amended at 7.00pm to remove the repetition of two paragraphs", "author": "NEWSROOM", "url":

are paying our energy suppliers in these hidden taxes , but there is more .\nSome of the energy companies that went bust had not paid into the renewable energy fund as required and that adds just short of \u00a3300 million , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills .\nThe estimated cost per household could be around \u00a320 to \u00a325 .\nSo the total now is around \u00a3280 .\nBut there is more coming When Bulb went down it was too big to for any other energy companies to swallow and the government nationalised it .\nWith no experience of running an energy company the government decided Bulb would not be allowed to buy contracts in advance to supply households but would have to cover supply using expensive spot prices .\nThe government are desperate to get rid of Bulb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million on Bulb and allocated a further \u00a31billion for running costs .\nJust who might turn up to take Bulb off the government \u2019 s hands is not an easy guess .\nThey would need to have energy experience and be backed by considerable resources but more than that they would want a very generous payout to take on Bulb .\nThe final cost of Bulb is intended to be added to all our household energy bills as another so called levy or hidden tax .\nCitizens Advice said the government had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choice not to buy energy in advance \u2014 meaning taxpayers will have to cover the cost of buying energy at a premium .\nAnother \u00a3200+ added would be a conservative estimate , bringing the hidden energy taxes to around \u00a3500 a year .\nBut there are more \u2018 levies \u2019 in the pipeline With the installation of smart meters it is possible to calculate consumption by connected households every half hour .\nIt is proposed that consumers shifting the electricity they use away from peak time would get lower prices , basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off-peak tariffs for storage heaters .\nThe second part of this thinking , if thinking is the right term , it that the discount some enjoy will be paid for by another \u2018 levy \u2019 added to our bills .\nThe idea of encouraging households to switch more of their usage is a sound idea .\nAdding the payback to those able to change energy use back onto our energy bills it a very stupid idea .\nWith off-peak storage heating consumers got cheaper electricity because it suited power companies to help spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add the cost to those on other forms of heating .\nA major benefit to energy companies is it will help reduce the high cost of the more expensive generation forms like gas and nuclear at peak times as well as helping England stave off some of the coal generation now planned for this winter .\nLast winter West Midlands was burning coal for 20 % of generation and England has arranged for an additional coal plant to be available this winter .\nThe last thing households need is all these extra \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicted for later this year .\nNewsnet agrees with the Citizen \u2019 s Advice Bureau that these costs should be met by the Treasury .\nYes it will end up in general taxation but that makes for being honest about tax rather that hiding these levies , taxes by another name , on household energy bills .\nShould the proposal to reduce pricing for increased off-peak usage progress then this will probably start with a couple of pilots chosen from the UK \u2019 s 14 power regions managed by their Distribution Network Operators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the government are proposing it would be easier and helpful in contributing to meeting climate change targets to introduce a scheme that is dedicated to power generation .\nIt is very much in the interests of Distribution Network Operators ( DNOs ) to engage as it will help their load management and also save costs on more expensive generation activated to meet peak time demand .\nIt would make sense for the Treasury to provide some funding to get this off the ground but it is also reasonable that the DNO \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are up and running .\nThey after all would then have a powerful story to attract consumers and businesses to their product offering .\nThe Tories are talking about tax cuts so here are two suggestions They help households by recognising all the energy levies covered in this article are in fact taxes and in a spirit of openness and honesty in a break from the Johnson period they transfer the lot to the Treasury .\nEnergy bills and rises predicted in a matter of weeks are what concerns the public most .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are simply terrified of what is in store .\nTransferring these costs to honest taxation will benefit a large percentage of the population and especially the most vulnerable already in poverty and struggling to heat or eat .\nA \u00a3500 tax cut on energy bills would be a popular decision but will it happen as the wealthy would have to start covering the cost through other taxes ?\nThat might not go down well with the tax cutting PM candidates .\nThere is also scope for cutting the 5 % tax rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected gets ever bigger with higher energy costs .\nA \u00a3500 bill attracts \u00a3100 in VAT and a \u00a32000 bill attracts \u00a3400 of VAT .\nThat should appeal to the hard Brexiteer PM candidates and Brexit Starmer .\nAn actual Brexit dividend .\nThat would be a first .\nThe VAT on energy , including heating oil , is one of the few areas where rising revenues offer scope for a tax cut .\nConcentrating help on energy bills makes the most sense rather than pretending there is vast scope for widespread tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have proposed .\nNewsnet needs your help Unlike most of the mainstream media , funded by foreign billionaires , right-wing plutocrats and kleptocrats we run on a shoestring and it is a bit frayed .\nWe

indyref2 and why today is very different to 2014 The UK Supreme Court announced on Thursday that it will hear the Lord Advocate \u2019 s referral of the Scottish Government \u2019 s # indyref2 bill to determine if it is within the Scottish Parliament \u2019 s competence to pass into law without a Section 30 transfer of powers from the UK Government .\nEarlier this week Lord Reed , the Supreme Court President , rejected the UK Government \u2019 s attempt to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without further consideration .\nThe Court has now set provisional dates of the 11th and 12th October this year to hear the case .\nUp until now , the media and opposition politicians have repeatedly referred to an independence referendum without a Section 30 as a \u201c wildcat \u201d or \u201c illegal \u201d referendum \u2013 without that ever actually being determined .\nAbsent an actual court ruling , that is a supposition and a substantial jump to a far from certain conclusion .\nSo what is the legality of a referendum to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Section 30 , as it stands today ?\nIt \u2019 s an interesting legal and political question worth digging deep on \u2013 so strap in as we time warp back to 2012 and visit Alex Salmond \u2019 s mandate for the first Scottish independence referendum .\nThe SNP won a surprise parliamentary majority in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election , leading to immediate speculation about the date of Salmond \u2019 s promised independence referendum .\nBut there were a couple of hurdles to clear first .\nBack in 2011 , the Scottish Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a referendum vote .\nIt didn \u2019 t even have the power to call for an election .\nAlthough it could legislate for local elections , it didn \u2019 t even have the power to legislate for an election to the Scottish Parliament itself .\nInstead elections to the Scottish Parliament were held under the authority of UK law .\nThis was covered in the Scotland Act 1998 Schedule 5 Reserved Powers list ( as originally enacted ) in Section B3 : Powers for elections to the Scottish Parliament were reserved to Westminster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislating for a national referendum on anything .\nThis was addressed in the 2012 Edinburgh Agreement , a landmark accord between the Scottish and UK governments that agreed a legal framework for the independence referendum and its conduct .\nThe powers required to pass the voting legislation in Holyrood would be temporarily devolved to the Scottish Parliament using the Scotland Act \u2019 s Section 30 powers .\nSpecifically , it was agreed to model the new Scottish legislation on Part 7 of the UK \u2019 s Political Parties , Elections and Referendums Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s the relevant section of the Edinburgh Agreement : And here is the relevant text of the actual Section 30 used in 2014 to modify the Scotland Act as then enacted ; So what exactly does this mean ?\nIn 2011 , the SNP had a clear mandate for holding an independence referendum , but the Scottish Parliament did not have the powers to legislate for one .\nWithout the transfer of powers from the UK government , any Referendum Act \u2013 on any issue , constitutional or otherwise \u2013 put before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultra vires by the Presiding Officer , and even if it had somehow passed the Scottish Parliament , local authorities were under no legal obligation to conduct a poll .\nSuch a vote would have been deemed unlawful .\nThe Scottish Parliament simply did not have the power to instruct local authorities to initiate a ballot .\nWithout the Edinburgh Agreement , there was no power to hold a vote .\nNow let \u2019 s briefly return to the 2014 Section 30 Order and look at Articles 1-3 : Articles 1 and 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sake of completeness .\nArticle 3 makes a specific exclusion of an independence referendum from the Scotland Act \u2019 s reserved powers if certain conditions are met , and those are listed under 5A , clauses 2 , 3 , and 4 .\nTo summarise , this Section 30 Order allowed for a binary-choice referendum on Scottish independence as long as it was held on any day before 31st December 2014 that wasn \u2019 t already being used for another referendum or general election .\nSo what \u201c reserved powers \u201d did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a look at Schedule 5 of the Scotland Act as it existed in 2013 at the time of this Section 30 Order .\nDevolution in the UK uses the \u201c reserved powers \u201d model , which means that anything not explicitly reserved to Westminster is automatically devolved ( this is how the Scottish Government was able to pass landmark Climate Change legislation , because at the time of the Scotland Act the UK Government didn \u2019 t think to reserve it ) .\nConsequently , Schedule 5 of the Scotland Act is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers that Westminster wants to keep to itself \u2013 but since the Section 30 issued in 2013 only refers to Paragraph 1 of Schedule 5 , we need only concern ourselves with that : Paragraph 1 of Schedule 5 does the heavy lifting , reserving issues related to the Crown , the Union , the Parliament , and the continued existence of the two supreme courts in Scotland ; the High Court of Justiciary ( criminal ) , and the Court of Session ( civil ) .\nThe subsequent paragraphs go on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 but it \u2019 s Paragraph 1 we \u2019 re interested in here because it \u2019 s this one which the 2013 Section 30 modified .\nIn fact if you follow the source link provided , it will take you to the complete Schedule 5 of the Scotland Act as it was 1st April 2013 including Paragraph 5A which the above Section 30 Order inserted .\nThe 2013 Section 30 Order refers to the reserved powers in the whole of paragraph 1 , but really what we \u2019 re talking about is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union of the Kingdoms of Scotland and England \u201d , and the third ; \u201c ( c ) the Parliament of the United Kingdom \u201d .\nThis part of the Scotland Act prohibits the Scottish Parliament from passing legislation which in any way modifies the Union or Parliament .\nThis is the argument which is going to the UK \u2019 s Supreme Court ; does holding an independence referendum compel modification of the Union or Parliament ?\nIt can be strongly argued that in 2014 it did because the Edinburgh Agreement bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But is the same true in 2022 when the # indyref2 bill now being put before the court is for a consultative referendum opposed by the UK Government ?\nThis is where the lawyers earn the big bucks , and this is ultimately the legal point which the UK Supreme Court needs to determine .\nWhy are we talking about voting powers transferred in 2013 ?\nBecause the situation today is completely different .\n\u201c Oh .\nI wish we hadn \u2019 t done that.\n\u201d On the 19th September 2014 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Prime Minster David Cameron stood outside Downing Street and announced that Lord Kelvin would chair the Smith Commission to make recommendations for delivering on a key promise of the Better Together campaign , namely more powers for the devolved Scottish Parliament .\nThe Smith Commission included representatives from all main political parties including the SNP , and its final report was agreed by all parties including \u2013 crucially \u2013 the Conservative and Unionist Party , who ultimately were responsible for delivering said new powers .\nThe full Smith Commission Report has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can read it here .\nBefore we get to the recommendations concerning elections in Scotland , it \u2019 s worth highlighting this nugget from the report which all political parties agreed to : This supersedes any campaign slogans such as \u201c once in a generation \u201d , or anything in the 2013 White Paper \u201c Scotland \u2019 s Future \u201d since that prospectus was ultimately rejected by voters in the 2014 referendum .\nWe can only hold the No campaign \u2019 s winning arguments to account since the case for Yes lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s get to what the Smith Commission Report said \u2013 and all parties agreed to \u2013 about future elections to the Scottish Parliament : So that \u2019 s what was promised from the Smith Commission .\nWhat was actually delivered in relation to elections in the Scotland Act ( 2016 ) ?\nFirst , let us remember that under the \u201c reserved powers \u201d model , anything not reserved is automatically devolved .\nSection B3 of Schedule 5 of the Scotland Act deals with reserved powers over elections .\nSo let \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in 2013 to remind ourselves of the position before the first independence referendum ( this is the same graphic as at the top of this article ) : That was the position in 2013 .\nNow let \u2019 s look at the same section after the Scotland ( 2016 ) Act was passed : Whoa !\nThere is a huge amount of new text here !\nDid the UK Government just reserve a lot more powers ?\nActually no , what they did was un-reserve elections to the Scottish Parliament ( thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of caveats to that such as election timings , donations to political parties and other minutia .\nLet \u2019 s highlight the really important change here , because it \u2019 s quite simple .\nThis is how things were in 2012 : And this is how this portion of the Scotland Act looked after the 2016 revisions : You can see that the first blanket statement no longer includes \u201c the Parliament \u201d ( referring to the Scottish Parliament ) , and it has been moved to a new secondary section \u201c ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list a number of exceptions which the UK Government are still reserving .\nYou can go through the list for yourself if you want , but the crucial point is that legislation on elections in Scotland is no longer a reserved matter .\nIf you have stayed with us this far , thank you , well done , and we \u2019 ll try to speed things up a little bit because we \u2019 re reaching the crucial point which the UK Supreme Court will have to decide .\nAfter the changes were enacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Primary legislation that gave effect to these new powers .\nThis resulted in three new bills going through lengthy drafting , consultation , and scrutiny by cross-party Holyrood committees before being debated in the chamber , amended , passed by the Parliament , and receiving Royal Assent to become Acts of law .\nThey are ; Save for the reservation of UK-wide general elections , these Acts give the Scottish Parliament legislative power over voting in Scotland .\nThey are the legal framework within which all elections and referendums within Scotland \u2013 save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place going forward .\nActs for individual elections and referenda are still required to place detail pertinent to those votes ( such as the dates and specific terms ) , but these will exist within the enabling framework of the above Primary legislation .\nYou can think of these three Acts as being the tracks , and the actual individual election and referendum bills as being the trains that run on them .\nAnd herein lies the crucial difference between 2014 and 2023 ; the Scottish Parliament doesn \u2019 t need a Section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it already has them .\nNow perhaps our section title , \u201c Oh .\nI wish we hadn \u2019 t done that \u201d , may become clear : Westminster politicians are probably wishing that they hadn \u2019 t passed these powers to the Scottish Parliament in 2016 .\nWith these new powers , it \u2019 s possible that the Scottish Parliament can hold an independence referendum not only without a Section 30 order , but against the UK Government \u2019 s wishes !\nLet \u2019 s talk about the case before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 is no longer required to transfer the powers to order an electoral ballot , one is arguably still required because the Union and Parliament are still matters reserved to the UK .\nAgain , here \u2019 s the top of Schedule 5 of the Scotland Act : However , the Scottish Government are arguing that a consultative vote in itself does not bind the UK Government to change either the Union or the Parliament of the United Kingdom .\nSo let \u2019 s bring in the draft Scottish Independence Referendum Bill : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very first provision , Purpose of this Act : \u201c The purpose of this Act is to make provision for ascertaining the views of the people of Scotland on whether Scotland should be an independent country.\n\u201d For ascertaining the views of the people of Scotland .\nThe views .\nThis bill is for a consultative , non-binding vote on Scottish independence .\nLet \u2019 s take also take a look at one of the provisions a little further down : And there is the Referendums ( Scotland ) Act 2020 which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks that this particular train will run on .\nThe Independence Referendum bill itself is quite short , only 5 pages ( we \u2019 ve only shown part of page 1 here ) , because all of the essential legal underpinnings required to order , execute and monitor a referendum are in the Referendums ( Scotland ) 2020 Act .\nIt must be reiterated at this point that the Scottish Government \u2019 s favoured course is still an independence referendum on 19th October 2023 with a Section 30 from the UK Government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 Edinburgh Agreement .\nThis is the \u201c gold standard \u201d that puts the result and effect of a referendum beyond doubt .\nBut absent the Conservative UK Government playing democratic ball , the Scottish Government is prepared to push ahead regardless .\nBut is there a point to a consultative non-binding referendum ?\nWell , in fact all referendums and elections in the UK are non-binding .\nParliament can ignore them , if it so chooses , because in the UK parliament is sovereign , not the people .\nScotland historically takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who matter and that they are sovereign .\nHowever , while part of the UK it \u2019 s the UK rules that apply .\nWhile the UK Government will almost certainly try to ignore a Yes vote in a consultative referendum , it would pile considerable political pressure on them as it would no longer be an academic question , but the Scots have in fact voted to leave .\nThat \u2019 s not something that they can airily wave away as \u201c grievance \u201d or with casual manufactured soundbites .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere would also be considerable diplomatic pressure on the UK Government .\nEurope will be watching , the UK \u2019 s trade partners will be watching , and \u2013 perhaps most importantly \u2013 the United States will be watching .\nOne can hardly champion democratic values across the world if one \u2019 s closest ally is choosing to ignore democracy on its doorstep .\nThe Lord Advocate is Scotland \u2019 s senior law officer for both criminal and civil law , and is the principle legal advisor to the Scottish Government .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government in all civil proceedings .\nThe position is currently held by the Rt .\nHon .\nDorothy Bain QC .\nIt \u2019 s important to note that while the Lord Advocate works for the Scottish Government , she is not bound by the Scottish Government .\nHer position is protected by the Scotland Act , as are Scotland \u2019 s highest courts .\nThey act independently of the Scottish Government , albeit reporting to the Scottish Government .\nIt \u2019 s a long-standing covenant in modern democracies that the court and judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undue influence in criminal and civil cases by politicians .\nThe Lord Advocate \u2019 s counterpart is the Advocate General , the most senior law officer in Scotland representing the UK Government .\nThe Advocate General \u2019 s post is currently held by Lord Stewart of Dirleton QC .\nIn her speech of 28th June announcing the Independence Referendum in 2023 , First Minister Nicola Sturgeon informed the Scottish Parliament that ; \u201c \u2026some weeks ago I asked the Lord Advocate to consider exercising the power she has under paragraph 34 of schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Supreme Court the question of whether the provisions in this Bill relate to reserved matters.\n\u201d The Lord Advocate did consider it , and determined that referring the # indyref2 bill to the Supreme Court for a ruling on whether it was within the competence of the Scottish Parliament to pass was \u201c for the benefit of the Scottish Parliament , the Scottish Government and the people of Scotland ( indeed , people throughout the United Kingdom ) \u201d .\nHer written submission to the Supreme Court was published on Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competence of the parliament based on the Scotland Act , prior case law , applicable parallels from the Welsh and Northern Irish Parliaments , and extensive debates in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords .\nYou can read the entire 51-page submission here .\nTo answer the question \u201c Can Scotland hold # indyref2 without a Section 30 from Westminster ?\n\u201d honestly , we need to split the question into more nuanced enquiries ; \u2022 Prior to 2020 , could Scotland have held # indyref2 without a Section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did not have the legal power required to instruct a nationwide electoral ballot .\nThat power only came after elections were devolved in the Scotland 2016 Act , and the pertinent Acts of the Scottish Parliament gave it effect in January 2020 .\n\u2022 Can Scotland hold a referendum in 2023 without a Section 30 from Westminster ?\n\u2022 Yes .\nThe Scottish Parliament has the power to hold nationwide referenda without the permission of Westminster .\n\u2022 Can Scotland hold a referendum in 2023 on reserved matters without a Section 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the question now before the UK Supreme Court .\nTheir ruling will determine what happens next .\nSupplemental : Can the SNP turn the next general election into a de facto referendum ?\nYou can campaign on any issue in a general election , that is the nature of democracy .\nGiven the SNP \u2019 s dominance of Scottish politics and track record of winning elections , it would be impossible for any other party in the election to ignore a single issue campaign \u2013 and other parties can \u2019 t realistically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a recent precedent for this ; Boris Johnson ran his 2019 general election campaign on a single premise ; \u201c Get Brexit Done \u201d with his \u201c Oven-ready deal \u201d .\nRegardless of how we may feel about that or how his premiership turned out , he was elected with an 80 seat majority and a mandate for his policies .\nWhether a UK government would recognise the result is another matter entirely , but it would be impossible for them to ignore .\nNewsnet needs your help Please support

against the ever rightward march of politics and economic policy at Westminster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devolved nations demands and interests because we are vastly outnumbered in population and elected members to the crumbling mother of Parliaments is the height of arrogance .\nAn arrogance we are unlikely to see any change in under the UK \u2019 s new PM which is more than likely to increase support for independence and belief that a population of 5.3 million can do much better by undertaking our journey to statehood in a pan European partnership of shared interests .\nThe Ofcom News

no longer one of the UK voices that mattered .\nScotland and all who live here had been turfed out into the political arctic by Truss , the most likely next PM .\nSo , at a stroke , it became personal

messing with the Northern Ireland protocol , the refusal to listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % vote to remain in the EU , and numerous other instances when Scotland \u2019 s wishes and voice have been ignored

allowing generators to price supply in relation to the actual cost .\nThis would be a clear benefit to Scotland and other parts of the UK with significant renewable generation .\nCharges should be based on a proven cost base .\nOffshore generation provides the lowest generation costs but onshore wind and solar also make an important contribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit costs and too much fossil fuel generation need to reorient for a more cost effective future with government help .\nBoth Truss and Sunak appear to support the temporary removal of VAT from energy bills .\nIt is important this also

power for decades .\nAnother change of PM is seen by some Tory MPs perhaps more as adviseable rather than necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place there is the overriding need to reassure the markets , and voters , and put the economy on a more stable basis .\nIf an election could be stalled for 18-24 months that breathing space could probably still see the Tories lose but not so spectacularly that they

continuing pressures on the SNHS the Scottish Government did what was necessary and reached a pay settlement with the nurses in Scotland .\nEngland , Wales and Northern Ireland have greater serious pressures because Sunak will not sit down and talk pay .\nThat \u2019 s what a responsible government does .\nThat the Royal College of Nursing have not agreed to the Scottish settlement means getting around the table again .\nSunak is sticking rigidly to refusing direct talks just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exodus of EU nurses and doctors .\nNHS staff are leaving and there is no way to force nurses and doctors to continue to work in an underfunded and under supported public service .\nOne of the most significant health initiatives the Scottish Government introduced was free prescriptions .\nJust because we have become accustomed to this let us never forget we can get our prescriptions when we need them not when we can afford them or have to make another choice between heating and eating .\nThis prevents conditions deteriorating and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more expensive treatment .\nPrescriptions in England now cost \u00a39.35 per item .\nWednesday was the shortest day of the year which means that from Thursday on the days start to get longer again .\nIt may be a slow process with January and February usually the main winter months still before us but even though there may be little cheer ahead for a while that was no reason not to celebrate the Winter Solstice even if it was just lighting a candle .\nWe are on our way back to summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US Fed interest rate policy ?\nThey are pushing interest rates up and it is not just in the US .\nThey are determined to squeeze inflation , push up unemployment by raising the cost of borrowing for struggling businesses and householders squeezed by higher mortgage or rent costs on top of higher energy and food costs .\nRecession is looming and taking what disposable income may be left out of the economy risks a deeper recession .\nThe US Fed sets the pace and Europe and hapless Brexit UK follow suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect the value of their currency against a strong dollar .\nSterling has recovered from the lows following the disastrous Truss government but it remains in an 80 year decline against the dollar and is still lower than the level it fell to following the 2016 Brexit vote .\nThe Bank of England was quick to match all the Fed interest increases but markets were concerned and 2 members of the monetary policy committee voted against another rate increase .\nInterest rates after 9 increases by the BoE now stand at 3.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost to the economy and to UK government borrowing costs .\nThe European Central Bank ( ECB ) was slower to follow the US Fed and interest rates for the Euro area are lower at 2 % amid concerns for the Euro economy .\nIn the end they followed this time with a 0.5 % increase to 2 % but with retail sales falling due to multiple inflation pressures further increases look much less likely over recession concerns .\nBrexit Britain is becoming very vulnerable to the impact of interest rates significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.5 % is a big difference and businesses and households will pay the price of BoE \u2019 s dangerous Fed following .\nVoices on both sides of the pond are calling for a halt to interest rate increases .\nThe increasing cost of food is affecting everyone especially those on lower incomes Blaming Ukraine is wrong .\nThe problem is Putin Angela Merkel once asked Putin what he wanted .\nShe didn \u2019 t get an answer but we now know what it would have been .\nPutin \u2019 s war is against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermine .\nThe steady erosion of Russian influence as former satellites moved increasingly towards the West reduced Russian post war influence in Europe .\nThe Warsaw pact countries have all left .\nTwo things about Putin \u2019 s regime are a continuation of Czarist and Stalinist Russia .\nThose parts of the Russian Empire seeking to make their own way in the world are ruthlessly suppressed and secondly this is achieved by committing large numbers of poorly motivated , ill-equipped and untrained Russians to these conflicts .\nPutin thought he could get away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over in days .\nThe strength and military creativity of the Ukrainian response took Russia and the West by surprise .\nChristmas Eve marks a conflict standing at 10 months not 10 days .\nOther eastern states are also targets of Putin \u2019 s intended revenge , including Moldova and Georgia .\nThere is no choice but to continue to support Ukraine but without putting troops on the ground .\nRussia has displayed extraordinary ineptitude for a supposedly major world power as well as carrying out thousands of war crimes .\nIt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displaying increased efficiency in putting strategic defences in place to help protect areas still under occupation .\nThe loud mouth attention seeking petrol head seems to have had second thoughts and his article that no responsible editor should have published has been taken down .\nIn the real world the Centre for European Reform ( CER ) has been modelling the economic performance of a UK if it had remained in the EU by comparison to the economic performance of other major economies .\nTheir conclusion is Brexit Britain \u2019 s GDP is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been if the UK had remained in the EU .\nAlong with this is the resulting impact of lower tax receipts of \u00a340 billion in the year to the end of June this year .\nGiven current problems across both the private and public sectors that loss of economic growth which would have kept more businesses going and \u00a340 billion of lost tax revenues would have made the present situation a great deal less difficult to the extent that Sunak might even have made a decent pay offer to nurses .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 days last year ( when Chancellor ) investigating private health care in the US .\nSunak only changes direction when he faces a blowback from his hard line Brexiteers and Not In My Backyard PMs .\nIt is not as if the Centre for European Reform \u2019 s calculations are not without similar calculations by the UK \u2019 s Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) who earlier calculated Brexit had resulted in a loss of 4 % of UK GDP .\nThere is speculation that Sunak may face pressure to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local elections in England are bad .\nWe have seen 3 PMs in 2022 .\nCould there be yet another unelected PM change in 2023 ?\nThere is even speculation of Johnson returning .\nEnd of Sunak and Scotland leaving UK for the EU ?\nFaced with an incompetent Sunak government and Starmer \u2019 s Labour and Sunak joined at the hip in a belief Brexit will one day actually work , along with total opposition to Scotland having another independence referendum the ongoing political chaos might actually result in a General election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Channel4 News poll found Scotland wants to get out of the UK and the sooner the better .\nThe net is closing on Trump and republicans are are gradually distancing from the rogue President although there is no certainty that Trump will face a legal challenge that would rule him out of standing for public office again .\nIt will be a long drawn out process .\nSecondly a reminder that Scotland has the highest per capital revenue of the nations and regions of the UK according to the ONS behind only London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marginally the East of England .\nRevenue per head blue areas ; Scotland \u00a311779 , South West England \u00a310934 , East of England \u00a311947 .\nSpending per head in Scotland is higher partly because we have a more distributive government in areas they control and because we have no control of the large expenditure of the UK government which means we get charged for the likes of waste PPE from VIP contracts , Test and Trace ( \u00a338 billion ) and other expenditure by Pretendy Global Britain .\nA real country has total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As long as we remain in the union we will not have control over our own considerable resources or the means to provide the greatest benefit to the people of Scotland .", "author":
