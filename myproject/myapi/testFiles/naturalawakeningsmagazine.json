.\nAttaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feeling overwhelmed , especially if prompting kids to follow their bliss .\nIntegrating mindfulness techniques like meditation , yoga and sensory engagement into a household \u2019 s everyday routines can help to fortify emotional stability when kids experience rough waters .\n\u201c When kids learn to focus on their breathing , it helps to bring their attention to the present moment .\nBy practicing mindfulness daily , these practices become second nature , and kids are able to tap into them whenever they need to .\nBy teaching children these tools at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeds that they will be able to grow and cultivate throughout their lives , \u201d says Maura Bradley , founder of Bee You Yoga and Mindfulness , in Manasquan , New Jersey .\nThe author of

breathwork and mindfulness , first together with a parent or caregiver to get familiar with the practices , and then practice the techniques during non-stressful times.\n\u201d Focusing on grades with a one-size-fits-all educational model poses many problems , and changing times demand a broader , more vibrant paradigm .\nCOVID-19 lockdowns brought radical changes to the classroom , and more than

laboratory , goes beyond math , reading and science , and endorses character-building immersion in community , compassion and culture .\n\u201c Montessori learning stresses the beauty of nature , \u201d says Ruth Tencati , a Montessori teacher in Charlotte , North Carolina .\n\u201c Geography , music , art and practical life skills are taught .\nIdeally , each child is given lessons that

and to see themselves as part of a community of learners , \u201d she says .\nTencati views technology as an ally when it is used to deepen students \u2019 understanding of lessons , but believes it should never be used as a pacifier .\nFamiliarity with the arts is key to a well-rounded view of life , but the number of school-based arts programs has been declining since 1980 due to a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impact of art on children , Rice University researchers ran a randomized controlled trial in 2019 with 10,548 students enrolled in 42 schools in the Houston area .\nThey found that students that participated in the arts at elementary and middle school levels improved their writing skills , increased their compassion for others and were less likely to misbehave in class .\nIn

Museum , Boston Children \u2019 s Museum and the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History bring the past to life with online \u201c field trips \u201d just for kids .\nWhen kids learn about

introduce kids to an expanded worldview , families can enjoy a weekly ethnic meal , go to local heritage festivals and celebrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child lifelong tools includes instilling a healthy respect for good health .\nPositive eating habits have been shown to boost academic performance and lessen the potential for speech and language acquisition delays .\nResearch on laboratory animals by the University of Georgia in 2021 published in Translational Psychiatry showed that sugar consumption in adolescence diminished learning capacity even into adulthood , possibly due to imbalances in gut bacteria .\n\u201c Hundreds of studies identify nutrition as one of the most critical factors in the development of robust brains , \u201d says Lorie Eber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , California .\n\u201c Consumption of whole foods such as eggs ( choline ) , oily fish ( omega-3 fatty acids ) , vegetables ( folate and antioxidants ) , beans ( zinc ) and Greek yogurt ( gut health ) are vital for the healthy development of children \u2019 s brains in the first years of life.\n\u201d Nutrition has a measurable impact on psychological health , she says .\n\u201c Diets high in refined sugars and

your children to develop a healthy relationship with food .\nThat is a rare gift in today \u2019 s food-centric society.\n\u201d Connecting to nature is not only good for growing bodies , but also for self-image .\nA 2018 systematic review of 35 studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Community Health shows time spent outdoors positively impacts young people \u2019 s mental health .\nResearch conducted by the Institute of Education at University College London drives it home even further : Primary school children that connected with nature in brief Wildlife Trust programs felt better about themselves and experienced more positive relationships with their teachers and classmates .\nAdding to Mother Nature \u2019 s feel-good benefits , exercise during childhood and adolescence , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , lowers the risk of depression , improves academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases later in life .\nIn the end , parenting is about doing our best for our children while being human .\n\u201c Being a parent is hard .\nOne of my mantras for myself is \u2018 grace , gratitude and grit , \u2019 \u201d muses Martin .\n\u201c Giving grace to myself by forgiving myself for my parenting mistakes , being grateful for my family and having grit to keep persevering and working hard to build a good life for my family.\n\u201d Each parent \u2019 s formula might be different , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Let a child experience life !\nGive them opportunities to get into nature , play with non-toy items , interact with animals and support their curiosity , \u201d

Paradoxically , getting praised too lavishly can shake children and make them less likely to take risks .\n\u201c Research has shown that extreme praise\u2014using words like \u201c incredible \u201d

praised for positive aspects of their character such as being kind , resourceful or helpful , they are more likely to be generous and openhearted with others .\nResearchers have also found that when

move through the world with greater ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are : \u201c You made that decision very carefully and wisely.\n\u201d \u201c You were very kind in how you made the new girl feel

age on the basis of how extensively our genome is modified by a process called DNA methylation .\nResearchers are now understanding what factors can turn on positive gene expressions and turn off

study on the power of lifestyle and diet to turn back the biological age clock .\nBased upon functional medicine , the program enrolled 18 healthy men between ages 50 and 72 in a target group and 20 in a control group .\nThose in the target group ate a nutrient-rich diet , slept seven hours a night , practiced relaxation techniques and took supplemental probiotics and phytonutrients .\nThey ate

musicians , yoginis , homesteaders and other folks looking to live a simpler life .\nWhen they garden and undertake home repairs , Ashevillans find it easy to cut expenses : They \u2019 ve formed a

Americans are increasingly exploring shared resources and eco-friendly alternatives like thrift stores , flea markets and rummage sales .\nOften aided by online technology , local shared enterprises

people to \u201c cut down on waste and overbuying , while helping out neighbors , \u201d reports The Washington Post .\nTypically , they are staffed by volunteers and supported by nominal , income-based annual fees .\nStarting a tool-lending library begins by connecting with other people in the community , using local online groups and co-op bulletin boards to attract volunteers and donations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clean out their basements , Kane says .\nAs memberships grow , additional tools can be purchased and employees can be hired .\nWebsite design and inventory tracking in Asheville and elsewhere is simplified by the \u201c library of things \u201d software from myTurn .\nAnother way that people share resources is through Little Free Libraries\u2014the charming \u201c library on a stick \u201d boxes on neighborhood posts and fences that give away books to passersby .\nIt began in Hudson , Wisconsin , in 2009 , when Todd Bol built a tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribute to his deceased mother , an educator and voracious reader .\nHe stocked it with books and put it on a post in his front yard for neighbors and friends .\nThe concept became so popular that he built more and gave them away .\nToday , more than 150,000 Little Free Libraries are found in communities worldwide .\nWhether housed in a local storefront or existing digitally online , resale shops have become big business due to pandemic-inspired decluttering and belt-tightening pursuits .\nIndustry analysts expect thrift store clothing sales to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion and to be worth twice as much , at $ 84

secondhand items .\nAlthough they make shopping more convenient , online sites carry risks : In 2019 , the Federal Trade Commission reported more than 173,000 instances of online shopping fraud .\nWhen shopping online for secondhand items , experts advise , it \u2019 s wise to shop and pay on a trusted website or app , and to avoid using a personal debit card .\nBe sure there are photos of the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Facebook , check each seller \u2019 s rating and thoroughly review all buyers \u2019 comments before making a purchase .\nWith a little enterprise , savvy and flexibility , mass consumerism can be circumvented by sharing community resources and frequenting quality secondhand stores .\nAs Kane puts it , \u201c The sharing economy is essentially about leading a less

cortex is still in development .\nAt the same time , neuroplasticity , the ability of the brain to grow , change and adapt at any point in life , is also at play .\nSo , adolescence is a wonderful moment to introduce teens to coping strategies they can use throughout their life , whether that \u2019 s mindfulness , different types of emotional regulations , storytelling activities , meditation , journaling or yoga.\n\u201d Expressive writing ( journaling using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous system , which in turn lowers that stress response and creates physiological relief , Collins notes , adding , \u201c Scientific data suggests that the metacognition involved in identifying feelings and writing feeling-based words in narratives improves immune and liver function , elicits higher quality-of-life scores and improves psychological well-being.\n\u201d When we lose a loved one , we lose what psychologists call hidden regulators\u2014sensory facets that subconsciously make us feel that things are okay in the world .\nIt could be the sound of a parent \u2019 s car pulling into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a loved one \u2019 s cologne .\nCollins says that teachers and parents can counterbalance a destabilizing loss by introducing routine and predictability in children \u2019 s schedules , perhaps starting class the same way every day with a five-minute free-write , or scheduling regular visits with a special mentor or relative every Saturday .\nKids come to rely on such anchors in times of stress , upheaval and loss .\nCollins suggests that caring adults shift their mindset away from being a savior , because grief is not something to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a facilitator of connection .\n\u201c Think about what form of outlet might resonate with young people and shift the onus away from one adult being the person that says and does the right thing , and instead wrapping a community around them for support , \u201d she says .\nHelpful resources include mental health professionals ; youth engagement programs where kids experiencing loss can share and learn from each other ; and activities that offer release and friendship , such as theater , dance , sports or music .\nAdults should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume they know what \u2019 s best for a grieving child , Collins counsels .\n\u201c Ask open-ended questions like , \u2018 What would be most helpful to you in this moment ?\n\u2019 or , \u2018 What makes you feel calm or connected ?\n\u2019 Find ways to inspire introspection and reflection without telling young people that we know the answer.\n\u201d Making space to remember a lost loved one or to honor something we \u2019 ve lost can be healing for both kids and adults .\nCollins suggests that we ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorialize a loss , preferably in community .\nMaybe they want to plant a tree in honor of someone \u2019 s memory or create a fundraiser for a cause that the loved one cared about .\nUltimately , the greatest gift we can give grieving children is our presence .\nAccording to Collins , one of the best predictors of adjustment is a psychological concept called \u201c perceived support availability.\n\u201d

preservation .\nMiddle and Far Eastern cultures have used the sun and wind to dry foods since 12,000 B.C.\n, according to the National Center for Home Food Preservation ( NCHFP ) .\nToday , the easy availability of food dehydrators offers a convenient way to preserve the fall harvest .\nWhen done correctly , dehydrating food is a safe method for maintaining its original state , says Tracey Brigman , NCHFP associate director and University of Georgia clinical assistant professor .\n\u201c Dehydrators remove the water content in foods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spoilage.\n\u201d Unlike other food preservation methods such as canning or fermenting , dehydrating food does not require lots of special equipment , tools or skill .\n\u201c Dehydrating food is super easy to do , \u201d says Carole Cancler , the Hawaii-based author of the Complete Dehydrator Cookbook .\n\u201c Drying food is more forgiving .\nYou can \u2019 t make a lot of mistakes .\nCanning , if you do it wrong , can make everyone in your family sick.\n\u201d The only caveat , Cancler says , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn humid environments , dehydrated foods must be kept tightly sealed to keep out moisture and prevent mold from forming .\nJulia Skinner , founder and director of Root , an online fermentation and food history company , adds that when foods are dehydrated , they shrink and therefore take up less storage space .\n\u201c They \u2019 re great to pack for traveling or for small kitchens .\nDehydrating can also concentrate some flavors , such as with dried tomatoes.\n\u201d Almost Anything Can be Dehydrated Many types of food can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meat , fish , herbs and nuts .\n\u201c It \u2019 s easier to say what can \u2019 t be dehydrated , \u201d Cancler says .\n\u201c The general rule is you don \u2019 t want to dehydrate food that has a high fat content , such as fatty meats or avocados.\n\u201d They go rancid quickly during storage .\nWhile there are dehydrated , high-fat foods sold commercially such as cheese , peanut butter and eggs , these are processed using special equipment and techniques that can \u2019 t be copied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chopped onions or celery are good foods for beginners .\n\u201c People tend to throw those foods away a lot .\nThey buy them and don \u2019 t use it all up before they spoil .\nDehydrate leftover strawberries for snacks and dehydrate vegetables to use in soups or stews , \u201d Cancler suggests .\nStarter model home food dehydrators , often found at resale stores or rummage sales , can be purchased for about $ 50 .\nSome have adjustable temperature settings for different kinds of foods .\nWhen purchased new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhen using a dehydrator , Skinner advises , turn it on to the appropriate setting and lay the food in a single layer on the trays provided , then let the dehydrator run for a few hours .\nShe usually turns food halfway through to prevent sticking .\nCancler says that in some cases an oven can be used to dehydrate food , but it isn \u2019 t the most cost-effective method .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t recommend continued use of the oven , because depending on where you live and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried , drying can take anywhere from eight to 36 hours .\nRunning an electric or gas range for that long uses a lot of energy.\n\u201d She says that ideal temperatures are 125 to 135 degrees , but most standard ovens only go as low as 170 degrees , which is too warm to dehydrate fruits or vegetables .\n\u201c Then you must do wacky things like prop the door open to cool down the oven.\n\u201d The exception , she says , is jerky : \u201c It must be dried at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dehydrator models don \u2019 t get hot enough.\n\u201d Sun-drying foods outdoors is risky , Brigman cautions , due to varied weather conditions .\nIn addition , insects and air pollution have to be considered .\n\u201c For safety reasons , consumers should really purchase a food dehydrator .\nWhile it may be a high cost when you begin dehydrating , if you are a serious food preserver , it will save you money in the long term , \u201d she says .\nSheila Julson is a freelance writer and regular contributor to @ @

.\nShe provides a discerning guide to the sometimes perilous paths available to patients when wellness fads , lifestyle changes and doctors have failed them .\nWhat motivated you to write Sacred Medicine ?\nAfter 14 years of studying and practicing conventional medicine , I left it at age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morally injured \u201d by the limitations of conventional medicine and the U.S. health care system , which give lip service to a patient \u2019 s well-being and ultimately are about the financial bottom line .\nI never lost respect for the life-saving aspects of conventional medicine .\nI simply believed it shouldn \u2019 t be the only medicine in my medicine bag .\nIt only took me nine months to realize that I could quit my job as an Ob-Gyn , but I couldn \u2019 t quit my calling .\nThat which drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still alive in me .\nI began spiritually seeking to find out what else heals .\nDuring my years of studying and practicing everything along the health , wellness , psychology , yoga and spirituality gamut , I tried many things , cherry-picking from various spiritual traditions , Eastern religions and New Age spirituality .\nNone of these quite fit either .\nI found as much shadow in this camp as I did in the conventional medicine camp .\nWhy use a carefully balanced brew of several healing interventions ?\nLimiting how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the other could prevent you from having the best possible health outcome .\nThere \u2019 s light and shadow in both camps .\nMy book helps educate readers so they can practice discernment and make wise choices about which tools from the world \u2019 s medicine bag serves them best .\nIt \u2019 s meant to help them become more miracle-prone and hopefully to embrace the paradoxes of healing , one of which is : You

potentially curative treatments with their conventional medical doctor .\nBut those treatments often don \u2019 t cure either , so I really see it that individuals don \u2019 t have to choose one or the other .\nRather , they can choose conventional medicine and sacred medicine .\nWhat \u2019 s the difference between curing and healing ?\nGenerally , curing is about the elimination of all evidence of disease .\nHealing is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word \u201c heal \u201d is based upon .\nWhen I \u2019 ve been present with people during end-of-life care , I \u2019 ve witnessed the restoration of wholeness in the tying up of the loose ends of a well-lived life or a life not so well-lived , even in the presence of physical decline .\nRepair , healing and forgiveness in both internal and external relationships in our lives can come from doing deep shadow work .\nWhat are our whole health intelligences ?\nBecause healing is a return to wholeness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intuitive , emotional and somatic\u2014must be the foundational part of your healing journey to create conditions which make the body miracle-prone .\nI think of the work of integrating them as I do a symphony that requires a conductor to arrange and harmonize the intelligences .\nI call the conductor the \u201c inner pilot light \u201d .\nFor example , if we \u2019 re making medical decisions or any significant decision , it \u2019 s important to consult all the intelligences .\nConsider not only what the mind is telling you about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the science shows , but what intuition is telling you about what might be in your best interests .\nOr consider what your gut or other aspects of your body are feeling .\nIt \u2019 s not only the gut that can give us somatic intelligence .\nWe can tune into various intelligences all over our body .\nSome healers I \u2019 ve met are finely tuned into this kind of intelligence to the point that they can ask a \u201c yes \u201d or \u201c no \u201d question and feel the answer somatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ways to guide themselves and their clients .\nWhat part does trauma play in sacred medicine ?\nAlthough trauma as a cause of physical disease might be disputed by skeptics who resist information that contradicts their worldview , the body of scientific data linking psychological trauma and both pediatric and adult-onset disease is airtight .\nAccording to so many sources in the mainstream medical literature , anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of illnesses have stress-related emotional underpinnings .\nWhat causes stress ?\nTrauma does .",

quite like the pandemic .\nStuck at home isolating , many families reconfigured their living arrangements to accommodate expanding uses for work , schooling , cooking , entertainment and more .\nToday , that spirit of renewal lingers , prompting steady and robust activity in the construction and interior design industries .\nA house is literally our shelter from the storm , made more critical as we increasingly encounter extreme and unprecedented weather events due to climate change .\nWhen we upgrade , remodel , build or buy new cocoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripe to incorporate elements that preserve and promote the health of humans and the planet .\nLindsay Baker , CEO of the International Living Future Institute ( ILFI ) , is part of a growing community of industry professionals trying to figure out how to design , build and operate structures in more environmentally sustainable , socially impactful and healthy ways .\n\u201c We ask what would it look like if a building were to give back more to the world than it took , \u201d she explains .\n\u201c We \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footprint .\nForty percent of global carbon emissions are caused by the energy required to construct and operate buildings .\nWe also use lots of materials that pose negative impacts on people \u2019 s health\u2014products known to contain carcinogens or cause respiratory problems\u2014and people spend 90 percent of their time indoors , so everything we \u2019 re exposed to indoors has a huge impact on our health.\n\u201d The ILFI Living Building Challenge sets bold aspirational goals , and buildings around the world have proven that it is possible to hit these benchmarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building produces more energy than it consumes , and that happens by generating renewable energy like solar power onsite and using very little energy , \u201d Baker asserts .\n\u201c For water , we ask that everyone return the water that goes through the building cleaner than it entered , which means people need to treat water onsite and use a lot less of it .\nYou can do that with composting toilets , as well as grey water systems and rainwater recapture strategies.\n\u201d Baker is proud of ILFI \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do a renovation to save 5 or 10 percent of your water or energy consumption , it will feel good to get there , but what we \u2019 ve found is that when you set a really exciting target for yourself , the whole process is more fun and you get further with similar amounts of effort and money , because you \u2019 re thinking about systems differently , questioning assumptions about what a home might be capable of doing and employing a different level of creativity .\nAt the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much more beautiful , more efficient building.\n\u201d Energy conservation is job number one for Jennifer Languell , founder and president of Trifecta Construction Solutions , in Babcock Ranch , Florida .\n\u201c An inexpensive but impactful upgrade is adding insulation .\nIf you \u2019 re in an existing house , add insulation on top of what you already have .\nIf you \u2019 re new construction , beef it up .\nYou also want to address unwanted points of air infiltration using gaskets , weather stripping and caulking around exterior doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items can shrink or get damaged , and may need to be replaced to seal the house and minimize air drafts , \u201d she says .\n\u201c You want to improve efficiency first , which costs much less than transitioning to renewable energy .\nAnd when you do transition , you only have to buy smaller quantities of photovoltaic panels to offset your power generation.\n\u201d According to Languell , windows are climate-specific and can be modified by adding or subtracting panes , coatings and treatments .\n\u201c In Montana , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my house , but in Florida , I don \u2019 t , \u201d she says .\n\u201c Natural light is great , but there \u2019 s a balance between your glass-to-wall ratio .\nIn Florida , you would never have a skylight , but up north you \u2019 d consider it .\nAnd at this point , everyone should be transitioning to LED lighting , which will save money and energy.\n\u201d As waterways dry up and areas around the world become more drought-prone , water conservation becomes an increasingly important imperative .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , toilets and faucets , which cost the same as traditional-flow fixtures , as well as a visit from the plumber to fix any leaks .\nMinimizing or eliminating turf grass and planting drought-tolerant , native vegetation outside will also significantly cut water use , Languell suggests .\n\u201c Grey water and rainwater collection systems are gaining momentum , and these systems for home use have come leaps and bounds from where they were 10 years ago , \u201d she says .\n\u201c They can take water from your laundry or shower , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flush toilets , for example\u2014a huge benefit for the West Coast and a huge water savings , because you \u2019 re using your water twice before you dispose of it.\n\u201d With regard to building materials and products , the annual ILFI Red List calls out chemicals with negative human health impacts that shouldn \u2019 t be used in buildings , such as bisphenol A , chlorofluorocarbons , formaldehyde , flame retardants , phthalates , toxic heavy metals and volatile organic compounds ( VOC ) .\nIts Declare label is like a nutrition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building product , whether it is free of Red List chemicals and what its carbon footprint is .\n\u201c Consumers should demand transparency ; they should know what is in the products put in their homes , \u201d Baker says .\n\u201c One of the rules of thumb I like to apply is to ask , \u2018 How far is this material removed from nature ?\n\u2019 Wood is one of the better materials from an ecological and health standpoint .\nFake wood flooring that is meant to look like wood but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot of what we \u2019 re supporting is about getting back to the basics , removing chemicals and using brick , wood and clay.\n\u201d According to Languell , the more durable and local a material is , the better for the environment .\n\u201c I \u2019 d never say no to a metal or concrete roof that lasts 50 years versus shingles with a 15-year cycle .\nAlthough bamboo is rapidly renewable , most of it comes from China , so the greenhouse gases associated with the transportation makes it less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe closer the better .\nGet granite from Georgia , instead of Italy.\n\u201d When it comes to human health , home d\u00e9cor and cleaning products are equally as important as the construction materials , Languell advises .\n\u201c Many times we \u2019 ll build a healthy and efficient home and then people put all sorts of fabrics and chemicals in there that are off-gassing because they \u2019 re not thinking about the health of the indoor environment.\n\u201d \u201c There \u2019 s good , better and best quality furniture , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City eco-designer and founder of Robin Wilson Home .\n\u201c Good might use inexpensive wood or heavy-duty cardboards that look great , but if you sit on the arm of the sofa , it caves in .\nBetter might have a less expensive wood , but it \u2019 s solid frame construction .\nThe best is a very good wood and solid frame construction made for heirloom quality .\nThere are costs associated with each level , and I recommend spending the most budget you have on a quality product , because that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well and it \u2019 s styled in a classic design , can be recovered over and over again ; therefore , you \u2019 re being eco-friendly to the world because it \u2019 s not going into a landfill.\n\u201d Her favorite materials for furnishings are sustainably forested or reclaimed wood , long-lasting metals like steel and aluminum , fast-growing bamboo and recycled or reclaimed plastics .\nShe \u2019 s also a proponent of vintage pieces .\n\u201c With all furniture , if it can be salvaged , salvage it .\nHealthwise , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you from allergens .\nOld glazes or paints might have lead in them , so take vintage furniture to a professional that uses the right safety equipment or go to YouTube University and make sure that you protect yourself with gear to rework the piece in a garage or outdoor space .\nAlways choose nontoxic paints and stains with low to no VOCs.\n\u201d Baker is particularly excited about interior design innovations that reconnect us to nature , known as biophilic design .\n\u201c Natural light is important , but also , lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighting that feels like you \u2019 re sitting outside in a forest while a cloud passes by or under a tree with dappled light .\nMohawk and Interface offer low-carbon , healthy carpets that mimic natural forms like a rocky beach , \u201d she says .\n\u201c Fractals are often mentioned in biophilic design because they \u2019 re fascinating geometric compositions in nature like fly wings and bark that have an inherent intelligence to them , and we \u2019 ve come to understand that these natural elements are not just interesting , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psyche and mental health.\n\u201d \u201c I rate durability over everything else .\nIf you build it once and it doesn \u2019 t get destroyed by a natural disaster , you \u2019 re going to generate less waste and use fewer resources , \u201d Languell says .\n\u201c Durability might mean fireproofing in California , windproofing in Florida and floodproofing in Louisiana .\nIt also means futureproofing your home , especially if you \u2019 re building new .\nAnticipate technologies that are coming .\nEven if you can \u2019 t afford photovoltaic panels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can run electric conduit from your panel up to your roof so if ever you decide to buy them , it \u2019 s not a major overhaul of your house .\nDual-pipe your house and have the pipes ready to tie in rainwater or grey water , even if it \u2019 s not financially viable right now .\nWire your house for a 220-volt plug in your garage so everyone that has an electric vehicle can charge it overnight.\n\u201d

wider perspective , building resilience through self-care and taking individual steps to make a collective difference .\nAs the Dalai Lama encourages , \u201c If you think you are too small to make a difference , try sleeping with a mosquito !\n\u201d News reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our brains , journalists often see their function as focusing on threats to alert us to dangers .\n\u201c Still , if you take the long view of history , we are much better off than we were 200 years ago or 1,000 years ago , but it took many years to make those changes , \u201d counsels Robert L. Leahy , Ph.D. , director of the American Institute for Cognitive Therapy and author of the bestselling The Worry Cure and the upcoming If Only .\n\u201c We never know if something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data , and we seldom have all the data , \u201d he says .\n\u201c And when it comes to political emotions , many of the predictions that are made by the \u2018 talking heads \u2019 in media never come true.\n\u201d Leahy counsels patience : \u201c Social change does not come about by one person doing something .\nThat usually comes about by a long process of millions of people changing their attitudes and changing their behavior .\nSmall efforts can be made on a daily basis that move this slow process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer view , rather than expect immediate change.\n\u201d In this ongoing process , anxiety has its rightful place .\n\u201c Anxiety makes us look around , figure out solutions and act .\nThis can absolutely be turned into something positive , \u201d says neuropsychologist Barbara Easterlin , of Jackson , Wyoming , an expert on eco-anxiety who is on the steering committee of the Climate Psychology Alliance of North America .\n\u201c Doing just one thing to help the planet consistently helps defeat anxiety.\n\u201d Taking action moves us into our power\u2014as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign outside the Swedish parliament .\nPersonal actions matter because numbers add up .\nOnly 25 percent of individuals in a social group need to make a shift before significant social change follows , conclude researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science that analyzed a decade of societal changes in voting , health , technology and finance .\nOnce a group reaches that tipping point , it can trigger a change in the rest of society , says study author Damon Centola , Ph.D. , author of Change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFears about the shape of the planet and nation are often piled on top of our everyday living anxieties about family and finances , which can induce emotional overload .\n\u201c We all have a \u2018 zone of resilience \u2019 or \u2018 window of tolerance \u2019 , outside of which we become more reactive , less able to function effectively .\nBut it is not fixed .\nWe can learn tools to expand it and cultivate the capacity to be with more , \u201d says Easterlin .\nTherapy can be a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine \u201c the mental narratives that can exacerbate distress , \u201d says Leslie Davenport , a climate psychology consultant and author of Emotional Resiliency in the Era of Climate Change .\nIt \u2019 s

Psychology Association and the California Institute of Integral Studies to train therapists in treating eco-anxiety .\nFor low-cost online support , the Good Grief Network offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process personal anxiety and grief about climate change .\nPeople are also sitting down to share their distress at climate cafes , small local gatherings springing up across the country and globe , including some online .\nGetting enough sleep , eating healthy and exercising are also key self-care strategies .\nWhen anxiety strikes , psychologists advise shifting attention from the head to the body , using such approaches as mindful breathing , dancing and grounding .\nMeditation , easily accessed these days through apps like Calm and Headspace , helps us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call \u201c the still point within.\n\u201d Rather than \u201c doomscrolling \u201d when anxiety mounts , cutting back our media use can significantly lower stress levels , studies show .\nWise media strategies include choosing well-established , credible news sources ; reading rather than watching the news to lower its emotional impact ; limiting news intake to 10 minutes once or twice a day ; taking a \u201c news fast \u201d on occasion ; and passing up sources that incessantly feed fury .\nOn the other hand , it \u2019 s essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important in recovery from anxiety disorders , according to a study in Behavior Therapy .\nGoogling \u201c good news on climate change \u201d will bring up articles about alternative energy growth , new super-enzymes that eat plastic rubbish and black rhinos coming back from the brink of extinction .\nAlthough dystopic books abound , others offer hope , such as Drawdown , with its sensible , scaled-down strategies to stop global warming by 2050 .\nVirtually no one can take on all the problems of the nation and globe at once\u2014and the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public office , we don \u2019 t have to .\nInstead , \u201c In taking action , focus on what you are good at , what your sphere of influence might be , \u201d advises Lewis .\n\u201c What are you most heartbroken over ?\nGet involved in that and allow yourself to feel really good about what you \u2019 re doing and other people are doing.\n\u201d By narrowing our focus , we can hone in on an issue and figure out our part in its solution .\n\u201c We need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d says Davenport .\n\u201c For climate change , a teacher could bring social-emotional learning to climate education into the classroom or start an after school \u2018 green club \u2019 ; an artist could use their creative medium to communicate about climate in a moving way that could engage others ; a nurse could create a waste-reduction initiative within a medical setting .\nThese efforts all have ripple effects and help to elevate each other.\n\u201d In one recent study , people were found to consume less energy if they believed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservation .\nOur neighborhoods are the place to take the small , meaningful steps that address the \u201c crisis of connection \u201d underlying rancorous national crises , says New York Times columnist David Brooks .\nHe advocates \u201c radical mutuality \u201d , saying , \u201c Nothing we do , however virtuous , can be accomplished alone.\n\u201d Through simple actions like having casual conversations around town , pitching in to help a family in crisis , bringing a salad to a block party , tutoring a child or holding a civic post , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthen communities .\nAs we meet others that feel as strongly as we do about our issues , our numbers start building and collective action can unfold .\n\u201c Independent of political beliefs , many people can find common values such as wanting safety for their families , a clean environment with clean waterways and recreation in natural environments , \u201d says Easterlin .\nThat , in turn , helps lower our distress .\nA recent Yale study found that eco-anxiety was linked to depression only among students not involved in group activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being part of an environmental group , working in a letter-writing campaign or going to events or protests did not spiral downward emotionally .\n\u201c Personal transformation and social transformation happen simultaneously .\nWhen you reach out and build community , you nourish yourself , \u201d Brooks says .\nAs Thunberg has put it : \u201c When I \u2019 m taking action , I don \u2019 t feel like I am helpless and that things are hopeless , because then I feel like I \u2019 m doing everything I can .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially to see all the other people all around the world , the activists , who are taking action and who are fighting for their present and for their future.\n\u201d Health

support the person in the process of creation and allows the person to utilize their other senses to express themselves.\n\u201d Celeste Wade , an art psychotherapist at the Child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haverford , Pennsylvania , emphasizes that emotional processing can not occur when an individual is on the alert for potential danger , a physiological response from an overstimulated amygdala .\n\u201c Trauma needs to be processed for the client to gain mastery and function in a calm state versus fight , flight or freeze .\nArt making can also activate this area of the brain and have calming effects to counteract trauma responses , \u201d she says .\nThe art therapist provides a nourishing presence without art instruction or critiquing , and sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting or include family members .\nConversation , combined with art making , is typical in any art therapy session .\nSchindler stresses that creating pretty images is not the goal of an art therapy session and dispels the common assumption that \u201c the person attending art therapy needs to have either a talent in art or an interest in art .\nThey just need the willingness to participate in a session.\n\u201d Some children see immediate benefits , while others realize emotional progress after several sessions .\nArt therapy , sometimes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives children a voice , but provides

ages and skill levels .\nAccording to the National Ski Areas Association , there were 61 million ski resort visits during the 2021-2022 season , a 3.5 percent increase over the previous season .\nA

slope .\nTight-fitting , stiff ski boots are necessary to provide the most direct intention of energy to either ski .\nAlways be alert .\nTo avoid collisions , look before turning and listen for skiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slope from behind .\nAll that \u2019 s needed is a few inches of snow for a recreational playground .\nAlong with snowshoeing , cross-country skiing is a serene and quiet connection with nature .\nSome hardcore aficionados take multi-day backcountry or mountainous treks along marked trails with overnight stays in lodges , huts and cabins that may provide ski equipment .\nCross-country skiers glide on thinner skis over relatively flat terrain with their weight slightly forward and evenly distributed over both skis , moving in a scissors-like motion akin to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long gait .\nOnly the toe in a sneaker-like boot is attached to the ski \u2019 s binding , so skiers lift up with each arm , planting a pole and pushing on it , and a fuller gliding motion is attained .\nOverall , it \u2019 s a highly aerobic exercise facilitating an extensive workout for arms and legs .\nMany park and recreation departments and sporting goods retailers put on winter festivals that feature the activity .\nNext year \u2019 s Slumberland American Birkebeiner , North America \u2019 s largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Cable to Hayward , Wisconsin , is expected to attract

.\nThey \u2019 re even coming down in rain , \u201d says Mike Schade , director of the Mind the Store program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based in Seattle .\n\u201c This is a growing public health crisis.\n\u201d A recent Environmental Working Group report says that 200 million Americans are likely drinking water contaminated with PFAS , and that these chemicals are even more toxic than once thought .\nIn June , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) established new health advisories for these chemicals , warning about the toxicity of even lower amounts in water .\nThe EPA is offering $ 1 billion in grants initially and $ 5 billion over time to help remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also shown PFAS detected in sludge used as fertilizer in home gardens .\n\u201c We need action at all levels of government , \u201d Schade says .\n\u201c We need states to step up .\nWe need Congress to step up .\nWe need big companies to step up and consumers to take action.\n\u201d Since the late 1940s , forever chemicals have been manufactured for use in products such as nonstick cookware ; waterproof , water-resistant and stain-resistant textiles ; dental floss ; and food packaging , such as microwave popcorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use foam that contains the chemicals .\n\u201c Production and disposal of these chemicals is leading to the contamination of drinking water supplies and surface water bodies all across the country , \u201d Schade says .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a huge issue , especially in the Great Lakes.\n\u201d \u201c We \u2019 re talking about more than 9,000 chemicals , \u201d says Susie Dai , Ph.D. , a leading PFAS researcher and an associate professor of plant pathology and microbiology at Texas A & M University .\n\u201c Because they contain one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon-fluorine bond , they are very stable .\nThat makes it difficult for the chemicals to break down and easy for them to accumulate in the environment.\n\u201d Several years ago , chemical companies began manufacturing what they deem are less-toxic PFAS .\nThey \u2019 re known as either short-chain or alternative PFAS , and include chemicals named GenX and PFBS .\n\u201c The more that scientists study this very large class of chemicals , the more that scientists find the replacement chemicals are likely just as toxic , \u201d Schade says .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ two new PFAS .\nMeanwhile , as public concern grows , 11 states have banned PFAS in food packaging , and Congress is considering a similar ban , says Schade .\nWhole Foods Market has stopped using the chemicals in food packaging , and Keen , an outdoor shoe brand , has phased out use of PFAS in their products .\nIn February , Toxic-Free Future sent rain jackets , hiking pants , cloth napkins , bedding and other products marked as stain- or water-resistant to independent labs for analysis .\n\u201c Seventy-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Schade says .\nSome of these products are manufactured by recreational equipment company REI , which Toxic-Free is urging consumers to write to , asking it to end the practice .\nIn July , Columbia Sportswear received petitions with 48,000 signatures from the Natural Resources Defense Council and other environmental organizations urging the company to eliminate PFAS from its products .\nAlthough it has begun taking steps , Columbia has yet to set a timeline or define PFAS sustainability standards .\n\u201c We can minimize the threat of PFAS contamination by turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d says Paloma Paez-Coombe , an associate of Environment Illinois , which participated in the petition drive .\n\u201c One of the best ways we can do that is by getting a major brand like Columbia Sportswear to publicly lead the way.\n\u201d These actions , however , won \u2019 t fix the problem of PFAS already in drinking water .\nDai and other researchers have created a new bioremediation technology using plant-based material and fungi that could clean places where forever chemicals have been disposed .\nShe hopes a similar concept can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northwestern University researchers published a paper in August in Science showing PFAS can be destroyed using somewhat harmless chemicals called sodium hydroxide , which is the lye used to make soap , and dimethyl sulfoxide , a medicine for bladder issues .\nDai says that before these new approaches , the only way to break down PFAS was to expose them to high temperatures in an incinerator , but that is costly and still introduces harmful chemicals into the environment .\nMeanwhile , the Delaware-based chemical company Chemours , a spinoff of Dupont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawsuit against the EPA saying the agency \u2019 s most recent health advisory regarding PFAS is based on flawed science .\nChemours is the same company that has been ordered to pay a $ 12 million fine to the state of North Carolina after contaminating waterways with PFAS .\nSchade surmises , \u201c This is an issue that should be of concern to every American , especially when these chemicals are linked to health problems that are on the rise in our communities.\n\u201d Sheryl DeVore has written six books on science , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health and environmental stories for national

you eat , \u201d but the connection is more than just physical because food impacts our mood , too .\nDuring the last decade , there have been an increasing number of studies exploring what \u2019 s called the gut-brain axis and the role that microorganisms in the gut play in mental health conditions like anxiety , stress , depression and other disorders .\nDepression is a leading cause of disability in the U.S. and worldwide .\nThere are long-held views in medicine that depression is caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that plays a key role in regulating mood and other functions like digestion and sleep .\nThese beliefs resulted in decades of extensive use of antidepressants , most of which boost serotonin in the brain .\nHowever , research by University College London , published in July in the journal Molecular Psychology , found \u201c no consistent evidence of there being an association between serotonin and depression , and no support for the hypothesis that depression is caused by lowered serotonin activity or concentrations.\n\u201d Michael Gershon , M.D.\n, a Columbia University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and author of The Second Brain , has explained to psychologists that \u201c scientists were shocked to learn \u201d that about 90 percent of serotonin is not created in the brain , but is actually produced in the gut and carried from there to the brain , not the other way around .\nThis relationship is called the gut-brain axis .\nA recent literature review of 26 studies suggests that imbalances in gut bacteria can disrupt the two-way communication along the gut-brain axis , leading to depression and other psychiatric issues .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health , \u201d says Bhavna Barmi , Ph.D. , a senior clinical psychologist , relationship therapist and founder of the New Delhi-based Happiness Studio .\n\u201c The traditional belief that only psychiatry and talk therapy can treat mental health has widened to include lifestyle and food , too.\n\u201d \u201c The truth is that our food is the primary contributor of the quality and diversity of bacteria in the microbiome , \u201d says Ishi Khosla , a clinical nutritionist and president of the Celiac Society of India .\n\u201c There is an intricate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Food sensitivities , alcohol and highly processed , refined and sugary foods can lead to a lower diversity of good bacteria and increases in bad bacteria in the gut , which can trigger gut inflammation and unfavorable health conditions .\nMost mood-related disorders start with inflammation of the brain as a response to inflammation in the gut .\n\u201c Certain foods , like gluten , can cause an inflammatory response in the gut .\nOver time , sensitivities to gluten and other foods can lead to a \u2018 leaky gut \u2019 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lets toxins into the bloodstream .\nOften , if it remains unresolved , it leads to mood-related disorders and other chronic health conditions , \u201d says Khosla .\nClinical nutritionists and other practitioners use biochemical markers and food sensitivity tests to help identify food ingredients that trigger inflammation in patients .\nHowever , if a leaky gut is present , a food sensitivity test may not be very accurate .\nAs Tom O \u2019 Bryan , DC , chief health officer of KnoWEwell , explains in his bestselling book The Autoimmune Fix , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a practitioner may do a 90-food testing panel that comes back sensitive to 20 or 25 different foods .\nAnd then the patient exclaims , \u2018 Oh my God , that \u2019 s everything I eat.\n\u2019 Well , of course it is , because your immune system is doing what it is supposed to do\u2014protecting you from toxins .\nOnce the inflammation in the gut is reduced through the elimination of wheat and other offensive foods , and the implementation of a personalized diet and protocol to heal the gut [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing panel will correctly identify those few ingredients to permanently avoid.\n\u201d Kelly Brogan , M.D.\n, a holistic psychiatrist and author of The New York Times bestsellers A Mind of Your Own and Own Your Self , as well as co-editor of the landmark textbook Integrative Therapies for Depression , recommends making three dietary changes to lift mood : Eating foods that are fresh , whole , simple and organic when available fuels good gut bacteria and eliminates the toxins found in packaged foods such as hydrogenated vegetable oils , preservatives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugars that can upset the proper balance in the gut .\nA powerful mood regulator is the omega-3 fatty acid found in such cold-water fish as salmon and trout or taken as a dietary supplement .\nThese fatty acids regulate neurotransmission and gene expression , act as antioxidants and have potent anti-inflammatory properties .\nGood fats from pasture-raised meats , wild fish , eggs , nuts , seeds , olive oil , coconut oil and grass-fed ghee also contribute to mood regulation .\n\u201c Resetting the gut through good bacteria in probiotics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a powerful tool to fight mood disorders , \u201d says Khosla .\nFermented foods such as sauerkraut , pickles ( truly fermented , not just cured in vinegar ) , kimchi and coconut kefir are natural sources of probiotics .\nThey are delicious and easy to make at home .\nA 2018 University of Toronto study in the World Journal of Psychiatry identified 12 nutrients to prevent and treat depressive disorders and found that the following foods had the highest levels of those beneficial nutrients : bivalves such as oysters and mussels ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crab and tuna ; organ meats ; leafy greens ; lettuces ; fresh herbs ; peppers ; and cruciferous vegetables such as cauliflower and broccoli .\nChoosing what to eat is complex and affected by culture , cost , environment and taste preferences .\nDietary changes can be difficult and take time , and those suffering from mood swings , depression or anxiety have additional challenges in making changes .\nNutritionists advise starting small by incorporating one or two foods rich in beneficial nutrients and eliminating a highly processed or packaged food or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of red , yellow , orange and green foods into meals .\n\u201c Food therapy to improve mood is inexpensive , free of side effects and can begin to show results within days , \u201d says Khosla .\nIn view of the gut-brain axis , says Barmi , \u201c It is imperative that from this point on , nutritionists , psychiatrists and psychotherapists work together for holistic care of the client to lead to maximum benefit.\n\u201d

surrounded by millions of pathogens , bacteria , viruses\u2014inside and outside of our bodies\u2014that become invaders when something breaks down in our terrain .\nWe overuse medicines , many of which suppress the immune system .\nSo , we need to emphasize the magnificent 30-year research about the microbiome and take care of our bodies to avoid leaky gut and other conditions that act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the pillar related to stress ?\nMost of the people I studied learned to eliminate certain stresses so they could maximize the quality of their remaining time .\nThis led to healing .\nWe have to widen our window of tolerance for stress so it doesn \u2019 t keep us in fight , flight , freeze or fawn , and to differentiate between \u201c challenge stress \u201d and \u201c toxic stress \u201d .\nRunning a marathon can be a challenge stress that helps you reach your higher self , expand your understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a repair response for muscles .\nBut if every day you \u2019 re

exist .\nDoctors are taught to find symptoms , make a diagnosis and start a medication .\nBut whether a patient comes in for back pain , a heart attack or an autoimmune flare-up , it \u2019 s critical to ask them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the story of the illness .\nUsually , that will prompt a cathartic recount of stresses that relate to what \u2019 s going on physically .\nHelping people understand the deeper story of their illness and find a path to healing around that can be life-saving .\nGabor Mate says , \u201c If you don \u2019 t know how to say no , your body will eventually say no for you.\n\u201d Our hospitals are full of people who spent their entire lives taking care of everyone else and being conflict-avoidant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells the story .\nWe can learn to listen to what our bodies are telling us about honoring the dignity and value that we bring into the world ; set up a life and boundaries that support that ; and educate therapists and the public about what trauma is and how to recover from it .\nCan you explain the fourth pillar\u2014healing identity and beliefs ?\nThis is the big one , which people said was the reason they were grateful for their illnesses .\nWhen people are diagnosed with an incurable illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ( more than you would think ) are also relieved .\nThey \u2019 ll say , \u201c If I only have six months to live , then I don

you need and want , that death of the false self allows the birth of a more authentic self that becomes its own journey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how we feel about who we are , how we experience our value in the world and what kind of universe we live in .\nIs the universe friendly and caring or unfriendly and uncaring ?\nIf we experience ourselves and others as human beings who have value and bring beauty into the world , that \u2019 s very different from feeling alone , defective or not good enough .\nHow a person feels at a deep , conscious or unconscious level about themselves and the universe is a massive factor in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can people learn from your research ?\nTake compassionate and firm charge of your minds , bodies and life .\nDoctors teach patients to be passive recipients of care , but the possibilities of healing come from within .\nIt \u2019 s not about taking a medication as much as understanding our value , assertively taking steps to create a community
