the Democrats \u2019 Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act by refusing to invoke cloture .\nMoreover , the Democrats \u2019 bid to bypass the filibuster met a similar fate as Democratic Senators Manchin and Sinema stayed true to their word and voted with every GOP senator in opposition to the raw power grab .\nThe debate dragged on for hours with each side repeating itself numerous times .\nBut the salient points can not be questioned .\nThe Founders did not create the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy of the House .\nThey clearly envisioned the Senate to act as a check to the passions of the moment and to forge legislative solutions far more stable than the pendulum swings of temporary majorities .\nAnd since the filibuster uniquely enables the Senate to fulfill what the Founders envisioned , its elimination would effectively create two houses of representatives instead of one .\nGiven the fact that numerous Democratic senators recently and very publicly affirmed support for the filibuster , the natural question to ask is why ?\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s views are different now than what was expressed 25 years ago ; it \u2019 s another altogether to pivot literally days after utilizing it to vote for its elimination .\nIt will do no good to argue that the Democrats were merely wanting to return the filibuster to an actual debate and that they \u2019 d only do it just this once .\nThey knew good and well that once that boundary was crossed , there would be no turning back .\nMoreover , they also knew ( because several of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sword they created as soon as the GOP regained control of the Senate .\nThey would be powerless to stop Republicans from steamrolling their agenda when a GOP president occupied the White House .\nIndeed , President Trump had urged the Senate to kill the filibuster some 34 times ( which the Senate wisely ignored ) .\nIt seems rather obvious that the Democrats \u2019 obsession to establish a permanent majority caused them to craft partisan legislation designed to federalize local elections and create an environment where fraud is harder if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocacy of voters \u2019 rights was laid bare by their opposition to voter ID and other curbs to voter fraud .\nThe speed with which they rushed this through to a vote , in comparison with many other items of legislation having bipartisan support , demonstrates beyond ambiguity that the Democrats did not want to even give lip service to bipartisanship .\nThat seems to be the nature of things nowadays in Washington , but if that \u2019 s how they \u2019 re going to operate , they have no basis to complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board\u2014especially when you call them racists just because they disagree with you .\nOn that score , in what lunatic universe do you think you \u2019 ll convince members of your own party to vote with you when you compare their opposition ( Manchin \u2019 s & Sinema \u2019 s ) to siding with the likes of Jefferson Davis and Jim Crow ?\nOf course , playing the race card is part and parcel of the Democratic playbook , but it \u2019 s been played so often and so irrelevantly that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning .\nIt is well-nigh impossible to gin up racial animus when the election laws of Democratic strongholds are far more restrictive than the ones they chose to criticize .\nWe may , however , have to look at another angle .\nAs stated above , the Senate \u2019 s action today comes as no surprise , so Schumer knew good and well that he \u2019 d go down in flames .\nNonetheless , President Biden may have given away the store during his laughable press conference when he refused to affirm that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other words , if his legislation is defeated , we can not trust the results of the midterms if the GOP takes back the House and the Senate .\nThus , by forcing a public vote with a lot of press coverage , Schumer and the Democrats were positioning themselves to blame voter suppression if the midterms are disastrous .\nAs they incessantly blamed Russian collusion to delegitimize Trump \u2019 s 2016 election , so they will allege GOP shenanigans to delegitimize any GOP victory .\nThe translation : Elections are only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s a \u201c big lie \u201d only if conservatives cry foul .\nThe Democrats can cry foul as the day is long , and that \u2019 s never a big lie , right ?\nAnd we \u2019 re somehow supposed to believe that we \u2019 ve never had a democratic republic before the Freedom to Vote Act ?\nYes , there is a big lie , and it \u2019 s coming from the Left .\nThere is one thing , however , that all sides seem to agree on .\nIf the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it will not believe that it has given its consent to be governed .\nThat will have a catastrophic effect on our country .\nWhen one side advocates voting rights for illegal aliens and opposes measures to ensure that every vote is legal , it can not avoid the implication that it is trying to cheat .\nAnd that \u2019 s the bottom line , isn \u2019 t it ?\nA raw power grab is what they \u2019 re after , and they \u2019 ll stop at nothing to obtain it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare in the Democratic Party .\nBut if our Republic is to survive , we can not pretend that autocrats in sheep \u2019 s clothing are acting in good faith .\nTo pretend otherwise is to cut

Wade Overturned?", "content": "A political earthquake hit the United States as word spread that a draft of the majority opinion in Mississippi v. Jackson Women \u2019 s Health Organization was leaked to Politico this evening .\nThe majority opinion is alleged to have been written by Justice Samuel Alito .\nIt contains the following remarks : It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people \u2019 s elected representatives\u2026This is what the Constitution and the rule of law demand\u2026Abortion presents a profound moral question .\nThe Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casey arrogated that authority .\nWe now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives .\nAccording to Alan Dershowitz , who was interviewed by Sean Hannity , a leak of this sort is unprecedented in the Court \u2019 s history .\nHe theorizes that a liberal staffer may have leaked the draft in order to either put pressure on the Court to change its decision or to induce Congress to either pack the Court or to introduce national legislation to preserve abortion \u201c rights \u201d throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be a hoax in hope of producing enough outrage to intimidate any wavering justice to change course and reaffirm Roe .\nSince passions run extremely high on both sides of the debate , a staffer may have found the temptation to take matters into his or her own hands too great to resist .\nNo doubt , if the source of the leak is discovered , said person will be immediately and permanently dismissed from ever working for the Court and disbarred .\nGiven the monumental nature of such a ruling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical short-sightedness , probably thinks that the circumstances warrant the risk .\nThis is another reason in a long list why the Court should not be politicized .\nIf the Court does indeed overturn Roe , the matter of abortion will return to the People where it always belonged .\nThe Court brazenly took upon itself the mantle of being the arbiter of an issue it had no business getting involved in .\nIt invented a right out of whole cloth and deprived the People of their rightful position to settle the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and voting .\nBeing for or against abortion on a personal level bears no relevance to the legal issue of whether the Constitution recognizes it as a right .\nThough conservatives are overwhelmingly pro-life , their legal position has consistently been on the side of states \u2019 rights\u2014that states are legally entitled to settle the matter one way or the other .\nConservatives recognize that certain states will legalize abortion , and though they vehemently oppose the taking of innocent human life , they acknowledge the limits of what can be done legally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , couldn \u2019 t care less what the law is .\nFor them , ramming their views down everybody \u2019 s throats is as natural as breathing air .\nOn every issue , it \u2019 s their way or the highway .\nIf they can not get their way legislatively , they \u2019 ll try to get a judge to supplant democracy and force the People to abide by their dictates .\nAnd if the courts don \u2019 t go along , they \u2019 ll move to pack the courts to achieve their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mockery of the law and manifest their disregard for it .\nFor them , the law can only be used to subjugate their political enemies .\nJustice has no place in their mindset .\nIt is fervently hoped that this is truly the

under rational scrutiny with cross reference to the actual facts of the matter .\nCase in point , Georgia .\nRecord Early Voting in Georgia as Major Primary Race Takes Place Next Week The early voting in Georgia is breaking all state records .\nAccording to the GA secretary of state office statement yesterday , \u201c through Wednesday , May 19th , over 565,000 people have early voted in Georgia\u2014a 189 % increase from the same point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary election and a 153 % increase in the same point in the early voting period in the 2020 primary election .\nThis represents a voting scale 3x the rate of the 2018 mid-term election .\nObviously , Georgia voters are enthusiastic to vote in this primary .\nThe GA SoS reports party votes as , \u201c Republican : 353,161 [ 62 % ] , Democrat : 258,200 [ 46 % ] , Nonpartisan : 4,017 [ 0.7 % ] \u201d through May 18th .\nYes , republican voters are far outpacing democrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t be too surprising given the top of the ticket on the Democrat ballot is an uncontested primary race to install Stacey Abrams as the 2022 Democrat governor candidate .\nDespite being in an uncontested race , the team behind Stacey Abrams is working hard to drive out their voter base .\nAs the Washington Post noted , Abram \u2019 s group \u2018 The New Georgia Project \u2019 , is working diligently to help Georgia Democrats make the right ballot selections .\nAdditionally , another allied group called \u2018 Black Voters Matter \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure black voters get the primary outcome that matters most to them .\nIndeed , here in Valdosta ( Lowndes County , South Georgia ) early voting has been brisk and campaign signs for the various Republican primary candidates abound .\nMeanwhile the only signs from \u2018 Black Voters Matter \u2019 are found at the relatively urban small churches\u2026 Against all of this extra emphasis on early voting success in Georgia there is a weird dynamic on the Republican side of the equation .\nAccording to most general reporting from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm on the GOP ballot to keep Brian Kemp as governor ; however , oddly enough , it seems like Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is being positioned for defeat .\nAt least that \u2019 s the perspective of Politico and other similarly minded media .\nThen again those media outlets are strangely silent on the results of the Georgia State Republican Convention where Brian Kemp narrowly avoided a vote of Censure , and where Raffensperger was Censured .\nThe MSM political perspective is that republican Brian Kemp will easily win the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will lose a primary challenge to republican Jody Hice , a Trump endorsement .\nIt would certainly be unusual for a Trump endorsed top of ticket candidate David Perdue to lose , and the Trump endorsed office on the next line to win \u2013 but that \u2019 s the general narrative and they are sticking to it .\nThe Trump-endorsed David Perdue camp is hoping to keep establishment Governor Brian Kemp under 50 % and force a run-off special election .\nHowever , the Trump-endorsed Jody Hice camp is looking for an outright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFunny that .\nThe Republican grass roots are not best pleased with Kemp , and show utter contempt for Raffensperger .\nI expect Belle Isle to emerge as the nominee for Secretary of State and for the nomination for Governor to go to a run off .", "author": "Rodney Graves", "url": "https://www.wizbangblog.com/2022/05/22/early-voting-in-georgia-primary-sets-new-turnout-records/", "published": "Sun, 22 May 2022

shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde , TX and the recent grocery store shooting in Buffalo , NY , have been the pretexts for predictable calls to ban firearms .\nThe Left has convinced itself and is attempting to convince anybody who will listen that firearms are the reason these tragedies occur .\nIf we get rid of the guns , say they , we will get rid of the problem .\nAfter all , the United States is the only place in the world where these things happen , right ?\nAnd while they screech about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NRA ) culpability and holding gun manufacturers legally liable for violent acts committed with their products , their allies are openly calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment to the Constitution .\nAt the very least , we need another ban on \u201c assault rifles \u201d to make us feel better about doing something in wake of these mass murders .\nThe word pretext means \u201c a purpose or motive alleged or an appearance assumed in order to cloak the real intention or state of affairs.\n\u201d Leftists , given their totalitarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is therefore their natural inclination to impose speech codes , establish disinformation boards , and outright ban , whenever possible , speech or expression that strays from their agenda .\nThis is why they are obsessed with controlling government .\nIf they control the government , they will have the weaponry needed to enforce their decrees .\nThey realize that an armed populace , especially one in which millions of citizens have millions of firearms , has the means to resist and defend its rights .\nAnd since allowing dissent is out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disarmed in order to make it easier for them to force compliance to their decrees .\nA firearms ban has always been an essential component of the Left \u2019 s agenda , regardless the level of crime or the instances of mass shootings .\nBut given the strong public support for the Second Amendment , the Left \u2019 s objective is impotent without the occurrence of tragedies like Uvalde to exploit for maximum effect .\nThey can not on their own gin up the needed outrage to ban firearms without images of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThus , Leftists see dead children as the perfect opportunity to resuscitate their power grab .\nCase in point , if Democrats were really serious about protecting children , then why aren \u2019 t they doing something NOW to defend them ?\nHow will mental health red flag enhancements and raising the minimum age of firearms purchases supposed to stop the next shooting ?\nHow will an \u201c assault rifle \u201d ban

handguns to murder 32 people ?\nHave they forgotten about the 19 people who were killed in a knife attack in Japan ?\nDid they forget that it takes two-thirds of each chamber of Congress and three-fourths of the States to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously take a very long time ) ?\nIf their tears are real and if their screaming is heartfelt ; if they are really fed-up and if their \u201c enough already \u201d is spoken with pure motives , then conceding everything on their agenda , what are they going to do between now and when all their political goals are realized ?\nWhat proposals have they offered that will protect our children RIGHT NOW ?\n?\nBack in 2013 , Senators Cruz and Grassley introduced a proposal for $ 300 million in federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as bulletproof doors and windows as well as armed guards .\nThe filibuster hating Democrats used that very method to defeat the proposal .\nMore guns are not the answer , they argued .\nBut these same Democrats get their panties tied in a wad over the slow police response in Uvalde .\nWhy is it okay for \u201c more guns \u201d to show up after the shooting has started instead of before ?\nWhy wait until children are dead before sending \u201c more guns \u201d to the scene ?\n\u201c We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools into armed fortresses , \u201d they complain .\nSo , the solution is to leave them defenseless which is an invitation for more shootings ?\n?\nLeftists would rather have more shootings than to protect our children now ?\n?\nDeflecting those inconvenient facts , they pointed to \u201c poison pills \u201d in the proposal that they objected to , but that \u2019 s a red herring .\nThey could have offered the same security enhancements without the objectionable \u201c pills , \u201d but since having guns for self-defense is unacceptable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banning guns ) , they have to find other reasons to oppose commonsense legislation while their cronies in the media run cover for them .\nIf keeping our children safe is really not a Republican/Democrat issue , then let \u2019 s face reality .\nThe reality is that America has always had guns , but it hasn \u2019 t always had school shootings .\nThe reality is that there are evil persons who are looking for soft ( defenseless ) targets , so the only reasonable solution is to have well-trained personnel on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked doors , bulletproof windows and doors , single points of entry , metal detectors , and well-trained armed guards will go a long way toward ensuring a safe environment for students and staff across the country .\nThe real outrage here is that you will not get cooperation from the Democrats .\nIf they protect soft targets , they won \u2019 t get the headlines they need to ban guns .\nSo , keeping the most vulnerable
