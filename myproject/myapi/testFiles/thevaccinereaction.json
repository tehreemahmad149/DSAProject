healthcare workers who work in a facility that receives funding from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) .1 The worker COVID vaccine mandate requires businesses with 100 or more

basis when appeals were made by both sides in the matter after a series of court decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the federal COVID vaccine mandates are enforceable .\nThe most recent decision by the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals lifted the temporary stay on the workplace mandate , which was granted in November 2021 and affected 80 million workers .\nThe Justice Department and challengers to the COVID vaccine mandates reached out to Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito seeking their assistance in reversing Appellate Court orders that both stayed and reinstated the workplace

Mandate ?\nAt issue with the workplace mandates is whether OSHA has the legal authority to enforce the sweeping federal vaccine mandate through its emergency temporary standards .\nOf the nine

is that the majority of emergency temporary standards have been struck down by the courts.\n\u201d 13 Opponents stress that such sweeping mandates should be enacted by Congress rather than OSHA , pointing out that the risks from exposure to COVID-19 are not limited to the workplace and that COVID is a universal threat in society with the potential for transmission anywhere from one \u2019 s

consolidated , and a lottery was used to determine which court would ultimately decide the issue.16 17 The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals , which was chosen to hear the consolidated cases , reinstated the workplace vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end to the temporary stay issued by the Fifth Circuit Court.18 The majority opinion found : The Fate of 10.3 million Health Care Workers Will Also Be Decided by SCOTUS The Supreme Court of the United States will also hear arguments as to whether CMS can mandate COVID vaccine for all health care workers in a health care facility that receives funding from CMS .\nThe U.S. District Court in Missouri struck down the vaccine mandate in 10 states , concluding that CMS lacked the constitutional authority to mandate a vaccine for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million of which are unvaccinated.20 The COVID vaccine mandate for healthcare workers remains in effect in approximately half of the states.21 The Biden administration will not enforce the mandate until the legal challenges are concluded.22 The health care workers mandate is the first time that the federal government has attempted to mandate a vaccine for a significant portion of the U.S. population .\nPublic health laws mandating vaccine use have historically been reserved for the states and , in 1905 , the Supreme Court affirmed in Jacobson v Massachusetts that state legislatures had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mandate ) smallpox vaccine.23 Vaccines laws in the U.S. are primarily state laws and vary from state to state.24 In 2021 , no state passed a law mandating universal COVID-19 vaccine use and a number of states , like Florida and Texas , passed legislation prohibiting COVID vaccine mandates.25 One of CMS \u2019 s stated justifications for the federal vaccine mandate is to enforce a uniform rule across the country , while opponents fear forcing use of the controversial COVID vaccine will result in a large exodus of health care workers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most .\nThe current state of the COVID vaccine mandate is disjointed and allows health care workers in half the country to continue to work without being forced to get vaccinated , while the other half faces termination if they do not

Attorney Aaron Siri managing partner at Siri & Glimstad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of COVID vaccine mandates in court , said , \u201c The grounds on which the emergency rule is likely to be struck down is that CMS doesn \u2019 t have the statutory authority to adopt this regulation.\n\u201d 29 Among the issues is whether CMS required congressional authority to enact this sweeping federal vaccine mandate , their

U.S. District Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy Seals and ruled against the Biden administration \u2019 s COVID vaccine mandate .\nHe issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Navy from punishing the Navy Seals who had filed religious exemption .\nThe injunction barred the Navy from declaring the unvaccinated Navy Seals non-deployable or disqualified from Special Operations.7 The Court pointed out that not only did the Navy fail to grant a single exemption for COVID vaccines , but it has not approved any religious exemption for any vaccine at all over the past seven years.8 The judge stated that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navy said the Seals would be considered , \u201c medically disqualified \u201d and would be forever prevented from deployment and from receiving bonuses and incentive pay \u2013 even though Navy personnel with medical vaccine exemptions do not face the same severe consequences .\nSome Navy Seals were informed that they would lose their Seal Tridents if they were granted a religious exemption to vaccination or even if they just applied for one.9 The Court came to the same conclusion on both the RFRA and the First Amendment claims .\nBecause the Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the court applied strict scrutiny analysis and found that the Navy did not have , \u201c a compelling interest justifying the substantial burden on Plaintiff \u2019 s religious beliefs.\n\u201d 10 Once a substantial burden to their religious beliefs was established by Plaintiffs , the Defendants must then show that the burden furthers a compelling interest and that they are using the least restrictive means to further that interest .\nThe Judge explained that it is not enough for the Defendants to show their policy furthers a broad compelling interest such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must show a compelling interest in vaccinating the 35 individual Plaintiffs in this matter .\nWith a 99.4 percent vaccination rate , the Court concluded that the Defendants do not have a compelling interest in vaccinating the Plaintiffs in this case .\nThe Court further stressed that the fact that unvaccinated Navy personnel with medical exemptions are still eligible for deployment belies the compelling nature of the vaccinations policy .\nSince the Plaintiff \u2019 s policy was deemed not to be compelling , the Court did not need to address whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an injunction.11 The Court concluded that the Plaintiffs suffered irreparable harm from the vaccine mandate .\nPlaintiffs have suffered the more serious injury of \u201c infringement of their religious liberty rights under RFRA and the First Amendment .\n.\n.\n.\n\u201d Pls.\n\u2019 Br .\n28 , ECF No .\n16 .\nThe crisis of conscience imposed by the mandate is itself an irreparable harm .\nSee BST Holdings , 17 F.4th at 618 ;

373 ( plurality opinion ) .12 ( emphasis added ) \u201c There is no COVID-19 exception to the First Amendment .\nThere is no military exclusion from our Constitution.\n\u201d Finally , the Court found that that balance of hardships favors the Plaintiffs because their loss of liberty outweighs the Defendant \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seals and that it was not against the public interest to issue a preliminary injunction .\nAs of Dec. 29 , 2021 , over a month after the vaccine mandate deadline passed , more than 8,000 Navy service members , 5,328 active duty and 3,002 Ready Reserve , have not

government agencies , universities , or professional medical organizations to help individuals recover from the SARS-CoV-2 infection that causes COVID-19 without the need for hospitalization .\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , which recommends monoclonal antibodies for high-risk individuals and fever reducing medication , hydration and rest for those who are not hospitalized , refers both patients and health care providers to federal treatment guidelines.1 The U.S. National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) provides a comprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c moderate \u201d recommendation for monoclonal antibodies for high-risk individuals , and recommends fluids , rest , and over-the-counter medications for fever , headache , muscle pain and cough for those who are not hospitalized.2 Both the CDC and NIH discourage the use of any other licensed drugs or neutraceuticals in post-exposure prevention or pre-exposure prophylaxis for SARS-CoV-2 infections except for individuals participating in clinical trials .\nThe home treatment guide for COVID from the prestigious Mayo Clinic focuses on preventing spread and recognizing emergency warning signs requiring intervention or hospitalization .\nHowever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidance offers little in the way of supportive therapies that might prevent worsening of disease symptoms.3 Although the recovery rate for SARS-COV-2 infections is between 97 and 99.5 percent,4 and most people recover without hospitalization , there are currently 125,922 people hospitalized with COVID in the U.S. , and numbers are on an upward trend.5 Recent estimates of costs associated with inpatient treatment for COVID average from $ 31,339 to $ 472,213 per person , depending upon the severity of the case.6 Federal data shows the emergency department visits with diagnosed COVID cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pandemic\u2014a figure that has more than doubled over the last month .\n\u201c Admissions with COVID is still very disruptive to the health care system , at a time when it can \u2019 t afford more disruption , \u201d stressed Ashish Jha , MD , Dean of the Brown University School of Public Health in a recent tweet.7 In

antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that were designed to mimic the immune system \u2019 s natural response to harmful pathogens such as viruses , and are administered to patients via IV infusions ( on an outpatient or in-hospital basis ) .\nDrug companies were given Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) in November 2020 to distribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of COVID.9 Some studies have shown that monoclonal antibodies can dramatically reduce the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID .\nHowever , many patients who qualify for the treatment say their doctors never mentioned it to them , even though it has been nearly a year since antibodies were first authorized and they remain the only federally approved early treatment for early COVID.10 At a White House briefing in August 2021 , Anthony Fauci , MD , director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease ( NIAID ) urged doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said that they can reduce the risk of COVID hospitalization or death by 70 to 85 percent .\n\u201c This is a very effective intervention for COVID-19 .\nIt is underutilized , and we recommend strongly that we utilize this to its fullest , \u201d Dr. Fauci said .\n\u201c We want people out there , including physicians , as well as potential patients , to realize the advantage of this very effective way of treating early infection.\n\u201d When asked by CNN why more doctors and health centers aren \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Fauci said , \u201c I can \u2019 t explain that.\n\u201d 11 The federal government purchased $ 2.9 billion worth of the monoclonal antibodies to ease supply issues in September 202112 but problems have persisted .\n\u201c It \u2019 s unconscionable , \u201d said Peter Chin-Hong , MD , an infectious disease expert and professor at the University of California-San Francisco School of Medicine .\n\u201c We have an evidence-based drug , and it \u2019 s provided free by the government , but there are barriers built into the system to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors have successfully treated COVID with monoclonal antibodies , there have been reported infusion-related reactions to activation of the immune system by the monoclonal antibodies , such as flushing , itching , shortness of breath and low blood pressure,14 and there is a possibility of immediate or delayed serious adverse events , including cytokine release syndrome , acute anaphylaxis , serum sickness , infections , cancer , autoimmune disease and cardiotoxicity.15 16 There is uncertainty about whether the currently available monoclonal antibodies are effective in treating the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2.17 In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID from the U.S. government health agencies , the nation \u2019 s leading medical centers , or professional medical organizations , a number of highly credentialed and widely published critical care physicians and front line doctors working in hospitals and outpatient clinics have organized to collect and share their experience and research to develop lifesaving protocols for the prevention and treatment of COVID in all stages of illness .\nThe most widely known home-based treatment protocols have been published by Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care ( FLCCC ) Alliance , Truth for Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council for Health ( WCH ) .\nThe COVID treatment protocols include repurposed FDA-licensed pharmaceuticals , neutraceuticals , and over-the-counter ( OTC ) medications .\nAlthough each protocol varies somewhat , they all contain combinations that serve to act as anti-viral ( nasal rinses/mouthwash gargle , ivermectin , hydroxychloroquine , antibiotics , nebulized colloidal silver , nitazoxamide ) , anti-inflammatory ( ibuprofen , aspirin , NAC , antihistamines , corticosteroids , budesonide inhaler , loratadine , fomatidine , colchicine , naproxen , promethazine ) , anti-coagulant ( aspirin , prescription blood thinners ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C ,

not generated reports of serious adverse medical events.22 In October 2020 , the FLCCC Alliance developed a prophylaxis and early treatment protocol centered around the drug ivermectin .\nThis became the I-MASK+ Prophylaxis and At-home Treatment Protocol for COVID.23 24 In addition to ivermectin ( or , alternately , nigella sativa ) , the I-MASK+ protocol includes a daily gargle of antiseptic mouthwash that contains either cetylpyridinium chloride , chlorhexidine , 1 percent povidone iodine , or Listerine with essential oils and povidone-iodine nasal spray/drops to reduce viral replication in the nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamin D3 , vitamin C , quercetin , elemental zinc , turmeric , and melatonin , with aspirin as an anti-coagulant .\nThe doctors have recommended monitoring oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter .\nThey have also used second line agents ( spironolactone , dutasteride , fluvoxamine , and monoclonal antibodies ) and include prednisone or methylprednisone as third line agents .\nThe FLCCC Alliance has also developed a protocol for treating Long Haul COVID-19 Syndrome ( LHCS ) and post vaccine inflammatory syndromes called I-RECOVER.25 The I-RECOVER basic protocol centers around ivermectin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , atorvastatin , melatonin and vitamin D3 .\nCorticosteroid therapy or fluvoxamine ( for neurological symptoms ) are also part of the protocol if symptoms are more prolonged and , if Long Haul COVID symptoms remain unresolved , they have included a pulmonary evaluation and treatment of suspected mast cell activation .\nThe FLCCC Alliance website contains COVID-19 treatment protocols available in twelve languages with supporting clinical evidence for safety and effectiveness .\nThe Truth for Health Home-Based COVID Treatment protocol26 27 is based on the understanding that different medicines are needed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viral replication days 1-5 ; exaggerated inflammation response days 5-10 ; and exaggerated formation of blood clots up to 30 days .\nUsing a decision tree based on a combination of age and the number of comorbid conditions , as well as progression of illness , treatment is focused on stopping viral replication and containing illness to the first stage .\nThe protocol begins with a neutraceutical bundle of zinc , vitamin D3 , vitamin C and quercetin .\nFurther intervention may include monoclonal antibodies and a combination of either hydroxycloroquine , ivermectin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a pulse oximeter is recommended , with supplemental oxygen as needed .\nTFH also has a protocol for hospital treatment , Long Haul COVID-19 Syndrome , and vaccine injury .\nThe TFH medical team and executive team includes Elizabeth Lee Vliet , MD ; Peter McCullough , MD , PhD ; Michael Yeadon , PhD ; Paul

controlled trials\u2013ACTIV-6 at Duke University , COVID-OUT at the University of Minnesota,31 and PRINCIPLE at Oxford University,32 are currently underway to evaluate ivermectin as a treatment for COVID .\nA meta-analysis published in August 202133 concluded that there was moderate-certainty evidence for large reductions in COVID deaths using ivermectin .\nThe study authors concluded that using ivermectin early in the clinical course of COVID disease may reduce the numbers of cases progressing to severe disease , and that the apparent safety and low cost suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a significant positive impact on reducing morbidity and mortality in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic globally .\nA June 2020 systematic review published in the medical journal Antibiotics34 identified

and low cost drug as one of the first-line treatment options for COVID.35 Metabolic Syndrome Ignored As Risk Factor In COVID-19 Response Researchers at Tulane University School of Medicine36 demonstrated that metabolic syndrome ( obesity , type 2 diabetes , and/or hypertension ) is associated with an increased risk for intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission , invasive mechanical ventilation , acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , mortality , and with prolonged hospital and ICU length of stay .\n\u201c Given the high rates of metabolic syndrome , obesity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hypothesis for why the United States led the world in COVID cases and deaths could be the high prevalence of metabolic syndrome in this population , \u201d the authors write.37 A study published in the November 202138 reported that up to 50 percent of people who have died of COVID had metabolic and vascular disorders , and that body mass index is strongly correlated with immune markers that predict severe COVID .\nThe authors concluded , \u201c It would be a progressive failure not to respond to this alarm signal and change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obesity with societal measures , diagnose metabolic syndromes as early as possible , focus on diabetes remission rather than progressive and expensive treatment , and individualize diabetes management to meet sustainable prevention of complications by use of all available evidence and technology.\n\u201d They went on , \u201c The non-communicable pandemic of metabolic disease due to diabetes and obesity , affecting 0\u00b75 billion people worldwide , could be considered as the foundation for the communicable COVID pandemic , which has disproportionately affected this patient group.\n\u201d A study at the Cleveland Clinic39 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had previously had bariatric ( weight loss ) surgery with those who had not , and found that the rate of infection was similar between the groups , but patients who had weight-loss surgery had a 49 percent lower risk of hospitalization , a 63 percent lower risk of the need for supplemental oxygen and a 60 percent lower risk of developing severe COVID .\n\u201c This study suggests that an emphasis on weight loss as a public health strategy can improve outcomes during the COVID pandemic and future outbreaks or related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MD , chief academic officer of the Heart , Vascular and Thoracic Institute at Cleveland Clinic .\n\u201c That is a very important finding , considering that 40 percent of Americans have obesity.\n\u201d Despite the contribution of obesity and metabolic disorders to the disease burden of COVID , weight loss and prevention of metabolic disorders are not currently part of any published COVID public health policy .\nVaccination Under Emergency Use Authorization Not Allowed If Adequate Treatments Are Available During a public health emergency , the FDA can use its authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distribute unapproved medical products in the U.S.

Will Not Save Us", "content": "I have heard many people say that at this moment\u2014January 2022\u2014testing will save us .\nThey cite success stories like the National Basketball Association \u2019 s bubble ( of 2020 ) to show what testing can accomplish .\nUnfortunately , here are nine considerations that they are missing when it comes to mass testing .\n1 .\nNo one has any tests .\nThere are widespread shortages of home testing kits .\nJust a few weeks ago in hot spots like New York City , lines for testing could be up to four hours .\nEmergency departments in some cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flights , vacation or travel .\nThe Biden administration announced it would send tests to households , but these will likely be few in number and precise date of arrival is unknown .\n2 .\nMany tests have limited sensitivity .\nMost testing is home based , as such it is limited by the operator and test characteristics achieved at home .\nThis has been described at length here , but the short answer is sensitivity can be poor .\nLow sensitivity means that a few people who are truly infectious may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false comfort , and alter their behavior in a way that drives spread .\nRepeating testing can improve sensitivity , but behavior may change between tests ( i.e .\nafter only one negative ) , most people may not wait for several repeated negative tests to alter behavior .\nConsider the example shared by former editor-in-chief of Science Jeremy Berg .\nHe held a family gathering after testing all participants , only to have it result in a superspreader event .\nLikely a false negative led to this outcome .\n3 .\nLow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection in an asymptomatic person in many counties combined with modest specificity yields false positive results .\nIf specificity is lower , as for some assays , false positives will become more frequent .\nFalse positive results mean the test says you have COVID-19 but you do not , and these can bog down health care settings with confirmatory tests , and disrupt society with isolation , repeat testing , etc .\n4 .\nThe distribution of testing .\nNow , let \u2019 s contrast the NBA with America .\nThe NBA applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bubble with consistency and fairness .\nThis is not what is happening in America .\nThe distribution of testing is highly abnormal .\nIt may resemble the global wealth distribution !\nMany people have had 0 tests , most may have had < 3 tests , while a tiny fraction may have had 100 or 200 tests .\nThe same is true for hoarding tests .\nMost American \u2019 s have no tests in their house\u2014evident by the long lines\u2014but some have tens or hundreds of tests in a cabinet .\nHighly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the shoulders of a few people .\nThese people are likely highly unusual .\nThey are likely to be richer and more anxious than average people .\nTest characteristics like positive predictive value can deteriorate by the repeated testing of the individuals least at risk of the virus .\n5 .\nTesting is only helpful if you have the resources to make salutatory choices as a result of the information .\nA sick parent with young kids who can not isolate , might not be able to act upon a test result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their test result at attend work anyway , if they worry about financial hardship from failing to attend work .\nYou could drop tests from an airplane , blanketing a city , but you may not impact the pandemic trajectory if you do not provide resources to act on them .\n6 .\nRisk reduction vs delaying infection .\nFor SARS-CoV-2 , infection is inevitable .\nInfection can be avoided for weeks or months or perhaps years , but eventually , the virus will touch all human beings who touch another person .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ between two classes of interventions .\nThere are interventions that lower your risk of bad outcomes , and those that delay the time until you touch the virus ; ( there are also those that are purely theater , but let us set that aside for now ) .\nVaccination , losing weight , and improving your medical management of chronic conditions are things that may lower your risk of bad outcomes when you meet the virus , and are worth pursuing .\nTesting is something that , at best and if used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the virus , but it will not avert it entirely .\nAs such , it may provide a health benefit if used meticulously in places on the brink of health care collapse , but the theoretical value in places with modest cases , or in highly vaccinated settings with many mild cases , is poor .\n7 .\nHarms of testing .\nStaffing shortages as vital work-place sites can have detrimental effects .\nFor instance , if hospitals become understaffed past a critical point , health care system collapse may ensue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under some conditions , it may be preferable for a hospitalized patient to have staff , even if some members are asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic test positive versus not having a staff member at all .\nThus , testing paired with prolonged quarantine can even result in worse outcomes under some circumstances .\nThis was part of the logic behind the recent CDC push to shorten

"Are Adverse Events in COVID-19 Vaccine Trials Under-Reported?", "content": "Opinion | Phase III controlled trials are considered the \u2018 gold standard \u2019 for assessing vaccine efficacy and safety in humans .\nThese are the trials upon which authorities have assured the public that COVID-19 vaccines are \u201c safe and effective.\n\u201d The benefits of the vaccines in reducing disease severity and hospitalizations are well-known , but what do we know about the adverse events ?\nData on adverse events is vital for effective decision-making by regulators , policy makers , doctors , and patients .\nBut there are serious concerns about publication bias or selective omission of data , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be published than positive results .\nA systematic review in PLOS journal analyzed 28 studies and found that adverse events were less likely to appear in published journal articles than unpublished studies ( e.g .\nindustry-held data ) .\nExperts now suggest that the pivotal COVID-19 vaccine trials may have under-reported adverse events in several ways .\nIn the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccine trials , participants were given digital apps to record adverse events remotely\u2014a more convenient , time efficient and cost-effective way of gathering patient data .\nA major problem however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital apps have a narrow focus on particular adverse events .\nFor example , the app only allows a participant to record what the company deems as \u2018 expected \u2019 events such as fever , pain at injection site , temperature , redness , swelling , fatigue , headache , diarrhea , chills , muscle and joint pain .\nBut if they experience a serious adverse event like myocarditis or early signs of transverse myelitis , Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome , a myopathic disorder , myocarditis or thrombosis , there is no option for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Case in point : Brianne Dressen , a participant in the AstraZeneca ( AZD1222 ) trial .\nShe suffered a severe adverse event after her first injection and became disabled .\nBut her smartphone app did not allow her to record the particular type of adverse event , nor did it allow her to record her symptoms in her own words .\nOnce hospitalized , Ms. Dressen was \u2018 unblinded \u2019 from the trial .\nShe was informed that she had been given the AstraZeneca vaccine , not the placebo , and advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The investigators subsequently \u201c withdrew \u201d Ms. Dressen from the trial , they disabled her smartphone app , and all her data from that day onwards , were never documented despite still experiencing disability today .\nMs. Dressen was concerned about the lack of reporting of her adverse event ( and others ) in the trial \u2019 s publication in the top-tiered New England Journal of Medicine .\nShe wrote to the journal seeking to \u201c request inaccuracies in the trial publication be corrected , and to demand complete reporting of the trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rubin refused to correct the inaccurate data in his journal .\nThe full email exchange has been made public .\nIf vaccine manufacturers selectively withdraw subjects who experience serious adverse events ( as in the case of Brianne Dressen and others ) it may explain why the trials mostly found \u201c statistically significant \u201d increases in minor adverse events ( fever , chills , headaches ) but not in serious harms .\nWhen Pfizer recruited 12-15 year olds for its mRNA vaccine trial , the published data in the New England Journal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no serious vaccine-related adverse events.\n\u201d One of the participants in the trial was 13-year-old Maddie De Garay .\nShe was randomly assigned to the vaccine group and following her first injection , Ms. De Garay suffered a severe adverse reaction , leaving her in a wheelchair and fed by a nasogastric tube .\nShe was referred to hospital for a full assessment and a doctor diagnosed Ms. De Garay with a \u201c functional disorder.\n\u201d Put simply , this doctor decided that a pre-disposition to \u201c hysteria , \u201d was to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this basis , she was referred to a mental health facility .\nDr. David Healy , a psychiatrist based in Ontario , Canada , subsequently conducted a thorough review of Ms. De Garay \u2019 s medical records , including an interview with her family and found no such history of pre-existing conditions or mental illness .\n\u201c This trial designation is not just wrong , but quite unbelievable , \u201d said Dr. Healy , who feared that the erroneous diagnosis would jeopardize Ms. De Garay \u2019 s treatment and progress .\n\u201c It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in order to maintain Pfizer \u2019 s position , this young woman is not getting the treatment that would be ordinarily indicated for the kind of problems she has .\nInstead based on a claimed \u2018 functional disorder \u2019 , she has been directed to a mental health facility , \u201d said Dr. Healy .\n\u201c If there is any chance that you have a pre-existing condition , then they do not blame the vaccine , \u201d he says .\n\u201c And so they can claim there were no serious vaccine-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction was \u2018 vaccine-related \u2019 .\nIt is quite unbelievable.\n\u201d Dr. Healy says he has seen it before\u2014in Study 329\u2014which looked at antidepressants ( SSRIs ) in children and adolescents .\nA 15-year-old boy was dropped from the trial after being diagnosed with an \u201c intercurrent illness \u201d .\nIt was only by chance , that later , Dr. Healy found out that the trial participant developed homicidal behaviors two weeks after taking the SSRI , which Dr. Healy says was almost certainly induced by the drug .\nBut because the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness \u201d in the trial , it meant that the investigators did not have to write up a narrative explaining why this patient was dropped from the trial .\nIn AstraZeneca \u2019 s Phase III trial of its vaccine , the one in which Brianne Dressen was a participant , the study stated : Deaths that were adjudicated as not related to COVID-19 were treated as intercurrent events and therefore censored at the date of death .\nDr. Healy said , \u201c This may well be a sink-hole into which deaths from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heart attacks or thrombotic events may have all vanished here , the justification being that they must have had a dodgy heart or another pre-existing [ or intercurrent ] illness.\n\u201d When publishing deaths in the trials , Dr. Healy points out that investigators do not link the vaccine with any deaths that occur immediately after the first dose of the vaccine , up to 14 days after the second dose of the vaccine .\nIn other words : 1 ) first injection , 2 ) wait for three weeks before having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further two weeks .\nThat is a total of where deaths are not considered to be vaccine related .\nThe investigators say it is because participants are not \u201c fully immune \u201d until two weeks after their second dose .\nThat is true .\nHowever , it fails to capture any deaths that might be caused by the vaccine in that five-week period .\nDr. Healy was very critical of this method of data collection .\n\u201c Randomized controlled trials are not supposed to allow decisions like this .\nAll deaths should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do not think the deaths were caused by the vaccine , but we need a chance to know how many there were and decide if these need further investigation , \u201d said Dr Healy .\nIt is important to know because real world data obtained from the CDC ( as of June 25 , 2021 ) shows that the majority of reported deaths after a COVID-19 vaccine , occur within 30 days .\nThis surveillance data can not establish a causal link with the vaccine , but the signal is considered significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine are not being captured in the controlled trials .\nData about the safety of vaccines are just as important as the efficacy , although , the media and public health officials often focus on the latter .\nSo far , reports of serious , life-threatening adverse events linked to the vaccines have not been found in the \u201c gold standard \u201d controlled trials .\nThey were only detected once hundreds of thousands of people had been vaccinated .\nMyocarditis , for example , only emerged from Israel once they started rolling out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And reports of vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia ( VITT ) linked with the AstraZeneca vaccine first emerged from European surveillance systems , not controlled trials .\nIf all COVID-19 vaccine trials are funded , designed , conducted , and analyzed by the manufacturers\u2014which is known to distort the results to favor the sponsor \u2019 s aims\u2014then more should be done to gain access to the data to allow for independent scrutiny .\nThis article was reprinted with the author \u2019 s permission .\nIt was originally published at MaryanneDemasi.com

Court Judge to allow the agency 75 years to release all the data upon which it licensed Pfizer \u2019 s COVID-19 vaccine ( Comirnaty ) .\nEarlier this month the FDA \u2019 s request was rejected .\nThe drug regulator had originally stated that it could only produce 500 pages per month , taking the end date for release of all the documents to 2096 .\nInstead , the Judge ruled in favor of the plaintiff and ordered the FDA to expedite the release of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages per month , taking approximately eight months .\nAaron Siri , U.S. attorney acting on behalf of the plaintiff that filed the lawsuit in September 2021 , said it was a great win for transparency .\n\u201c This removes one of the strangleholds federal health authorities have had on the data needed for independent scientists to offer solutions and address serious issues with the current vaccine program.\n\u201d The serious issues cited by Mr. Siri included waning immunity of the vaccine , variants that evade vaccine immunity , and the CDC \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent transmission .\nMr. Siri said it was particularly egregious that mandates have \u201c coerced \u201d people into taking an unwanted medical procedure as that violates basic liberties .\n\u201c The government also sought to delay full release of the data it relied upon to license this product until almost every American alive today is dead .\nThat form of governance is destructive to liberty and antithetical to the openness required in a democratic society , \u201d said Mr. Siri .\nThe Judge \u2019 s Order began by relaying the sentiments of former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market , is a nation that is afraid of its people.\n\u201d ( President John F. Kennedy ) Further , \u201c excessive administrative secrecy\u2026 feeds conspiracy theories and reduces the public \u2019 s confidence in the government , \u201d ( Senator John McCain ) The Judge noted that the purpose of a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) was to \u201c pierce the veil of administrative secrecy and to open agency action to the light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c unduly burdensome \u201d nature of the FOIA placed upon the FDA but wrote that there was unlikely to be \u201c a more important issue \u201d for the regulator than the pandemic and assuring the public that the vaccine was not rushed .\nThe Order also noted that \u201c information is often useful only if it is timely \u201d and therefore the Judge insisted that the expeditious completion of the plaintiff \u2019 s request was not only practicable , but necessary .\nTherefore , the Court would impose its \u201c equitable powers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a court-imposed timeline.\n\u201d Accordingly , the Court concluded that the FOIA request was of paramount public importance and requested that the FDA produce a redacted version of the data , ensuring that it redacted \u201c only those portions as to which privilege , exemption , or exclusion is asserted.\n\u201d \u201c Transparency is a core ethical principle of good public health , and data on which public health decisions are made need to be publicly available for independent analysis and critical scrutiny , \u201d said Dr. Aaron Kheriaty , a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case clearly made the right decision .\nWe will soon be able to see the data they were trying to keep from public scrutiny , \u201c he added .\nEpidemiology expert Prof. Tom Jefferson , agreed .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s a huge step towards opening up the FDA .\nThis is not just about the transparency of the Pfizer data , but other vaccines , that eventually , will become fully licensed , \u201d said Prof. Jefferson who is also a member of the plaintiff .\n\u201c But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and supervised PhD students , who can index and curate the information so that a thorough analysis can be carried out by experts who understand regulatory data , \u201d said Prof. Jefferson .\n\u201c I am concerned that the random release of documents might result in people data-mining to look for a smoking gun and take information out of context , \u201d he added .\nAs the Pfizer documents are released , the FDA will have redacted information that it decides is not for public consumption .\nProf. Jefferson says the FDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point where it becomes meaningless , so the devil will be in the detail .\n\u201c If the FDA redacts important information like batch numbers , then it will be difficult to identify which participants were potentially

decided two matters involving vaccine mandates by the Biden administration .\nThe oral arguments , which were heard back-to-back , addressed whether the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) had the authority to enforce a federal mandate ordering private companies and organizations with 100 or more employees to compel their employees to get a COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of employment and whether the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid ( CMS ) could mandate the vaccine for people working at a CMS-funded health care facility that accepts Medicare and Medicaid payments .\nOn Jan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision , the Court struck down the private employer mandate , finding that the order exceeded OSHA \u2019 s statutory authority .\nHowever , at the same time , the justices voted 5 to 4 to reinstate the vaccine mandate for personnel working in health care facilities that receive Medicare and Medicaid funding.1 OSHA Does Not Have the Power to Broadly Regulate Public Health A legal challenge to the OSHA COVID-19 vaccine mandate was brought to the high court by an application from the National Federation of Independent Business and a coalition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay issued by the Fifth Circuit Court was overturned by the Sixth Circuit Court.2 The question before the Court was whether OSHA had the legal authority to require a vaccine mandate for private employers .\nFinding that the Plaintiffs were likely to ultimately succeed on the merits of their claim that the Secretary of Health and Human Services , Xavier Becerra , exceeded his authority , the Supreme Court reinstated the stay .\nJustices Stephen Breyer , Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan , who were outspoken about their anxiety and fear of COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dissenting opinion that the mandate falls within OSHA \u2019 s purview of protecting workers and that forced vaccination of individuals at the expense of losing a job would save 6,500 lives and prevent 250,000 hospitalizations over six months in the U.S.4 District Courts Stop the Health Care Workers Mandate Instituted by HHS in November 2021 On Nov. 5 , 2021 , HHS Secretary Becerra announced a new interim final rule , effective immediately without allowing the regular public notice and comment period , ordering that participating facilities receiving Medicare or Medicaid funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID vaccine ( \u201c Rule \u201d ) or risk losing funding.5 Numerous lawsuits followed , and the mandate was stayed by two district courts , which determined that the rule would likely ultimately be found to violate the Constitution based on separation of powers .\nBoth district courts looked at the criteria for a preliminary injunction and determined that the facts and rule of law showed that the Plaintiffs established , \u201c ( 1 ) the substantial likelihood of success on the merits , ( 2 ) that he is likely to suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preliminary injunction , ( 3 ) that the balance of equities tips in his favor , and ( 4 ) that an injunction is in the public interest.\n\u201d 6 The Louisiana court issued a nationwide injunction finding that the CMS rule violated the separation of powers and encroached on civil liberties stating , \u201c During a pandemic such as this one , it is even more important to safeguard the separation of powers set forth in our Constitution to avoid erosion of our liberties.\n\u201d 7 The Missouri court found that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument that CMS lacks the authority to issue such a mandate because , \u201c the nature and breadth of the CMS mandate requires clear authorization from Congress\u2014and Congress has provided none \u201d and that , \u201c Even in exigency , the Secretary can not \u201c bring about an enormous and transformative expansion in [ his ] regulatory authority without clear congressional authorization.\n\u201d 8 The Supreme Court disagreed with the district courts \u2019 stay of the health care worker mandate by CMS .\nFinding that the HHS Secretary has the statutory authority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicare and Medicaid programs , the Court lifted the stay and reinstated the COVID-19 vaccine mandate .\nBecause Secretary Becerra had determined the vaccine would , \u201c substantially reduce the likelihood that health care workers will contract the virus and transmit it to their patients , \u201d the Court argued that it was within his jurisdiction to require the vaccine for all health care workers in Medicaid and Medicare funded institutions and exclude facilities from receiving federal funding should these conditions not be met.9 The Court explained ruling this way : The Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two months for the Secretary to prepare the 73-page rule , the impending winter flu season was justification to forgo the traditional public notice and comment period due to the good cause exception , and that the Secretary was not required to consult with the appropriate state agencies before implementing the rule.12 Four Supreme Court Justices Dissent from the Majority Opinion on COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate for 10 Million Health Care Workers There were two dissents in this case , one written by Justice Clarence Thomas and signed by Justices Samuel Alito , Neil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one written by Justice Alito and signed by the same three Justices .\nJustice Thomas \u2019 dissent found that the government did not make a strong showing that it would ultimately succeed on the merits and that the statutory authority does not confer the power to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to authorize a vaccine mandate.13 The dissenting Justices disagreed with the majority that the provisions the government relied on to enforce the rule provided the necessary statutory authority to mandate a vaccine for 10 million health care workers and stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authority to authorize a vaccine mandate across all CMS funded facilities , it would have specifically said so .\nThe dissenting opinion written by Justice Alito found that stronger statutory proof was required by the federal government to show that it has the authority to mandate a vaccine for 10 million health care workers and that it lacked the authority to implement a vaccine mandate in manner that it did .\nUnder our Constitution , the authority to make laws that impose obligations on the American people is conferred on Congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nElected representatives solicit the views of their constituents , listen to their complaints and requests , and make a great effort to accommodate their concerns .\nToday , how- ever , most federal law is not made by Congress .\nIt comes in the form of rules issued by unelected administrators .\nIn or- der to give individuals and entities who may be seriously impacted by agency rules at least some opportunity to make their views heard and to have them given serious consideration , Congress has clearly required that agencies comply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare cases , an agency must provide public notice of proposed rules , 5 U. S. C. \u00a7553 ( b ) ; the public must be given the opportunity to comment on those proposals , \u00a7553 ( c ) ; and if the agency issues the rule , it must address concerns raised during the notice-and-comment process\u2026 The rule may then be challenged in court , and the court may declare the rule unlawful if these procedures have not been followed.15 Justice Alito pointed out that the public notice and comment period may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good cause is shown and the rule must be \u201c narrowly construed and only reluctantly countenanced.\n\u201d He said CMS failed to meet this requirement when it took 10 months after the vaccine was widely available to enact the vaccine mandate on health care workers.16 Justice Alito wrote , \u201c Today \u2019 s decision will ripple through administrative agencies \u2019 future decision making \u201d and warns of its effect on future federal government actions.17 Justices Sotomayor , Kagen and Breyer have been called out by the media for providing misinformation about COVID-19 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sotomeyer stated that the Omicron variant is as deadly as the Delta variant and that the unvaccinated are far more likely to get and transmit the virus than the vaccinated .\nBoth of these assertions are false and do not acknowledge naturally acquired immunity.18 19 20 21 As The Washington Times pointed out in an article entitled \u201c Supreme Court justice letting fear cloud her judgment , \u201d this claim is entirely false.23 During the first week of January 2022 , about 30 percent of intensive care beds in hospitals were filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children who were hospitalized either with COVID , suspected of having COVID , or testing positive for COVID , many were actually hospitalized for an entirely unrelated matter pursuant to data from the Department of Health and Human Services.24 Justice Sotomayor also incorrectly stated , \u201c we are now having deaths at an unprecedented amount.\n\u201d The facts show that the amount of people dying of and with COVID is far less than it was a year ago and are not \u201c unprecedented.\n\u201d The average weekly number of recorded COVID deaths for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was approximately 3,300 a day or 23,100 for the week,25 while the week of Jan. 19 2022 saw 1,754 recorded COVID deaths.26 According to John P. Ioannidis , MD , PhD , a Stanford University professor and physician-scientist , the risk of dying from COVID for younger people is close to zero .\nDr. Ioannidis puts the survival rate for COVID in unvaccinated individuals under the age of 20 at 99.9987 percent .\nIn addition , COVID-19 death statistics are variable as , according to the CDC , only five percent of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a COVID infection , died from COVID alone and not from another cause of death.27 Justice Kagan repeatedly made the false claim that vaccinated people can not spread COVID when the reality is the vaccine does not reliably prevent infection and transmission.28 29 However , it appears that preventing transmission was never the goal of the experimental COVID vaccines that were licensed for use by the FDA .\nEzekiel Emanual , MD , PhD , one member of President Biden \u2019 s hand-picked COVID-19 Advisory Board , commented , \u201c As with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent serious and deadly outcomes , not to prevent all cases of transmission and infection.\n\u201d 30 In August 2021 , CDC director Rochelle Walensky , MD warned that fully vaccinated people who are not symptomatic could still spread the virus due to \u201c breakthrough \u201d infections .\nShe said , \u201c Our vaccines are working exceptionally well .\nThey continue to work well with \u2018 Delta \u2019 with regard to severe illness and death , but what they can \u2019 t do anymore is prevent transmission.\n\u201d 31 A study in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vaccine only minimally reduced transmission of the virus , while another study showed that people infected with the Delta variant who had previously received the vaccine were less likely to transmit the virus to close contacts , but that protection waned considerably after three months.32 A large study by the CDC showed that prior infection with COVID-19 provided even better protection against re-infection with the virus than provided by vaccination alone .\nDuring the week of Oct. 3 , 2021 , a study comparing individuals who had either no prior SARS-CoV-2 infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccinated had a five-to-six fold lower rate of confirmed infection while those who had survived a previous infection showed between a 15-29 fold lower rate of confirmed infection .\nCDC epidemiologist , Benjamin Silk explains : Many health care professionals working on the front lines in hospitals and other medical facilities have presumably been exposed to and recovered from COVID since the pandemic began almost two years ago .\nThese findings have raised questions about the purpose of mandating a vaccine in the workplace that has proven to be ineffective at preventing infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and why the Supreme Court failed to acknowledge the more robust protection against the disease offered by prior infection .\nScott Atlas , MD , a former White House COVID-19 Task Force adviser said that CMS \u2019 s denial of natural immunity in their vaccine mandate is , without precedent .\nHe stated , It appears that the justices were not provided with all the information they needed and some relied on incorrect data and misinformation to make their decision .\nAs a Washington Times columnist put it , \u201c Fear has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sotomayor wants to express an opinion on vaccine mandates or any other issue for that matter , the least she can do is get the facts.\n\u201d 35 The Supreme Court Decision to Mandate the COVID-19 Vaccine for Health Care Workers Conflicts with Some State Laws Christina Pushaw , communications director for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis stated that the Supreme Court \u2019 s opinion was contrary to existing Florida law , which prohibits vaccine mandates .\nShe said Governor DeSantis will be evaluating the next steps , reiterating his position that no COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pushaw emphasized that Florida law protects the right for all healthare workers in the state to receive a personal belief or medical exemption to receipt of COVID vaccine : Montana and Texas have similar laws and Executive Orders banning forced vaccination as a condition of employment.37 38 It is not yet clear how states that have banned vaccine mandates will address the recent Supreme Court decision .\nBills Have Been Introduced to Render the Supreme Court Decision Null and Void U.S. Congresswomen Cathy McMorris Rodgers , who is a member of the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dec. 9 , 2021 , House Republicans introduced a resolution under the Congressional Review Act to end the health care workers vaccine mandate .\nU.S .\nCongressman Jedd Duncan stated : Many bills seeking to ban employer vaccine mandates for health care workers have been filed in multiple states.41 These bills may be able to provide protections for health care workers

restrictions by several European countries\u2014starting with Denmark\u2014during the past two weeks , the United States seems to be on the verge of following Europe \u2019 s lead in declaring the pandemic over .\nIn a recent interview with the Financial Times , White House chief medical advisor and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) Anthony Fauci , MD said the \u201c full blown \u201d pandemic is almost over and he expressed confidence that COVID restrictions could \u201c soon \u201d be lifted in the U.S.1 2 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 Dr. Fauci said : U.S. Government Feeling Pressure to Move Past the Pandemic Besides growing peer pressure from European governments to adopt an attitude of learning to live with COVID , a key reason the Biden administration may now be more open to ending COVID restrictions is that public opinion polls in the U.S. are showing that many Americans have grown disillusioned with government COVID control policies that they feel have largely failed .\nA recent poll done by Monmouth University Polling Institute found 70 percent of those surveyed agree with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we accept that COVID is here to say and we just need to get on with our lives.\n\u201d 9 According to the institute \u2019 s director , Patrick Murray : Another poll by Yahoo !\n/YouGov found that 46 percent of those surveyed think that Americans should \u201c learn to live with \u201d the pandemic \u201c and get back to normal.\n\u201d In that same poll , only 43 percent think \u201c we need to do more to vaccinate , wear masks and test.\n\u201d 9 There has been speculation that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the pandemic , sooner rather than later .\nThe midterm national elections in the U.S. are scheduled for later this year and some Democrats who are up for re-election do not want the lack of progress in eradicating COVID to be an issue of contention .\nAn article in the Daily Mail cited the example of Democratic Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney of New York , who was asked if it was important for Democrats to be \u201c seen as moving on from the pandemic ahead of the midterms.\n\u201d 9 Planning for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be Underway Last week , the Associated Press ( AP ) reported that the Biden administration is \u201c making plans for a less-disruptive phase of the national virus response \u201d and that the White House \u201c for the first time acknowledged movement in its planning , saying conversations have been under way privately to develop plans for guiding the country away from the emergency phase of the pandemic.\n\u201d 13 According to the AP : It \u2019 s probably na\u00efve to assume that U.S. government decisions with regard to COVID and the imminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been strictly enforced so far would be based solely on a scientific rationale and in totally unrelated political factors .\nU.S. Government Looking for Ways to Declare Victory Over COVID So the question is : \u201c How does the government make a rational case for dropping all or most COVID restrictions , declaring victory over the pandemic and moving on ?\n\u201d One way to build a case is to show that the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections are on a consistently steep decline .\nDuring the first week in February , the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the country\u2014from 453,141 cases to 239,757 .\nThe problem is that the number of people who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 has tended to be cyclical over the past two years , depending on the season of the year and the number of people who choose to get tested.9 To declare victory over COVID based on a downward trend in SARS-CoV-2 infections might risk a repetition of what happened after President Biden declared \u201c independence from the virus \u201d in his 2021 Fourth of July speech to the nation .\nThe Delta variant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infections went back up .\nThen Omicron hit and the number of infections went up again .\nHow often can someone declare victory , be proven wrong and still maintain some semblance of credibility ?\n14 15 One solution to that dilemma would be to do what the government of Sweden did earlier this month\u2014simply stop testing for SARS-CoV-2 .\nThe AP reported : \u201c We have reached a point where the cost and relevance of the testing is no longer justifiable , \u201d said the head of Sweden \u2019 s Public Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , PhD.2 Another solution would be to show a consistent , marked decrease in the number of Americans being hospitalized for COVID and dying of the illness .\nDuring the past week , COVID hospitalizations have been declining through the U.S. , but that has happened before over the last two years .\nHospitalizations for COVID have also gone up and down , depending on the season of the year .\nSo there is no guarantee that hospitalizations would not take an embarrassing upward turn .\nGovernment officials need some assurance that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the pandemic , COVID hospitalizations will continue to decline and get the point where they are barely noticeable .\nThis could be why the administration is working on \u201c recalculating the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations \u201d in the U.S.16 Federal Task Force Wants U.S .\nHospitals to Be More Accurate in How They Report COVID Cases A recent article by Politico cited the existence of a \u201c task force \u201d of \u201c scientists and data specialists \u201d from the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) and Centers for Disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are \u201c working with hospitals nationwide to improve COVID-19 reporting.\n\u201d 16 The Politico article confirmed that two senior administration officials said the task force is asking hospitals around the country to report the number of patients who are hospitalized because they have COVID and separate those from the patients who are hospitalized for other reasons but test positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus after being admitted.16 \u201c You need a panel of experts to review the cases to adjudicate if a hospitalization is for a person who came in for COVID or with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MD , a former advisory board member of The COVID Tracking Project.16 17 What this suggests is that , in the past , U.S. hospitals have been counting people hospitalized for reasons other than COVID as COVID patients if they happened to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 after admission .\nThis would have the effect of increasing hospital COVID case counts , making the effects of COVID on U.S. hospitals appear worse than they actually were .\nRemember all those media reports about how overwhelmed hospitals were with COVID patients ?\nIt now appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been inaccurate , even grossly inaccurate .\nIf implemented , this strategy of recalculating COVID hospitalizations will surely have the effect of lowering COVID hospitalization cases counts .\nIt will help pave the way for a declaration that COVID , although not vanquished , is something we can learn to live with .\nThere is an element of smoke and mirrors at play here , but it is unlikely that most Americans will ever notice .\nIf you would like to receive

District Court in Texas Blocks Federal Employee COVID Vaccine Mandate", "content": "On Jan. 21 , 2022 , a Federal District Court in Texas temporarily blocked COVID-19 mandate for federal workers issued by the Biden administration.1 Judge Jeffrey Brown \u2019 s ruling applies nationwide.2 The federal worker mandate was issued on Sept. 9 , 2021 .\nAccording to the White House , as of December 2021 , 97 percent of federal employees had been vaccinated after the mandate was announced.3 Only One of Four Federal COVID Vaccine Mandates Has Survived Court Review The Biden administration has attempted to enforce four vaccine mandates nationwide .\nWhile all of the mandates have faced challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjudicated by the Supreme Court , which ruled against the private employer mandate but upheld the healthcare worker mandate .\nThe Federal District Court in Texas ruled on the other two mandates , Executive Order 14042 , which requires businesses that contract with the federal government to require its employees to be vaccinated , and Executive Order 14043 requiring all federal employees to be vaccinated .\nSince Executive Order 14042 was already stayed by another court , Judge Brown did not order any other preliminary relief , but he granted plaintiffs a preliminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom line is that only one of the four federal COVID vaccine mandates\u2014the vaccine mandate for health care workers\u2014has survived after court review.5 In order to be granted a preliminary injunction , the party asking for relief must show they are likely to succeed on the merits ; that irreparable injury would result if the relief was not granted ; that the balance of the equities is in their favor , and that it is in the public \u2019 s interest .\n\u201c Choosing Between One \u2019 s Job and An Unwanted Medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Federal District Court in Texas deferred to the 5th Circuit Court \u2019 s determination that choosing between one \u2019 s job and getting an \u201c unwanted medical procedure that can \u2019 t be undone \u201d amounted to irreparable injury .\nThe judges ruled that : The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits because the Biden administration lacked the statutory and constitutional authority to issue a vaccine mandate for federal employees .\nBy balancing the equities , the government \u2019 s interest in protecting citizens from COVID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not undergoing a forced medical procedure that can \u2019 t be undone , the court found that the public \u2019 s interest can be achieved by less restrictive means such as masking or social distancing .\nThe court quoted the 5th Circuit Court ruling : Additionally , as the Fifth Circuit has observed , \u201c [ t ] he public interest is also served by maintaining our constitutional structure and maintaining the liberty of individuals to make intensely personal decisions according to their own convictions .\nOSHA , 17 F.4th at 618 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ no legitimate interest in enforcing \u201c an unlawful \u201d mandate .\nId .\nAll in all , this court has determined that the balance of the equities tips in the plaintiffs \u2019 favor , and that enjoining the federal-worker mandate is in the public interest.7 The court found that the federal COVID vaccine mandate exceeded the president \u2019 s authority and required Congressional approval before ordering millions of federal workers to be vaccinated as a condition of employment\u2026 The court notes at the outset that this case is not about whether folks should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should .\nIt is not even about the federal government \u2019 s power , exercised properly , to mandate vaccination of its employees .\nIt is instead about whether the President can , with the stroke of a pen and without the input of Congress , require millions of federal employees to undergo a medical procedure as a condition of their employment .\nThat , under the current state of the law as just recently expressed by the Supreme Court , is a bridge too far.8 The court relied on the recent Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined that while OSHA may regulate workplace safety standards , they may not impose public health measures .\nMandating a vaccine for public health crisis is not within the purview of workplace safety standards.9 White House Press Secretary , Jen Psaki disagreed with the court ruling and said , \u201c We are confident in our legal authority.\n\u201d 11 The Biden administration has appealed the decision and plans to take the matter to the U.S. Supreme court.12

seven million federal workers will not be forced to decide between their jobs and getting the COVID vaccine .\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in

my concerns to leadership about the loss of trust in public health .\n\u201c Harm will happen , \u201d I was told .\n\u201c Public Health addresses the immediate physical danger first , then deals with the repercussions.\n\u201d I watched for 18 months as our new \u2018 public health \u2019 policies exacerbated inequality , drug abuse , child endangerment , and mental illness .\nMy director responded by accepting more grant money to address these very issues .\nI was implementing policies that negatively affected the poor and racial minorities while our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis and receiving dollars to fight it .\nI was helping to trap people in isolation and despair while a coworker wrote about the impending mental health crisis and won a grant from the American Rescue Plan .\nI was watching our agency coerce people to take vaccines , which severely decreases trust , and then use federal grant funds to address vaccine hesitancy .\nWhile the families I saw were losing their livelihoods , my director was posing for pictures with the governor who enforced the closure of their workplaces .\nTolkien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The hearts of men are easily corrupted.\n\u201d One

them breakfast and lunch .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand she could still access school meals .\nThe school district required families to be physically present at the school and provide proof that they were residents of the district\u2014each day\u2014in order to take home meals .\nFor a woman with 4 small children and no access to a vehicle , this was impossible .\nI emailed the school to ask if I could vouch for the family and deliver the meals for the kids .\nI was denied .\nThe family went without until the father was completely without work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up the meals .\nMany of the families I served were undocumented immigrants and unable to file for unemployment or rent assistance .\nMost lost their income overnight .\nHead Start closed , forcing low-income parents to leave children with unlicensed childcare providers so that they could attempt to find a new job in an \u201c essential \u201d industry .\nOne mom told me her 18-month-old would cry when she left him with an old lady in an apartment full of kids .\nHe seemed \u2018 different \u2019 ever since she started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t feel she had any other choice .\nAs these children were placed in potentially unsafe situations , many in the laptop class would remark to me that they enjoyed the cost savings of not having to put their kids in full time daycare .\nIt was no surprise to me when the American Academy of Pediatrics declared a national emergency of pediatric mental health in October 2021 .\nMany who work closely with children felt as though we were screaming into the void that this would happen and were just met with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People had confused resilient with adaptable .\nChildren will adapt to any environment they are placed in , including toxic ones .\nThis does not mean they are innately resilient ; the problems often manifest in adulthood , particularly when they come to have their own children .\nThe current sharp decline in the mental health of children is only the tip of

prisoner in her own home .\nShe was unable to leave because she could not handle that many children in public by herself .\nHer mother used to help , but was at high risk for COVID complications and

.\nSummer came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids outside because the one who was nonverbal would run through the neighborhood .\nI called her every week for nearly a year and I would hear the desperation in her voice .\nShe would yell at the kids in the background and tell me she felt like she was going crazy ; her children had been without therapies for months .\nShe tried to get online counseling for herself , but it was hard to find the space in her home for privacy .\nAnother mother had struggled with suicidal ideation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difficult time making it to her counseling appointments .\nAt one point when I called her , she told me she had been in the bathroom the week prior with a bottle of pills .\nThinking about her children caused her to put it down .\nI thanked her for her courage and we came up with a plan and made an appointment with her psychiatrist .\nThen I hung up the phone and cried .\nWhen I caught up with her a few months later , she told me that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With 3 young kids , one of whom would later be diagnosed with autism , she was overwhelmed when their Head Start program closed .\nFamilies were terrified of catching COVID and some skipped appointments for themselves or their children because they perceived clinics as dangerous .\nI discovered later that one family was refusing to allow their boys , ages six and eight , outside to play because of the fear of catching COVID from the air .\nThey stayed in the small , cluttered apartment for many weeks watching TV and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in summer , they had gained significant amounts of weight .\nOne mother described symptoms of mastitis and I pleaded with her to go to urgent care but she refused because she was too afraid of COVID .\nAnother young mother would not take her child to get his 18-month vaccines because of a fear of contracting COVID .\nI tried to explain that pertussis is far more dangerous to her child , but the fear had taken root .\nI had always understood that the role of Public Health was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support them in making healthy choices .\nWe were supposed to use facts and data to dispel fear .\nBut now , Public Health began to routinely distort and exaggerate data to fit their narrative .\nEmails between the Minnesota Health Department and Governor Walz \u2019 s staff appear to do just this .\nThe communications director at our own local agency asked us to find a young healthy person who had ended up hospitalized in order to illustrate the dangers of COVID to young people .\nSince the actual dangers to young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never found anyone in our community to fit her profile .\nBut someone else did .\nHow could I convey to the mother with mastitis that the urgent care was safe if I , myself wasn \u2019 t permitted into her

about taking him to the clinic for his vaccines ?\nIt felt completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral distress .\nEvery time I asked what the goal was to return to visiting families in their homes , I was given the same answer : \u201c Let me check into it.\n\u201d Who had decided to stop in-person nursing services ?\nI couldn \u2019 t always tell because no one seemed to want to take that responsibility .\nThe State Health department had told us to do what we were comfortable with as an agency .\nSometimes I was told it was the safety and compliance officer , sometimes it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nurses themselves did not want to return in person\u2014which I understood .\nFor the first time in my career , I didn \u2019 t have to worry about childcare , rush hour , or getting up in time to take a shower before work .\nI didn \u2019 t have to sit in a cramped , hot , smelly apartment with someone \u2019 s boogery child crawling all over me .\nI was pregnant with my fourth child and far more comfortable staying home .\nBut that convenience didn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe families that were part of our program made it possible for people like me to stay home .\nThey went to work in grocery stores , restaurants , packing school lunches , construction , and working as nursing assistants in long-term care .\nThen the vaccines came .\nMany had already recovered from COVID and found it to be mild , myself included .\nThey were wary of the vaccine or felt they didn \u2019 t need it because they had already had the illness .\nBut Public Health insisted through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order for us to feel safe around these people , they must get vaccinated .\nA few days after my baby was born , our agency received its first shipment of the long awaited mRNA vaccines .\nWe were short-staffed , so I called my manager and let her know that I would be willing to return 1-2 days per week to give vaccines .\nI was determined to do my part in ending the pandemic in order to get back to normal for the families on my caseload ( not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall telling people that they were 95 percent protected from ever getting COVID at all .\nIt was a hopeful and exciting time that was extremely short-lived .\nWithin months , we had people asking us just to give them a filled out vaccine card so that they could enter lotteries and earn incentives from Krispy Kreme .\nOne of our nurses had someone tell her he would give her his stimulus check if she would just fill out the card .\nOf course , we declined these requests and bribes .\nBy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state health department that we could start opening a 10-dose vial for 1 person and waste the other nine doses , something that was unconscionable just weeks prior .\nThen things started to turn even more sinister .\nOne afternoon , a young man sat down at my vaccine station in an angry manner .\nI asked what was going on , he said , \u201c I \u2019 m only here because my work is telling me I have to get this to keep my job.\n\u201d I set down my alcohol swab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 m sorry sir , but I can \u2019 t give you this vaccine if you are being coerced.\n\u201d ( At that time , I understood this to be the policy of public health . )\nHe looked surprised .\nI told him that he appeared capable of making his own medical decisions and I could not take part in coercion .\nHe and I chatted for a while about his personal risk factors for COVID , the known potential side effects of the vaccine , etc .\nIn the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , so I put my gloves back on and gave it to him .\nBut the incident haunted me .\nAfter that , I tried to avoid working at COVID vaccine clinics .\nBut there was one that I ended up working at in September at a local community college .\nWhile sitting there with nearly no one showing up , I recounted this story to the nurse I was with to see what she thought about it .\n\u201c We are at the point where people need to be forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart sank

Transparent With the American Public on COVID", "content": "An article published this past weekend in The New York Times highlights a glaring problem with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and its policy recommendations related to the pandemic during the past two years .\nThe problem has to do with lack of transparency regarding hospitalizations for COVID-19 and the effectiveness of vaccinations for the illness.1 2 The Times article , written by Apoorva Mandavilli , starts out : The CDC has shared only a \u201c tiny fraction \u201d of its COVID data with the American public ?\nFormer CDC Director Thinks Agency Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to CDC spokesperson , Kristen Nordlund , one of the reasons for the lack of data transparency is because \u201c basically , at the end of the day , [ the data is ] not yet ready for prime time , \u201d noting that the CDC \u2019 s \u201c priority when gathering any data is to ensure that it \u2019 s accurate and actionable.\n\u201d 1 In an interview with Fox News , former CDC director Robert Redfield , MD confirmed this view , saying\u2026 But Dr. Redfield suggested that he disagreed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes whatever data the CDC collects should \u201c absolutely get out there in real-time.\n\u201d He added : CDC Reluctance to Track COVID \u201c Breakthrough Cases \u201d Due to Fear of Contributing to Vaccine Hesitancy Nordlund reportedly said that another reason for the CDC \u2019 s hesitancy to be more transparent was due to fear that its data might be misinterpreted\u2014that information about the number of fully vaccinated people \u201c breakthrough \u201d SARS-CoV-2 infections , for example , could lead to concerns about the effectiveness of the COVID shots.1 2 Epidemiologist Jessica Malaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the team that ran The COVID Tracking Project,5 dismissed the CDC worries about incomplete data being misinterpreted .\nShe said , \u201c We are at a much greater risk of misinterpreting the data with data vacuums , than sharing the data with proper science , communication and caveats.\n\u201d During the past two years , the CDC has frequently been criticized for its COVID and COVID vaccine data collection practices , its mixed and confusing messaging and a growing perception that the agency has not been fully transparent with the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 Perhaps one of the clearest examples of the CDC \u2019 s failure to provide timely and accurate COVID-related information is the agency \u2019 s inability or unwillingness to adequately track the number of cases in which fully vaccinated ( and boosted ) individuals have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 .\nBecause of this , it is not known how many \u201c breakthrough cases \u201d there have been in the United States .\nConsequently , there is no way to know for sure how effective the COVID shots have been in preventing the spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis represents a huge and fundamental scientific knowledge gap underlying the primary tool the U.S. government has aggressively pushed on the American people to deal with COVID .\nBut this is only part of the problem .\nThat other part has to do with the lack of reliable information regarding the number of people in the U.S. who have been hospitalized with COVID .\nIn April 2021 , the CDC arbitrarily decided to stop tracking coronavirus breakthrough cases so that it could focus on tracking only breakthrough cases that resulted in hospitalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this major change in policy would allow the agency to more accurately gauge the number of vaccinated people being hospitalized for COVID and , by extension , the overall number of people hospitalized for the illness.12 CDC System for Tracking COVID Hospitalizations in Need of Overhaul But it has recently come to light that the system the CDC has been using to count COVID hospitalizations is deeply flawed .\nAccording to an article in Politico on Feb. 7 , 2021 titled \u201c Biden officials trying to recalculate U.S. Covid-19 hospitalizations , \u201d the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work with \u201c hospitals nationwide to improve COVID-19 reporting.\n\u201d The task force wants hospitals to report the number of patients who are hospitalized because they have COVID and separate those from the patients who are hospitalized for other reasons but test positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus after being admitted.17 18 As reported by The Vaccine Reaction earlier this month : What this suggests is that , in the past , U.S. hospitals have been counting people hospitalized for reasons other than COVID as COVID patients if they happened to test positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the effect of increasing hospital COVID case counts , making the effects of COVID on U.S. hospitals appear worse than they actually were .\nRemember all those media reports about how overwhelmed hospitals were with COVID patients ?\nIt now appears that at least some of that reporting may have been inaccurate , even grossly inaccurate.18 So not only do we not know how effective the COVID shots have been in real-world circumstances , we do not know how many vaccinated ( or unvaccinated ) people have been hospitalized for COVID\u2014which means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people have actually died of COVID , in general .\nIt is no wonder the CDC has consistently found it so difficult to be forthcoming .\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week , click here .", "author": "Marco

Adams , has been sued by 18 plaintiffs including five Orthodox Jews and a Roman Catholic who are suing on behalf of their minor children over the \u2018 key to NYC \u2019 vaccine mandate .\nThe plaintiffs , who are suing the mayor in federal district court in Brooklyn , claim that the vaccine passport system is an \u201c unprecedented abuse of power.\n\u201d 1 The vaccine passport system , which former mayor Bill de Blasio executed as an emergency executive order two years ago,2 is now being operated by Mayor Adams and prohibits all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaces and social life available in the city .\nThe plaintiffs allege that the vaccine passport system violates the 1st , 4th and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and creates a two-tiered system whereby the unvaccinated are deprived of their constitutional rights .\nThe plaintiff \u2019 s attorney said : The intention and effect of Key to NYC is to create a two-tiered society in the city of New York , in which those who decline to be vaccinated against COVID-19 will be reduced to the status of second-class citizens , deprived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to injection .\nNever in the history of this country , nor in the history of pandemics generally , has any government declared an entire class of citizens personae non gratae based on refusal to be vaccinated , much less with vaccines now known to be ineffective at preventing transmission of a communicable disease and to be unnecessary for children , who have an infinitesimal risk of death from COVID-19.3 COVID Vaccines Can \u2019 t Prevent Transmission , Should Not Be Required The \u2018 Key to NYC \u2019 system requires every business owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor \u2019 s vaccine passport rules and forbids any patron or employee from entering their establishment if they have not received a minimum of one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine .\nNo religious or medical exemptions are acknowledged or permitted.4 As of Dec. 14 , 2021 , New Yorkers five to 11 years of age were required to show proof of at least one dose of COVID vaccine and by Dec. 27 , those 12 years old and older needed to show proof of two doses of COVID vaccines in order to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for breaking these rules start at $ 1,000 and escalate up to $ 5,000 with repeat offenses.6 In their 96-page Complaint , the plaintiffs point out that the COVID vaccines have failed to prevent infection with or the transmission of the most recent variants of COVID .\nAccordingly , the plaintiffs contend that because the vaccines have proven ineffective at preventing transmission of the latest COVID variants , that the reasoning behind the \u2018 Key to NYC \u2019 program is to punish the unvaccinated.8 Citing a study by Johns Hopkins University that found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good by having a \u201c devastating effect \u201d on the economy and no noticeable effect on decreasing COVID deaths,9 the plaintiffs \u2019 attorney , Christopher Ferrara , said , \u201c We \u2019 ve never seen anything like it in the history of this country ; the damage they caused is beyond human calculation.\n\u201d The plaintiffs \u2019 objection to the COVID vaccines are due to religious reasons .\nWhile the COVID vaccines do not contain fetal tissue like some other vaccines , fetal cell lines were used in the research and development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the plaintiffs escaped communism in the Soviet Union to live in what he thought was a free city in a free country , only to be told he must show his papers upon trying to enter the Javits Convention Center.11 It is Not the First Time the \u2018 Key to NYC \u2019 Has Been Challenged This is not the first lawsuit filed against the mayors for the \u2018 Key to NYC \u2019 vaccine mandate .\nOver the summer , the Independent Restaurant Owners Association Rescue ( IROAR ) representing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Brooklyn brought a lawsuit against Mayor de Blasio alleging that the vaccine passport system is arbitrary , discriminatory and severely impacted their ability to conduct businesses.13 The IROAR argue that the \u2018 Key to NYC \u2019 is unfair and arbitrary because it only applies to restaurants and gyms and not grocery stores , pharmacies , hair salons or other public gathering places where the risk of contracting the virus would be similar .\nIn addition , the restaurant owners argue that performers such as singers or comedians performing in a bar or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vaccination unless they are New York City residents or residents of the \u2018 Key to NYC \u2019 establishment.14 The plaintiff \u2019 s point out that using NYC \u2019 s own data , only 1.7 percent of total cases were contracted in a bar , while nearly three quarters of the cases can be attributed to private gatherings , yet bars and restaurants are unfairly targeted with restrictions.15 Some restaurant owners argue that allowing vaccinated dinners to eat inside while forcing the unvaccinated to sit outside is segregation akin to banning customers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay .\nBecause certain demographics in the population are less likely to be vaccinated , many contend that the vaccine mandate is discriminatory.16 Fox News \u2019 Tucker Carlson questioned , Weren \u2019 t we told it \u2019 s racist to require ID for voting , but now it \u2019 s not racist to require ID for people to go inside of buildings in our largest city ?\nSo what does this mean for the 72 percent of young African Americans who are not vaccinated ?\nThey \u2019 re not going to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the principles of equity , has a disparate impact .\nThat \u2019 s the phrase they use to describe racism in action .\nIt affects some groups more profoundly than others .\nAnd the group most affected by this is young African Americans.17 According to the complaint , \u2018 the Key to NYC \u2019 is arbitrary due to the fact that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has admitted that COVID transmissible among the vaccinated as well as the unvaccinated .\nThe complaint sets forth that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vaccinated individuals can both contract COVID and the so-called \u2018 Delta \u2019 variant , further illustrating the arbitrariness of this executive order.\n\u201d 18 Mayor de Blasio responded to the lawsuit saying , \u201c If you want to experience all the greatness that New York City has you can just get the vaccine , \u2019 he said .\n\u2018 This is the way we stay heathy and bring back our city fully.\n\u201d 19 New York State and Other Big Cities Lift Vaccine Mandates The city of Philadelphia no longer requires vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feb. 10 , 2022 , Minneapolis and St. Paul have lifted their vaccine or test emergency rules and mask mandates.21 Chicago and Cook Counties announced a similar roll-back of their COVID restrictions including lifting the vaccine and mask mandate.22 Washington , DC will rescind its requirement that forced people to show proof of vaccination and wear masks starting Mar .\n1.23 And , while the state of New York has lifted their mask requirement , the key to NYC remains in place.24 All eyes remain on the mayor of New York City as @ @ @ @ @

second dose of Pfizer/BioNTech \u2019 s BNT162b2 ( also known as \u201c Comirnaty \u201d ) messenger RNA ( mRNA ) COVID-19 vaccine , died due to myocarditis , according to a study published in the journal Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine on Feb. 14 2022.1 The boys , whose names have not been released to the public , were found dead in their beds a few days after they were vaccinated .\nNeither boy had a history of medical problems and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any symptoms , namely headache and stomach ache , in the days preceding death .\nNotably , signs of cardiac distress were absent for both boys before they died .\nThe Connecticut and Michigan medical examiners , who authored the study detailing autopsy findings , identified signs of an unusual type of myocarditis with hyper-eosinophilic myocytes in \u201c these post-vaccine hearts , \u201d which occurs in the presence of excessive inflammation .\nRather than the typical hallmark of myocarditis , the medical examiners wrote that , While the medical examiners do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have contributed to the deaths of the boys after the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine , their conclusion was that the primary cause of death was myocardial injury .\nThey decided to make their findings public and warn doctors that heart problems occurring after COVID vaccination may manifest differently than typical

.\nAlthough myocarditis may be caused by infections , \u201c more commonly the myocarditis is a result of the body \u2019 s immune reaction to the initial heart damage \u201d according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders.5 CDC Does Not Count All Post-COVID Vaccine Myocarditis-Related Deaths The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) presents data to its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) , a committee appointed by the Secretary of Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations , including whether to approve a vaccine for certain age groups .\nWhen COVID vaccine recipients do not have myocarditis symptoms and do not seek medical treatment before dying from COVID vaccine-induced atypical myocarditis , the CDC does not include them in the data it presents to ACIP because the COVID vaccine-related deaths don \u2019 t meet the strict definition of myocarditis\u2014even if that is what killed them .\nTo meet the CDC \u2019 s definition of myocarditis , the

Reports of Myocarditis After COVID Vaccinations Unfortunately , there have been many reports of young people dying of myocarditis after receiving a COVID vaccine .\nRecently , in New York , a

.\nThe autopsy report showed that he suffered from myocarditis .\nDespite the evidence that Jacob suffered from an enlarged heart after receiving the COVID vaccines , the CDC decided that there was no causal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day he died.9 These deaths are not isolated incidences .\nThe CDC , hospitals and Universities recently published a study that looked at data reported to the Vaccine Adverse

Action on COVID Vaccine-Related Myocarditis Cases Cases of myocarditis following COVID vaccination have prompted other countries to take action to protect their citizens .\nIn the fall , the Nordic

inserts .\nIsrael also made the connection between Pfizer/BioNTech shot and cases of myocarditis in young men.12 If you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction

The Results Are Stunning.", "content": "To understand why the CDC made the change , don \u2019 t look to science .\nLook to public choice theory .\nOn Feb. 25 , 2022 , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) made its expected announcement that it was updating its framework to monitor and contain COVID-19 .\n\u201c We \u2019 re in a stronger place today as a nation with more tools to protect ourselves in our communities from COVID , like vaccination , boosters , broader access to testing , availability of high quality masks , accessibility to new treatments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Director Rochelle Paula Walensky .\nMost media headlines focused on the CDC \u2019 s relaxed mask guidelines , which advised that most Americans could ditch masks .\nHow the CDC arrived at this conclusion has received little scrutiny , however .\nAs many people likely noticed , the CDC changed its mask guidance even though COVID cases and COVID mortality remain high .\nAs of Mar .\n1 , daily new cases stood at roughly 60,000 based on its seven-day rolling average , which is significantly higher than last summer and virtually identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 1,600 Americans continue to die each day of COVID , according to government data , a figure that is , again , exponentially higher than last summer and similar to a year earlier .\nWalensky explained the healthy agency \u2019 s reasoning in her call with reporters .\n\u201c With widespread population immunity , the overall risk of severe disease is now generally lower , \u201d Dr. Walensky said , according to the transcript .\n\u201c Now , as the virus continues to circulate in our communities , we must focus our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and direct our efforts toward protecting people at high risk for severe illness and preventing COVID from overwhelming our hospitals and our healthcare systems.\n\u201d There are two takeaways here .\nThe first is that Dr. Walensky \u2019 s call to direct efforts \u201c toward protecting people at high risk for severe illness \u201d sounds a bit like the Focused Protection strategy many public health experts and epidemiologists have been advocating all along , some of whom were labeled \u201c fringe \u201d scientists by the government \u2019 s top infectious disease bureaucrats .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Dr. Walensky reached this conclusion .\nDuring the call , Dr. Greta Massetti of the CDC noted that \u201c 70 percent of Americans are in areas with low or medium COVID-19 community levels.\n\u201d Just days before , however , CDC data showed the vast majority of U.S. counties were suffering from high transmission .\nThen , virtually overnight , most of the U.S. suddenly was in the low or medium category .\nMassetti explains the CDC simply changed the formula it used to measure community transmission , or \u201c updated metrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says .\n\u201c A community \u2019 s COVID-19level is determined by a combination of three pieces of information , \u201d Dr. Massetti explained , \u201c new hospitalizations for COVID-19 , current hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients or hospital capacity , and new COVID -9 cases.\n\u201d By simply changing its formula to include hospitalizations and hospital capacity , the CDC took the vast majority of the U.S. from a state of high community transmission to low or moderate .\nThe color red is also conspicuously absent .\n\u2018 It \u2019 s Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ?\nMany people likely are not angry that the CDC changed its COVID risk formula .\nThe changes are likely going to allow most Americans to resume life in a somewhat normal fashion again , without being forced to show vaccine passports to eat in a restaurant or wear a mask to go to yoga class or run to the grocery store .\nNumerous surveys show this increasingly is what Americans want .\nA recent Yahoo !\nNews/YouGov poll showed that 46 percent of respondents believed Americans should \u201c learn to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to normal , \u201d while only 43 percent said , \u201c we need to do more to vaccinate , wear masks and test.\n\u201d Meanwhile , a Monmouth University poll found that 70 percent of Americans agreed with this statement : \u201c it \u2019 s time we accept COVID is here to stay and we just need to get on with our lives.\n\u201d The same poll also showed sharp drops in support for vaccine mandates , social distancing , and mask mandates .\nNew York Times writer Nate Cohn observed something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American mood .\n\u201c The [ polling ] results are especially striking at a time when coronavirus cases , hospitalizations and even deaths are near record highs , \u201d Cohn wrote in February .\n\u201c Indeed , the same polls showed that the public \u2019 s concern about the virus increased during the Omicron wave .\nBut in a telling indication of the public \u2019 s attitudes toward the pandemic , greater worry about the virus has not translated to greater support for measures to stop its spread.\n\u201d The CDC \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk formula appears to be a response to this change in mood .\nMany will contend that this is not how \u201c science \u201d is supposed to work , and they \u2019 d be correct .\nBut pandemic policies were never \u201c scientific \u201d because science can never tell us what we should or must do .\n\u201c [ T ] here is no such thing as a scientific ought , \u201d the economist Ludwig von Mises observed , echoing a famous argument by philosopher David Hume .\n\u201c Science is competent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created by public health officials and politicians .\nAnd public choice theory\u2014a field of economics pioneered by the Nobel Prize-winning economist James M. Buchanan\u2014tells us these people make decisions based on incentives just like everyone else .\nAs I \u2019 ve previously explained , early in the pandemic , the incentive for most public officials was clear : take every precaution necessary to avoid being blamed for COVID deaths\u2014regardless of the efficacy or damage of the policies .\n\u201c It \u2019 s important to remember that politics , above all else , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions that don \u2019 t work and cause serious harms is a better political strategy for most politicians than telling people to act responsibly , wash hands , maintain a prudent distance , and avoid touching your face , \u201d I wrote in 2020 .\n\u201c So if you \u2019 re wondering why our world has begun to resemble a Joseph Heller or Kafka novel where orders and action seem arbitrary , senseless , and counterintuitive , look to public choice theory.\n\u201d Social distancing and masking are not more effective today than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they less effective .\nThe basic science of non-pharmaceutical interventions remains the same , even if some contextual factors of the pandemic have changed ( new variants , the presence of vaccines , etc. )\n.\nThe primary change is the appetite for non-pharmaceutical interventions .\nAmericans have grown tired of them , and this above all else is likely what prompted the CDC to change its COVID risk formula , which virtually overnight took the vast majority of the country from a state of high community transmission to low or moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high .\nThe scary color of red is now gone completely from the CDC \u2019 s graphics .\nAnd all but a handful of Democrats at [ this year \u2019 s ] State of the Union address appeared with faces bare indoors in a crowded Capitol building .\nTo understand why and how it happened , don \u2019 t look to science .\nLook to public choice theory .", "author": "Marco Caceres", "url":

mandating a vaccine passport system in the United States .\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki stated : Although the White House said it would not be involved in a national vaccine passport initiative , many private sector initiatives embarked on the business opportunity to create digital vaccine passports.2 One of these initiatives is the Vaccine Credential Initiative ( VCI ) 3\u2014a voluntary global coalition of public and private stakeholders including Microsoft , Salesforce , Google , Oracle , the Mayo Clinic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health and technology companies , which have been involved in creating a verifiable digital proof of vaccination application called the SMART Health Card.4 5 While the federal government decided not to lead the development of a national vaccine passport , the SMART Health Card has been launched in twenty states , the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.6 At least four more states may eventually provide access to SMART Health Cards .\nBrian Anderson , MD , co-founder of the VCI and chief digital health physician at the MITRE Corporation said : Currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Card is voluntary .\nThe digital application contains the person \u2019

computer code that anyone can use to retrieve verified source of health data and produce the unique QR code .\nThe digital cards are available from more than 400 sources including state health departments , pharmacies and health care organizations.8 QR Code Linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Any State One of the features of the QR code is that it is standardized and interoperable to work in any state .\nA resident of Virginia traveling to San Francisco can use the same SMART Health Card to prove vaccination status in California.9 Stakeholders believe that one of the greatest benefits of the SMART

end of this month .\nStephen White , director of the immunization division at the state \u2019 s health department said : In a global forum on SMART Health Cards , former Governor of Utah Mike Leavitt positioned the health card as an individual \u2019 s right to have digital access to personal health information : Many other countries have adopted the SMART Health Card .\nSome of these countries

.\nThe reign of Baron von M\u00fcnchhausen ( by Proxy ) ( MSBP ) arrived in earnest in 2021 .\nIronically ( or perhaps not ) , it was the promise of a pharmaceutical intervention\u2014vaccines\u2014that kicked MSBP into high gear .\nVaccines were supposed to be our passport to a return to normalcy .\nBut despite the hosannas heaped on them , doubts soon arose about their efficacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sure , but many\u2014did not want to be injected .\nBut at the first signs of this resistance , the MSBP regime kicked in with full force .\nThose who wished to retain control over their bodies were demonized as \u201c anti-vaxxers.\n\u201d The President of the United States repeatedly\u2014and falsely\u2014claimed that the failure of Covid to vanish was because of a \u201c pandemic of the unvaccinated.\n\u201d So of course\u2014for their own good mind you\u2014they had to be compelled to be vaccinated .\nBecause that \u2019 s the MSBP way .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their supposedly altruistic betters were subjected not just to scorn and ridicule by officialdom and corporations and many of their peers , but to a systematic deprivation of their civil rights and of their participation in normal life\u2014employment , dining in public , going to the theater , even exercising alone outdoors .\nIn some countries , the metaphorical passport to a normal life morphed into literal passports to a normal life .\nThis compounding of oppression did not eliminate resistance .\nIt often intensified it .\nBut this only intensified in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the grips of MSBP : how dare our little cares resist our requirements that they be treated ?\nSo the war on liberties\u2014the war on personal autonomy\u2014only escalated .\nIn many countries throughout the world , state goons violently suppressed protestors .\nIn Canada , an effete Prime Minister responded to a robust resistance by declaring an Emergency that empowered the government to seize property ( including bank accounts ) with no due process , merely for having the temerity to prefer personal autonomy and to express that preference through peaceful protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Homeland Security ominously declared that those spreading \u201c misinformation \u201d about vaccines were tantamount to terrorists , and the Surgeon General of the United States demanded that social media companies surrender information about those spreading such misinformation .\nAll of this occurred when evidence\u2014that is , real information\u2014was mounting that ( a ) vaccine efficacy was limited , ( b ) the potential for side effects was real , and ( c ) the vaccines did not inhibit transmission .\nIndeed , even the CDC acknowledged this last crucial fact as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered the M\u00fcnchhausen \u2019 \u201c externality \u201d argument\u2014which was never compelling to begin with\u2014completely moot .\nBut they pressed forward with it nonetheless , relentlessly .\nAt long last , it does seem that the M\u00fcnchhausen \u2019 s grip is loosening .\nCountries around the world are relaxing mandates and requirements as it becomes clear that citizens have finally lost patience with the ministrations of the MSBP clique .\nAlthough it is dissipating , it has not entirely disappeared .\nIn clinical MSBP , children are the most likely victims .\nSo it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nDespite massive evidence\u2014evidence that has been manifest since the earliest days of the pandemic\u2014that children are not at material risk to COVID , they have been the most victimized by MSBP , and their victimization continues .\nThe M\u00fcnchhausen \u2019 s react with fury at any suggestion that children be unmasked\u2014despite the evidence that children are not at risk , that masks are pointless , and masks themselves create physical and mental health problems .\nDespite evidence of serious developmental delay experienced by Zoom students , reopening of schools was achieved only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions : \u201c for the children , \u201d you know .\nNow children as young as five are being targeted for vaccination , with the M\u00fcnchhausen in Chief , the

although the COVID variant of MSBP is ebbing , its virulence suggests that it is a harbinger of future variants .\nPerhaps these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPerhaps they will be triggered by social \u201c diseases \u201d like racism and climate change .\nBut the precedent has been set .\nForcing people to obey the dictates of those clothed with authority for the ostensible purpose of curing their

to identify a future outbreak .\nThe CDC says that , unlike other types of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance , wastewater surveillance does not depend on whether people having access to health care facilities or whether sick people seek health services or whether SARS-CoV-2 testing is readily available .\nSince 80 percent of American households are served by municipal wastewater collection systems , wastewater surveillance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDC has stated that , while the SARS-CoV-2 virus can shed in feces , there is no current information about people getting infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus when directly exposed to treated or untreated wastewater.9 The CDC has said that wastewater surveillance for the virus that causes COVID-19 is a developing field and has many limitations.10 Contradictory data from wastewater surveillance has emerged .\nFor example , several sites in the Chicago area reported SARS-CoV-2 levels had dropped by up to 99 percent from Feb. 27 to Mar .\n13 , 2022 , @ @ @ @ @

Montreal , Canada has shown that wearing face masks interferes with effective communication between people because masks hide parts of our faces used for nonverbal communication expressing our emotions and intentions.1 Shortly after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic , public health officials provided guidelines that everyone must wear face masks to control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.2 Since a significant part of communication among humans involves non-verbal communication , the general public wearing masks became aware that masking had adverse effects on human interaction , particularly among children.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigate how covering the lower part of the face with a mask impacts the ability to recognize basic emotions from facial expressions.4 Sarah McCrackin , postdoctoral fellow at the Laboratory for Social Attention and Cognition at McGill University said : The study examined the ability of 120 participants to recognize basic facial emotions , such as fear , happiness , anger , sadness , disgust , surprise , and neutral by comparing communication between those wearing a mask and those not wearing a mask.6 The study found that face masks reduced

about waning protection for both the original two shots and the booster dose , the FDA decided a second booster dose is needed.3 4 5 6 According to Peter Marks , MD , director of the FDA \u2019 s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research : The U.S. Centers for Disease and Prevention ( CDC ) has also recommended a second booster for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as immunocompromised individuals .\nThe agency further said that adults who have received the original dose of Johnson & Johnson/Janssen \u2019 s Ad26.COV2.S COVID vaccine and a booster dose may now get a second booster dose of

government \u2019 s major operating components , an agency under the Department of Health and Human Services .\nThe CDC \u2019 s mission statement reads , \u201c CDC increases the health security of our nation .\n\u2026 CDC saves lives and protects people from health threats.\n\u201d The agency also pledges to the American people that it will \u201c base all public health decisions on the highest quality scientific data that is derived openly and objectively.\n\u201d Well , COVID-19 has been the nation \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years .\nIt has had a huge impact on the lives of every American .\nDuring those two years , thousands of scientists and health-care researchers have studied COVID and accumulated a huge amount of information on the disease .\nWe \u2019 ve now gradually come to realize that the most effective force that would eventually end the pandemic is natural immunity .\nEven Bill Gates has admitted that \u201c the virus itself , particularly the variant called Omicron , is a type of vaccine.\n\u201d With the rapid spread of Omicron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people have developed natural immunity , which is driving COVID-19 out of its pandemic stage and into endemicity .\nWith its $ 15.4 billion annual budget , one would think the CDC would have done a good job providing taxpayers with data on COVID-19 .\nIf cutting edge research is too challenging for the CDC , they at least should have provided the public with basic surveillance data , such as : \u2022 Who was infected with SARS-CoV-2 , when , which variant , and what were the symptoms ?\n\u2022 Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , and were there any side effects ?\n\u2022 Who was vaccinated , got infected , when , and recovered ?\n\u2022 Who was never vaccinated , and never infected ( never tested , or never tested positive ) ?\nThe CDC \u2019 s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report ( MMWR ) published on Jan. 28 presented some very interesting information from California and New York comparing immunity against COVID-19 from four groups of people , indicating natural immunity alone provides the best protection .\nSince then , I have been anxiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 48 other states , and even for California and New York , important data like this should be updated monthly , if not weekly .\nTo my surprise and disappointment , I have not been able to find any more data on natural immunity from the MMWR since Jan. 28 .\nI am sure they have the data\u2014they just don \u2019 t want to share it with us .\nI \u2019 m beginning to wonder if CDC stands for Center for Data Control .\nThose Recovered From COVID Are Best Protected On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinical Infectious Diseases published a peer-reviewed article titled \u201c Risk of reinfection after seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 : A population-based propensity-score matched cohort study.\n\u201d This Swiss study \u201c observed a 94 % reduction in the hazard of being infected among SARS-CoV-2 seropositive participants , when compared to seronegative controls , > 8 months after serology assessment.\n\u201d This level of protection ( natural immunity ) from SARS-CoV-2 infection ( 94 percent ) is comparable to that of the Pfizer vaccine but lasts longer ( eight months and counting ) .\nIn a peer-reviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Jan. 25 , scientists from Oregon Health & Science University showed in raw data that antibodies derived from previous COVID-19 infection are at least 10 times more potent than that generated by vaccination alone .\nThey still concluded , however , that \u201c Vaccination is highly effective at preventing the most severe outcomes from COVID-19 and should be provided regardless of previous infection status and age.\n\u201d I \u2019 m confused by their conclusion , but happy to see the raw data .\nSimilarly , in my Feb. 5 article \u201c Pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With Deadly Consequences , \u201d I wrote : \u201c Now , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control admits in a report released on Jan. 28 that natural immunity against COVID-19 is superior to any of the available vaccine regimens.\n\u201d A reader commented that she \u201c looked all over the CDC site and could find no such info .\n\u2026 Now who \u2019 s being \u2018 subjective \u2019 ?\n\u201d The reader was right .\nI should have explained in my article that the conclusion I drew was not a direct quote but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDC \u2019 s raw data .\nThe CDC \u2019 s Jan. 28 report included the following chart but neglected to provide a summary comparing protection between vaccinated people without natural immunity and unvaccinated people who recovered from COVID and now have natural immunity .\nIt seems that it \u2019 s necessary to dive a little deeper into the data to elaborate my point , as the authors of the report did not conclude the very obvious .\nPlease bear with me .\nThe above CDC chart shows data from California on protection against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between May 30 , 2021 , and Nov. 20 , 2021 : 1 ) The unvaccinated , with no previous COVID-19 diagnosis ( top solid line ) 2 ) The vaccinated , with no previous COVID-19 diagnosis ( broken line below the solid line ) 3 ) The unvaccinated , with previous diagnosis 4 ) The vaccinated , with previous diagnosis It is obvious that the lines representing 3 ) and 4 ) are superimposing on one another , indicating that vaccination had virtually no impact on protection when a person has recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominates protection over vaccination to a level that made vaccination irrelevant .\nAlthough the biggest difference lies between the unvaccinated with no previous infection and everyone else , the second biggest difference , however , is between the \u201c Vaccinated , no previous COVID-19 diagnosis \u201d line ( vaccine immunity ) and the \u201c Unvaccinated , previous COVID-19 diagnosis \u201d line ( natural immunity ) , with the natural immunity line having a much lower \u201c hazard rate , \u201d meaning better protection .\nThe report also revealed similar findings for New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a weekly report .\nThe chart above is part of the report for the last week of January , and it was for only two of the 50 states , California and New York .\nWhen I was writing my Feb. 5 article , I thought that maybe it was a benign omission that the CDC did not conclude the obvious .\nFor sure , more data would be coming from the CDC in February and March , I thought , as it would teach us so much more about natural immunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materialized .\nSince Jan. 28 , there have been 10 MMWR reports published on the CDC website , totaling 29 articles in all .\nThey cover topics ranging from vaccination by geographic locations , to vaccine confidence by sexual orientation , to isolation strategy for fully vaccinated NFL players , and so on .\nSo far , the Jan. 28 report was the only one that included \u201c unvaccinated , with previous diagnosis \u201d in the data , and that \u2019 s unfortunate .\nAll the other reports were to re-enforce the conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing about natural immunity .\nHere is a screenshot of the MMWR website : For example , one of CDC \u2019 s latest reports , published on Mar .\n18 , includes the following chart : Here , hospitalization data was plotted against 1 ) unvaccinated people , 2 ) vaccinated without a booster , 3 ) vaccinated with a booster .\nThere is no information about people who had recovered from COVID-19 .\nIn other words , information on natural immunity is censored .\nAccording to the CDC \u2019 s own information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 million COVID-19 cases .\nThe vast majority of patients recovered from the disease .\nThis huge part of the U.S. population now enjoys natural immunity .\nThis is also true for Canada and many other parts of the world .\nIt seems that the CDC is avoiding anything and everything related to natural immunity .\nBut why ?\nMaybe the CDC is like Bill Gates , who said at the Munich Security Conference last month : \u201c Sadly , the virus itself , particularly the variant called Omicron , is a type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creates both B-cell and T-cell immunity.\n\u201d What he meant was it would be a sad thing if it is natural immunity , not the vaccines , that defeat COVID-19 .\nLet the CDC and Mr. Gates feel sad .\nThe rest of us are ready to move on with our lives .\nThis article was reprinted with

are often cited by media outlets that are always searching for people to interview for their news stories and programs .\nGovernments also regularly seek counsel from experts on policy decisions or ideas .\nPerhaps nowhere are experts as popular as in the field of health care .\nThis has been especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic , notably when it comes to vaccination .\nIf you happen to have an MD , MPH , PhD or RN at the end of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mainstream narrative on this medical procedure , chances are you qualify as an expert on vaccines .\nOf course , the problem is that most so-called experts on vaccines , in fact , know very little about these pharmaceutical products because the time they \u2019 ve spent studying , writing and engaging on all aspects of the subject can often be measured in days or months , rather than years .\nNote that I \u2019 m excluding specialists such as vaccinologists whose careers focus on the development of vaccines or pediatricians whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pharmacists and other health care providers who also spend a fair amount of time giving shots .\nI \u2019 m also omitting pharmaceutical representatives who sell and market vaccines and advise those who administer , approve and recommend them .\nNeither am I counting public health officials who approve , recommend and fund vaccines based on information provided by representatives of the pharmaceutical companies that develop , produce , sell and market them and scientists and doctors who develop and administer them .\nBeing adept at some of the processes that help make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful and powerful does not necessarily make someone an expert on vaccines .\nAt best , it may make them an expert in one or more narrow areas of the industry , but not someone who has a comprehensive understanding of vaccines and their effects .\nThe reality is that most health care professionals have received practically no formal education on vaccines , and certainly not a well-rounded one .\n\u201c We were told that vaccines are safe and effective , here \u2019 s the schedule , ignore the inserts\u2026 that \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benton , MD .\n\u201c I think in medical school you \u2019 re learning so much that it \u2019 s kind of difficult to learn , that you assumed [ with ] vaccines the science was settled , tried and true .\nSo you just didn \u2019 t question it , that was the easy part\u2026 okay , this is for sure .\nSo you just accept it.\n\u201d 1 James Neuenschwander , MD , who specializes in emergency medicine , said that when he

effects\u2026 at all , \u201d said internist Patricia Ryan , MD .\n\u201c They just wanted you to memorize the schedule and make sure you knew when to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 \u201c The only thing we learned in [ medical ] school was that there was a program and that we should follow that vaccine program , \u201d said pediatrician Ramon Ramos , MD .\nAs to the vaccine itself and the contents of the vaccines , no we didn \u2019 t study that .\nWe assumed that what the pharmaceuticals , that what they did and the CDC accepted , that that \u2019 s the way it is.\n\u201d 1 \u201c We got a lot of microbiology , we learned about diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solution to those diseases that , what they say , are \u2018 vaccine preventable.\n\u2019 But , actually , what was in the vaccines , I don \u2019 t remember really learning anything , \u201d said pediatrician Paul Thomas , MD .\n\u201c I was never taught , when I was in medical school 30 years ago , what was in a vaccine .\nWe were only taught they \u2019 re wonderful.\n\u201d 1 \u201c You \u2019 d be amazed at the number of physicians when you ask them what \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well , there \u2019 s the bacteria , the virus you want to vaccinate against , and then there \u2019 s a little immune stimulant in there to help stimulate the immunity so they react against those viral antigens , \u201d said neurosurgeon Russell Blaylock , MD .\n\u201c They don \u2019 t know about these other chemicals in there like formaldehyde , special proteins , special lipids that are known to be brain toxic , that are known to induce

and , of course , everyone accepted the dogma that vaccines work .\nThere was just no critical analysis about the pros and cons .\nIt was never discussed , let alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s not that I

really what you \u2019 re taught about vaccines .\nYou \u2019 re taught the schedule and that it produces antibodies and that \u2019 s it .\nYou don \u2019 t get any information on innate immunity , and Th1 to Th2 , risks\u2026 none of that.\n\u201d 2 When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught that vaccines were completely safe and completely effective , and I had no reason to believe otherwise .\nAll the information that I was taught was pretty standard in all the medical schools and the teachings and scientific literature throughout the country .\nI had no reason to disbelieve it .\nOver the years , I kept practicing medicine and using vaccines and thinking that my approach to vaccines was completely onboard with everything else I was taught .\nBut more and more , I kept seeing that my experience of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading about vaccines , and hearing what parents were saying about vaccines were very different from what I was taught in medical school and my residency training .\n\u2026 and it became clearer to me as I read the research , listened to more and more parents , and found other practitioners who also shared the same concern that vaccines had not been completely proven safe or even completely effective , based on the literature that we have today .\n\u2026 It didn \u2019 t appear that the scientific studies that we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and test the safety and efficacy .\nIt also came to my attention that there were ingredients in there that were not properly tested , that the comparison groups were not appropriately set up , and that conclusions made about vaccine safety and efficacy just did not fit the scientific standards that I was trained to uphold in my medical school training.2 According to Stephanie Christner , DO , whose infant daughter did not survive vaccination : It is likely that , based on their formal education , all of the health care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on vaccines .\nEarly in their careers , many of these individuals probably thought of themselves as being well-versed on vaccines .\nIt wasn \u2019 t until they began to dig deeper into the history , science and health effects of vaccines and the systems that validate and promote them that they realized the depth of their knowledge gap on the topic .\nIn Malcolm Gladwell \u2019 s book The Outliers : The Story of Success , the author notes a concept popularly known as the \u201c 10,000-hour rule.\n\u201d Gladwell writes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe is the magic number for true expertise : 10,000 hours.\n\u201d In reference to a study by Swedish psychologist Anders Ericsson , Gladwell writes , \u201c their research suggests that once a musician has enough ability to get into a top music school , the thing that distinguishes one performer from another is how hard he or she works .\nThat \u2019 s it.\n\u201d 3 4 5 6 The idea here is that true expertise in any particular field of study or training requires long-term , consistent and dedicated practice .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours is the magic number of greatness.\n\u201d Obviously , this is not a hard and fast rule , and it varies depending on the type of activity or discipline and on the abilities of people and how they practice .\nBut it generally seems like a good gauge .\nBased on Gladwell \u2019 s rule , someone who practices a musical instrument or a sport an average of five hours a day six days a week might expect to achieve a high degree of proficiency within six to seven years.3 4 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other fields , such as vaccines and vaccination policy ( excluding the production and sales sides ) .\nIn that niche area , there are relatively few people who have reached or surpassed Gladwell \u2019 s 10,000-hour milestone .\nAmong these might be health care professionals who discovered that the vaccine paradigm they assumed to be correct contained some glaring holes , inspiring them to invest countless hours re-educating themselves .\nA good example would be pediatrician and author of The Vaccine Book : Making the Right Decision for Your Child Bob Sears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned \u201c very little about vaccines , other than the fact that the FDA and pharmaceutical companies do extensive research on vaccines to make sure they are safe and effective \u201d when he attended Georgetown University School of Medicine.2 Dr. Sears noted : Another good example of a physician who re-educated herself on vaccines is nephrologist Suzanne Humphries , MD , who authored Dissolving Illusions : Disease , Vaccines , and The Forgotten History and Rising From The Dead .\nDr. Humphries said : Probably the best example of a person who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and easily surpassed Gladwell \u2019 s 10,000 hours for achieving true expertise is Barbara Loe Fisher , who is co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center ( NVIC ) , organized in April 1982 and organized as a non-profit charity dedicated to preventing vaccine injuries and deaths through public education under the

illness.\n\u201d 7 8 9 Fisher , who is not a physician or scientist , has been a long-time educator on vaccine safety issues and a human rights activist advocating for informed consent rights with

Trevor N. McFadden of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction , pending further order from the court , to stop the city \u2019 s Minor Consent for Vaccination Act of 2020 ( MCA ) from being implemented by city officials .\nAt least temporarily , doctors will not be allowed to vaccinate children as young as 11 years old without the knowledge or consent of their parents.1 The MCA and the Minor Consent for Vaccination Act Amendment of 2020 permits children 11 years old to \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2019 s ( CDC ) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) without the knowledge of their parents when a doctor believes the child is capable of meeting the informed consent standard .\nUnder the DC law , a doctor is allowed to determine that a minor child is capable of meeting the informed consent standard if the doctort believes the child is \u201c able to comprehend the need for , the nature of , and any significant risks ordinarily inherent in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the child an \u201c age-appropriate \u201d vaccine information statement at the time of vaccination .\nIn order to prevent parents from knowing the vaccination status of their children , the DC law prohibits the insurance company from sending an Explanation of Benefits to the child \u2019 s home .\nIn addition , the vaccine provider must send the shot record directly to the school if the child \u2019 s parents have filed a religious vaccine exemption or the parents have opted their child out of receiving the Human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Booths and the Mazers , separately sued Washington , D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser , alleging that the MCA violated their constitutional and statutory rights and is preempted by federal law .\nThe U.S. District Court issued a single memorandum for both cases , finding that the parents have standing to sue the mayor and have demonstrated a likelihood of succeeding on the merits.5 US District Court Found a Preliminary Injunction is Warranted to Protect DC Children and Parents From Irreparable Harm When considering a preliminary injunction , courts look at four factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requesting party will ultimately succeed on the merits ; ( 2 ) likelihood of irreparable harm should the preliminary injunction not be granted ; ( 3 ) whether a balancing of the equities is in the moving party \u2019 s favor and ( 4 ) consideration of the public \u2019 s interest.6 In this matter , the court determined that all of these factors favored the granting of a preliminary injunction for the plaintiff parents.7 The court determined that parents will likely prevail on their claims that federal law preempts the MCA and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious vaccine exemption for their children , have standing to sue under the Free Exercise Clause because the MCA purposely hides the vaccination status of their children from them but not from parents who did not file a religious exemption .\nThe court further decided that both sets of parents have succeeded in showing that they will suffer irreparable harm should a preliminary injunction not be ordered , and ruled the interest of the public and a balancing of the equities warrants granting a preliminary injunction in favor of the plaintiffs.8 The defendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( b ) ( 6 ) failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted was denied .\nThe court determined that when all the facts alleged by the plaintiff are considered as true and the court \u201c grants plaintiff all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged , \u201d the court can reasonably infer that the Defendant is liable for the alleged misconduct.9 Court Finds Parents Have Standing In Case Challenging DC \u2019 s Minor Consent for Vaccination Law The court determined that the parents have standing because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imminent suffering of an injury , that the injury is related to the defendant , and that a court decision in plaintiff \u2019 s favor will rectify that injury .\nThe court was convinced that one of the Booth \u2019 s children would likely be vaccinated without parental consent under the MCA due to the intense peer-pressure faced by the child that , according to the parents , resulted from a \u201c pressure-cooker environment , enticing and psychologically manipulating [ their minor children ] to defy their parents and take vaccinations against their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further found the Booths had standing because the MCA conflicts with and undermines the protections of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 ( NCVIA ) .\nWhen there is a conflict between a state and a federal law , the federal law takes precedence and preempts or invalidates the state law .\nIn this case , the cause of the imminent injury to the Booth \u2019 s child is implementation of the MCA because the federal NCVIA prohibits doctors and others vaccine providers from giving a child a vaccine without parental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued that , because the MCA treats children attending school with a religious vaccine exemption differently from children attending school without one , the MCA shows \u201c hostility to a religion or religious viewpoint , \u201d which is inconsistent with the First Amendment.11 When considering whether the Mazer parents have standing , the court considered the fact that their daughter , who had wanted to attend a summer camp that required the COVID-19 vaccine , went alone to a doctor seeking the COVID vaccine despite the fact that her parents have a sincerely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filed a religious exemption on her behalf .\nAlthough the daughter informed the doctor of her parent \u2019 s objection and said she only wanted the COVID vaccine in order to attend summer camp , the doctor tried to pressure her into getting three vaccines that day and coached her how to lie to her parents about the shots .\nThe doctor did not give her a Vaccine Information Statement ( VIS ) published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) before vaccination , which is required under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbally informed about any risks of vaccination .\nBefore the doctor could give her the vaccines , she became frightened and left the doctor \u2019 s office.13 The court found that the plaintiffs would likely succeed on their preemption claim because there is a conflict between the MCA and federal law .\nOne of the conflicts between the MCA and the NCVIA lies in the wording of the NCVIA which states that a VIS published by HHS shall be provided to the legal representative \u201c of any child or to any other individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such vaccine.\n\u201c 14 The defendant contends that the wording , \u201c or to any other individual to whom such provider intends to administer such vaccine \u201d could apply to the minor child receiving the vaccine if the child is mature .\nTherefore , the MCA and the NCVIA would not conflict if the child is given an age-appropriate VIS.15 The court disagreed with the defendants finding that the wording of the NCVIA clearly shows that Congress intended for the VIS to be given to a parent or a legal representative of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative of any child \u201d and because they used the word \u201c other \u201d before \u201c individual \u201d .16 The defendants further argued that because the NCVIA did not define what constitutes a \u201c child , \u201d the MCA was free to do so and DC officials could decide that an informed 11-year-old is not a child for the purposes of NCVIA .\nHowever , the court rejected this argument , stating that this interpretation would require the NCVIA to be dependent on state law to define the word \u201c child , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend .\nIf the NCVIA required each state to define the term \u201c child , \u201d it would prevent uniform application of a federal law that was enacted with the intention of creating a federal safety standard for administering vaccines in the U.S.18 Finally , the court found that the defendant \u2019 s interpretation conflicted with the structure and purpose of the NCVIA by bypassing the parents .\nThe court concluded that giving an age-appropriate VIS statement directly to the child , who may not remember past vaccine adverse reactions , prevented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to file a vaccine injury claim with the federal vaccine injury compensation program should the child suffer a severe vaccine reaction causing injury or death .\nSince parents or legal guardians are the only ones permitted to file a vaccine injury compensation claim , the court found that leaving parents in the dark as to their child \u2019 s vaccination status so they are unable to file a timely vaccine injury compensation claim is a fatal flaw .\nThe court concluded that the DC minor consent law deviates from congressional intent when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The court had concerns with the MCA encouraging children to deceive their parents and questioned what the child would do if they had an adverse reaction concluding\u2026 The court rejected the defendant \u2019 s argument that because states allowed children to consent to medical procedures at the time the NCVIA was enacted , Congress did not intend to preempt all of these laws .\nThe court pointed out , however , that while minors may have bene able to consent to certain medical procedures , they were not allowed to consent to vaccination.23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution provides , \u201c Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\n\u201d 24 The court sided with the plaintiffs stating that the MCA is not neutral and not generally applicable because it requires health care providers to leave part 3 of the Certificate blank for minors who have a religious vaccine exemption but are required to fill this part out for minors without a religious exemption .\nTherefore , minors with a religious vaccine exemption are singled out and treated differently due to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targets religion , a strict scrutiny analysis is applicable .\nWith strict scrutiny , the government is required to show that the burden on religion is , \u201c justified by a compelling governmental interest and [ is ] narrowly tailored to advance that interest.\n\u201d 25 The court found the defendant \u2019 s interest in preventing the spread of communicable diseases through vaccination compelling .\nHowever , the court stated there was no reason put forth to explain why medical and religious exemptions to vaccination are treated differently by the MCA and concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe court left open the possibility that the defendants could survive a strict scrutiny analysis at the next hearing but , at this point , the court said they have failed to meet their burden .\nThe court easily concluded that the Booth parents would suffer irreparable injury absent injunctive relief because of the violation to their First Amendment rights and that both parents will suffer irreparable injury without injunctive relief because they both proved that their children would likely get the vaccine under the MCA , and that receipt of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , the court found that a balancing of the equities and public interest favor granting relief .\nImplementation of Washington , DC \u2019 s MCA will be temporarily halted pending the outcome of the

in The Epoch Times , the Donaldsons pointed out that the hospital \u2019 s policy allows the kidneys of unvaccinated deceased donors to be used for kidney transplants but turns away unvaccinated live kidney donors .\nCommenting on the contradiction , Dane Donaldson said : Despite the Donaldson \u2019 s offer to sign a liability waiver protecting the clinic should he or Tanner come down with COVID post-transplant , the clinic continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tanner , maintaining that : The Informed Consent Action Network ( ICAN ) sent a letter to the Cleveland Clinic listing a number of studies showing that it is rare for a person to be reinfected with COVID after recovering from the SARS-CoV-2 virus , which included a study published by the clinic itself .\nIn that study looking at 52,238 vaccinated and unvaccinated health care workers , not one of the previously infected unvaccinated health care workers were reinfected with the virus over a five-month period.10 In an ABC-TV report , Dane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his young son\u2026 I don \u2019 t know what we do today .\nYou know , I got ta think somewhere out there , that cooler heads would prevail and we could , you know , I \u2019 d love

Biden administration allowing the U.S. Navy to consider the COVID-19 vaccination status of military personnel when making deployment decisions .\nThe 6-3 decision overrides a lower U.S. district court decision that had temporarily prevented the Navy from treating deployment of Navy Seals with religious vaccine exemptions differently from those without religious exemptions.1 In 2021 , the Department of Defense ( DoD ) mandated that all members of the military receive the COVID vaccine by mid-December .\nA group of 35 Navy Seals filed a federal lawsuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filed a religious exemption to the vaccination requirement , which they argued is a violation of the Free Exercise of Religion Clause of the U.S. Constitution and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act .\nTexas Court Had Temporarily Blocked Navy from Punishing Seals with Religious Vaccine Exemptions On Jan. 3 , 2022 , Judge Reed O \u2019 Connor for the Northern District of Texas Fort Worth granted a preliminary injunction

Connor stated : The U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Judge O \u2019 Connor \u2019 s injunction .\nThis prompted the Biden administration to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court for a review and request that the nation \u2019 s highest court partially reverse the preliminary injunction , which was granted.3 4 The Supreme Court ruling allows the Navy to consider the vaccination status of Seals when making deployment , assignment and other operational decisions while the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals further considers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filing a religious vaccine exemption should be subject to discipline and discharge from the service .\nThe Court \u2019 s narrow decision is limited only to the Navy considering vaccination status in deciding assignments and deployments , while the temporary prohibition on disciplining or discharging Seals who file a religious exemption remains in place.5 Since the controversial COVID vaccine was mandated for the Navy , there have been approximately 4,000 requests for religious exemptions but , as of February 2022 , only 80 requests have been adjudicated and only one religious vaccine exemption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy Seals argue that the Navy is using the personnel assignment process as punishment for Seals , whose religious beliefs prevent them from getting the COVID vaccine .\nSeals applying for a religious vaccine exemption are disqualified from specialized assignments and missions , while Seals , who are not vaccinated for medical or administrative reasons , are still eligible.7 One Justice Cited the U.S. Constitution

clear contrast to public opinion prior to the coronavirus pandemic when a 2019 poll showed that more than 80 percent of Americans viewed the CDC favorably.4 5 Rep. Larry Bucshon ( R-Ind ) , a heart surgeon and member of the Republican Doctor Caucus , believes the problem is that the public views the CDC as a political tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains that trust in the CDC has eroded partially due to studies showing that the lockdowns the CDC recommended did not have a significant impact on stopping the transmission of COVID .\nHe points to a Johns Hopkins University study that showed the lockdowns had little to no effect on COVID death rates .\nHe also suggests that the agency should consider levels of natural immunity rather than just focusing on raising vaccination levels as a way to control of the virus , but , so far , the CDC has failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 8 billion in FY2020 and FY2021 for the CDC to do its job,8 executive director of the American Public Health Association ( APHA ) George Benjamin , MD believes the problems with the CDC \u2019 s poor public image are due to inadequate funding .\nDr. Benjamin said that by more money would solve the agency \u2019 s problems because federal health officials would be able to develop a more accurate data infrastructure , boost the workforce , strengthen lab capacity and improve rapid-response systems , which would increase the agency \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Organizational Skills of CDC Employees According to Terry Haines , founder of the health care consultancy Pangaea Policy , the CDC is facing two major problems that can only be remedied by having an outside expert conduct a review of the agency .\nHe said : Texas based cardiologist , Fahmi J.

\u201c low \u201d considering hospital admissions are also considered low while the old guidelines called 50 cases or more per 100,000 people , \u201c substantial or high.\n\u201d Seemingly overnight

Is CDC Following the Science or Playing Politics ?\nThe CDC insists that their policies are based purely on scientific decisions , but some of the actions the agency has taken during the past two years has raised questions about whether all of its decisions are only based on the scientific evidence .\nAt the start of the pandemic , the agency said that COVID was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masks were not necessary .\nWhen the CDC reversed that decision and told Americans they all must wear masks , public health officials claimed that the science had evolved when , in reality , although scientific knowledge about the risks of transmitting the virus may have advanced , the CDC \u2019 s initial assertion was also largely based on the shortage of mask supplies for healthcare workers .\nCritics say the agency should have been more honest and transparent with the public about reasons for masking ( or not masking ) .14 When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 days to five days , public health officials said this change was , \u201c motivated by science.\n\u201d However , after studies showed that as many as half of COVID-19 patients are still contagious five days into the infection , the agency admitted that the change in guidance was also influenced by other factors , such as economic effects and compliance issues associated with a longer quarantine .\nWhether or not this was a sound decision taking into consideration all factors , it appears the change in the CDC \u2019 s quarantine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported by scientific evidence .\nThis lack of transparency has contributed to public mistrust of the agency.15 According to Mical Raz , MD , professor of history and health policy at the University of Rochester , \u201c Many opportunities to regain trust were squandered , perhaps in this attempt to

in every case which we are aware of , determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were hopeful , for earlier this year multiple federal courts on religious grounds enjoined the DoD from forcing COVID vaccinations on military personnel , most notably the Navy SEALs .\nHowever , this week the Supreme Court issued a temporary stay , allowing the Navy to reassign the SEALs at its discretion .\nSubsequently , a federal judge in Texas certified a lawsuit as a class action and issued a preliminary injunction protecting approximately 4,000 sailors seeking religious exemptions .\nUntil the final opinions are rendered , it remains to be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enact other punishments .\nAll the cadets facing dismissal are in prime health and without medical comorbidities , which greatly reduces the chances of becoming severely ill. Their vaccine status has not affected their ability to perform all required duties .\nA number of them have been infected with COVID , suffered only mild symptoms , and achieved antibody-proven

@ @ @ @ @ vaccine that does not prevent infection nor stop its transmission , and the evidence that despite high vaccination rates , Germany , Italy , and the United Kingdom have experienced a surge

protection .\nThey cited over 150 studies from multiple institutions , including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , that validate their argument .\nThis immunity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B \u201d and \u201c T \u201d cell mediated protection .\nThey understand that if there is any benefit to vaccinating young adults , it wanes over a few months .\nThe vaccine \u2019 s efficacy in averting hospitalization and death , the rationale the academy administration employs to justify mandatory vaccination , applies to the geriatric population , but not young adults who face one-thousandth the risk .\nTheirs is a straightforward request : Judge us by whether we have or not have immunity , not by our vaccination status .\nThe cadets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigid vaccine policy is that it is inconsistent with the manner in which religious and medical exemptions are enforced regarding other diseases .\nCurrently , 44 states and the District of Columbia allow religious exemptions for childhood vaccinations .\nThe CDC recognizes natural immunity in lieu of vaccinations in cases of previous infection with measles and chickenpox .\nThose who have attended a United States military academy understand the rigid hierarchy that pervades these institutions .\nFrom the rank of four-star generals to the fourth class cadet , the lines between authority and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure , indispensable in the military setting , when left unchecked , can readily intimidate and punish those who legitimately question this authority for religious or medical reasons .\nMilitary physicians , who are under orders to administer COVID vaccines to all cadets irrespective of the circumstances , may not provide their patients with an accurate risk-benefit assessment and information required for proper informed consent .\nProper informed consent includes the risks and benefits of the procedure but also alternatives and their attendant risks and benefits .\nDuring the process the AMA proscribes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge or consent .\nTo do so is ethically unacceptable .\nIn structured environments , where patients are vulnerable and lack autonomy , the right to informed consent is based on accurate , untainted information and can not be abridged .\nThe courts have ruled that informed consent is binding only in the absence of fraud .\nAccording to the FDA , recipients of a vaccine administered under an Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) must have the option to accept or refuse the vaccine and any other available alternative .\nUnder the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a requirement with the exception of a few extenuating circumstances .\nThe Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine formulation , which is authorized under the EUA , is currently the only product administered to members of the armed forces .\nComirnaty is the only FDA-approved vaccine , but it is not available in the United States .\nThe cadets have multiple reasons for concern about vaccine safety .\nIn August 2021 Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced mandatory COVID vaccination for all military personnel .\nAt that time it was well known that the severe effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the healthy military age cohort , and also well known was the presence of a disturbing number and variety of serious , adverse vaccine side effects reported in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) .\nThese trends continued with greater public awareness of the ability of mRNA vaccines to cause myocarditis in young men , which in some cases is irreversible .\nIn the military setting both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines expose patients to a higher risk of contracting myocarditis than the disease .\nThis past year 500 exceptionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died of cardiac arrest during strenuous competition .\nThis compares with a 38-year period ending in 2006 that averaged 29 deaths per year , which primarily were due to congenital heart disease in similar patient populations .\nCadets express concerns that government agencies have either failed to report or altered epidemiological information related to COVID .\nThe New York Times recently reported that the CDC is not reporting large amounts of data it collects , and this month the agency removed over 72,000 deaths that it had falsely attributed to COVID .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fraud regarding the Defense Medical Epidemiology Database ( DMED ) , which links the diagnoses of all 1.4 million active duty military personnel to a unique code , became evident in Senate testimony two months ago .\nAll DMED data is entered by healthcare professionals , and there is no monetary incentive to influence the procedure .\nThe altered epidemiological data is confounding and raises concerns about its accuracy and effect on the informed consent process .\nExcessive care is deficient care , especially when fraud is involved , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health care fraud occurs when an individual , group , or organization misrepresents or misstates the type , scope , or the nature of the medical treatment or service provided .\nFor a procedure to be defined as a medical necessity it must be reasonably expected to meet at least one of four criteria : prevent disease , cure or reduce physical effects of the illness , reduce pain and suffering caused by the illness , or assist one to achieve maximum capacity in performing activities of daily living .\nIt is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attending the Air Force Academy , who at worst would be expected to experience mild flu-like symptoms from the current COVID variant .\nIn view of the sincerity of the cadets \u2019 religious objections and the adverse risk-to-benefit profile of receiving the COVID vaccine , what is the purpose of forcing these cadets to subject themselves to a procedure that affords them and

Vaccine Mandate for Federal Workers Reinstated by Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals", "content": "On Apr .\n7 , 2022 , the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans , Louisiana ruled that the Biden administration \u2019 s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for all Federal workers must be reinstated .\nThe 2-1 ruling reversed a lower court order blocking the vaccine mandate for federal workers .\nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Carl Stewart ordered the lower court to dismiss the case.1 In September 2021 , the Biden administration announced that all federal workers were required to receive the COVID vaccine .\nAlthough medical and religious exemptions were permitted , non-exempt federal employees could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and termination if they did not comply and receive the controversial vaccine .\nFeds for Medical Freedom , a group of 6,000 members , challenged the mandate and sued the Biden administration .\nOn Jan. 21 , Judge Jeffrey Brown of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas sided with the plaintiffs and effectively placed the COVID vaccine mandate for federal workers on hold .\nThe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling means that the U.S. government successfully appealed the decision.2 3 Court of Appeals Ruled Federal Judges Do Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Appeals found that the lower court decisions fail because a federal judge does not have jurisdiction over federal employees challenging the vaccine mandate and redress is found exclusively under Civil Service Law.4 The court agreed with the government \u2019 s position that the federal employees , by filing this federal lawsuit , were circumventing the Civil Service Reform Act ( CSRA ) , which was implemented to protect employees from unfair or unwanted practices.5 The CSRA prevents federal employees from filing a lawsuit prior to facing discipline for challenging a federal employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken , federal employees looking to appeal must file an appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board prior to filing an action with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit .\nThe Court said that if the Plaintiffs wanted to take pre-enforcement action , they could have filed a complaint with the Office of the Special Counsel and argued that personnel practices precluded a COVID vaccine mandate.6 Concluding that the CSRA precluded the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction and invalidated the preliminary injunction , the Court stated : Administration Argued President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEOs Have Over Corporate Employees The Biden administration argued that the U.S. Constitution grants the President the same authority over the federal workforce that a CEO has over a private corporation .\nThe plaintiffs argued that the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling , which prevents the federal government from forcing private employers to require that their employees to get the COVID vaccine , precludes President Biden from ordering all federal workers to get the vaccine.10 Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Rhesa Hawkins Barksdale , who wrote a dissenting opinion , disagreed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) requiring all federal employees to receive the COVID vaccine falls within the purview of the CSRA .\nShe said the case was appropriately adjudicated by the U.S. District Court .\nIn her dissent , she stated that the EO is not subject to the CSRA , in part , because the CSRA applies to federal employees , \u201c facing proposed actions by an employing agency \u201d and not a sweeping mandate by the President , which is the current case .\nFurther , she pointed out that the CSFA applies to individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire classes of people who are required to receive a vaccine or be subject to adverse action like in the present case.11 Judge Hawkins Barksdale wrote : The EO \u2019 s enactment , however , does not constitute an adverse action subject to CSRA .\nThe case at hand is instead a pre-enforcement challenge to a government-wide policy , imposed by the President , that would affect the 2.1 million federal civilian workers , including the 6,000 members of Feds for Medical Freedom .\nRelief plaintiffs seek does not fall within the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then requiring federal civilian employees who may later receive adverse action to seek relief now through CSRA would result in the very type of lengthy and haphazard results CSRA was enacted to prevent.12 > The two judges signing the majority opinion , Judge Stewart and Judge James Dennis , were appointed by President Bill Clinton .\nDissenting Judge Hawkens Barksdale was

striking image served as a potent symbol for totalitarianism in the 20th Century .\nBut as Caylan Ford recently observed , with the advent of digital health passports in the emerging biomedical security state , the new symbol of totalitarian repression is \u201c not a boot , but an algorithm in the cloud : emotionless , impervious to appeal , silently shaping the biomass.\n\u201d The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real for being virtual rather than physical .\nThese new digital surveillance and control mechanisms will be no less oppressive for being virtual rather than physical .\nContact tracing apps , for example , have proliferated with at least 120 different apps in used in 71 different states , and 60 other digital contact-tracing measures have been used across 38 countries .\nThere is currently no evidence that contact tracing apps or other methods of digital surveillance have helped to slow the spread of COVID ; but as with so many of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have deterred their use .\nOther advanced technologies were deployed in what one writer has called , with a nod to Orwell , \u201c the stomp reflex , \u201d to describe governments \u2019 propensity to abuse emergency powers .\nTwenty-two countries used surveillance drones to monitor their populations for COVID rule-breakers , others deployed facial recognition technologies , twenty-eight countries used internet censorship and thirteen countries resorted to internet shutdowns to manage populations during COVID .\nA total of 32 countries have used militaries or military ordnances to enforce rules , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , police shot and killed several citizens while imposing a lockdown .\nOrwell explored the power of language to shape our thinking , including the power of sloppy or degraded language to distort thought .\nHe articulated these concerns not only in his novels Animal Farm and 1984 but in his classic essay , \u201c Politics and the English Language , \u201d where he argues that \u201c if thought corrupts language , language can also corrupt thought.\n\u201d The totalitarian regime depicted in 1984 requires citizens to communicate in Newspeak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and restricted vocabulary designed to limit the individual \u2019 s ability to think or articulate subversive concepts such as personal identity , self-expression , and free will .\nWith this bastardization of language , complete thoughts are reduced to simple terms conveying only simplistic meaning .\nNewspeak eliminates the possibility of nuance , rendering impossible consideration and communication of shades of meaning .\nThe Party also intends with Newspeak \u2019 s short words to make speech physically automatic and thereby make speech largely unconscious , which further diminishes the possibility of genuinely critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syme discusses his editorial work on the latest edition of the Newspeak Dictionary : By 2050\u2014earlier , probably\u2014all real

.\nHow could you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of freedom has been abolished ?\nThe whole climate of thought will be different .\nIn fact , there will be no thought , as we understand it now .\nOrthodoxy means not thinking\u2014not needing to think .\nOrthodoxy is unconsciousness .\nSeveral terms of disparagement were repeatedly deployed during the pandemic , phrases whose only function was to halt the possibility of critical thought .\nThese included , among others , \u2018 COVID denier , \u2019 \u2018 anti-vax , \u2019 and \u2018 conspiracy theorist \u2019 .\nSome commentators will doubtless mischaracterize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using these and similar terms\u2014ready-made shortcuts that save critics the trouble of reading the book or critically engaging my evidence or arguments .\nA brief comment on each of these may be helpful in illustrating how they function .\nThe first term , \u2018 COVID denier , \u2019 requires little attention .\nThose who sling this charge at any critic of our pandemic response recklessly equate COVID with the Holocaust , which suggests that antisemitism continues to infect discourse on both the right and the left .\nWe need not detain ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The epithet \u2018 anti-vax , \u2019 deployed to characterize anyone who raises questions about the mass vaccination campaign or the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines , functions similarly as a conversation stopper rather than an accurately descriptive label .\nWhen people ask me whether I am anti-vax for challenging vaccine mandates I can only respond that the question makes about as much sense to me as the question , \u201c Dr .\nKheriaty , are you \u2018 pro-medication \u2019 or \u2018 anti-medication \u2019 ?\n\u201d The answer is obviously contingent and nuanced @ @ @

everyone in every circumstance and all the time .\nRegarding the term \u201c conspiracy theorist , \u201d Agamben notes that its indiscriminate deployment \u201c demonstrates a surprising historical ignorance.\n\u201d For anyone familiar with history knows that the stories historians recount retrace and reconstruct the actions of individuals , groups , and factions working in common purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means .\nHe mentions three examples from among thousands in the historical record .\nIn 415 BC Alcibiades deployed his influence and money to convince the Athenians to embark on an expedition to Sicily , a venture that turned out disastrously and marked the end of Athenian supremacy .\nIn retaliation , Alcibiades enemies hired false witnesses and conspired against him to condemn him to death .\nIn 1799 Napoleon Bonaparte violated his oath of fidelity to the Republic \u2019 s Constitution , overthrowing the directory in a coup , assumed full powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior , he had met with co-conspirators to fine-tune their strategy against the anticipated opposition of the Council of Five Hundred .\nCloser to our own day , he mentions the March on Rome by 25,000 Italian fascists in October 1922 .\nLeading up to this even , Mussolini prepared the march with three collaborators , initiated contacts with the Prime Minister and powerful figures from the business world ( some even maintain that Mussolini secretly met with the King to explore possible allegiances ) .\nThe fascists rehearsed their occupation of Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months prior .\nCountless other examples , from the murder of Julius Caesar to the Bolshevik revolution , will occur to any student of history .\nIn all these cases , individuals gathering in groups or parties to strategize goals and tactics , anticipate obstacles , then act resolutely to achieve their aims .\nAgamben acknowledges that this does not mean it is always necessary to aver to \u2018 conspiracies \u2019 to explain historical events .\n\u201c But anyone who labelled a historical who tried to reconstruct in detail the plots that triggered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 would most definitely be demonstrating their own ignorance , if

Klaus Schwab published a book in 2020 laying out the WEF agenda with the helpful title , Covid-19 : The Great Reset .\nFollowing new revelations about the lab leak hypothesis , U.S. funding of

and Human Services ( HHS ) , signed a contract with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallpox and monkeypox vaccine.4 A freeze-dried version of the vaccine is stated to have a longer shelf life.5 BARDA placed an $ 119 million order for 13 million freeze-dried doses of Bavarian Nordic \u2019 s smallpox and monkeypox vaccine known as JYNNEOS\u00ae .\nThe contract states that the U.S. has an option to purchase additional vaccines worth $ 180 million if needed.6 Monkeypox is a rare viral , zoonotic infectious disease that typically manifests with a fever , skin rashes , swollen lymph nodes , muscle and body

monkeypox virus occurs through close contact with an infected person or animal or with material contaminated with the virus .\nPerson to person transmission occurs through close contact with open skin lesions , body fluids , respiratory droplets and contaminated materials , such as bedding .\nAccording to the WHO , monkeypox is not as contagious as smallpox and usually causes less severe illness.8 On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approved a live , non-replicating JYNNEOS\u00ae smallpox and monkeypox vaccine in adults 18 years of age and older determined to be at high risk

Federal Judge", "date": "2022-05-24", "source": "thevaccinereaction", "title": "Mask Mandate for U.S. Public Transportation Struck Down by Federal Judge", "content": "On Apr .\n18 , 2022 , U.S. District Court Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle in the Middle District of Florida struck down the Biden administration \u2019 s mask mandate for people traveling on U.S. public transportation , including planes , trains and buses.1 After the ruling , the U.S. Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) confirmed that it will no longer enforce the mask mandate nationwide .\nThis announcement left the airports , airlines and other transportation agencies to decide for themselves whether they will enforce a mask mandate .\nMost airlines and other transportation agencies including United , American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JetBlue , Alaska Airlines , Amtrak , Uber and Lyft changed their policy to make masks optional for travelers.2 Immediately before the ruling , U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) officials had extended the mask mandate until May 3.3 In this case , the plaintiffs\u2014Health Freedom Defense Fund , Sarah Pope and Ana Dazza\u2014sued the government by alleging that the mask mandate violated the Administrative Procedure Act ( APA ) .\nBoth parties quickly filed a motion for Summary Judgment .\nA Motion for Summary Judgment asks the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial or even before pre-trial preparation begins that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law when there are no material facts in dispute.4 The plaintiffs alleged ( 1 ) that the mask mandate exceeded the CDC \u2019 s authority ; ( 2 ) that Congress improperly delegated its legislative power to the CDC ; ( 3 ) the notice and comment period was improperly bypassed when the mask mandate went into effect and ( 4 ) The mask mandate is arbitrary and capricious and , therefore , in violation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2021 , the CDC ignored the APA \u2019 s 30-day notice and comment period and issued the mask mandate requiring that \u201c a person must wear a mask while boarding , disembarking , and traveling on any conveyance into or within the United States.\n\u201d The mask mandate had some exemptions , namely children under two years old and those who have an ADA recognized disability .\nIn addition , all passengers were allowed to remove masks when eating or drinking .\nTransportation operators were required to police and enforce the mandate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the premises and filing for criminal penalties.6 For the authority to issue the mask mandate , the CDC relied on the Public Health Services Act of 1944 ( PHSA ) which allows the CDC to \u201c promulgate regulations aimed at identifying , isolating and destroying diseases.\n\u201d The PHSA allows the CDC limited power to detain , examine or provide conditions for a person entering the US or traveling between states when the CDC reasonably believes is infected with a communicable disease .\nWhile the PHSA was rarely invoked in the past and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CDC has relied on it to justify a number of regulations since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 .\nTwo of the regulations that relied on the PHSA \u2013 not allowing cruise ship travel and the eviction moratorium \u2013 have been struck down by the courts for exceeding the scope of the PHSA.7 In this case , the court analyzed the plain language in Section 264 ( a ) of the PHSA and found that , although the first sentence grants the CDC broad authority to use its judgment when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second sentence greatly limits this authority .\nThe second sentence narrows the scope of the CDC \u2019 s power and scope of making regulations to \u201c inspection , fumigation , disinfection , sanitation , pest extermination , and destruction of contaminated animals and articles and other measures.\n\u201d Mandating that travelers wear a mask is not included in this list .\nThe government argued that wearing a mask falls under \u201c sanitation \u201d or \u201c other measures.\n\u201d The court disagreed and , after conducting a detailed analysis , concluded that because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cleaning , which is something a mask can not do , the mask mandate falls outside the scope of the PHSA.8 The historical use of the PHSA also does not support the current justification of the mask mandate .\nThe statute allows the federal government to inspect and quarantine an item or person at a \u201c major port of entry \u201d in order to assist the state \u2019 s public health measures .\nHistorically , under their police powers , states have had the right to enact public health measures and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist the states in these efforts.9 Therefore , the court found that the federal government exceeded its power under the PHSA : The court determined that , while \u00a7264 ( a ) allows the CDC to directly impose on an individual \u2019 s property interests , it does not give the CDC the right to impose on an individual \u2019 s liberty interests by mandating mask wearing .\nThis is because individuals who are not wearing masks are forcibly removed from transportation .\nTherefore , the court considered the mandate a form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are covered in \u00a7264 ( a ) .11 By allowing individuals who may be infected with COVID-19 and could potentially spread the virus to travel with a mask , the court views the mask mandate as a \u201c conditional release , \u201d despite fears the individual could spread the virus .\nHowever , the detention of and the conditional release of individuals is limited to international travelers under \u00a7264 ( c ) and only applies under \u00a7264 ( d ) between the states when an individual is \u201c reasonably believed to be infected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination .\nWhile the mask mandate applies to all travelers traveling internationally and between states , there is no examination to determine who may be harboring the virus .\nTherefore , the mask mandate exceeds the authority granted to the CDC in \u00a7264 subsections a through d.12 The CDC Unlawfully Bypassed the Notice and Comment Period The court took issue with the CDC bypassing the 30-day minimum notice and comment period before enacting the mask mandate .\nThe two exceptions to the notice and comment period that are applicable to the present case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rule and when the agency had good cause to skip the notice and comment period .\nThe court quickly dismissed the government \u2019 s initial argument that the mask mandate was not a rule , leaving the question as to whether the CDC had good cause to bypass the notice and comment period.13 The standard to determine whether an agency \u2019 s action falls under the good cause exemption is whether the government can show that the 30-day notice and comment period was \u201c impracticable , unnecessary , or contrary to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule must set forth in the rule itself a brief statement of their findings and reasoning as to why the rule should be enforced without the required notice and comment period.14 Judge Mizelle found that this one sentence explanation did not satisfy the agency \u2019 s burden to state their findings and reasoning behind invoking the good cause exception .\nSimply stating that the rule is necessary and in the public \u2019 s interest is not enough to invoke the good cause exception .\nInstead , specific detailed reasons why the notice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rely on the good cause exception .\nThe CDC \u2019 s reasoning that the mask mandate needed to go into effect immediately did not hold much weight with the court as the agency waited about a year into the pandemic to issue the rule.16 The Rule of Prejudicial Error Can not Save the Mask Mandate The Rule of Prejudicial Error ( \u201c The Rule \u201d ) provides that courts should only set aside an agency action in cases where that error was harmful .\nHowever , the rule is not applicable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the error \u201c had no bearing on the procedure used or the substance of the decision reached.\n\u201d 17 The court finding that the agency \u2019 s omission of the notice and comment period affected the \u201c procedure used , \u201d together with the fact that public comment would not have been inconsequential considering the mask mandate directly regulates individual \u2019 s behavior , rendered the agency \u2019 s error of bypassing the notice and comment period harmful.18 Federal agencies have a duty to engage in reasoned \u201c decision making \u201d and laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoned decision making will be set aside by courts for bring arbitrary and capricious .\nIt is the agencies responsibility to look at relevant data and explain a \u201c a rational connection between the facts found and the choices made \u201d and the agency \u201c must consider and explain its rejection of \u201c reasonably obvious \u201d or \u201c significant and viable \u201d alternatives.\n\u201d 19 Judge Mizelle concluded that the mask mandate failed the reasoned-explanation standard because ( 1 ) the CDC does not explain why it rejected alternatives to masking ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mask to suffice whether home-made or medical grade ; and ( 3 ) there is no good explanation for the basis that exceptions to the mask mandate are granted .\nAt issue are the numerous exceptions the CDC allows to the mask mandate , such as children under the age of two , and people who experience difficulty breathing or have an ADA recognized disability , and the fact that masks may be removed when eating or drinking without providing an explanation as to why these exemptions exist and why those exemptions don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mask mandate in the first place.20 For the above reasons , the court vacated the mask mandate for exceeding the APA \u2019 s authority and made it applicable to the entire country .\nThe government has already appealed the decision per the CDC \u2019 s request.23 The government \u2019 s decision to appeal the lower court order repealing mask mandates comes as a surprise since many public transportation systems and airlines have changed their policy to make masks optional for travelers .\nThe fact that the government didn \u2019 t ask for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mask mandate gives the impression that the CDC is prolonging this battle to establish the CDC \u2019 s authority to issue mandates in the future , rather than fighting the current order repealing the mask mandate.25 The Flight Attendants Union , which has taken a neutral stand on the issue , promoted a calm and consistent reaction to the ruling stating : Airlines for America , a trade association for a number of airlines was encouraged by the ruling and said : Scott Kirby , CEO of United Airlines cautioned that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to come back anytime in the foreseeable future.\n\u201d 28 On May 3 , the CDC reinstated their recommendation that all travelers wear masks and that public transportation operators support mask wearing by travelers and employees.29 The 11th circuit Court of Appeals that will be hearing the appeal covers the entire Southeast .\nTherefore , a decision by the court would be binding on a large part of the country .\nA failed appeal to the Supreme Court would make the Florida court \u2019 s decision applicable to the entire country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to make such mandates in the future in the future.30 Professor Gostin is a longtime proponent of mandatory vaccination and the architect of the Model State

brought suit in the Supreme Court of India against the Union of India and COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers in a legal challenge to the country \u2019 s COVID vaccine program.1 Dr. Puliyel , who has served as Director of Research and Projects at Holy Family Hospital in Delhi and is a former member of the National Technical Advisory Group ( NTAG ) on immunizations in India , sued the government and COVID vaccine manufacturers seeking release of information related to the COVID vaccine approval process , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change that allows unvaccinated persons to enter public spaces and access resources .\nSpecifically , Dr. Puliyel asked the Supreme Court of India for the release of each phase of clinical trial data for the COVID vaccines administered in India ; disclosure of minutes from the meeting of the Subject Expert Committee and the NTGAI with regard to vaccines ; release of information surrounding the approval or rejection of emergency use applications of vaccines by the Drugs Controller General of India ( DCGI ) ; and disclosure of post vaccination data related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to declare that all COVID vaccine mandates are unconstitutional and a violation of h2citizen \u2019 s rights .\nDr. Puliyel : COVID Vaccines Do Not Prevent Infection or Transmission In support of his request , Dr. Puliyel submitted affidavits to the court stating that natural immunity from SARS-CoV-2 is superior to vaccine acquired immunity and that vaccines do not prevent infection or transmission of COVID .\nNews articles were submitted to show that two-thirds of the population in India had already been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have antibodies to the virus , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infections .\nDr. Puliyel also argued that vaccine mandates and restrictions on the unvaccinated are meaningless because the virus is transmitted by the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike .\nThe government maintained that the COVID vaccines administered in India , Covaxin and Covishield , are needed to combat the global pandemic threat .\nThey also maintained that trial data can not be released to the public due to privacy concerns ; that information regarding adverse events has already been released ; that vaccination remains voluntary for all citizens , and that restrictions on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health .\nRespondent COVID vaccine manufacturers argued that they followed strict guidelines for government approval of their COVID vaccines .\nThe Union of India strongly opposed this lawsuit , claiming that the publicity could increase vaccine hesitancy and endanger the public health , and that public health matters should not be interfered with by the court .\nHowever , because Dr. Puliyel brought this lawsuit in the interest of the public and because he is considered a subject matter expert , the Court determined the case would be heard for the welfare of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India Looked to High Courts in Other Countries The government made their argument relying on prominent cases in India , as well as U.S. cases , such as Jacobson v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts , Zucht v. King ; Biden vs. Missouri , and Roman Catholic Diocese v. Cuomo .\nThe court also looked to New South Wales for guidance , finding that the Supreme Court in Assam v. Hazzard held that it was not the court \u2019 s role to determine the effectiveness of the government \u2019 s regulations or whether the regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID posed to the public , instead the New South Whales Supreme Court emphasized that their only role was to determine the legal validity of the Minister \u2019 s orders .\nReviewing India \u2019 s case history , the Court summarized its role in reviewing policy decisions : In considering the global pandemic , the court said that it could not find fault with the government \u2019 s vaccination drive , citing the highly transmissible Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 ; the approximate loss of 5,23,843 lives from the virus in India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Organization ( WHO ) , TAG-CO-VAC and SAGE that vaccination would provide strong protection against serious illness , hospitalization and death .\nHowever , regarding the issue of the right of individual privacy verses the government restricting individual rights in the name of public health , the Supreme Court of India found that forced vaccination is a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India .\nThe Court previously found in Article 21 a right to personal autonomy , which extends to the right to refuse medical treatment .\nIn balancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health and an individual \u2019 s right to personal autonomy , the court found that Article 21 of the Indian Constitution grants individuals the right to determine how they should live their own life , which includes the right to refuse medical treatment such as vaccination .\nHowever , when there is a likelihood that an individual could spread the virus to other people , the state \u2019 s interest in protecting the public allows the government to impose certain restrictions on individual rights , as long as such restrictions are reasonable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reviewable by the courts .\nAccordingly , the Court found that the government \u2019 s restrictions are a valid exercise of power , despite evidence that an unvaccinated person is no more likely to spread the Delta or Omicron variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus than a vaccinated person .\nThe Court : COVID Vaccination Policy in India Not Unreasonable In support of his case , Dr. Puliyel presented scientific journals showing that patients who recovered from COVID still had antibodies 11 months after infection .\nHe also pointed out that countries with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a higher rate of COVID per one million people .\nHe said that a vaccine surveillance report in the United Kingdom showed that , in week 40 , there was a negative efficacy of the vaccine in those over the age of 30 .\nThe court confirmed that its only role is to determine whether the Union of India took into consideration scientific research when establishing its policy advocating COVID vaccination for the entire country .\nThe court acknowledged that large portions of the public can not be considered healthy because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutrition , especially the elderly population , and that the Union of India \u2019 s vaccination policy was rightly centered around large segments of more vulnerable people , rather than a minority who are healthy .\nAccordingly , the court found that the COVID vaccination policy of India was made in the interest of public health and is not unreasonable .\nConsidering the fact that the vaccinated and the unvaccinated pose nearly the same risk of transmitting the virus , the court looked at whether the Union of India \u2019 s vaccination policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources amounted to discrimination .\nDr. Puliyel presented a letter published in the Lancet finding that peak viral load of COVID did not differ either by vaccination status or by variant ; that the secondary infection rate of vaccinated and unvaccinated households only differed by two percent , and that four of the five most vaccinated countries were categorized by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) as high transmission countries .\nIn addition , he submitted a study conducted in Massachusetts in July 2021 demonstrating that , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 469 COVID cases ( 74 percent ) were among vaccinated persons .\nPresented with this data , the court concluded : The court suggested that all authorities , public , private and educational , review their current orders that restrict an unvaccinated person \u2019 s access to public services and resources .\nThe Court : Government Followed Approval Process for COVID Vaccines Dr. Puliyel asserted that

Johnson/Janssen \u2019 s Ad26.COV2.S COVID vaccine , which is also an adenovirus vectored vaccine like AstraZeneca \u2019 s AZD1222.9 A study conducted in the U.S. looked at a case of GBS with atypical onset following vaccination with AZD1222 .\nThe subject , a 62-year-old man , presented to the Emergency Department with visual discomfort 10 days after vaccination with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patient became bedridden .\nThe study authors speculate that the onset of GBS after vaccination involved an antibody cross-reaction .\nBecause there is a known general association between vaccination and GBS , the authors suggested that an increase in GBS rates could be due to the unprecedented COVID vaccine push.11 A study in Taiwan looking at hospital records , along with a systemic review of the literature , revealed that COVID vaccination most likely causes GBS within two weeks of vaccination .\nThe Taiwan study also stated that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers at 9 branches of a Taiwan hospital who received AZD1222 between Mar .\n22-31 , 2021 and followed them for 30 days .\nThe study also summarized published cases of GBS on PubMed and Embase through Aug. 17 , 2021 .\nResearchers identified one case of GBS among the health care workers after the first dose of AZD1222 and 38 cases of GBS associated with COVID vaccines in the medical literature .\nThe majority of GBS cases occurred in people who received AZD1222 ( 25 out of 39 cases ) followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , with Ad26.COV2.S and Sinovac \u2019 s CoronaVac vaccines accounting for 1 case each .\nThe rate of GBS after COVID-19 vaccination ranged from 1.8 to 53.2 cases per 1 million doses given .\nIt took an average of 11.3 days for vaccine recipients to begin having symptoms of GBS.13 In Australia , the connection between the AZD1222 and GBS was first made in 2021 when six cases of GBS had been reported after COVID vaccinations , according to the Therapeutic Goods Administration ( TGA ) .\nTGA officials did not immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine and GBS , claiming that six reports out of 1.8 million doses wasn \u2019 t cause for concern .\nGBS is more common in adults over the age of 50 , which is the same age group being targeted for AZD1222 vaccinations .\nThe TGA did not conclude that there is a causal relationship between the vaccine and GBS .\nInstead , TGA officials referred to GBS as an \u201c adverse event of special interest.\n\u201d 14 By August 2021 , however , 89 cases of GBS were reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add a warning to the vaccine product information page about an association between GBS and AZD1222.15 Vaccines Have Historically Been Linked to GBS The connection between vaccination and GBS is not new .\nThe mass campaign for the Swine Flu vaccine in 1976 was curtailed due to numerous reports of vaccine recipients becoming paralyzed from GBS.16 The National Swine Flu Immunization program was quickly enacted prior to the flu season after Congress passed emergency legislation to immediately create a vaccine to stop a Swine Flu epidemic predicted by public health officials .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no evidence that a Swine Flu epidemic was taking place , a mass vaccination program was launched with the experimental influenza vaccine.17 Unfortunately , the live virus vaccine caused GBS in more than 450 Swine Flu vaccine recipients .\nMeanwhile there was no evidence that there was a Swine Flu epidemic or that a new influenza virus was even circulating in America at all.18 the Swine Flu mass vaccination program came to a halt in mid-December 1976 , but only after 45 million Americans ( 25 percent of the population ) had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenza vaccine was also found to carry an increased risk of developing GBS as a serious adverse reaction .\nAccording to researchers , 77 H1N1 vaccine recipients developed GBS , which is equivalent to 1.6 extra cases per 1 million persons vaccinated.20 Receiving the annual influenza vaccine has been linked to an increase in the risk of developing GBS .\nIn 2013 , the Federal Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines voted to add GBS to the Vaccine Injury Table as part of the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and it was officially added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine has also been linked to an increase in GBS cases .\nAccording to PubMed , between 2006 and 2009 , there

the active surveillance of this adverse vaccine outcome.22 In 2021 , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) began requiring that a warning about the risk of GBS be included with the prescribing information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The post marketing observation study showed that there is an increased risk of developing GBS within 42 days of receiving the shingles vaccine.23 If you would like to receive

, said that the United Nations organization is working with partners and the scientific community around the world to change the name in light of concern by some that the word \u201c monkeypox \u201d

Vaccine to Babies", "date": "2022-06-21", "source": "thevaccinereaction", "title": "U.S. Becomes First Country to Give mRNA COVID Vaccine to Babies", "content": "On June 15 , 2022 the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee ( VRBPAC ) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) unanimously advised the FDA staff to grant Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech an Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) amendment to allow their mRNA COVID vaccines to be given to children under age five and as young as six months.1 2 3 Within 48 hours , the FDA approved the EUA amendment followed by a June 17-18 meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a unanimous recommendation for both COVID vaccines to be given to all children in the six-month to five-year-old age group , which was immediately approved by the CDC \u2019 s director.4 5 National rollout of the reduced dose vaccines is underway this week and , with it , the U.S. becomes the first country to give COVID vaccine to children under age two.6 Natural immunity from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been documented to be robust and long lasting,7 8 9 and the CDC estimated in April that about 75 percent of children ages 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already had been infected.10 After the CDC admitted in March that pediatric deaths from COVID were initially over-estimated,11 a June 15 FDA briefing document stated that , \u201c According to death certificate data , 202 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19 among children 6 months to 4 years of age through May 11 , 2022.\n\u201d 12 The FDA briefing document confirmed that \u201c many persons \u201d with COVID are \u201c presenting with asymptomatic or mild disease , \u201d noting that symptoms in children are \u201c generally milder \u201d and as many as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asymptomatic .\nThe agency said that about half of the children four years old or younger , who were hospitalized with COVID , had one or more underlying health conditions.13 FDA summary documents for both Moderna and Pfizer vaccines show weak efficacy , especially when considering that the FDA did not require COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers to demonstrate their vaccines prevent infection and transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to obtain an EUA.14 The companies were only required to demonstrate a minimum 50 percent efficacy in preventing severe COVID disease leading to hospitalization and death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both companies in December 2020 .\nAs the SARS-CoV-2 virus has evolved and created different variants over the past two years , COVID disease has been reported in a growing number of vaccinated people with quickly waning immunity , who are able to transmit the virus to others even though they are vaccinated.15 16 On June 15 , 2022 , the Washington State Department of Health reported that , between Jan. 17 , 2021 and June 4 , 2022 , over reported COVID cases occurred in vaccinated persons in that state , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two percent being hospitalized and 0.4 percent dying of COVID-related illness.17 The clinical trial data from Pfizer and Moderna that the FDA used to green light administering mRNA COVID vaccines to very young children revealed that the efficacy of two 25 microgram doses ( one quarter of the adult dose ) of the Moderna COVID vaccine given about a month apart to children six months to five years old , who had not been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 , was 50.6 percent in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in a six to 23 month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a two to five year old age group .\nThe Pfizer COVID vaccine , which is given in three doses containing three micrograms ( one tenth the adult dose ) with three weeks between the first and second dose and two months between the second and third dose , was tested in children aged six months to five years old .\nAlthough Pfizer reported 80 percent efficacy after the third dose in children under five , the numbers of children evaluated were so tiny that the FDA staff simply commented in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c In these FDA analyses , the immune response to the vaccine for both age groups of children was comparable to the immune response of the older participants.\n\u201d 18 Knowing that the mRNA COVID vaccines do not reliably prevent infection and transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus , and that efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID disease is marginal at best , have Pfizer , Moderna and the FDA and CDC demonstrated that it is safe to give mRNA COVID vaccines to all babies as young as six months old ?\nAccording to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week , there is a gap between what is known and is not known about mRNA COVID vaccine safety in young children : The key words are \u201c the known and potential risks.\n\u201d There is lack of clarity and transparency on that point and one reason is because the release of this vaccine for babies as young as six months old is based on an EUA , not full licensure .\nThis is the first vaccine to be recommended for and administered to babies in the U.S. on a mass basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The June 18 public statement issued by the CDC did not contain any language about risk and only stated that , \u201d COVID-19 vaccines have undergone\u2014and will continue to undergo\u2014the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history.\n\u201d The CDC Director told doctors and parents that , \u201c All children , including children who have already had COVID-19 , should get vaccinated , \u201d 20 a policy that was immediately endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) .21 She gave that order even though the majority of babies and young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immunity from prior infections , and even though the majority of children enrolled in the Moderna and Pfizer COVID vaccine clinical trials had not been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 .\nThis means that the potential risks of giving mRNA COVID vaccines to babies and young children with a history of prior SARS-COV-2 infection ( many asymptomatic ) are unknown .\nIn 2013 , an Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) committee confirmed that the safety of the CDC recommended childhood vaccine schedule from birth to age six has not been fully scientifically evaluated.22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Safety : Stakeholder Concerns , Scientific Evidence and Future Studies,23 the committee stated , \u201c key elements of the entire schedule \u2013 the number , frequency , timing , order and age at administration of vaccines \u2013 have not been systematically evaluated in research studies.\n\u201d The IOM committee also warned that : Nothing appears to have changed in the past decade .\nOn June 18 , the ACIP Committee told doctors to give mRNA COVID vaccines at the same time with other CDC recommended childhood vaccines .\nAlready , a six-month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 15- month old toddler can receive 11 CDC recommended vaccines on the same day.24 Where is the science evaluating the potential risks of adding a COVID shot to that mix ?\nFollowing is a June 15 response by Doran Fink , MD , PhD , Acting Deputy Director of FDA Office Vaccines Research & Review to a question from a VRBPAC temporary voting member about co-administration of COVID vaccines with other vaccines that he asked in light of the fact that pediatricians see \u201c enhanced fever and even febrile seizures with co-administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever.\n\u201d Dr. Fink \u2019 s reply confirmed that Moderna and Pfizer have not produced safety data regarding co-administration of their COVID vaccines to six-month old babies and young children : 25 Pfizer , Moderna and federal health agencies have published information that both mRNA COVID vaccines are generally very reactive , with the majority of adults and older children experiencing local and systemic reactions within seven days of vaccination that can require a two to three day recovery period.26 27 28 There are multiple articles in the medical literature documenting that mRNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response in the majority of people vaccinated , which is manifested by a range of symptoms , including fever , chills , injection site pain , fatigue , headache , and body aching.29 Yet , the adverse reaction charts from clinical studies presented last week at the FDA and CDC advisory committee meetings for children under age five , especially for babies , suggest that there is little difference between the vaccinated and saline placebo groups for many commonly reported adverse events following the low dose Pfizer COVID vaccine , such as fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , headache , chills , diarrhea , and joint pain , with the exception that more reactions were reported after the second dose just like in older children and adults.30 The Moderna vaccine , which uses a higher pediatric dose , more often showed a bigger difference between commonly reported reactions in the vaccinated and placebo groups.31 But the dominant take-home message of the COVID vaccine clinical trial adverse reaction charts for younger children is that a whole lot of babies and toddlers are having fevers , chills , fatigue , irritability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t receive the COVID vaccine .\nIn some charts , the companies claim that the placebo group had more adverse events reported than the vaccinated group .\nWhether the charts are accurate or not , the bottom line is that parents who choose to give their young children the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA COVID vaccine should monitor for any unusual physical , mental or emotional symptoms after vaccination .\nParents know their children best and should not assume that health deterioration after COVID vaccinations has no relationship with the vaccine recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted for both vaccines after second doses .\nVaccine adverse event symptoms that were looked at in the pre-EUA studies included high fever ; irritability/crying ; excessive sleepiness ; pain , redness and swelling at injection site ; refusal to eat ; trouble breathing , rapid heart rate and chest pain ( myocarditis ) ; swollen lymph nodes ; muscle aches ; vomiting and diarrhea ; trembling or jerking of the limbs ( seizure ) and respiratory infections following vaccination , all of which should be recorded in the child \u2019 s medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitalizations , injuries and deaths , should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) .\nSince 1990 , more than 2.1 million adverse events for all vaccines have been reported to VAERS by June 10 , 2022 , with more than 1.2 million of those adverse events associated with either the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA COVID vaccines.32 In addition to being the first vaccine to be fast tracked under an EUA rather than full licensure and given to millions of infants and young children in the U.S. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to use an mRNA technology that has remained experimental until now .\nFor example , Pfizer spent just 248 days testing their mRNA COVID vaccine using a never-before licensed technology , which injects synthetic mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles into the body to induce cells to make the SARS-COV-2 spike protein and become\u2014in the words of the World Economic Forum\u2014 \u201c vaccine production plants.\n\u201d 33 34 To speed up the COVID vaccine testing process , FDA allowed Pfizer and other drug companies to conduct some of the animal and human clinical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further accelerate approval , FDA also allowed companies to provide testing data from previous research on other types of experimental mRNA vaccines as preliminary proof that COVID mRNA vaccines were effective and safe , even though those other mRNA vaccines were never licensed.36 Two years before Pfizer and Moderna got an EUA to distribute their mRNA vaccines , academic researchers warned of potential safety issues with the platform , like local and systemic inflammation ; stimulation of hyper-inflammatory immune responses causing chronic inflammation and autoimmunity ; and the presence of extracellular RNA that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood clots.37 This is the first human vaccine to include lipid nanoparticles , which coat the synthetic mRNA in COVID vaccines and are highly inflammatory.38 There are questions about bio-distribution and a debate about whether those nanoparticles can accumulate in different organs of the body like the liver , spleen , lungs , kidneys and perhaps crosses the blood brain barrier , or end up in the ovaries and potentially affect fertility.39 Myocarditis and pericarditis ( inflammation of the heart ) have been reported after both Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID vaccines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult males and after the second dose.40 Other severe adverse events reported in the medical literature include anaphylaxis and blood and immune mediated neurological disorders like Guillain Barre Syndrome ( GBS ) .41 The data evaluating these more serious adverse events in infants and young children is too limited to know how many children will exhibit signs of immune and brain dysfunction after receiving mRNA COVID vaccines .\nDuring the public comment period of the day-long June 15 VRBPAC meeting , which can be viewed on YouTube,42 most of the comments were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delay in making COVID vaccine available for their young children , which they have kept house-bound and masked children for two years .\nHowever , there were a few comments that opposed the EUA amendment , including Texas Congressman and attorney Louis Gohmert ( at 5:07 ) who said , \u201c There are many unanswered questions regarding the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines , especially for babies and young children , and I am deeply concerned that the push to vaccinate these children is nothing more than a dystopian experiment with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mother Shae Lynn ( at 5:16 ) described how an mRNA COVID vaccine reaction ruined her life , with doctors dismissing her symptoms and ignoring her pleas for help .\nExpertly schooling the committee on what the FDA knew about the risks of mRNA vaccines but \u201c did nothing \u201d about , Sam Dodson ( at 5:27 ) declared , \u201c You have abjectly failed in your sole duty to ensure the safety of any drug given to Americans.\n\u201d 78 Percent of Americans Have Gotten COVID Shots But Parents of Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2022 , about 78 percent of Americans over age five had been given COVID vaccinations,43 with about 222 million of them \u201c fully vaccinated \u201d according to the CDC and about 121 million having received one or two booster shots.44 The CDC said the new COVID vaccine recommendation for babies as young as six months old will open up the market to about 20 million more children , but the agency noted that only about 29 percent of children ages five to 11 have been vaccinated since the Pfizer mRNA COVID vaccine was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2021.45 An April 2022 poll revealed that four in 10 parents with children under age five are hesitant to give their young children COVID vaccine with 27 percent saying they will \u201c definitely not \u201d vaccinate their children and 11 percent indicating they will only do it if it is mandated.46 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week ,

articles reviewing some studies purported to show COVID-19 vaccines are useful for countering so-called long-COVID , lingering symptoms after COVID infection .\nThe conclusion of the author , who is an ex-senior scientist with the U.K. government , is that the vaccinations do not in fact prevent those symptoms .\nIn addition one of the studies he quotes shows a great increase in health-related problems resulting from vaccination , which the authors seem to have tried to bury .\nThe interesting thing here is how we have , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from eagerly awaiting vaccines that would eradicate

disease they wouldn \u2019 t have caught , let alone fallen ill with , had the vaccines worked as promised .\nAt the same time , more and more data from all over the world show how the vaccine rollout is in fact correlated with a large spike in excess mortality .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccines , the use of which was discontinued in most countries in favor of the mRNA vaccines .\nThat may have been a premature decision , as contrary to the mRNA vaccines , they seem to lower excess mortality .\nTo sum it up , no protection against infection , the vaccinated seem to fall ill just as easily as the

genetically-engineered live virus vaccines , which they refer to as \u201c contagious \u201d vaccines , that can transmit vaccine strain viruses through a population on their own .\nThe vaccines are so contagious that only five percent of the population would need to receive the shot , while the other 95 percent would be passively vaccinated through vaccine strain infection , shedding and transmission .\nA \u201d contagious \u201d vaccine would spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with body fluids of a recently vaccinated person , such as saliva or nasal secretions , like when a person sneezes or coughs and inhales droplets from someone infected with a cold or influenza virus.1 Spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic , researchers in the United States , Europe and Australia are looking into the using these types of community transmissible vaccines in the future.2 The live oral polio vaccine ( OPV ) was the first vaccine that public health officials used to deliberately infect populations with a vaccine strain virus as a strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infections .\nIn fact , one reason OPV was considered superior to the inactivated polio vaccine ( IPV ) was because it passively revaccinated people coming into close contact with recently vaccinated persons ( without their knowledge or informed consent ) .3 Recipients of OPV-shed vaccine strain virus in urine , feces , saliva and nasal secretions , and in populations where OPV is used , cases of vaccine strain polio paralysis can occur in recently vaccinated persons or close contacts , such as parents changing the diapers of a recently vaccinated baby.4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OPV for children and switched to IPV to eliminate cases of vaccine strain polio .\nThe environmental impact of vaccine strain polio virus contaminating water supplies re-surfaced recently in London , U.K. where \u201c vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 ( VDPV2 ) \u201d was detected and public health officials urged everyone to be \u201c up to date \u201d on polio vaccinations.5 In 2014 , Barbara Loe Fisher , co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center ( NVIC ) and executive editor of The Vaccine Reaction , published a referenced report , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virus Vectored Vaccines : Vaccine Strain Infection , Shedding and Transmission , which reviewed the potential for harm that use of live virus and vectored vaccines could do to humans and the environment.6 The first experiment with contagious vaccines was conducted on an island off of the coast of Spain in 1999 .\nVeterinarian Jos\u00e9 Manuel S\u00e1nchez-Vizca\u00edno , PhD captured 147 rabbits and vaccinated 73 of them with a self-spreading vaccine he created combining rabbit hemorrhagic disease and myxoma virus .\nHe placed a microchip in all of the rabbits to monitor them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBecause the vaccine was so closely related to the disease causing myxoma virus , Dr. S\u00e1nchez-Vizca\u00edno believed that the vaccine would spread along rabbits in the wild .\nWhen the veterinarian recaptured the rabbits about a month later , he found that 56 percent of the unvaccinated rabbits had antibodies to both viruses.7 Currently , self-spreading vaccines are being tested in animal populations across the world .\nApproximately 10 labs worldwide are working on developing contagious vaccines as of September 2020.8 The majority of the labs are in the U.S. with others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources of funding for this research comes from NIH , the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) , the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , academic institutions and the Gates Foundation.9 Researchers in Europe are currently working with contagious vaccines in pig populations.10 DARPA is considering self-spreading vaccines to help combat West African Lassa fever , a viral disease spread by rats in West Africa.11 12 Contagious vaccines are currently being made for Ebola and bovine tuberculosis , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help control Lyme disease , West Nile virus , rabies and the plague .\nThey believe that self-spreading vaccines are an ideal way to vaccinate wild animals to reduce the risk that one day the viruses and bacteria will spontaneously jump from animals to humans.13 Researchers are developing two types of contagious wildlife vaccines : ( 1 ) transferrable vaccines , which are applied to the animal \u2019 s fur by way of a paste that will spread the vaccine via grooming and other close contact activities ; and ( 2 ) transmissible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orally , and allow the virus to spread through breathing , touch , sexual relations , and nursing .\nWhile transmissible vaccines have the potential to vaccinate more remote animals at a faster rate , some scientists are concerned that the speed at which transmissible vaccines spread vaccine strain infection could pose a greater risk of mutation or co-infection with other viruses in the wild , which then could infect humans .\nResearch on contagious vaccines is not limited to the wild animal population .\nScientists believe they can develop self-spreading vaccines using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmitted from person to person worldwide but not cause serious illness .\nThe majority of self-spreading vaccines use viral vector technology similar to the technology used by the virus vectored AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson COVID vaccines.14 Scientists make a weakened form of the target virus , such as the HIV virus , in a lab and insert DNA from it into a more contagious but milder virus , such as one of the viruses that cause symptoms of the common cold .\nDNA fragments from the target virus , in effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocuous virus and spread it among the population , which scientist say primes the immune system to be prepared for the targeted more dangerous virus and , hopefully , does not cause serious disease , injury or death along the way .\nTheir plan is for a small group of people in different parts of the world to either be injected with or inhale a contagious vaccine that would self-spread across the globe.15 \u201c Some people will die \u201d When Humans Are Exposed to Contagious Vaccines The U.K. government is looking into using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current influenza vaccine to combat type A and B influenza .\nWhile scientists admit that some people would die from this type of clandestine mass vaccination strategy , they believe that because the number of people who may die from self-spreading vaccination would be less than the number of people who may die from the actual influenza , this type of secret passive vaccination plan is justified.16 Meanwhile , other researchers warn that self-spreading novel vaccine technology could produce dire consequences .\nJonas Sandbrink , biosecurity researcher at the University of Oxford \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No safety studies have been conducted in the field or laboratory for contagious vaccines.19 Andrew Peters , PhD , associate professor of wildlife health and pathology at Charles Sturt University in Australia and president of Wildlife Disease Association , warned : Fillipa Lentozos , PhD , science and international security expert at Kings College London , cautions that it is hard to predict what a contagious vaccine could do in the future because viruses are inherently unstable and frequently mutate .\nThere is concern that a virus exclusively found in certain wildlife could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host of problems for animals and humans alike.21 Another concern with wiping out diseases in wild animals through contagious vaccines is that certain species could become overpopulated once they are no longer susceptible to vaccine treated diseases .\nFor example , rodents that contract Lasso virus destroy crops , homes , food and water storages and contribute to unsanitary conditions .\nIf they no longer face the threat of Lasso virus , these rodents could become overpopulated and cause havoc .\nAnother issue is that , by disturbing the ecosystem where viruses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many , other viruses or bacteria may emerge to cause disease .\nCritics of contagious vaccines want to approach this technology using the Precautionary Principle which states that harmful technology should not be developed until we know with a reasonable degree of scientific certainty exactly how the technology will operate and what the short and long-term consequences may be .\nSetting about changes to wildlife population could threaten the biodiversity of the ecosystem.23 Science Journal recently issued a policy statement in which scientists warn that contagious vaccines are dangerous and difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used safely and predictably outside contained facilities \u201d 24 This risk is an \u201c evidence-based norm \u201d rather than an opinion , according to the scientists , and \u201c as this norm now seems to be challenged , \u201d there is the potential for \u201c risky research on lab-modified self-spreading viruses.\n\u201d 25 According to the policy statement , self-spreading vaccine research has taken off in recent years with programs being run currently by

diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) in the United States has risen to 1 in 30 .\nThe study , which was conducted by public health researchers at Guandong Pharmaceutical University in China , looked at data from the annual National Health Interview Survey ( NHIS ) maintained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , estimated there was a 52 percent increase in ASD

published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases , Watson et al .\napply mathematical modeling to estimate that mass COVID-19 vaccinations saved between 14-20 million lives worldwide during the first year of the COVID-19 vaccination program .\nPrevious Brownstone [ Institute ] articles by Horst and Raman have already pointed out several erroneous assumptions in the study regarding infection- vs. vaccine-derived immunity duration as well as the fact it did not account for vaccine adverse events and all-cause mortality risk .\nHere , I summarize the mechanics of how the authors arrived at their estimates of deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then elaborate on how flawed assumptions in the model can lead to grossly inflated estimates of averted deaths , which may explain the study \u2019 s lack of face validity and internal consistency .\nThe study uses a generative model of COVID-19 transmission , infection , and mortality dynamics that includes 20-25 assumed parameters based on select literature ( i.e .\nvaccine effectiveness against transmission , infection , and death , age-mixtures of each country , age-stratified infection fatality rates etc . )\nthat is fitted to reported excess deaths in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmissibility across time in 185 countries .\nThe study compares actual 2021 excess deaths to simulations ( counterfactuals ) that are supposed to predict the trajectory of excess deaths in each country if no vaccines had been introduced ( i.e .\nby running multiple simulations of the above fitted models after removing the effects of vaccines ) .\nThe difference between these counterfactual curves and actual excess deaths result in the estimated deaths averted due to vaccination .\nThe authors \u2019 models do not appear to account for evolution of the infectivity or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explicitly modeling an increase in infection hospitalization rates due to the Delta variant ( see 1.2.3 Variants of Concern section in the Supplement ) .\nThe primary assumption in the counterfactual simulations is that excess deaths are explained by the \u201c natural \u201d evolution of the virus as reflected in its time-varying transmissibility , which can only be inferred ( fitted ) and not validated .\nIf the models assume parameters that over- or misestimate vaccine effectiveness against transmission , infection and death as well as the duration of vaccine protection , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this will lead to an over- or misestimation of time-varying virus transmissibility in order to achieve a good fit with the excess death curves in each country .\nThis in turn , would artificially inflate the estimated excess deaths when the effects of vaccination are subsequently removed from the counterfactual simulations .\nWe elaborate on these points below .\nThe Models in Watson et al .\nRely On Unrealistic Assumptions About Vaccine-Derived Immunity It is not clear whether the authors consider waning vaccine effectiveness in their models , and it appears that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the entire one-year study period , even though studies have suggested it is somewhere between three to six months .\nThe model they cite , Hogan et al .\n2021 by default assumes \u201c long-term \u201d ( i.e .\n> one year ) vaccine protection ( see Table 1. in Hogan et al .\n2021 ) .\nIn addition , virtually every study of vaccine efficacy or effectiveness either excludes or lumps symptomatic cases within 21 days of first dose or within 14 days of second dose with the \u201c unvaccinated \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of evidence that COVID infectivity may increase almost three-fold during the first week post-injection ( see Figure 1 in our commentary of the study ) .\nThis suggests that reported vaccine effectiveness estimates that are based on lower case rates observed > six weeks post-injection may ( at least partially ) be accounted for by infection- , not vaccine- , induced immunity due to short-term increases in COVID-19 infectivity immediately following vaccination .\nWhile the models in Watson et al .\ninclude a latency period between vaccination and when protection kicks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential increase in vaccine-induced infectivity and transmissibility during this period .\nNot accounting for this effect in the models would overestimate naturally evolving and time-varying virus transmissibility and thus inflate excess deaths in the counterfactual simulations that exclude vaccination effects .\nFinally , the authors explored the impact of immune evasion from infection-derived immunity by conducting a sensitivity analysis to estimate the deaths averted by vaccinations with different immune escape percentages ranging from zero percent to 80 percent ( see Supplementary Figure 4 in the original article ) .\nIn these models , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constant ( non-waning ) vaccine protection which is an unrealistic assumption ( see above paragraph ) .\nHowever , the authors do not appear to do a similar sensitivity analysis of immune evasion from vaccine-derived immunity , which is important given the point raised in the above paragraph .\nModels Ignore Excess Deaths Due to Factors Other Than COVID-19 The fitted models and their counterfactuals assume that excess deaths in each country are explained solely by a naturally evolving COVID-19 virus and its ( fitted model-inferred ) time-varying transmissibility .\nThe models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths caused by other pandemic-related factors , for example the vaccines themselves as well as other nonpharmaceutical compulsory interventions .\nThe CDC reports an overall vaccine-induced death risk of 0.0026 percent per dose based on the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System , or VAERS .\nVAERS is a passive reporting system and may only capture\u2014one percent of all vaccine-related side effects .\nMore recent independent lines of evidence using VAERS and credible assumptions about underreporting factors and ecological regression of publicly available vaccination and all-cause mortality data suggest VAERS may only capture\u2014five percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the models do not account for excess deaths resulting from other factors such as lockdown-induced \u201c deaths of despair.\n\u201d By ignoring other potential sources of pandemic-related excess deaths in their models , the fitted models will over- and/or misestimate the effects of natural , time-varying virus transmissibility in order to achieve a good model fit with reported excess deaths , which in turn would lead to inflated excess death counts in their counterfactual simulations .\nAccording to the authors \u2019 country level estimates 1.9 million deaths were averted in the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Supplementary Table 3 in original study ) .\nIn the first year of the pandemic when no vaccines were available ( 2020 ) , there\u200b\u200b were 351,039 U.S. COVID deaths .\nThe authors \u2019 models thus suggest that 1.9M / 350k = ~5.5x as many COVID deaths in the U.S. would have occurred in 2021 ( vs. 2020 ) had no vaccines been introduced ( see Figure 2 in our commentary of the study ) .\nThis is highly implausible as there is very little reason to believe the virus would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmissible , infective and lethal .\nThe authors allude to higher transmissibility in 2021 due to the relaxing and/or lifting of public health measures and restrictions ( lockdowns , travel restrictions , mask mandates etc. )\n.\nHowever , the assumption that this could account for a > five-fold increase in COVID deaths in 2021 contradicts > 400 studies that have concluded there were little to no public health benefits of these measures in reducing COVID outcomes .\nMoreover , in 2021 ( after vaccination was introduced ) , there were 474,890 U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent higher than 2021 , suggesting crude evidence that mass vaccinations worsened COVID outcomes overall , consistent with observations of increased infectivity before vaccine protection kicks in ( see 1st point above ) and concerns of enhanced severity of COVID-19 disease caused by the vaccines based on preclinical studies .\nWhile generative models are often a useful tool to simulate scenarios that have not occurred , inaccurate assumptions about model parameters can easily lead to model misspecification .\nIn the case of Watson et al .\n2022 , they can lead to counterfactual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averted due to mass vaccinations .\nBecause such complicated modeling can be overly sensitive to input parameters , prone to overfitting and gives outputs that are difficult , if not impossible to validate , it should not be used to inform public health policy and guidelines .\nQuantitative risk-benefit ratio analyses that use clinical trial or real-world data to compare risks of specific outcomes , such as all-cause mortality or myopericarditis following vaccination and coronavirus infection , are much more informative and useful in this regard .\nNote : I

"title": "Research Confirms Menstrual Cycle Bleeding Changes After COVID Shot", "content": "Last week , University of Illinois researchers published a study funded by the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) in the journal Science Advances on menstrual cycle bleeding changes after COVID shots .\nThe study featured a web-based survey of almost 40,000 individuals and found 42 percent of those who were menstruating reported unexpected heavy bleeding after receiving a COVID shot , while 66 percent of postmenopausal individuals reported breakthrough bleeding.1 The study included respondents aged 18 to 80 who were considered to be \u201c fully \u201d vaccinated .\nIt did not include a representative unvaccinated group for comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More Bleeding After COVID Shots The study \u2019 s main findings were that a heavier menstrual flow was more likely for those respondents who were of non-white race ; were Hispanic/Latinx ; were older ; had a diagnosed reproductive condition ; used hormonal contraception ; had been pregnant in the past ( whether or not they had given birth ) ; were parous ( had given birth ) , or had experienced fever or fatigue after vaccination .\nA higher proportion of respondents with reproductive conditions often associated with altered bleeding ( endometriosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , polycystic ovarian syndrome and adenomyosis ) experienced a heavier menstrual flow than those without diagnosed reproductive conditions .\nThe combination of a reproductive history that includes having been pregnant but not giving birth in the past was associated with the highest risk of heavier flow after a COVID shot , although having given birth ( parity ) was also associated with heavier flow .\nThe type of COVID , race , and use of hormonal contraception were not significant factors.2 In the regularly menstruating group , 43.6 percent reported no change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent reported a mixture of light or no change , 42.1 percent reported heavier menstrual flow following vaccination.3 The non-menstruating group consisted of those over age 55 , who were postmenopausal and had not bled for at least twelve months before vaccination , as well as those who were premenopausal and using long acting ( LARC ) or continuous hormonal contraceptives and/or gender-affirming hormones that eliminates menstruation .\nAmong those who were postmenopausal and not on any hormonal treatments , breakthrough bleeding was reported by 66 percent of respondents .\nAge was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who were younger ( mean = 59.8 years ) experiencing it more often than those who did not ( mean = 61.4 years ) .\nNon-Hispanic individuals were also less likely to experience breakthrough bleeding .\nJust over 70 percent of non-menstruating respondents using LARC reported breakthrough bleeding , while 38.5 percent of those using gender-affirming hormones reported changes .\nIncreased bleeding associated with menstruation is often distressing and may require providers to perform diagnostic procedures to investigate its origins .\nThis is especially true after menstruation has stopped , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleeding occurs , which could be an early sign of cancer .\nResponsiveness to external stressors can affect menstruation and is one reason menstrual cycles are seen as reflecting overall health status , or a so-called \u201c vital sign \u201d in clinical practice.4 If potential side effects of a medical treatment like a vaccine are not widely shared with doctors and patients , it can lead to unnecessary , painful , and expensive diagnostic procedures such as uterine biopsy .\nStudy authors pointed out that the uterine reproductive system is flexible and adaptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows it to weather short term challenges in a way that leaves long-term fertility intact .\nRunning a marathon , short-term calorie restriction and psychosocial stressors , for instance , can correspond to menstrual cycle irregularity .\nAn immunological challenge like a vaccination or an illness can cause systemic inflammation in the body that provokes immune mediated responses in organs , including the uterus , and inflammation influences ovarian hormones.5 Vaccine Effects on Changes in Menstruation Not Well Studied Menstruation is seldom considered a variable during vaccine trials , aside from researchers determining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menstrual period as part of established protections against volunteers being or getting pregnant .\nThe vast majority of research that has been conducted regarding reproductive and menstrual function centers around whether live attenuated vaccines are safe to give to someone who is pregnant or whether vaccination affects fertility .\nThe research that has been conducted on menstrual cycles specifically is often unable to establish a causal link , as the data are obtained through retrospective surveys , data mining and randomized controlled trials , which often do not allow a mechanism for reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not typically monitor for acute adverse events for more than seven days , and additional follow-up communications by researchers rarely\u2014if ever\u2014inquire about menstrual cycles or bleeding .\nTherefore , manufacturers have not systematically investigated the extent to which changes in menstruation is a coincidence or a potential side effect of the vaccine being investigated .\nIn media coverage , medical doctors and public health experts often hasten to say that there was \u201c no biological mechanism \u201d or \u201c no data \u201d to support a relationship between vaccine administration and menstrual changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these changes were more likely a result of \u201c stress.\n\u201d 7 Dismissal by medical experts of menstrual irregularities after vaccination can fuel even greater public concern .\nChanges in Fertility After COVID Shots Difficult to Assess Concerns about changes in fertility following COVID shots have been difficult to assess because many women , who were enrolled in the pre-Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) clinical trials , were using contraception and , therefore , pregnancy rates were extremely low.8 Pfizer and Moderna advise those who are pregnant when they receive mRNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnancy registry to help monitor outcomes in women exposed to their products during pregnancy.9 10 Both manufacturer product inserts state that available data on their products \u201c administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy.\n\u201d 11 12 Pfizer and Moderna report that safety of the mRNA biologics when given to pregnant women was evaluated using toxicity studies in rats injected with the mRNA product twice before mating and twice during gestation .\nThe companies said there were no vaccine-related fetal malformations or variations and no adverse effects on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston University \u2019 s Pregnancy Study Online ( PRESTO ) may help to evaluate changes in menstrual patterns and fertility after women receive mRNA shots .\nPRESTO is a prospective cohort study initiated in 2013 that recruits women and their male partners , who are actively trying to conceive but are not yet pregnant .\nThe study evaluates risk factors for delayed conception , miscarriage and adverse birth outcomes , and is the first internet-based fertility study in the United States.15 PRESTO study director and professor of epidemiology Lauren Wise , ScD said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful , because what we do is we only compare women before and after they received the vaccination .\nSo , it \u2019 s not like we \u2019 re enrolling people who have already had a vaccination and the menstrual changes into our study .\nWe would only be looking at their data comparing before the vaccination versus after .\nAnd so that \u2019 s a good way to guard against any bias in the reporting of the menstrual factors or the selection of the participants into the study.\n\u201d 16 The frightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to pregnant women in the 1950 \u2019 s caused fetal malformations , as well as fear of harming women \u2019 s fertility , made drug makers leery of testing drugs in women and , particularly , in pregnant women .\nIn 1993 , the NIH passed the Revitalization Act , requiring researchers they funded to include both women and men in clinical studies , and to analyze their results by sex or gender .\nWhile experts say the gaps in science have narrowed , the system is still failing women .\n( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods \u2019 mental health effects is scarce , even though some studies suggest a link with depression . )\n17 The missing research makes it difficult for women to make confident health decisions , especially around their sexual and reproductive health .\nAs a result , women may risk adverse effects from an approved drug that was untested in women or suffer unnecessarily with health problems that just don \u2019 t occur in men .\n\u201c We \u2019 re constantly having to play experiments in our own bodies because nobody tested the drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play musical pills with anything we take , \u201d says Sarah Hill , PhD , a professor at Texas Christian University.18 Global Studies of Menstruation Changes After COVID Shots Show Similar Results Several other studies on COVID vaccination and menstrual changes have reported results similar to the most recent University of Illinois study .\nA study of 2269 menstruating women in the North Africa and Middle East region published in March 2022 reported that 66.3 percent reported post-vaccination abnormalities.19 An Italian study also published in March 2022 included 169 women of childbearing age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the past year , did not have gynecological or non-gynecological disease , and who were not receiving hormonal or non-hormonal treatments before they were vaccinated .\nThey reported that 50\u201360 percent of reproductive age women who received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine had menstrual cycle irregularities , regardless of the type of vaccine administered , with the occurrence of menstrual irregularities slightly higher ( 60 to 70 percent ) after the second dose , which suggested a potential challenge/re-challenge effect .\nAfter both the first and second doses of vaccine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavier menstrual cycles than usual or expected.20 Another study using data from the fertility tracking app Natural Cycles compared three menstrual cycles pre- and post-vaccine for the vaccinated group and six cycles total for the unvaccinated group .\nResearchers found a .71-day cycle increase in cycle length following a first dose of mRNA product and a .91-day cycle increase following a second dose .\nThere were no changes in cycle length in the unvaccinated group.21 NIH Awards Grants to Study Effects of COVID Shots on Menstruation In August 2021 , the NIH awarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to five academic institutions to explore potential links between COVID shots and menstrual changes .\nResearchers at Boston University , Harvard Medical School , Johns Hopkins University , Michigan State University and Oregon Health and Science University will conduct the research.22 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week , click here .", "author": "Marco Caceres", "url":

of COVID-19 vaccine doses manufactured using funds remaining on the existing agreement , pending completion of all quality testing.5 While three COVID biologics have already been approved for use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nuvaxovid is a more conventional protein-based vaccine than the messenger RNA ( mRNA ) biologics ( BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 ) developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna/NIAID , which use

Reporting System ( VAERS ) .7 Novavax and public health officials have expressed hopes that Novaxovid will be an acceptable COVID vaccine option for people who do not feel comfortable with the new mRNA technology .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to individuals who may have an allergic reaction to mRNA vaccines or who have a personal preference for receiving a vaccine other than a mRNA-based vaccine , \u201d notes HHS.5 According to an article in The Vaccine Reaction last month : The third COVID biologic that was approved by the FDA prior to the Novavax COVID vaccine is one produced by Johnson &

years of age and older who elect to receive the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine because they would otherwise not get a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\u201d 10 In a press release , the FDA said : The blood clotting

originated in a bat and accidently crossed over into humans , leading to the COVID-19 pandemic , it is odd that there does not appear to be much concern about producing vaccines that use genetic material from animals .\nYou would think that this would be especially true for COVID vaccines .\nBut apparently not.1 2 3 Novavax \u2019 s new Nuvaxovid vaccine , which recently received Emergency

Nuvaxovid \u201c offers adults in the United States who have not yet received a COVID-19 vaccine another option that meets the FDA \u2019 s rigorous standards for safety , effectiveness and

great alternative to the mRNA if that \u2019 s what you choose not to get , \u201d said Rich Lakins , vaccination director for the Utah Department of Health and Human Services.8 According to Guy Palmer , DVM , PhD , professor of pathology and infectious diseases at Washington State University , Nuvaxovid may appeal to people who believe that mRNA shots are unsafe because of the newness of technology and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DNA .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a slight open door there for a non-mRNA vaccine like Novavax , \u201d Dr. Palmer said.9 \u201c So for example , with the mRNA vaccines , we \u2019 re sort of giving you a message that gets incorporated into your body \u2019 s cells and teaches your cells how to build spike protein in its pure form and that \u2019 s what our MessengerrNA is , \u201d said Angela Branche , MD , professor of medicine at the University of Rochester.10 Nuvaxovid is different in that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body .\nThat is what is considered to be more traditional rather than experimental.10 So\u2026 not reprogramming your cells or \u201c rewriting \u201d your \u201c genetic code , \u201d as Moderna \u2019 s chief medical officer Tal Zaks , MD , PhD explained in a TED Talk , certainly sounds like a good thing .\nBut what about the \u201c insect cells \u201d ?\n11 In order to produce Nuvaxovid , Moderna uses cells from an insect known as a fall armyworm ( Spodoptera frugiperda ) \u2014a kind of moth\u2014to grow the spike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spike protein , which is taken from the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus , is what allows the virus to \u201c latch onto and enter human cells.\n\u201d 12 As noted in a recent article in SELF magazine : Army Worm Cells First Used for Influenza Vaccine In January 2013 , the FDA approved a license for Protein Sciences \u2019 FluBlok , the first trivalent influenza vaccine made using an insect virus ( baculovirus ) expression system and recombinant DNA technology .\nNow a quadrivalent vaccine , FluBlok contains three times as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasonal influenza vaccines that have been used for decades to try to control influenza.13 When FluBlok was licensed , the CEO of Protein Sciences , Manon Cox , PhD , was quoted in an article as acknowledging that it took the FDA a long time to license the new insect cell production technology because of safety concerns about residual proteins of non-human origin in FluBlok .\nCox said , \u201c All the evidence was that it was safe .\nThere were no signs that our new cell line wasn \u2019 t good enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove a negative.\n\u201d No Fear of Insect Viruses Crossing Over Into Humans ?\nIt was not that long ago that the media was widely reporting on the risk of animal viruses jumping to humans .\nThe issue was all the rage in 2020 and 2021 when the bat-in-a-wet-market theory was the predominant explanation for how COVID got started .\nBut is a COVID vaccine using insect viruses and infected insect cells a less worrisome alternative to the mRNA shots that concern a lot of people ?\n14 15 16 The day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) issued a warning of severe allergic reactions (

SARS-CoV-2 and found that the children \u2019 s innate immune system mounted a better response to the virus than the adults .\nThe children displayed , \u201c a more vigorous early mucosal immune response \u201d than the adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus faster.6 Changes to the Immune System Could Cause the Proliferation of Cancer Cells A June 2022 study published in Food and Chemical Toxicology reported that COVID vaccination causes a significant change in type 1 interferon ( INF type 1 ) signaling , initiates changes in short- and long-term immune competence and normal cellular function , and plays , \u201c a critical role in both controlling viral proliferation and inducing antibody production.\n\u201d 7 The study points out that INF 1 cells stop the growth of virus and cancer cells and are critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 .\nBecause the COVID vaccination has been shown to interfere with the proper functioning of INF 1 , the study authors , which include Stephanie Seneff , PhD , are concerned that patients who received the vaccine may be more susceptable to catching the virus in the first two weeks immediately after vaccination.8 They said the COVID shot could also interfere with the immune system \u2019 s recognition of and response to cancer cells because INF subtypes are especially important in preventing and recognizing cancer cells once they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and BRCA2 Associated Cancers The study authors argue that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein found in the COVID vaccines affects host cell exome production and causes the cells to create microRNA exomes that suppress the production of IRF9 and increase pro-inflammatory gene transcripts.10 They write : IRF9 suppression via exosomal microRNA should also be expected to impair the cancer-protective effects of BRCA2 gene activity , which depends on that molecule for its activity \u2026 BRCA2-associated cancers include breast , fallopian tube , and ovarian cancer for women ,

TRAIL signal transduction pathway for additional cancer surveillance , the suppression of IRF7 and IRF9 through vaccination and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein production is extremely concerning for long-term cancer control in SARS-CoV-2 mRNA genetic vaccine injected populations.12 A study published in The Lancet provided evidence that immune function can be adversely affected by

that N1 methylpseudouridine , which is part of the vaccine \u2019 s genetic code , could activate regulatory T cells and lead to lowered cellular immunity , which can prevent spike proteins from immediately decaying and , instead , circulating through the body for at least four months after vaccination .\nThe authors note that lipid nanoparticles containing mRNA are inflammatory and have also

"Chemical Imbalance Not a Major Cause of Depression, Studies Find", "content": "A new study published recently in the Journal of Molecular Psychiatry questions the hypothesis that serotonin inhibition is the cause of most depression disorders .\nAbout 21 million Americans are affected by major depressive disorder with one in six Americans taking antidepressant medication.1 2 3 The serotonin theory of depression came about in the 1950 \u2019 s when researchers found that the drug , iproniazid , which was used for the treatment of tuberculosis , helped alleviate depressive symptoms in patients.4 Iproniazid inhibits the monoamine oxidase enzyme ( MAOI ) , which recycles the monoamine neurotransmitters , serotonin , norepinephrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory that depressed individuals have lower levels of monoamine neurotransmitters .\nIn 1965 , psychiatrist Joseph Schildkraut , MD suggested that low levels of norepinephrine was the catalyst behind depression .\nResearchers then changed the focus to another neurotransmitter , serotonin , as the cause of depression.6 In 1987 , Eli Lily introduced Prozac ( fluoxetine ) for major depressive disorder .\nThe drug selectively inhibits the reuptake of serotonin ( SSRI ) and quickly became the best-selling antidepressant of all time .\nIn 1992 , Pfizer marketed another SSRI called Zoloft with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because depression was due to a chemical imbalance.7 In the most recent study , six European researchers undertook a systemic umbrella review of 17 studies that included tens of thousands of participants in order to determine whether SSRI \u2019 s were an effective treatment for depression .\nThey concluded that there was no evidence that depression was caused by lowered serotonin levels.8 Patients should not be told that depression is caused by low serotonin or by a chemical imbalance and they should not be led to believe that antidepressants work by targeting these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the idea that antidepressants work in the same way as insulin for diabetes is completely misleading .\nWe do not understand what antidepressants are doing to the brain exactly , and giving people this sort of misinformation prevents them from making an informed decision about whether to take antidepressants or not.10 Chemical Imbalance Theory of Depression Long Debunked by Many Doctors The recent findings were not news to many psychiatrists and medical researchers who discounted the chemical imbalance theory of depression years ago .\nMichael Bloomfield , MD , a consultant psychiatrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University College London , said : Even though the chemical imbalance theory of depression was abandoned long ago by many experts in the field of psychiatry , the public has been carefully taught and continues to believe that depression is caused by low serotonin and can only be corrected by taking antidepressant drugs .\nA 2013 Australian study found that 88.1 percent of study participants thought that depression was caused by a chemical imbalance .\nMoncrieff and other authors of the recent study attribute this misperception to effective but false advertising by pharmaceutical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of antidepressants .\nIn 2005 , a pair of professors challenged heavy direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns promoting SSRI \u2019 s as a cure for the chemical imbalance that causes depression .\nTheir article , \u201c Serotonin and Depression : A Disconnect Between the Advertisements and the Scientific Literature revealed the truth behind aggressive SSRI marketing campaigns , such as Pfizer \u2019 s television advertising for the antidepressant Zoloft claiming that the drug \u201c works to correct \u201d chemical imbalance in the body .\nThe authors found no scientific evidence that depression was caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they suggested that research has shown that there is scant evidence that any mental disorder is caused by a deficiency in any single neurotransmitter .\nThe researchers concluded that the advertising for SSRI \u2019 s did not reflect the evolving research debunking the serotonin hypothesis , and that direct-to-consumer advertisements suggesting that antidepressants could normalize neurotransmitters to stop depression is not backed by good scientific evidence .\nHowever , despite sending ten warning letters to drug manufacturers after the article was written , FDA officials took no further steps to curtail these misleading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No Real Impact on Quality of Life Another large study published in PLOS One in April 2022 found that the quality of life was no different for patients who took antidepressants and those who did not .\nThe study looked at a large number of adult patients who participated in the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics annual health survey between 2005 and 2015 .\nAbout 17.5 million people in the study had been diagnosed with depression and 58 percent of them had been prescribed an antidepressant .\nThe surveys tracked mental and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after a diagnosis of depression .\nMental health was assessed by asking about the participant \u2019 s ability to socialize , limitations of emotional problems , psychological distress , and general well-being .\nPhysical health was measured by looking at overall physical function , limitations , pain , energy levels , fatigue and general health status.14 After two years , participants who took antidepressants reported feeling no better than participants who did not take antidepressants .\nThe study \u2019 s lead author , Omar Almohammed , PhD , a professor of clinical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relying on the use of antidepressant medications , while underutilizing or underestimating the role and impact of non-therapeutic interventions.\n\u201d The recent study has even greater implications because antidepressant use surged around the globe during the COVID-19 pandemic .\nAt the start of the COVID pandemic between February and March 2020 , as lockdowns , masking and other social distancing restrictions were imposed , there was a 18.6 percent increase in the number of prescriptions filled for antidepressant medications in the U.S.15 In Israel , a June 2022 nationwide a data analysis study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antidepressants rose two percent per month over 11 months , whereas monthly fills for antidepressants prior to the COVID pandemic had been decreasing monthly .\nIn fact , there was a greater increase in antidepressant prescription fills In Israel during the COVD pandemic than during the Gaza War.16 Another study in the Friuli Venezia

8.3 million people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans took prescription medication for mental health and most of the prescriptions were for antidepressants.18 Symptoms of Depression in American Adults Triple During COVID Pandemic Many studies show that rates of depression have dramatically increased during the COVID pandemic .\nA study by Boston University School of Public Health compared data on

of 11 FDA panel members voting against its approval due to A\u03b2 drugs failing to show any benefit.3 Schrag \u2019 s own research also contradicted the research behind another A\u03b2

on Aug. 15 , 2022 shortly after discovering he had tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and developed symptoms of COVID-19.1 2 \u201c I guess you heard , this morning I tested positive for COVID .\nBut I \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSymptoms are mild and I really appreciate your inquires and concerns .\nBut I \u2019 m doing well , getting a lot of work done .\nGoing to continue to get it done and

and showing COVID symptoms.3 President Biden was prescribed Pfizer \u2019 s antiviral therapy Paxlovid , which is advertised as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAfter completion of the five-day regimen of Paxlovid , he tested positive again for SARS-CoV-2 several times and experienced a recurrence of COVID symptoms\u2014a phenomenon known as \u201c COVID-19 rebound \u201d ( or \u201c Paxlovid rebound \u201d ) .4 5 6 On June 15 , 2022 , the U.S. National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) issued a news release stating that Anthony Fauci , MD , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) and chief medical advisor to President Biden , had tested positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to the release : Dr. Fauci went on to take Paxlovid .\nHe experienced COVID-19 rebound and subsequently took a second round of Paxlovid before eventually testing negative for SARS-CoV-2.8 A lot of people still do not know that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) only required the vaccine manufacturers to demonstrate that COVID shots were at least 50 percent effective in preventing severe symptoms of disease , hospitalization and death , rather than preventing infection and transmission , which has always been the purpose of vaccination.9 Stoking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID shot would protect against getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 , President Biden confidently stated during a July 2021 CNN town hall meeting that , \u201c You \u2019 re not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.10 The Irony of Getting Four Shots and Still Getting COVID It is ironic that all three of these high-profile , influential players in the COVID saga\u2014Bourla , Biden and Fauci , who have consistently been promoting COVID vaccinations and have each gotten four shots\u2014have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and come down with COVID .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of them have gone out their way to put a positive spin on their common experience .\nRather than express a sense of frustration that , despite all those shots , they still managed to get infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and develop COVID , all three of these individuals actually emphasized the fact that they were fully vaccinated and boosted and doing well , implying that their wellness was directly due to all those shots .\n\u201c Mild symptoms \u201d being the operative phrase .\nBut how do they know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shots they got ?\nAfter all , there are vaccinated people who have suffered from severe COVID symptoms and been hospitalized , and even died .\nAnd there have been unvaccinated people who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 but never developed any COVID symptoms or only mild ones .\nIn the case of Bourla , the symptoms were \u201c very mild.\n\u201d In the case of President Biden , the symptoms were so mild that he was \u201c getting a lot of work done.\n\u201d No need to stay in bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were also so mild and the spin was that he would \u201c continue to work from his home.\n\u201d No need to do what sick people normally do and take it easy .\nIt \u2019 s also interesting to note that all three of these individuals opted to take Paxlovid .\nTwice , in Dr. Fauci \u2019 s case .\nBut why ?\nIsn \u2019 t the primary selling point of the COVID shots that they protect against serious COVID illness , hospitalization and death ?\nSome might say that prescribing Paxlovid indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOthers might argue that the antiviral drug simply provides an added measure of insurance against a really bad outcome from the \u201c breakthrough \u201d infection .\nOthers might just call it overkill , an act of desperation .\nThe Thankfulness Refrain from the COVID Vaxxed While there are similarities in the statements by Bourla , Biden and Fauci confirming their coronavirus infections and COVID conditions , they pale in comparison to the statements of other well-known Americans who were fully vaccinated and boosted for COVID .\nFor example , here \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The following is the statement from U.S .\nSenator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts : Here \u2019 s the statement from former First Lady and former U.S .\nSenator from New York Hillary Clinton : The statement from U.S .\nSenator Raphael Warnock of Georgia reads : I could go on and on .\nThere is no scarcity of nearly identical remarks from

U.S .\nSenator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut : The commonality is striking .\nIt \u2019 s almost as if they were auditioning for a role in a show and reading from the same script .\nDespite being fully vaccinated , fully boosted and fully infected , they were all doing fine and thankful to have gotten the shots .\nAll but one of them felt the need to market COVID products .\nA mere coincidence

FDA , but that rose to 66 percent by 1998 after its funding structure changed .\nNow , there are four pathways within the FDA which are designed to speed up drug approvals : Fast Track , Priority Review , Accelerated Approval , and Breakthrough Therapy designation .\nAs a result , the majority ( 68 percent ) of all new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these expedited pathways .\nWhile it has improved the availability of transformative drugs to patients who benefit from early access , the lower evidentiary standards for faster approvals have undoubtedly led to harm .\nA study focusing on drug safety found that following the introduction of PDUFA fees ( 1993-2004 ) there was a dramatic increase in drug withdrawals due to safety concerns in the U.S. , compared to the period before PDUFA funding ( 1971-1992 ) .\nThe researchers blamed changes in the \u201c regulatory culture \u201d at the FDA which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety signals .\nPut simply , the FDA \u2019 s standards for approving certain medicines became less stringent .\nConsequently , faster approvals have resulted in new drugs that are more likely to be withdrawn for safety reasons , more likely to carry a subsequent black-box warning , and more likely to have one or more dosages voluntarily discontinued by the manufacturer .\nFor accelerated drug approvals , the FDA accepts the use of surrogate outcomes ( like a lab test ) as a substitute for clinical outcomes .\nFor example , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccines in infants based on neutralizing antibody levels ( a surrogate outcome ) , rather than meaningful clinical benefits such as preventing serious COVID or hospitalization .\nAlso last year , the FDA approved an Alzheimer \u2019 s drug ( aducanumab ) based on lower \u03b2-amyloid protein levels ( again , a surrogate outcome ) rather than any clinical improvement for patients .\nOne FDA advisory member who resigned over the controversy said it was the \u201c worst drug approval decision in recent U.S. history.\n\u201d This lower standard of proof is becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that 44 percent of drugs approved between 2005-2012 were supported by ( inferior ) surrogate outcomes , but that rose to 60 percent between 2015-2017 .\nIt is a huge advantage to the drug industry because drug approvals may be based on fewer , smaller and less rigorous clinical trials .\nTraditionally , the FDA has required at least two \u2018 pivotal trials \u2019 for drug approval , which are typically phase III clinical trials with ~30,000 subjects intended to confirm the drug \u2019 s safety and efficacy .\nBut a recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported by two or more pivotal trials fell from 81 percent in 1995-1997 down to 53 percent by 2015-2017 .\nOther important design aspects of pivotal trials , such as \u201c double blinding \u201d fell from 80 percent in 1995-1997 down to 68 percent by 2015-2017 and \u201c randomization \u201d fell from 94 percent to 82 percent in that period .\nSimilarly , another study found that of the 49 novel therapeutics approved in 2020 , more than half ( 57 percent ) were on the basis of a single pivotal trial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ component , and almost 40 percent were not double-blinded .\nFollowing an accelerated approval , the FDA allows drugs onto the market before efficacy has been proven .\nA condition of the accelerated approval is that manufacturers must agree to conduct \u201c post authorization \u201d studies ( or phase IV confirmatory trials ) to confirm the anticipated benefits of the drug .\nIf it turns out that there is no benefit , the drug \u2019 s approval can be cancelled .\nUnfortunately though , many confirmatory trials are never run , or they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confirm the drug is beneficial .\nIn response , the FDA rarely imposes sanctions on companies for failing to adhere to the rules , drugs are rarely withdrawn and when penalties are applied , they are minimal .\nThe FDA thinks its main problem is \u2018 public messaging \u2019 so the agency is reportedly seeking a media-savvy public health expert to better articulate its messaging going forward .\nBut the FDA \u2019 s problems run deeper than that .\nA recent Government Accountability Office report revealed FDA staff ( and other federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political interference in their work due to fear of retaliation and uncertainty about how to report such incidents .\nOver the course of the pandemic , employees \u201c felt that the potential political interference they observed resulted in the alteration or suppression of scientific findings\u2026 [ and ] may have resulted in the politically motivated alteration of public health guidance or delayed publication of covid-19-related scientific findings.\n\u201d Political interference has compounded an already problematic interference by the drug industry .\nThe policy changes enacted since the 1992 PDUFA fees , have slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are concerned its decisions about drug approvals have prioritized corporate interests over public health .\nIndependent experts now say the declining evidentiary standards , shortening approval times , and increasing industry involvement in FDA decision-making , has

Profiting from Increases in Autism", "content": "It is no secret that there have been significant increases in the development of autism among children in the U.S. over the past three decades .\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) acknowledges that , today , at least one in 44 eight-year-old children have been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) 1 and some autism prevalence estimates are higher.2 In addition to the high costs to families raising children with autism,3 the autism epidemic is becoming a big business opportunity for corporations .\nAbout 10 years ago , states began mandating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ABA ) therapy for children diagnosed with ASD .\nThis led to a boom in ABA service across the country,4 and insurance companies were forced to cover the cost of ABA therapy because it is the only treatment option that is government approved for doctors to prescribe and treat children with autism.5 For some families , ABA therapy is the only way their autistic children will receive any type of treatment.6 ABA focuses on behavior modification by rewarding certain \u201c good \u201d behaviors and punishing \u201c bad \u201d behaviors with the hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This type of behavioral modification can only be taught by professionals trained in the ABA technique .\nThe Demand for Applied Behavioral Analysis Therapy is Growing The profit to be made in the ABA therapy market has been realized by private equity firms as they began investing in and buying up ABA centers across the country in recent years .\nIn 2017 , Coker Capital Advisors projected that community-based ABA providers could earn $ 10 billion and school-based providers could earn $ 7 billion in annual revenue.7 In 2018 , the Center for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blackstone for approximately $ 700 million and , in 2019 , Rothschild acquired New England ABA .\nIn 2019 , Patrick Krause , co-head of health care services for MHT Partners , a private equity firm in Dallas , said : Michael Maloney , president and CEO of Learn Behavioral , an ABA provider purchased by the private equity group LLR Partners in 2016 , estimated that ABA therapy generates between $ 15 and $ 80 billion dollars each year based on estimated by the CDC.9 In 2019 , TPG Capital , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm committed $ 300 million of equity capital to Kadiant , a company offering ABA and related therapy to children with ASD.10 Katherine Wood of TPG Capital said : Does Private Equity Funding Help or Hurt Children with ASD ?\nMany parents find fault with the ABA model of therapy , especially after so many private equity firms have heavily invested in the field .\nComplaints about private equity backed ABA therapy point to the poor quality of treatment , including therapists using cookie-cutter templates to treat all children regardless of ability ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of therapy ; high turn-over rate of therapists , and ABA provider shortages.12 Some ABA providers disagree with the critics claiming that they personally make decisions about how many hours of therapy a child needs , not private equity firms , and that each child \u2019 s care is individualized.13 ABA therapy is supposed to conduct an assessment before the start of therapy to determine each individual child \u2019 s needs , abilities and goals .\nHowever , whistleblowers in the industry argue that the therapy centers funded by private equity firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment plans and goals with multiple children , regardless of a individual child \u2019 s ability .\nThe maximum number of hours are being pushed on these children by private equity firm owners without considering other aspects of the child \u2019 s life , such as other types of therapy , school and family life .\nABA providers have been caught submitting more treatment hours than there are in a day\u2014in one case logging in 65 hours in a day\u2014which prompted a federal watchdog agency to take notice.14 Eric Larsson , executive director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ABA center that is not funded by private equity , emphasized the importance of individualized care when he said : As the private equity industry takes over the ABA market , the industry has seen a high ABA provider turn-over rate , which has a negative effect on children with ASD who depend upon and thrive with consistency .\nABA therapists are not required to have extensive schooling or training .\nThe only requirement is that they be at least 18 years old , have a high school diploma , undergo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test in order to administer ABA therapy.16 \u201c This is like a full-time job for a young child .\nIt \u2019 s shocking to me that without any science , 40 hours per week has become the standard in some places , \u201d said Zoe Gross , director of advocacy for the nonprofit Autistic Self Advocacy Network.17 Other parents have a different view and are grateful that private equity firms have made it possible for ABA programs to be expanded and offered in many more locations .\nWithout the funding , they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their children.18 Thomas Frazier of Autism Speaks offered a more optimistic point of view about private equity firms financially investing in ABA services .\nHe said : Hopebridge is one example of an ABA center that was able to expand into other states and open a number of new clinics with a sizable investment from Baird Capital in 2018 .\nDennis May , chief executive director of Hopebridge , explained that the company is managing its growth responsibility and is keeping its standards consistent using uniform training and technology .\nHe said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over by the private equity firm Arsenol Capital Partners for a reported investment of between $ 100-500 million , giving the ABA therapy center a valuation

to an Amicus brief in a lawsuit urging the federal Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to halt the U.S. government \u2019 s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for military personnel.1 The lawsuit was filed by 35 Navy personnel requesting religious exemption to the COVID-19 vaccine mandate .\nA temporary stay was issued by the District Court of the Northern District of Texas Fort Worth blocking the Navy from declaring that the Navy Seals , who filed for a religious exemption to COVID vaccination , are non-deployable and disqualified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discharged from service .\nThe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the temporary injunction , but the U.S. Supreme Court partially reversed the decision in April 2022 .\nThe Supreme Court ruling allows the Navy to consider the vaccination status of Seals when making deployment assignment and other operational decisions while the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals further considers the Navy \u2019 s position that military personnel filing a religious vaccine exemption should be subject to discipline and discharge from the service.2 In a press release , Miyares pointed out that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members who submitted a religious exemption have been approved.3 Meanwhile , data from the Department of Defense ( DoD ) shows that there were only 17 deaths and 1 hospitalization out of the 105,277 cases of COVID in the Navy.4 In this case , the Biden administration wants the court to grant the military deference in an attempt to have military service personnel comply with the COVID vaccination mandate , even if measures taken to ensure compliance erodes personal freedoms .\nTwenty-two Attorneys General collectively have signed the amicus brief arguing that states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom during the COVID pandemic and the Biden administration \u2019 s demand for deference to the military \u2019 s vaccine mandate should be met with skepticism .\nThe 22-state coalition of Attorneys General opposing the military \u2019 s COVID vaccine mandate by filing the amicus brief include Virginia , West Virginia , Texas , Utah and Wyoming , South Carolina , Oklahoma , Tennessee , Nebraska , Missouri , Montana , New Hampshire , Alabama , Alaska , Arizona , Arkansas , Louisiana , Kansas , Kentucky , Indiana and Florida.6 This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General has been outspoken about his opposition of vaccine mandates .\nJust two weeks after he took

Still Pushing Coerced Jabs", "content": "Opinion | Medical ethics is about protecting society from medical malfeasance and the self-interest of the humans whom we trust to manage health .\nIt is therefore disturbing when prominent people , in a prominent journal , tear up the concept of medical ethics and human rights norms .\nIt is worse when they ignore broad swathes of evidence , and misrepresent their own sources to do so .\nOn July 8th 2022 , The Lancet published a \u2018 Viewpoint \u2019 article online : \u201c Effectiveness of vaccination mandates in improving uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in the USA.\n\u201d The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vaccine mandates , primarily concludes that coercing people to take a medical product , and reducing options for refusal , increases product uptake .\nIt further concludes that the best way to implement such mandates is for employers and educational institutions to threaten job security and the right to education .\nThe use of coercion goes against the established ethics and morals of Public Health , and could be argued to be anti-health .\nIn this case , the article justifies it by stating that \u201c the current evidence regarding the safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support mandates.\n\u201d However , it offers scant evidence to back this assertion , and ignores all evidence to the contrary .\nThey apparently consider the ability to work and support a family , or gain formal education , as something that is to be granted or taken away , not a human right .\nThe Lancet was once a credible journal with a rigorous policy of peer review .\nHowever , in this article it appears to have dropped its former standards , promoting medical fascism ( coercion , threat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without insisting on a rigorous evidence base to justify such an approach .\nThis suggests an attempt to normalize such approaches in mainstream public health .\nPast experience has shown us where fascism behind a fa\u00e7ade of public health can lead .\nThe sterilization campaigns aimed at colored and low-income populations of the U.S. Eugenicist era , and the extensions of similar programs under Nazism in 1930s and 1940s Europe , relied heavily on the normalization of such approaches .\nLeading public health voices from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanitizing populations rather than environments , encouraging the idea of a tiered society where health \u2018 experts \u2019 determine the rights and medical management of those deemed less worthy .\nThe authors of this Lancet paper , ranging from academics and medical consultants to the daughter of a prominent politician , attempt to rewrite human rights in medicine as if precedent never existed .\nTheir argument for coercion in mass vaccination recognizes that \u2018 vaccine mandates , \u2019 whether issued by governments , employers or schools , all involve a loss of rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide a medical justification for mass vaccination with a non-transmission-blocking vaccine .\nThe paper focuses on the premise that coercion , commonly considered a form of force , makes humans do things they would not otherwise do .\nBanning fellow humans from making their own health choices on pain of loss of normal participation in society has an impact on increasing vaccine uptake .\nThis is hardly a revelation to any thinking human , but clearly important enough to justify publication in The Lancet .\nThe article links to evidence of vaccine mandates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher compliance when the right of religious and personal belief exemption is removed , or where onerous requirements for exemptions are put in place .\nLeaving ethical questions aside , the obvious lack of similarity between the authors \u2019 predicate childhood vaccinations that block transmission and COVID-19 vaccines that have minimal impact on transmission , and may even promote it , is ignored .\nThe one mandated adult vaccine predicate referenced in the article , the influenza vaccine , provides only a 2.5 percent reduction in pneumonia \u2018 when the ( mandated ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 in the reference quoted .\nWhen raising the sacking of non-vaccinated workers , the authors seem comfortable with the approach but coy in admitting its consequences .\nTheir admission that \u201c a few large U.S. employers have terminated hundreds of workers for non-compliance references an article in Money magazine which actually paints a bleaker picture , characterizing it as a \u2018 great resignation.\n\u2019 The authors will also have been aware of mass layoffs by large employers such as New York City ( over 9,000 sacked or placed on leave ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , which sacked 3,400 , Kaiser Permanente ( laid off 2,200 ) , and the tens of thousands of staff lost from the U.K. care-home sector .\nExtrapolated across countries and society to actually provide credible data may have been too uncomfortable for the authors and Lancet editors .\nHigh efficacy and safety are an obvious ( though on their own , insufficient ) prerequisite for any mandated product .\nThis entire area of safety is dealt with by stating ; \u201c The current evidence on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d supported by a single study comparing vaccinated individuals 1-3 weeks and 3-6 weeks post-vaccination , revealing low levels of myocardial infarction , appendicitis and stroke .\nThe claim that \u201c widespread administration in adults has quickly generated a large evidence base supporting the vaccines \u2019 safety , including evidence from active surveillance studies \u201d suggests that both the authors and The Lancet are unaware of the VAERS and Eudravigilance databases set up for exactly this purpose .\nNo mention is made of growing data on myocarditis , menstrual irregularities , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccinated groups in the Pfizer randomised control trials on which the FDA emergency registration was based .\nWere The Lancet \u2019 s reviewers unaware of these sources ?\nThe sole reference to vaccine efficacy discusses COVID-19 ventilated patient outcomes , It ignores the period to 14 days post-previous dose that Pfizer acknowledges can be associated with immune suppression .\nFenton et al .\nhave noted that classing a vaccinated person as unvaccinated in the first 14 days post-injection has profound impacts on vaccine effectiveness data .\nPost-infection immunity in the unvaccinated is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors disingenuously state that \u201c evidence suggests that the immunity produced by natural infection varies by individual , and that people with previous infection benefit from vaccination .\nNew variants further undercut the case for adequacy of previous infection .\nTwo references are used here : one from a study in Qatar and the other a study from Kentucky .\nThe Qatar study finds that \u201c the protection of previous infection against hospitalization or death caused by reinfection appeared to be robust , regardless of variant , \u201d whilst the Kentucky study found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 2-month period in the months soon after vaccination , prior to the waning and then reversal of this protection as demonstrated in studies of longer duration elsewhere .\nThe vast breadth of evidence on relative effectiveness of post-infection immunity is ignored .\nEither the authors failed to read their references and are unaware of waning and of the vast literature on post-infection immunity , or they do not consider demonstration of efficacy important for coerced medical treatments .\nIn a previous era , or in a previously credible medical journal , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedure would have required very high standards of evidence of efficacy and safety .\nIt is arguing for the abrogation of fundamental principles such as informed consent that are at the core of modern medical ethics .\nFailure to address well-known contrary data should prevent an article from even reaching the peer-review stage .\nWe are left with a paper stating that coercion is a good path to increase compliance for a product that does not reduce community infection risk , and has potentially serious side effects .\nIgnoring both of these aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to justifying mass vaccination .\nThe sole nod to any human rights concern\u2014 \u201c Some objectors argue mandates represent undue encroachment on individual liberty \u201d \u2014is an interesting way to characterize removal of the right to income , education and the ability to socialize with others .\nAlthough all these rights are recognized under the Universal Declaration for Human Rights , the authors and The Lancet consider them insufficiently serious to dwell upon .\nPublic health has been down this road before .\nWe have seen the path society takes when basic public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim that some perceive as \u2018 good.\n\u2019 We have also seen how most health professionals will comply , however horrific the actions involved .\nThere is no reason to believe that this round of medical fascism will end differently .\nWe rely on medical journals such as The Lancet to apply at least the same standards to the purveyors of such doctrines as they do to others and demand a rational and honest evidence base .\nAnything less would raise legitimate questions as to the role the journal is taking in promoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free , evidence-based and rights-respecting society .\nNote : This commentary provides referenced information and perspective on a topic related to vaccine science , policy , law or ethics being discussed in public forums and by U.S. lawmakers .\nThe websites of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (

by David Feshbach that recently appeared in Barron \u2019 s financial magazine\u2026 \u201c Autism Can Be a Growth Market , if Investors Help Scale It Up.\n\u201d Clearly , there is an expectation that the autism epidemic of the past 30-plus years will continue to grow and , consequently , so will the opportunities for businesses that provide treatments ( mostly drugs ) for those affected by this neurological disorder.1 2 According to a market analysis and forecast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insights , the global autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) treatment market was valued at $ 1.85 billion in 2021 .\nThis market is projected to grow from $ 1.93 billion in 2022 to $ 3.17 billion by 2029 , with an estimated compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of 7.4 percent over the next 7-8 years.1 2 3 Despite the considerable size of the ASD market , Feshbach , who is CEO of an autism technologies nonprofit , believes the market is \u201c still in its infancy.\n\u201d He adds : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentions market \u201c potential \u201d is the value of services to aid in dealing with autism , along with the research needed to develop technologies and medical interventions to \u201c improve the quality of life \u201d for autism families and , ultimately , the production and deployment of those technologies and interventions .\nThe study in Fortune Business Insights notes some of the technologies and medical interventions to which Feshbach may be referring\u2026 \u201c antipsychotic drugs , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs , stimulants , sleep medications , and others.\n\u201d Essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Investment in Autism Industry Feshbach believes there is a need for greater investment in companies working on innovative treatments for autism .\nBut he points out that the \u201c good news \u201d is that \u201c investors are , at last , recognizing that autism is a growth market.\n\u201d 1 2 He writes : The \u201c bad news , \u201d Feshbach says , is that much of the investment is going to develop services and treatments that can not be produced and marketed on a large scale and so , consequently , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for services and treatments is diverse and complex , making it hard to judge where best to make investments.1 2 \u201c In many ways , the complexity of the autism market reflects the disorder itself , \u201d Feshbach says .\n\u201c It is

child communicate ?\nHow can my child get a job ?\nWho will care for my child after I pass ?\n\u201d 1 2 But there is a more fundamental question that many parents of autistic children ask , and that is , \u201c How did my child get autism ?\n\u201d More specifically , \u201c How was my child completely normal and healthy one moment and then , suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feshbach neglected to list this question is interesting but not surprising , because there are no good answers for it and , thus , no services or treatments to invest in .\nPart of the problem is that the question is often phrased like this : In her groundbreaking 1985 book DPT : A Shot in the Dark , which she co-authored with medical historian Harris L. Coulter , Barbara Loe Fisher , co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center ( NVIC ) , wrote : Fisher gave the following experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one : I have always felt it was the shot , because her convulsion came just one hour after it .\nBut no doctor would admit it .\nI would go to a hospital , and she would be having something wrong , and I would tell them her story ,

autism.\n\u201d There can never be credible scientific investigations that find answers for why children develop autism so long as most scientists and medical professionals refuse to seriously consider all possibilities .\nCiting some epidemiological studies that suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors and public health officials have closed the book on the vaccine-autism connection and declared the science to be settled on that topic , despite the fact that there have been other biological mechanism and epidemiological studies that suggested a link.6 7 Curiously , most doctors and public health officials have largely dismissed the weight of countless clinical observations that suggest a link .\nFisher rightly asks , \u201c How can the medical establishment evaluate vaccine reactions if no one is willing to sit down and observe them ?\n\u201d She adds : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is\u2026 We don \u2019 t know what causes autism , but rest assured we \u2019 re going to invest lots of money to deal with it .\nIn other words , we \u2019 re going to create an even bigger autism industry than we already have while ignoring potential causes of the disorder that drives it .\nIf you would like to

misrepresentation of prior knowledge , and disregard for diversity of scientific evidence and opinion does not reflect well on either The Lancet or the commission itself .\nMedicine and public health are particularly dependent on truth and transparency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be entrusted to dogma and superstition .\nClear and open debate is fundamental to minimizing mistakes , which can kill , and to building the trust that patients and populations need to follow guidance ( as they must ultimately be the decision-makers ) .\nThese two related disciplines are also increasingly lucrative for

the other hand , could mean admitting certain highly profitable drugs are not needed or even dangerous ; that an alternative safe and cheap drug , previously available for other purposes , will be

that puts their own investments at risk , they would be betraying their investors .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors , is overemphasize the advantage of their own product , maximize the desire of people to use them , and run public campaigns to ensure this situation is prolonged as far as possible .\nThis is what any for-profit business does\u2014it is their job .\nIt is not unexpected .\nWe have long relied on medical journals to act as a conduit for information from researchers to medical practitioners and the public .\nThis is a plausible model if journals are independent and the staff and owners of the journal promote truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was once the case ; The Lancet , a subject of this article , was once family-owned and that could hold to the values of Thomas Wakley and his descendants , standing against medical authorities up to 1921 .\nIt has since been owned by other for-profit companies , now a subsidiary of a larger Dutch-based publishing conglomerate , \u2018 Elsevier.\n\u2019 Elsevier in turn is owned by RELX group ( back in London ) , a large company with a typical list of major institutional investors including BlackRock ( and so its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bank of America\u2014the same list as major pharmaceutical and biotech corporations whose products The Lancet publishes on .\nThe above does not tell us there is intentional wrong or malfeasance , just intrinsic conflicts of interest of the type journals such as The Lancet are supposed to guard against .\nThe Lancet \u2019 s ultimate ownership has a duty to shareholders to use their portfolio of assets to maximize return ; on this measure alone The Lancet should favor certain pharmaceutical companies .\nThe only thing that could stand in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a moral code that rates investors below integrity .\nIn this context , The Lancet \u2019 s track record over COVID-19 has been checkered .\nIn February 2020 it published a major letter on COVID-19 origins that ignored major conflicts of interest in which nearly all authors were implicated in the alternative lab origin hypothesis .\nIt published clearly fraudulent data on hydroxychloroquine that were significant in halting early treatment studies .\nA lack of early effective treatment was necessary to secure Pharma profits for later COVID-19 medications and vaccines .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequently described by The Guardian and was one of the biggest retractions in modern history .\nIn 2022 , The Lancet published a weakly-evidenced opinion advocating medical fascism ; dividing and restricting people based on compliance with pharmaceutical interventions .\nThe Lancet \u2019 s top leadership has remained unchanged throughout .\nThis is relevant context for understanding the report of The Lancet \u2018 commission \u2019 on COVID-19 .\nIn mid-2020 , The Lancet recruited people from various aspects of public life to review various aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak .\nThis \u2018 commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a privately-convened group from a private for-profit business ) was headed by economist Jeffrey Sachs , who preceded the recent release of the report by publicly discussing conclusions on the potential source of SARS-CoV-2 , highlighting the probability of a laboratory origin as opposed to direct animal-human spread .\nThis part of the commission \u2019 s investigation had been halted early when Sachs discovered that several panel members had undisclosed conflicts of interest amounting to receipt of funding to conduct the very laboratory gain-of-function research widely suspected of promoting rapid human spread .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lancet origins letter .\nThe Executive Summary provides a foretaste of the quality of work to come , noting IHME estimates of \u201c 17\u00b72 million estimated deaths from COVID-19 , \u201d a \u201c staggering death toll \u201d as the commission notes , particularly staggering as it is higher than the World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimates for total excess deaths throughout the pandemic period .\nThese WHO estimates include all deaths caused by lockdowns and those where virus detection was incidental .\nIt is an implausible figure , even ignoring the lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late old age , and with severe comorbidities ) .\nIronically , the commission reports in its main text over 2.1 million excess deaths from malaria , tuberculosis and HIV arising from the COVID-19 response in 2020 alone .\nHowever , this is a misunderstanding by commission members of WHO \u2019 s actual estimates\u2014WHO does report significant excess 2020 deaths from these diseases but not this many\u2014though many more will accumulate through subsequent years .\nReflecting the lack of inclusiveness of the commission itself , the report recommends censorship of the alternate approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disinformation \u201d to be a contributor to severity .\nThe commission then inadvertently provides an example of disinformation in its characterization of the Great Barrington Declaration , misrepresenting it as calling for \u201c uncontrolled spread of the virus.\n\u201d This , based on the declaration itself , must be a lie , as the commission must not have read the declaration within the two years they had available .\nDid they not consider it pertinent to question those who wrote it or ( over 900,000 ) signed it ?\nWhether the declaration was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHO evidence-based policy .\nIgnoring this is simply untenable for a serious inquiry .\nThe overall findings of the commission are extremely disappointing from the point of view of science , public health , and simple honesty .\nIts apparent lack of familiarity with prior public health norms and practice , including that of the WHO , may have been genuine , or may be contrived to emphasize a narrative it was intended to support .\nGiven The Lancet \u2019 s COVID-19 track record and business imperatives , the latter would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see adults in positions of influence producing a document of this nature .\nThe Report helpfully provides a three page \u2018 Key Findings \u2019 section .\nWhile missing aspects of the main body such as the euphemism \u201c prosocial behaviour \u201d to denote social exclusion , and extolling the \u201c logic \u201d of the completely illogical WHO slogan for mass COVID-19 vaccination , \u201c No one is safe until everyone is safe , \u201d it generally captures the main thrust of the whole text .\nReading the rest is however recommended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so clearly gone off the rails .\nThe key findings are stepped through here .\nAnyone with a public health background is encouraged to refute the concerns raised , as many of the commission \u2019 s assertions appear to involve common traps that seem inexcusable for public health professionals .\nThey hang heavily on a failure to grasp three fundamentals of COVID-19 and public health : \u2022 Public health interventions are about risk and benefit .\nInterventions have positive and negative impacts .\nRecommendations therefore can not be given without considering the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and long term , weighing these against perceived benefits .\n\u2022 COVID-19 mortality is highly skewed towards very old age , and heavily associated with comorbidities .\nTherefore it is imperative to consider COVID-19 disease burden relative to other diseases in terms of life-years lost , not raw mortality ( from or with ) COVID-19 .\n\u2022 Prolonged lockdowns , workplace and school closures were not part of prior policy , or were partially recommended only in far more severe outbreaks .\nThis is not implying the interventions were good or bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defied public health norms and prior evidence .\nThey were recommended against due to the harm they potentially cause .\nThis lands most heavily , as WHO notes , on low income people and populations .\nThe commission seems unaware of the prior WHO pandemic influenza guideline .\nIt is not among their 499 references .\nWHO specifically warned against restricting travel in this guideline , also noting that evidence on facemasks is \u201c weak.\n\u201d Travel restrictions can be significantly harmful to economies\u2014cutting tourism income alone in low-income countries can increase mortality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention costs that extending these response measures would impose .\nWhere lockdown costs are mentioned at all , it is in the context of costs of \u2018 failure \u2019 to implement earlier or heavier , never in terms of weighing harm avoided against that caused .\nIgnoring relative costs , including the long-term health costs of increased poverty from longer lockdowns , is anathema to good public health policy .\nMetanalyses of randomized control trials of community masking do not show significant benefit , and trials during COVID-19 show similar results .\nAt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when recommending against community-masking\u2014the organization is yet to provide evidence to back its later endorsement of their widespread use .\nThe Lancet commission appears to be specifically recommending against the use of evidence-based approaches .\nMost people live in low and middle income countries with low COVID-19 mortality and far higher burdens from other infectious disease , which occur in far younger people .\nThis statement therefore seems strangely Western-centric .\nIf they had known earlier , what would countries have actually done ?\n( if earlier implementation of poverty-inducing responses , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears unaware of serological evidence of spread prior to January 2020 , in some cases backed by PCR .\nThis would negate any benefit from this recommendation , even ignoring the harms .\nCiting the Western Pacific Region as an example of \u2018 lockdowns working \u2019 similarly makes little sense , as comparisons elsewhere ( e.g .\nEurope ) did not show significant benefit , while in crowded slum areas they are clearly pointless .\nEvidence of early wide transmission ( e.g Japan ) indicates that low mortality was due to other factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf the commission members have experience in public health , they know that quarantine of healthy people , prolonged \u2018 distancing \u2019 and workplace closures were never used at scale before , and that widespread lockdowns were not \u2018 routine public health and social measures.\n\u2019 If they did not know this , they had two years to find out .\nThe world , including The Lancet , knew by March 2020 that COVID-19 overwhelmingly targets the elderly and has little impact on healthy working-age adults .\nThe vaccines do not significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show high transmission\u2014so to suggest low vaccination hindered epidemic control is a vacuous statement .\nIt may seem intuitive ( e.g .\nit occurs with some other vaccines ) but the commission had 18 months to observe COVID-19 mass vaccination .\nThis is an extraordinary statement to use regarding COVID-19 .\nMany Western governments have openly employed behavioral psychology in an unprecedented way in the COVID-19 outbreak .\nNo public health campaign has ever gained such media attention or had such uniform suppression of non-official messaging from media outlets .\nIt is strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality .\nThis appears to be a nod to compassion for vulnerable populations .\nIt is true that certain groups did suffer higher rates of severe COVID-19 , though these are highly correlated with rates of comorbidities ( obesity in Western countries is unfortunately associated with poverty , and poverty with certain ethnic groups ) .\nHowever , the burden was overwhelmingly on the elderly\u2014to a rate several thousand times that in young people .\nIt is the response that burdened these groups most clearly and the report does mention inequity-driving school closures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apparent blind support for faster and harder lockdowns .\nThis claim appears false .\nSub-Saharan African countries did well irrespective of prior experience , with a relative exception of South Africa where obesity is more prevalent and there is a higher proportion of old people .\nTanzania instituted very few COVID-19 specific measures but has similar outcomes .\nMore than half the sub-Saharan population is less than 20 years of age , an age-group with extremely low mortality in the West .\nActual spread in Africa , confirmed by WHO , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in low and middle income countries ( except perhaps China ) will by now have immunity .\nPost-infection immunity is equal or more effective to vaccine-induced immunity .\nTherefore , mass vaccination of a whole population with COVID-19 vaccines that don \u2019 t significantly reduce transmission can not

COVID-19 pandemic in 2019-2020 , there was a mysterious polio-like syndrome emerging among some children in the United States , as well as other countries such as India , called acute flaccid myelitis ( AFM ) \u2014also sometimes referred to as acute flaccid paralysis ( AFP ) .\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) began tracking cases of AFM in August 2014.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 One hundred twenty confirmed cases of AFM were reported in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases in 2015 , 153 in 2016 , 38 in 2017 , 233 in 2018 , 47 in 2019 , 33 in 2020 , 28 in 2021 and 22 as Oct. 12 , 2022 .\nUsually , cases of AFM tend to spike upward during August-November.15 16 During the past three years , the attention given to AFM by public health officials and the media has been eclipsed by COVID , but the neurological condition which produces paralysis mostly in young children appears to be back on the radar screen .\nAFM in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2022 , NBC News published an article titled \u201c Virus associated with polio-like muscle weakness is spreading among kids , CDC warns \u201d highlighting a CDC report confirming 260 cases of a virus known as \u201c enterovirus D68 \u201d ( EV-D68 ) in children in the U.S. from Mar .\n1 through Sept. 20 , which allegedly is linked to AFM .\nOn Sept. 14 , a similar article titled \u201c A virus that causes polio-like symptoms is spreading among children , CDC warns \u201d was published by Salon .\nThose articles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cues from the summary of the CDC report that states that EV-D68 \u201c caused biennial outbreaks of severe respiratory illness and acute flaccid myelitis.\n\u201d 17 18 19 Both the titles of the NBC and Salon articles and the intro to the CDC report leave the impression that EV-D68 has been confirmed to be the main cause of the AFM outbreaks in the U.S. since 2014 .\nIt \u2019 s important to understand , however , that a causal relationship between EV-D68 and AFM has not been scientifically established .\nThe CDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been confirmed as the cause of AFM .\nIt states : The Connection Between EV-D68 and AFM is Speculative The most that can be said is that EV-D68 is suspected of being a possible cause of AFM .\nThis is based on tests conducted by the CDC in which a \u201c small number of patients with AFM \u201d were found to have \u201c coxsackievirus A16 , EV-A71 , and EV-D68 \u201d in their spinal fluid.18 In a June 2019 update by the CDC on its investigation into the cause of AFM , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 99 percent of the individuals confirmed to have had AFM as of June 2019 did not have EV-D68 or any other infectious microbe detected in their spinal fluid .\nConsequently , the most that could be surmised is that there may be an association between one or more of those three viruses in a very small number of the children found to have symptoms of AFM .\nThere was no confirmation of causation or even correlation , which would mean identifying some sort of pattern or trend .\nIn a STAT article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed on the lack of scientific evidence with regard to EV-D68 .\nShe wrote : Infectious disease physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security Amesh Adalja came to the same the conclusion .\nHe said : A study published in the journal of Emerging Infectious Diseases in October 2020 noted : Areas of uncertainty remain .\nYou do not have to be adept at reading between the lines to figure out what they \u2019 re saying here .\nAnd yet , despite the lack of scientific evidence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be a kind of nuanced push by the CDC to solidify this link .\nIt is a jump to conclusion that is more brazenly promoted by the media because , once a virus is identified as the culprit , then the quest to develop yet another vaccine to give to children can get underway .\nBut hold on , why even bother to wait for the scientific evidence to blame EV-D68 for AFM ?\nWhy not just assume a causal relationship and move forward with development of an EV-D68 vaccine for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Firm to Develop Vaccine for AFM That was probably the thinking at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) in 2020 when it awarded pharmaceutical company Intravacc BV of The Netherlands a contract ( No .\n75N93020C00037 ) that may end up totaling $ 9.4 million to develop a vaccine for EV-D68 .\nIn a press release , Intravacc said it would develop an \u201c inactivated \u201d EV D68 vaccine , based on its \u201c proprietary Vero cell technology , from early product selection through to Phase I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratified to enter into this co-development contract with the NIH/NIAID for an inactivated EV-D68 vaccine to protect children from AFM in foreseen EV-D68

developing \u201c inactivated whole virus vaccines for emergency viral diseases.\n\u201d The study noted : It appears that NIAID and its director Dr. Anthony Fauci may be aiming to fast-track an

\u201c contemporary scientific consensus \u201d and can be deemed \u201c misinformation \u201d or \u201c disinformation \u201d by the California Medical Board or California Osteopathic Board .\nAssembly Bill 2098 was sponsored by State Senator Richard Pan , a pediatrician , and signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on September 30 , 2022 .\nIt is scheduled to go into effect Jan. 1 , 2023 , and allows doctors to be charged with unprofessional conduct and put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or be suspended and lose their medical license.1 2 3 4 The California Medical Board and California Osteopath Board will have the authority to investigate and adjudicate claims that a doctor violated the law.5 If a physician is found to have departed from the government approved \u201c standard of care \u201d policy related to COVID-19 , one of the California medical boards could revoke his or her medical license.6 COVID Standard of Care Policies Have Frequently Changed Over Time The government , employers , schools , colleges and universities have often changed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past three years , which demonstrates that the government \u2019 s position on COVID-19 facts and policies changes and what is considered \u201c standard of care \u201d may be true one day but not be true the next .\nEven so , doctors in California who dissent from the government \u2019 s official positions on COVID-19 prevention and treatment could lose their career for using their best professional judgement in caring for their patients.7 Highlighting that the bill is another attempt to eliminate the free speech , lawyer Jonathan Turley said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current government backed \u201c contemporary scientific consensus \u201d is the only medical advice that a doctor should be allowed to share with their patients about the ever-evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus , whether or not that \u201c scientific consensus \u201d evolves over time or current government policy is considered by a doctor to place a patient at risk because , for example , it is contraindicated by the individual \u2019 s medical history.9 Even staunch supporters of the COVID shots and mask-wearing have expressed concern with this new law censoring doctor \u2019 s private conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eric Widera , MD , professor of medicine at the University of California , San Francisco warned : Newsom Signs Assembly Bill 2098 Into Law Claiming It is \u201c Narrowly Tailored \u201d On Sept. 30 , Gov .\nNewsom signed the bill into law stating : Gov .\nNewsom defended his actions claiming that the bill

mentioned anywhere in the text of the law .\nPerhaps that is because it is egregious to assume that a doctor , who shares a professional opinion about what would be in a patient \u2019 s best interest based on the individual \u2019 s medical history , is doing that with \u201c malicious intent.\n\u201d Apparently , the California Medical Board plans to decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional behavior that requires punishment after receiving a complaint that a physician has disseminated \u201c misinformation \u201d or \u201c disinformation \u201d related to COVID-19 to a patient.15 According to California Medical Board spokesman Carlos Villatoro , when a complaint is received , the Board\u2026 Since decisions will be made by California medical licensing boards based on facts and circumstances at the time of the complaint , doctors may unwittingly put their license on the line when they treat patients using their best professional judgement.17 Dr. Pan said that he proposed the bill to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who founded America \u2019 s Frontline Doctors during the pandemic and formerly practiced in Beverly Hills , from providing patients with what he termed \u201c misinformation \u201d about COVID-19 .\nDr. Pan led the effort to remove the personal belief vaccine exemption from California public health laws in 2015 and , in describing this law , ominously said : Dr. Pan \u2019 s statement raises two serious issues .\nFirst , it appears that he believes patients should only be allowed to receive COVID information and make \u201c appropriate decisions \u201d about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California Medical Board are the arbitrators of what constitutes an \u201c appropriate decision.\n\u201d In addition , the law does not speak about intention .\nIf intention is not a component of the law , how can the California Medical Board infer or take a physician \u2019 s intention into consideration when doling out punishment ?\nPhysician Critics of the New Law Speak Out Jay Bhattacharya , MD , epidemiologist and professor of Health Policy at Stanford University Medical School wrote an article warning : Dr. Bhattacharya points out that doctors have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their individual needs and health history .\nThis law contradicts that principle by requiring doctors to act as agents of the state , who are only allowed to repeat what some characterize as \u201c scientific consensus \u201d but others may characterize as government backed propaganda.20 Legally , doctors owe a duty of care to their patients .\nThis duty of care extends to warning and advising patients of the benefits , risks and side effects of taking a medication or biological and allowing the patient to make an informed , voluntary decision about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which supports the informed consent principle.21 When doctors are prevented from informing patients about the inherent risks of taking a novel vaccine or a drug that could potentially cause harm based on an individual \u2019 s health history , or a doctor is too afraid to say anything at all out of fear of being prosecuted for professional misconduct and losing the right to practice , it seems doubtful that this

COVID pandemic .\nConsider , for example , Pfizer \u2019 s and Moderna \u2019 s mRNA vaccines .\nHow successful was this technology in its first large-scale trial run in humans ?\nA useful metric to cut through a lot of statistical noise is all-cause mortality .\nWe can argue about the causes of death .\nDid this person die with COVID or from COVID ?\nWas this fatality a vaccine side effect or a random temporal association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body count .\nIt is hard to spin death certificates .\nA recent preprint study in the medical journal The Lancet found that the mRNA vaccines showed no net benefit for all-cause mortality .\nFurthermore , CDC data , as well as data provided by life insurance companies stratified by age , showed a 40 percent rise in all-cause mortality among working-age adults ( 18- to 64-year-olds ) in 2021 during the mass vaccination campaign , as compared to the previous five-year baseline .\nTo put this into context , actuaries tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-cause mortality is a once in 200-year disastrous event .\nThe United States didn \u2019 t see this kind of spike even during World War II .\nWhen age groups were further stratified , life insurance mortality in quarter three of 2021 during the mass vaccination campaign showed even more alarming excess-mortality statistics among middle-aged adults : Most of these excess deaths were not due to COVID .\nNor can missed screenings and missed medical appointments during lockdowns account for most of these deaths .\nIf you skip a colonoscopy , you don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colon cancer .\nYou get a slight elevation in your risk of dying from cancer sometime in the next 10 to 20 years .\nLikewise if you have diabetes and miss your routine primary care appointment for a year , you might consequently have poorly controlled blood sugar for several months .\nThis leads not to death a year later , but to a mildly elevated risk of diabetic complications much further down the road .\nSomething else\u2014something sudden and acute\u2014happened in 2021 that massively affected mortality for young and middle-aged adults .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in examining this disaster .\nThis total disinterest is a barometer of their priorities .\nHowever , along with other concerned doctors and scientists , I \u2019 ve begun working with insurance industry executives and regulators who are keen on getting answers regarding vaccine safety and other potential causes of this dramatically increased mortality .\nBut regardless of whether it turns out that vaccines caused net harm , it \u2019 s at least clear that the mRNA vaccines produced no net mortality benefits for the population .\n( It may turn out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit for the elderly offset by overall harm to the young\u2014the jury is still out .\nMy read of the current data suggests that any benefits to some populations will remain short-term and will be offset by longer-term problems . )\nWe were reassured time and again by the health establishment that mRNA vaccines would not alter our DNA .\nThe conventional dogma in genetics for many years was that DNA is transcribed to RNA which is translated into proteins : the arrow moved only in this direction , or so we thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sometimes be reversed by enzymes such as reverse transcriptase , the mechanism found in HIV viruses .\nA recent study found that mRNA from the COVID vaccines was inserted into the DNA of human liver cells in the lab ( in vitro ) .\nThis finding needs to be reproduced in animal models ( in vivo ) , but this study suggests that the reassurances that these vaccines could not change our DNA may have been premature .\nWe are learning as we go with this technology : shooting ( or jabbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite the lackluster performance of the mRNA platform in its first mass rollout , enthusiasts remain undeterred .\nAccording to advocates , this was merely an early experiment for these genetic therapies ( one can not plausibly call them vaccines any longer , even with the CDC changing its definition of vaccine last year to accommodate these products ) .\nOne notable mRNA technology enthusiast , Jamie Metzl , has an impressive pedigree .\nAccording to his bio , Metzl is \u201c a leading technology futurist \u201d and member of the WHO \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editing .\nHe is the author of five books ,

an article in Newsweek on the future of mRNA technologies with the headline , \u201c Miraculous mRNA Vaccines Are Only the Beginning.\n\u201d Metzl claims that these vaccines offer an \u201c early look at how the miraculous tools of the genetics revolution will transform our health care and our world over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers to hack our DNA , he opines , and \u201c the new vaccines are perfect early examples of this \u2018 godlike technology.\n\u2019 \u201d ( Emphasis mine . )\nThese are his words , not mine .\nMetzl explains , \u201c The vaccines , in essence , transform our bodies into personalized manufacturing plants producing an otherwise foreign object to trigger our natural immune response.\n\u201d The possibilities are endless , he waxes : \u201c This approach will soon create a whole new platform for fighting cancers and other diseases , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound than vaccination.\n\u201d While these transformations were well underway before the pandemic , COVID \u201c supercharged the genetics revolution , \u201d which \u201c will soon touch our lives ever more intimately.\n\u201d This revolution will include not just enormous advances in agriculture , industry , and medicine , it will also \u201c recast our evolutionary trajectory as a species.\n\u201d To Metzl \u2019 s credit\u2014and here I agree with him\u2014he advises , \u201c The future of our species

Cardiology found that administration of the anti-viral drug Paxlovid can interact with several commonly prescribed cardiovascular drugs and be associated with an increased risk for blood clots and

antiplatelet agents used to thin the blood during the treatment of coronary artery disease , especially if a patient has a stent , study authors suggest that aspirin and prasugrel are safe to co-administer with Paxlovid .\nHowever , the researchers found there is an increased risk of blood clots when Paxlovid is given with clopidogrel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Paxlovid is given with ticagrelor.7 For statins , which are drugs that lower cholesterol in the blood , co-administration of simvastatin or lovastatin with Paxlovid can lead to increased plasma levels and subsequent muscle

allergic reactions to vaccines , including severe ones like anaphylaxis , which can lead to unconsciousness , seizures , shock , coma and death , occur within 15 to 30 minutes after a shot .\n\u201c

Should Be Assumed to Be Linked to the Shot Consequently , it stands to reason that reactions occurring within 15-30 minutes of a vaccination would immediately be suspected of being linked to the vaccine given and not dismissed as a mere coincidence .\nBut that does not seem to be what happens in many cases because , even when the timing of a reaction is in such close proximity to the administration of a shot , many public health officials and medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine might have caused the harm done .\nA good example of this is the recent case of Carol Diane Pierce , 69 , who died on Sept. 14 , 2022 a mere seven minutes after getting a booster dose of a COVID shot at a Shoppers Drug Mart in Saskatoon ( Saskatchewan ) , Canada .\nPierce , who was reportedly healthy , received the shot and was waiting during the required 15-minute period of observation before leaving the drugstore , when she suddenly collapsed on the floor.5 The Saskatchewan Ministry of @ @ @ @ @ @

this person died from natural causes.\n\u201d In other words\u2014it was just a coincidence.5 6 In the death of Drene Keyes , 58 , on Jan. 30 , 2021 less than an hour after receiving the first dose of

breathing and started vomiting every 20 to 30 seconds .\nShe returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shot of epinephrine in one of her legs and a second shot of epinephrine in an arm .\nKeyes was also given oxygen .\nShe died shortly thereafter at VCU Tappahannock Hospital.7 8 On Feb. 7 , 2021 , a man in his 70s died in Manhattan , New York just 25 minutes after receiving a COVID shot .\nThe deceased , whose name was not released to the public , collapsed suddenly as he was leaving the Jacob Javits Convention Center , where he was vaccinated , and was quickly taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital where he died.9 \u201c Initial indications are that the man did not have any allergic reaction to the vaccine , \u201d according to New York state health commissioner Howard Zucker , MD .\nThe man had reportedly waited the required 15 minutes observation after the vaccination , \u201c where he exhibited no adverse reactions or any distress.\n\u201d Dr. Zucker said.9 On Feb. 12 , 2021 , a 78-year-old woman died in California less than 15 minutes after receiving the first dose of Comirnaty at California State Polytechnic ( Cal Poly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she got the shot , she started complaining of discomfort .\nAccording to Michael Morris , MD , the physician director of Kaiser Permanente \u2019 s Southern California vaccination program , which operated the Cal Poly vaccination site , the woman lost

that this very sad incident is not related to the vaccine , \u201d he said.10 Cases of Death Minutes After Vaccination are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , a person who suffers an anaphylactic reaction and dies within minutes of getting vaccinated is found by a coroner to have died as a result of the shot .\nAn example of this is the case of Jeanie Evans , 68 , who died on Mar .\n24 , 2021 in Topeka , Kansas

who chose to exercise their medical informed consent rights and not get vaccinated for COVID-19 .\nThe hit pieces laid the blame for the continuing COVID pandemic squarely on the shoulders of unvaccinated Americans .\nWhy ?\nBecause in a crisis situation in which there appears to be no end in sight or any quick solution or easy exit strategy , identifying a scapegoat may often be the next best thing.1 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The underlying assumption behind the scapegoating of unvaccinated people by the media was that COVID shots available to the public were capable of preventing infection with and transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and , thus , represented the solution to ending the COVID pandemic once and for all .\nThose opting not to get the shots and remain unvaccinated were then , logically , to blame for the unnecessary continuation of the pandemic .\nOf course , this underlying assumption about how unvaccinated people were the ones getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 and spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground at the time .\nIn January 2021 , The Vaccine Reaction reported that the World Health Organization ( WHO ) had warned that there was no guarantee the COVID shots would prevent people from getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 and transmitting it to others.10 The TVR article , written by Barbara Loe Fisher , also noted a Newsweek interview with Anthony Fauci , MD , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , which reinforced the WHO \u2019 s admission that health officials did not know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission.10 Fisher wrote : Fisher quoted WHO chief scientist and pediatrician Soumya Swaminathan , MD , who said : We continue to wait for more results from the vaccine trials to really understand whether the vaccines , apart from preventing symptomatic disease and severe disease and deaths , whether they \u2019 re also going to reduce infection or prevent people from getting infected with the virus , then from passing it on or transmitting it to other people .\nI don \u2019 t \u2019 believe we have the evidence on any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s going to prevent people from actually getting the infection and therefore being able to pass it on.10 During the summer of 2021 , there was an outbreak of COVID in Provincetown , Massachusetts , in which 74 percent of the people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and diagnosed were fully vaccinated .\nAfter analyzing the data from the outbreak , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) announced that vaccinated individuals can become infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and transmit it to others.11 That was a watershed moment in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that the available COVID shots could not be relied on to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission .\nThat is the moment in history that the rationale for blaming unvaccinated people for ongoing COVID pandemic ceased to make any sense .\nBut still , the media persisted , even after CDC director Rochelle Walensky , MD publicly stated on Aug. 5 , 2021 that while she believed the COVID shots \u201c work well \u201d with the Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus \u201c with regard to severe illness and death , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent transmission \u201d of the virus .\nOn Aug 12 , 2021 , Salon published an article titled \u201c It \u2019 s OK to blame the

and unvaccinated for being irresponsible ?\nReally ?\n\u201d 7 8 12 By the end of 2021 , the hit pieces in the media against Americans unvaccinated for COVID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sink in that the shots were not stopping the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus .\nGiven that the CDC had plainly stated the COVID shots could not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission , the argument in favor of vaccination would no longer be about protecting others but rather about protecting oneself .\nThat made it much more difficult for the media to target unvaccinated people .\nIf people didn \u2019 t want to protect themselves , well then so be it\u2026 that was their problem .\nBy 2022 , the corporate media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans .\nClearly , the attacks had become harder to justify , as more information seeped out about the inability ( or poor or unknown ability ) of the COVID shots to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission.13 14 15 Pfizer Admits Shot Never Tested to Show Ability to Prevent SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Transmission Finally , on Oct. 11 , 2022 , Pfizer \u2019 s president of international developed markets , Janine Small , admitted that the company \u2019 s BNT162b2 mRNA biologic ( now known as \u201c Comirnaty \u201d ) was never tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and transmission before it was made available to the general public.16 17 18 Small was testifying before a committee of the European Parliament when she was asked the following question by MEP Rob Roos of The Netherlands : In a video he posted shortly afterward , Roos said : If you don \u2019 t get

@ @ @ @ @ s what they said .\nToday , this turns out to be complete nonsense .\nIn a COVID in the European Parliament , one of the Pfizer directors admitted to me : at the time of the introduction , the vaccine had never been tested on stopping the transmission of the virus .\nThis removes the entire legal basis for the COVID passport .\nThe COVID passport that led to massive institutional discrimination as people lost access to essential parts of society .\nI find this to be shocking , even criminal.18 After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the idea of attacking people for not getting a COVID shot

mistakes are forgivable\u2014if one has the courage to admit the mistake .\nPaul Fenyves , a primary care physician in New York City who specializes in internal medicine , seems to have learned this lesson .\nFenyves , a primary care doctor at Weill Cornell Medicine , recently admitted he was wrong to support vaccine mandates .\n\u201c I was initially supportive of COVID vaccine mandates in the Fall of 2021 .\nAt the time , I was told that COVID vaccines don \u2019 t only protect the individual receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community by reducing spread of the virus , \u201d Fenyves wrote on the Substack Sensible Medicine .\nConvinced that mandatory vaccination would create a \u201c wall of immunity \u201d that would bring the pandemic to an end more quickly , Fenyves said it seemed \u201c reasonable to prioritize societal welfare over individual autonomy , \u201d noting that early clinical trials of Pfizer \u2019 s vaccine were shown to stop 95 percent of infections .\n\u201c Surely a vaccine that prevents almost all infections would halt community spread , right ?\nWrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a time when COVID vaccines could significantly reduce community transmission , but that time was short-lived , and the virus quickly evolved and learned to evade vaccine-induced immunity.\n\u201d For Fenyves , his awakening moment came in December 2021 , when Portugal experienced a massive surge of COVID despite a vaccination rate of more than 90 percent .\nFenyves concedes there are other reasons one could support mandatory vaccination even if it doesn \u2019 t reduce community spread , noting that some contend forced vaccination is moral because it \u2019 s done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find these arguments to be weak justifications for violating an individual \u2019 s autonomy and mandating a medical intervention , \u201d he writes .\n\u201c Furthermore , these arguments are completely inadequate when applied to young people , whose risk of hospitalization from COVID is low , and whose likelihood of benefiting from vaccination is similarly low.\n\u201d Some may argue that Fenyves is right about vaccine mandates , but for the wrong reasons .\nVinay Prasad , an associate professor in University of California , San Francisco \u2019 s Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be wrong even if there was a community benefit because the social costs are too high .\n\u201c My conclusion was always that the societal harm of mandates far exceeds any benefit , and as such I always opposed mandates , \u201d writes Prasad in an introduction to Fenyves \u2019 s article .\nAs early as August 2021 it was clear that \u201c vaccine breakthroughs \u201d were quite common and that naturally immunity conferred powerful protection against COVID .\nWhy was it not until December 2021 that Fenyves realized he was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points , but they should not overshadow the larger lesson Fenyves is sharing , which is that scientists and public health officials must act more humbly with their immense power and recognize the limits of their knowledge .\n\u201c Those in the medical community who , like me , argued that vaccines should be mandated to protect the community should feel chastened , \u201d writes Fenyves .\n\u201c When considering mandating vaccines in the future , we should proceed with humility , acknowledging that our knowledge is far from perfect and our truths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last sentence are incredibly important : knowledge and humility .\nThese same two words are found in F.A .\nHayek \u2019 s famous 1974 Nobel Prize speech , in which he warned against scientists and planners acting on \u201c a pretense of knowledge.\n\u201d Instead of recognizing the limitations of knowledge in an infinitely complex world , Hayek saw modern humans \u201c dizzy with success \u201d over the marvels of modern science , which had convinced them they possessed enough knowledge to engineer society effectively .\n\u201c The curious task of economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fatal Conceit , \u201c is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.\n\u201d The antidote to this fatal conceit\u2014which Hayek warned leads to \u201c grave consequences \u201d \u2014is humility .\nT.S .\nEliot once observed that humility \u201c is the most difficult of all virtues to achieve , \u201d and a lack of it is what lurked beneath the deadly collectivist schemes of the twentieth century , from Stalin \u2019 s Five Year Plans to Mao \u2019 s Great Leap Forward and beyond .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d is born of arrogance , Hayek understood .\nAnd it was this arrogance that led public health officials and politicians to decide they had enough knowledge to make life-and-death decisions for others during the pandemic , to decide what they had to put into their bodies .\nFenyves is right that a healthy dose if humility is in order , and that the knowledge we possess is far from perfect .\nIf we fail to learn this lesson

, PhD , associate head of the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Portsmouth and leader of the study.1 The loss in confidence in vaccines is believed to have been influenced by public

hesitancy and refusal to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on social media.8 Surprisingly , studies ( like the one in Nature ) , which blame the growth in vaccine hesitancy in the United States and countries around the world on misinformation published on social media , demonstrate little or no interest in considering that people may have legitimate concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the COVID shots and that this unease might logically carry over to vaccines in general .\nIt \u2019 s as if those researchers , who are attributing vaccine hesitancy merely to information they classify as \u201c misinformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bothered to keep up with the countless reports of severe adverse reactions and deaths directly linked to COVID shots , especially injuries and deaths that occur shortly

But the bad-info-on-social media theory for explaining the growing phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy is so easy and so seductive in its simplicity that it is hard to let go of , particularly if

they have also risked dire side effects , while those responsible all of a sudden deny that this absolute argument never really was crucial .\nThis was just a confirmation of what we already knew .\nStill , when Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Pfizer \u2019 s representative Janine Small , it was nonetheless a historic moment .\nHad the vaccine been tested before it was launched to see whether it protected against the spread of COVID-19 ?\nThe answer was \u201d No , \u201d followed by an awkward laugh and a word salad : \u201d We had to really move with the speed of science to understand what is taking place in the market\u2026 \u201d Let that sink in .\nPfizer has known all along that these injections have no greater proven effect on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOnce again , this is nothing new .\nPeter Doshi , one of the editors of the British Medical Journal informed us already two years ago that the vaccine manufacturers \u2019 clinical trials were not designed to answer the most relevant questions .\nHowever , the announcement in the European Parliament still set off a powerful tidal wave , which should sweep along some of those who have spread and fueled this lie .\nI am talking about heads of state and top bureaucrats , epidemiologists and experts , editors-in-chief and celebrities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Johan Carlsson , the director general of the Swedish public health agency ( Folkh\u00e4lsomyndigheten ) in office at the time , declared in a well-attended press conference in June 2021 that they now recommend young people aged sixteen and above to take the Pfizer vaccine , he cited three main reasons for this : Was Carlsson himself misled by the vaccine manufacturers ?\nOr did he deliberately mislead the press corps present and the Swedish people ?\nWhen a public narrative starts to fall apart , it can have unforeseen consequences .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie is exposed and people are forced to realize they have been profoundly fooled , a follow-up question may well present itself : If they can lie about something this significant , what else have they been lying about ?\nTo prevent a domino effect to that consequence , they now try to minimize the damage , such as what Reuters \u2019 \u201d fact-checker \u201d did with the following tweet : The truth is , they have , albeit nicely wrapped up at times .\nIn January 2021 , shortly after the launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccines \u201c have been emergency approved to prevent individuals from the age of 16 from getting COVID-19.\n\u201d In May of this year , Pfizer \u2019 s CEO Albert Bourla participated in a live discussion at the World Economic Forum .\nWhen asked why anyone should get vaccinated if there is now a treatment for COVID-19 , Bourla replied : \u201d The primary thing is not to get the disease to begin with , and therefore you should get vaccinated .\nIn this way , you also protect those you love.\n\u201d CJ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d should be called \u201d gaslighters , \u201d since what they really do is engage in psychological manipulation .\nGaslighting means that you systematically feed your victim false information and make them question what they know to be true .\nEventually , they end up doubting their own perception , their memories and even their sanity .\nIn other words , a form of crazy making .\nThe \u201d masses \u201d Hopkins writes , \u201c having forced themselves to believe whatever you needed them to believe during the Shock-and-Awe phase , have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever you needed them to believe then , and believe whatever you need them to believe now.\n\u201d The type of historical revisionism that Reuters \u2019 \u201d fact-checker \u201d engages in ; we have seen a great deal of that since the E.U .\nParliament debacle .\nSuddenly parts of the mainstream media pretend as if they never heard about any promises about protection against the spread of infection .\nI phoned Swedish radio and get connected to the news desk for the daily news show Ekot .\nI ask how long they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the questioning of the Pfizer representative .\nThe woman I was passed on to dismissesed my question by saying that no authorities have claimed that the vaccine would protect against the spread of infection , but that they only have maintained that it protects against serious illness and death .\nI objected by saying that the mantra of the Swedish public health agency , Folkh\u00e4lsomyndigheten : \u201d It protects against serious illness and death , \u201d is something that they switched to at the end of 2021 .\nBefore that , the mantra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spread of infection .\nThis is easy to check via older versions of the Swedish public health agency \u2019 s own website , for example from the autumn of 2021 , when they wrote : But the woman at the news desk insists that the agency never claims that the vaccine would protect against the spread of infection .\nThe conversation feels surreal .\nI remind her of the well-attended press conference where the then director general of the public health agency claims exactly that , but she hangs up on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the pandemic , so I know what I am talking about !\nI am not convinced that the womanat the news desk was lying deliberately .\nIt may also be a question of serious denial that comes into play when reality gets too much to bear .\nMark Twain said that it \u2019 s easier to fool people than it is to convince them that they have been fooled .\nThe author Upton Sinclair added that it is impossible to make a man understand something if his livelihood depends on not understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blinders , the announcement from Pfizer should prompt a sobering period .\nI wonder what they are saying today , all those principals and teachers who pressured their students to take the shots .\nWhat will the reactions be from employers who have laid off unvaccinated or denied them employment ?\nWhat do all artists and celebrities who urged us in costly campaigns to \u201c roll up our sleeves \u201d and \u201d take one for the team , \u201d so that we could hug again , say now ?\nWhat will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from right to left , who all competed to condemn the unvaccinated ?\nWhat does Peter Kadhammar say today ?\nIn a chronicle in Aftonbladet last autumn he spoke in favour of the unvaccinated paying for their own healthcare , since \u201c they sabotage society \u2019 s attempts to combat a lethal pandemic.\n\u201d All you well-paid bullies ; what are your comments to the vaccine not having been tested for its ability to stop the spread of infection ?\nAnd what about the friendships that were ruined and the relations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that vaccine passports and malicious media reporting brought along ?\nIn her report \u201d Livet i vaccinpassens skugga \u201d ( Eng : \u201d Life in the shadow of the vaccine passport , \u201d my translation ) , Diana Blom interviews some of those who were harassed and socially excluded in their workplaces .\nWe also get to meet students who lost their internships , and a faithful church goer who was refused to attend Christmas Day service .\nApart from nonsensical tragedies , we have also witnessed absurd farces , such as when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Djokovic was banned from defending his title at the Australian Open on the grounds that he was a risk of infection .\nEven if many things seem comical , they stop being amusing when you think of all those hundreds of millions of people worldwide who have taken their jabs because they were obliged to do so .\nHow many have suffered side effects ?\nHow many have died or are dealing with chronic consequences ?\nOnly in Sweden , 104.000 individuals have reported suspected side effects , while it is well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all side effects are being reported .\nIn my interviews with the physician Sven Rom\u00e1n , he informs me that myocarditis and pericarditis is a very common side effect with men aged 13 to 18 after receiving their second dose of the mRNA vaccines , that an increased number of menstrual disorders have been observed , that fertility may be affected as the number of births per fertile woman in Sweden has decreased drastically since the vaccination began , and that many pathologists all over the world report an increased incidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As an increasing number of irregularities are becoming known , I believe we will become used to seeing more historical revisionism of the kind we are already familiar with from other sensitive fields .\nIn 2017 , the Swedish public service television , SVT , broadcast the exclusive and praised American documentary The Vietnam War , by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick .\nThe title itself is deceptive , both from a moral and a geographical point of view .\nThe Vietnam War should , according to activist Noam Chomsky , be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture the monstrous destruction that was the result of history \u2019 s most powerful military-industrial empire which , for over a decade , used its full force against a poor peasant society as well as the neighbouring countries of Laos and Cambodia .\nWhile the documentary does present strong eyewitness accounts and for that reason alone is worth seeing , it describes this crime against humanity throughout using euphemisms such as \u201c tragic mistake , \u201d \u201c best of intentions , \u201d and \u201c good faith.\n\u201d Washington had the best of intentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made .\nShit happens .\nThis is how I believe the historical revisionists will portray the criminality\u2014the deliberate lies and the baseless discrimination\u2014that has caused millions of people , who would otherwise never have taken these injections , to now suffer serious health problems .\nPortraying the crimes of states and authorities as accidents at work is welcome because it resonates with how most people would wish the world to be .\nWe do not want to believe that authoritative bodies purposefully commit psychopathic deeds .\nThe thought that our decision-makers would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injections did not protect against the spread of infection is horrible .\nThe tendency for wishful thinking that sometimes turns into denial resembles the dynamics in families with abuse problems .\nThe child who speaks out often faces anger and accusations of lying .\nThe other children want to keep the image of their father as the family \u2019 s provider of safety and security .\nPsychopaths can also nurture the image of being engaged and responsible individuals .\nPfizer \u2019 s VD Albert Bourla reminds me of The Mask of Sanity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychopathy as a phenomenon ( published in 1941 ) .\nAs the title indicates , psychopaths learn to behave as if they were normal \u2013 otherwise they would not be able to have successful careers .\nBut since everything is theatre , they sometimes reveal themselves and the mask drops .\nThis is what happened during the above-mentioned discussion at the World Economic Forum in which Pfizer \u2019 s CEO participated .\nBourla gripes about \u201c A very fanatical group of anti-vaxxers \u201d wishing to take Pfizer to court .\nHe then starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the sun didn \u2019 t go up because people were vaccinated.\n\u201d I wonder what Cindy Darell , the handball player from G\u00f6teborg that I recently interviewed , would say about Bourla \u2019 s joking ways , so bereft of empathy ?\nShe was healthy as a horse before taking the shots .\nBut since taking them , she has not been able to play for an entire year .\nShe has suffered breathing difficulties , pressure in the chest and a tingling sensation on her left side .\nHer friend who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped at two ) suffered cardiac arrest .\nI know a woman whose 18-year-old son took the shots to be able to study abroad .\nHe died in his sleep shortly after .\nThe mother is still in shock , but is thinking of suing Pfizer , if possible .\nWhat does she think about being dismissed as a superstitious fool ?\nAfter Pfizer \u2019 s announcement in the E.U .\nParliament last month , I contacted a friend on Facebook who expressed their full support for the vaccine passes , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was convinced that he would have second thoughts now that he found out the entire foundation for the vaccine passes\u2014that they were meant to protect the vaccinated from the unvaccinated\u2014was based on a lie .\nBut he thought the topic was no longer an issue .\nAnother vaccine passport advocate I contacted didn \u2019 t believe the message from Pfizer was any cause for concern .\nAgain , I think of the American documentary on Vietnam .\nThe last part is about the end of the war .\nPresident Jimmy Carter didn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensation nor apologies since \u201c the destruction was mutual.\n\u201d One could , of course , argue that the United States had lost 58,000 soldiers while they had killed around 5 million people , that the Vietnamese troops had never invaded the U.S. , nor sprayed millions of tons of Agent Orange on the fields of California and Ohio , or drowned naked Americans in napalm , etc .\nThe closing message of the documentary is nevertheless that the \u201d war \u201d had been devastating for both sides , and that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on .\nThe Beatles \u2019 hit Let It Be is played during the credits .\nImagine if the Holocaust had been depicted similarly .\nNo Nuremberg trial , no Aftermath Agencies , no awareness campaigns , no guided tours to Auschwitz , no Remembrance Day on January 27th .\nJust a quiet word of advice to leave the tragedy behind and move on .\nLet It Be .\nLet It Be .\nSomeone else who would like us to turn the page and move on is former Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson .\n@ @ @ @

Naftali Bennett compared the unvaccinated to terrorists walking the streets with machine guns shooting ( i.e .\ninfecting ) the innocent .\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the

identify and collect data on every individual living in every country through use of a \u201c digital health certificate \u201d that monitors vaccination status for the purpose of granting or preventing the individual from entering public spaces.9 Digital ID & Vaccine Tracking Plan Began in U.S. in Early 1990s The 21st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all children in the world began to take shape in the early 1990s .\nAfter the 1990 World Summit for Children was held in New York City , in 1991 the Children \u2019 s Vaccine Initiative ( CVI ) was launched by the Rockefeller Foundation , WHO , United Nations Development Program [ UNDP ] , United Nations Children \u2019 s Fund [ UNICEF ] and the World Bank to \u201c accelerate and apply advances in the science , development , manufacture and

by former President Jimmy Carter , to create city and state based electronic vaccination registries and tracking systems.13 14 Within 24 days of President Bill Clinton taking office , on Feb. 12 , 1993 Secretary of Health Donna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Immunization Initiative \u201d to ensure that every child would receive every federally recommended vaccine .\nThe legislation included creating \u201c immunization information systems \u201d at the local and state level that are hooked up to a national vaccine tracking system operated by public health officials.15 Each child would be assigned a Unique Health Care Identifier Number linked to not only vaccination status information but other identifying personal medical information , as well.16 On Aug. 10 , 1993 , Congress passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act that created the Vaccines for Children ( VFC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund a network of state-based electronic vaccine tracking registries that can monitor the vaccination histories of children without the informed consent of their parents .\nThen Congress established a national Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) system under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPPA ) that was signed into law by President Clinton in 1996,18 and the stage had been set for a government-operated electronic surveillance system to monitor the personal medical records and vaccination status of all individuals , not just children.19 20 The justification for this big data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated the privacy of Americans , was for public health officials to \u201c identify new cases of disease and to make decisions about when to apply public health interventions.\n\u201d 21 Today , the nationwide federally funded Electronic Health Records system in the U.S. captures the

has gotten a COVID shot , where and when.24 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has consistently opposed the creation of a Unique Health Care Identifier Number and electronic health and vaccine record tracking systems that require automatic enrollment .\nMost of them do not contain informed consent protections for those who object to being tagged and tracked by government health officials and potentially subjected

: The people of America have never been asked if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements from state to state and be privy to the details of their health care choices without their informed consent\u2026 What

every vaccine the drug companies produce and public health officials decide to mandate.26 United Nation \u2019 s WHO Is Headquarters for the Global Public Health Empire Powered by Public-Private Partnerships The Children \u2019 s Vaccine Initiative launched by the United Nations , Rockefeller Foundation and World Bank 30 years ago merged the power of governments with the wealth of industries to give birth to the most profitable and politically powerful business partnership in the history of the world.27 That public-private business partnership has grown over the past three decades to create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Organization that , as I pointed out in my most recent commentary , Weaponizing COVID to Promote Collectivism , must devalue autonomy and other human rights in order to force everyone to buy and use vaccines .\nEarlier this year , the WHO contracted with a German technology company to build QR code-based software for global electronic verification of vaccine passports,28 and there are reports that U.S. companies are ready to be involved as well.29 The global mandatory vaccination plan will not succeed without the cooperation of all governments , especially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eliminating all dissent and punishing the dissenters.30 31 The COVID pandemic response by the Public Health Empire has advanced the goal of instituting a global

ID that is the gateway to requiring everyone to carry a \u201c vaccine passport.\n\u201d 32 According to Nick Corbishley , author of Scanned : Why Vaccine Passports and Digital Identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Personal Freedom , sponsors of the B20 Meeting included representatives of large corporate industries , banking and other financial institutions , such as the World Bank Group , World Economic Forum , Global Business Coalition , U.S. Chamber of Commerce , BusinessEurope , The Confederation of Indian Industry , International Federation of Accountants , Deloitte , Accenture , Institute of Internal Auditors , and International Organization of Employers .\nAs Cobishley noted , the digital certificate is \u201c nothing more and nothing less than a digital ID.\n\u201d He said : Their mass @ @ @ @ @

Dying of COVID Were Vaccinated", "content": "A recent analysis done by Cynthia Cox of the Kaiser Family Foundation for The Health 202 newsletter of The Washington Post found that approximately 58 percent of the people who died of COVID-19 in the United States in August 2022 had been vaccinated or vaccinated and boosted for COVID .\nEarlier this year , it was estimated that 42 percent of deaths attributed to COVID were among vaccinated or vaccinated and boosted individuals.1 2 3 4 This \u201c troubling trend \u201d is something that has been developing during the past year , according to an article published in the Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As vaccination rates have increased and new variants appeared , the share of deaths of people who were vaccinated has been steadily rising , \u201d wrote Post health researcher McKenzie Beard.2 Cox \u2019 s analysis , which used data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2019 s ( CDC ) COVID Data Tracker , follows the release of data by the California Health and Human Services Agency ( CalHHS ) revealing that 41 percent of the COVID deaths that occurred in San Diego County during May-July 2022 were among fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 104,288 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in San Diego County from May to July .\nOf that total , more than 68,000 San Diegans who received COVID shots became infected with SARS-CoV-2 ( about 65 percent ) , 2,417 of them were hospitalized for COVID symptoms and 88 of them ended up dying of COVID.5 6 Of the San Diegans hospitalized , approximately 1,600 of them ( about 66 percent ) were fully vaccinated or fully vaccinated and boosted .\nOf those who died , between 41 and 67 percent of them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boosted.6 If You \u2019 re Vaccinated , You \u2019 re Not Going to Die of COVID .\nThat \u2019 s a Myth .\nThe phenomenon of people who have been partially or fully vaccinated ( including many who also received one or more booster shots ) dying from COVID has likely perplexed many Americans , given assurances from leaders within the U.S. government over the past two years that if you get the COVID shots , not only will you not be hospitalized for COVID , neither will you die from the disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such assurances , but perhaps the most high-profile and blatant one was uttered by President Biden at a televised town hall forum in Cincinnati , Ohio on July 21 , 2021 .\nPresident Biden said : This public guarantee by President Biden came only a few days after the director of the CDC , Rochelle Walensky , MD , stated at a White House press briefing that more than 97 percent of Americans being hospitalized for COVID symptoms were unvaccinated .\nThe figure apparently served to justify Dr. Walensky \u2019 s highly publicized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic of the unvaccinated , \u201d which was subsequently repeated countless times by governors , legislators , journalists , news commentators , public health officials and health care providers throughout the country .\nPerhaps most of all by the President of the United States.8 9 10 The phrase \u201c pandemic of the unvaccinated \u201d was carefully being seared into the American psyche and became an invaluable marketing tool for encouraging people to rush and get the initial COVID shots and then , eventually , the requisite booster shots .\nThe analysis by Cox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the data from San Diego County\u2014the second largest county in California , with a population of nearly 3.3 million\u2014should effectively put to rest the notion that those vaccinated for COVID can avoid being hospitalized for the disease or dying from it.6 \u201c We can no longer say this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated , \u201d Cox said.1 2 3 4 The \u201c Pandemic of the Unvaccinated \u201d Was Another Myth Of course , the problem with this declaration by Cox is that it was never a \u201c pandemic of the unvaccinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people who dutifully went out and got vaccinated for COVID would be protected from getting infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus or at least being hospitalized for COVID or certainly from dying of COVID was never based on scientific fact .\nThe 97 percent COVID hospitalization figure cited by Dr. Walensky at a White House press briefing on July 16 , 2021 and again at another White House press briefing on Aug. 5 , 2021 was , at the very least , deceptive and most likely woefully inaccurate .\nThe figure implied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than three percent of those hospitalized for COVID in the U.S .\nThis led many people to think that the COVID shots were responsible for the extremely low hospitalization rate , leading to the inevitable conclusion that the shots were working nearly to perfection.8 9 10 That conclusion might have been valid had there been a relatively equal number of unvaccinated people versus vaccinated people in the U.S. during the January-June 2021 timeframe from which Dr. Walensky \u2019 s data was derived in order to make a fair and balanced comparison .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and countless others ( including President Biden ) who took their cue from her were able to make the \u201c pandemic of the unvaccinated \u201d case was not because unvaccinated people were necessarily more susceptible to becoming ill with COVID , but because through at least April 2021 , there were still relatively few people in the U.S. who were vaccinated.8 As of Jan. 1 , 2021 , only 0.5 percent of the U.S. population had been fully vaccinated .\nBy Feb. 1 , the figure had risen to 1.8 percent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 7.6 percent .\nBy Apr .\n1 , it was 16.8 percent .\nBy May 1 , it was 30.9 percent .\nOn June 1 , 40.6 percent of the U.S. population had been fully vaccinated .\nBy the end of June 2021 , it was 46.3 percent.8 By Aug. 31 , 2022 , 79 percent of the U.S. population had gotten at least one COVID shot ; 68 percent were considered \u201c fully vaccinated ; \u201d and 33 percent had gotten a booster dose.11 For the record then , it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unvaccinated.\n\u201d From the outset of the pandemic , vaccinated ( and boosted ) people have been among those contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus , being hospitalized for COVID symptoms and dying from COVID .\nThe size of this segment has likely been larger than the CDC has led the public to believe , but it \u2019 s hard to know just how much larger because the agency has admitted that its access to COVID-related data from state and local governments has been limited.12 Public health data in the U.S. is not collected uniformly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments in this country , all of which operate independently , \u201d notes David Fleming , MD of the University of Washington School of Public Health in Seattle.13 Dr. Walensky herself has acknowledged that her agency can request health data from states and local governments , \u201c but we can \u2019 t compel or mandate data from those jurisdictions .\nThat is shocking to many people.\n\u201d This comment is consistent with the following statement on the CDC website : \u201c CDC does not have direct authority to require data reporting.\n\u201d 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how inconsistent data coming from such a system would be , and that is the system the CDC has relied upon for the COVID information it has been providing the U.S. public over the past three years .\nBecause Cox \u2019 s analysis is based on data from the CDC \u2019 s COVID Data Tracker , it is probably no more than an educated guesstimate of the percentage of Americans dying from COVID who have been vaccinated or vaccinated and boosted for the disease .\nThe analysis , however , does seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realistic , perspective .\nCertainly a sobering one to those who have placed so much confidence in these experimental pharmaceutical products .\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week , click here .", "author": "Marco Caceres", "url":

"thevaccinereaction", "title": "The Problem With Declaring a \u2018Pandemic Amnesty\u2019", "content": "Opinion | Last month , The Atlantic published an article by Dr. Emily Oster , an economics professor at Brown University , titled \u201c Let \u2019 s Declare A Pandemic Amnesty.\n\u201d In the piece , Oster argues that , throughout the Covid-19 pandemic , we were plagued by a lack of true knowledge about the best way to react to the virus .\nConsequently , \u201c almost every position was taken on every topic .\nAnd on every topic , someone was eventually proved right , and someone else was proved wrong.\n\u201d Because of this , Oster argues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and move on ; after all , how could they be blamed for their position when all the information was not available ?\nBy doing this , she concludes , we can avoid \u201c a repetitive doom loop \u201d of negativity and address the issues\u2014ranging from a dip in test scores to a rise in mental health problems\u2014that we are now facing .\nThis may seem like a reasonable argument at first glance .\nIt is true that there was a lot we did not know at the start of the pandemic ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the past can prevent people from moving forward in a productive way .\nAt the same time , upon closer examination , the core of Oster \u2019 s argument is deeply flawed because 1 ) it does not reckon with the real injustices done to millions of people during the pandemic as a result of arrogant policymaking and 2 ) it fundamentally misunderstands the nature and role of forgiveness in society .\nThe first issue with Oster \u2019 s argument is that it does not properly consider the injustices done to millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence of policy that was profoundly lacking in humility .\nWe can split up Covid-19 policymaking into two time periods : one is before we had adequate information to make reliable policy decisions and the second is after we had adequate information .\nI understand these categories are somewhat vague , but they will suffice for our purposes because , as we will see , the issue with the policy-making during both of these periods was the same .\nIn the first time period , when we did not have adequate information to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless acted as if they did know .\nThey fell into a trap that the Nobel Prize-winning economist F.A .\nHayek called the pretense of knowledge : namely , \u201c the idea that anyone could know enough to engineer society successfully.\n\u201d In states across the country\u2014in the absence of real evidence but the presence of real conceit\u2014people were prohibited from visiting their sick family members in the hospital and elderly family members in nursing homes , leaving the most vulnerable in our society alone and their loved ones separated from them\u2014even during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were strict limits on the number of people allowed at funerals\u2014depriving the grieving of the best healing power of all : human-to-human connection and support .\nPublic officials even closed beaches , poured sand into outdoor skateparks , and put chains on outdoor basketball hoops\u2014forcing kids into prolonged isolation in their homes .\nAnd for what ?\nHow many lives were saved due to such measures ?\nWe now know , based on numerous studies , that the answer is few to none .\nThere was absolutely nothing dangerous about gathering outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of basketball with friends , for example .\nYet , policymakers\u2014in a time of admitted uncertainty\u2014acted as if they were certain anyway .\nAnd to make matters worse , those who challenged these policies were shut out of the public debate\u2014accused of wanting people to die , of being science deniers , and of spreading \u201c misinformation.\n\u201d Then , in the second time period , when we did have adequate knowledge to make well-informed policy choices , policymakers did not follow the evidence , instead opting to follow ideology and cave to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear example of this .\nOne of the first things that was known about the virus was that kids were the least vulnerable to severe infection .\nWe also soon found out that schools were not a hotspot of Covid transmission .\nEven so , there were prolonged school closures across the country , affecting millions of kids .\nDuring the 2020-2021 school year , fewer than a dozen states had at least 75 percent of kids learning in person ; in 19 states\u2014including some of the largest in the country\u2014the proportion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when kids went back to school , many districts instituted farcical rules such as requiring children to stay home for two weeks any time they had a potential exposure to Covid-19 , requiring masking in classrooms , not allowing kids to talk during lunch , and even forcing them to eat lunch outside in freezing weather .\nConsequently , kids have now fallen behind months in reading and math\u2014with some people reporting that there are third graders unable to even read three-letter words .\nMental health problems have gotten much worse , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third grade that do not remember ever having a normal school year .\nAnd the detrimental effects we are seeing right now are just the tip of the iceberg .\nAnd so the same question applies here : what was this all for ?\nThese policies did little to nothing to protect children , as they were never in significant danger from Covid-19 .\nThey certainly did not make the lives of parents easier , as they had to care for their kids learning online even though they had jobs of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers safer , as studies have shown that schools were not a place of high transmission .\nThis all happened because arrogant policymakers ignored the evidence or presumed to have knowledge they did not actually possess in order to appease either political entities such as teachers \u2019 unions or their own political ideology that held that Covid restrictions must be in accordance with the most stringent risk preferences .\nAnd it \u2019 s not as if public authorities have now learned their lesson .\nEven today , there are schools across the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless they received the Covid-19 vaccine , even though the CDC now admits vaccines do not prevent infection or the spread of the virus .\nFinally , Oster \u2019 s article seems to conflate mistakes made in the absence of evidence by private individuals and mistakes made due to arrogance by public authorities .\nBut those two things are not at all the same .\nThe anger that most people feel is towards the latter , yet , from the beginning of the piece , Oster fails to make this distinction .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why people feel like we can not move on : namely , because policymakers assumed that they knew best , forced their vision onto the entire country , and then never took responsibility when their policies harmed countless people .\nThe second significant issue with Oster \u2019 s argument is that it fundamentally misunderstands the role and nature of forgiveness in society .\nWhile it is of course an important virtue , it is also not the only virtue .\nIn a commentary on the story of Noah , the late Rabbi Jonathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral principle set out in the Torah \u201d is that of justice .\nGod says , \u201c Whoever sheds the blood of man , by man shall his blood be shed ; for in the image of God has God made man.\n\u201d However , Rabbi Sacks points out that this principle , on its own , would \u201c [ draw people ] into a potentially endless and destructive cycle of retaliation , which is bad for both sides.\n\u201d Oster intuitively understands this limitation of justice as a stand-alone value .\nShe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in the context of Covid-19 would lead to \u201c a repetitive doom loop \u201d of negativity\u2014never allowing our society to move forward .\nRabbi Sacks agrees .\nSo , in order to account for the limits of justice acting as the only value , he explains that the second moral principle laid out in the Hebrew Bible is that of forgiveness .\nGod said to Noah , after the flood , that \u201c I will never again curse the ground for man \u2019 s sake , although the imagination of man \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nor will I again destroy every living thing as I have done.\n\u201d From this , we can derive that the world is built on the dual moral imperatives of justice and forgiveness .\nRabbi Sacks writes that \u201c Without these , no group can survive in the long run.\n\u201d He is correct .\nWithout forgiveness , we would be stuck in a cycle of bitter attacks against one another .\nBut , without accountability or justice , the injustices that took place are 1 ) bound to happen again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or forgotten by the victims .\nThe issue with Oster \u2019 s argument is that it assumes forgiveness can and should happen even in the absence of justice .\nBut when an individual is wronged in a serious way , we know from human experience that it is incredibly hard , if not impossible , to move forward productively with the perpetrator until they take responsibility , apologize , and pledge not to wrong that person again .\nThus , it is hard to believe that we can achieve forgiveness in the absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further , generally agreed-upon moral principles would suggest that those who have committed injustices do not deserve to be forgiven\u2014let off the hook , if you will\u2014unless they take responsibility and steps to ensure it does not happen again .\nAnd thus , we realize that even if we could achieve forgiveness in the absence of justice , it is not apparent that we should .\nThis is all to suggest that it seems as though justice and accountability are actually prerequisites to forgiveness .\nIn the case of Covid-19 , we know\u2014as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed on a mass scale .\nWe can therefore conclude that the first thing that needs to happen toward the end of forgiveness is a substantive reckoning among those who committed those injustices , where they take responsibility for their actions , recognize where they went wrong , and take concrete steps to change the institutions , processes , and policy frameworks that produced such mistakes .\nThis includes people ranging from politicians to public health bureaucrats to union leaders .\nTo do so would be to demonstrate a tremendous amount of humility\u2014a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emulated by others .\nPublic trust can only be restored once this takes place because , right now , there is nothing stopping any of the terrible things that happened from happening again .\nIn other words , nothing has changed yet .\nAs always , the proper approach contains a balancing act .\nThe issue is that , currently , too many people have taken extreme positions that neglect one of the two moral principles discussed above : justice and forgiveness .\nHowever , the greater the number of people that recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but rather perfect companions , the closer we will get to being able to move forward as a unified country in order to address the myriad problems we still face .\nThis

Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Authorization ( EUA ) for treatment of COVID disease .\nAntibodies are proteins in the blood that help fight infection and the lab grown proteins ( monoclonal antibodies )

in early 2021 , the public health establishment succumbed to two dangerous temptations : Propaganda and coercion .\nThat their approach deployed these with the common good in mind ( achieving herd immunity ) and with good intentions ( ending the pandemic as quickly as possible ) does not alter the fact that such approaches were deeply misguided and represented deeply disturbing trends in public policy .\nPublic pronouncements in the name of science could not be questioned , and behavioral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary .\nCoercive covid vaccination mandates rested on several unproven postulates , which mainstream opinion took to be axiomatic and unassailable : ( 1 ) the vaccines were safe for everyone ; ( 2 ) the vaccines were necessary for everyone ; therefore , ( 3 ) any vaccine hesitancy is a public relations problem that must be overcome .\nThe \u201c needle in every arm \u201d goal was set in advance ; the only deliberation permitted was about the most efficient means toward this predetermined end .\nAny scientist , physician , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or more of these axioms was at best a nuisance or at worst dangerous\u2014someone to be ignored as backward or dismissed as a threat to public health .\nPeople who asked inconvenient questions were labeled with the dismissive \u201c anti-vax \u201d epithet , a term that functioned to exclude them from the realm of reasonable discourse .\nSome of the vaccine propaganda would have been laughable if it wasn \u2019 t so clearly displaying sanctimonious contempt for its audience .\nConsider a televised public service announcement from Ohio \u2019 s Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misinformation about what \u2019 s in a covid vaccine by explaining , \u201c There are just a few simple ingredients : water , sugar , salt

\u2019 s public health officials think of the intelligence of the average citizen .\nAside from what was said , the most egregious form of propaganda was the vaccine-related information that was deliberately withheld or deemphasized .\nAs mentioned earlier , The New York Times reported in February 2022 : \u201c Two full years into the pandemic , the agency leading the country \u2019 s response to the public health emergency [ the CDC ] has published only a tiny fraction of the data it has collected.\n\u201d For example , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the effectiveness of boosters in

reason for withholding much of its data was that it did not want to increase vaccine hesitancy .\nThe result was messaging from public health officials that sounded indistinguishable from the marketing departments of Pfizer , Moderna , and Johnson & Johnson .\nGranted , public health communications must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a key difference between simplifying information for the layperson and dumbing it down to manipulate the masses , or deliberately suppressing information that might undermine a predetermined public policy .\nThis was not public education but a manipulative effort at behavioral control .\nIn the most precise meaning of the term , it was propaganda .\nLarge swaths of the public who were not hypnotized by the repetition of memes could sense , even if they could not explain , that they were subjected to manipulation .\nAs vaccination rates approached 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uptake slowed by April 2021 .\nReports began to emerge of serious side effects , and studies from Israel , which started its mass vaccination campaign before the US , suggested that vaccine efficacy waned rapidly .\nPublic health efforts pivoted from propaganda to heavy-handed nudges and bribes .\nSeveral states entered vaccinated citizens into lotteries awarding cash prizes of $ 1 million or more .\nOther states and cities launched promotions for vaccination ranging from free beer in New Jersey to raffles for full-ride college scholarships in New York and Ohio to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who took the jab .\n( The latter brought to , naturally , by people who sincerely care about your health . )\nWhen these nudges didn \u2019 t work , officials simply mandated the vaccines , with severe penalties for those who declined .\nAs my own institution , the University of California ,

"content": "A major new autopsy report has found that three people who died unexpectedly at home with no pre-existing disease shortly after COVID vaccination were likely killed by the vaccine .\nA further two deaths were found to be possibly due to the vaccine .\nThe report , published in Clinical Research in Cardiology , the official journal of the German Cardiac Society , detailed autopsies carried out at Heidelberg University Hospital in 2021 .\nLed by Thomas Longerich and Peter Schirmacher , it found that in five deaths that occurred within a week of the first or second dose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heart tissue due to an autoimmune response triggered by the vaccine had likely or possibly caused the death .\nIn total the report looked at 35 autopsies carried out at the University of Heidelberg in people who died within 20 days of COVID vaccination , of which 10 were deemed on examination to be due to a pre-existing illness and not the vaccine .\nFor the remaining 20 , the report did not rule out the vaccine as a cause of death , which Dr. Schirmacher has confirmed to me is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAlmost all of the remaining cases were of a cardiovascular cause , as indicated in the table below from the supplementary materials , where 21 of the 30 deaths are attributed to a cardiovascular cause .\nOne of these is attributed to blood clots ( VITT ) from AstraZeneca vaccination ( the report was looking specifically at post-vaccine myocarditis deaths ) , leaving 20 from other cardiovascular causes .\nFor the five deaths in the main report attributed as likely or possibly due to the vaccines , the authors state : This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths where there was no \u201c pre-existing , clinically relevant heart disease , \u201d making the report very conservative in which deaths it was willing to pin on the vaccines .\nWe included only cases , in which the constellation was unequivocally clear and no other cause of death was demonstrable despite all efforts .\nWe can not rule out vaccine effects in the other cases , but here we had an alternative potential cause of death ( e.g .\nmyocardial infarction , pulmonary embolism ) .\nIf there is severe ischemic cardiomyopathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myocarditis effects or definitively rule in inflammatory alterations as due to vaccination .\nThese cases were not included .\nWe did not aim to include or find every case but the characteristics of definitive , unequivocal cases beyond any doubt .\nOnly by this way you can establish the typical characteristics ; otherwise less strict criteria may lead to \u2018 contamination \u2019 of the collective ; it is absolutely plausible that by these criteria we may have missed further cases but the intention of our study was never quantitative or extrapolation and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we wanted to establish the fact not the size .\nIt is of course very possible that the vaccines also cause death where there is an underlying cardiovascular condition , and indeed , that it is more likely to do so .\nThus these five deaths are the minimum from these autopsy cases in which the vaccines are involved\u2014those in which there is no other plausible explanation .\nIt is worth noting here that initially in 2021 , when the autopsies were first carried out , Dr. Schirmacher stated that his team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were due to the vaccines .\nThese earlier estimates may give us a better indication of how many of the deaths the authors really think are attributable to the vaccines , when they are unconstrained by highly conservative assumptions ( and looking at causes besides myocarditis ) .\nNote that these percentages are based on a selection of deaths that occurred shortly after vaccination , not a random sample of all deaths , so the authors rightly warn that no estimation of individual risk can be made from them .\nDid the autopsies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the heart tissue ?\nThe samples from the five vaccine-attributed deaths were tested for infectious agents including SARS-CoV-2 ( in one instance revealing \u201c low viral copy numbers \u201d of a herpes virus , which the authors deemed insufficient to explain the inflammation ) .\nHowever , no tests were done specifically for the virus spike protein or nucleocapsid protein , such as have been used successfully in other autopsies to aid attribution to the vaccine , so unfortunately this evidence was unavailable for these autopsies .\nThe autopsies in the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not any booster doses , and only deaths within 20 days of vaccination , so the report doesn \u2019 t address directly the question of what \u2019 s been causing the elevated heart deaths since the booster rollouts from autumn 2021 or whether the vaccines can trigger cardiovascular death weeks or months later .\n( Other autopsies have confirmed that the spike protein can persist in the body for weeks or months after vaccination and trigger a fatal autoimmune attack on the heart . )\nWhat the report does do , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly in the days immediately following vaccination may well have died from a vaccine-related autoimmune attack on the heart .\nIt also confirms how deadly even mild vaccine-induced myocarditis can be\u2014and thus why studies like the one from Thailand , finding cardiovascular adverse effects in around a third of teenagers ( 29.2 percent ) following Pfizer vaccination and subclinical heart inflammation in one in 43 ( 2.3 percent ) , and the study from Switzerland finding at least 2.8 percent with subclinical myocarditis and elevated troponin levels ( indicating heart injury ) across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe authors of the new study diplomatically write that the \u201c reported incidence \u201d of myocarditis after vaccination is \u201c low \u201d and the risks of hospitalization and death associated with COVID-19 are \u201c stated to be greater than the recorded risk associated with COVID-19 vaccination \u201d \u2014notably declining to commit themselves to the official propositions that they dutifully repeat .\nThe fact that those who die suddenly after vaccination may have died from the hidden effects of the COVID vaccine on their heart is thus now

for developing shingles or herpes zoster ( HZ ) .\nThe authors pointed out that \u201c an association of HZ with COVID vaccination has been reported worldwide \u201d and concluded that \u201c the

vaccines.5 Recently , there have been wide-spread reports of VZ virus reactivating after receiving a COVID shot , especially with messenger RNA ( mRNA ) technology such as Pfizer/BioNTech \u2019 s Comirnaty and Moderna/NIAID \u2019 s Spikevax biologics.6 Some experts have speculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varicella zoster and COVID shots could be due to the changes in immune system function after vaccination .\nRisk factors for getting shingles include being older , undergoing severe stress and a weakened immune system .\nStudy Included Millions of People Who Did and Did Not Get COVID Shots The study looked at real world data of 1,095,086 people , who received a COVID shot compared to 16,966,018 people who did not get the shot and visited a clinic within the TriNetX Global Health Research Network database .\nThe Network database aggregates data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the subjects were matched for age and gender .\nThe vaccinated group visited the clinic for the purpose of being vaccinated , while the unvaccinated group went to the clinic for another reason .\nStudy results revealed that the vaccinated group had a 20 percent chance of coming down with shingles post COVID

highly significant.7 The SARS-CoV-2 virus , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has also been found to cause shingles .\nNumerous case reports indicated that SARS-CoV-2 infections could trigger reactivation of the VZ virus and researchers have hypothesized that it is linked to the physical and psychological stress of the body trying to deal with the SARS-CoV-2 infection.9 The journal Open Forum Infectious Diseases published a large study in 2022 comparing 400,000 people who had SARS-CoV-2 to 1.6 million people who have not had the viral infection .\nAdults over the age of 50 who had been infected with SARS-CoV02 had a 15 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the next six months .\nPatients who had severe cases of COVID requiring hospitalization had a 21 percent risk of developing shingles.10 Another Study Indicates Shingles May be a Side Effect of COVID Shots A study published by Israeli researchers in 2021 in the British Society of Rheumatology showed that shingles could be a side effect of COVID shots .\nThe observational study evaluated adverse events following COVID vaccination in subjects suffering from autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease ( AIIRD ) and compared 491 patients with AIIRD to 99 control subjects , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two rheumatology departments in Israel.11 12 In the AIIRS group , six female subjects developed shingles post vaccination ( 1.2 percent ) compared to zero subjects developing shingles in the control group .\nFive of the six women came down with shingles after a first COVID shot and one after the second dose .\nAll shingles cases were mild and resolved within six weeks.13 Patients Who Received Three Different COVID Shots Developed Shingles This year , the journal Family Practice also published a report of three case studies of patients ( one male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with shingles three to 13 days after receiving three different types of COVID shots.14 All three patients were between 67-79 years old , were overweight or obese , and had hypertension and dyslipidemia ( abnormal amount of lipids in the blood ) in their medical history .\nOne patient had recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection a year before receiving a COVID shot and did not develop shingles following that COVID infection .\nAll patients received different COVID shots , including Comirnaty , Spikevax , and AstraZeneca/Oxford University \u2019 s Vaxzevria , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doses despite developing shingles after the first dose.15 Study authors hypothesized surmise that \u201c an altered immune landscape involving cellular immunity might be implicated in this phenomenon.\n\u201d 16 Immune System Depression Post Vaccination May Set Stage for Reactivation of Varicella Virus A May 2022 study looked at 10 case studies of shingles that occurred one to three weeks after COVID vaccination .\nThe authors speculated that , similar to COVID infections , transient immunomodulation following vaccination could result in reactivation of the HZ virus .\nMore specifically , they proposed that lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T cells , and natural killer cells could set the stage for reactivation of HZ and development of shingles.17 Complications from shingles include postherpetic neuralgia ; ophthalmicus ( painful rash in the fifth cranial nerve shared by the eye ) ; acute retinal necrosis ( death of eye tissue ) ; Ramsay Hunt syndrome ( facial paralysis near the ear and hearing loss ) ; Bell \u2019 s palsy and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome , which involve paralysis of the face or limbs ) ; encephalitis ( brain inflammation ) , aseptic meningitis ( inflammation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( inflammation of the spinal cord ) ; peripheral motor neuropathy ( damage to nerves that control muscles ) , and bacterial skin infection.18 The study authors noted that reactivation of the herpes virus is a rare complication of other vaccines , most notably influenza , hepatitis A , rabies , Japanese encephalitis and yellow fever vaccines and that , while research is limited so far , the COVID shots can likely be added to this list .\nThey warned : A Decrease in Lymphocytes May Play Role in Shingles Post Vaccination COVID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition whereby blood doesn \u2019 t have a sufficient number of lymphocytes ( white blood cells ) to help the immune system protect the body from infection.20 21 Symptoms of lymphopenia may include swollen lymph nodes , spleen and joints ; fever ; skin ras ; frequent infections or inability to heal from an infection .\nAll types of white blood cells decrease but CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes tend to decrease the most and this T-lymphocyte impairment could lead to shingles .\nThe Pfizer/BioNTech COVID mRNA shot trials showed that there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days after receiving the shot .\nAt the currently used dose , up to 46 percent of the trial study participants had a transient decrease in lymphocytes count to below 1\u00d710.9 The trial authors speculated that it is during this window of time when lymphocyte counts are lowered that the VZ virus can reactivate in the body.22 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week , click here .", "author": "Marco

.\nStudy results revealed that the vaccinated group had a 20 percent chance of coming down with shingles post Covid vaccination while the unvaccinated group had 11 percent odds of developing the painful virus within 60 days of visiting the clinic .\nThe study authors concluded that the difference was statistically highly significant.7 The SARS-CoV-2 virus , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has also been found to cause shingles .\nNumerous case reports indicated that SARS-CoV-2 infections could trigger reactivation of the VZ virus and researchers have hypothesized that it is linked to the physical and psychological stress of the body trying to deal with the SARS-CoV-2 infection.9 The journal Open Forum Infectious Diseases published a large study in 2022 comparing 400,000 people who had SARS-CoV-2 to 1.6 million people who have not had the viral infection .\nAdults over the age of 50 who had been infected with SARS-CoV02 had a 15 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the next six months .\nPatients who had severe cases of Covid requiring hospitalization had a 21 percent risk of developing shingles.10 Another Study Indicates Shingles May be a Side Effect of COVID Shots A study published by Israeli researchers in 2021 in the British Society of Rheumatology showed that shingles could be a side effect of Covid shots .\nThe observational study evaluated adverse events following Covid vaccination in subjects suffering from autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease ( AIIRD ) and compared 491 patients with AIIRD to 99 control subjects , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two rheumatology departments in Israel.11 12 In the AIIRS group , six female subjects developed shingles post vaccination ( 1.2 percent ) compared to zero subjects developing shingles in the control group .\nFive of the six women came down with shingles after a first Covid shot and one after the second dose .\nAll shingles cases were mild and resolved within six weeks.13 Patients Who Received Three Different COVID Shots Developed Shingles This year , the journal Family Practice also published a report of three case studies of patients ( one male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with shingles three to 13 days after receiving three different types of Covid shots.14 All three patients were between 67-79 years old , were overweight or obese , and had hypertension and dyslipidemia ( abnormal amount of lipids in the blood ) in their medical history .\nOne patient had recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection a year before receiving a Covid shot and did not develop shingles following that Covid infection .\nAll patients received different Covid shots , including Comirnaty , Spikevax , and AstraZeneca/Oxford University \u2019 s Vaxzevria , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doses despite developing shingles after the first dose.15 Study authors hypothesized surmise that \u201c an altered immune landscape involving cellular immunity might be implicated in this phenomenon.\n\u201d 16 Immune System Depression Post Vaccination May Set Stage for Reactivation of Varicella Virus A May 2022 study looked at 10 case studies of shingles that occurred one to three weeks after Covid vaccination .\nThe authors speculated that , similar to Covid infections , transient immunomodulation following vaccination could result in reactivation of the HZ virus .\nMore specifically , they proposed that lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T cells , and natural killer cells could set the stage for reactivation of HZ and development of shingles.17 Complications from shingles include postherpetic neuralgia ; ophthalmicus ( painful rash in the fifth cranial nerve shared by the eye ) ; acute retinal necrosis ( death of eye tissue ) ; Ramsay Hunt syndrome ( facial paralysis near the ear and hearing loss ) ; Bell \u2019 s palsy and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome , which involve paralysis of the face or limbs ) ; encephalitis ( brain inflammation ) , aseptic meningitis ( inflammation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( inflammation of the spinal cord ) ; peripheral motor neuropathy ( damage to nerves that control muscles ) , and bacterial skin infection.18 The study authors noted that reactivation of the herpes virus is a rare complication of other vaccines , most notably influenza , hepatitis A , rabies , Japanese encephalitis and yellow fever vaccines and that , while research is limited so far , the Covid shots can likely be added to this list .\nThey warned : A Decrease in Lymphocytes May Play Role in Shingles Post Vaccination Covid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition whereby blood doesn \u2019 t have a sufficient number of lymphocytes ( white blood cells ) to help the immune system protect the body from infection.20 21 Symptoms of lymphopenia may include swollen lymph nodes , spleen and joints ; fever ; skin ras ; frequent infections or inability to heal from an infection .\nAll types of white blood cells decrease but CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes tend to decrease the most and this T-lymphocyte impairment could lead to shingles .\nThe Pfizer/BioNTech Covid mRNA shot trials showed that there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days after receiving the shot .\nAt the currently used dose , up to 46 percent of the trial study participants had a transient decrease in lymphocytes count to below 1\u00d710.9 The trial authors speculated that it is during this window of time when lymphocyte counts are lowered that the VZ virus can reactivate in the body.22 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week , click here .", "author": "Marco Caceres", "url":
