and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconciliation with both of them for decades .\nNow , however , Russia \u2019 s President Putin wants to subdue Ukraine , destroying its culture and identity .\nPresident Putin even equates his barbaric war of aggression with the fight against National Socialism .\nThis is historically falsified and infamous .\nIt is our duty to state this clearly .\nBut it \u2019 s not done

people in Germany .\nIn 2021 , depression and eating disorders continued to rise among adolescents between the ages of 15 and 17 .\nGirls with mental illnesses were treated as inpatients significantly more often than boys .\nAt primary school age , there was a noticeable increase in disorders of social functions and an increase in developmental disorders .\nThis is the result of the analysis of current hospital data from DAK-Gesundheit for the Children and Youth Report 2022 .\nDAK CEO Andreas Storm and the professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political action in view of the dramatic development .\nFor the report , scientists from Vandage and the University of Bielefeld examined anonymized billing data from around 800,000 children and young people aged up to 17 who are insured with DAK-Gesundheit .\nThe years 2019 to 2021 were analyzed .\nThe data shows that girls in their late teens in particular are suffering massively from the effects of the pandemic .\nGirls between the ages of 15 and 17 were more than 32 times more likely to be hospitalized for eating disorders than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pandemic .\nThe proportion of young patients with eating disorders increased by 25 percent in 2021

right way to further analyze the problems and implement the first measures during this legislative period .\nIt is about the future health of an entire generation.\n\u201d Eating disorders @ @ @ @ @ @

with depression and 17 percent more teenagers aged 17 and higher with eating disorders came to the clinics .\nIn relation to 2019 , hospital stays for eating disorders increased by 40 percent in 2021 .\nThere was also an increase in treatments for emotional disorders : in 2021 , 42 percent more 15 to 17-year-olds received inpatient treatment due to emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears such as separation anxiety , social anxiety , or phobic disorders , for example , fear of imaginary figures .\nHowever , the number of cases remained below the number of cases of depressive episodes and eating disorders .\nThere were similar tendencies among school children between the ages of ten and fourteen .\nThe main increase here was in-patient treatment for depression ( up 27 percent ) , anxiety disorders ( up 25 percent ) , and eating disorders ( up 21 percent ) .\n\u201c The DAK report shows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and psychosomatic abnormalities , issues , and illnesses have become in our society , especially

school children : more disorders of social functions and developmental disorders The data from the children and youth report also shows that primary school children primarily suffer from disorders of

area , \u201d says Dr. Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pediatricians .\n\u201c Children and young people are just as vulnerable within the population as old or previously ill citizens during the corona
