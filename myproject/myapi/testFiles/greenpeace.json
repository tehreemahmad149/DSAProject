worst year yet for the climate crisis , so it \u2019 s fitting that the # 1 movie on streaming giant Netflix is a thinly-veiled satire about climate change .\nAdam McKay \u2019 s star-studded Don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large comet on a collision course with Earth to represent the very real climate threats we \u2019 re facing .\nThe astronomers in the film try to alert the media to the urgency and implore the U.S. president to take action before it \u2019 s too late .\nHowever , they are routinely ignored .\nThe film is inspiring impassioned conversations around both the climate crisis itself and how we talk about it .\nThis makes sense , as the characters in the movie struggle with how to present their findings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the movie itself is a big budget piece of climate communication .\nIt \u2019 s thrilling to see so many folks engage with these topics .\nOne question we keep getting asked is , \u201c So , how accurate is Don \u2019 t Look Up ?\n\u201d Let \u2019 s take a look at how the comet crisis in the film compares to the climate crisis in our world .\nSPOILER ALERT : major Don \u2019 t Look Up details below !\nHow does Don \u2019 t Look Up \u2018 s Comet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nCOMET : Scientists discover the comet and identify the threat .\nCLIMATE : Scientists have been tracking climate change for decades , but Indigenous communities have been tracking it for centuries .\nCOMET : A comet will collide with Earth in exactly 6 months and 14 days .\nCLIMATE : Climate change is more insidious than a simple countdown to destruction .\nGradual changes are harder to observe .\nA simple countdown to destruction would be easier to explain .\nCOMET : The comet is a looming threat that doesn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : In many ways , the climate crisis is already here .\nCOMET : The comet will wipe out all human life on the planet .\nCLIMATE : Climate change won \u2019 t affect everyone at the same time , and the effects will not be evenly distributed across people .\nCOMET : The U.S. President could save everyone if they believed the scientists .\nCLIMATE : The climate crisis is a collective problem that will require collective solutions .\nIt \u2019 s not solely a U.S. issue and can \u2019 t be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The media doesn \u2019 t care about a fast-approaching planet-killing comet because it \u2019 s too sad of a story .\nCLIMATE : Climate journalism has come a long way in the last five years , and there are many amazing climate journalists !\nBut often , the mainstream media doesn \u2019 t capture the urgency of the crisis and are too willing to take polluting corporations at their word .\nCOMET : Science communication is really hard to do well .\nCLIMATE : Don \u2019 t we know it !\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit into a neat three act structure , there \u2019 s no silver bullet , and no individual hero to save the day at the final hour .\nCOMET : The U.S. can solve the threat by launching nuclear weapons at the comet .\nCLIMATE : We know how to solve climate change , but it will take a global effort .\nIt will require action from ALL people .\nCOMET : Tech billionaires won \u2019 t save us from the comet .\nCLIMATE : Tech billionaires won \u2019 t save us from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planet aren \u2019 t as motivated to solve the crisis since they \u2019 ll be amongst the last to feel it .\nCOMET : Celebrities are bad because they distract \u2018 everyday \u2019 people from the comet .\nCLIMATE : The fault for the climate crisis rests on corporations and governments , not individuals .\nAlso , people can be interested in more than one thing at a time .\nOn top of this , celebrities often use their platforms to highlight the climate crisis .\nSee : Jane Fonda and Fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrities in Don \u2019 t Look Up !\nCOMET : They have a better shot at resolving the comet crisis if they act quickly .\nWaiting will require much more drastic measures .\nCLIMATE : We have a better shot at resolving the climate crisis if we act quickly .\nWaiting will require much more drastic measures .\nCOMET : All we need to do is believe scientists .\nCLIMATE : To solve climate change we need to believe not only scientists , but also Indigenous people and communities on the frontline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are already experiencing climate change .\nCOMET : We \u2019 re all going to die !\nCLIMATE : We know that swift collective action can be taken .\nFor example , we have seen people , governments , and corporations drastically change their ways of life to deal with the covid pandemic .\nIt \u2019 s not too late , but we need your help Satire doesn \u2019 t require absolute accuracy to be effective .\n( It wouldn \u2019 t be satire if it did . )\nWhile the movie simplifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resonated with many people on an emotional level .\nWe want everyone to know that we still have time to solve the climate crisis.\u2014but we need each of you to join the fight .\nWe won \u2019 t even ask you

fields with farmworkers near Bakersfield .\nI wanted to know more about the struggle against extractivism , especially the role farmworkers play in that fight .\nFacing the simultaneous challenges of fossil fuel racism and being in the center of the climate crisis ( experiencing extreme heat , fires , climate migration ) , California farmworker communities are facing interconnected and deliberate

million Californian \u2019 s live within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oil drilling site , and of those 69 % are Black , Indigenous , Latinx , and people of color .\nLate in 2021 , California Governor Newsom announced there will be a rule implemented requiring a 3200 foot setback distance for new oil extraction sites .\nWhile this is good news , frontline communities are still dealing with the repercussions of existing sites of oil drilling right next to their homes and schools .\nThe Bakersfield area is home to many climate refugees and agricultural workers escaping harsh conditions in Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are often working in just as bad conditions in California .\nFrom the toxic air quality because of oil and gas extraction sites near agricultural fields and homes , to harmful pesticides and contaminated water .\nWith increasing fires and heat waves , communities who live and work in California ( like farmworkers ) put their lives at risk every day and many do so with little or no protection .\nSmoke from climate-driven fires are connected to so many illnesses and hospitalizations .\nWatch the episode to learn more : So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of Californians

\u2019 s alarming choice to allow the largest sale of public waters for offshore oil drilling in U.S. history This goes against Biden \u2019 s campaign promises but , we can still stop it and we need

public lands for drilling by oil and gas corporations including ExxonMobil and BP in the Gulf of Mexico ( Lease Sale 257 ) .\nIt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offshore drilling in U.S. history .\nThis not only goes against Biden \u2019 s campaign promises , but also\u2026 We know that fossil fuel production creates pollution and negative health impacts across every step of the supply chain .\nAND we know that these impacts are often racist in terms of where , and who , is subject to this pollution .\nThe Gulf of Mexico has seen far too many disastrous oil spills and gas leaks that poison Gulf residents and the surrounding ecosystem .\nSupporting continued fossil fuel infrastructure development is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects hurt even more than the communities near them .\nThis sale will unleash greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 112 million cars or 130 coal-powered plants .\nThat is a death sentence when we need to significantly reduce emissions now .\nBut to push the sale forward , the Department of the Interior outrageously claims that Lease Sale 257 will have no impact on climate change or the environment .\nThe National Environmental Protection Act ( NEPA ) requires federal agencies to take a hard look at the environmental consequences of their proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of the Interior \u2019 s decision to move forward with the sale may be based on incorrect and inaccurate information about its impact on climate change and the environment could be a direct violation of NEPA .\nWe think the Biden administration should review these bids to ensure that the full scope of potential damage and harm to the Gulf environment and its people were taken into account .\nBUT , we can still stop it and we need to act now !\nA lawsuit has been filed in DC District Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of the Interior .\nIf successful , it would reverse the lease sale before they come into effect in February 2022 .\nHowever , President Biden and Secretary Haaland don \u2019 t have to wait for the court \u2019 s decision .\nThe Interior Secretary has the authority to reject bids received during the lease sale .\nAnd the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act ( OCSLA ) gives the Interior Secretary clear authority to suspend and ultimately cancel a lease at any time if activity would cause serious harm or damage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the environment .\nThere is no doubt in our minds that Secretary Haaland must cancel Lease Sale 257 in order to protect those living in the Gulf \u2014 particularly the Black and Indigenous peoples and communities of color who will be most impacted by the climate disasters this sale guarantees .\nWe must now mobilize to pressure President Biden and Secretary Haaland .\nTake action today !", "author": "Kaitlin Grable", "url":

years , Greenpeace has put hope into action with the backing of millions of supporters .\nWorking alongside movement allies and local communities around the world , we have helped achieve meaningful

huge\u2014but so are the reasons to be hopeful !\nAs we keep pushing for the safer , more equitable future that we need , let \u2019 s draw inspiration from these signs of the progress that people power has already achieved : \u2022 People are winning in courts : Movement-led climate court cases are bringing justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate litigation cases have nearly doubled , and only last year , an unprecedented number of key judgments with potentially far-reaching impacts were issued , including on the cases against Shell and against Germany .\n\u2022 Indigenous-led resistance is stopping pipelines : In the United States and Canada , 21 fossil fuel projects have been prevented or delayed by Indigenous-led resistance .\nThat \u2019 s the equivalent of 400 coal-fired power plants \u2019 worth of pollution , according to analysis from the Indigenous Environmental Network ( IEN ) and Oil Change International .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees a pathway to 1.5\u00b0C : The IEA , a body created to ensure the security of oil supplies , sees an energy system dominated by solar and wind , coming with \u201c huge benefits \u201d .\nThe group has big influence on business and investment strategies and now says there should be absolutely no investment in new fossil fuel supply projects , and no further final investment decisions for new unabated coal plants , and by 2035 no sales of new cars running on oil .\n\u2022 Solar and wind have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the world , and costs continue to decline .\n\u2022 The financial sector has finally started to wake up : Some of the world \u2019 s largest bond purchasers and asset owners are now pursuing to align their strategies with the Paris Agreement and 1.5\u00b0C limit .\nTop global investors are moving away from the massive climate-related risks associated with fossil fuels , into building renewable energy .\n\u2022 Some of the business strategies are starting to look different : Car companies are announcing combustion engine phase outs , energy utilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant announced cuts in their oil and gas production .\n\u2022 Scientists confirm there is still time to make a big difference : The latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , a group of the \u200b\u200bworld \u2019 s top climate scientists convened by the United Nations , confirms not only that human influence has unequivocally warmed the climate but also that we still have time to stave off the worst-case warming scenarios if we achieve rapid and widespread reductions in carbon emissions .\nWe know what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it .\nNone of this is enough .\nNot even close .\nNot yet .\nBut all of it points to potential for change .\nIt gives us reason to keep hoping and to keep putting that hope into action .\nRemember that most of these developments would have seemed impossible just a few years ago .\nWe are making progress .\nNow we must speed up and scale up for good , with massive public pressure .\nIn order to do that we must maintain and preserve our reservoirs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial agriculture and oceans from deep sea mining .\nHope is not a strategy\u2014but it \u2019 s still a necessity .\nWe need to believe we will win , if we are going to practice the radical honesty , empathy , and creativity needed to move beyond incremental action toward complete system change .\nBut

work is disappearing \u2014 and feeling like if you could just make politicians understand , you could turn things around !\nScientists have a reputation for being unable or unwilling to speak clearly about the implications of their research .\nWhen it comes to climate change , though , that is starting to change quickly .\nAbout 15 years ago , I lived in Texas , where I had some truly awful meetings with congressional offices about climate change .\nI remember one guy saying the best thing we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build more roads , so cars wouldn \u2019 t be stuck in traffic .\nFor most

absolutely clear .\nScientists often feel a need to add caveats that make it sound like they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enables industry to pretend the findings are in doubt .\nPublicity is pretty scary for many scientists , because their work and their institutions are often funded by industry .\nWhen the fishing industry gives millions of dollars to your program , you are going to be very careful about

themselves against harmful chemicals , and fight for fair wages .\nI saw the incredible struggles in places like Imokelee , Florida ( where farmworkers created a successful campaign to fight for fair

pledging a return to U.S. climate leadership at COP26 , President Biden and Interior Secretary Deb Haaland allowed a sale of 80 million acres of public lands for drilling by oil and gas corporations including ExxonMobil and BP in the Gulf of Mexico ( Lease Sale 257 ) .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for offshore drilling in U.S. history .\nThis not only goes against President Biden \u2019 s campaign promises

continued fossil fuel infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these projects hurt even more than the communities near them .\nThis sale will unleash greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 112 million cars or 130 coal-powered plants .\nThat is a death sentence when we need to significantly reduce emissions now .\nBut to push the sale forward , the Department of the Interior outrageously claims that Lease Sale 257 will have no impact on climate change or the environment .\nThe National Environmental Protection Act ( NEPA ) requires federal agencies to take a hard look at the environmental consequences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Department of the Interior \u2019 s decision to move forward with the sale may be based on incorrect and inaccurate information about its impact on climate change and the environment could be a direct violation of NEPA .\nWe think the Biden administration should review these bids to ensure that the full scope of potential damage and harm to the Gulf environment and its people were taken into account .\nBUT , we can still stop it and we need to act now !\nA lawsuit has been filed in DC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Department of the Interior .\nIf successful , it would reverse the lease sale before they come into effect in February 2022 .\nHowever , President Biden and Secretary Haaland don \u2019 t have to wait for the court \u2019 s decision .\nThe Interior Secretary has the authority to reject bids received during the lease sale .\nAnd the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act ( OCSLA ) gives the Interior Secretary clear authority to suspend and ultimately cancel a lease at any time if activity would cause serious harm or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security , and the environment .\nThere is no doubt in our minds that Secretary Haaland must cancel Lease Sale 257 in order to protect those living in the Gulf \u2014 particularly the Black and Indigenous peoples and communities of color who will be most impacted by the climate disasters this sale guarantees .\nWe must now mobilize to pressure President Biden and Secretary Haaland .\nTake action today !", "author": "Kaitlin Grable", "url":

House Oversight Committee \u2019 s hearings remind us that Big Oil and their allies in Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to reduce emissions and address climate change .\nInstead , they only show regard for maximizing profits for as long as possible regardless of the environmental and health impacts .\nThe United States is the largest historical emitter of greenhouse gasses , meaning we are responsible for a large share of the warming that has happened to date .\nThe U.S. is also the world \u2019 s largest oil and gas producer , and we export these fossil fuels to other countries .\nWe must lead by example if the world stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limiting warming to 1.5\u2070 Celsius to avoid climate catastrophe and advancing environmental justice .\nThe United States must not only phase out producing and burning fossil fuels at home but also stop exporting them to be burned elsewhere .\nOne of the most important executive actions President Biden can take right now is declaring a climate emergency and reinstating the crude oil export ban .\nAs a candidate , President Biden emphatically agreed that he was ready to ban fossil fuel exports as part of a rapid and responsible phaseout of fossil fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exports by reinstating the crude oil export ban that was in place from 1973 to 2015 would be a major step in reining in out-of-control drilling in the United States .\nThe ban could lead to reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions of as much as 80 to 181 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent each year , which is comparable to closing between 19 and 42 coal-fired power plants .\nAccess to international markets has made possible some U.S. oil production that would not have been produced with a ban on exports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investments in new oil pipelines and export terminal projects .\nThe CEO of one of the nation \u2019 s largest crude exporters made the connection very succinctly : \u201c Without the crude oil export ban repeal , the United States would not be producing half of the oil it is today because it could not be exported.\n\u201d Reinstating the oil export ban could reverse this process , taking some domestic oil drilling projects off the table and potentially redirecting investment dollars from oil to renewable energy .\nExport restrictions were the norm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ban would simply correct an error that has deepened the climate crisis and made the needed transformation of the U.S. energy system significantly more difficult .\nThe surge of oil and gas production in recent years has placed the planet and local communities at great risk , and President Biden must act swiftly to rein in this expansion and align U.S. energy policy with climate limits .\nThe heart of the U.S. oil and gas boom is in the Permian Basin .\nSituated over approximately 6,000 square miles in west Texas and Southeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the largest carbon bombs on the planet .\nEffectively every new barrel of oil that is produced is exported because U.S. refiners can not process more Permian crude , causing substantial , unnecessary harm to communities and the climate .\nIf the dozens of proposed fossil fuel export projects under federal jurisdiction are built , Gulf Coast communities will suffer acute , significant impacts of added pollution , and then take a double hit when climate disasters strike .\nThe urgency of this phaseout is imperative for Gulf Coast communities that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season and 2021 \u2019 s infrastructure-crippling deep freeze , which led to the deaths of over 240 people .\nThe bottom line is we can not allow the expansion of fossil fuels and limit global warming at the same time .\nWe must implement strong policies to phase out fossil fuel production while ensuring that the livelihoods of industry workers and communities are protected and improved in the transition to a renewable energy economy .\nThe only way to avoid climate catastrophe is to phase out fossil fuels as rapidly as possible .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow through on the promises he has made to the American people , and the world , by demonstrating the true climate leadership that science and

from threats like industrial fishing , oil and gas drilling , or deep-sea mining ?\nSometimes , a submarine is the best way to show people what is at stake .\nIn 2017 , several oil companies were preparing to drill off the coast of Brazil .\nOutside of a few environmentalists and local activists , there was very little controversy or even awareness about their plans .\nWhen Greenpeacers from around the world showed up in January with the Arctic Sunrise , a two-person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazilian scientists , we knew we had very little time \u2013 the oil companies expected to begin drilling by March or April .\nInstead , images of rare and beautiful creatures from the Amazon Reef were shared all over the world , helping galvanize a movement strong enough to stop Big Oil in its tracks .\nFive years later , drilling plans have largely been abandoned .\nThe same is true in the U.S. Arctic , where the Greenpeace ship The Esperanza brought a submarine to the site of Shell \u2019 s proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft corals , which did not appear in Shell \u2019 s Environmental Impact Assessment .\nThat added to the challenges Shell was already facing , and today the company \u2019 s hopes of drilling in the area seem very unlikely to come to pass .\nIt is hard to believe that it has been twelve years since the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster dumped over two hundred million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico .\nThe US government worked closely with BP to control access to the area , and to downplay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our global network worked with scientists from over a dozen institutions to assess the true scope and impact of the spill on the Gulf ecosystem , and a submarine was a valuable tool to show what things looked like on the seafloor .\nWe were relieved to

asphalt parking lot , with no living creatures in sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DeepWorker sub to the Antarctic Peninsula .\nThe Southern Ocean is a pretty challenging place to work , but we managed to pull off eight successful dives .\nThe corals and sponges we documented led to the designation of four new Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems , which are now closed to all fishing .\nThe dives also helped policymakers realize the importance of ocean sanctuaries .\nIf we found large numbers of fragile , habitat-forming creatures in half of our dives , how many more vulnerable areas must there be out there ?\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and part of that means setting aside large areas free from drilling or fishing that can help minimize the chances that humans break things at a scale that can not be fixed .\nThe Greenpeace network \u2019 s first use of submarines was in the Bering Sea , where we were working to protect the world \u2019 s largest underwater canyons .\nThe canyons were \u2013 and still are \u2013 ground zero for one of the largest fisheries on earth .\nAlaska pollock , a cod relative that are ground up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and McDonald \u2019 s sandwiches , are caught by massive factory trawlers that often drag their nets along the bottom .\nWhen we suggested that this was a dangerous type of fishing to allow in the canyons , the fishing industry insisted that there was nothing down there but mud and silt .\nOf course , they knew better than that ; bycatch records revealed that tons of corals and sponges were pulled up in their nets .\nBut it took the work we did with submarines to force policymakers to even consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and public engagement has always been a part of the Greenpeace global network \u2019 s approach .\nUsing the Greenpeace ships to deploy submarines in areas at immediate risk from industrial activity is the kind of bearing witness our Quaker-inspired founders would understand .\nWe can not afford to use the subs everywhere , but if we are smart about picking our battles , they can be powerful tools to help people think differently about our oceans , and about the decisions , we make about how they should be used .", "author": "Heather

Up So you \u2019 ve heard Greenpeace USA is talking about Bitcoin , now ?\nOur senior campaigner , Rolf Skar , answers our questions about this new coalition-driven campaign and why it is so critical to keeping our planet and communities safe from the worst effects of climate change .\nHi Rolf , thanks for taking the time today .\nLet \u2019 s start at the beginning .\nWhat is Bitcoin ?\nBitcoin is a digital currency that works without a centralized bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c peer-to-peer \u201d system that allows people to pay for goods and services or simply invest in it with the hope that it will increase in value .\nWhen Bitcoin launched in 2009 , it was revolutionary , inspiring the creation and use of other \u201c cryptocurrencies \u201d ( like Bitcoin ) and financial tools based on technologies called blockchain which independently verify each and every transaction , almost like a bank would but without the bank .\nThese transparent digital \u201c ledgers \u201d document every transaction ever made on the system .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c will this check bounce ?\n\u201d ) or the approval of a bank or government to guarantee transactions between parties .\nTo update and maintain this ledger , Bitcoin \u201c miners \u201d employ specialized high-speed computers and are rewarded with newly minted digital coins , which can be highly lucrative .\nWoah that \u2019 s a lot of new terminology , thanks .\nWhy is it that all of a sudden I \u2019 m hearing a ton about Bitcoin , and why is Greenpeace USA talking about it ?\nThere are lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good investment ?\nIs this the future of money , or is it all a scam ?\nWe are not weighing in on those questions .\nOne thing we do know is that the Bitcoin system \u2019 s use of electricity is skyrocketing .\nThat is because of the way Bitcoin works .\nIts code uses a deliberately laborious \u201c Proof of Work \u201d ( PoW ) protocol to build security into its system .\nTechnical details aside , PoW is a lot of what it sounds like .\nIt depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , by specialized , power-hungry digital mining machines .\nAs the machines get faster , they compete against each other in a technological arms race .\nAs that happens , the system adjusts , upping the amount of work required as mining machines get faster .\nThe code is wasteful by design .\nIt uses all the work to make it too hard for its record of transactions and holdings to be compromised by bad guys .\nSo\u2026 Bitcoin is \u201c wasteful by design \u201d and that means ?\nExactly what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it exists today \u2013 is BAD for our planet and communities .\nFor years Bitcoin \u2019 s electricity use was relatively small .\nAs the value of Bitcoin increased and as faster , specialized machines took over the mining process , its electricity consumption has sky-rocketed .\nAccording to researchers at the University of Cambridge , Bitcoin \u2019 s electricity usage is comparable to that of many mid-sized countries\u2013like Sweden .\nIn too many cases , that electricity is being generated by burning climate-polluting fossil fuels .\nIf this trend continues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a lot worse .\nAs climate scientists have been telling us for years , we need to rapidly phase out the use of fossil fuels , but we are seeing many Bitcoin mining operations do the exact opposite .\nWhat Can Be Done About Bitcoin \u2019 s Energy Use ?\nBitcoin \u2019 s \u201c Proof of Work \u201d ( PoW ) protocol was revolutionary in 2009 , but it is now having unintended consequences for our climate and our future .\nThankfully , Bitcoin \u2019 s code can be updated to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PoW by shifting to a \u201c Proof of Stake \u201d ( PoS ) approach which could use 99 % LESS energy .\nThis newer way of ensuring security and transparency is already used by most other cryptocurrencies .\nEthereum , another well-established digital currency , is in the process of switching from PoW to PoS .\nIf smaller cryptocurrencies are doing this , Bitcoin could too .\nThe technical challenges for Bitcoin to do the same can be surmounted .\nThe real problem is whether , in a decentralized system , enough people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happen .\nOK .\nI think I get it .\nBut what is Greenpeace USA doing to get Bitcoin to change the code ?\nWe launched a campaign with friends at Environmental Working Group and several groups battling Bitcoin mining facilities in their communities to push Bitcoin to change its software code to use far less energy .\nIn short : we \u2019 re pushing Bitcoin to change its code \u2013 not the climate .\nThe campaign website , www.cleanupbitcoin.com is where you can go to join us and learn more .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ your background , no matter how you feel about Bitcoin , to help build support for a code change that will make our planet and our communities safer from the destructive impacts of climate change .\nIf you are concerned about pollution , extinction , or the climate crisis , add your voice to a chorus to change the code .\nGot it .\nBut , a few more questions to make sure I understand .\nWhy can \u2019 t Bitcoin just use clean energy ?\nWhy not just use solar panels to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s certainly better than coal or gas .\nBut we already have a deficit of clean energy to power our homes , businesses and industry \u2013 things that can not quickly become more energy efficient .\nAnd when we look at not only the US , but at Bitcoin mining around the world , there \u2019 s no way to ensure fossil fuels and other polluting sources will \u2013 somehow \u2013 be magically phased out .\nLike a lot of things in our world , we can \u2019 t depend on partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhen China , previously the number one site of Bitcoin mining , banned the practice in 2021 , new mining operations popped up elsewhere almost overnight , and it became more polluting than ever .\nBanning Bitcoin mining in individual US states or the whole country would just move the problem somewhere else .\nWe can not just export our problems elsewhere , like rich countries have down with plastic waste for many years .\nWe share one climate , so emissions anywhere will affect people everywhere .\nThank you so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions .\nRemind me again how I can get involved ?\nIf you are concerned at all about pollution , extinction , or the climate crisis , we need you .\nYou can add your voice to help us Change the Code , Not the Climate by signing up on the campaign website , www.cleanupbitcoin.com .", "author": "chris eaton", "url":

Simple: Forced Labor.", "content": "The high seas .\nFor the uninitiated , a mere mention of the phrase throws up images of a vast never-ending expanse of pristine blue waters .\nFor those who have been paying attention , we know this vast expanse is far from pristine - threatened as it is by a toxic cocktail of climate change , plastic pollution , and the potential threat of deep-sea mining .\nAdd to this mix the wildly destructive practices involved in high seas commercial fishing and you know we \u2019 ve got a recipe for disaster .\nBy now , you have likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial-scale high seas fishing .\nThink of that iconic scene near the end of Finding Nemo \u2013 when the gang finds themselves caught in a monstrous purse seine net along with a school of tuna .\nWhile these fictional characters manage to escape , real fish in the ocean aren \u2019 t as lucky .\nIndustrial fishing practices like purse seining are driving down fish stocks by taking more fish than are replenished , even catching species that we don \u2019 t eat or use , and emptying out our oceans .\nBottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor are destroying everything in their path .\nBy now , we \u2019 ve all seen countless images of helpless turtles caught in drifting nets .\nBut did we know that in addition to being ecologically destructive , high seas industrial fishing is also largely unprofitable ?\nA recent study that used satellite data and machine learning to estimate high-seas fishing effort , costs , and benefits , found that up to 54 % of high seas fishing grounds would be unprofitable if not propped up by government subsidies and extremely low labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prop up several ecologically damaging and unprofitable industries ( *ahem* fossil fuels ) , so this is hardly surprising .\nWhile it \u2019 s easy to estimate the role that subsidies play in propping up this industry , it \u2019 s much more difficult to determine exactly how much of this industry is subsidized by low labor costs .\nThe secrecy and lack of data around labor costs meant that researchers had to work with low and high estimates to determine profitability .\nTheir calculations found that even with the lowest possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of the world \u2019 s high seas fishing grounds would be unprofitable , and with higher estimates , this would jump to a staggering 30 % .\nFor several years now , the global Greenpeace network has shone a light on the inhumane conditions faced by migrant fishers aboard high-seas fishing vessels .\nAs fish populations collapse and fishing vessels have to go further out at sea , transportation and refrigeration costs have increased .\nWhile these costs are fixed , labor costs are more flexible .\nThis is especially true far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of oversight render fishers , who are often migrants with few legal protections , more vulnerable to debt bondage , wage deductions , long working hours , and even physical abuse .\nShocking recent cases of deaths of fishers aboard vessels have further highlighted the extreme and systemic issues of forced labor in this industry .\nFor instance , the US Customs & Border Protection \u2019 s recent finding confirmed the occurrence of forced labor on a Taiwanese fishing vessel , the Da Wang , where a migrant fisher recently died after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vessel \u2019 s captain .\nFor all their efforts to cut labor costs , the profits vessel operators and owners claim are paltry compared to the brands and retailers who ultimately sell us fish in the grocery stores of the world \u2019 s richer nations .\nIn 2018 , tuna vessels worldwide netted $ 11 billion .\nYet grocery stores earned almost four times that amount from their sales of tuna products in the same year .\nOur local corporate grocer and tuna brands may not directly employ the migrant fishers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hauling thousands of pounds of tuna for over 16 hours a day , but their sourcing policies and business practices set the tone for the entire industry .\nThese companies have a responsibility to enact policies that ensure the fish they sell is not tainted by environmental and human rights abuses .\nBumble Bee , one of the largest tuna brands in the US , has recently been linked to these human rights abuses .\nIts parent company , FCF , admitted to sourcing tuna from the Da Wang , the aforementioned vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s time to hold Bumble Bee accountable .\nAdd your name to demand Bumble Bee take action to prevent human rights and environmental abuses in its supply chain

the Blue Hole", "content": "I write this from the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise , on the way back into port after nearly two months at sea .\nI have been on board as the submarine pilot , part of a crew leading Greenpeace global network expeditions to Antarctica and the Blue Hole , a biodiversity hotspot some 300 kilometers off the coast of Argentina .\nWe need to flip the way we think about our oceans .\nOur current approach is based on the very old belief that we can do what we want to the ocean without lasting impact , which science has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe damage we have done is severe , and in some aspects irreversible .\nOver four million fishing boats now remove about 84 million tons of wild animals \u2013 fish , crab , shrimp , and more \u2013 from our oceans each year .\nWe have eaten most of the world \u2019 s large fish , changing the structure of marine food webs .\nMany fisheries use gear that destroys the very habitat that sustains seafloor communities or is so indiscriminate that the amount of unwanted and wasted marine life hauled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch .\nInstead of assuming that everywhere should be open for fishing , we need to start from the assumption that the ocean deserves to be protected .\nWhere fishing is to be allowed , a vetting process must ensure that it happens in a way that maintains biodiversity , preserves vulnerable habitats , protects threatened populations , and prevents overfishing .\nWhen fishing is permitted , it must be done in a way that respects human rights , values the labor of fishers , and treats them with dignity .\nI write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the way back into port after nearly two months at sea .\nI have been on board as the submarine pilot , part of a crew leading Greenpeace global network expeditions to Antarctica and the Blue Hole , a biodiversity hotspot some 300 kilometers off the coast of Argentina .\nIn both places , we set out to document the seafloor habitats in hopes that people would share our view that these places are special enough to be worthy of protection .\nIn Antarctic waters , we managed to dive every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice conditions , and what we found will certainly inspire people to think differently about the rich life in those freezing dark depths .\nAt the Blue Hole , we were not so lucky .\nWe brought a ship , a submarine , and a very talented team to the Blue Hole for two weeks prepared to dive up to six hours a day surveying the seafloor .\nThe urgency of our work was shoved in our face every day , as we were surrounded by some 400 fishing vessels \u2013 bottom trawlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longliners casually killing endangered albatrosses and sharks , and a fleet of squid jiggers so large it can be seen from space .\nIt feels like understating things quite a bit to say that it was challenging to organize this expedition , particularly during a pandemic .\nIt was the first of its kind , as no one had ever attempted anything like it before .\nThat made it all the more heartbreaking when the combination of strong winds , high swells , and treacherous currents made it impossible to pull off even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But while our success in Antarctica was more immediately apparent , what felt like a failure at the Blue Hole may actually be more important for how we make decisions about the stewardship of our oceans .\nThe Blue Hole is clearly an important case \u2013 a highly productive ecosystem that is nearly unregulated , which has become a nexus of industrial fishing and human rights abuses .\nAs hard as we tried to survey the area , currently being severely impacted by fishing , it was not possible to do so .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the same boat , so to speak , as the vast majority of the world \u2019 s oceans .\nWe can not survey 361 million square kilometers of ocean .\nNo one can .\nGovernment representatives will soon meet at the United Nations in New York , where they are expected to finalize a new Global Ocean Treaty .\nThis is the best chance we will have for perhaps a generation to finally stop treating our oceans as if they can withstand unlimited fishing pressure , which of course they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , it will enable us to quickly establish a global network of fully protected sanctuaries .\nInstead of spending years or decades trying to convince policymakers that this or that area is worthy of protection , we will take a holistic approach grounded on the understanding that we need healthy oceans in order to have healthy civilizations .\nThe Blue Hole will be one of many vital ocean areas to benefit .\nSo will our climate , as intact marine ecosystems play a powerful role in sequestering carbon .\nWe need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oceans .\nMore than ever before , we need your

Director Folabi Olagbaju .\nIn March , we passed the mic to the highest level of leadership at Greenpeace USA , our very own co-Executive Director , Ebony Twilley Martin .\nListen to the full Episode here ( transcript below ) : Black Leadership by What We Need Now Ebony is the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greenpeace USA or for any national legacy environmental organization .\nThe interview , conducted by her mentee , Ishmael Herod , WWNN producer and former Greenpeace USA Senior Talent Acquisition Manager , and Avery Raines , Greenpeace USA Senior Digital Strategist , is equal parts unapologetic celebration of what we \u2019 ve accomplished and raw honesty about how much more must be done .\nRight before the interview starts , we hear Ebony processing the significance of her impact on Black staff at Greenpeace .\n\u201c I \u2019 m so excited to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my journey in Greenpeace\u2026 to see this\u2026It \u2019 s just like my wildest dreams come true.\n\u201d \u201c I think we have to be at the table .\nNot just there for visibility , but there for our strategies and there for our answers , and there to demand what it is we need because nobody else can tell us what we need but us .\nAnd we can \u2019 t cede space in that way .\n\u201c Oh , I \u2019 ma just let them fight for us , \u201d No .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Ebony \u2019 s journey to environmental activism began in a very personal way , when her son developed asthma due to environmental injustice in her community .\nShe later learned that her experience was not unique , but is part of a bigger problem in which Black and Brown communities are the ones most impacted by environmental injustice .\nWhat We Need to Know Now : Fumes Across the Fence-Line : The Health Impacts of Air Pollution from Oil & Gas Facilities on African American Communities Shocked by the degree to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diversity of frontline communities , Ebony devoted herself to increasing Black and Brown representation in the traditionally white-male-dominated field .\nShe seized the opportunity to join Greenpeace US in a talent acquisition role and set about the task of creating opportunities for other folks like her to \u201c not just be engaged in the discussion , but be engaged in the strategies and solutions.\n\u201d The rest as she modestly says is \u201c history \u201d \u2013 belying the transformational impact of her work on the organization .\nEbony also emphasized that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally important to acknowledge and address the unique challenges they face once they get to \u201c the table.\n\u201d This conversation is especially pertinent as we recently watched another phenomenal trailblazer make history .\nIn this month celebrating women , the confirmation hearings of the first Black Woman to be nominated to the U.S Supreme Court , Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson began on the International Day for the End of All Racial Discrimination .\nIt was a rare opportunity to witness history in the making and , for many , the feelings it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Black Women who have earned their place at the top of white-male-dominated institutions , the eminently qualified Judge Jackson faced questions about whether she belonged .\nShe shared the doubts that crept across her mind as a young student when she first walked the halls of Harvard , and the strength she found in the single word shared by another Black Woman who knew upon sight of her inner turmoil \u2013 \u201c persevere.\n\u201d The confirmation hearing was undeniably a moment deserving of unabashed celebration .\nBut as we know , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the norms of professionalism , decorum , white supremacy culture discourage Black joy , it can seem easier to fight for the next victory than to celebrate what we have already accomplished .\nMoments of triumph for prominent Black folks are often further complicated by the heightened scrutiny that comes with them , challenging us to be our authentic selves , often while holding ourselves to a higher standard of performance .\nEbony reveals that despite her success and demonstrated leadership , she too experiences those doubts .\nHer words of advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards our purpose is to trust ourselves .\nShe urges us to be authentic , brave , and bold because we add value when we bring our full selves to the table .\n\u201c Trust yourself , \u201d she says \u201c even when it seems you shouldn \u2019 t .\nThat \u2019 s probably the time when you should the most.\n\u201d ISH : Hey Family , I hope you \u2019 re doing good .\nMy name is Ish , I use he and him pronouns and I am excited to welcome you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Need Now .\nAVERY : Hey y \u2019 all I \u2019 m Avery .\nI use she/her pronouns and today we \u2019 re gon na talk a bit about the importance and the impact of having Black people in leadership and what that means for movement focused organizations .\nISH : This episode is a minisode\u2026 [ minisode sound effect

to introduce the very first Black Woman Executive Director of a national legacy environmental organization in the US .\nShe is none other than the Co-Executive Director of Greenpeace , Ebony Martin .\nHey Ebony , welcome to the show !\nEBONY : Hey !\nOh my goodness , it \u2019 s so great to be with you both today , this is like Black excellence .\nI \u2019 m loving it .\nISH : Yes yes , Black excellence .\nOh yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here too .\nThis is an exciting moment to have you , the Co-executive director , join the call .\nSo really excited to chat with you .\nEBONY : I am I \u2019 m I \u2019 m so I \u2019 m so excited to be here .\nThis is just like , my journey in Greenpeace to like , see this\u2026It \u2019 s just like my wildest dreams come true .\nISH : Oh that \u2019 s facts .\nIt \u2019 s like being able to be on this call and like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like .\nI \u2019 m talking with Ebony Martin Co-Executive director of Greenpeace .\nI \u2019 m talking to Avery up in here .\nLike we are actually really really thriving right now .\nReally good to hear these Black voices , see these Black faces and just really get into it .\nSo Ebony , how \u2019 s your week been so far ?\nHow you doing ?\nEBONY : You know it \u2019 s it \u2019 s been a great week .\nWe are getting ready to announce our first Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later today so you know we \u2019 re just doing big things around here .\nSo it is .\nIt \u2019 s a good day .\nA good week .\nLike Ice Cube say , I got ta say it was a good day .\nAVERY : The Black Excellence just does not stop at Greenpeace lately !\nEBONY : Girl .\nJust get ready .\nWe got some more for you .\nISH : I like this .\nI like this !\nRight So we would love to hear more about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to work in the environmental movement and what was your journey like to get to where you are now .\nLike who are you ?\nEBONY : Wow that \u2019 s deep .\nWho am I ?\nI \u2019 m probably many things to many people .\nI \u2019 m a mom .\nI \u2019 m a wife , I \u2019 m a sister .\nI \u2019 m a auntie .\nI \u2019 m a daughter .\nI \u2019 m a worship leader .\nYou and I know I \u2019 m a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m a dog lover and I \u2019 m an environmental activist .\nSo , how I got to Greenpeace was actually my oldest son started developing breathing issues and I was trying to figure out like what was going on .\nAnd so I take him to the doctor and she , you know , said it \u2019 s probably asthma and I said to her well , I don \u2019 t have asthmatics in my family like that .\nDoesn \u2019 t run in my family and I thought asthma was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where do you live ?\nWhat \u2019 s your neighborhood like ?\nAre there gr-Is there grass ?\nAre there trees around ?\nAnd I was like , well , you know , I live kind of on the highway .\nAnd she said it \u2019 s probably the pollution from the cars , the truck exhaust , that was probably impacting his breathing .\nSo that was startling for me , so I started to do more research and found out that Black children are more disproportionately impacted by asthma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 % more likely to get it and three times more likely to die .\nAnd I was like , EBONY : It is .\nAnd I had no idea , like , when I started to look into it more that even the way highways and roadways are constructed have like a racial undertone to them .\nThey put , you know highways and byways , in cities that are more Black and Brown .\nIn doing more research , of course , when you look into the environmental movement , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like mine .\nOr look like us .\nBut we \u2019 re the ones that are most impacted .\nAnd so , like I kind of purposed in my heart from that moment forward , like .\nI had to do something to make a difference or do something to make a change and to make sure that more people like us were represented .\nIn the environmental justice fight .\nAnd to bring more faces in like ours .\nAnd a position popped up open for me at Greenpeace in Talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , I prayed about it and I was like .\n\u201c Well , maybe this is my opportunity that I can make change \u201d I applied to Greenpeace and the rest is history and I \u2019 ve I \u2019 ve been here I \u2019 m ever since creating space for others folks like us to not just be engaged in the discussion but be engaged in the strategies and the solutions .\nAVERY : Thank you so much for sharing that with us .\nThat \u2019 s that \u2019 s truly horrifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is doing better now .\nYou know , the NAACP released a really amazing report around the respiratory impacts on people of color called \u201c Fumes Across the Fence Line.\n\u201d The health impacts of air pollution from oil and gas facilities on African American communities , and I highly recommend that everybody go check that report out because it \u2019 s very illuminating into the issues that we face with pollution and emissions being concentrated around our communities .\nISH : Wow , thanks for thanks for sharing that and Avery .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely check that out for sure .\nYeah , we \u2019 re glad to have you not even gon na lie .\nI \u2019 m glad that the journey did take you here , \u2019 cause there \u2019 s been a lot of changes so far .\nEBONY : Yeah , and I \u2019 m so grateful like that Even now we can connect with the NAACP and other allied groups of color to amplify .\nAnd to like I said at the end of the day , it \u2019 s about creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know what we need to do .\nAnd right now it \u2019 s just on a pathway of , and trajectory towards us building power to do exactly what we need to do .\nAVERY : You can say that again .\nSo let \u2019 s have a little Minnie Riperton moment and just go \u201c Back Down Memory Lane.\n\u201d When you found out that you were becoming the Co-Executive director of Greenpeace .\nWhat was that moment like for you ?\nWhat were you feeling ?\nEBONY : Wow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annie told me that the\u2013 who \u2019 s who \u2019 s a Co executive director with me , had told me that the board chairs wanted to meet with me about a leadership discussion for the organization and I kind of freaked out .\nI was like , \u201c the board chairs ?\nWhat do you mean they want to meet ?\n\u201d And she was like \u201c No , it \u2019 s a good thing , you know , just just come to the meeting.\n\u201d So I \u2019 m like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a really good relationship with Jakada Imani who \u2019 s our Inc Board chair , first Black Inc. Board chair also .\nShout out to Jakada .\nEBONY : Yes , so I get in the meeting with them and they start discussing , you know , the trajectory of the organization and how we are pioneers in multiracial leadership and just the changes that we \u2019 ve made within the organization with regards to embedding justice .\nAnd they said , you know , and we think it \u2019 s time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , you know , we want Greenpeace to have the most impact at this moment and we think now is like a pivotal moment with nearly 60 % of Americans concerned about the climate crisis .\nThis just wasn \u2019 t the case .\nLike five years ago .\nNow it \u2019 s like literally THE topic of discussion .\nAnd then they were , like you know , we \u2019 ve seen your partnership with Annie .\nWe \u2019 ve seen your leadership in the organization and we want to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization .\nAnd when he said it to me , I kind of was like it did not hit me .\nSo I actually picked up the phone and text my husband and I \u2019 m like , \u201c I think they just offered me Co-executive director.\n\u201d He calls me and he \u2019 s like , \u201c What ?\n!\n\u201d but I had to put him on mute .\nI was like , \u201c I can \u2019 t talk .\nI \u2019 m on the phone with them like I \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just didn \u2019 t hit me .\nLike it it it was .\nIt was like they were still talking to me , but I just wasn \u2019 t like in the moment .\nAnd I told them , you know , \u201c OK , thank you so much .\nI \u2019 m really honored .\nLet me pray about it.\n\u201d \u2019 cause I don \u2019 t take anything without praying .\nAnd I got off the phone with them and I \u2019 ll\u2013 I kid you not .\nIt still didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayb .\n30 days later they were like , \u201c We made you an offer , are you going to circle back with us ?\n\u201d And over that time , over those 30 days , like when I began to pray and really consider like what was happening and what I felt I was being positioned for in the moment and the impact that I felt that I could make .\nThat is when it all began to hit me .\nAnd .\nAt the end of the day , like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just my child , but for other children because clean air and water is a basic human right .\nSo how could I in this lifetime being given this opportunity , not take advantage of the platform that was laid before me to make impact and change in the world ?\nSo it , in short , it didn \u2019 t really hit me until like days and weeks later , and to be honest it..it \u2019 s still hitting me like even in moments like now where I see the gravity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ebony , I just want to ask you a quick follow up .\nYou know you detailed a little bit about your journey and to come into Greenpeace .\nWhen you first joined Greenpeace , did you envision yourself eventually taking on such an impactful leadership role ?\nWas this something that you saw in your future ?\nI know you said you were a little blindsided by the offer , which is , which is an amazing thing to have happen\u2013happen , you know ?\nWe love these happy little surprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you envisioned for yourself when you began your journey at Greenpeace ?\nEBONY : Avery , never in a million years , never in a million years .\nMy goal was to come into the organization and honestly , it was to be HR director .\nI wanted to move up in talent acquisition , which I was able to do .\nAlso , nurture talent up under me and move into HR because as the HR director role , that \u2019 s where a lot of the policies and the strategies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens .\nAnd that was actually my goal .\nAnd I had a goal to do that I think in\u2026.I can \u2019 t remember probably like three to five years and that actually happened for me in two years .\nYou know , once I- I got into that role and was able to build a team around me , we were able to make it like a lot of impact on the organization with regards to ensuring our policies were more equitable and lead to more equitable outcomes with regards to compensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that nature .\nAnd then something happened and I think the Chief Operating Officer left .\nAnd Annie came to me and said , she said , I want you to just take the realm of the administrative team for six months .\nAnd six months turned into a couple of years , and then the next thing I know I \u2019 m getting asked to do Co-executive director of Greenpeace .\nSo it it \u2019 s been a wild and amazing ride and it has far outlived whatever expectation I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We love to see it .\nIt sounds to me like Annie Leonard and the board knew a good thing when they saw it .\nSo again , we \u2019 re super glad that you \u2019 re here .\nSo what do you think the impact is that this will have moving forward in terms of other green groups and environmental and climate justice , focus movement groups ?\nEBONY : Yeah , I \u2019 m really hopeful that it sends like a huge message to the movement .\nI think oftentimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we \u2019 re looking for Leadership roles or when we \u2019 re looking for certain things that are lacking or that we perceive to be lacking in organization , when really they \u2019 re right up under your nose .\nThey \u2019 re right there all along , and one thing I have always tried to do in Greenpeace is like to cultivate leadership , to seek out talent and then to invest in them that I see potential .\nAnd I think , you know , me moving up in the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t perceived to be you know , you know if you think about a Co-Executive director of Greenpeace , the first thing I would have thought was , \u201c oh it would come from the programs department.\n\u201d I \u2019 m such an anomaly in that way , so I \u2019 m hopeful that it \u2019 ll signal to the movement that what you have , probably right around you , is what you need to get you to the next level , and I \u2019 m hopeful that other big legacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enviro but like the movement at large starts to pay attention to the talent that they have right in front of them .\nISH : Speaking of those , national legacy and enviro orgs and just organizations in general like we \u2019 re rounding out Black History Month like we \u2019 re going right in the Women \u2019 s History Month , and I \u2019 m just really excited that we have the first Black Woman Executive director of one of those type of organizations like like , what does that mean ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities for Greenpeace as an organization to move towards being even more intentional about advancing equity , embedding justice .\nBut I also assume there \u2019 s Probably a lot more challenges as well , and I \u2019 m curious if you could speak a little bit to like what those challenges could be .\nEBONY : Uhm yeah , what can those challenges be ?\nIsh , I \u2019 m sure you have a list of them .\nAvery , I \u2019 m sure you have a list of them .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re confronted with those challenges everyday .\nAren \u2019 t we ?\nJust existing as Black bodies in inherently white- dominated spaces ?\nWe we face those challenges every day .\nI think society-wise , we \u2019 re facing like a reckoning right now .\nAnd like we \u2019 re calling on institutions basically to move beyond their flashy phrases and kind of their performative tactics and really move into transformation .\nAnd , transformation with regards to justice , that actually is the change that liberates , and that \u2019 s actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progress and the big ambitious goals like that we have .\nWe have big goals in this movement and the only way to get to them really is transformation , because we can \u2019 t keep doing the same thing .\nAnd so I think the challenge is\u2026is for folks to like embrace the transformation in the change and the strategies that they need to adopt to make the change .\nIt \u2019 s not good enough just to have Black and Brown folks at the table .\nOr like I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to have Black and Brown folks in the car with you .\nIt \u2019 s time for them .\nYou know to hand over the keys .\nIn some regards , it \u2019 s time for them to , you know , change the lanes .\nSometimes this our lane and we have the solutions and you know we need to let folks drive .\nAnd I , I think at the end of the day it \u2019 s really about ceding power in certain spaces and I know that \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that \u2019 s the only way change is going to come because right now what we \u2019 ve been doing hasn \u2019 t been working .\nIt hasn \u2019 t .\nISH : So we \u2019 re gon na take a little break and then we \u2019 re gon na talk about Centering Blackness and what that means to us , but first , a quick ad break .\nHey y \u2019 all this is Rico from the What We Need Now team .\nHave you noticed that we don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not real ones anyway .\nJust fake ads for fake companies like Sellyourowndata.com and Diet M.L.K .\nWe \u2019 re able to do that because Greenpeace USA \u2019 s work toward a greener , more peaceful and more just future is supported by folks like you .\nSo if you enjoy the podcast , please consider becoming a monthly sustainer of Greenpeace USA .\nYou can do so by visiting \u201c greenpeace.org/usa/whatweneednow \u201d it \u2019 s that easy .\nAVERY : Well hey , hi and hello everybody .\nWelcome back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third season of What We Need Now is around centering Blackness .\nYou know , speaking from personal experience , I \u2019 ve spent my entire professional career at various environmental nonprofits and movement organizations , and I can tell you , it \u2019 s not always easy to really show up in your unapologetic Blackness in these spaces that are typically dominated by white folks , you know ?\nSo Ebony , I \u2019 m wondering if you can tell us a little bit more about what centering Blackness means to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially in your role as Co-executive director of Greenpeace USA .\nEBONY : Yeah , Avery thanks for sharing that .\nIt really resonates with me .\nIt \u2019 s hard sometimes to show up unapologetically who you are , especially when , society has taught us that Black is not beautiful or that Black is problematic or Black is , you know something detrimental .\nNobody wants a , you know , a Black mark .\nIt \u2019 s always given like a bad name .\nBut , I \u2019 ve been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there \u2019 s a phrase that she had where she says , \u201c The moment we choose to love we begin to move against domination and oppression .\nThe moment we choose to love , we begin to move towards freedom and act in ways that liberate ourselves and others.\n\u201d And so for me , centering Blackness is basically centering that love .\nLove of our self , total acceptance of who we are with all of our quirks .\nWith all of the good things that come with us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are struggling like within ourselves to even rise to a higher level of real realization or manifestation .\nBut it \u2019 s like loving , loving yourself , loving what you \u2019 re going through .\nLoving who you \u2019 re developing into becoming .\nAnd I think for us and in regards to like centering Blackness , It \u2019 s about total love and acceptance of who we are as people .\nWhat we bring when we bring all of ourselves , no matter what it is .\nAnd so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolving into the organization .\nWhere we are censoring who we are as people and who we are as a community .\nLike I said , yeah at the end of the day , it \u2019 s centering its centering that love and that for me , is like centering Blackness .\nISH : Yeah yeah yeah , I love that historically , like we know what \u2019 s been going on with the relationship between Black people in the US .\nLike often the needs of Black people and the issues we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to mention the many many different areas where we \u2019 ve had a lot of racial tensions specifically , like police with the justice systems and kind of how they just treated us in general .\nSo I \u2019 m just\u2013we \u2019 re just curious to ask .\nLiterally\u2026.what steps do you think the US should be taking in order to kind of make sure that our lives , our people become more of a priority ?\nISH : I know we could spend like 50 more hours on that\u2026 EBONY : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean that question really resonates with me because the article that just came out in New York Times about the Biden administration and J 40 and what strategies\u2026what environmental strategies they \u2019 re developing to help or to correct actually , the environmental injustices that have been placed upon , largely BIPOC folks .\nAnd what they \u2019 re doing is actually trying to create the strategies around like a\u2013 a race neutral approach like not even acknowledge race in it .\nAnd this is like , really perplexing because like Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of industrial pollution is race .\nIt doesn \u2019 t have to do with your property value .\nIt doesn \u2019 t have to do with your income level , but it \u2019 s race .\nLike I said , they literally place BIPOC communities in harm \u2019 s way when it comes to the environment .\nEBONY : It \u2019 s crazy .\nSo I don \u2019 t .\nI don \u2019 t know how we \u2019 re going to come up with solutions when we don \u2019 t acknowledge that race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the problem .\nAnd so , I think the first thing is like we have to stop erasing blackness and brownness .\nWe have to stop erasing like\u2013 it \u2019 s there and it is the root cause of the issues and the crisis that we are facing today .\nAnd that takes courage and you have to know that they \u2019 re still going to be pushed back .\nAnd I think somebody said , you know , you \u2019 re gon na get sued either way , so you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and know that it \u2019 s linked back to the disproportionate harm placed on BIPOC communities .\nAnd so I think the first thing is like to kind of like yell at this administration .\nYou can \u2019 t erase that .\nIt \u2019 s core to the fight .\nIt \u2019 s core to the movement .\nAVERY : I completely agree .\nYeah , it \u2019 s absolutely paramount that we continue to call out that so much of environmental racism .\nWhat we call fossil fuel racism is intentional .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that same level of coordination IN our strategies in order to be able to combat it , you know .\nEBONY : Yeah , it \u2019 s like we \u2019 re taking two steps forward and then taking three steps back .\nKeep pushing it and I think , again , we have to be at the table .\nNot just there for visibility , but there for our strategies and there for our answers , and there to demand what it is we need because nobody else can tell us what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t like cede space in that way .\n\u201c Oh , I \u2019 ma just let them fight for us , \u201d No .\nIt \u2019 s time out for that .\nAVERY : Yeah absolutely .\nOur community is our people .\nWe know the solutions that we need .\nWe have all the answers among us .\nAbsolutely paramount that we \u2019 re there .\nAnd me Personally , I \u2019 m very excited that you \u2019 re at the table .\nI \u2019 m very excited that you \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you \u2019 re ushering Greenpeace into a new era .\nYou know , for Black people in the movement , or even more specifically , for Black women like myself , who may have aspirations to also make history , inspire change , help shape the legacy of the climate , justice movement of this era , what advice would you give to us ?\nEBONY : You know , I think Avery as Black women we are in a unique role because it \u2019 s\u2026 sometimes when you experience resistance or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out is it because I \u2019 m Black or is it because I \u2019 m a woman ?\nAnd so it \u2019 s like that .\nThat paradox that we \u2019 re often dealing with , but I think .\nThe advice that I would offer to Black women in particular , and Black folks in particular who are\u2026who know that they \u2019 ve been called to make an impact and to make a change is to number one : trust yourself .\nTrust yourself , trust yourself , trust yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ideas that I know went against the status quo or I thought about things in ways that were different from the environment or the culture around me and sometimes I wouldn \u2019 t speak up .\nBut I knew I had a thought or idea or suggestion that could make change .\nAnd in those moments when I actually started to trust myself and put myself out there because I know that that makes you vulnerable because a lot of times folks will look at you like you crazy .\nYou\u2026.you put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started to trust myself .\nThat \u2019 s when the change started to happen .\nThat \u2019 s when systems started to shift , or barriers began to fall and it \u2019 s hard to do that like I said , because you can say things and people\u2013 you \u2019 ll be met with silence or you \u2019 ll be met with\u2026you know folks just kind of looking sideways at you and not really agreeing with you , but you \u2019 ll be surprised .\nMaybe two days later , you \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that you said resonated with them , or you \u2019 ll get a\u2013 a tap on his shoulder and someone will say \u201c that sounds like a good idea .\nHow can we make this work ?\n\u201d So my my number one advice would be to trust yourself even when it seems you shouldn \u2019 t .\nThat \u2019 s probably time when you should the most .\nAVERY : Thank you for that .\nI think as Black people sometimes we forget the importance of our intuition and you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment and what \u2019 s deemed to be acceptable for how we \u2019 re supposed to navigate the workplace , sort of overshadow that intuition .\nI think it \u2019 s very important that we don \u2019 t lose sight of that .\nSo thank you for offering that up , Ebony .\nEBONY : Yeah , definitely .\nI think that that \u2019 s something even to this day I continue to struggle with .\nBut I have to remind myself often .\nI \u2019 m different .\nAnd diversity and differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes the work better and stronger so\u2026 Bring that difference and trust in your difference .\nTrust who you are .\nISH : Well , I love that .\nThat \u2019 s like I \u2019 m ready to go ahead and buy me a hashtag .\nTrust Black folks , hashtag trust Black women .\nThank you for sharing that .\nAnd I hope the listeners definitely hear that too .\nLike trust yourself like that is something that is very powerful to see you as a Black woman .\nMake it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt has been nothing short of incredible , so we \u2019 re excited to have you talk through that .\nBut before we close out this episode , we have one question that we ask all of our guests .\nSo as Black people , what do you think we need now ?\nEBONY : What do we need now ?\nHoney , we have everything .\nWe are the most creative , funniest , solutions-oriented\u2026 .\nWe are so productive .\nLike just the way we come up with things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way we experience things , like our culture is just so amazing .\nSo what do we need now ?\nJust to continue to be who we are , continue to show up how we are in the moment .\nBe us .\nBe you .\nCelebrate one another .\nBlack Joy .\nBlack excellence .\nLike be happy for you , that \u2019 s what we need .\nJust like\u2026We are amazing people .\nThe things that we accomplish whenever we put our minds to things , no matter what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Olympic skater , what she had just gotten on the ice for the first time in six years .\nAnd then she gon na go win a medal ?\nLike we just be doing things and doing things big .\nSo like , just let \u2019 s just keep going .\nISH : Love that come on , it \u2019 s almost like you know that we \u2019 re centering Blackness .\nSo thank you for that .\nEbony , any final words that you want to say to the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so excited .\nReally grateful to talk to the audience .\nReach out to me anytime .\nLike you know , I tell staff that I am very accessible .\nJust yeah , just thank you .\nThank you Avery .\nThank you Ish .\nThank you to the what we need now crew .\nLet \u2019 s keep going .\nISH : We want to thank Ebony again for joining us on this episode of What We Need Now .\nIt was truly a pleasure to have her join us for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ links to her bio and work in our blog and social media posts .\nWe want to continue to remind everyone that it \u2019 s going to take all of us fighting together to get there .\nNo matter your age , gender , ethnicity , or anything we are all needed in the fight for Black lives .\nSo that \u2019 s all

Two Judges", "content": "Two women , whose legal experience could not be more different , are expected to wrap up their proceedings for prestigious judge positions this week .\nJudge Ketanji Brown Jackson is awaiting confirmation as Supreme Court Justice after rigorous hearings , and Jennifer Rearden is expected to face the Committee on the Judiciary as the judicial nominee for the Southern District of New York , a court that reviews cases involving white-collar and corporate crime , among other key issues .\nEven though Jackson and Rearden are not vying for the same position it \u2019 s crucial to note the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our country \u2019 s future .\nBoth Jackson and Rearden are being considered for different lifetime judge positions appointments at a time where our planet is in peril .\nBecause environmental laws are only as strong as the judges who uphold them , it is now more urgent than ever to choose judges who have people and the planet \u2019 s best interest at heart .\nWhile Jackson \u2019 s stellar record outshines her future colleagues , it \u2019 s worth comparing the two .\nPrivate-sector lawyers , like Jennifer Rearden , choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge hourly fees ( and perhaps choose the ones that will line their pockets ) .\nPublic defenders , like Judge Jackson was during her career , don \u2019 t choose their clients .\nInstead , they ensure proper legal defense for many vulnerable populations who would not have representation otherwise .\nPlus , Rearden \u2019 s chosen clientele is not looking so good .\nA letter signed by 32 public interest groups to the Senate Judiciary Committee about Rearden \u2019 s record describes defending housing discrimination , seeking to overturn worker protections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for wheelchairs , making her \u201c unsuitable for this appointment.\n\u201d She helped Uber and other ride-hailing companies weaken rules meant to help disabled people , fought a discrimination case by a disabled AIDS patient against the LeFrak Organization , and worked on a case that allowed city charter schools to pay workers below the prevailing wage .\nAnother similar letter , signed by Greenpeace USA and others , says \u201c Rearden has worked against the interests of historically oppressed members of our communities , exacerbating social inequalities.\n\u201d And while Jackson was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a public defender , providing legal support to individuals who might not have representation otherwise , it is in no way comparable to the decision by highly-compensated private sector lawyers who represent one of the world \u2019 s largest oil companies ( and other companies that repeatedly violate environmental laws and regulations ) .\nThe Future of our Planet When big corporations release toxic pollution into the air we breathe and water we drink , people can use courts to fight back and hold them to account .\nBut , Jennifer Reardon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jennifer Rearden and her firm , Gibson Dunn & Crutcher , have made it their business to represent corporations against efforts to hold them accountable for lying about climate science and blocking solutions to the climate crisis , preventing measures to address systemic racism , opposing vital protections for workers , and violating human rights at home and abroad .\nWe need fair and equity minded judges , like Judge Jackson , who understand the difference between science and politics and recognize the government \u2019 s responsibility to protect people , our health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Ketanji Brown Jackson , can help bring justice to Black and Brown communities who have suffered disproportionately from pollution and dangerous contamination of water and air .\nFor generations , Black women have been locked out of the opportunity to serve on the Supreme Court .\nWith the nomination of Hon .\nKetanji Brown Jackson , we are taking a step towards making our justice system one that respects and reflects the very best of every kind of American .\nThe Supreme Court determines whether the government can take action on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from combating the climate crisis to upholding our right to clean air and water , and protecting our right to vote .\nIt is urgent for Judge Jackson to be confirmed without delay , because this year , the Court is expected to decide on several important environmental cases .\nSign the petition to the U.S. Senate : Confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court without delay What can you do about Rearden ?\nMany big firm lawyers and many prosecutors get appointed to our courts .\nJudge Jackson is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Supreme Court and that is long overdue .\nAdditionally , Judge Jackson \u2019 s decade on the federal bench demonstrates that she is a judge who serves the people , not polluters .\nWe don \u2019 t need another Trump nominee as one of our next federal judges .\nJennifer Rearden should not be chosen as a judge on one of the nations \u2019 highest courts .\nWrite your

and must be put into action right now .\nAnd here \u2019 s where you and I come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this report is not shelved .\nIt needs to be talked about in every corner of the world , and most importantly : acted on .\nThe starting point you already know : the climate action our governments and the financial sector have taken by now keeps being too little too late , and we need much , much more , and fast .\nNot a single country is yet doing enough .\nAnd it \u2019 s a critical decade when we make or break this .\nSo then , what is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our 6 takeaways from the IPCC report on mitigation that we think you should know : 1 .\nWe have the solutions we need to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C !\nThis is the best news : we have the solutions to slash more than half of the global emissions in just eight years , and to continue from there towards net-zero emissions , as is needed to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C .\nIn this critical decade by 2030 , the biggest contributions to net emission reductions would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservation and restoration of forests and other natural ecosystems , climate-friendly agriculture and food , and energy efficiency .\nMore than half the potential by 2030 comes with low costs ( below 20 USD/tonne ) or even negative costs !\nCosts below zero mean that investing in solutions , like solar and wind , will bring cost savings compared to continuing current ways .\n2 .\nWe can get much more with less .\nBy 2050 , huge potential exists , overall , in demand-side strategies that could cut emissions by 40-70 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designing and repurposing infrastructure , advancing technology adoption , and enhancing socio-cultural factors that enable and reward sustainable ways of life from walkable and bikeable cities and shared and electrified mobility to self-sustaining homes , healthy plant-based diets , avoided flights , and to consumption requiring less material input as we reuse , repair and improve recycling .\nRather than leaving it to individuals and their choices , we need systems approaches that advance climate-friendly choices for all , while prioritizing the rights and needs of those who are yet to reap the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the population worldwide lack decent homes , mobility , and food and will need additional energy , capacity , and resources for human wellbeing .\n3 .\nMoney needs to be urgently redirected from problems to solutions .\nTo achieve the needed emission cuts , annual investment flows towards clean energy , efficiency , transport , agriculture , and forests will need to increase at least 3-6 fold up to 2030 .\nThere is sufficient global capital and liquidity to close these investment gaps , but it \u2019 s not heading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more private and public money still flows to fossil fuels than to climate solutions , due to misaligned incentives both outside and within the financial sector .\nRemoving fossil fuel subsidies could , alone , reduce emissions by up to 10 % by 2030 .\nAccess to finance remains a big barrier , especially for developing countries , and the promised levels of climate finance ( 100 billion USD/year ) from developed countries have not been met .\n4 .\nCurrent national targets and policies are a recipe for failure and must fundamentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their climate plans , not a single country is yet

that Facebook , Pinterest , TikTok , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tackle the climate disinformation problem on their sites .\nFirst , it might be helpful to explain what climate disinformation is and how it

from \u201c misinformation \u201d , which is wrong or incorrect information that is spread by mistake , oversight , or naivet\u00e9 .\nSometimes , the \u201c climate disinformation \u201d \u2014 which

crisis and its severity or about the technology and solutions we have to combat it .\nThe fossil fuel industry has been using disinformation as a tool for decades to delay climate action by sowing public distrust in climate science and in the solutions to confront the crisis .\nIn October 2021 , the House Oversight Committee held a hearing calling on the CEOs of some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer for their role in spreading disinformation about the role fossil fuels play in causing global warming .\nIn February of this year , a new study confirmed yet again that the industry commonly

advertising .\nOnly Pinterest publicly articulates an expert-informed definition that applies to both paid and organic content .\nWe also found a gross lack of transparency from all five platforms

organizations were and still are predominantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us decades ago , our staff , our supporters , our leaders and our boards have too long lacked the racial diversity of our country\u2013and our thinking , our relevance and our power suffer for it .\nThat bias presents itself in how both problems and solutions are defined , and can be seen in how , over the past four decades , the movement around environmental justice has grown up alongside the environmental conservation movement .\nThe mainstream environmental movement has been focused on natural resources conservation and pollution , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the communities of color who are all too often affected by pollution .\nFor many years , that was the way my organization , Greenpeace USA , prioritized its work

like coal-fired power plants , researchers found that Black communities faced 1.5 times more air pollution than the rest of the country .\nSo here we are , 40 years later , and the environmental

fuels , and the stalling of our government ?\nRenewable energy is the answer !\nWay , way back in the summer of 2008 , Barack Obama was battling John McCain for the Presidency \u2013 and gas prices were soaring .\nMcCain \u2019 s running mate , Alaska Governor Sarah Palin , had a plan to bring down prices \u2013 \u201c Drill Baby Drill.\n\u201d The idea was that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas drilling and that would both lower prices and make us less dependent on \u201c foreign oil.\n\u201d John McCain lost that election , but the weird thing is that we basically went with the \u201c Palin Plan \u201d anyway .\nSince 2008 , oil and gas production in the U.S. has boomed thanks to new technology such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing ( fracking ) .\nWe are now producing over twice as much crude oil and about 70 % more natural gas than in 2008 , and in 2019 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of politicians \u2013 \u201c energy independence.\n\u201d But if that \u2019 s true then why are gasoline prices sky high yet again ?\nWhat happened , Sarah ?\nIt \u2019 s a complex question , but part of the answer has to do with exports .\nEnergy Independence Is For Rich Corporations\u2026 Not Ordinary People The first thing to know is that living in an area that produces a lot of oil and gas does not mean that we get a discount on high prices at the pump .\nCrude oil is traded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is set by the global market .\nSo when Russia invaded Ukraine and many countries responded by refusing to import Russian oil , that sent a price shock through the oil market , directly leading to $ 6 per gallon gasoline here in the U.S. Crucially , our \u201c energy independence \u201d did nothing to shield ordinary folks from this shock .\nCrude prices went up here , same as everywhere , because crude markets are linked .\nIf a local U.S. driller can get a higher price by exporting their oil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to take it .\nIn a corporate-dominated market system , the oil always flows where it will generate the biggest profits .\nCurrently oil companies are enjoying high profits and they are not able or willing to rapidly increase production .\nEven if they did boost production , that added U.S. oil would only be a \u201c proverbial drop in the bucket in the 100-million-barrel-per-day global oil market.\n\u201d Politicians like to pretend that more drilling will lower gasoline prices , but that \u2019 s just not how it works .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crude oil exports , but Congress and President Obama lifted that ban in 2015 .\nSince then , access to international markets has been one of the driving factors in the recent U.S. production boom and we now export around 3 million barrels of crude oil per day .\nAt the same time , export shipments of liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) went from almost nothing in 2016 to over 3,500 billion cubic feet in 2021 .\nIn particular , these new export markets have super-charged drilling in the Permian Basin in

that fossil fuels are among the most expensive and volatile sources of energy we have .\nOur reliance on fossil fuels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fueling wars , driving the climate crisis and spewing health-damaging air pollution .\nWhat \u2019 s worse , price spikes from the periodic \u201c boom and bust \u201d cycles of the oil industry are difficult to predict and even harder to protect yourself against .\nThe best thing we can do is to get off fossil fuels as fast as possible .\nExploiting the War to Lock In More Fossil Fuels The 1992 Rio Earth Summit will mark its 30th anniversary

quickly to take full advantage of the chaos .\nThanks to the Ukraine war , the energy crunch is most acute in Europe , which is heavily reliant on Russian fossil fuels .\nTo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry has proposed a slew of new projects to import more natural gas from the U.S. , Qatar , North Africa , and elsewhere .\nBut this gas stampede is a mistake .\nStudies have shown the European Union already

terminals have been proposed .\nBut the problem is the same on the export side : new export capacity is not needed to meet Europe \u2019 s short-term demand , and projects that will take 3-5 years to come online could face a world with a shrinking market for LNG .\nIf new crude and LNG export terminals are given permits , it will increase the pollution and public health burden on the Gulf Coast in

seafood they sell is legally caught and with no human rights or labor violations .\nRetailers and manufactures know this .\nSo the labels promising environmental sustainability are meant to reassure us that all is well .\nThe question then becomes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the answer is not a simple yes or no .\nGlobal seafood supply chains , particularly tuna supply chains , are notoriously complex and opaque .\nFish could be caught anywhere in the oceans .\nThen they are hauled by fishers from developing nations on ships owned by companies from middle-income nations , processed in a wholly

it \u2019 s because it absolutely is .\nThis is not what real transparency looks like .\nInstead of leaving it up to already overwhelmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuna brands should simply disclose a list of all

propaganda meant to deceive you and delay climate action .\nA cat meme .\nThis is what scrolling through your feed on social media sites might look like today \u2014 and that \u2019 s because Big Tech

their platforms .\nOn top of that , companies like Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engagement numbers that the spread of dis- and misinformation brought to the platforms for years .\nAfter all , keeping the numbers high attracted investors and advertisers .\nIt was only when the public outcry and federal hearings started to threaten the loss of advertisers , investors , and employees that they began to roll out policies to deal with disinformation .\nBut , are these policies doing enough ?\nA new scorecard by Friends of the Earth , Avaaz , and Greenpeace USA shows that Facebook , Pinterest ,

.\nPut simply , \u201c disinformation \u201d is done with the intention to spread false or misleading information to deceive or and to potentially benefit .\nThis differs from \u201c misinformation \u201d , which is wrong or incorrect information that is spread by mistake , oversight , or naivet\u00e9 .\nSometimes , the \u201c climate disinformation \u201d \u2014 which has been called out by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest report as a major threat to meeting our climate goals \u2014 is purposefully spreading wrong , deceitful , or misleading information about the climate crisis and its severity or about the technology and solutions we have to combat it .\nThe fossil fuel industry has been using disinformation as a tool for decades to delay climate action by sowing public distrust in climate science and in the solutions to confront the crisis .\nIn October 2021 , the House Oversight Committee held a hearing calling on the CEOs of some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer for their role in spreading disinformation about the role fossil fuels play in causing global warming .\nIn February of this year , a new study confirmed yet again that the industry commonly uses greenwashing to mislead the public on what they say they are doing vs. what they are actually doing .\nWe wanted to see what social media platforms were actually doing to prevent the spread of climate disinformation .\nThe report measured companies \u2019 definitions , policies , and processes using a 27-point assessment put together by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score , the more advanced the company was in identifying and disclosing how it hopes to prevent the spread of climate disinformation on its platforms .\nOnly Pinterest and YouTube scored over 50 % , both scoring 14 out of 27 .\nFacebook , TikTok , and Twitter received 9 , 7 , and 5 points respectively .\nFor Facebook , TikTok , and Twitter , the failure starts with a poor foundation from which it builds these policies .\nThese three companies have not adopted a climate expert-informed definition of climate dis/misinformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its expert-informed definition only applies to paid content \u2013 AKA to advertising .\nOnly Pinterest publicly articulates an expert-informed definition that applies to both paid and organic content .\nWe also found a gross lack of transparency from all five platforms .\nNone of the platforms release regular reports that detail the scale and prevalence of climate dis/misinformation , or on mitigation efforts taken internally .\nThis means there is simply no way to tell if their policies are addressing the problem , if they \u2019 re consistently enforced , and if bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere are some rather simple actions that these companies could take to significantly curb and eventually stop their platforming of disinformation : adopt the most effective policies , follow-through on enforcement , and be transparent about what \u2019 s happening .\nIt \u2019 s time for social media companies to stop aiding the planetary collapse that climate disinformation is pushing us towards .\nDisinformation is so dangerous because it creates an erosion of trust in our communities , and it drives people to extremes .\nIn reality , the only extremists are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fossil fuels , all for the billions in profits they are trying to make .", "author": "araines", "url":

off fossil fuels as fast as we can to avert the worst case scenarios of suffering from the climate crisis It \u2019 s a tough year for the climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNot only has Congress yet to pass a transformative climate change bill , but we \u2019 re also dealing with a radical , partisan Supreme Court that \u2019 s chipping away at settled law and broadly-understood powers of agencies .\nThis includes the recent decision to limit the scope of power of the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) under the West Virginia vs. Environmental Protection Agency ruling .\nWhile it is still awful news , it is crucial to know that there is still a lot that the EPA can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s a lot that President Biden can do .\nFollowing the recent Court \u2019 s decision , President Biden said : \u201c I will take action .\nMy Administration will continue using lawful executive authority , including the EPA \u2019 s legally-upheld authorities , to keep our air clean , protect public health , and tackle the climate crisis.\n\u201d We \u2019 re done waiting , President Biden .\nYou and your administration must act right now .\nCongress and the Courts are failing to protect our communities from the climate crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden to be the leader we need .\nBy declaring a climate emergency , President Biden unlocks an expanded set of powers under the National Emergencies Act and other federal laws .\nThe move is supported by the Congressional Progressive Caucus ( CPC ) .\nWhat could happen under a climate emergency ?\nThere \u2019 s many actions the administration could take , here \u2019 s a few that would have immediate impact : \u2022 None 1 ) Work with Secretary of the Interior Haaland to end fossil fuel leasing on public lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and land from any more pollution , contamination , or destruction at the hands of Big Oil .\n\u2022 None 2 ) Halt the export of crude oil through reinstating the export ban .\nThe ban existed for forty years , and since it was lifted US exports have skyrocketed , as have associated greenhouse gas emissions .\n\u2022 3 ) Expand on the under Defense Production Act to spur domestic manufacturing and create millions of good-paying union jobs ; President Biden must continue to work with Congress to ensure the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic energy efficiency and renewable energy markets to build domestic renewable energy markets and build the stable , affordable , and reliable energy sources of the future as we continue to wean ourselves off fossil fuels .\nThe United States Senate is completely overrun with political cronies of the fossil fuel industry .\nThere are dozens of politicians across both parties \u2013 with Senator Joe Manchin the current ringleader .\nHe \u2019 s received $ 917,027 from 2017 \u2013 2022 in fossil fuel donations , and he has personally gotten rich off coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving the industry exactly what they paid for : stopping any meaningful action against oil and gas .\nPresident Biden and Majority Leader Schumer are currently working behind closed-doors to get some version of the Build Back Better Act passed .\nThis must happen , and it must include the environmental justice and frontline community funding , and worker protection measures that the original version of the bill included .\nThis is a crucial part of President Biden \u2019 s environmental justice agenda .\nThe impacts of President Biden \u2019 s request for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on gasoline on the price of gas are questionable .\nA far better answer to Big Oil \u2019 s greed would be passing Rep. Khanna \u2019 s and Sen. Whitehouse \u2019 s Big Oil Windfall Profits tax that would tax corporate profiteering and provide consumers with money back in their pockets via a quarterly rebate .\nOil and gas companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron have raked in billions of dollars while drivers are saddled with high gas prices .\nWe must target the root cause : the power of the fossil fuel industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Big Oil Windfall profits tax is a short-term act , it would have meaningful and long-term impacts on shifting power away from the industry and empowering everyday people .\nThe West Virginia vs. EPA ruling concerned one narrow tool within the Environmental Protection Agency \u2019 s toolkit .\nThe Biden administration still has many tools still at their disposal that are ready for immediate use .\nThe EPA can continue to regulate emissions through National Ambient Air Quality Standards ( NAQQs ) and Hazardous Air Pollutants ( HAPs ) standards .\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is updating the EPA \u2019 s standards on other specific pollutants , including a number of toxic substances and particulate matter .\nEarlier this year , the Congressional Progressive Caucus asked Biden to direct the EPA to : \u2022 None \u201c Protect Americans \u2019 health and save tens of thousands of lives annually by updating and strengthening outdated standards limiting particulate matter , ozone , carbon dioxide , sulfur dioxide , mercury , coal ash , and tailpipe emissions , as well as lead and copper rules preventing contamination of drinking water .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and existing oil and gas operations .\nMake these standards strong enough to cut methane pollution at least 65 percent below 2012 levels by 2025 .\n\u2022 None Direct the EPA to designate greenhouse pollutants as criteria air pollutants and set a science-based national pollution cap under the Clean Air Act.\n\u201d While many of the implications of the WV vs. EPA decision are still being assessed , many of the directives listed here should remain within the authority of the EPA .\n4 .\nInvest in a Just Transition Now As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy system that creates union jobs and protects communities , we need to ensure that justice and equity are embedded throughout the process .\nThis means ensuring at least 40 % of benefits and funding are directed to Environmental Justice communities \u2013 EJ40 .\nInvestment should be particularly directed into Black , Indigenous , and communities of color that are subject to disproportionate pollution from existing fossil fuel infrastructure and other historical pollution .\nA just transition also means leveraging all tools available in the Federal government to invest in creating new , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build the industries of the future .\nThis is crucial to ensure there is a plan for a better future for communities that have borne the brunt of fossil fuel racism .\nThe Biden administration has voiced their support for creating good union jobs and for environmental justice , and some of this is already being incorporated into the clean energy executive actions from June .\nFor example , the Department of Energy will be hosting a series of workshops in implementing the Defense Production Act for clean energy manufacturing that will include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions and workers to help direct the implementation forward .\nBoth EJ40 and strong labor standards must be central aspects of a just transition , but have yet to be fully defined .\nAt the same time , the Biden Administration \u2019 s track record on his Environmental Justice 40 initiative has been a disappointment for many .\nThe administration must ensure it \u2019 s living up to its commitments and promises to the communities that have been affected the most .\n\u201c Environmental Justice \u201d must be embedded as a core guiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Money , money , money .\nThe US financial system is the veins through which the heart of the economy beats , and right now the entire body is sick and diseased .\nThe Biden administration can make the financial system more equitable and effective by confronting the ongoing link between finance and the fossil fuel industry .\nThe first step is passing a strong climate disclosure rule through the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) .\nAdmittedly , this is pretty boring stuff , but it \u2019 s a major part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad , planet destroying stuff , and towards the good sustainable future we all deserve .\nThis would require publicly-traded companies to report on the risks that climate change poses to their business and the risks their operations pose to the climate .\nThis is of the utmost importance , as it would provide much needed transparency on how businesses are willingly sacrificing the climate to boost their quarterly profits .\nThis disclosure rule would give investors the choice to shift their investments based on the real impacts businesses have on the environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad campaigns they put out .\nThe US is lagging behind the rest of the world regarding regulating the climate impact of investments , and there is a lot more distance the Biden Administration can cover .\nEarlier this year , Sarah Bloom Raskin \u2013 an attorney , regulator , and former Deputy Secretary of the Treasury who has written on the powers the Federal Reserve has to stimulate the transition to a clean , green economy \u2013 was forced to withdraw her nomination to the Federal Reserve Board as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her .\nThis opposition demonstrates power the Federal Reserve has to act on climate , otherwise the fossil fuel industry wouldn \u2019 t have tanked her nomination .\nThe Federal Reserve has a mandate to maintain the financial stability of the United States , and its failure to fully incorporate the risks of , say , a dying planet and ecosystem collapse are huge gaps in its responsibility .\nUnder the right leadership , the Federal Reserve would be able to take actions that shift the flows of finance away from the unstable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so happens that averting climate disaster would have a positive effect on the financial industry .\nBeyond the US financial system , President Biden can and should do more with the public dollars he has control of .\nThis includes curtailing private investment into fossil fuel projects abroad , and working to use all levers of the government to end domestic and international fossil fuel subsidies .\nThese are things President Biden and numerous members of Congress have promised to deliver , but have failed to do so up until this point .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ are only some of the immediate tools the Biden administration and Congress can immediately use in the fight for climate justice and equitable climate policy .\nThe fight is far from over .\nRemember , the Federal government is only one pathway towards the future we want to see .\nJoin us in the fight .\nSee if there \u2019 s a local Greenpeace Action pod in your area or start one with your friends .\nActions in your own community , especially when paired with pushing our top leaders to do more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to our end goal of a more just , equitable , and green future .",

country experienced deadly heat waves , drought , and flood\u2014President Biden announced that his administration would take executive actions to combat the Climate Emergency .\nThe president \u2019

is an emergency declaration ?\nEmergency powers have existed in the U.S. and other countries around the world to enhance the president \u2019 s powers in emergencies and unexpected crises that are moving too fast for Congress to respond to timely and appropriately .\nThe National Emergency Act ( NEA ) was enacted in 1976 to enhance presidential powers in emergencies .\nWhile the act doesn \u2019 t define an emergency , it provides a framework and mechanisms to ensure the stability and legitimacy of executive decisions .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically end after one year unless POTUS publishes a renewal notice to the Federal Register , upon a presidential declaration ending the emergency , or if Congress vetoes the emergency .\nThere are currently 37 national emergency

SCOTUS environmental decisions and the Inflation Reduction Act falling short of the benchmarks set by science , the need for a Climate Emergency declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action .\nIn an emergency declaration , POTUS could reinstate the crude oil export ban , take action on leasing of public lands and waters , and move forward with his climate agenda in a timely manner.\n, In other words , President Biden can do a lot .\nA few things we hope to see include : \u2022 None Working with Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland to end fossil fuel leasing on public lands and waters to protect them from any further pollution , contamination , or destruction at the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the export of crude oil by reinstating the export ban .\nThe ban existed for 40 years , and since it was lifted US exports have skyrocketed , as have associated greenhouse gas emissions .\n\u2022 None Expanding on the June 6th order under the Defense Production Act to spur electric transportation development and create millions of good-paying union jobs .\nOil leases are required to have a clause for national emergencies 43 USC 1341 under the reservation of lands and rights .\nUpon recommendations of the Secretary of Defense under a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations will be suspended under any leases .\nSince climate change is caused by fossil fuels , this provision should be put in place .\nAccording to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute , fossil fuels accounted for 74 % of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 and 25 % of those emissions came from public lands .\nFossil fuels have widespread effects on the environment including air pollution .\nThese hazardous air pollutants will damage crops , forests , and harm wildlife .\nThose externalities negatively affect the natural environment , food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to the USDA , in 2020 more than 38 million people including 6.1 million children in the United States live in food insecure households .\nAlso , extreme health issues continuously result from our dependency on fossil fuels including asthma , cancer , and premature deaths that disproportionately affect frontline communities .\nInitially led by Exxon and the American Petroleum Institute , oil producers began huge lobbying efforts in 2013 to overturn the U.S. ban on exporting crude oil .\nIn 2015 , U.S. politicians approved lifting a 40-year ban on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $ 1.1 trillion spending bill .\nThis allowed U.S. oil producers to export oil to an already saturated international market after U.S. production nearly doubled from 2009 to 2015 .\nThis overturn is associated with an increase in exports from less than half a million barrels per day in 2015 to almost a million barrels per day in 2019 according to a report by U.S Government Accountability Office .\nAccording to a report by Greenpeace and Oil Change International , reinstating the ban will reduce global CO2 emissions by as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year which is the equivalent of the yearly emissions from 19 to 42 coal-fired power plants .\nThrough executive powers and emergency declaration , President Biden could reinstate the crude oil export ban and effectively reduce fossil fuel production when combined with a renewable energy transition .\nPOTUS can do even more with an emergency declaration under the Defense Production Act ( DPA ) from the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) .\nPresident Biden \u2019 s original climate agenda was built on increasing domestic clean energy manufacturing .\nOn June 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defense Production Act to boost the domestic production of technologies essential for decarbonization\u2014like solar\u2014and further transitioning off of fossil fuels .\nThe DPA allows the president

John Kerry .\nAs the second-largest emitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must act now if we \u2019 re going to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis .\nIf President Biden follows through on his promise to declare a Climate Emergency would help put us back on track to protect the health of our communities by preventing even worse climate disasters .\nIt would also reestablish our country \u2019 s

the rights of workers , and safeguard our oceans .\nBumble Bee Tuna is making waves again !\nBut , sadly , not for any of the reasons we would hope , like taking meaningful action to fulfill their promises on corporate social responsibility and sustainability to people and planet \u2014 promises that are supposed to extend through their supply chain .\nTheir latest marketing campaign is full of happy , smiling people , enjoying a taste of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nutritious , and \u201c Good For You.\n\u201d But a recent Greenpeace East Asia report has once again found that Bumble Bee may not be telling us the whole story .\nFake My Catch : the unreliable traceability in our tuna cans finds that Bumble Bee is not doing enough to keep forced labor and environmental destruction out of their supply chain .\nAfter reading the report , we can \u2019 t help but wonder \u2014 Bumble Bee : # GoodForWho ?\nThe report finds that of a sampling of 119 Taiwanese-flagged/owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 % ( 13 ) had violated Taiwan Fishery Agency regulations and were on their Illegal , Unreported , and Unregulated ( IUU ) list .\nThe report also alleges that some vessels supplying Bumble Bee had reportedly engaged in shark finning and illegal fishing .\nAdditionally , Greenpeace East Asia \u2019 s interviews with fishers who worked aboard some of the vessels supplying Bumble Bee revealed that workers reportedly labored excessive overtime hours while having their wages withheld .\nOthers stated that their documents were retained , a practice sometimes used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or prevent fishers from leaving or terminating their contracts early .\nAnd , unfortunately , it doesn \u2019 t stop there .\nWhat was particularly alarming to learn was that a canned Bumble Bee product I picked up at my neighborhood grocery store , Harris Teeter in Arlington , Virginia , contained fish sourced from the Da Wang \u2014 a vessel that was recently confirmed by US Customs & Border Protection to have employed forced labor .\nGreenpeace research found that a Bumble Bee tuna can was sourced from DA WANG , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have indicators of forced labor by US Customs and Border Protection .\nThe stories that have emerged about the working conditions onboard the Da Wang have been nothing short of horrifying .\nMigrant fishers reported facing physical abuse onboard and one worker even died after an accident where he was reportedly hit on the back of the head .\nWhile an autopsy found the cause of the death was not directly linked to this incident , according to prosecutors it nonetheless prompted 19 foreign crew members to quit , reportedly because they couldn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were subjected to aboard the ship .\nIn April this year , the vessel \u2019 s captain , first mate , and seven others were indicted by Taiwanese authorities for their involvement in forced labor and human trafficking .\nThat Bumble Bee is sourcing from a vessel with such a horrible track record is not surprising .\nFor years , the Greenpeace network has monitored and documented the widespread occurrence of human rights abuses in the seafood supply chain .\nInvestigative reports and case studies from a wide variety of other sources , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also revealed how common issues like long working hours , deplorable working conditions , wage theft , and even physical abuse are in this distant water fishing industry .\nBumble Bee and its Taiwanese parent company , Fong Chun Formosa ( FCF ) , have previously been linked to these issues in their supply chain .\nGiven this history , and my own recent discovery of a can of tuna possibly tainted with human rights abuse on the shelf of the supermarket in my neighborhood , we must question how many more such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. What this report makes clear though , is that Bumble Bee \u2019 s own transparency tool , Trace My Catch , which allows consumers to track where and how its tuna was caught , is not going to help us get answers to these questions .\nThe information shared on this site is sometimes not only insufficient but also incorrect \u2014 making this tool a mere smokescreen for transparency .\nScreenshot from Bumble Bee \u2019 s \u201c Trace My Catch \u201d showing that it sourced tuna from Da Wang Bumble Bee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these issues .\nIn March 2021 , after several months of advocacy , Greenpeace delivered a petition signed by thousands of Americans , demanding that the corporation take action to prevent these abuses .\nBumble Bee failed to meaningfully respond .\nAnd while they have since quietly updated their supplier code of conduct to include some language against forced labor , their efforts have been far from enough .\nYet , this has done nothing to dampen the zeal with which they continue to market their commitments to responsible and sustainable sourcing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence .\nGreenpeace advocates , one dressed in a shark costume , delivered a petition demanding that Bumble Bee protect human rights on behalf of over 25,000 signers .\nAmericans want better .\nWe want to know that the seafood we \u2019 re eating is sourced sustainably .\nBumble Bee , as one of the leading companies in the canned tuna market , and FCF , one of the top three global tuna traders , play important roles in the global tuna industry .\nThey have the power to impact the health of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at sea .\nGreenpeace Oceans Director John Hocevar looks at canned tuna on a store shelf .\nAs a first step towards this , Bumble Bee and FCF must ensure more transparency in their supply chain and provide information that is comprehensive , correct , and readily available .\nThey must also heed the demands of the thousands of Americans asking them to clean up their supply chain , protect the rights of workers , and safeguard our oceans .\nNow THAT truly would not only be \u201c Good For You \u201d but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take action now : Tell Bumble Bee Tuna to protect workers in its supply

"From Climate Denial to Democracy Denial : Big Oil Money is Polluting Politics and the Planet With more than 70 % of Americans concerned about the climate crisis , Big Oil CEOs stand to gain the most from drowning out our voices .\nThat explains why the industry isn \u2019 t just watching attacks on our democracy unfold : it \u2019 s fueling them .\nThe January 6th , 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol was a violent effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election , but it was not an isolated event .\nThe former president and his cronies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud claims , filing baseless lawsuits , and colluding to deliver \u201c fake electors.\n\u201d Even after the attack , 147 congresspeople ignored our country \u2019 s democratic values and clung to Trump \u2019 s false narrative by voting not to certify the election .\nThey \u2019 ve become known as the \u201c Sedition Caucus.\n\u201d Since the January 6 attack , we \u2019 ve seen election denial become a tool to advance voter suppression .\nExtremist politicians are spreading misinformation about the 2020 election to give cover to their racist voting laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s worked .\nAt the same time , they are enacting \u201c anti-protest \u201d laws , in many cases authored almost word-for-word by Big Oil lobbyists .\nThese laws are a win for right-wing extremists and a loss for democracy .\nBig Oil is donating huge sums to the Sedition Caucus and politicians stripping back our democratic rights .\nAt the same time , industry-linked groups are backing efforts to block legislation with overwhelmingly popular electoral reforms , allowing Big Oil to grow their influence and profits .\nThe good news is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our democracy , and we can implement strong democratic reforms if we make our voices heard .\nThe Sedition Caucus and Big Oil are pushing a radical , unpopular , and unscientific agenda .\nNot only did the Sedition Caucus deny the results of the 2020 election , they also have a record of voting against climate policy 94 % of the time and denying the scientific consensus of climate change .\nBy comparison , a supermajority of Americans support strong climate policies .\nThe watchdog organization CREW ( Citizens for Responsibility and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from companies giving the most to the 147 congresspeople denying our elections .\nThey uncovered that just six Big Oil PACs have donated more than $ 2.2 million to fuel the Sedition Caucus since the January 6 attack .\nKoch Industries , an oil corporation that is the second largest privately-held company in America , is at the top of the list at more than $ 1 million in PAC donations .\nBut these donations are the tip of the iceberg .\nThe industry has donated more than $ 13 million to fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its corporate PACs and large individual donations are counted .\nThat includes $ 3.1 million to the National Republican Senatorial Committee , which sells MAGA-branded T-shirts with the slogan \u201c STILL MY PRESIDENT , \u201d and $ 5.4 million to the National Republican Congressional Committee , whose Deputy Chairs for the 2022 election cycle are all Sedition Caucus members .\nThe rest went straight to Sedition Caucus members , most of whom are running for re-election in November .\n\u201c Shadow groups \u201d with fossil fuel ties have also spent big on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans for Prosperity Action .\nFueling the politicians who are stripping back our democratic rights Greenpeace USA found that 22 companies involved with producing , transporting , or distributing fossil fuels donated $ 1.26 million to sponsors of state anti-protest bills in the last election cycle ( 2019-2020 ) .\nMany of these bills are almost word for word copies of language provided by ALEC ( the American Legislative Exchange Council ) , which has received millions of dollars from Big Oil .\nThese bills threaten peaceful protesters with long-term imprisonment , felony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when civil disobedience remains a crucial tool for protecting our democracy and the environment .\nSome bills even grant immunity to drivers who hit protestors with their car .\nBig Oil \u2019 s money is also funding politicians that are attacking our right to vote .\nDuring this election cycle , 8 fossil fuel companies have donated $ 778,000 to politicians who supported anti-voter legislation , according to Accountable.US .\nWorking class people of color will have a harder time voting and their ballots will more likely be disqualified because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThese attacks on our democracy are fueled by disinformation , as well as corporate donations .\nDespite some fossil fuel companies having condemned the January 6 attack , the industry has a decades-long history of spreading disinformation that is not entirely separate from what we see now .\nThe fossil fuel industry has funded groups involved with planning the \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d rally , or whose senior personnel promoted the rally online , in the past .\nSpecial interests have an enormous amount of political power in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do spend astronomical amounts to influence elections , often with poor disclosure practices .\nThe problem is now worse than ever : secretive spending has gone up by 20 times and billionaire spending has multiplied by 70 since 2006 .\nYet , a national poll showed that Americans in both parties do not want billionaires buying our elections .\nTo the contrary , there is overwhelming support for reeling in unchecked political giving and influence .\nSo why hasn \u2019 t Big Oil \u2019 s political influence been reeled in ?\nThe blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s vast political network .\nAccording to The New Yorker , the Koch-run advocacy group Stand Together has coordinated closely with Republican leadership to oppose electoral reform , even when it was supported by conservative voters .\nThese groups decided to ignore the will of the American people by plotting to block the Freedom to Vote Act : John R. Lewis Act ( originally titled the For the People Act ) , a landmark electoral reform bill , earlier this year .\nMore recently , the Chamber of Commerce and the Heritage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fossil fuel companies , opposed the DISCLOSE Act that would have required increased transparency into political donations .\nThe Fossil Fuel Industry is trying to suppress the power of the people and silence our voices .\nBut we won \u2019 t stop fighting .\nBig Oil \u2019 s support for the insurrection caucus , anti-democracy politicians , and secretive political spending follow a broad pattern of stoking attacks on the rights of average Americans .\nTheir support feeds into racist voter suppression and the spread of dangerous disinformation that undermines the fabric of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u2022 \u2022 Vote on November 8 ( or sooner , if your state has early voting ) .\nThe good news is that recent polls have found that the threat to American democracy is one of the top concerns of likely midterm voters .\nWhatever our color , background , or zip code , we must come out in droves to vote for new leaders who will protect our freedom to vote and pass laws that will enable progress on our climate goals .\nNow \u2019 s the best time to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do the same .\n\u2022 Continue pushing for strong democracy reforms at the state and federal levels .\nThat includes rolling back voter restriction laws and pushing for pro-democracy reforms .\n\u2022 Counter disinformation .\nWe must continue to fight back against disinformation by educating ourselves and one another , and , even more importantly , holding Big Oil accountable for decades of misleading the public .", "author": "Valentina Stackl", "url":

lobsters ?\nClimate change has made it even harder to estimate how many fish there are , and how many there will be next year or the year after .\nAre the fish gone , or did they move ?\nEarlier this month , Alaska Department of Fish and Game announced that this year \u2019 s snow crab fishery is canceled , with CNN and others reporting that billions of the crabs had \u201c disappeared.\n\u201d Meanwhile , the Maine lobster industry was rocked by the news that the Monterey Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red listed lobster for the first time following a court ruling affirming that the fishery was putting critically endangered northern Atlantic right whales at risk of extinction .\nA lot of money is at stake , and reactions have been extreme .\nHow did we get here ?\nThe U.S. is proud of its management of commercial fisheries .\nEach year , NOAA reports that the majority of the populations it manages are not overfished , and that overfishing is not occurring .\nOut of 460 stocks , 51 remain overfished , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t know enough about them to be sure if they are overfished or not .\nIt doesn \u2019 t sound all that great , but it is better than it used to be , and better I suppose than many other countries .\nCertainly , the U.S. spends more money and effort on fisheries management than just about anyone else .\nBut the reality is a lot worse than that sounds .\nFisheries management typically treats fish ( or crab , or lobster ) on a single species basis : how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the water while still leaving enough left so they can keep the population going ?\nThis approach typically means trying to remove 60 % of the target population , what managers hope will be a \u201c Maximum Sustainable Yield.\n\u201d It \u2019 s kind of a crazy strategy for a lot of reasons , not least of which is that it is very hard to get right .\nAs John Shepherd said , \u201c counting fish is just like counting trees , except they are invisible and they keep moving.\n\u201d Climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate how many fish there are , and how many there will be next year or the year after .\nAre the fish gone , or did they move ?\nHave their prey or their predators been affected , and what impact will that have ?\nHow does the changing temperature affect their physiology ?\nDo they produce more successful offspring , or fewer ?\nAt a minimum , you would think that fishery managers would want to set more precautionary catch limits to account for climate-driven uncertainty .\nThey don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame climate change if things go wrong .\nThat seems to be what has happened with snow crab \u2013 and maybe with king crab before that .\nTrawlers were dragging up enormous numbers of crabs as bycatch , prompting the U.S. and Japan to set aside trawl-free areas as early as 1964 .\nBut those precautions went out the window in the 70s , and crabs have had no place to hide ever since .\nAs ice conditions shifted and crabs were more exposed , catch limits remained high .\nKing crab populations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapsed as well .\nClimate change is absolutely a factor , but so is greed and arrogance .\nIn my work with Greenpeace , I have had an opportunity to lead two submersible expeditions in the Bering Sea , and to see first hand the impacts of factory trawlers on vulnerable coral and sponge habitats .\nWe made the case that sanctuaries were needed to help protect against uncertainty \u2013 to make sure that we do not disrupt the ecosystem in a way that not only harms biodiversity , but also the fisheries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the North Pacific Fishery Management Council opposed the idea .\nOf the 900,000 square miles of ocean under the Council \u2019 s jurisdiction , none is fully closed to fishing .\nThousands of miles away in a very different fishery , Maine \u2019 s 4,500 lobstermen are grappling with similar challenges .\nThere are some three million lobster pots in Maine \u2019 s waters , creating entanglement hazards for whales and other marine life .\nThe lobstermen do not want to kill whales , of course , but with that much gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed nonetheless .\nThe Endangered Species Act , one of our bedrock environmental laws , requires that measures be taken to prevent extinction .\nSo far , actions taken have fallen short of what is needed \u2013 or required by law .\nThere are now less than 340 northern Atlantic right whales left , down almost a hundred from just ten years ago .\nAs with Alaska \u2019 s snow crabs , climate change has certainly played a factor .\nThere is evidence that climate change has caused whales to shift their migration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlap with fishing areas , for example , and other climate impacts have added to the whales \u2019 precarious state as well .\nBut for crabs and lobsters , and indeed all fisheries , it is time to stop using climate change as an excuse and start acknowledging that we need to take a more precautionary approach .\nWe can no longer afford to set catch limits at the maximum level allowed by laws created 30 years ago .\nAnd we have to act quickly to establish a network of fully protected sanctuaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the mistakes we have already made and to limit the damage from mistakes yet to come .\nOtherwise , as Jennifer Jaquet and Daniel Pauly wrote in a paper published this week , many fisheries labeled as \u201c sustainable \u201d will not ultimately be sustained .", "author": "Jeffrey Harris", "url":

offer hope .\nVoters in these districts can fight back against the industry \u2019 s slate of extremist politicians , helping protect the climate and defend against attacks on our democracy at the

career .\nBetween 2008 and 2010 , Herrell was a legislative assistant for a state representative who introduced unnecessary and restrictive voter ID legislation .\nSimilar bills were introduced across the country , occasionally drawing support from the up-and-coming Tea Party Movement .\nThe thinly-disguised goal of these bills was to make it harder for already-marginalized communities to vote .\nAccording to the NAACP , they were part of a \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Legislative Exchange Council ( ALEC ) , a corporate-funded advocacy group whose sponsors included Koch Industries ,

the first of five conferences to negotiate this potentially game-changing treaty , we need to see the USA , one of the world \u2019 s leading plastics polluters and an influential voice in this negotiation , come in strong with two main priorities : \u2022 An immediate cap on virgin plastic production to 2017 levels , followed by significant , annually increasing reductions in the production and use of plastic .\n\u2022 An end to single-use plastics , starting with the most unnecessary and harmful .\nA strong , UNITED position on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet and support Frontline communities \u2014 often low-income communities of color \u2014 which bear the greatest impacts from the toxic extraction , production , disposal , incineration , and the so-called chemical recycling process .\nAs we negotiate for a strong global plastics treaty that will address the full life cycle of plastics , which includes toxic extraction , production , disposal , and incineration or remediation .\nIt is also critical that this treaty ensures a just transition for workers in the fossil fuel industry and waste workers and their communities across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes dangerous work for corporations in cleaning up their plastic waste .\nYvette Arrellano of Fenceline Watch said , \u201c What do you do when you have so many generations that have been exposed to a problem ?\nWe \u2019

\u2019 s how you can help !\n\u2022 Week of November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Biden that we need a bold and just Global Plastics Treaty .\n\u2022 Sign the petition demanding the Biden Administration

Bitcoin .\nGreenpeace USA is proud of our long history of action to expose and deter global environmental degradation and unjust social and economic systems .\nBringing the truth to light about ecological and social injustice means revealing these abuses and dispelling the swirl of misinformation surrounding many issues \u2014 including Bitcoin mining and its current impact on the climate and local communities living near mining rigs .\nBitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency using the outmoded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( PoW ) consensus mechanism .\nThe \u201c work \u201d is specialized computers racing against one another to solve algorithms and validate transactions on a digital ledger .\nOnce the algorithms are solved and transactions are validated , new digital assets are rewarded to the \u201c miner \u201d of the correct ledger , which is then added to the blockchain ledger .\nThe faster a computer works to solve the algorithmic puzzle , the greater the chances of winning the digital asset .\nSpeed requires massive amounts of energy to run banks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the puzzles become harder to solve , more computer power requires more energy .\nRecent reports estimate that in 2020 , Bitcoin mining used 75.4 TWh/yr of electricity , which is more energy than used by all of Austria in 2020.1 Attempts to ameliorate PoW \u2019 s inherently wasteful process , either by using renewable energy and most other means rather than changing its code , are like putting lipstick on an energy hog .\nLet \u2019 s take a look at some of the misinformation \u2014 and facts \u2014 surrounding Greenpeace USA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFact : We are not against cryptocurrency .\nWe are against the destruction of our climate .\nAs of October 2022 , according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index ( CBECI ) , in 2022 , Bitcoin mining emitted 48.35 MtCO2e of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions2 , equal to over 285,000 rail cars of coal burned in one year or over 10,300,000 car miles driven in one year3 .\nWe want Bitcoin and other Proof of Work cryptocurrencies to switch to a low-energy consensus mechanism .\nWe are agnostic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least as efficient as Proof of Stake , which uses 99.5 % less electricity than Proof of Work .\nWe are fully aware of the barriers to doing so , but it is technically and politically possible to change the code , as the recent Ethereum merge demonstrated .\nWe are also against environmental pollution and other impacts , such as electricity rate hikes affecting local communities living near mining rigs .\nAs electricity demand increases from cryptoasset mining , more coal-power and natural gas-powered plants are used to provide electricity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost more to operate and create noise , water , and air pollution .\nCoal combustion produces fine particles of sulfur dioxide , nitrogen oxides , and other air toxins .\nPollution controls are rarely deployed by the cryptocurrency mining company using the power from these fossil-fuel plants unless pushed to do so by regulators.4 These local impacts can also worsen existing environmental injustices burdening neighboring communities .\nThis Environmental Working Group article summarizes local impacts and quotes local organizations fighting for a healthy environment .\nFact : Global Bitcoin mining is overwhelmingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index ( CBECI ) research , Bitcoin mining \u2019 s largest single energy source is coal.5 The research found that coal and other fossil fuels ( like oil and gas ) account for almost two-thirds of the total electricity mix ( 62.4 % ) , and only 26.3 % are renewables and 11.3 % from nuclear power.6 According to The Energy Bomb : How Proof-of-Work Cryptocurrency Mining Worsens the Climate Crisis and Harms Communities Now , a September 2022 guidebook by Earthjustice and Sierra Club , cryptocurrency mining companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run on renewable energy simply because they are located near wind or solar farms .\nHowever , these mining companies don \u2019 t have a contractual relationship with those that operate renewable power sources7 The guidebook explains , \u201c But simply locating new demand in a region rich in renewable resources does not mean that the new demand is served by the renewable resources of that region .\nWhen a load is added to the grid , it is served by the generation available on the grid at the time electricity is consumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be built for its exclusive use ) .\nLarge loads , like cryptocurrency mining operations , can cause changes in the generation mix as the grid dispatch patterns shift in response to the new load \u2019 s requirements .\nIn almost every circumstance , new demand drives an instantaneous increase in the output of fossil generators.8 \u201d Even if Bitcoin mining could be entirely fueled by renewable power , the amount of clean generation needed by the insatiable mining operations simply doesn \u2019 t exist .\nResidential , commercial , and industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among other essential areas , must be prioritized for this future use of renewable generation .\nMyth : Cryptocurrency mining can store energy to be used when electricity consumption is high , like during an extended heat wave .\nFact : Electricity used by a mining operation can not be exported or redeployed elsewhere , nor can it provide energy storage capacity or optimize the functioning of the grid.9 When miners increase the demand on the electrical grid , they typically increase electricity rates for all customers .\nFor example , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses collectively paid $ 244 million more in higher electric bills in one year due to Bitcoin mining in their area10 .\nAlso , by increasing demand on the electrical grid , miners spur demand response utility programs and associated costs.11 ERCOT , Texas \u2019 s independent market monitor , estimates that Texans could pay an additional $ 1.5 billion for electricity in 2022 , partly to cover payment to cryptocurrency miners that shut down operations during peak demand.12 When one industrial entity such as a Bitcoin mining operation needs large amounts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and electricity costs and diminishes grid reliability for all customers .\nMyth : Bitcoin mining helps the climate by using natural gas that would usually be burned in a process known as flaring , which emits GHGs .\nFact : Using flared gas might be better than letting it emit climate-polluting gases , but it is a pollutant that should be regulated and controlled by state and local authorities .\nThe September 2022 White House Office of Science and Technology Policy report found that while using flared gas can reduce the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing vapor capture technologies at oil and gas wells , which can reduce global methane emissions up to 50 % by 2030.13 Instead , Bitcoin mining \u2019 s use of flared gas incentivizes more oil and gas drilling , as it converts what would be a loss for drillers into a new revenue source14 .\nAdditionally , when regulators locate and inspect wellheads used by miners , they find violations .\nFor example , in January 2022 , Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection inspectors found that 30 methane-gas-fired generators used for cryptocurrency mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The purchase of carbon credits , renewable energy certificates , or the use of verifiable renewable energy can offset GHG emissions from Bitcoin mining .\nFact : Carbon credits or offsets permit the credit owner to emit a certain amount of greenhouse gases .\nOne credit equals one ton of carbon dioxide emissions or the equivalent of other greenhouse gases .\nRenewable Energy certificates ( RECs ) are issued when one megawatt-hour ( MWh ) of electricity is generated and delivered to the electricity grid from a renewable energy resource .\nBoth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas emissions .\nHowever , they are increasingly viewed as a \u201c complementary tool or additional tool \u201d that should not delay or be a substitute for GHG emission reductions within a company \u2019 s or industry \u2019 s activities.16 Bitcoin miners often claim to be \u201c carbon neutral \u201d after purchasing these offsets or renewable energy certificates .\nCredits can be controversial , verification is complex , and may not reduce carbon pollution in many instances.17 While a mining operation using renewable energy can be independently verified as doing so , other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial production , should be prioritized as we need to transition to a clean energy economy rapidly .\nThe key is to reduce the massive amounts of energy used for Bitcoin mining in the first place , not create a problem , and seek creative new ways to ameliorate the impact.18 1 Page 2 Jones , B.A.\n, Goodkind , A.L .\n& Berrens , R.P .\nEconomic estimation of Bitcoin mining \u2019 s climate damages demonstrates closer

shatter previous records .\nPhillips 66 brought in $ 5.4 billion in profits , up from $ 402 million .\nMarathon \u2019 s profits reached $ 4.48 billion , up 545 % from this same time last year .\nThese numbers are astronomical .\nAs Governor Newsom said just last month : \u201c greedy oil companies are ripping you off.\n\u201d And with eight oil companies operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 100 days during the third quarter of 2022 , this is an extremely fair characterization .\nGreedy oil CEOs are \u2018 feasting \u2019 on a series of calamities and catastrophes \u2013 allowing them to rake in record high profits , far beyond other years \u2019 margins .\nThere is a clear connection \u2013 the record high prices are going straight to profit .\nIt \u2019 s past time for basic accountability for Big Oil \u2019 s big profits .\nYou all have the opportunity to protect your constituents and ensure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without any action by legislators , the price gouging will continue .\nWith a cap on this greed , everyday Californians can have happier , healthier , and less stressful lives \u2013 all while the fossil fuel industry will absolutely continue to make a standard profit .\nIt is not uncommon for the oil and gas industry and its allies to claim they have the mantle of looking out for working Californians on any number of issues \u2013 but we can see clear as day that this is simply a myth .\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers at a refinery in Richmond , California , were forced to go out on strike for several months without pay , demanding meager pay increases to account for the cost of living in the Bay Area .\nEven though Chevron posted massive quarterly profits during the strike , they wouldn \u2019 t budge an inch .\nThe same corporate greed that hurts everyday Californians at the gas pump is also hurting the very same industry \u2019 s workers who aren \u2019 t immune from that price at the pump , even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what \u2019 s more , climate change , propelled by oil companies , hurts workers plain and simple .\nThe heatwaves and wildfire this state went through over the summer are but mere examples .\nWorkers are forced to endure dangerous temperatures , dealing with toxic levels of wildfire smoke , and any number of health and safety hazards brought on by the climate crisis .\nSadly , all of this is nothing new .\nPolluter greed has been harming our state and hurting its people for far too long with little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFor decades , the oil industry \u2019 s massive profits have funded their disinformation campaigns and powerful lobby to delay climate action , while dumping pollution into neighborhoods and treating communities as sacrifice zones .\nToo many of you in the Legislature have fallen beholden to this industry because of the massive amount of money it pumps into California state politics .\nBut that money is not more important than standing up for what is right for your constituents , who are paying far more than is necessary at the gas pump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these companies leave behind their aging oil and gas drilling infrastructure , using shady lobbying of regulators , bankruptcy , or other legal maneuvers to try to pass off the bill for cleanup to taxpayers .\nIt \u2019 s a story as old as the industry itself \u2013 they pass on their costs to consumers , who are struggling just to make it to their jobs everyday , all in the name of passing the wealth to CEOs and top executives .\nThe oil industry is currently spending their record profits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action on climate change , and attempt to overturn public health protections for communities living next to toxic oil drilling sites .\nYour leadership and commitment back in August resulted in the passage of SB 1137 , which establishes a 3,200-foot buffer zone between oil wells and communities in California .\nGreenpeace USA and our supporters will not forget those of you who decided to side with California communities on this issue .\nBut now the oil industry is spending millions of its record profits to overturn this popular setback policy and brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shutdown \u201d \u2013 just as fast food companies are corrupting the democratic process with a flood of money to overturn the fair fight on better wages for fast food workers .\nNot to mention , Big Oil is trying to use this moment to push for new drilling permits in order to entice investors and maximize profits .\nBut new drilling will not lower the cost of fuel .\nAnd approving new permits won \u2019 t reduce pain at the pumps \u2013 it will only help Big Oil maintain a permanent grip on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our wallets .\nCalifornians deserve better than they \u2019 re getting \u2013 and oil and gas companies can not be allowed to run rampant all over California .\nReining in profits is popular both with the people of California and with Governor Newsom himself .\nYou have a responsibility and power to protect California families against greedy polluters bleeding the state dry .\nI \u2019 m writing , urging you to put an end to the oil and gas industry \u2019 s record windfall profits .\nIt \u2019 s better for people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our democracy .\nCalifornia \u2019 s communities and families are asking you to stand with them and Governor Newsom in protecting Californians against polluter greed .\nBig Oil \u2019 s windfall profits are threatening the very place we call home .", "author": "Amy Moas", "url":

agreement that will reduce plastic production and use , hold big polluters accountable , build refill and reuse systems , and empower those most affected by the plastic pollution crisis .\nCoastal communities and environmental and social organizations celebrated the decision of the Federal Court of Mar del Plata against seismic blasting in the Argentine Sea .\nThe court \u2019 s decision to

\u2019 right to clean air .\nThe President and the other defendants had submitted an appeal but in October this year , the high judicial council upheld the initial decision , scoring a second win for the citizens and their right to clean air .\nOn 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Philippines \u2019 Commission on Human Rights ( CHR ) released its final report on the world \u2019 s first investigation into corporate responsibility for the climate crisis and declared that climate change is a human rights issue .\nThe groundbreaking investigation had been going since 2015 when the first-ever human rights

called on states to step up efforts to ensure their people have access to a \u201c clean , healthy and sustainable environment.\n\u201d While this is an impressive milestone , the resolution is not legally binding on the 193 UN Member States but rather an encouragement for states to implement laws to protect people and the environment .\nIt also paves the way for climate and environmental litigation by people and organisations around the world against environmentally destructive policies and projects .\nBuffer zone for new oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed Senate Bill 1137 , banning new oil and
