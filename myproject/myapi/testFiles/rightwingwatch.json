The Right-Wing War for Control of the Insurrection Narrative", "content": "In the immediate aftermath of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol , a battle broke out for control of the narrative regarding the events of that day .\nThe battle was not between the left and the right , but rather between varying factions of the right-wing movement , as a variety of MAGA activists sought to shape the narrative about what had unfolded at the Capitol .\nWould they take pride in the Trump loyalists storming the Capitol , or would they baselessly blame the insurrection on left-wing insurgents ?\nTo objective outside observers , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump had violently stormed the Capitol in an effort to intimidate members of Congress into refusing to certify Joe Biden \u2019 s victory in the 2020 election .\nThreats of violence had filled social media and calls for war and revolution were ubiquitous at right-wing rallies in the days and weeks leading up to Jan. 6 .\nAs such , it was no surprise when MAGA activists immediately began praising the \u201c patriots \u201d who stormed the Capitol in the days after Jan. 6 .\nFor example , just two days after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guandolo praised the insurrectionists for showing remarkable \u201c restraint \u201d by not summarily executing the \u201c traitors \u201d in Congress .\nA few days later , Guandolo asserted that those who condemned the insurrection were \u201c enemies of the republic \u201d and should be \u201c swinging from a rope because these are traitors to the country.\n\u201d QAnon conspiracy theorist DeAnna Lorraine was equally proud of the \u201c patriots \u201d who ransacked the Capitol .\nLorraine , who had been covering the Jan. 6 events for radical conspiracy theorist Alex Jones \u2019 InfoWars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way back to Texas in which she gushed that she had \u201c never felt more pride in my heart and soul than yesterday.\n\u201d Lorraine lashed out at those in the MAGA movement who were already trying to distance themselves from the insurrection by falsely blaming the attack on the Capitol on left-wing activists .\n\u201c No one should be blaming antifa for what happened , \u201d Lorraine said .\n\u201c American patriots did this .\nAnd it \u2019 s a good thing .\nIt \u2019 s not a bad thing.\n\u201d Likewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jan. 5 so-called Stop the Steal rally who has since pleaded guilty to joining the mob storming the Capitol , took to Twitter on Jan. 6 to shame conservatives who weren \u2019 t supporting \u201c freedom loving Patriots \u201d storming the Capitol .\n\u201c Be embarrassed & hide if you need to- but I was there .\nIt was not Antifa at the Capitol .\nIt was freedom loving Patriots who were DESPERATE to fight for the final hope of our Republic because literally nobody cares about them .\nEveryone else can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Straka wrote on Twitter , according to a criminal complaint .\nNot everyone agreed with Lorraine\u200b and Straka \u2019 s assessment .\n\u200bEven as Trump loyalists fought Capitol police , right-wing conspiracy theorists like Lin Wood and Mark Burns took to various social media platforms to claim that \u201c antifa \u201d \u2014conservatives \u2019 shorthand for anti-fascist activists\u2014was behind the attack .\nFox News personality Laura Ingraham\u2014whom the House select committee revealed to have pleaded with Trump \u2019 s chief of staff to get Trump to tell his supporters to go home on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours following the attack to claim \u201c antifa sympathizers may have been sprinkled throughout the crowd.\n\u201d Fox News hosts Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson echoed similar messages .\nPerhaps nobody better illustrates the \u201c blame antifa \u201d camp than former Rep. Michele Bachmann .\nJust hours after the insurrection , Bachmann was baselessly declaring those who breached security and ran loose through the Capitol were actually left-wing \u201c rabble-rousers paid to put together a coup.\n\u201d In the following weeks , Bachmann repeatedly insisted that the attack on the Capitol was actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d \u201c It is my opinion that this was a theatrical event that the progressive left put on , \u201d Bachmann said .\n\u201c The individuals who were the instigators , who brought this about , these were agitators brought in to create this problem .\nI believe it was specifically done to rebrand Donald Trump as being an insurrectionist and a leader of a terrorist movement .\nI also believe that this was done to rebrand the Make America Great agenda\u2014because remember , that was considered extremely popular by about 80 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great as an evil thing and those of us who supported Donald Trump and that agenda as evil and terrorists.\n\u201d By July , Bachmann was claiming that MAGA activists had nothing to do with the events of Jan. 6 and that left-wing activists dressed in black clothing had been bused in to attack the Capitol .\n\u201c There were some bad actors who had climbed up \u2026 and they actually were pounding on the glass , \u201d Bachmann claimed .\n\u201c Now , a normal person doesn \u2019 t do that .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound on the glass .\nI \u2019 ve seen the videotape of the first 14 people who went into the building .\nThey were all dressed in black .\nThey look like they \u2019 d been trained as warriors , the people who went in .\nThis was clearly a planned event ; that was not the Trump supporters who were around the building .\nWhat my conclusion was on-site is that this was nothing short of a coup.\n\u201d Despite the initial elation experienced by many MAGA activists in the wake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u201c patriots \u201d who had carried it out , the right-wing narrative about the events of Jan. 6 eventually solidified once the reality of the situation began to set in .\nAs hundreds of Trump-loving activists began to face arrest and conviction stemming from their actions on that day and the disgrace the insurrection began to stain the MAGA movement , parts of Trump \u2019 s base and the former president himself collectively embraced the baseless belief that the entire thing had been a \u201c false flag \u201d orchestrated by left-wing groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been that even those who had initially celebrated the attack on the Capitol reversed course .\nJohn Guandolo , who initially praised the insurrectionists for showing remarkable \u201c restraint \u201d by not summarily executing the \u201c traitors \u201d in Congress , now claims that he was outside the Capitol during the events on Jan. 6 and saw \u201c several busloads \u201d of \u201c antifa people and non-patriot hostiles \u201d mixing with the crowd and entering the Capitol .\n\u201c It makes you wonder what is actually going on , \u201d Guandolo said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ on .\nWhat happened on Jan. 6 was the surrender of the republic and the takeover of the republic.\n\u201d Likewise , DeAnna Lorraine , who was on the ground at the Capitol during the insurrection and initially declared that she could not have been prouder about what happened , completely changed her tune and began insisting that the insurrection was a \u201c false flag \u201d operation set up to \u201c trap \u201d Trump supporters and provide justification for their persecution .\nLorraine eventually so thoroughly repudiated her initial support for the \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ultimately began spreading a conspiracy theory that police officers who had been in the Capitol that day\u2014several of whom have since died from suicide\u2014were being murdered by the \u201c deep state \u201d to cover up the truth about the events of Jan. 6 .\nA new NPR/Ipsos poll released Monday shows how deeply this narrative has burrowed its way into the public \u2019 s beliefs..\nAccording to the poll , nearly one-third of Republicans falsely say the attack on the Capitol was carried out by \u201c opponents of Donald Trump , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this entire narrative shift regarding the events of Jan. 6 raises the question of why MAGA and the GOP have been intractably opposed to the efforts by the House select committee to investigate the attack .\nAfter all , if Jan. 6 was nothing but a \u201c false flag \u201d operation carried out by left-wing operatives for the purpose of discrediting Trump and his supporters , wouldn \u2019 t Trump and his supporters want that truth to be exposed ?", "author": "Kyle Mantyla", "url":

down for a dinner with three others at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Pentagon City in Arlington , Virginia\u2014a short drive from Washington , D.C. , just across the Potomac River .\nThe date was Jan. 5 , 2021 .\nAmong those at his table was Eduardo Bolsonaro , a member of the National Congress of Brazil and eldest son of Brazil \u2019 s Trumpian president , Jair Bolsonaro .\nA new report from the nonprofit research organization Advance Democracy , Inc. , details Eduardo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D.C. , ahead of and following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol as he met with right-wing movement leaders and members of Trump \u2019 s inner circle .\nThough much of Bolsonaro \u2019 s movements have been reported in Brazilian media , Brazilian connections to Jan. 6 movement leaders have been largely overlooked in U.S. media .\nBut as Brazil \u2019 s own October 2022 national elections fast approach , Eduardo Bolsonaro \u2019 s meetings ahead of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol highlight the close relationship between figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States\u2014and a hunger to recreate former President Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign to hang on to power .\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro has already recreated some aspects of that campaign , sowing doubt in the electoral process and attacking branches of government that stand in his way\u2014in his case , the judiciary , which has opened investigations into potential crimes by his campaign against Brazil \u2019 s voting system .\nBetween his denialist handling of Brazil \u2019 s brutal experience of COVID-19 ( 620,000 deaths so far ) and its impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval rating drop as low as 19 percent , and he faces a likely campaign challenge from the immensely popular leftist former president , Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva , who left office in 2010 .\nBolsonaro has aligned himself with the police and military , parading military tanks through the capital in August as Congress considered a Bolsonaro-backed bill to overhaul the voting system , presumably to be more advantageous to his political fortunes .\nAhead of Brazil \u2019 s independence day celebration on Sept. 7 , Bolsonaro shared a private Whatsapp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support of a \u201c quite probable and necessary countercoup \u201d against the Brazilian judiciary and Congress , implying that the powers exercised by those institutions were somehow illegitimate .\n\u201c There \u2019 s absolutely an appetite for a Jan. 6-style insurrection if the election does not go Bolsonaro \u2019 s way\u2014which according to polls today , it will not go his way , \u201d Andre Pagliarini , an assistant professor of Brazilian history at Hampden Sydney College , told Right Wing Watch .\n\u201c According to polls today , he will lose resoundingly.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the far-right president \u2019 s eldest son appears to have gotten an inside glimpse of how far-right actors in the U.S. were able to stage their own attack on Congress\u2014or at the very least set the conditions for such an attack to occur .\nThe Bolsonaros have received the support of significant players in the U.S. right-wing movement since Jair Bolsonaro launched his presidential campaign in 2018 , with U.S. religious-right figures , including former Rep. Michelle Bachmann and Mario Bramnick offering their praise , and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon joining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEduardo Bolsonaro appears to be his father \u2019 s vessel for establishing ties with the American right , making trips to the U.S. to meet with the Trumps as well as Bannon , whom the younger Bolsonaro has said shares \u201c the same worldview.\n\u201d In 2019 , Eduardo Bolsonaro joined The Movement\u2014Bannon \u2019 s effort to elect far-right populist parties across the globe\u2014as the representative of South America .\nThat support continues to this day with Bannon keen , according to Pagliarini , on turning Brazil \u201c into the next MAGA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on Jan. 4 , Eduardo Bolsonaro met with then-presidential adviser and first daughter Ivanka Trump at the White House .\nBolsonaro \u2019 s wife billed the trip as last minute , yet claimed her husband had an \u201c official agenda.\n\u201d Meanwhile , the Brazilian embassy claimed to have been uninformed of the younger Bolsonaro \u2019 s agenda , telling Brazilian news outlet Publica that Brazil \u2019 s diplomats \u201c did not participate in its planning.\n\u201d However , a video posted on Twitter by journalist Raquel Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl shows the Brazilian congressman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with Nestor Forster , Brazil \u2019 s ambassador to the U.S. , entering the White House .\nA photo taken at the meeting emerged on Jan. 5 on Bolsonaro \u2019 s Instagram , showing Ivanka holding his infant daughter , flanked by Bolsonaro and his wife .\n\u201c Aunt Ivanka took her in her arms , \u201d Bolsonaro \u2019 s wife posted on social media , as reported by O Globo .\n\u201c It \u2019 s already the second official residence she knows.\n\u201d The next day , Eduardo continued his tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHe attended the aforementioned dinner with election conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell , California businessman Joseph Lam , and a third unidentified individual at the Ritz-Carlton .\nWhile Bolsonaro posted a photo of their meeting on Jan. 6 , social media posts unearthed by ADI show that the meeting in fact took place on Jan. 5 , suggesting that Lindell\u2014who , prior to dinner , had spoken at a so-called Stop the Steal rally where calls for violence were ubiquitous\u2014had thought it important to make time for Eduardo Bolsonaro .\nShortly after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lindell reportedly met with members of Trump \u2019 s inner circle and his close allies , including the then-president \u2019 s eldest son , Donald Trump Jr. and Trump Jr. \u2019 s girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle , Sen. Tommy Tuberville , Trump adviser Peter Navarro , and Trump \u2019 s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani at the Trump International Hotel in Washington .\nWhile there is no evidence that Bolsonaro joined Lindell at that later meeting , two other men with business ties to Brazil were in attendance : father and son Doyle and Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Inc. , an armored vehicle company that has ties to Jair Bolsonaro as well as the Brazilian military and police .\nLate in the evening on Jan. 5 , Daniel Beck offered a synopsis of the meeting in a Facebook post .\n\u201c We talked about the elections , illegal votes , court cases , the republics \u2019 status , what to expect on the hill tomorrow .\nTRUMP WILL RETAIN THE PRESIDENCY !\n!\n!\n\u201d he wrote .\nEduardo Bolsonaro remained mostly absent from his otherwise prolific social media presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with close Trump allies .\nThe day following the Capitol attack , according to his Facebook post , Eduardo Bolsonaro attended a meeting with Trump ally Matt Schlapp , chairman of the American Conservative Union ( which puts on the Conservative Political Action Conference ) , to arrange details for CPAC Brazil 2021 .\nFollowing his meeting with Schlapp , Eduardo Bolsonaro addressed the events of Jan. 6 , echoing a series of tweets by Brazilian Foreign Affairs Minister Ernesto Araujo .\n\u201c We must deplore and condemn the invasion , \u201d but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a democracy , the disrespect of the people by the institutions or those who control them , \u201d he tweeted .\nOn Jan. 8 , Bolsonaro met with Jared Kushner\u2014with Bolsonaro sharing a photo of the two of them on social media .\nEduardo Bolsonaro \u2019 s meetings with protagonists in the insurrection drama raise the question : What do the far-right in Brazil and the extreme right in the United States get out of this relationship ?\n\u201c F\u200b\u200brom the U.S. perspective , I think it \u2019 s more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trumps are not pariahs , that they have international connections , \u201d says Pagliarini , the assistant professor of history who has written widely on Brazilian politics .\n\u201c From the Brazilian perspective , I think it \u2019 s also about being able to show international validation \u2026 to show that they share a vision and agenda , a political project , with the then leader of the most powerful country in the world.\n\u201d Already Eduardo Bolsonaro \u2019 s connections in the United States have paid off .\nCPAC hosted its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Matt Schlapp and the younger Bolsonaro .\nThousands attended as Jair Bolsonaro baselessly warned that voter fraud could steal the 2022 presidential election ; Donald Trump Jr. was on hand to claim that China would meddle in the election .\nAt Mike Lindell \u2019 s \u201c cyber symposium \u201d rallies held in South Dakota in August 2021 , Eduardo Bolsonaro was introduced as a featured speaker by none other than Bannon , who claimed that the only way Jair Bolsonaro could lose the presidential election is if \u201c the machines \u201d steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting Bannon \u2019 s \u201c War Room \u201d podcast and is a regular

"The Jan. 6 Insurrection Should Have Been No Surprise, and Neither Should the Next Right-Wing Coup Attempt", "content": "While the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 , 2021 was shocking , it was not surprising to Right Wing Watch or other extremism researchers and watchdogs , who repeatedly sounded the alarm about calls from far-right figures for violence and revolution both before and after the 2020 presidential election .\nTwo weeks before Election Day , Right Wing Watch \u2019 s Kristen Doerer , reporting on the disrupted plot to kidnap Michigan Gov .\nGretchen Whitmer , noted : For example , televangelist Jim Baker warned in August 2020 that \u200bif Trump were not reelected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revolution.\n\u201d In September , \u200bRick Joyner repeated his warnings that the U.S. is headed for civil war , adding that God has \u201c seeded \u201d the country with Christian veterans who \u201c know how to fight in urban warfare \u201d and would help lead \u201c good militias.\n\u201d It was into that volatile situation that former President Donald Trump dropped the Big Lie that he won the election only to have it stolen from him and his supporters .\nThe Big Lie\u2014and the implication that President Joe Biden is illegitimate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated relentlessly by Trump , his legal team , Republican allies , right-wing media and movement leaders , and Christian nationalist religious figures .\nSome calls to overturn the results of the election , and some threats of violence to keep Trump in power , circulated in far-right corners of social media , while others were made in the full light of day from rally stages just blocks from the White House .\nAt a rally on the National Mall on Dec. 12 , 2020 , a wide array of right-wing Christian activists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extremist Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes , who demanded that Trump invoke emergency powers and martial law to stay in office\u200b and warned that if Trump did not , he would be leaving it to militias to fight a \u201c much more bloody war.\n\u201d \u200bAnother rally speaker , right-wing Orthodox Christian blogger George Michalopulos , declared , \u201c I would rather die on my feet than live on my knees.\n\u201d A week earlier , Michalopulos had admiringly reposted on his blog an online call for Trump to \u201c crush \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the Insurrection Act to arrest and/or kill everyone who participated \u201d in the \u201c plot \u201d to steal the election .\n\u200bAround the same time , former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Trumpist attorney Lin Wood called on Trump to declare martial law rather than concede to Biden .\nWood declared on Dec. 1 , 2020 that \u201c Our country is headed to civil war.\n\u201d That same day , an Ohio group with Tea Party roots had taken a full-page ad in the Washington Times that declared , \u201c Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with good reason , the threat of a shooting civil war is imminent.\n\u201d The ad urged Trump to declare martial law and have the military oversee a new election \u201c before there is no peaceful way left to preserve our Union.\n\u201d Shortly before the first attacks on the Capitol , Right Wing Watch published a report on the rally held by Trump supporters the previous afternoon and evening , noting that Stop the Steal organizer Ali Alexander led chants of \u201c Victory or death !\n\u201d and declared , \u201c 1776 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s friend and Stop the Steal colleague Alex Bruesewitz , a political consultant , declared , \u201c What \u2019 s going to start a civil war is if we legitimize a rigged and stolen election.\n\u201d At the same rally , InfoWars host Owen Shroyer rejoiced that members of Congress \u200bwere said to be \u201c in fear right now \u201d and \u201c scurrying around in secret tunnels \u201d like \u201c the little rats that they are \u201d to try to avoid the Stop the Steal activists .\nThat afternoon , Right Wing Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by widespread calls for violence on pro-Trump social media , \u201d which included a post calling for Vice President Mike Pence , Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , and Chief Justice John Roberts to be \u201c dispatched.\n\u201d In the days before the insurrection , \u200battorney Lin Wood\u200b had also called for Pence and others to be executed .\nThere is no doubt that the anger generated by Trump \u2019 s Big Lie fueled the violence on Jan. 6 , 2020 .\nBut it didn \u2019 t stop there .\nOn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop certification of Biden \u2019 s victory , hard-right activist John Guandolo appeared on a Christian television network and told viewers that the insurrectionists showed \u201c restraint \u201d by not executing \u201c traitors \u201d in Congress .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t see any other way out than a real armed counterrevolution to this hostile revolution that \u2019 s taking place , primarily driven by the communists , \u201d Guandolo said .\nSince then , Trump supporters \u2019 continued\u200b resentment about what many of them believe was an illegitimate election outcome has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify new voter suppression laws and the creation of provisions making it easier for state-level politicians to overrule election officials and the will of the voters .\nIt is also being manipulated by Trumpists like Cleta Mitchell and Steve Bannon to encourage \u201c America First \u201d activists to take power over election machinery by running for office at local and state levels .\nMitchell , a right-wing attorney who participated in the notorious phone call on which Trump badgered Georgia \u2019 s secretary of state to \u201c find \u201d enough votes to swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a massive right-wing political project to gain control over the counting of votes .\nLast year\u200b , she charged that Democrats \u201c cheated in the presidential election of 2020 and got away with it.\n\u201d Remarkably , thanks to the political machinations of another supporter of more restrictive voting laws , she simultaneously\u200b \u200bserves on the advisory board of a federal government commission to advise state election officials on voting guidelines and procedures .\n\u201c The risk of a coup in the next U.S. election is greater now than it ever was under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tribe wrote in The Guardian this week .\nTribe noted that shortly after the insurrection , \u201c Republicans abandoned their increasingly half-hearted search for accountability , and the leaders of their party began planning their next bite at the poisoned apple of power , an apple they told themselves had been stolen \u200bfrom them despite all evidence to the contrary.\n\u201d Indeed , most Republican leaders are aggressively trying to prevent accountability for Trump and others whose rhetoric\u2014at least\u2014inspired the insurrectionists .\nRight-wing leaders openly disparage the work of the House committee investigating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aides are brazenly subverting the investigation and the rule of law by refusing to respond to congressional subpoenas for their testimony .\nA new Atlantic Council report by resident fellow Jared Holt , formerly a Right Wing Watch investigative reporter , documents that domestic extremist movements have responded to \u200bpost-insurrection crackdowns \u200bby becoming more active in mainstream conservative politics ; decentralizing their operations and encouraging more local activism ; taking advantage of efforts by right-wing entrepreneurs to create alternative digital platforms ; and actively engaging in emotionally charged issues like vaccine and mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in U.S. history and institutions .\n\u200bNBC journalists Ben Collins and Brandy Zadrozny\u200b profiled this week a right-wing activist who exemplifies this shift to local organizing .\nDenise Aguilar was at the Capitol on Jan. 6 , celebrating that \u201c patriots broke open the doors \u201d and calling the day a \u201c revolution.\n\u201d Now she and fellow activists have focused on mobilizing local opposition to vaccine and mask requirements in schools\u200b , \u200b seemingly heeding Bannon \u2019 s call to \u200bhis\u200b right-wing listeners to\u200b \u201c take this back village by village.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide array of right-wing political groups has embraced campaigns to generate hostility toward local school boards as a way to mobilize voter turnout to take over school boards and build momentum for broader electoral wins in 2022 .\nThe Atlantic Council \u200b\u200band Right Wing Watch \u2019 s Kyle Mantyla also have reported that right-wing politicians and influencers have engaged in \u201c historical revisionism \u201d about the insurrection , \u200bplaying down the violence of the insurrection or baselessly blaming left-wing agitators .\nJust as the threat that violence would be used to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election was clear , the continuing threats to our democracy are ever more apparent\u2014and call for continued vigilance and resistance .\nThose threats come from continued right-wing promotion of Trump \u2019 s Big Lie and its wide acceptance among conservatives , threats and harassment directed at election officials , Republican opposition to truth-telling and accountability about the insurrection , and voter suppression laws and other schemes by GOP state legislators and activists to put control of election machinery in the hands of Trump\u200b loyalists .", "author": "Peter Montgomery",

Capitol steps , fighting with police , when the far-right leader of the Stop the Steal campaign , Ali Alexander , left the Capitol steps for the terrace of One America News Network \u2019 s building on Constitution Ave. Overlooking the Capitol , Alexander pointed to the Trump loyalists streaming across the Capitol grounds , past barricades and overrunning police , before turning to the camera .\n\u201c This is we the people , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Now , I want to say something .\nI don \u2019 t disavow this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c This is completely peaceful , looks like , so far , \u201d Alexander added , though he had seen the violence up close .\n\u201c And there are a couple of agitators that I obviously don \u2019 t endorse.\n\u201d In conclusion , he told his followers , \u201c StoptheSteal.us is going to be the home of the rebellion against an illegitimate government.\n\u201d This Right Wing Watch reporter captured that video , which was posted on the Stop the Steal Twitter account by Alexander \u2019 s associate Michael Coudrey at 4:26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , a year later , Alexander is claiming that the video is \u201c basically a deep fake , \u201d telling OAN \u2019 s John Himes on Dec. 13 that \u201c Twitter trolls \u201d targeted him , causing him to lose everything and setting up the House select committee investigating the attack on the Capitol to come after him .\nIn the \u201c exclusive \u201d OAN segment , Alexander was introduced as an organizer claiming to be targeted by the Jan. 6 committee \u201c simply because he \u2019 s a conservative.\n\u201d \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and denounce the violence and the agitators who were inside .\nI refuse to denounce the peaceful protesters that were outside , \u201d Alexander insisted .\n\u201c What they did is they chopped out the part that said I do not denounce this , and they clipped up that video and said Ali does not denounce the violence.\n\u201d \u201c And now , I \u2019 m being investigated by the select committee that says , \u2018 You refused to denounce this , you supported the violence , look where you said 1776 here.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I \u2019 m basically on trial for supporting America \u2019 s founding !\n\u201d Alexander protested .\nPresumably , Alexander or Coudrey has a copy of the original video they posted that day and could prove such claims by simply releasing it .\nThe fact that they haven \u2019 t done so is telling .\nAlexander may be frustrated by his own choice of words on OANN \u2019 s terrace on Jan. 6 because he got caught\u2014 \u201c rebellion , \u201d after all , isn \u2019 t peaceful\u2014but that doesn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander \u2019 s message on Jan. 6 is entirely in keeping with what he had been saying in the days and months leading up to the insurrection .\nAlexander launched the so-called Stop the Steal campaign just days after the 2020 presidential election as then-President Donald Trump began to slip in the vote counts ; both he and Jack Posobiec had floated the idea of rebooting the campaign earlier in the fall as reality began to set in among right-wing activists that Trump could well lose the presidency .\nAt the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative that the election was stolen from Trump .\nCalls for \u201c rebellion \u201d and \u201c revolution \u201d were ubiquitous at Stop the Steal rallies , as were attacks on election officials and Republicans who stood in the way .\nViolence broke out after two large rallies held in Washington , D.C. , in November and December , with the Proud Boys hate group roaming the streets looking to brawl with counterprotesters or antifascist activists , and Alexander telling the Proud Boys that he was \u201c Proud of my dudes.\n\u201d Alexander had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosting a Stop the Steal rally at Freedom Plaza , where threats of violence , Christian nationalism , and conspiracy theories mixed in a toxic brew on stage .\nThe message , Right Wing Watch \u2019 s Peter Montgomery reported at the time , was clear : Congress needs to reject Biden electors\u2014or else .\nAlexander took to the lectern .\n\u201c Victory or death !\nVictory or death !\n\u201d he shouted , as the crowd joined in .\n\u201c Our government is only our government if it is legitimate .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loses the consent of the people.\n\u201d \u201c I want them to know 1776 is always an option , \u201d Alexander said .\n\u201c Our government should be afraid.\n\u201d In the wee hours of Jan. 6 , Alexander took to Twitter to declare it the \u201c First official day of the rebellion.\n\u201d It wasn \u2019 t just talk .\nSupporters of Trump at the Capitol that day embraced the rhetoric and thought they were carrying out the second American Revolution .\n\u201c We \u2019 re walking down the same exact path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stewart Rhodes , founder of the right-wing extremist Oath Keepers group , who had spoken at one Stop the Steal rally and threatened a \u201c much more bloody war.\n\u201d Andrew Wrigley , 51 , from Philadelphia , waved a 1776 flag as he breached the Capitol .\nUnsurprisingly , the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack found the whole of Alexander \u2019 s words troubling and issued a subpoena for his testimony in October .\nAlexander testified in an 8-hour closed-door hearing on Dec. 9 .\nIn a draft of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the New York Times , he denied having anything to \u201c do with any violence or lawbreaking that happened on January 6 , \u201d claimed to have tried to deescalate the violence , and opted to throw Jan. 6 \u201c Save America \u201d rally organizers Amy Kremer , Kylie Kremer , and Katrina Pierson under the bus .\nAfter the hearing , he took to Telegram to complain that he faced \u201c 8 hours of accusations , lies , and conspiracy theories digging into my First Amendment rights.\n\u201d For now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the select committee .\nAlexander confirmed to congressional investigators that

of Trump \u2019 s inner circle .\nStill , his legal team launched a lawsuit against the panel and Verizon on Dec. 17 in an effort to prevent investigators from obtaining his phone records .\nAlexander

shared those concerns .\n\u201c Stew gets it , \u201d Witzke said .\n\u201c He gets the agenda.\n\u201d Peters , a failed rapper and former bounty hunter who now hosts an increasingly popular

is that America is real .\nIt \u2019 s not some melting pot or just some arbitrary borders with a random collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAmerica is a real nation with a real historic identity , founding

"Twitter and TikTok Still Have an Election Misinformation Problem", "content": "A year after social media platforms cracked down on election misinformation following the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 , false claims of electoral fraud are still prevalent on Twitter and TikTok .\nA new report conducted by Advance Democracy , Inc. , a nonpartisan nonprofit research organization , found that while explicit calls to violence on social media are not as prevalent as they were prior to Jan. 6 , 2021 , messages about the election being rigged or stolen still permeate .\nElection misinformation and disinformation flourished on social media ahead of the Capitol insurrection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activist Ali Alexander or QAnon celebrity Lin Wood peddling the Big Lie that the election was stolen from former President Donald Trump or calling for violence .\nRight-wing activists were able to mobilize followers for their so-called Stop the Steal campaign , bringing thousands of Trump supporters and conspiracy theorists to Washington , D.C. , to pressure Congress against certifying the election for President Joe Biden .\nThat disinformation campaign culminated in the Capitol insurrection .\nAfter the insurrection , Twitter finally took steps to limit election misinformation and the far-right QAnon conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its platform by mid-January , as well as the former president \u2019 s account .\nTikTok took some steps in the month leading up to the 2020 election and immediately after it , limiting searching abilities on its platform for some terms associated with QAnon and banning some hashtags related to election misinformation .\nBut election misinformation has persisted .\nIn the year since Jan. 6 , two hashtags associated with this type of misinformation\u2014 # electionfraud or # voterfraud\u2014were used in some 139,000 Twitter posts .\nThe top post came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Twitter after the release of ADI \u2019 s report .\nThe September tweet included the hashtags # ElectionFraud , # Dominion , and # ElectionIntegrity and a video of Hillary Clinton , which the account claimed was the former secretary of state explaining \u201c what their plan was \u201d to , presumably , steal the election .\nThat post got boosted by Jack Posobiec\u2014a far-right activist who supported the so-called Stop the Steal campaign and peddled the Big Lie that the 2020 election was stolen\u2014who retweeted @ AZCountryPatri1 with a simple \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followers .\nKelli Ward , chair of the Arizona GOP , was responsible for the third most popular election fraud post , tweeting in September , \u201c Start saying the words : # ElectionFraud & # Decertify .\nStop being fearful .\nSave this country.\n\u201d That garnered nearly 4,700 engagements .\nThe Texas attorney general , Ken Paxton , was behind another viral tweet alleging voter fraud in Texas .\nADI also gathered data on the hashtags # BidenCheated , which was used in 43,680 posts on Twitter ; # StolenElection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , used some 13,000 times .\nThose hashtags just give a sampling of the election misinformation still prevalent on Twitter ; presumably , many more tweets alleging voter fraud don \u2019 t include hashtags .\nOn TikTok , videos using two hashtags associated with false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump have received 14.7 million views .\nAs noted earlier , TikTok addressed misinformation on its platform by making certain terms harder to find , removing the searching capabilities for some hashtags associated with election misinformation .\nHashtags like # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and # voterfraud are no longer searchable on its platform , but users have created other hashtags to spread the lie that Trump won the 2020 election .\nThe ADI report looked specifically at the use of the hashtags # TrumpWon2020 and # ItsNotOverTrump2020 , which received 3.6 million views and 11.1 million views respectively .\n( After the release of ADI \u2019 s report , TikTok made the # TrumpWon2020 hashtag no longer searchable . )\nOne video on TikTok promoted election conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell \u2019 s \u201c documentary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and purported to display evidence of election fraud , along with the hashtags # ElectionInterference and # TrumpWon2020 .\nIt racked up nearly 9,000 views .\nAnother video posted this past August , which used the hashtag # TrumpWon2020 , # wethepeoplearepissed , and # standup , featured an audio recording of Trump saying , \u201c If you fuck around with us , if you do something bad to us , we are going to do things to you that have never been done before.\n\u201d The video featured text that read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STAND !\n\u201d Below that was an image of a bald eagle giving the middle finger and the caption \u201c Jihad this !\n\u201d while a Trump supporter nodded in agreement to the audio of Trump .\nAs of January , this video had received more than 6,700 views and over 1,600 likes .\nBy cracking down on some accounts peddling disinformation and conspiracy theories , Twitter and TikTok have been able to somewhat limit the spread of election disinformation .\nQAnon-related accounts , for example , were responsible for 1 in 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts that often amplify election misinformation and conspiracies is a good first step .\nBut with the 2022 midterm elections approaching , the Republican Party set on making it harder to vote in the name of preventing phantom voter fraud , and right-wing activists launching attacks on local election officials , disinformation experts are concerned about social media platforms readiness to address new election disinformation before it culminates in another event like Jan. 6 .",

'\n\u201d \u201c In other words , if God \u2019 s gon na send us a revival , we \u2019 re gon na have to have Christian folks get involved [ in politics ] because when righteousness exalts a nation , God will bless it , \u201d Barton added .\n\u201c But you don \u2019 t have righteousness if you don \u2019 t have righteous rulers to create that righteousness in policy .\nSo it takes righteous people to elect righteous people .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get righteous policy that God can bless .\nAnd that \u2019 s what he understood .\nThat \u2019 s Revival Lecture 15 .\nHe said , \u2018 God will bless or curse this nation according to the course that Christians take in politics .

actually said : The church must take right ground in regard to politics .\nDo not suppose , now , that I am going to preach a political sermon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you join and get up a Christian party in politics .\nNo , I do not believe in that .\nBut the time has come that Christians must vote for honest men , and take consistent ground in politics , or the Lord will curse them .\nThey must be honest men themselves , and instead of voting for a man because he belongs to their party , Bank or Anti-Bank , Jackson , or Anti-Jackson , they must find out whether he is honest and upright , and fit to be trusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the church will uphold no man in office , who is known to be a knave , or an adulterer , or a Sabbath-breaker , or a gambler , or a drunkard .\nSuch is the spread of intelligence and the facility of communication in our country , that every man can know for whom he gives his vote .\nAnd if he will give his vote only for honest men , the country will be obliged to have upright rulers .\nAll parties will be compelled to put up honest men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty in this matter .\nBut the time has come when they must act differently , or God will curse the nation , and withdraw his spirit .\nAs on the subject of slavery and temperance , so on this subject , the church must act right or the country will be ruined .\nGod can not sustain this free and blessed country , which we love and pray for , unless the church will take right ground .\nPolitics are a part of religion in such a country as this , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country as a part of their duty to God .\nIt seems sometimes as if the foundations of the nation were becoming rotten , and Christians seem to act as if they thought God did not see what they do in politics .\nBut I tell you , he does see it , and he will bless or curse this nation , according to the course they take .\nFinney explicitly said that he was not advocating that Christians \u201c join and get up a Christian party in

"While just about the entire right-wing movement in the United States has bought into the Big Lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump , few groups are as personally committed to promoting the false narrative as the various self-proclaimed \u201c prophets \u201d who emerged during Trump \u2019 s term in the White House .\nFrom the moment Trump became the Republican nominee in 2016 , religious-right activists rushed to declare that Trump had been personally chosen by God to save the country .\nA group of MAGA \u201c prophets \u201d rose up during Trump \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online and real world followings by issuing a steady stream of prophetic declarations guaranteeing that Trump would be reelected to a second term .\nHaving allegedly heard directly from God that Trump \u2019 s second term was assured , these \u201c prophets \u201d were predictably dismayed when Joe Biden won the election and was inaugurated as president on Jan. 20 , 2021 .\nNot only had their preferred political candidate lost , but their standing as \u201c prophets \u201d was in jeopardy As such , these \u201c prophets \u201d spent the last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election and vehemently insisting that they are not , in fact , false prophets .\nJust take , for instance , the \u201c prophetess \u201d Kat Kerr who claimed in 2018 that she had been taken to Heaven where God showed her the results of the next five elections , which she said would result in \u201c 24 years of God in the White House \u201d beginning with Trump winning reelection in 2020 .\nHis term , in Kerr \u2019 s telling , would be followed by Vice President Mike Pence being elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the election of whomever Pence has chosen as his vice president .\nNeedless to say , with the fact that Trump has not been in the White House for the last year and has turned against Pence for failing to stop the confirmation of Biden \u2019 s electoral win , it is now literally impossible for Kerr \u2019 s prophecies to come true .\nBut that hasn \u2019 t chastened Kerr in the least , as she has spent the last year resolutely spreading false claims about a stolen election and insisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kerr , QAnon conspiracy theorist and self-proclaimed \u201c prophet \u201d Johnny Enlow also prophesied that Trump would win reelection and has correspondingly spent the last year refusing to admit that he was wrong and insisting instead that Trump has secretly become \u201c President of the World.\n\u201d Self-proclaimed \u201c prophet \u201d Robin Bullock has spent the last year refusing to admit that his prophecies about the election were wrong and spreading the Big Lie about the election , repeatedly asserting that Biden is not legitimately president , and warning that anyone who dares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be driven insane by God .\n\u201c Prophet \u201d Jeff Jansen made the cardinal mistake of actually declaring that the fraud would be exposed , that the election would be overturned , and that Trump restored to office by a specific date .\nDeclaring that the U.S. was secretly under martial law , Jansen proclaimed that the military would remove Biden from office and reinstate Trump by the end of June .\nEven after June came and went and Biden remained in the White House , Jansen nevertheless continued to insist that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he \u2019 s gon na step back in.\n\u201d Nathan French , another self-proclaimed \u201c prophet , \u201d asserted that God would restore Trump to office in order to silence those who were mocking the prophetic community over their false election prophecies .\nFrench proclaimed that Trump would be back in office by April , and even though that didn \u2019 t happen , French insists that his prophecies were correct because \u201c in the heavens , in the spirit realm , [ Trump is ] actually still considered the president.\n\u201d Few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about being wrong as Hank Kunneman .\nHaving repeatedly declared that Trump would be reelected and even that Pence would be elected in 2024 , Kunneman has dedicated countless Sunday sermons and media appearances to spreading the Big Lie and refusing to repent for his false prophecies .\nIn fact , Kunneman has gone so far as to say that questioning his false prophecies or acknowledging Biden \u2019 s win are \u201c grievous to God.\n\u201d Those who stand by Kunneman , he has proclaimed , will be rewarded by God , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not : God hates you .\nWith Biden having been in the White House for one year now , most of the MAGA movement has gone all in on the Big Lie rather than admit that their preferred presidential candidate lost .\nAfter all , lying about the election provides justification for imposing new restrictions on voting and potentially motivates conservatives to turn out in 2022 and 2024 .\nBut to these self-proclaimed \u201c prophets , \u201d their commitment to the Big Lie is also deeply personal , as promoting it provides an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to claim that their reputations as influential religious leaders , political commentators , and oracles of God are intact .", "author": "Kyle Mantyla", "url":

said that the Southern Poverty Law Center had placed him on a list of \u201c thirty terrorists to be watched in America.\n\u201d As we pointed out at the time , the SPLC had simply included Barton in

Wade , the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling granting women the right to an abortion , which faces an existential threat this year from the Supreme Court \u2019 s conservative majority .\nJoining the students\u2014many of whom arrived in waves from Catholic high schools wearing matching beanies to be easily spotted by their chaperones\u2014were white nationalists , white supremacists , and Christian nationalists eager to celebrate a win for the right-wing movement .\nEarlier in the day , the court \u2019 s conservative justices signaled their disdain for abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providers to have a federal judge promptly address a Texas law that bans abortion at 6 weeks and deputizes private citizens to enforce it by allowing them to sue for up to $ 10,000 .\nLooming over the rally , and abortion rights writ large , was the reality that the Supreme Court was , in the coming months , set to rule on another abortion case : Dobbs v. Jackson Women \u2019 s Health Organization .\nAt the heart of that case is a Mississippi law that bans abortion at 15 weeks\u2014before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Roe , which recognizes that women have a constitutional right to an abortion in the first two trimesters of pregnancy , roughly 24 weeks .\nWhile the March for Life has always been an initiation to the anti-abortion rights movement for thousands of teenagers\u2014made \u201c fun \u201d with a concert featuring Christian musicians\u2014the righteous indignation of teenagers usually palpable at its rallies was replaced with a new celebratory atmosphere .\nCheers and chants broke out at the prospect of the end of Roe , and lawmakers , from Sen. Mitt Romney to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemnation of abortion rights .\nMeanwhile , Christian nationalism oozed into some speakers \u2019 anti-choice messaging calling for government control of women \u2019 s reproductive organs .\n\u201c Why are we here ?\nThe Bible , the book that built America , says that those who hate God love death , \u201d actor and conservative activist Kirk Cameron told the crowd .\nAmong the speakers was Kristen Waggoner who serves as general counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom , the religious-right legal giant responsible for Mississippi \u2019 s 15-week ban .\nIn 2018 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Denise Burke bragged at an anti-choice conference that the 15-week abortion ban was based on ADF \u2019 s model language and that the legislation was the next step in the group \u2019 s strategic plan to \u201c eradicate \u201d Roe v. Wade through the courts .\nIn her speech , Waggoner celebrated the Mississippi law .\n\u201c This year at long last the Dobbs case has exposed a half century of lies , bad science , and the devastating consequences Roe v. Wade has wreaked on women , children , and families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please pray .\nPray as you \u2019 ve never prayed before that the Supreme Court will have the moral courage to do what is right and to fully and finally reverse Roe v. Wade because the right to abortion has no basis in our Constitution.\n\u201d The prospect of a win even lured white supremacists to the march .\nMale members of Patriot Front marched down Constitution Ave ahead of the official march start , displaying a sign that read \u201c STRONG FAMILIES MAKE STRONG NATIONS \u201d with eugenic fervor .\n( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s white supremacist ideology . )\nA handful of young male activists with the white nationalist America First youth movement ( led by Nick Fuentes ) watched from the sidewalk and couldn \u2019 t decide whether the Patriot Front group was made up of neo-Nazis or federal agents .\nEither way , they weren \u2019 t very impressed with the group \u2019 s police escort .\n\u201c Their platform is unintelligible , \u201d one activist added .\nThey moved further down the block , holding their America First flags high in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court .\n\u201c Christ is King !\nChrist is King !\n\u201d chants broke out among activists with the New Columbia Movement , a Christian nationalist group seemingly made up of only men who stand against any sort of contraception , premarital sex , daycare , and secularism and believe mothers ought to be \u201c stay-at-home moms.\n\u201d The group \u2019 s co-founder , Nicholas Chimera Jr. , was recently in \u201c the Mussolini-fan club \u201d American Black Shirts Party , according to former U.S. Army Sergeant and Sparverius CEO Kristofer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year that the mostly Catholic group was a \u201c traditional Christian movement \u201d ; Goldsmith describes the group as Christofascist\u2014representing the intersection of Christian nationalism and fascism .\n\u201c Faith .\nFamily .\nFraternity , \u201d the group \u2019 s banner read .\nAnother sign proclaimed , \u201c Contraception degrades and perverts the nature of love and intimacy.\n\u201d A few of the men dressed in flat caps , embracing their backward views with old timey ensembles .\nAs they marched down Constitution Ave , the America First activists took up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined forces with the New Columbia Movement .\nWhile the March for Life has brought thousands of teenagers into the anti-abortion rights movement over its 49 years in existence , this year \u2019 s march exposed students to the broad array of forces on the right keen to rollback women \u2019 s rights and which are on the brink of a win .", "author": "Kristen Doerer", "url":

Domestic Relations District Court in Richmond , Virginia .\nThe 36-year-old Richmond resident walked out having been convicted of disseminating images of another in a case of \u201c revenge porn \u201d against Faith Vickers , the mother of his child and his ex-girlfriend , who was 18 at the time of the crime .\nCourt records from the Jan. 5 plea that were provided to Right Wing Watch show that Ralph pleaded \u201c nolo contendere , \u201d thus accepting conviction without admitting guilt .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward Lambert sentenced Ralph to 12 months and suspended the sentence , meaning Ralph will not go to jail so long as he maintains \u201c good behavior.\n\u201d Ralph hosts \u201c Killstream , \u201d a podcast that has welcomed a host of extremists , from failed neo-Nazi \u200bcongressional candidate Patrick Little to white supremacist Lana Lokteff .\nHe was a leader in the misogynist 2014 Gamergate campaign , which harassed and doxxed female developers .\nMore recently , he \u2019 s defended white nationalist Nick Fuentes and invited white supremacist Richard Spencer on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend the two days prior to his plea hosting a 24-hour \u201c Free Ralph Festival \u201d featuring far-right internet figures , but the fundraiser for his legal fees was stymied in part by a snowstorm .\nThe promotional image for the event , which Ralph shared on Twitter , featured a debate between Styx Hexenhammer , n\u00e9e Tarl Warwick , who regularly espouses nationalistic views to his nearly 500,000 subscribers on YouTube , and Paul Ray Ramsey , a misogynist white nationalist .\nOthers set to appear in support of Ralph included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , founder of a conspiracist website known for peddling antisemitic conspiracy theories .\nOver the years , Ralph \u2019 s podcast and internet persona have showcased his blend of extremist views and abusive behavior , most notably on Aug. 11 , 2020 .\nIn the early hours of that day , while Vickers , then his girlfriend , was in the hospital , Ralph released a video of the two of them having sex on another individual \u2019 s livestream .\nHe told Vickers that he had been hacked .\nRalph was arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Vickers had left Ralph in Richmond and moved across the country .\nHe was released on his own recognizance in lieu of bail the same day .\nIn February 2021 , the prosecution tabled its case against Ralph via \u201c nolle prosequi.\n\u201d While Ralph celebrated the prosecution \u2019 s decision and falsely claimed he was \u201c exonerated , \u201d Assistant Commonwealth \u2019 s Attorney Kelli Burnett told Right Wing Watch at the time that \u201c nolle prosequi \u201d \u201c is not the same thing as not guilty.\n\u201d While \u201c nolle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prosecution reinstated its case against Ralph in August , following Vickers \u2019 request to pursue the case again .\nBy that time , Vickers had been granted a domestic violence temporary restraining order against Ralph for her son and herself , a restraining order that Ralph has been charged with violating twice , according to court documents .\nThe 12-month suspended sentence handed down to Ralph by Judge Lambert means Ralph will not serve his 12 months in jail as long as he maintains \u201c good behavior , \u201d including \u201c keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying fines and costs.\n\u201d As such , Ralph will essentially be on unsupervised probation for the next year and could potentially head to jail for up to a year for any infraction .\nThe conviction is not his first ; back in 2018 , Ralph spent eight months in jail for resisting arrest and attacking a police officer who , Ralph has seemed keen to note , is Latino .\nRalph left the courthouse on Jan. 5 declaring , at least publicly , victory .\nRecording an unsteady video from the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrated , screaming and singing along to Drake \u2019 s \u201c God \u2019 s Plan.\n\u201d Twenty minutes later , he posted to Twitter a photo of himself at Richmond \u2019 s Jefferson Hotel with his girlfriend , flashing the OK hand symbol , which has been appropriated by some extremists as a sign for white power , captioning the photo , \u201c It \u2019 s a 5-star kinda day !\n\u201d \u201c I also have no probation or anyone to report to .\nAnd I didn \u2019 t plea guilty to anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveniently focusing on his plea rather than his conviction .\nRight Wing Watch reached out to Ralph via Twitter Sunday for comment .\nWe will update this story should he respond .\nFor Vickers , who now lives in California , the conviction brings relief .\nThe case is over , and she won \u2019 t have to come back to Virginia to testify .\n\u201c All I really wanted was the conviction , \u201d she said .\nShe sat in the courtroom as the court found him guilty and began sentencing .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ thot , he could say I was a whore , but he couldn \u2019 t even look me in the eyes after the judge had said he was guilty of what he did to me , after so many months of pleading he was innocent and that he wasn \u2019 t going to face anything and that he was the one who won in the end , \u201d Vickers said .\n\u201c I came all the way out there to make sure that some sort of justice was found.\n\u201d The Jan. 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s legal troubles .\nRalph is set to be arraigned on Jan. 24 on two

dragging U.S.-style culture wars into the very different world of Brazilian politics and media landscape.\n\u201d Whether Bolsonaro \u2019 s social media slam on the moderation of misinformation in the name of fighting \u201c Big Tech censorship \u201d works in his favor will become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in October .\nBolsonaro has himself spread misinformation about COVID-19 .\nThe so-called \u201c Trump of the Tropics \u201d has also suggested that the only way he could lose the upcoming presidential election is if the vote is rigged , and he has aligned himself closely with the police and military\u2014all while signaling a need for a \u201c quite probable and necessary countercoup \u201d should he lose .\nTrump has endorsed Bolsonaro \u2019 s reelection bid .\nBolsonaro became an ally to the Trump administration as soon as he assumed office in 2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolsonaro , frequently traveled to the U.S. to engage with members of Donald Trump \u2019 s inner circle .\nThe younger Bolsonaro even traveled to Washington , D.C. , ahead of the Jan. 6 insurrection to meet with figures like Mike Lindell and Jared Kushner , as detailed in a recent report by the nonprofit research organization Advance Democracy , Inc .\nThere are other parallels between the politics of Trump and Bolsonaro .\nLike Trump , Bolsonaro had the support of MAGA strategist Steve Bannon and U.S. Christian right leaders during his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like their conservative counterparts in the U.S. , right-wing politicians in Brazil have made \u201c tech censorship \u201d a campaign issue .\nDuring Brazil \u2019 s 2018 presidential campaign , disinformation flooded WhatsApp\u2014used by about 120 million Brazilians at the time\u2014with the vast majority of false information favoring Bolsonaro .\n( If it sounds a bit like Facebook \u2019 s role in the 2016 U.S. election , may we remind you that WhatsApp \u2019 s parent company is , you guessed it , Facebook . )\nIn October , Brazil \u2019 s Superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry into accusations that the 2018 Bolsonaro campaign coordinated disinformation on WhatsApp , acquitted Bolsonaro for lack of evidence .\nBut a member of the country \u2019 s Federal Supreme Court reiterated its message that \u201c if there is a repetition of what was done in 2018 , [ politicians \u2019 ] registrations will be revoked , and those who do so will go to jail for attacking Brazil \u2019 s elections and democracy.\n\u201d Meanwhile , the country \u2019 s Supreme Electoral Court is considering banning Telegram , another source of disinformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSuch measures to prevent the spread of misinformation in Brazil does not bode well for Bolsonaro .\nThat may explain why in September , the far-right president moved to temporarily ban social media companies from taking down certain posts , including claims that the only way Bolsonaro will lose in October is by voter fraud .\nHere \u2019 s where the Rogan controversy comes into play .\n\u201c Making an issue of the Rogan thing can be seen as a preemptive move to invoke tech censorship throughout Bolsonaro \u2019 s presidential campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFor years , Rogan\u2014who is also a UFC commentator\u2014has invited MMA fighters , fringe health experts , far-right figures , and conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones onto his Spotify-exclusive podcast , \u201c The Joe Rogan Experience , \u201d with an estimated 11 million listeners per episode .\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic , his podcast has spread misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines , prompting 270 health experts to call on Spotify in January to moderate misinformation .\nThe calls for moderation have grown .\nLast week , musicians Neil Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their music from the platform as long as Rogan \u2019 s podcast remained .\nBy inserting himself into the conversation , Bolsonaro can also highlight his popularity among MMA celebrities\u2014another thing he happens to have in common with Trump\u2014and encourage them to further spread his message of tech censorship .\nMMA is the second or third most popular sport in the Brazil , and Jair Bolsonaro has basked in the endorsements of MMA fighters like Darren Till who , as my former colleague Karim Zidan reported for Bloody Elbow , used his speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell viewers , \u201c Lula in jail and Bolsonaro 2018 !\n\u201d ( Lula is a reference to former leftist Brazilian president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva . )\nZidan highlighted the dozens of fighters who have offered their support to Bolsonaro\u2014many of whom are friendly with Rogan\u2014including Brazilians Wanderlei Silva , Anderson Silva , Royce Gracie , and Renzo Gracie , who have between hundreds of thousands of followers to millions of followers each on social media .\nEven with disinformation , the religious right , and MMA celebrities on Bolsonaro \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face an uphill battle to reelection .\nBolsonaro \u2019 s handling of the pandemic , which has led to 629,000 deaths and counting , and its effects on the economy don \u2019 t bode well in the race against the popular former leftist Brazilian president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva .\nPolls show if the election were held today , Lula could win by as many as 11 percentage points .", "author": "Kristen Doerer", "url":

he has gone through an \u201c unbelievable nightmare \u201d at the hands of the government since joining the sea of Trump loyalists trying to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 , 2021 .\nHe then vowed to \u201c take down the Democratic Party.\n\u201d A self-proclaimed \u201c former liberal , \u201d Straka founded Walk Away , a campaign encouraging people to leave the Democratic Party for the Republican Party , and he became an early organizer with the so-called Stop the Steal campaign .\nThis fall , he pleaded guilty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in disorderly and disruptive conduct on the U.S. Capitol grounds on Jan. 6 and that he \u201c did so with the intent to impeded , disrupt , or disrupt \u201d a session of Congress\u2014in this case , to disrupt the congressional certification of Joe Biden \u2019 s victory in the presidential election .\nOn Jan. 24 , District Judge Dabney Friedrich , a Trump appointee in Washington , D.C. , sentenced Straka to three years of probation , three months of house arrest , 60 hours of community service , a fine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500 fine for the damage done to the Capitol building by insurrectionists .\nShe said she found it \u201c deeply troubling \u201d that Straka used his large social media presence to defend what happened on Jan. 6 .\nStraka spoke to Levin on the Feb. 1 episode of \u201c The Mark Levin Show , \u201d presenting what he said was his first time publicly sharing his story of what happened that day .\nHe claimed he now suffers from \u201c PTSD \u201d caused by his arrest and detainment and bristled at being treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an early organizer with the so-called Stop the Steal campaign .\nThe day following the campaign \u2019 s first rally in Washington , D.C. , on Nov. 14 , Straka held a Walk Away rally in the city featuring Stop the Steal leader Ali Alexander and Drew Hernandez , the latter of whom spoke of \u201c civil war \u201d and celebrated the violence of the Proud Boys hate group .\nOn Jan. 5 , Straka joined far-right operatives and conspiracy theorists like Ali Alexander and Alex Jones at a Stop the Steal rally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence were ubiquitous .\nStraka told Levin his speech that evening was \u201c very fiery , which I thought at the time was still legally permitted in the United States.\n\u201d \u201c Patriots !\nWelcome to the revolution !\n\u201d He shouted to the crowd that evening .\n\u201c This is a revolution .\nWe are part of a revolution .\n\u2026 It has taken this long to losing Donald Trump to wake up the beast in the American people.\n\u201d Straka was also scheduled to speak on Jan. 6 at the \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Stop the Steal campaign at the Capitol .\nAs he headed toward the Capitol to give his speech , he was informed that the Capitol had been breached , but he told Levin he had not understood what that meant .\nHe arrived at the Capitol on the east side and took an 8-minute-long video of himself and other Trump loyalists trying force their way into the Capitol .\nStraka claims he had his hands above his head as he was recording the video with his phone\u2014the suggestion being that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the screen .\nHe also claimed to have not seen any violence .\nBut in one scene , Straka is heard telling the mob to \u201c go , go , go \u201d as they reached the Capitol , trying to force their way inside .\nIn another , rioters were wrestling a shield away from a U.S. Capitol Police officer , and Straka yells , \u201c take it , take it !\n\u201d His posts on Twitter from Jan. 6 , which were included in prosecutors \u2019 complaint , echoed his instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start a real revolution to , in his words , \u201c take our government back from lying , cheating globally interested swamp parasites.\n\u201d \u201c Patriots at the Capitol \u2013 HOLD .\nTHE .\nLINE !\n!\n!\n!\n\u201d he tweeted .\nIn another , he admitted to trying to storm the Capitol : \u201c I arrived at the Capitol a few hours ago as Patriots were storming from all sides .\nI was quite close to entering myself as police began tear gassing us from the door .\nI inhaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes .\nPatriots began exiting shortly after saying Congress had been cleared.\n\u201d As Republican leaders and right-wing commentators began baselessly claiming that anti-fascist activists were to blame in the evening of Jan. 6 , Straka held his ground in cheering on the insurrectionists in a series of tweets : \u2022 \u201c I \u2019 m completely confused .\nFor 6-8 weeks everybody on the right has been saying \u2018 1776 !\n\u2019 & that if congress moves forward it will mean a revolution !\nSo congress moves forward .\nPatriots storm the Capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassment that this happened.\n\u201d \u2022 \u201c Also- be embarrassed & hide if you need to- but I was there .\nIt was not Antifa at the Capitol .\nIt was freedom loving Patriots who were DESPERATE to fight for the final hope of our Republic because literally nobody cares about them .\nEveryone else can denounce them .\nI will not.\n\u201d \u2022 \u201c Perhaps I missed the part where it was agreed this would be a revolution of ice cream cones & hair-braiding parties to take our government back from lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My bad.\n\u201d Despite calling for a revolution and encouraging violence , Straka recalled being shocked when the FBI presented him with a search warrant and put him in handcuffs .\n\u201c For me , this is really where the source of the PTSD began because within a moment , I lost my identity as a human being , I stopped being Brandon Straka , let alone Brandon Straka the Walk Away campaign guy , and I was wearing an orange jumpsuit and sitting in jail , \u201d Straka told Levin , echoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jail , suddenly became prison reformers .\n\u201c During those two days , I sat in that cell literally just breaking down emotionally because I thought myself , this is now Jan. 25 , 2021 , so Joe Biden became president five days before I got arrested , the Democrats have now taken full control of the federal government , I \u2019 m Brandon Straka the Walk Away from the Democrats founder , and now I \u2019 m sitting in a concrete cell , \u201d he continued , becoming increasingly emotional .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ are facing nonviolent low-level misdemeanor charges who are being treated like terrorists , like insurrectionists in this country .\nI actually fall into this category\u2014the government has actually put me on a terrorism watch list.\n\u201d \u201c We have completely allowed the left to take complete control of this narrative , \u201d he added , ignoring MAGA world \u2019 s efforts to blame the insurrection on left-wing agitators and defend the attack as legitimate political discourse .\nStraka ended his interview with a plea for funding and a pledge to get back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walk Away is going to comeback bigger and better than ever , and we \u2019 re going to take down the Democratic Party , \u201d Straka vowed .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to take all of these people down .\n\u201d", "author": "Kristen Doerer", "url":

American History", "content": "Christian nationalist pseudo-historian David Barton spoke at the Village Church in Blythewood , South Carolina , Tuesday as part of the Faith Wins \u201c American Restoration Tour , \u201d which aims to mobilize conservative Christian voters heading into the 2022 midterm elections .\nDuring his presentation , Barton falsely claimed that the early American government imposed no taxes on American citizens because the Founding Fathers knew that such taxes were unbiblical .\n\u201c Do you know that God talks about what we call the capital gains tax ?\n\u201d Barton said .\n\u201c The Bible also talks about things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt talks about progressive taxes , it talks about flat taxes , it talks about capitation taxes .\nThe Bible has so much on economics.\n\u201d \u201c It \u2019 s interesting , \u201d he continued .\n\u201c Even as Jesus and Peter were talking and Jesus said , \u2018 Peter , tell me : who pays taxes ?\nThe children or the foreigners ?\n\u2019 Peter said , \u2018 That \u2019 s easy .\nThe children don \u2019 t pay taxes , it \u2019 s the foreigners that pay taxes.\n\u2019 See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , you didn \u2019 t tax the citizens .\nThere was no direct taxes .\nWe had to alter the Constitution to be able to tax you directly because we had all the taxes on the foreigners .\nWe had all the tariffs and all the different ways of taxing the things that came from outside , not the inside .\nWell , that was a tax piece of policy out of the Bible.\n\u201d The reference to the conversation between Jesus and Peter is a claim of Barton \u2019 s that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter were discussing paying the \u201c temple tax \u201d and Jesus argued that just as the \u201c kings of the earth \u201d do not levy taxes on their own children , neither should the children of God have to pay a tax in order to enter His temple .\nNevertheless , Jesus instructed Peter to pay the tax for the both of them .\nJesus was most certainly not asserting , as Barton claims , that governments should not tax their citizens , nor does Barton provide any evidence that the founders cited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to levy an income tax .\nAs for Barton \u2019 s claim that \u201c in early America , you didn \u2019 t tax the citizens , \u201d that is likewise false as demonstrated by \u201c The Whiskey Rebellion \u201d of 1791 , which arose when farmers in Western Pennsylvania violently objected to legislation passed by the very first Congress that imposed a tax on domestically produced distilled spirits in an effort to raise money to pay off the debt accumulated during the Revolutionary War .\nAs the Treasury Department \u2019 s Alcohol and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As part of the compromises that led to the adoption of the United States Constitution in 1789 , the new Federal government agreed to assume the Revolutionary War debts of the 13 States .\nIn early 1791 , to help pay off the resulting national debt , Congress used its new constitutional authority to \u201c lay and collect Taxes , Duties , Imposts and Excises \u201d and passed the first nationwide internal revenue tax\u2014an excise tax on distilled spirits .\nCongress took this action at the urging of the first Secretary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid on goods imported into the United States , the excise tax on distilled spirits was a direct tax on Americans who produced whiskey and other alcohol spirits .\nThe 1791 excise law set a varying six to 18-cent per gallon tax rate , with smaller distillers often paying more than twice per gallon what larger producers paid .\nAll payments had to be made in cash to the Federal revenue officer appointed for the distiller \u2019 s county .\nLarge , commercial distillers in the eastern United States generally accepted the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost onto their cash-paying customers .\nHowever , most smaller producers west of the Appalachian and Allegheny Mountains , then the Nation \u2019 s frontier , opposed the \u201c whiskey tax.\n\u201d Not only is Barton \u2019 s interpretation of this particular Bible passage wrong , but so is his attempt to use that passage to misrepresent American history .",

Abbott\u2019s Anti-Trans Directive", "content": "Texas Gov .\nGreg Abbott last week directed the state \u2019 s Department of Family Protective Services to investigate gender-affirming health care as \u201c child abuse \u201d and the parents of children who receive such care as perpetrating it .\nThe directive , which was met with alarm by LGBTQ groups , was applauded by Terry Schilling of the American Principles Project , who took credit for Abbott \u2019 s directive on Steve Bannon \u2019 s \u201c War Room \u201d podcast last Thursday and thanked the War Room for aiding its pressure campaign on Abbott .\n\u201c We put together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the War Room support , and we put pressure on him right before the election , \u201d Schilling said .\n\u201c It wasn \u2019 t a coincidence that he did this .\nAnd Abbott basically instructed all of his state agencies to treat this as child abuse , and it \u2019 s now criminal to do this.\n\u201d Abbott , a champion of the conservative movement , has been accused of not being right wing enough by the Republican Party \u2019 s extreme fringes .\nSuch attacks escalated ahead of Tuesday \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won .\nIn Schilling \u2019 s telling , Abbott has been insufficiently harsh on the LGBTQ community .\nUnder Schilling \u2019 s leadership , APP\u2014a religious-right organization that has made discriminating against trans kids its main endeavor\u2014launched a Texas state chapter last year and targeted Abbott and other Republicans for not going far enough with the anti-trans legislation they passed .\nIn February , APP released two ads attacking Abbott for failing to \u201c protect our children.\n\u201d \u201c Gov .\nGreg Abbott promised to protect our children from dangerous sex-change procedures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one ad released Feb. 4 .\n\u201c Given the opportunity to protect Texas children , Greg Abbott chose not to bring up legislation.\n\u201d The legislation in question was an extreme bill from the Texas state legislature that would have criminalized gender-affirming health care for youth , redefining \u201c child abuse \u201d to include puberty suppression drugs , hormone replacement therapy , or surgical or medical procedures \u201c for gender transitioning purposes.\n\u201d ( It \u2019 s worth noting that trans youth rarely , if ever , undergo surgery , and medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trans youth time to better understand their identity , are reversible . )\nOn Bannon \u2019 s podcast , Schilling accused Abbott of using \u201c all of these backroom legislative maneuvers to keep it from getting a vote.\n\u201d However , when the state legislature did not pass that bill , Abbott asked his attorney general , Ken Paxton , to determine whether such gender-affirming health care could be considered \u201c child abuse \u201d under current Texas state law .\nPaxton issued an opinion on Feb. 18 that such care constitutes as \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abbott issued the directive to investigate gender-affirming care as \u201c child abuse.\n\u201d The order also called on teachers , doctors , and other professionals to report to child and protection services parents who provide their kids gender-affirming care , adding that there would be consequences for those who don \u2019 t report .\nSchilling called the directive a \u201c victory for the War Room posse , \u201d and he applauded Paxton , who was a guest earlier in the program , for his opinion .\n\u201c It doesn \u2019 t happen without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen without Ken Paxton and his leadership and what he came out with ; and it also doesn \u2019 t happen without the War Room posse and everything they \u2019 re doing to help us really make this pro-family movement more muscular , \u201d Schilling said .\nBannon , however , remained dissatisfied with Abbott \u2019 s directive .\n\u201c You got ta get the law passed , \u201d he said .\n\u201c What does the cadre need to do to have your back and the folks down in Texas to get this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d \u201c So the first thing we have to do is we have to help Gov .\nAbbott and AG Paxton enforce the law , \u201d Schilling said .\n\u201c And what I mean by that is we have to start making reports when we find out about something bad happening to kids when it comes to gender transition .\nI don \u2019 t care if it \u2019 s top surgery where they \u2019 re doing mastectomy to healthy young girls or even just the counseling .\nWe have to start making reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys can \u2019 t enforce the law and criminalize bad guys if they don \u2019 t know when and where and who is doing it.\n\u201d \u201c Number two is you have to hold your politicians accountable , and you have to demand that they pass this , \u201d Schilling said .\n\u201c Abbott actually could call a special session in order to pass this legislation .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve got to force this , \u201d Bannon said , urging his listeners to call on Abbott to call for a special session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that Bannon and Schilling have teamed up to attack trans youth .\nSchilling \u2019 s group , APP , is also a member of A Promise to America \u2019 s Children , a coalition of right-wing and religious-right groups that formed last year to oppose so-called \u201c gender ideology.\n\u201d In reality , the coalition targeted trans youth through model legislation and misinformation .\nPulling a page from religious-right attacks on gay men , these groups have fearmongered about trans people , claiming they need to \u201c protect kids.\n\u201d Instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth .\nThe Trevor Project , a suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ youth , saw a 150 percent increase in crisis calls and messages in Texas between 2020 and 2021 when the state considered dozens of anti-LGBTQ bills .\nThe group condemned Abbott \u2019 s directive , stating , \u201c Access to gender-affirming medical care , like gender-affirming hormone therapy ( GAHT ) , has been found to be significantly linked to lower rates of depression , suicidal thoughts , and suicide attempts among transgender and nonbinary youth.\n\u201d Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Child and Adolescent Psychiatry , American Academy of Pediatrics , and American Medical Association , also support gender-affirming medical treatment .\nAlthough LGBTQ groups say Abbott \u2019 s directive is unlikely to hold up in court , many see the directive as a political move made before both Paxton and Abbott \u2019 s primary elections .\nSpeaking about the legislative attacks on trans youth last spring , LGBTQ writer and author Charlotte Clymer told Right Wing Watch , \u201c For about a decade now , Republicans , specifically social conservatives , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for elections .\n\u201d", "author":

Marjorie Taylor Greene .\nFuentes and his self-described army of \u201c Groypers \u201d defended Greene\u2014who spoke at AFPAC and whose initials they chanted during her speech\u2014in the only way they knew how : with harassment of her critics .\nThe unfolding drama among the far-right activists who attended AFPAC offers a glimpse into Fuentes \u2019 and his white nationalist America First movement \u2019 s commitment to bring their message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissenting voices fall in line .\nWitzke had made the mistake of defending her boss .\nBut Peters , who hosts \u201c The Stew Peters Show , \u201d is not getting off easy either .\nAfter Greene gave her opening speech in which she spoke about Christian nationalism and attacked transgender people , a slew of other extremist speakers followed , including Vincent James , who promotes white nationalism on his livestream , and Peters .\nPeters said on his show Monday that he was unaware that Greene was the surprise mystery speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumably Witzke , asked whether they should change his speech in which he had planned to criticize Greene ( as he has done in the past ) , Peters said he decided to go ahead with his speech as planned .\nAt the AFPAC podium , Peters blasted Greene , calling her a \u201c faker.\n\u201d He criticized her as perpetuating the \u201c useless own-the-libs conservatism \u201d and accused her of \u201c embracing race-based reparations to own the libs \u201d \u2014 \u201d disgusting !\n\u201d he added .\n( Later in the speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fauci should be \u201c hanging by the end of a noose somewhere \u201d and that Georgia congressional candidate Vernon Jones \u201c belongs in a prison cell , actually , truthfully , he probably belongs in an electric chair.\n\u201d ) As the evening wound down , Fuentes made a point of thanking Greene for her appearance .\n\u201c God bless Marjorie Taylor Greene , you have no idea what a big deal it was for her to come out and do that , \u201d Fuentes said , adding that it was easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard work to bring the fight to Congress .\nOf course , the next day , Greene spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference and told reporters that she didn \u2019 t know Nick Fuentes or his views and that she was only there to speak to \u201c young conservatives.\n\u201d Peters was livid .\n\u201c It is unsurprising to see liar and fraud Marjorie Taylor Greene so quickly stab Nick Fuentes in the stomach mere hours after pretending to fawn all over his fast-growing movement , \u201d he told The Daily Beast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of appreciating the attack on Greene , Fuentes \u2019 America First crowd lashed out at Peters , calling him a \u201c boomer.\n\u201d \u201c Very disappointing that Stew Peters\u2014 a former \u2018 rapper \u2019 and criminal is trying so hard to sabotage a perfect night by running to Zach Petrizzo at the Daily Beast to attack one of our featured speakers .\nHe was disrespectful to our staff , looked like a slob , and stormed out of the conference after his speech , \u201d Fuentes wrote on Telegram .\n( If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , give this a listen . )\n\u201c And for people who think he \u2019 s just \u2018 too hardcore \u2019 or whatever , he also tried to get me to promise to stop saying the n-word before even agreeing to attend the conference lol .\nGood riddance loser.\n\u201d In a broadcast Monday , Peters appeared bewildered by what took place .\nHe explained why he attacked Greene\u2014she \u2019 s \u201c fake \u201d \u2014claimed \u201c we always promise to give you the unvarnished truth , \u201d and recounted the so-called \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick Fuentes and the \u201c Groypers \u201d attacked Charlie Kirk , influencing him to take more extreme positions .\nThat \u2019 s what he was trying to do , Peters said , adding , \u201c Her speech was lame , too.\n\u201d Peters brought on his guest Neil Kumar , a candidate for Congress in Arkansas who has peddled white nationalism , whom Peters looked to for reassurance .\nKumar delivered , accusing Fuentes and the \u201c Groypers \u201d of being sellouts for chasing clout by \u201c simping for this serial adulterer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marjorie is a pathological liar and a total fraud.\n\u201d Peters went on to take a softer tone , hoping only that the \u201c Groypers \u201d would find their way back .\nThe Groypers \u2019 attacks on the far-right who disagree with them wasn \u2019 t limited to Peters and Witzke .\nThey lashed out at Joe Kent , an extreme MAGA congressional candidate in Washington state whom Fuentes had endorsed last year , for disavowing Fuentes Thursday .\nThat harassment continued even after Kent stood by his comments that Fuentes should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOn Thursday night , Fuentes spent his livestream trashing Kent .\nThese attacks could be seen as far-right actors following the whim of their leader who operates his movement like a cult and will suffer no criticism without striking back twice as hard .\nBut it is also clear that Fuentes has already decided that this is the moment for the movement to partner with extreme politicians whose ideology may not directly align with his in order to bring white nationalism to more mainstream Republican audiences .\nWhile Greene \u2019 s politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c at the area of greatest overlap between \u2018 bigotry \u2019 and \u2018 self-promotion , \u2019 \u201d her speech at AFPAC didn \u2019 t dip into white nationalism .\nInstead , it focused on transphobia and Christian nationalism\u2014takes that anyone sensible would find deeply troublesome but which the \u201c Groypers \u201d consider child \u2019 s play .\nIn a livestream Monday , Vincent James , a close ally of Fuentes , explained why what she said in her speech didn \u2019 t matter .\n\u201c We are breaking through this Overton Window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it doesn \u2019 t matter what they say .\nYou have to really think about the end game here , \u201d James said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s about gaining legitimacy.\n\u201d And while Kent , Peters , and Witzke may be useful to Fuentes and his movement , they \u2019 re nowhere near as valuable as Greene in spreading their message to a broader audience .\nBack on Witzke \u2019 s livestream\u2014where the live chat included takes like \u201c Never trust a femoid \u201d and incessant use of the N-word\u2014Witzke thanked Fuentes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick , for forgiving me , \u201d she said .\n\u201c I \u2019 m glad I \u2019 m not getting the Joe Kent treatment right now because God

s generally a hellscape for commuters .\nOrganizers of the \u201c People \u2019 s Convoy \u201d modeled their efforts after the trucker convoy in Canada that took over downtown Ottawa and shut down the bridge connecting Ontario to Michigan , disrupting trade and business in both countries .\nU.S. organizers demanded an end to vaccine and mask mandates and an end to the national emergency around COVID-19 that was declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under President Joe Biden .\nOn Monday , the truck convoy entered the Beltway with instructions to take up two lanes of traffic .\nBy 2 p.m. , the convoy was \u201c struggling to occupy one lane of traffic let alone two , \u201d The Daily Beast \u2019 s Zachary Petrizzo reported .\nRegular traffic separated convoy vehicles as it had on Sunday .\nWith diesel hitting $ 4.75 this week , driving their gas-guzzlers slowly around the Beltway seemed like an expensive effort in futility , especially since D.C. had lifted its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration and Congress had lifted their mask mandates .\nDespite failing to disrupt Washington \u2019 s roads , members of the convoy were rewarded Tuesday with meetings with Republican members of Congress .\nPeople \u2019 s Convoy co-organizer Brain Base and a representative from the American Foundation for Civil Liberties and Freedom , which has partnered with the People \u2019 s Convoy , met with Sens .\nTed Cruz and Ron Johnson .\nBrase stated the convoy \u2019 s demands to \u201c end the state of emergency , end the vaccine mandates \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unelected officials accountable for their actions that led to this , \u201d according to Sara Aniano , a researcher of far-right rhetoric who has been following the convoy .\nThe conversation also swung into QAnon rhetoric .\n\u201c This really is a spiritual war , and we \u2019 ve awakened a lot of people across the country , \u201d the AFCLF representative told Cruz and Johnson .\n\u201c We have a pendulum that \u2019 s swinging from \u2018 woke \u2019 to \u2018 the great awakening \u2019 .\n\u201d Shortly thereafter , a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marjorie Taylor Greene , and Thomas Massie for a \u201c trucker round table \u201d on Capitol Hill .\nThe truckers and adjacent activists complained about rising gas prices , mask and vaccine mandates , critical race theory , and government tyranny , with one trucker calling on the legislators to simply stop funding the government .\nWhen one convoy member from Michigan asked how to prevent stolen elections , Gaetz repeated debunked voter fraud claims about the state .\n\u201c Michigan , where they waited , the center in Detroit , to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure out how many ballots they needed , \u201d Gaetz said .\n\u201c You want to be very suspicious of federalizing elections .\nIf we federalize elections , then we have the swamp and the Washington , D.C. , Beltway telling you how to count votes in Lansing , Michigan.\n\u201d Massie decided to focus on mail-in ballots\u2014which Trump baselessly insists was a source of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election\u2014warning that \u201c they may have to find some excuse to go back to mail-in ballots.\n\u201d Greene was in agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the federal government to be involved in your election , \u201d she said .\nGaetz tried to wrap up the questions , joking that if the group stayed over its allotted time in the room he reserved , they would be accused of \u201c an insurrection.\n\u201d \u201c We don \u2019 t want to be accused of that , \u201d Greene said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s frowned upon here.\n\u201d The meeting with far-right members of Congress and the focus on the Big Lie from a convoy demanding an end to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just tuning in .\nBut the rhetoric exhibited on rally stages and social media throughout the convoy \u2019 s two-week trek across the country and the organizations supporting the convoy have always indicated that this was never just about public health mandates .\nA new report from the nonprofit research organization Advance Democracy , Inc. , details the ties that three organizations supporting the effort have to the so-called Stop the Steal movement , whose massive rallies to overturn the 2020 presidential election attracted many of the same elements featured in the People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative met with Cruz and Johnson , has faced scrutiny over its connections to dubious efforts to overturn 2020 election results in Michigan .\nIt claims to have raised more than $ 1.6 million for the convoy as of Monday , but it \u2019 s unclear how that money has been used .\nThe People \u2019 s Convoy also partnered with Freedom Fighter Nation on strategic and logistical planning , Brase , the convoy organizer , said on a Feb. 12 livestream .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t want to end up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we \u2019 re making sure that accountants and attorneys are handling it personally through freedomfighternation.org .\nThey have helped set up a lot of this infrastructure .\nThey are working with us one on one to help guide us , \u201d Brase said .\nFreedom Fighter Nation is led by Leigh Dundas , a COVID-19 and

our rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a turncoat fashion and sold us out and committed treason , we would be well within our rights to take \u2019 em out back and shoot \u2019 em or hang \u2019 em , because

Dundas and Chris Marston of AFCLF say they are working together on the People \u2019 s Convoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make its way across the country , it was also supported by The America Project , an organization founded by election conspiracy theorists Mike Flynn and Patrick Byrne .\nThe organization frequently promotes election fraud claims and contributed $ 3.2 million to fund the 2020 election audit in Maricopa , Arizona .\nThe group was listed as a supporter of the convoy in a Feb. 20 press release , but by Feb. 23\u2014when the convoy began its trip and stated it would not go into D.C. proper to disrupt traffic for fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced The America Project was \u201c stepping away \u201d from the convoy , alleging that it had been \u201c penetrated by the left.\n\u201d The convoy\u2014which an estimated 1,000 people committed time and money to join\u2014doesn \u2019 t appear to be penetrated by the left in the least bit .\nAt a Sunday night convoy rally in Hagerstown , Maryland , speakers railed against tyranny , stolen elections , and the mainstream media .\nQAnon conspiracy theorists like Ann Vandersteel , Christian nationalists , members of the Proud Boys hate group , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capitol on Jan. 6 , 2021 , were all in attendance .\nTerry Bouton , a historian at University of Maryland Baltimore County who attended the convoy \u2019 s Sunday night , likened the rally to a \u201c county fair , \u201d with music , food , and speeches building community and connections among factions of the fringe right-wing .\nThe convoy continues its Beltway circling this week .\nIt has yet to be as successful as its Canadian counterpart in bringing gridlock to the nation \u2019 s capital , but it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracting Republican star power and bringing activists from different factions of the movement together under the banner of \u201c freedom .\n\u201d", "author": "Kristen Doerer", "url":

participation on sports teams , arguing that trans girls would have an unfair advantage in competition .\nThis year , 29 states have considered such bills .\nHere \u2019 s the thing : These attacks on trans girls were never just about sport .\nThey are part of a broader right-wing campaign that seeks to deny trans kids equal opportunity\u2014and even access to gender-affirming health care .\nThat broader agenda was on display after Matt Schlapp , president of the American Conservative Union who puts on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for \u201c compassion \u201d for Lia Thomas , a 22-year-old trans swimmer at the University of Pennsylvania .\n\u201c No matter what one thinks of Lia \u2019 s ability to swim with women her story deserves our compassion .\nIt will be interesting to hear Lia \u2019 s [ point of view ] in 30 years , \u201d Schlapp wrote on Twitter .\nRight-wing politicians and pundits quickly slammed Schlapp for expressing compassion and attacked Thomas for hurting \u201c real \u201d \u2014that is , cis\u2014women .\n\u201c Just no , \u201d right-wing commentator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on to refer to Thomas using male pronouns .\n\u201c Have compassion for the real women whose college athletic experiences he \u2019 s selfishly destroying , \u201d Cardillo wrote .\n\u201c He \u2019 s a spoiled brat .\nNo conservative should ever enable this .\nNo sane person should promote this insanity.\n\u201d Matt Walsh\u2014the host of The Daily Wire \u2019 s podcast who tried to lure trans kids into participating in a fake documentary earlier this year\u2014said that by using \u201c her \u201d in reference to Thomas , Schlapp had \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Left.\n\u201d \u201c There \u2019 s nothing left to fight for , \u201d he added with a dramatic flourish .\nJenna Ellis\u2014a former Trump attorney who penned a coup memo\u2014accused the GOP establishment of caving to the \u201c LGBT agenda \u201d by using Thomas \u2019 proper pronouns .\nEllis , who considers anti-LGBTQ activist Michael Farris of Alliance Defending Freedom a mentor , called on conservatives to abandon CPAC .\nA slew of other attacks on Schlapp were reported by The Daily Mail , which ran pre-transition photos of Thomas .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to clarify that he has no desire to normalize trans people \u2019 s experiences , replying to Ellis , \u201c We score the bills aimed at protecting girls sports and our kids from gender confusion indoctrination .\nI don \u2019 t wish to normalize it.\n\u201d In a follow-up statement released Tuesday , he said , \u201c The left \u2019 s war on gender must be confronted , \u201d and he suggested that it was an accident that he used Thomas \u2019 proper pronouns .\nSo why are conservatives so alarmed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recognizing the dignity and humanity of trans people would make it harder for them to demonize and fearmonger .\nBehind the slate of bills attacking trans girls \u2019 ability to play sports are a host of right-wing and religious-right groups that drafted them , encouraged lawmakers to take them up , and laid the groundwork for their passage through disinformation and pressure campaigns , a Right Wing Watch investigation found last year .\nThe anti-LGBTQ American Principles Project has spent millions on ad campaigns fearmongering about trans girls , depicting them as boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect their daughters .\nAlliance Defending Freedom\u2014a multimillion-dollar litigation-and-legislation shop that the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated an anti-LGBTQ hate group\u2014drafted model legislation to keep trans kids from playing on sports teams corresponding with their gender identity .\nAnd the Heritage Foundation helped organize these efforts , contributing their own fearmongering about trans girls in girls \u2019 locker rooms .\nThese groups are a part of \u201c Promise to America \u2019 s Children , \u201d a coalition of 22 groups dedicated to fighting \u201c gender ideology , \u201d which paints the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights as a threat to the Christian right \u2019 s narrow vision of \u201c the natural family.\n\u201d The coalition \u2019 s positions go beyond not wanting trans girls to play sports : These groups want to prevent public schools from teaching sex education , to encourage schools to out LGBTQ kids to their parents , and to prevent trans kids from accessing gender-affirming health care .\nThey stand in opposition to the Equality Act .\nAnd should any state or federal legislator be interested in how to make these goals become law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What we \u2019 ve seen just this year alone makes it clear that the buck doesn \u2019 t stop at legislating trans girls out of girls \u2019 sports .\nEighteen states have introduced bills this year to limit trans kids \u2019 access to gender-affirming health care .\nIn Texas , Gov .\nGreg Abbott directed the state \u2019 s child and protection services to investigate gender-affirming care as \u201c child abuse , \u201d a development for which the American Principles Project took credit and thanked Steve Bannon for his help .\nThe Idaho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make gender-affirming care a felony , punishable by life in prison for anyone who helps a child travel out of state for such care .\nThat same day , a Florida bill that limits what can be taught about sexual orientation and gender identity ( and that allows parents to sue schools and teachers who teach these topics ) , was sent to Gov .\nRon DeSantis .\nAlarming , revamped rhetoric has proliferated among conservatives who suggest that people who talk about their sexuality or gender identity or take pride in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAmong those participating in such rhetoric is Matt Walsh who , it \u2019 s worth noting , is now participating in the redemption of far-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos , who made comments widely seen as condoning pedophilia .\nThe swift backlash to Schlapp \u2019 s call for compassion and the rapid spread of anti-LGBTQ legislation illustrate that demonization and fearmongering are central to anti-LGBTQ activists \u2019 goal to stop and reverse the advancement of LGBTQ rights .",

discussion , Perkins declared that the push for LGBTQ rights is \u201c the zenith of man \u2019 s rebellion against God \u201d and that the people who fight for such rights are controlled by \u201c demonic spirits.\n\u201d \u201c This whole thing with LGBT is the zenith of man \u2019 s rebellion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The Creator who created us in his own image , we \u2019 re saying , \u2018 No , we will decide\u2014not biology , not science\u2014we will decide what our gender is.\n\u2019 This is the zenith of rebellion against God .\nThat is the only explanation for how people are surrendering to this agenda , how adamant the advocates of this agenda are , and why we as believers in Jesus Christ who love people and do not want to see our children condemned to confusion for the rest of their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s word.\n\u201d \u201c Jesus made very clear there are two genders , not 52 , \u201d Perkins continued .\n\u201c We can never accommodate darkness .\nI \u2019 m going to be very clear about this tonight : Those that are opposing us on these issues are not our enemies .\nWe know that our enemies are spiritual .\nThe weapons of our warfare are not carnal .\nOur enemies are not flesh and blood ; they \u2019 re the spirits , the demonic spirits that control so much.\n\u201d Despite his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LGBTQ community , Perkins is an influential voice in conservative politics , regularly hosting Republican members of Congress on his \u201c Washington Watch \u201d radio show .\nThe Family Research Council , which has been designated an anti-LGBT hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center , had a hand in the formation of Trump administration policy on a wide variety of issues .", "author": "Kyle Mantyla", "url":

Marsha Blackburn said , \u201c a consistent pattern of giving child porn offenders lighter sentences.\n\u201d She was joined in such declarations by Sens .\nJosh Hawley and Ted Cruz , who used their questioning time to grill Jackson about several child porn cases over which she presided .\nFirst , a little fact checking .\nAs Sen. Richard Blumenthal noted during her hearing , Jackson \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c matched the recommendation by either the prosecution or the probation office in most of the cases.\n\u201d And as countless fact checks have made clear , Republicans \u2019 accusations are misleading .\nHawley , for his part , showed his hand before the hearings even began , tweeting a long thread claiming \u201c an alarming pattern when it comes to Judge Jackson \u2019 s treatment of sex offenders , especially those preying on children.\n\u201d During the hearing , Hawley took quotes by Jackson out of context\u2014presenting her questions as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of attack probably didn \u2019 t originate in his office .\nThe American Accountability Foundation\u2014a right-wing \u201c government corruption watchdog \u201d that boasts of using \u201c guerilla-style tactics \u201d \u2014published on Feb. 25 a note Jackson wrote during her time at Harvard , claiming Jackson \u201c argued that America \u2019 s judicial system is \u2018 unfair \u2019 to sexual predators.\n\u201d The claim ought to have been met with immediate skepticism .\nAfter all , it was coming from an organization whose stated goal \u201c is to take a big handful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Biden administration , and that \u2019 s what we \u2019 re going to do every day , \u201d as Tom Jones , founder of AFF and a former Ted Cruz staffer , told Fox News .\nThree days after the AFF published their post , The Post Millennial\u2014a source of rage bait for far-right audiences connected to far-right propagandist and \u201c Pizzagate \u201d conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec\u2014published a story with the same framing , citing AFF .\nFrom there , the accusation spread to other right-wing media , with groups like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vote , the right-wing communications and legal shop Judicial Watch , the anti-LGBTQ Family Research Council , Phyllis Schlafly Eagles , and Heritage Action , the 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) arm of the right-wing think tank Heritage Foundation , all amplifying the message .\nOne particularly blatant attack came in the form of an ad campaign from The Article III Project , a conservative organization with a \u201c brass knuckles \u201d approach .\n\u201c Activist judges like Ketanji Brown Jackson are more concerned about the well-being of pedophiles than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they may be living in your neighborhood , \u201d the narrator baselessly claims .\nThe campaign targeted more than a dozen lawmakers\u2014Democrats in swing states along with Republican senators who signaled their support of Jackson .\nMike Davis , president of the Article III Project , joined far-right operative Steve Bannon on his \u201c War Room \u201d podcast Monday to promote the campaign .\nUrging listeners to call their senators , Bannon told them to \u201c give them your unexpurgated opinion on what you think of Judge Jackson in this area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torture , and baby rape.\n\u201d \u201c People need to light up the Senate switchboard and let their senators know that they \u2019 re paying attention , \u201d Davis added .\n\u201c And if they ignore us this week , I don \u2019 t think we should ignore them in November.\n\u201d Even as media outlets and Democrats rightfully point out how this campaign appeals to the QAnon conspiracy theory movement , Hawley continued his antics , suggesting it was no conspiracy theory .\nOn Tuesday , he went to the Senate floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from sentencing below federal guidelines in cases involving sexual offenses against children .\n\u201c I just went to the Senate floor to try to pass a bill toughening sentences on child pornographers .\nAnd the Democrats blocked it , again calling the child porn crisis a \u2018 conspiracy theory.\n\u2019 And that tells you everything you need to know , \u201d he claimed in a tweet .\nWhile some right-wing actors just wanted to test out an \u201c accuse everyone of being pedophiles \u201d playbook , there were others who just wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTony Perkins , president of the religious-right Family Research Council , admitted as much in the beginning of

Watch The Water , \u201d was finally released Monday night .\nPeters , who regularly hosts far-right activists , white nationalists , conspiracy theorists , GOP congressional candidates , elected

medical researcher \u201d Bryan Ardis , Peters \u2019 documentary alleged that COVID-19 is not a virus at all but rather a synthesized form of snake venom that is intentionally being spread via

a definition at all ?\n\u2019 So I actually looked up what \u2019 s the definition and on Dictionary.com , it brings up 13 definitions : \u2018 Corona , religiously , ecclesiastically , means gold

how ironic would it be that the Catholic Church , or whoever , would use the one symbol of an animal that represents evil in all religion ?\n\u2026 You take that snake or that serpent , and you figure

attack on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c stop Trump from running in 2024 \u201d and \u201c usher in a New World Order.\n\u201d Under Alexander \u2019 s leadership , the Stop the Steal campaign perpetuated the Big Lie that the 2020 election was stolen and sought to keep former President Donald Trump in power .\nIts rallies featured radical conspiracy theorists like Jones , Christian nationalists like Greg

advocated for violence and civil war numerous times , and on the eve of the insurrection led a crowd in chants of \u201c Victory or death !\n\u201d When Trump loyalists stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 , Alexander told his followers , \u201c I do not denounce this , I do not disavow this \u201d \u2014declarations Right Wing Watch captured on video .\nThrough a lawyer , Alexander told the New York Times Friday that he had received a subpoena from a federal grand jury and would cooperate with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In December , Alexander had cooperated with the Jan. 6 committee , sitting for eight hours of testimony , which he called , \u201c 8 hours of accusations , lies , and conspiracy theories digging into my First Amendment rights.\n\u201d But on Jones \u2019 show , Jones insisted that

convoluted conspiracy theory , further throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place\u2014how much cooperation Alexander would be providing .\n\u201c You were the first to go to the committee in the lion \u2019

segment on me this weekend .\nAnd they actually kind of soberly laid out the case that I wasn \u2019 t cooperating with the feds , \u201d Alexander said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ t get your hopes up.\n\u2019 They said , \u2018 This is an eccentric character .\nHe says wild things on InfoWars.\n\u2019 And then they said , \u2018 You know , he would never be a witness against Trump .\nSo what the feds are obviously doing , because they subpoenaed him , and he \u2019 s not , and he didn \u2019 t come in voluntarily , is that they \u2019 re , they \u2019 re probing him for information that may lead to , you know , other people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I thought , \u2018 Wow , there \u2019 s my enemies , at least kind of very soberly trying to let down their audience \u2019 s excitement.\n\u2019 \u201d Jones and Alexander moved on to the FBI \u2019 s handling of the plot to kidnap Michigan Gov .\nGretchen Whitmer , and the prosecution \u2019 s failure to secure a guilty verdict against four defendants .\nThey claimed that the FBI was guilty of entrapment in Michigan , and that Michigan was a precursor to the Capitol attack .\n( Immediately after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began creating the narrative that it was a false flag attack . )\n\u201c What we know about the FBI case in Michigan is that they moved the guy who was in charge and really set up that plot to cover for her killing all those elderly people in nursing homes , \u201d Alexander claimed .\n\u201c So they created this\u2014to try to give her a more national profile\u2014they created this stupid coup in Michigan , and then they move that guy over to Washington to oversee the Jan. 6 cases.\n\u201d But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s telling , was just a small part of a broad conspiracy to get rid of elections , the Republican Party , and Christians , with the end goal of ushering in a \u201c stateless New World Order.\n\u201d \u201c Folks need to realize we \u2019 re on a three-part track to stop Trump from running in 2024 , \u201d Alexander said .\n\u201c There \u2019 s the J6 commission committee .\nThere \u2019 s the DOJ investigation .\nAnd then there \u2019 s the civil cases .\nYou just saw Judge Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that Donald Trump was likely in charge of a criminal conspiracy to overthrow the government .\nHe threw the J6 committee a bone there , [ the ] J6 committee then throws the DOJ a bone and says , \u2018 If you don \u2019 t charge , then we \u2019 ll criminally refer him.\n\u2019 So you know , we just live in a preposterous time .\nThey \u2019 re running the last part of their coup because they don \u2019 t want more elections .\nThey don \u2019 t want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want Christians .\nThey want to implode us , and they want to usher us into a stateless New World Order.\n\u201d \u201c This all seems to serve the great reset , \u201d Alexander continued .\n\u201c I think that if you take down America , the world questions whether or not there can be nation states .\nSo I think this is all part of their plan .\nWe \u2019 re watching it in real time , we find ourselves as characters in his dystopian novel.\n\u201d \u201c We are not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , you know , the right wing has never been the monsters that they think we are , \u201d he said .\n\u201c They \u2019 re the eugenicists , they \u2019 re the murderers , they \u2019 re the baby killers , they \u2019 re the pedophiles.\n\u201d Alexander circled back to the Michigan case and claimed that another false flag attack was just months away .\n\u201c The Michigan case was a prelude to J6 .\nBut I think J6 is a prelude to whatever false flag they \u2019 re planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the midterms or shortly thereafter , \u201d Alexander continued .\nJones agreed .\n\u201c The next move is a false flag , which they believe will trigger a civil war , which is a smokescreen for the Democrat Deep State\u2014and then RINOs are allied with the neo-cons\u2014to outlaw political dissent , create a one-party state like Venezuela with a ceremonial opposition party , and basically come after their detractors , \u201d Jones said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not about Ali Alexander and myself .\nIt \u2019 s about preparing the false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it \u2019 s worth noting that Jones is the type of radical conspiracy theorist who baselessly claimed that the Sandy Hook mass shooting was a false flag and accused the parents of the murdered children of being paid actors .\nUnsurprisingly , he lost that defamation case .\nAlexander , meanwhile , has repeatedly lied about his comments on Jan. 6 .", "author":

that we are at a loss to even explain what he was talking about .\nLater , event organizer Francine Fosdick sat down with fellow QAnon conspiracy theorist Sheila Holm for a discussion about how the

Wade , eliminating a constitutional right to abortion and potentially eviscerating the constitutional underpinning of rulings protecting privacy and the rights of LGBTQ Americans .\nWhile overturning Roe has been an intense focus and will be a massive victory for the religious right and right-wing legal movement , reversing Roe is just one part of a much broader agenda that has been promoted by the right-wing Federalist Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it to pack the federal courts .\nTrump basically outsourced his judicial picks to the group \u2019 s activists .\nNow , with the Trump justices cementing a hard-right majority on the Court , Federalist Society lawyers and judges and their political allies can move even more aggressively to reverse a century \u2019 s worth of precedents , pulling the constitutional rug out from under the New Deal and Great Society anti-poverty programs like Medicare and Social Security ; further gutting voting rights in favor of states \u2019 rights ; weakening the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermining the federal government \u2019 s ability to regulate corporations and protect workers and communities .\nA leaked draft of a Supreme Court decision written by Justice Samuel Alito dispenses with any notions of nuance in favor of a complete repudiation and reversal of Roe .\nIf the court ultimately rules along the lines set out in Alito \u2019 s draft , abortion would be banned or severely restricted in more than half the states immediately or in short order .\nSome states already have bans in place .\nSome have passed \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take effect at the moment of Roe \u2019 s demise .\nOthers , including Michigan and Wisconsin , still have old laws on the books that will come back into force once Alito and his colleagues have removed the constitutional barrier to their enforcement .\nWhile some anti-choice groups have talked about preparing for a \u201c 50-state battle , \u201d they have already won many of those battles .\nEliminating Roe would intensify the already existing disparities in access to abortion between states .\nMany people seeking that care will be forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also being targeted by anti-abortion legislators .\nAnd for all the federalism-embracing , give-it-back-to-the-states rhetoric , expect anti-choice activists to quickly demand a national ban on abortion .\nThe state-by-state approach pursued by anti-choice activists was a strategic decision to bypass Congress , chip away at Roe , and build momentum toward a day when the Court was in their ideological grasp .\nBut a nationwide ban is their goal .\nThis is not speculation .\nThe amicus brief submitted by Princeton University professor Robert P. George , a brief cited in Alito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George argues that \u201c prenatal persons \u201d and \u201c unborn children \u201d are persons under the 14th Amendment from the moment of conception , and therefore that states should be required to treat abortion as homicide .\nHe argues that Congress would have to enforce such a ruling \u201c if States failed in their duties.\n\u201d George \u2019 s brief mirrors the arguments of the hard-core \u201c personhood \u201d wing of the anti-choice movement , which has successfully pushed anti-choice legislators away from even granting exceptions to abortion bans in cases of rape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at risk , too , as anti-abortion activists are hard at work to make the public believe that some widely used forms of contraception are the equivalent of abortion .\nAlito \u2019 s draft includes language seemingly meant to suggest that if adopted by the majority , his ruling would not put LGBTQ equality at risk .\n\u201c Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.\n\u201d Referring to the Court \u2019 s rulings in Lawrence v. Texas , which overturned state laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hodges , which recognized marriage equality , Alito \u2019 s draft says that the Court ruling against a right to abortion \u201c does not undermine them in any way , \u201d in part because those decisions do not involve \u201c the critical moral question posed by abortion.\n\u201d But that reads as high-level gaslighting .\nIn a 2020 comment on the court \u2019 s decision not to hear a case brought by a marriage-resisting county court clerk , Alito and Clarence Thomas disparaged Obergefell , saying that a right to same-sex marriage can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And many anti-choice activists have portrayed opposition to marriage equality as inhabiting the same legal and moral plane as opposition to abortion .\nA brief submitted by Texas Right to Life was filed by Jonathan Mitchell , the author of the Texas abortion ban that the Supreme Court has allowed to take effect .\nThe brief sneers at \u201c court-invented rights to homosexual behavior and same-sex marriage , \u201d calling the Lawrence and Obergefell decisions \u201c as lawless as Roe.\n\u201d Robert George , who argues that states must treat abortion as homicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equality for LGBTQ people .\nA founder of the National Organization for Marriage , George co-authored The Manhattan Declaration , a 2009 manifesto whose signers frame opposition to abortion and marriage equality as similarly non-negotiable .\nThe manifesto concludes with this : Because we honor justice and the common good , we will not comply with any edict that purports to compel our institutions to participate in abortions , embryo-destructive research , assisted suicide and euthanasia , or any other anti-life act ; nor will we bend to any rule purporting to force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat them as marriages or the equivalent , or refrain from proclaiming the truth , as we know it , about morality and immorality and marriage and the family .\nAnti-LGBTQ activist Ryan Anderson , a Robert George prot\u00e9g\u00e9 , has urged anti-marriage equality activists to follow his road map to overturning Obergefell , with the religious right \u2019 s anti-Roe campaign as a guide .\nThe first step in his plan was to denounce the marriage equality decision as illegitimate , which George and others have done relentlessly .\nOther anti-LGBTQ leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perkins and National Organization for Marriage President Brian Brown , have also expressed hope that success in eradicating a right to abortion points the way toward doing the same for marriage equality .\nAnd it is not just about marriage .\nMany religious-right legal and political advocacy groups defended state laws that made gay people de facto criminals and opposed the Lawrence decision .\nYou can hear that in the rhetoric of anti-LGBTQ activists who express a desire to return to a time when gay people were disfavored in law and demonized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are working to return us to that time with a wave of anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and legislation smearing LGBTQ people and their allies as \u201c groomers \u201d and sexual predators .\nIndeed , anti-choice activist Janet Porter recently said she hopes to apply the nefarious strategy of Texas \u2019 s abortion ban , which allows anyone to sue anyone who helps a person obtain an abortion , to LGBTQ issues in schools , making teachers , librarians , and school board members vulnerable to lawsuits for \u201c pushing this garbage on our children.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court \u2019 s conservative and far-right justices have repeatedly weakened the federal Voting Rights Act , giving a green light to state legislators to pass wave after wave of voting restrictions .\nThat is far from the only way that the right-wing legal movement hopes Trump \u2019 s justices can continue to \u201c fundamentally change the country.\n\u201d In 2017 , Republican congressional and White House aides told a conference of religious-right activists that getting a second Supreme Court justice would allow Trump to create \u201c epic , titanic \u201d shifts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created when Democrats had wide congressional majorities .\nTrump also filled lower federal courts with ideologically minded judges who give hard-right justices like Alito and Thomas the \u201c troops \u201d to carry out their judicial counterrevolution .\nDismantling much of what the federal government does to address poverty and access to education and health care has been a long-term project , a reality reflected in a bit of Federalist Society humor : \u201c Rome wasn \u2019 t burned in a day.\n\u201d But right-wing funders knew their long-term investments could bring huge returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third Supreme Court pick , Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u2014who some anti-choice activists believe was anointed by God to help the Supreme Court overturn Roe\u2014could also strengthen the religious right \u2019 s already successful push to weaponize and redefine religious liberty in ways that weaken the Establishment Clause , which prohibits the establishment of religion by Congress , and the separation between church and state .\nThe net result is all too clear .\nAs tragic as it is , the reversal of Roe is just one step in the far-right campaign to rewrite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harming millions of Americans in the process .", "author": "Peter Montgomery", "url":

muses .\nHe \u2019 s on white nationalist Jared Taylor \u2019 s \u201c American Renaissance \u201d podcast .\nThe date is Feb. 9 .\n\u201c That would change the global conversation .\nI mean , it would make national headlines , it would push the Overton Window , it would make it\u2014it brings white advocacy into the mainstream.\n\u201d Kumar , a 26-year-old self-described \u201c white advocate , \u201d faces off against incumbent Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressional District today .\nKumar isn \u2019 t expected to win , but that \u2019 s not the point .\nThe point is to move the Overton Window\u2014the band of acceptable discourse\u2014to include white nationalist ideology and the deadly great replacement theory .\nAnd white nationalists are eager to help him do that .\nKumar is an unlikely conduit for such ideas .\nBorn to a white mother and Indian father who immigrated to the United States , his own family is a product of immigration .\nNevertheless , Kumar prides himself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Veterans , and he has written for multiple white nationalist and neo-Confederate outlets , including American Renaissance , VDARE , Identity Dixie , and Reckonin \u2019 in which he peddles the great replacement theory .\n( He once referred to President Abraham Lincoln as \u201c the godless genocider-in-chief.\n\u201d ) His writings and speeches have landed him invitations to a number of white nationalist platforms and the endorsements of Peter Brimelow , Jared Taylor , Greg Johnson , and Robert Wallace , and radical conspiracy theorist Stew Peters .\nThe first promise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stop the Great Replacement.\n\u201d An old racist ideology that has gained new life in recent years , the great replacement theory posits that the so-called white race is at risk of being destroyed by Black and other non-white people .\nSome antisemitic versions , including the one Kumar subscribes to , push the lie that immigration is a scheme created by Jewish people to \u201c replace \u201d white Americans with people of color .\nThe Buffalo shooter , who targeted Black people in a Buffalo , New York , supermarket , killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifesto .\nKumar \u2019 s platform calls for imposing a 20-year moratorium on all immigration , though he would make an exception for white Afrikaners .\nHe also calls for ending \u201c birthright citizenship.\n\u201d \u201c I make no distinction between legal and illegal immigration because they \u2019 re both the same : an attack on our national sovereignty and an attack on white America , \u201d Kumar told Taylor .\n\u201c So what I \u2019 m calling for is a 20-year moratorium on all immigration , deporting every illegal , building the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ending birthright citizenship , denying public services to illegals , and taxing remittances at up to 100 percent.\n\u201d Such rhetoric has won him the derision of the Arkansas GOP , which went as far as to designate Kumar a \u201c non-recommended candidate \u201d in a rare move .\nIn the October 2021 announcement , the state GOP said that it won \u2019 t endorse or defend \u201c racist , bigoted , sexist or threatening language by any candidate.\n\u201d The designation didn \u2019 t sit well with Kumar .\nLater that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his show to lash out at the Arkansas GOP and the \u201c satanic globalist cabal.\n\u201d \u201c

singularly focused on building ties to those who can get him close to former president and has bragged that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his events is \u201c legitimizing what we are doing in the minds of many

introducing Clark , Billings reported that the tour is scheduled to continue through the midterms and that Trump himself is going to be participating at the final tour stop before the November

Congressman Mo Brooks , and then Congressman Andy Biggs , \u201d GOP operative Ali Alexander said in a Dec. 28 , 2020 , Periscope video .\n\u201c We four schemed up of putting maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting , so that who we couldn \u2019 t lobby , we could change the hearts and the minds of Republicans who were in that body , hearing our loud roar from outside.\n\u201d The video , which was captured by investigative reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlights the role played by Alexander , his so-called \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d campaign , and far-right members of Congress in the failed insurrection at the U.S. Capitol .\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack launches its first public hearings June 9 , and Alexander and \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d are likely to figure prominently in its findings .\nAlexander sat for eight hours of testimony in front of the committee on Dec. 9 , and in April , a lawyer for Alexander said he would cooperate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 investigation\u2014a claim on which Alexander promptly threw cold water .\nRight Wing Watch extensively covered Ali Alexander and the so-called Stop the Steal movement ahead of Jan. 6 .\nHere \u2019 s what you need to know .\nWho is Ali Alexander ?\nWhat is \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d ?\nOn Nov. 4 , 2020 , as mail-in ballots began to be counted and shifted the election in favor of Joe Biden , former President Donald Trump falsely declared that the ongoing efforts to count millions of outstanding ballots were an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact won .\nHours later , Alexander publicly launched \u201c Stop the Steal , \u201d a campaign to get right-wing activists to discredit mail-in voting , disrupt vote-counting , and \u200bfalsely accuse Democrats of stealing the presidential election .\nThe campaign held its first rally outside Arizona \u2019 s state capitol building in Phoenix that evening , featuring Rep. Paul Gosar , who with a bullhorn in hand , addressed the crowd before introducing \u201c Pizzagate \u201d booster Mike Cernovich , who threatened imaginary anti-fascist activists .\nAnd so began months of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far-right members of Congress , QAnon and election conspiracy theorists , Christian nationalists , and far-right anti-government groups , all under the MAGA banner .\nAlexander , n\u00e9e Ali Akbar , has long worked in Republican politics , coming up under the tutelage of \u201c dirty trickster \u201d Roger Stone .\nHe has connections to deep pockets , too : \u200ba PAC advised by Alexander received a $ 60,000 donation in 2016 from pro-Trump billionaire Robert Mercer\u200b .\nThese Republican connections have persisted despite his habit of noting when members of the media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with far-right figures like Unite the Right white supremacist attendee Matt Colligan and members of the neo-fascist Proud Boys .\nAlexander \u2019 s \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d campaign wasn \u2019 t the first to go by that name .\nLongtime GOP operative and Trump confidant Roger Stone first popularized the phrase \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d during the 2016 presidential election .\nIn 2018 , Alexander , Stone , and far-right commentator Jack Posobiec launched a \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d campaign during a ballot recount for Florida \u2019 s Senate race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nelson .\nPro-Trump activists from around the country descended on Florida to protest and spread misinformation , insisting that Democrats were trying to \u201c steal \u201d the election from Scott .\nIt served as a dry run for the 2020 presidential election .\nSure enough , in September 2020 , Posobiec and Alexander discussed rebooting the campaign .\nWhat was their role in the lead up to Jan. 6 ?\nAlexander served as the lead organizer for \u201c Stop the Steal.\n\u201d The campaign targeted Pennsylvania , Michigan , Wisconsin , Arizona , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whose cities are home to predominantly Black and brown voters\u2014holding rallies and spreading election disinformation on social media .\nHe called on figures he knew from his time as a member of the highly secretive Council for National Policy and through his years in Republican politics to join the effort , including activists Amy and Kylie Kremer , Jack Posobiec , Brandon Straka , Scott Presler , Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch , Ed Martin of Phyllis Schlafly Eagles , and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk .\nHe brought into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adviser Michael Flynn and Trump team attorneys Sidney Powell and Lin Wood\u2014who have since been disciplined for bringing false lawsuits alleging election fraud .\nMost joined the so-called \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d movement in a public capacity ; others promoted the same messaging through their own organizations and organized behind the scenes .\nAlexander welcomed extremists into the campaign \u2019 s ranks .\nMale supremacist Mike Cernovich , white nationalist Nick Fuentes , and far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones were among the first to answer Alexander \u2019 s call .\nAlongside white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Baked Alaska , Fuentes galvanized crowds of white men to attend \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d rallies across the county , while Jones spread disinformation through his Infowars network , raised funds for the Jan. 6 rally , and brought a caravan of supporters to rallies .\nOn Nov. 14 , \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d came to the nation \u2019 s capital .\nThousands of Trump loyalists , conspiracy theorists , and members of far-right groups took to the streets .\nMarjorie Taylor Green , Lauren Boebert , and Madison Cawthorn\u2014all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizers .\nRadical conspiracy theorist Alex Jones yelled unintelligibly into a bullhorn .\nMembers of the Proud Boys hate group roamed the streets looking for fights and found them late in the evening .\nFuentes \u2019 America First group , \u200ba youth-focused white-nationalist outfit , commanded the crowd \u2019 s attention with chants of \u201c America First.\n\u201d A second Dec. 12 rally was deeply steeped in Christian nationalist and violent rhetoric .\nOath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes called on Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act and declare martial law , threatening a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fail to do so .\nWhile rallies brought the whole of the MAGA movement together , Alexander held regular Periscopes to spread disinformation and provide action items to Trump supporters .\nAlexander called on \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d activists to lobby the state legislatures of battleground states won by Joe Biden to ignore the election results and send Republican electors to the electoral college to give Trump enough electoral votes .\nHe called on state Republican legislators to declare the election fraudulent and threatened them with a primary challenger should they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lawyers were focused on Jan. 6 , the day Congress would certify the electoral votes .\nMore than 100 House members and a dozen Senators committed to voting against certifying the election .\nTrump and the apparatus around him began to pressure Vice President Mike Pence to use his ceremonial duty to block or delay Biden \u2019 s certification .\n\u201c Stop the Steal \u201d fed into that pressure , with \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d friend Lin Wood going as far as to call for the vice president \u2019 s execution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u201c [ s ] tatistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election.\n\u201d He encouraged his followers to come to D.C. : \u201c Big protest in DC on January 6th .\nBe there , will be wild !\n\u201d Alexander had already planned a Jan. 6 D.C. protest , but he began fighting his one-time fellow activists Kylie and Amy Kremer for control of the big Jan. 6 rally .\nThe Kremers had used the \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d banner for their cross country bus tour and a competing December rally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nProPublica reported that Katrina Pierson , whom the White House put in charge of the rally planning , \u201c helped arrange a deal where those organizers deemed too extreme to speak at the Ellipse could do so on the night of Jan. 5.\n\u201d That meant Alexander and his cohort were relegated to speaking on the evening of Jan. 5 , while the Kremers took the lead on the Jan. 6 event held at the Ellipse .\nAlexander held that Jan. 5 rally and planned his own separate \u201c wild \u201d Jan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Capitol building to follow the main \u201c Save America \u201d rally .\nAlexander spent weeks in the lead up to the Capitol insurrection calling for \u201c rebellion , \u201d starting chants of \u201c victory or death , \u201d and using rhetoric of the American Revolution and spiritual warfare to call for action should Congress certify the election of President Joe Biden .\nHe engaged in violent rhetoric , appearing to even advocate for physical attacks against members of Congress who he said stole the election .\nThe Jan. 5 rally served as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speakers delivered Christian nationalist messages and veiled threats of violence if Congress failed to reject Biden electors .\nBikers for Trump founder Chris Cox told rally-goers that the United States was on the brink of a revolution and that he would \u201c take the first bullet.\n\u201d Right Wing Watch reported at the time : What was Ali Alexander and the campaign \u2019 s role on Jan. 6 ?\nOn the day of the insurrection , Alexander took to Twitter early in the morning to declare it the \u201c First official day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold his \u201c wild \u201d protest by the Capitol , but it would never materialize .\nTrump loyalists packed into the Ellipse , eager to stop what they saw as a fraudulent election .\nSpeaking from the stage and wearing a bulletproof vest , Rep. Mo Brooks , whom Alexander had recently called a friend , told attendees that Jan. 6 is \u201c the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass .\n\u2026 Are you willing to do what it takes to fight for America ?\nLouder !\nWill you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you don \u2019 t fight like hell , you \u2019 re not going to have a country anymore , \u201d Trump told the crowd .\nHe urged activists to march to the Capitol to make their voices heard .\nThey did as they were told .\nLeaving the rally at the Ellipse after Trump \u2019 s speech , where he was a VIP guest with far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones , Alexander followed Jones through the Capitol grounds , past barricades , and up the Capitol steps .\nAt that point\u2014around 2 p.m.\u2014the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats and Media ended the Republic and the people responded .\nWelcome to \u2018 duhhh \u2019 , \u201d he tweeted an hour later .\nAlexander emerged on One America News Network \u2019 s terrace overlooking the Capitol to record a video , posted on the \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d Twitter account by his associate Michael Coudrey at 4:26 p.m.\u2014well after the violence had begun .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t disavow this .\nI do not denounce this , \u201d Alexander said , gesturing to the scene behind him .\nTrump loyalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Capitol steps .\n\u201c This is completely peaceful , looks like , so far .\nAnd there are a couple of agitators that I obviously don \u2019 t endorse , \u201d he claimed despite having seen what took place on the steps not long before .\nBy the end of the video , Alexander was back to encouraging rebellion .\n\u201c StoptheSteal.us is going to be the home of the rebellion against an illegitimate government.\n\u201d Right Wing Watch captured the video , which was later deleted .\nWhere is Ali Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol .\nIn February , he briefly reappeared and said he had been plotting to restart rallies in March , abolish the media , and build a separate society for Trump supporters .\nHe declared that \u201c civil war \u201d was the only outcome available to those who opposed Biden \u2019 s presidency .\nBut Alexander was kicked off Twitter and most mainstream social media platforms .\nHe lost access to his Venmo , Cashapp , and Paypal .\nHe turned to alternative social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn October 2021 , the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack issued three subpoenas to Alexander , the Stop the Steal organization , and Nathan Martin , who worked with Alexander and reserved the Jan. 6 rally space .\nAlexander accused the government of \u201c gaslighting \u201d and blamed the violence on \u201c agitators dressed in militant outfits.\n\u201d Jan. 6 , he said , was a government \u201c psyop.\n\u201d In December 2021 , Alexander testified for eight hours in a closed-door hearing and asked the House select committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his opening statement , which was leaked to the New York Times , he denied wrongdoing and passed the buck , placing blame for the violence on Katrina Pierson , Kylie Kremer , and Amy Kremer .\nIn a lawsuit seeking to prevent the select committee from obtaining his phone records , Alexander confirmed to congressional investigators that ahead of Jan. 6 , he had communicated with several GOP congressmen\u2014Reps .\nPaul Gosar , Mo Brooks , and Andy Biggs\u2014as well as with Kimberly Guilfoyle , Donald Trump Jr. \u2019 s girlfriend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle .\nIn April , a lawyer for Alexander said he would cooperate with the Department of Justice \u2019 s Jan. 6 investigation .\nThe following day , Alexander joined Alex Jones \u2019 show to suggest he wouldn \u2019 t cooperate .\nHe went on to call the effort to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol a conspiracy to \u201c stop Trump from running in 2024 \u201d and \u201c usher in a New World Order.\n\u201d A few days later , Alexander joined Alex Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c there is a time for legitimate violence when there is legitimate tyranny .\n\u201d", "author": "Kristen Doerer", "url":

"content": "The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 , 2021 , attack on the U.S. Capitol held its second hearing Monday .\nAt the heart of the second hearing : how former President Donald Trump knew he lost the 2020 presidential election but continued to make false stolen-election claims anyway\u2014claims that outraged his supporters and drove some of them to violence .\nRep. Zoe Lofgren of California led questioning .\nFour witnesses appeared in person : Chris Stirewalt , the former Fox News digital political director who was ousted after accurately calling Arizona for Joe Biden ; Ben Ginsberg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pak , the former U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia ; and Al Schmidt , a Republican former city commissioner in Philadelphia .\nThe committee \u2019 s star witness for today \u2019 s hearing , Bill Stepien , who served as Trump \u2019 s campaign manager , was scheduled to testify in person but pulled out at the last moment after his wife went into labor .\nVideo interviews with Stepien and other Republican witnesses told the rest of the story : that Trump continued to make false claims about election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they weren \u2019 t true .\nHere are four takeaways from the second day of the hearings .\nTrump \u2019 s advisers told him the election was still up in the air and that he should not declare victory .\nOn Nov. 3 , 2020 , Rudy Giuliani , the former mayor of New York and Trump \u2019 s personal lawyer , wanted to speak to the president .\nIt was Election Day , and votes were still being counted as the evening wore on .\nGiuliani was directed to speak first with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Justin Clark , as well as Chief of Staff Mark Meadows .\nAn \u201c intoxicated \u201d Giuliani wanted Trump to \u201c declare victory and say we won it outright , \u201d Miller said .\n\u201c It was far too early to be making any calls like that , \u201d Stepien told the committee .\n\u201c Ballots were still being counted , ballots were still going to be counted for days .\nAnd it was far too early to be making any proclamation like that.\n\u201d Miller , too , thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying we should not go and declare victory till we had a better sense of the numbers , \u201d he told the committee .\nIvanka Trump , who was in the White House with her father that evening , said \u201c the results were still being counted , it was becoming clear that the race would not be called on election night.\n\u201d Eventually , Giuliani did speak to Trump that evening .\nWhen Stepien told the president that the election was still undecided and advised him against declaring victory , Trump told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessment was wrong and that he \u2019 d be going in a different direction .\nIn the wee hours on Nov. 4 , 2020 , Trump took to a podium in the East Wing of the White House and spoke to his supporters .\nHe declared premature victory .\n\u201c This is a fraud on the American public , \u201d he claimed .\n\u201c Frankly , we did win this election.\n\u201d Two teams within the White House began to take shape , according to Stepien .\n\u201c Team Normal \u201d on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , and \u201c Team Crazy \u201d on the other , with Rudy Giuliani and Trump team lawyer Sidney Powell .\nGiuliani and Powell \u2019 s election-fraud theories\u2014which included that 100,000 ballots for Biden were brought in waste paper baskets , that an algorithm flipped votes for Biden , and that Hugo Chavez was behind election machine fraud\u2014were seen as far-fetched by many of Trump \u2019 s advisers from the very beginning .\n\u201c What they were proposing , I thought , was nuts , \u201d Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Normal \u201d told the president that these allegations of fraud had no merit , he began to sideline them in favor of \u201c Team Crazy.\n\u201d \u201c I have confidence in Rudy , \u201d Trump reportedly told Jared Kushner after Kushner raised concerns about the false election-fraud theories .\nTrump \u2019 s own DOJ said claims of voter fraud were false .\nTrump continued to repeat these false claims .\nThe allegations of voter fraud were \u201c bullshit , \u201d former Attorney General William Barr said he told the president .\nThe Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d of voter fraud claims , with Barr describing the process as a game of \u201c whack-a-mole.\n\u201d From the beginning , the claims were \u201c bogus and silly and usually based on complete misinformation , \u201d he told committee investigators , echoing statements he had made during a March interview with NBC \u2019 s Lester Holt .\nAt one point , Trump asked Barr to intervene , and Barr , who was a loyal ally to Trump , explained that the Department of Justice does not choose sides in elections .\nOn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Associated Press there was no evidence of widespread fraud , and no evidence of fraud that would have affected the outcome of the election .\nTrump was livid .\nIn a conversation with Trump , Barr explained that the voter fraud claims were false and \u201c idiotic.\n\u201d \u201c I told him that the stuff his people were shuttling out to the people was bullshit , \u201d Barr said .\nThe next day , on Dec. 2 , 2020 , Trump released a video repeating some of the very same claims Barr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December .\n\u201c He was becoming detached from reality , \u201d Barr said .\n\u201c I didn \u2019 t want to be a part of it.\n\u201d After Barr left , Jeffery Rosen , the acting Attorney General , continued to investigate voter fraud claims and told Trump that they were false .\nRichard Donoghue , the former acting attorney general , did as well .\n\u201c There were so many of these allegations that when you gave him a very direct answer on one of them , he wouldn \u2019 t fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d go on to another allegation , \u201d Donoghue said .\n\u201c My opinion then and my opinion now is that the election was not stolen by fraud , \u201d Barr told the committee .\nTrump and his campaign defrauded supporters , raising $ 250 million on false pretenses .\nBetween Election Day and Jan. 6 , the Trump campaign sent millions of emails to supporters .\nMany alleged fraud and called on small-dollar donors to help fund the Election Defense Fund , claiming that their donations would allow the campaign to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the select committee says , never existed .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t believe there is actually a fund called the Election Defense Fund , \u201d Hanna Allred , a former Trump campaign staffer , told the committee .\nGary Cober , former Trump campaign digital director , called the nonexistent fund a \u201c marketing tactic.\n\u201d The campaign raised $ 250 million off of it .\nMost of the money went to Trump \u2019 s \u201c Save America PAC , \u201d and not to election litigation , according to committee investigators .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro-Trump organizations , including : $ 1 million to the Conservative Partnership Institute ( connected to Meadows and promoting voter suppression in the name of \u201c election integrity \u201d ) ; $ 1 million to America First Policy Institute ( connected to several Trump former administration officials ) ; over $ 200,000 to the Trump Hotel Collection ; and $ 5 million to Event Strategies , Inc. ( which ran the Jan. 6 , 2021 , event on the Ellipse ) .\nIn the first hearing , the select committee laid out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 election .\nMonday \u2019 s hearing examined the first part of that plan : how Trump convinced millions of Americans that the electron was stolen from him by overwhelming fraud , even as his own legal advisers told him he lost the election .\nThis created the justification for Trump supporters to march on the U.S. Capitol , a point Rep. Liz Cheney drove home in her opening statement .\n\u201c Mr .\nChairman , hundreds of our countrymen have faced criminal charges , many are serving criminal sentences because they believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they acted on it , \u201d Cheney said .\n\u201c They came to Washington , D.C. , at his request , they marched on the Capitol at his request , and hundreds of them besieged and invaded the building at the heart of our Constitutional Republic .\n\u201c The select committee will hold its next hearing Wednesday at 10 a.m .\nET .", "author": "Kristen Doerer", "url":

hearing Thursday .\nInvestigators said that Trump and his allies pursued an unlawful plan to have former Vice President Mike Pence overturn the 2020 election\u2014and that Trump knowingly put Pence in danger when he refused to do so .\nSelect committee vice chair Rep. Liz Cheney said that the committee is outlining a seven-part plot by Trump and his allies to overturn the will of the voters .\nLast week , the committee looked at the violence committed on Jan. 6 and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boys and the Oath Keepers to overturn the election .\nOn Monday , the committee brought forth evidence that Trump knew his stolen-election claims were false and perpetuated them among his followers anyway .\nIn Thursday \u2019 s hearing , investigators examined the role of John Eastman , a lawyer who provided Trump with the false legal theory that the vice president , who presides over the counting of the electoral votes in a ceremonial capacity , had the authority to either : declare a 10-day recess and send electoral votes back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electors and essentially declare Trump president .\nTrump wanted Pence to reject the electors outright when Congress certified electoral votes on Jan. 6 .\nPence refused to bow to the pressure .\nHere are the five main takeaways from the hearing .\nTrump lawyer John Eastman peddled a theory that the vice president could have the authority to overturn the election .\nHe knew his theory was false .\nEastman is known as the author of the \u201c coup memo.\n\u201d A lawyer with the ultraconservative Claremont Institute , he wrote a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 12th Amendment in which the vice president had the authority to overturn the presidential election .\nTestifying to the committee Thursday , Greg Jacob , Pence \u2019 s chief counsel , recalled a conversation he had with Eastman before on Jan. 5 .\n\u201c Part of my discussion with Mr. Eastman was , if you were right , don \u2019 t you think Al Gore might have liked to have known in 2000 that he had authority to just declare himself president of the United States ?\n\u201d Jacob said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al Gore did not and should not have had that authority at that point in time.\n\u201d But that didn \u2019 t stop Eastman from encouraging Pence to follow the plan .\nAccording to Jacob , Eastman told him in that conversation , \u201c Al Gore did not have a reason to do it in 2000 , Kamala Harris shouldn \u2019 t be able to do it in 2024 , but I think you should do it today.\n\u201d Jacob also said Eastman acknowledged that if they followed the plan it would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9-0 .\nEastman knew this theory had no legal basis .\nThe House select committee got its hands on a draft letter to the president from October 2020 in which this false legal theory was proposed .\nEditing the letter was John Eastman , who eviscerated the argument .\nEastman wrote in track changes , \u201c The 12th Amendment only says that the President of the Senate opens the ballots in the joint session .\n\u2026 nowhere does it suggest that the President of the Senate gets to make the determination on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert said Mike Pence had no authority to overturn the election .\nJudge J. Michael Luttig , a retired federal judge and conservative constitutional expert , told the select committee Thursday , \u201c there was no basis in the Constitution or laws of the United States at all for the theory espoused by Mr. Eastman at all.\n\u201d Luttig , who once employed Eastman as a clerk , had advised Pence against following Trump \u2019 s order to overturn the election .\nAfter Trump began pressuring Pence to overturn the election , Pence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all angles .\nTheir conclusion ?\n\u201c There is no justifiable basis to conclude that the Vice President has that kind of authority , \u201d Jacob told the committee .\nThat opinion was shared by others in the Trump White House .\nJason Miller said that Trump White House counsel \u201c Pat Cipollone thought the idea was\u2014was nutty , and had at one point confronted Eastman basically with the same sentiment.\n\u201d White House counsel Eric Herschmann was blunt with Eastman .\n\u201c Are you out of your f-ing mind ?\n\u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c You \u2019 re going to turn around and tell 78-plus million people in this country that your theory is , this is how you \u2019 re going to invalidate their votes , because you think the election was stolen ?\n\u201d Trump launched a public pressure campaign on Pence despite being told repeatedly his plan to overturn the election was unconstitutional .\nDespite his White House counsel and Pence \u2019 s legal team finding the plot unconstitutional , Trump launched a public pressure campaign on Pence .\nHe tweeted repeatedly ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through for the American people and have the \u201c courage \u201d to overturn the election results .\nWhile the public pressure campaign raged on , Trump began pressuring Pence in private meetings .\nDuring a meeting on Jan. 4 between Trump , John Eastman , Pence , Marc Short , the chief of staff to the vice president , and Jacob , Eastman floated his theory again .\nThe vice president \u201c never budged from the position \u201d and did not agree with Eastman , Jacob said .\nOn the morning of Jan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who overheard the president said he became increasingly angered and that he called Pence a \u201c wimp.\n\u201d During an email exchange between Jacob and Eastman on Jan. 6 , Jacob asked if Eastman had advised \u201c the President that in your professional judgment , the Vice President does not have the power to decide things unilaterally ?\n\u201d \u201c He \u2019 s been so advised , \u201d Eastman replied .\n\u201c But you know him .\nOnce he gets something in his head , it \u2019 s hard to get him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pence , Trump was upset with his vice president for refusing to go along with his unconstitutional plan .\nHe let the crowd on the Ellipse know it , too .\n\u201c And Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us , and if he doesn \u2019 t , that will be a sad day for our country .\nBecause you \u2019 re sworn to uphold our Constitution , \u201d Trump told the crowd .\nWhen the mob stormed the Capitol , chants broke out of \u201c Hang Mike Pence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times revealed that Trump \u2019 s chief of staff Mark Meadows , \u201c according to an account provided to the House committee investigating Jan. 6 , then told the colleagues that Mr. Trump had said something to the effect of , maybe Mr. Pence should be hanged.\n\u201d Trump knew Pence was in danger and was aware that the Secret Service had escorted him away from the legislative chambers .\nRather than send a tweet to call off the mob , he sent another criticizing Pence , effectively \u201c pouring gasoline on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .\n\u201c Mike Pence didn \u2019 t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution , \u201d Trump tweeted at 2:24 p.m. Pence and his team came within 40 feet of the mob as the Secret Service took him to a secure location , according to investigators \u2019 findings .\nHe and his team bunkered there for more than four and a half hours until they could return to legislative chambers to finish counting .\nDuring and after the attack on the Capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overturn the election even though he knew his plot was criminal .\nAs the mob attacked the Capitol , Jacob emailed Eastman .\n\u201c Thanks to your bulls**t , we are now under siege , \u201d he told Eastman .\nEastman replied by saying , \u201c the siege is because you and your boss [ the VP ] did not do what was necessary.\n\u201d But Eastman wasn \u2019 t done .\nHe again implored Jacob \u201c to consider one more relatively minor violation and adjourn for ten days to allow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the riot , Herschmann said Eastman called him about challenging the election results in Georgia .\n\u201c And I said to him , \u2018 Are

vowing to defend the Constitution \u201c from all enemies foreign and domestic.\n\u201d For the Oath Keepers , the federal government is among those enemies .\nThe ideology of the Oath Keepers has

Jeffrey Clark , an environmental lawyer at the Justice Department who urged Trump to make him attorney general days before the insurrection so that he could drag the Justice Department into Trump \u2019 s schemes .\nClark \u2019 s superiors had resoundingly rejected his plan to have the Justice Department send letters to leaders in battleground states Trump lost , letters that would have falsely claimed that the DOJ had \u201c identified significant concerns \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send pro-Trump electoral votes to Congress .\nBut after being rebuffed by DOJ leaders , Clark went around them to meet directly with Trump\u2014multiple times .\nThree days before the insurrection , Clark urged Trump to name him attorney general .\nOther DOJ officials who had gotten wind of the meeting told Trump that such a move would lead to mass resignations .\nIn the end , Trump blinked .\nThe Washington Post reported this week that Clark also requested an intelligence briefing about \u201c an allegation that the Chinese were controlling US.-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d a wild theory even for Trump \u2019 s stolen-election conspiracists and , not surprisingly , one that the DOJ did not consider credible .\nClark \u2019 s attempted end-run around the Justice Department has been documented by media and the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack .\nClark is expecting more negative attention from the committee , he told Steve Bannon \u2019 s \u201c War Room \u201d podcast after the committee \u2019 s first public hearing last week .\nOn Bannon \u2019 s June 13 show , Clark falsely claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigate his actions because , he said , he had nothing to do with the physical attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6 .\nIn fact , the committee has made it very clear from its inception that its focus is not only on the events of Jan. 6 but also on the related conspiracy to overturn the election that led up to the attack .\nClark has reportedly cited the Fifth Amendment in refusing to answer committee questions .\nBannon told Clark he would have him back on the show to address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Jan. 6 committee hearings .\nBannon isn \u2019 t the only Trumpworld figure rewarding Clark \u2019 s loyalty and apparent willingness to do anything to keep Trump in power .\nThis morning , Center for Renewing America President Russ Vought , a former Trump administration official , announced that his group had hired Clark as a senior fellow to work on \u201c election integrity \u201d and other issues .\nVought was the guy who issued a ban on anti-racism training by federal agencies and contractors in the closing months of the Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy to mobilize angry voters via fearmongering about critical race theory .\nThe Center has helped drive the manufactured anti-CRT panic ; its toolkit has been promoted by the pro-Trump prayer-warriors at Intercessors for America .\nVought has said the election of Virginia Gov .\nGlenn Youngkin was proof of its power as a culture war weapon .\nHere \u2019 s how Vought characterized Clark \u2019 s attempted subversion of the presidential election : He brought up legitimate concerns to President Trump about potential voter fraud in the 2020 Presidential Election .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but one that true patriots should be proud of .\nNow he \u2019 s under intense scrutiny from the January 6th committee .\nIt \u2019 s clear they want to make him a centerpiece of their witch hunt despite the fact that he fought to expose potential voter fraud .\nWe should learn even more about Clark \u2019 s role in Trump \u2019 s bid to retain power in the days ahead .\nThe House select committee is expected to focus one of its upcoming public hearings on actions taken by Trump @ @ @

talking about HUAC , the House UnAmerican Activities Committee , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a question , which was about how we should not be allowing the transgender agenda into our public school , \u201d

From Day Four of the Jan. 6 Hearings", "content": "The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol held its fourth public hearing Tuesday .\nInvestigators laid out how in the months-long effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election , former President Donald Trump and his allies launched a pressure campaign on local election officials and state legislators in battleground states won by Joe Biden to falsely declare the election stolen from Trump .\n\u201c Trump had a direct and personal role in this effort , \u201d Republican Committee Vice Chair Rep. Liz Cheney said in her opening remarks .\nThe committee had four in-person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger ; Gabriel Sterling , a top election official in Georgia ; and Wandrea \u201c Shaye \u201d Moss , an election worker in Fulton County , Georgia .\nEach was either pressured by Trump to change the results or became the victim of his baseless attacks .\nHere are four takeaways from day four of the Jan. 6 public hearings .\n\u2018 We just don \u2019 t have the evidence \u2019 : Trump \u2019 s team couldn \u2019 t provide evidence of voter fraud .\nAmong the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaker Rusty Bowers .\nTrump lawyers John Eastman , Rudy Giuliani , and Jenna Ellis , as well as Rep. Andy Biggs and Trump himself pressed Bowers\u2014who supported and voted for Trump\u2014to remove Arizona \u2019 s electors in favor of those who would vote for Trump .\nBowers repeatedly asked Giuliani and Ellis to provide evidence for their claims that thousands of dead people had voted .\nThey didn \u2019 t provide him that evidence or any other evidence that illegal votes were cast in Arizona .\n\u201c No one provided me such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAt one point , he said , Giuliani even admitted they didn \u2019 t have evidence .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve got lots of theories , we just don \u2019 t have the evidence , \u201d Giuliani told him and other Republicans , according to Bowers .\nDespite Bowers telling Trump he would not decertify electors , Trump lawyer John Eastman called Bowers a few days later , urging him to do just that .\nWhen Bowers asked why he would violate his oath to the Constitution and to Arizona \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastman told him , \u201c Just do it , and let the courts sort it out.\n\u201d Bowers refused to do so .\nTrump was personally involved in the fake-electors plot , even though his own White House counsel said it \u201c was not legally sound.\n\u201d Among the strategies to overturn the election pursued by Trump and his team was an effort to replace a state \u2019 s electors with \u201c alternative \u201d fake electors who would vote for Trump .\nThe committee interviewed Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requested the RNC \u2019 s help in coordinating this effort .\nMcDaniel said that while they were on a conference call , Trump introduced Eastman to talk about convening \u201c contingent electors \u201d in case Trump \u2019 s legal challenges turned a state in his favor .\nMcDaniel said that to her knowledge the Trump campaign took the lead on this effort while the RNC aided the effort .\nAs Trump lost lawsuits , some of Trump \u2019 s campaign lawyers , including Justin Clark and Matt Morgan , began to distance themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe White House counsel \u2019 s office also found the plot to be potentially illegal , according to testimonies by those in the Trump White House .\nEven after he was told clearly and repeatedly that his claims were lies , Trump kept repeating them .\nIn earlier hearings , the committee demonstrated that even after Trump \u2019 s own Justice Department and advisers told him his voter fraud claims were false , Trump continued to repeat these false claims , and that even after his advisers told him his plot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election was unconstitutional , Trump proceeded to pressure Pence .\nDuring Tuesday \u2019 s hearing , we heard how local and state election officials told Trump his claims of voter fraud were blatantly false , and Trump , true to character , continued to repeat them .\n\u201c They said that there was over 66,000 underage voters .\nWe found that there was actually zero , \u201d Raffensperger testified .\n\u201c They said that there was 2,423 nonregistered voters .\nThere were zero .\nThey said that there was 2,056 felons .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were actually still on a felony sentence .\nEvery single allegation we checked , we ran down the rabbit trail to make sure that our numbers were accurate.\n\u201d On one phone call with the president\u2014a recording of which was played during the hearing\u2014Raffensperger pushed back on Trump \u2019 s unsupported claims .\nThe first was that suitcases of ballots were counted for Biden and that Biden votes were counted three times .\n\u201c We did an audit of that and we proved conclusively that they were not scanned three times , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President , we \u2019 ll send you the link from WSB.\n\u201d \u201c I don \u2019 t care about a link .\nI don \u2019 t need it .\nI have a much better\u2014we \u2019 re gon na have a much better link , \u201d Trump replied .\nPrior to that phone call , both the FBI and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation had already proven those specific voter fraud claims to be false .\nNevertheless , Trump would go on to repeat these false claims again\u2014most significantly on the Ellipse on Jan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol .\nElection officials and other public officials faced smears , threats , and harassment as a result of Trump \u2019 s false claims .\nMany are now leaving their jobs , paving the way for election deniers to take their place .\nBoth Raffensperger and Bowers continue to receive threats for standing up to Trump \u2019 s power

conspiracy theorist with the so-called Stop the Steal campaign\u2014had this to say about the Jan. 6 hearings : \u201c Nobody cares , dude !\n\u201d Cernovich had joined former Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon a day before the opening hearing on the June 8 episode of Bannon \u2019 s \u201c War Room \u201d podcast .\nAsked how right-wing media , including the \u201c War Room , \u201d should respond to the Jan. 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or launch counterprogramming\u2014Cernovich offered some counterintuitive advice .\n\u201c Whatever we can do to get Democrats to talk more about Jan. 6 we should do , so whatever gets them hyperventilating , crying\u2014oh , seven people died that day ?\nYeah , they were Trump supporters , \u201d Cernovich said .\nIn fact , five police officers died and about 150 were injured as a result of Trump loyalists \u2019 attack on the Capitol .\nAnother four in the crowd died .\n\u201c But what we don \u2019 t want to lose sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the key for us is to stay on message .\nYeah , a woman was shot in the neck and bled out , \u201d he said .\n\u201c The key to keep in mind is the Democrats look like unserious people , unfit to govern because they \u2019 re hyperventilating over an event they compare to 9/11.\n\u201d Cernovich has since called the hearings \u201c propaganda.\n\u201d Bannon\u2014who was indicted for refusing to respond to a Jan. 6 committee subpoena\u2014referred to the Jan. 6 hearings as a \u201c show trial \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhile major news networks carried the first primetime hearing live on June 9 , Fox aired counterprogramming by Tucker Carlson , who took no commercial breaks less his viewers be tempted to tune into the hearing .\nBut since then , the network has covered the Jan. 6 hearings held in non primetime hours , and network analysts were so moved by Republican testimonies during Tuesday \u2019 s hearing that one said it suggests Trump \u201c may be guilty of a crime \u201d and that it \u201c shows his unfitness \u201d for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sinful .\n\u201c Fox News shows their hand\u2014all in on taking down President Trump\u2014now it \u2019 s out in the open\u2014IF YOU WATCH FOX U ARE ONLY AIDING AND ABETTING THEIR ANTI-TRUMP HATE , \u201d Bannon wrote in a June 21 post on GETTR .\nLast Tuesday , Bannon had Trump lawyer Cleta Mitchell on his show .\nMitchell\u2014who was on the infamous call on which Trump asked Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to find votes for him\u2014lashed out at Raffensperger .\nRaffensperger had testified to the Jan. 6 committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to pressure him to overturn the election results .\n\u201c All Raffensperger cared about was getting good press from the liberal media and having all of the left-wing reporters fawning over him , and that \u2019 s why they were there today , because that \u2019 s his number one priority , \u201d Mitchell claimed .\n\u201c If this was a real committee , they would have another panel of witnesses like me !\n\u201d said Mitchell\u2014who was subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 committee for her role in Trump \u2019 s effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on to call the Jan. 6 committee a \u201c kangaroo committee.\n\u201d Other political operatives involved in the so-called Stop the Steal disinformation campaign to keep Trump in power were clearly watching .\nEd Martin\u2014a mentor to Ali Alexander who was subpoenaed for his role in the so-called Stop the Steal campaign\u2014portrayed the hearings as \u201c pure propaganda , \u201d held \u201c just to destroy Donald Trump.\n\u201d Ali Alexander\u2014the leader of the so-called Stop the Steal campaign with a penchant for violent rhetoric\u2014doubled down on his criticism of former Vice President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d he declared on June 16 , the day after the committee detailed Trump and his allies \u2019 pressure campaign on Pence to illegally overturn the election .\nThe committee also illustrated how this pressure campaign led rioters to call for Pence \u2019 s hanging on Jan. 6 when he refused to do Trump \u2019 s bidding .\n\u201c Mike Pence is WRONG , \u201d

representative of the hope America is to the world , and you see the gay flag ?\nIt \u2019 s like , \u2018 What \u2019 s that ?\nWell , apparently , maybe that \u2019 s the secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 So that \u2019 s just absolutely a horrible thing.\n\u201d Still outraged , Grothman fumed about the House passing legislation that would require federal agencies to standardize the collection of data regarding sexual orientation and gender identity , claiming that the government wants to ask young children about \u201c their sexual preferences \u201d in order to \u201c break down any innocence that the children have.\n\u201d \u201c Every Democrat voted for it\u2014every one of them\u2014requiring on the census or other government forms , surveys that are out there people listing so-called sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grothman said .\n\u201c Can you imagine asking an 8-year-old child , \u2018 What is your sexual preference ?\n\u2019 But that \u2019 s what they want .\nI \u2019 m sure they want it to break down any innocence that the children have .\nBut every Democrat in the House of Representatives voted for it .\nAnd we have to ask what they had in their mind and why they are doing it and why the Democrat Party is so owned by the gay lobby that every single Democrat voted to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4-year-old , a 6-year-old , an 8-year-old , a 10-year-old ought to be asked what their sexual preference is.\n\u2019 It could be like a transgender or whatever .\nIt \u2019 s just another example of the moral decline that is being encouraged by the government.\n\u201d \u201c Morally right now the federal government is kind of act acting to me as if the goal of the United States should be to run down Christianity and run down belief in God , \u201d he concluded .\n\u201c John Adams said that \u2018 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral and religious people .\nWe will fail if we cease to be a moral and religious people.\n\u2019 And I think that \u2019 s why the kingpins in the Democrat Party are pushing this atheistic agenda because they know America will fail if we cease to be a moral and religious nation , and that \u2019 s why they \u2019 re pushing in that direction .\n\u201d", "author":

the circle , Meadows is now a \u201c senior partner \u201d at the Conservative Partnership Institute , which received $ 1 million from Trump \u2019 s PAC shortly after the Jan. 6 committee was created .\nKlukowski had joined the Trump administration \u2019 s Office of Management and Budget in the fall of 2019 .\nAfter the 2020 election , Klukowski was parachuted into the Justice Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheming to drag the DOJ into Trump \u2019 s efforts to overturn the election in key battleground states .\nBlackwell clearly seemed to recognize the bad optics of Klukowski \u2019 s involvement , urging in his email , \u201c As I also mentioned , make sure we don \u2019 t overexpose Ken given his new position.\n\u201d Clark has unwillingly played a starring role in the Jan. 6 committee \u2019 s investigation , which has painstakingly exposed his effort to get Trump to name him acting attorney general .\nClark and others had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia legislators\u2014a letter that Klukowski helped Clark write\u2014falsely claiming that the DOJ had identified major election problems in the state and encouraging them to convene a special session to consider naming a pro-Trump Electoral College slate .\nWhen Clark \u2019 s DOJ superiors blocked his scheme , Trump seriously considered making Clark acting attorney general so he could carry it out , abandoning the plan only after other top Justice Department officials threatened a massive leadership resignation that would swamp news of the letter and define Trump \u2019 s legacy .\nAs Rep. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Klukowski was simultaneously working with Jeffrey Clark to draft the proposed letter to Georgia officials to overturn their certified election and working with Dr. Eastman to help pressure the vice president to overturn the election.\n\u201d In other words , while a battle raged between principled White House and Justice Department officials who were committed to upholding the election results and facilitating a peaceful transfer of power and the defeated president and his power-at-all-costs supporters , current and former FRC leaders were in the trenches with Trump and the would-be election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s attempt to overturn the election is far from the first Blackwell-Klukowski collaboration .\nThey co-authored numerous partisan diatribes in the form of op-eds and books ,

had waived executive privilege .\nBannon \u2019 s team argued that he should not have to stand trial since he has since agreed to testify\u2014an argument the judge presiding over the case dismissed

which Bannon and Trump coordinated to overturn the election results .\nOn Jan. 5 , 2021 , Bannon spoke with Trump twice\u2014once in the morning and once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House call logs that were

.\nThe Republican National Committee\u2014which aided Trump in his plot to stay in power\u2014has spent millions on 17 states to recruit more than 14,000 poll workers and 10,000 poll watchers already , according to the Washington Post .\nWorking with the RNC is Cleta Mitchell , a Trump lawyer who was on the infamous call on which Trump asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \u201c

Meadows ( who sat scrolling through his phone when he heard about threats of violence on Jan. 6 ) , Trump \u2019 s former social media director Dan Scavino ( who spread voter fraud conspiracies on behalf of the tweet-happy president ) , and Ed Corrigan ( who appeared to be busy behind the scenes encouraging Vice President Mike Pence to buck his constitutional duty and overturn the election ) .\nCPI enjoyed a $ 1 million boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nCPI and organizations like it are finding success .\nOne in 5 local election administrators say they are likely to leave their jobs before the 2024 presidential election , according to a survey by the Brennan Center for Justice .\nThese public servants cite politicians attacking \u201c a system that they know is fair and honest \u201d and the stress of the job as the top two reasons for their planned departures .\nMeanwhile , other politicians are running for secretary of state to gain control of their states \u2019 elections .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. Capitol \u2019 s east steps as the anti-government extremist Oath Keepers\u2014of which Finchem claims to be a member\u2014stormed the building .\nThree months later , he announced his

became the Republican nominee in the race for secretary of state .\nAnd in Georgia , Rep. Jody Hice tried to best Trump nemesis Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAdded to this stew : a large dose of violent rhetoric .\nAhead of Jan. 6 , violent rhetoric was widespread on pro-Trump social media and among far-right groups .\nToday , it no longer remains on the fringes but has been embraced by right-wing politicians .\nIn Missouri , former governor Eric Greitens\u2014whose ex-wife has accused him of domestic violence\u2014released a campaign ad for his U.S. Senate bid .\n\u201c Today , we \u2019 re going RINO hunting , \u201d Greitens says in the ad , before bursting through a door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c Get a RINO hunting permit .\nThere \u2019 s no bagging limit , no tagging limit , and it doesn \u2019 t expire until we save our country , \u201d he says .\nHe \u2019 s not the only one seeing red .\nIn Oklahoma , state Senate candidate Jarrin Jackson wants to shoot \u201c godless commies.\n\u201d In February , Arizona state Sen. Wendy Rogers voiced her desire \u201c to build more gallows \u201d in a video address to white nationalists .\nWhen asked by Cheney whether he believed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded the Fifth Amendment , every American \u2019 s right against forced self-incrimination .\nThe recorded testimony , which was shown during the sixth hearing , was shocking , and yet , Flynn is not alone .\nRepublicans are more likely than other Americans to say political violence might be necessary , with four in 10 subscribing to that belief , according to a survey conducted by the conservative American Enterprise Institute shortly after the Jan. 6 attack .\nPerhaps that \u2019 s why , after hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a traitor to the country , so many of the Trump supporters storming the Capitol were keen on hanging the former vice president .\nTrump , as the hearing Thursday revealed , did nothing for 187 minutes while his supporters rampaged through the Capitol , beat police officers , and hunted for Pence , Pelosi , and other members of Congress , all with the goal of preventing the peaceful transfer of power .\nAs we move into the 2022 elections ,

legal appeal against contempt of court sanctions .\nPawlowski had held church services during the height of the pandemic , flouting Alberta \u2019 s COVID-19-related public health mandates .\nLast Friday , the Alberta Court of Appeals ordered Pawlowski and his brother to be reimbursed more than $ 15,000 in fines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In February , prosecutors alleged he incited violence at a trucker convoy protest .\nOn Wednesday \u2019 s show , Ralph played a video of Pawlowski \u2019 s son , Nathaniel Pawlowski , who claimed to have met with Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk and Donald Trump Jr. at a TPUSA event in Florida .\n\u201c In fact , Donald Trump Jr. told me that we should all thank Pastor Artur , and that if everyone stood for freedom like he did , we wouldn \u2019 t be in

accused those who arrested and charged him of wanting to implement a \u201c globalistic order \u201d so \u201c Bill Gates will become the biggest landowner on Earth.\n\u201d Later in the program , Pawlowski peddled the conspiracy theory that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is in fact Fidel Castro \u2019 s son , claiming that Margaret Trudeau was \u201c sleeping around with everyone like

agreed .\nHe then used it as an opportunity to call immigrants crossing the Mexico-U.S. border \u201c bandits , \u201d and to call for politicians to be charged with treason .\n\u201c There were

Christians to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other non-Christians , Pawlowski agreed with another viewer who declared that \u201c Theocracy is better than democracy.\n\u201d \u201c That \u2019 s true , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Theocracy , what that means is that , Theo , from Greek god , is the king and head of state and we know he is a perfect judge , so in [ an ] ideal world , theocracy would be the perfect high because God is honest.\n\u201d He then added that democracy is \u201c not that good at all.\n\u201d \u201c However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , so the second best\u2014and it \u2019 s not that good at all ,

the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax and accusing the grieving parents of the slain children of being paid actors , Jones interviewed Republican congressional candidate Laura Loomer on his show \u201c Infowars.\n\u201d \u201c They think MTG is dangerous\u2014I can \u2019 t wait until you \u2019 re in Congress , \u201d Jones said on his Aug. 8 show , comparing Loomer to his frequent guest , the far-right congresswoman from Georgia , Marjorie Taylor Greene .\n\u201c I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States Congress , \u201d Loomer told Jones .\nLoomer is just one of 119 far-right candidates running in the primaries this election season .\nShe earned former President Donald Trump \u2019 s praise after her 2020 primary victory in Florida \u2019 s 25th Congressional District but was solidly trounced by the Democratic incumbent in that year \u2019 s general election .\nShe has yet to gain the former president \u2019 s endorsement this go round .\nFacing off against longtime Rep. Daniel Webster in Florida \u2019 s 11th Congressional District , Loomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name only\u2014and criticized him for everything from his age to his missed votes in Congress .\nBut that \u2019 s a distraction from what she really sells : bigotry and extremism .\nLoomer hopes to follow the path of extremist candidates like Oregon \u2019 s Joe Kent , who earlier this month beat out Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler , one of 10 Republicans who voted for Trump \u2019 s impeachment after the attack on the U.S. Capitol .\nAround the country , 25 percent of the 119 right-wing extremist candidates identified by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus far .\nRunning far-right candidates against incumbent Republicans was a strategy laid out by Trumpist strategists like Ali Alexander , the leader of the so-called \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d campaign , who promised to primary any Republican whom he viewed as insufficiently loyal to Trump during the former president \u2019 s attempted power grab in 2020 .\nWebster , for his part , is no moderate ; the right-wing lawmaker is the preferred candidate of religious-right groups like the Family Research Council , whose endorsement of Webster cites his voting record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious liberty.\n\u201d Despite Webster \u2019 s conservative credentials , Loomer has lambasted him for missing the House vote on Trump \u2019 s second impeachment .\nShe has also outraised him and , according to the Orlando Sentinel , has \u201c a formidable chance of winning the primary.\n\u201d Whoever clinches the primary on Aug. 23 is heavily favored to win the general election .\nBest known for handcuffing herself to Twitter headquarters after she got booted off the platform for her anti-Muslim comments , Loomer has decided if she can \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she \u2019 d like to spread it in the halls of Congress .\nAnd what kind of hate is that ?\nLoomer has long rallied behind white nationalist figures , spread right-wing conspiracy theories , and promoted disinformation .\nShe proclaimed that she did not care about what happened to Muslims in the 2019 Christchurch shooting in New Zealand , where more than 50 people were murdered by a white supremacist .\nIn March , Loomer joined white nationalist Jared Taylor \u2019 s podcast and told him that she thought her white nationalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nShe switched districts , she said , because Florida \u2019 s 11th District has more white people and she could be more honest about her extreme right-wing views .\nShe went on to praise Taylor \u2019 s \u201c white advocacy \u201d \u2014the preferred term of white nationalists to describe their efforts to secure a nation ruled by white people .\nLoomer is scheduled to speak at Taylor \u2019 s white nationalist American Renaissance conference this November and has promised to speak at Nick Fuentes \u2019 far-right America First Political Action Conference next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the support of other white nationalists .\nFuentes thinks white Americans need to be more racist ; hates democracy ; desires taking away women \u2019 s right to vote and calls for \u201c burning women alive more \u201d ; wants to turn the United States into a Christian fascist country ; and compares himself to Hitler .\nHe offered his endorsement of Loomer last week .\n\u201c This would be the first time one of our own got into Congress , \u201d Fuentes said .\n\u201c People say , \u2018 Well , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a woman .\nWe don \u2019 t support women in office , we don \u2019 t support Zionists.\n\u2019 And that \u2019 s true

fazed by Fuentes \u2019 antisemitic outbursts or his misogyny .\nIn fact , she expressed her adoration for Fuentes .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t care what anyone says , \u201d Loomer wrote on Telegram .\n\u201c I love Nick Fuentes.\n\u201d She thanked Fuentes for his endorsement , urging him to \u201c Keep up the great work !\n\u201d \u201c I would like to reserve the title of # CongressionalGroyper , \u201d she added .\n( The young white men who make up the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as \u201c groypers.\n\u201d ) On Sunday evening , Loomer joined the \u201c Killstream \u201d podcast , hosted by far-right podcaster Ethan Ralph , whose list of credentials include platforming white supremacists like failed congressional candidate Patrick Little , sharing \u201c revenge porn \u201d of his then 18-year-old girlfriend , and attacking a police officer .\nLoomer promised to advance white nationalism and Christian nationalism if elected to Congress .\n\u201c I \u2019 m a really big supporter of the Christian nationalist movement , \u201d Loomer said .\n\u201c I \u2019 m going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m going to fight for white people , I \u2019 m going to fight for nationalist movements.\n\u201d \u201c But there is clearly a war on white people , there is clearly a war on Christianity in this country , \u201d Loomer said .\n\u201c Now , even though I am Jewish , I am going to fight for Christian nationalists .\nAnd I find that most of my friends and most of my allies and most of the people I associate with these days are Christian nationalists.\n\u201d Loomer shared more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Telegram post featuring an article by the white nationalist-promoting website VDARE .\nThe post fearmongered about legal immigration and the racist \u201c great replacement theory \u201d \u2014a belief that white people are being systematically replaced across the Western world by non-white immigrants and Jews .\nSharing a quote from the article , the post read : \u201c One reason legal immigration is particularly dangerous : It is creating an \u2018 overclass \u2019 of skilled immigrants who will leverage their professional success and financial power to greatly hasten white dispossession , and bring about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also seen as dangers to such white nationalists .\nThe article cites former North Carolina Republican Gov .\nNikki Haley as an example of a non-white immigrant who threatens to \u201c accelerate \u201d the \u201c erasing [ of ] America \u2019 s white history.\n\u201d Like other white nationalists , Loomer advocates instituting a 10-year moratorium on both illegal and legal immigration .\nLoomer has the endorsements of key figures in the months-long plan to keep Trump in power , including Trump confidant and fixer Roger Stone and former national security adviser Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes the 2020 election was stolen .\nHer 2020 primary victory party featured a who \u2019 s who of the far-right movement , including Proud

Lutz of the University of Houston published a study in The American Political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of European Writers on Late Eighteenth-Century American Political Thought.\n\u201d The purpose of the study was to identify which writers and sources of ideas were most cited in \u201c the political writings of Americans published between 1760 and 1805.\n\u201d The findings , Lutz reported , was that \u201c there was no one European writer , or one tradition of writers , that dominated American political thought \u201d during that era , but that the Bible was cited most frequently solely because many of the pamphlets included in the research were sermons that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Lutz noted , once the sermon pamphlets were excluded , quotes from the Bible appeared no more frequently than citations of the classical or common law .\nMore importantly , Lutz also noted that when the focus was solely on the public political writings from 1787 to 1788 , when the U.S. Constitution was written and ratified , \u201c the Bible \u2019 s prominence disappears \u201d almost completely .\nTables 4 and 5 illustrate the pattern of citations surrounding the debate on the U.S. Constitution .\nThe items from which the citations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to exhausting the literature written by both sides .\nThe Bible \u2019 s prominence disappears , which is not surprising since the debate centered upon specific institutions about which the Bible had little to say .\nThe Anti-Federalists do drag it in with respect to basic principles of government , but the Federalists \u2019 inclination to Enlightenment rationalism is most evident here in their failure to consider the Bible relevant .\nNot only is the claim that the Bible was the most cited document during the founding era misleading , the very @ @ @

Purposes", "date": "2022-09-09", "source": "rightwingwatch", "title": "14 Bible Verses: How David Barton Misuses History and Scripture for Political Purposes", "content": "There is perhaps nobody more responsible for the widely held belief among right-wing activists that the United States was founded to be an explicitly Christian nation than religious-right pseudo-historian David Barton .\nDespite the fact that Barton \u2019 s misuse and misrepresentation of both American history and the Bible have been well-documented , his work has played a key role in laying the foundation for the Christian nationalist worldview being widely espoused today by Republican leaders and their right-wing political allies .\nRecently , Barton delivered a presentation at Radiant Church in Colorado which provided a helpful example of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false impressions that support his Christian nationalist political agenda .\nIn his presentation , Barton focused on a speech delivered on June 28 , 1787 by Benjamin Franklin during the Constitutional Convention , in which Franklin suggested that those gathered turn to God in prayer for help in drafting the Constitution : The small progress we have made after 4 or five weeks close attendance & continual reasonings with each other \u2014 our different sentiments on almost every question , several of the last producing as many noes as ays , is methinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Human Understanding .\nWe indeed seem to feel our own want of political wisdom , since we have been running about in search of it .\nWe have gone back to ancient history for models of government , and examined the different forms of those Republics which having been formed with the seeds of their own dissolution now no longer exist .\nAnd we have viewed Modern States all round Europe , but find none of their Constitutions suitable to our circumstances .\nIn this situation of this Assembly groping as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , and scarce able to distinguish it when presented to us , how has it happened , Sir , that we have not hitherto once thought of humbly applying to the Father of lights to illuminate our understandings ?\nIn the beginning of the contest with G. Britain , when we were sensible of danger we had daily prayer in this room for the Divine Protection .\n\u2014 Our prayers , Sir , were heard , and they were graciously answered .\nAll of us who were engaged in the struggle must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providence in our favor .\nTo that kind providence we owe this happy opportunity of consulting in peace on the means of establishing our future national felicity .\nAnd have we now forgotten that powerful friend ?\nOr do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance .\nI have lived , Sir , a long time and the longer I live , the more convincing proofs I see of this truth \u2014 that governs in the affairs of men .\nAnd if a sparrow can not fall to the ground without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it probable that an empire can rise without [ H ] is aid ?\nWe have been assured , Sir , in the sacred writings that \u201c except the Lord build they labor in vain that build it.\n\u201d I firmly believe this ; and I also believe that without [ H ] is concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the Builders of Babel : We shall be divided by our little partial local interests ; our projects will be confounded , and we ourselves shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to future age .\nAnd what is worse , mankind may hereafter from this unfortunate instance , despair of establishing Governments by Human Wisdom , and leave it to chance , war , and conquest .\nI therefore beg leave to move \u2014 that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of Heaven , and its blessings on our deliberations , be held in this Assembly every morning before we proceed to business , and that one or more of the Clergy of this City be requested to officiate in that service .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were 14 Bible verses that [ Franklin ] quoted \u201d in this one short speech .\nBarton claims that while Franklin is generally considered to be one of the least religious of the Founding Fathers , he delivered a speech filled with Bible citations , which Barton claims is proof that the Founding Fathers were all deeply religious men who intended to create a Christian nation .\n\u201c If that is the least religious , what does the most religious look like ?\n\u201d Barton asked rhetorically , analogously arguing that even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , someone is the least religious person there but \u201c maybe that just means you \u2019 re 99.6 percent Christian when everyone else is 99.7 [ percent ] .\n\u201d Barton \u2019 s claim that the Founding Fathers were all so deeply knowledgeable of the Bible that Franklin could simply rise and extemporaneously deliver a speech filled with biblical citations is undercut by fact that \u201c a copy of the speech \u201d exists \u201c among the Franklin Papers in the Library of Congress.\n\u201d Barton also intentionally fails to mention that the delegates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heed Franklin \u2019 s call to prayer and adjourned without taking any action on his suggestion .\nAs historian Richard Beeman recounts in his book , \u201c Plain , Honest Men : The Making of the American Constitution \u201c : It is also worth taking a closer look at Barton \u2019 s claim that there were 14 Bible verses quoted in Franklin \u2019 s speech .\nHelpfully , Barton flashed an image on screen listing all of the verses supposedly quoted by Franklin , making it easy to compare his claims to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible quote appears in Franklin \u2019 s speech : \u201c Except the Lord build they labor in vain that build it \u201d is a quote from Psalm 127:1 .\nStrangely , regarding Franklin \u2019 s assertion that \u201c a sparrow can not fall to the ground without his notice , \u201d Barton credits Franklin as quoting two New Testament passages that basically say the same thing .\nWhile it is hard to understand how this one Biblical allusion in Franklin \u2019 s speech can count as two quotes from the Bible , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justifies crediting Franklin with quoting four Bible verses simply for using the word \u201c byword.\n\u201d 1 Kings 9:7 : I will cut off Israel from the land that I have given them , and the house that I have consecrated for my name I will cast out of my sight , and Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples Psalm 44:14 : You have made us a byword among the nations ; the peoples shake their heads at us .\n2 Chronicles 7:20 : I will pluck you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given you , and this house that I have consecrated for my name , I will cast out of my sight , and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples .\nDeuteronomy 28:37 : And you shall become a horror , a proverb , and a byword among all the peoples where the Lord will lead you away .\nBarton is on somewhat firmer ground with some of his other citations , such as Franklin \u2019 s use of the phrases \u201c Father of lights , \u201d which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were in the dark , \u201d which mirrors Job 12:25 , and the reference to the Tower of Babel from Genesis 11 .\nAs for the other four Bible verses Barton lists , we can only guess at what passages from Franklin \u2019 s speech he is citing .\nDaniel 4:17 says that \u201c the sentence is by the decree of the watchers , the decision by the word of the holy ones , to the end that the living may know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets over it the lowliest of men , \u201d which perhaps Barton thinks Franklin was referencing by asserting that \u201c God governs in the affairs of men \u201d ?\nMaybe Barton thinks that Franklin \u2019 s statement that God will \u201c illuminate our understandings \u201d is a reference to James 1:5 : \u201c If any of you lacks wisdom , let him ask God , who gives generously to all without reproach , and it will be given him \u201d ?\nAs for \u201c it is God who executes judgment , putting down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Psalm 75:7 , and \u201c the Lord will keep you from all evil ; he will keep your life \u201d from Psalm 121:7 , we don \u2019 t really know what parts of Franklin \u2019 s speech supposedly quotes this passage .\nRegardless , there are nowhere near 14 Bible verses quoted in Franklin \u2019 s speech ; there was one literal quote , a few allusions , and some language that Barton simply unilaterally decided were Bible quotes because of vague similarities between the two .\nThe most telling thing about Barton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech is that the speech itself was unmistakably religious , as Franklin was overtly urging the delegates at the Constitutional Convention to turn to God in prayer .\nBut that isn \u2019 t enough for Barton , who needlessly exaggerates and misrepresents what actually happened and does so because he is not a historian who is concerned about accuracy , but is instead an ardent religious-right activist who is interested primarily in misusing history and scripture to promote his partisan political worldview .", "author": "Kyle Mantyla", "url":

Wallnau continued .\n\u201c I believe the spirit of God is going to show up in a unique way .\nThey \u2019 re attacking everyone who is a Christian in politics as a Christian nationalist .\nAll the

Simply Cannot Be Trusted", "content": "When the Family Research Council held its annual \u201c Pray , Vote , Stand \u201d summit last week , Christian nationalist pseudo-historian David Barton was given a prime speaking slot , along with dozens of right-wing pastors , activists , commentators , and members of Congress .\nWhile introducing Barton , FRC \u2019 s president Tony Perkins declared that what critics deride as Christian nationalism is simply true American history , and he credited Barton for having \u201c done more than anyone else to help Americans , and Christians in particular , to know their history \u201d \u2014a history that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d by mainstream historians .\nPerkins is correct in noting that nobody has been as influential as Barton in convincing millions of Americans that the United States was founded to be an explicitly Christian nation .\nAnd that is a problem , given that Barton \u2019 s misuse and misrepresentation of both American history and the Bible have been well-documented .\nBarton \u2019 s willingness to misrepresent history and scripture to promote his right-wing political agenda was on display when he spoke at Calvary Church in Moline , Illinois , last Wednesday as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort .\nOne of Barton \u2019 s favorite methods of convincing his audience that America was founded as a Christian nation is to assert that Americans of the founding era were so deeply knowledgeable about the Bible that they referenced it continuously in their writings and speeches .\nThe problem today , Barton insists , is that modern Christians are ignorant of both history and scripture and are thus incapable of recognizing the fact that our founding documents are chock-full of Bible quotes .\nThe irony of this assertion is that it relies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to be effective , as anyone willing to look into the claims Barton makes will inevitably find that he is lying .\nWhile speaking at Calvary Church , Barton trotted out a new example of this technique , when he claimed that first- and second-grade students attending public schools in New Jersey in the early 1800s were required to memorize large portions of the Bible as part of their curriculum .\nIt \u2019 s interesting to go back in those early records and see what was being taught in the schools .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some early schools .\nI want to take in New Jersey .\nAnd in this case , I \u2019 m just going to choose 1816 [ in ] New Jersey .\nThey \u2019 re going to show you what happens with first- and second-graders in New Jersey .\nHere \u2019 s what they say .\nIt says , \u2018 All the scholars of the first and second classes commit to memory portions of the New Testament or Psalms , a lesson of the Catechism , several hymns , and the text of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school in New Jersey , if you \u2019 re in first and second grade , this is what you \u2019 re getting memorize .\nAnd by the way , what are the texts of the preceding Sabbath ?\nThat means whatever Pastor Tim talked about on Sunday , we \u2019 re going to memorize those Bible verses ; so whatever verses he referenced , we \u2019 re going to memorize .\nA public school is doing this ?\nYes , absolutely .\nThis is what public schools did .\nAs we all know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids , and they talked about one of the kids that was really sharp .\nThey said , \u2018 One of the scholars has committed to memory the Book of John , and the first 30 Psalms , together with 119th Psalm.\n\u2019 A [ student ] in first and second grade memorized the Gospel of John , 30 Psalms , and Psalm 119 .\nHe was really sharp .\nThe rest of the kids weren \u2019 t quite so sharp .\nHere \u2019 s what it said about the rest of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory the Gospel of John.\n\u2019 The average kid has memorized the Gospel of John .\nEverybody does that in first and second grade , but we got one kid that added 30 chapters out of Psalms and Psalm 119 .\nReally ?\nCommon for first and second grade is everybody memorizes the Gospel of John ?\nMaybe one in 1,000 Christians today has memorized the Gospel of John , and that was first and second grade stuff back then .\nThanks to the quotations Barton cited , we were able to track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this claim .\nIt was a report from the board of directors of the Free School Association of Elizabeth-Town published in a periodical called The Christian Herald and , predictably , Barton was blatantly misrepresenting it .\nThe first thing one notices upon reading the report is that the reference to \u201c the scholars of the first and second classes \u201d does not refer to what today would be called first and second graders .\nThe report explicitly states students are \u201c divided into seven classes \u201d based upon their reading and writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children in the fifth class were unable to read when they entered school.\n\u201d It is unlikely that first- and second-graders were memorizing entire books of the Bible , as Barton claimed , while fifth-graders were unable to read .\nBut more importantly , the document further reveals that this was not a public school at all , as Barton claimed , but rather a Sunday school .\nAs it notes , the students were \u201c taught on the Lord \u2019 s day , immediately after the conclusion of public worship in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself confirms that these students were enrolled in Sunday school when it notes the existence of \u201c two other Sunday schools \u201d that were not under the board \u2019 s control .\nAs author James J. Gigantino II explained in his book , \u201c The Ragged Road to Abolition : Slavery and Freedom in New Jersey , 1775-1865 , \u201d the Free School Association of Elizabeth-Town grew out of the so-called \u201c Sabbath school \u201d movement , in which \u201c schools sponsored by churches and private donors took over black education and continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools were led by white teachers and administrators , focused primarily on reading , writing , and basic mathematics , and taught biblical reading knowledge and prayer to instill religious and moral lessons in their students.\n\u201d From \u201c Church of the Founding Fathers of New Jersey : A History , \u201d a book chronicling the history of the First Presbyterian Church Elizabeth , it is clear that these were indeed Sunday schools set up by Rev .\nJohn McDowell , the author of the document that Barton cited .\nOne of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during John McDowell \u2019 s ministry was the founding of the Sunday School .\nThe first Sunday Schools in America were founded about 1805 in Boston and Philadelphia .\nThe movement spread rapidly to other cities of the country , but not always with success .\nIn many places , the schools were virtually forced upon the church members and the communities , and after a brief trial period , they were abandoned .\nReverend McDowell decided that the idea of founding a Sunday School was good , and used a very cautious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this area .\nHe enlisted the support of his Session , and then contacted Reverend John Churchill Rudd , Rector of St. John \u2019 s Church , and Reverend Thomas Morrell , minister of the Methodist Church , to ask their support .\nBoth men became convinced that the purpose of the proposed Sunday School was good , and the three clergymen began to \u201c sound out \u201d their congregations on the idea .\nThe groundwork was laid in 1812 and 1813 .\nBy the spring of 1814 , enough parents were convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desirable thing , so the school was opened , meeting in the Public Academy located on the north-east corner of the church property .\nPresbyterian , Episcopal , and Methodist children met together , and were taught by the three ministers , at the first sessions .\nAt once the school was a success , and at the end of the first month , it was necessary to open a second school for the Negro children of the town .\nThe colored Sunday School was taught by a student who was studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling itself the Free School Association of Elizabethtown was set up to handle the administration of the Sunday Schools , with Miss Maria Smith as superintendent .\nAccording to professor John Fea , chair of the History Department at Messiah University and author of \u201c Was America Founded as a Christian Nation ?\n, \u201d a search of American newspapers and periodicals published in the early 1800s \u201c clearly show that this is a Sunday School.\n\u201d \u201c This once again shows that Barton fails to understand the larger context of the periods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Fea told Right Wing Watch .\n\u201c It would have taken Barton less than an hour , with the historical databases available to professional historians , or even just a search on Google Books , for him to dig up multiple primary sources showing that the \u2018 Free School Association of Elizabeth-Town \u2019 was , in fact , a Sunday School .\nIn fact , \u2018 public schools \u2019 as we know them today did not exist in the early decades of the 19th century .\nThis is the kind of sloppy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change over time\u2014that has characterized Barton \u2019 s entire career as a Christian Right activist who raids the past for something useful to help him advance his political agenda in the present.\n\u201d We need your help .\nEvery day , Right Wing Watch exposes extremism to help the public , activists , and journalists understand the strategies and tactics of anti-democratic forces\u2014and respond to an increasingly aggressive and authoritarian far-right movement .\nThe threat is growing , but our resources are not .\nAny size contribution\u2014or a small monthly donation\u2014will help us @ @ @ @ @

false claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed \u201d news : the insurrection was led by antifa activists who had been bused in by the FBI to infiltrate a peaceful rally .\nNot everyone was on message : The morning after the insurrection interrupted but failed to stop congressional certification of Joe Biden \u2019 s election , the Dove Christian television network \u2019 s morning news program featured

\u200bclaims that anti-fascist activists , not Trump supporters , were responsible for the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol .\nAbout half of white evangelical Protestants \u201c said the antifa

Trump \u2019 s Big Lie alive , claiming in spite of all evidence that he was the legitimate winner of the election as many of them had prophesied .\nAnd many have rallied around a wave of voter-suppression legislation pushed by Trump Republicans around the country\u2014legislation that disproportionately targets voters of color\u2014and whose proponents justify it by pointing to the Big Lie \u2019 s success at sowing mistrust about election results .\nBy portraying the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil , and claiming that the defeat of God \u2019 s favored candidate\u2014Trump\u2014would mean the end of religious liberty and the criminalization of Christianity , religious-right leaders fostered the sense that the end justified any means to keep Trump in power .\nTrump Republican officials , their political allies , and far-right activists from former White House aide Steve Bannon to white nationalist Nick Fuentes , invoked Christian nationalist language to fire up their followers .\nThis fall , Christian nationalists have rallied around candidates like Doug Mastriano , the Republican nominee for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinesh D \u2019 Souza \u2019 s widely debunked \u201c 2000 Mules \u201d movie and its claims to \u201c prove \u201d widespread voter fraud , and they have embraced the voter suppression and intimidation efforts that have been inspired by that propaganda .\nIt is important to note that many Christians , including some conservative Christians , reject the political ideology of Christian nationalism and the ways it has been enfolded into Trump \u2019 s MAGA movement .\nScholars have documented that Americans who hold strongly Christian nationalist views are also more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be justified in the pursuit of political goals .\nThat explains why Samuel Perry and Philip Gorski , authors of \u201c The Flag and the Cross , \u201d describe Christian nationalism as \u201c a fundamental threat to democracy.\n\u201d And it is why People For the American Way \u2019 s Right Wing Watch continues to document the threats posed by Christian nationalism , sound the alarm about the potential for future right-wing coup attempts , and give people tools to defend democracy , pluralism , and freedom .", "author": "Peter Montgomery", "url":

"source": "rightwingwatch", "title": "Barton\u2019s Bible Bunk: More Evidence of How David Barton Misuses History and Scripture for Political Purposes", "content": "Earlier this month , we published a piece exposing how religious-right pseudo-historian David Barton routinely misrepresents history and scripture to support his Christian nationalist political agenda .\nIn that case , we examined how Barton distorted a speech delivered by Benjamin Franklin during the Constitutional Convention to claim that it was filled with Bible verses .\nAs we have explained before , one of Barton \u2019 s favorite methods of convincing his audience that America was founded as a Christian nation is to assert that Americans of the founding era were so deeply knowledgeable about the Bible that they referenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf people today are incapable of recognizing all of those Bible verses , Barton asserts , that is just because they are \u201c biblically illiterate.\n\u201d Even though we debunked Barton \u2019 s claim about Franklin \u2019 s speech , he continues to make this false claim in his presentations to churches around the country .\nOn top of that , he recently started citing additional historical speeches and documents that he claims are overflowing with biblical citations .\nHere are just a few of his misleading and grossly exaggerated claims .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberty Coalition conference in Colorado earlier this month , he claimed that Patrick Henry \u2019 s famous \u201c Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death \u201d speech contained multiple Bible quotations , as did a letter written by President George Washington to a synagogue in Rhode Island .\nWe don \u2019 t know the Bible even as much as our least religious Founding Fathers used to know the Bible .\nAnd by the way , other examples , if I take you , for example Patrick Henry , you may be familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberty or Give Me Death.\n\u201d That speech that he gave in the legislature of Virginia\u2014which by the way , the legislature of Virginia met at St. John \u2019 s Church in Richmond .\nSo the legislature is meeting in the church ?\nWhat happened to the separation of church and state stuff we \u2019 re told the Founding Fathers wanted ?\nYeah , the legislature met at the church , and [ Henry ] gave a passionate speech that day , and in that speech that he gave if you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentences long .\nBut the same question [ is ] how many Bible verses ?\nThere were 11 Bible verses .\nHe \u2019 s just rattling off the cuff .\nHe is so frustrated with what the other legislators are doing that he just got up and said , \u2018 Guys , you \u2019 re wrong.\n\u2019 And he just goes into a speech .\nThis is just off the cuff .\nBy the way , these are the verses .\nAnd notice these verses ; I \u2019 m not sure about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet that most people have not memorized Ecclesiastes 9:11 as a favorite Bible verse or Deuteronomy 32 .\nSee these verses here ?\nThese aren \u2019 t the ones that we typically memorize , but this is what they had in their heart , this is what they had memorized , and this is what came out when the time was right and they needed this .\nYou go to George Washington .\nIn 1789 , he becomes president , and in 1790 , he decides , \u201c I need to visit every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ve been separate nations , we need to know that we \u2019 re a nation , so I \u2019 m going to everywhere , every state.\n\u201d And in 1790 , he had plans to go into Rhode Island , and as he was going into Rhode Island , plans were announced that President Washington is going to visit Rhode Island .\nThere \u2019 s a Hebrew congregation in Newport , Rhode Island that wrote Washington a letter , and it was just an effusive letter , it said , \u201c We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve done , what you \u2019 ve done for religious liberty , what you \u2019 ve done for our freedoms , we think God has raised you up , \u201d and they just gushed all over him .\nIt was just a really nice letter .\nAnd so Washington replied back to them , and in reply back\u2014it was a cordial letter , kind of a presidential letter\u2014he said , \u201c Thank you .\nThat \u2019 s really nice.\n\u201d And the letter that he replied back to them in had a total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he quoted 10 Bible verses .\nHis letter to the Hebrew congregation is just about Bible phrase after Bible phrase after Bible phrase .\nThat \u2019 s what he used to craft that reply .\nSo when you look back at Founding Fathers , you find that they knew the Bible , they knew it very well , they studied it well .\nThe first thing worth noting is that the legislature of Virginia did not meet in a church , as Barton claimed .\nHenry delivered his famous speech during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held in St. John \u2019 s Church because the colony \u2019 s royal governor , Lord Dunmore , had dissolved the state \u2019 s House of Burgesses near the start of what eventually became the American Revolution .\nSecondly , Henry \u2019 s speech was not written down or transcribed at the time , and the version of the speech known today was reconstructed from the recollections of witnesses years after Henry had died .\nThus , nobody really knows exactly what Henry said that day .\nRegardless , here is the speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more highly than I do of the patriotism , as well as abilities , of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the House .\nBut different men often see the same subject in different lights ; and , therefore , I hope it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if , entertaining as I do opinions of a character very opposite to theirs , I shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve .\nThis is no time for ceremony .\nThe question before the House is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For my own part , I consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery ; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate .\nIt is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth , and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to God and our country .\nShould I keep back my opinions at such a time , through fear of giving offense , I should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disloyalty toward the Majesty of Heaven , which I revere above all earthly kings .\nMr. President , it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope .\nWe are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth , and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts .\nIs this the part of wise men , engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty ?\nAre we disposed to be of the number of those who , having eyes , see not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation ?\nFor my part , whatever anguish of spirit it may cost , I am willing to know the whole truth ; to know the worst , and to provide for it .\nI have but one lamp by which my feet are guided , and that is the lamp of experience .\nI know of no way of judging of the future but by the past .\nAnd judging by the past , I wish to know what there has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last ten years to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House .\nIs it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received ?\nTrust it not , sir ; it will prove a snare to your feet .\nSuffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss .\nAsk yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and darken our land .\nAre fleets and armies necessary to a work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love ?\nLet us not deceive ourselves , sir .\nThese are the implements of war and subjugation ; the last arguments to which kings resort .\nI ask gentlemen , sir , what means this martial array , if its purpose be not to force us to submission ?\nCan gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it ?\nHas Great Britain any enemy , in this quarter of the world , to call for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , sir , she has none .\nThey are meant for us : they can be meant for no other .\nThey are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British ministry have been so long forging .\nAnd what have we to oppose to them ?\nShall we try argument ?\nSir , we have been trying that for the last ten years .\nHave we anything new to offer upon the subject ?\nNothing .\nWe have held the subject up in every light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been all in vain .\nShall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication ?\nWhat terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted ?\nLet us not , I beseech you , sir , deceive ourselves .\nSir , we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on .\nWe have petitioned ; we have remonstrated ; we have supplicated ; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne , and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slighted ; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult ; our supplications have been disregarded ; and we have been spurned , with contempt , from the foot of the throne !\nIn vain , after these things , may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation .\nThere is no longer any room for hope .\nIf we wish to be free\u2014if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending\u2014if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest

with so formidable an adversary .\nBut when shall we be stronger ?\nWill it be the next week , or the next year ?\nWill it be when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British guard shall be stationed in every house ?\nShall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction ?\nShall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope , until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot ?\nSir , we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power .\nThe millions of people , armed in the holy cause of liberty , and in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us .\nBesides , sir , we shall not fight our battles alone .\nThere is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations , and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us .\nThe battle , sir , is not to the strong alone ; it is to the vigilant , the active , the brave .\nBesides , sir , we have no election .\nIf we were base enough to desire it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retire from the contest .\nThere is no retreat but in submission and slavery !\nOur chains are forged !\nTheir clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston !\nThe war is inevitable\u2014and let it come !\nI repeat it , sir , let it come .\nIt is in vain , sir , to extenuate the matter .\nGentlemen may cry , Peace , Peace\u2014but there is no peace .\nThe war is actually begun !\nThe next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are already in the field !\nWhy stand we here idle ?\nWhat is it that gentlemen wish ?\nWhat would they have ?\nIs life so dear , or peace so sweet , as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery ?\nForbid it , Almighty God !\nI know not what course others may take ; but as for me , give me liberty or give me death !\nAnd here are the Bible verses that Barton claims Henry quoted , as displayed in a slide in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims about Franklin \u2019 s speech at the Constitutional Convention , there are some obvious biblical allusions in Henry \u2019 s speech , such as his assertion that \u201c Gentlemen may cry , Peace , Peace\u2014but there is no peace , \u201d which is a reference to both Jeremiah 6:14 and Jeremiah 8:11 where the phrase appears .\nHowever , it is hard to understand how Henry \u2019 s use of this phrase can count as two biblical citations .\nWhile Henry \u2019 s language that \u201c the battle , sir , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an echo in Ecclesiastes 9:11 , it is hard to determine where the other Bible verses Barton cites supposedly appear in Henry \u2019 s speech : \u2022 Jeremiah 50:22 : The noise of battle is in the land , and great destruction !\n\u2022 2 Chronicles 32:8 : With him is an arm of flesh , but with us is the Lord our God , to help us and to fight our battles .\nAnd the people took confidence from the words of Hezekiah king of Judah .\n\u2022 Daniel 4:17 : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchers , the decision by the word of the holy ones , to the end that the living may know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will and sets over it the lowliest of men .\n\u2022 Psalm 75:7 : but it is God who executes judgment , putting down one and lifting up another .\n\u2022 Joshua 24:15 : And if it is evil in your eyes to serve the Lord , choose this day whom you will serve , whether the gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the River , or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell .\nBut as for me and my house , we will serve the Lord .\n\u2022 2 Thessalonians 1:6 : since indeed God considers it just to repay with affliction those who afflict you .\n\u2022 Deuteronomy 32:4 : The Rock , his work is perfect , for all his ways are justice .\nA God of faithfulness and without iniquity , just and upright is he .\n\u2022 Matthew 20:6 : And about the eleventh hour he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said to them , \u2018 Why do you stand here idle all day ?\nThe same goes for Washington \u2019 s letter to the Touro Synagogue in Rhode Island which , contrary to Barton \u2019 s assertion , is much longer than just two sentences : To the Hebrew Congregation in Newport , Rhode Island While I receive , with much satisfaction , your Address replete with expressions of affection and esteem ; I rejoice in the opportunity of assuring you , that I shall always retain a grateful remembrance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Newport , from all classes of Citizens .\nThe reflection on the days of difficulty and danger which are past is rendered the more sweet , from a consciousness that they are succeeded by days of uncommon prosperity and security .\nIf we have wisdom to make the best use of the advantages with which we are now favored , we can not fail , under the just administration of a good Government , to become a great and a happy people .\nThe Citizens of the United States of America have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to mankind examples of an enlarged and liberal policy : a policy worthy of imitation .\nAll possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship It is now no more that toleration is spoken of , as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people , that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights .\nFor happily the Government of the United States , which gives to bigotry no sanction , to persecution no assistance requires only that they who live under its protection should demean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on all occasions their effectual support .\nIt would be inconsistent with the frankness of my character not to avow that I am pleased with your favorable opinion of my Administration , and fervent wishes for my felicity .\nMay the Children of the Stock of Abraham , who dwell in this land , continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other Inhabitants ; while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and figtree , and there shall be none to make him afraid .\nMay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not darkness in our paths , and make us all in our several vocations useful here , and in his own due time and way everlastingly happy .\nHere are the Bible verses Barton claims are cited in Washington \u2019 s letter , as seen in his slide presentation : Once again , there are a few Biblical allusions in Washington \u2019 s letter , such as his line about \u201c every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and figtree , \u201d which is a reference to language found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which Barton yet again inexplicably counts as two citations .\nWashington \u2019 s language about \u201c the father of mercies \u201d does echo 2 Corinthians 1:3 and the line about \u201c the Stock of Abraham \u201d mirrors Acts 13:26 , but the remainder of the Bible verses cited by Barton are difficult to place : \u2022 Isaiah 35:10 : And the ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with singing ; everlasting joy shall be upon their heads ; they shall obtain gladness and joy , and sorrow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4:18 : But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn , which shines brighter and brighter until full day .\n\u2022 Psalm 119:105 : Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path .\n\u2022 Ecclesiastes 3:11 : He has made everything beautiful in its time .\nAlso , he has put eternity into man \u2019 s heart , yet so that he can not find out what God has done from the beginning to the end .\n\u2022 Ephesians 4:1 : I therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called .\n\u2022 Deuteronomy 12:10 : But when you go over the Jordan and live in the land that the Lord your God is giving you to inherit , and when he gives you rest from all your enemies around , so that you live in safety .\nAs with his claims about Franklin \u2019 s speech , there are nowhere near as many Bible citations in Henry \u2019 s speech or Washington \u2019 s letter as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of what Barton \u2019 s claim are quotes from Bible verses amount to little more than vague similarities in language .\nWhat \u2019 s more is that rather declare this to be an explicitly or exclusively Christian nation , Washington assured his Jewish recipients that \u201c All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship , \u201d and that \u201c happily the Government of the United States \u2026 gives to bigotry no sanction , to persecution no assistance.\n\u201d The irony of Barton \u2019 s complain about modern Christians being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can \u2019 t recognize all of the Bible verses allegedly contained in documents from the founding era is that it is precisely the biblical illiteracy that Barton decries that allows him to get away with routinely misleading his audiences , as he knows they most likely are incapable of detecting his lies and misrepresentations and will never bother to check the baseless assertions that he makes .", "author": "Kyle Mantyla", "url":

have fanaticism needed to burn the existing political and social order to the ground .\nThose who filled the ranks of government under Trump , Fuentes griped , were too concerned about their own lives

Hurricane Ian would make landfall on the Southeast . )\nOver the course of eight hearings held throughout the summer , the committee unveiled new details about the months-long effort by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election culminating in the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 , 2021 .\nUnlike previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little ahead of time about the topic of next Thursday \u2019 s hearing or who is leading the questioning .\nAnd there is some discussion about whether this will be the last hearing or not .\nWhile committee Chair Bennie Thompson has said that this hearing will likely be the last , Vice Chair Liz Cheney has suggested there could be more .\nBut we do know that all nine members of the panel are expected to speak at the next hearing , that a final report is expected to be released before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats could lose control of the House , and that the committee sifted through a wealth of new information over the summer .\nAmong some of the new material Americans may well see next Thursday is footage from a documentary film crew following Roger Stone , Trump \u2019 s longtime confidant and a Republican operative with the so-called Stop the Steal movement .\nAt the end of September , CNN shared footage from that film , \u201c A Storm Foretold , \u201d in which Roger Stone , a day before the election , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election results ; he wants violence .\n\u201c Fuck the voting , let \u2019 s get right to the violence , \u201d Stone says .\nViolent rhetoric was a key element of the so-called Stop the Steal campaign , which falsely claimed voter fraud had stolen he election from Trump .\nIn another clip , Stone says that if the election is up in the air , as he suspects , Trump and everyone need to declare victory .\n\u201c I really do suspect it \u2019 ll still be up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key thing to do is to claim victory .\nPossession is nine tenths of the law .\n\u2018 No , we won .\nFuck you , \u2019 \u201d Stone said on Nov. 1 , 2020 , according to the footage .\nIn a statement to CNN , Stone challenged the accuracy of the film , asking viewers to not believe their own eyes .\nStone \u2019 s call to declare victory despite evidence to the contrary echoes statements made by Steve Bannon , Trump \u2019 s former White House adviser and ally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Election Day whether he was winning or not .\n\u201c What Trump \u2019 s gon na do is just declare victory , right ?\n\u201d Bannon told associates in that Oct. 31 , 2020 , speech .\n\u201c He \u2019 s gon na declare victory .\nBut that doesn \u2019 t mean he \u2019 s a winner .\nHe \u2019 s just gon na say he \u2019 s a winner.\n\u201d Audio from that speech , which was unveiled by Mother Jones , was played at the last hearing .\nAt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheney said the dam had broken and more witnesses had come forward .\nSince then , the committee secured interviews with members of Trump \u2019 s former cabinet to discuss what happened between Jan. 6 and Jan. 20 when Biden took office , as well as Ginni Thomas , a Republican activist and the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas .\nThomas\u2014who had supported the Stop the Steal campaign , communicated with Trump lawyer John Eastman , and urged former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to overturn the election results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still believes the 2020 election was stolen and claimed that she did not speak to her husband about her activism regarding the 2020 election .\nWe may well see more from these testimonies at the Oct. 13 hearing .\nAlready , the committee \u2019 s power of the subpoena has painted a much more detailed picture of the plot conducted at all levels of government by the former president and his allies to hang onto power .\nWhile we knew that Trump had put Vice President Mike Pence in danger ; what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aides that , after hearing the rioters were chanting \u201c Hang Mike Pence , \u201d he thought Pence deserved it .\nShortly after that , he sent out another tweet criticizing Pence , one that his aides described as pouring gasoline on fire .\nMeanwhile , in the Capitol , Secret Service officers guarding the former vice president believed they were in their last minutes ; viewers of the hearing heard radio calls from the officers as they sent messages to loved ones .\nViewers learned that Trump knew that Jan. 6 rallygoers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Capitol anyways .\nViewers learned that Trump instructed Acting Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen to \u201c just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.\n\u201d And those watching the hearings learned that Republican Reps. Mo Brooks , Matt Gaetz , Rep.

districts.\n\u201d Visitors to the project \u2019 s website are greeted with a pop-up urging them to \u201c Report a School Promoting Critical Race Theory.\n\u201d The anti-critical race theory tactic

Kirk Makes Multiple Historically and Biblically Baseless Claims to Justify His Christian Nationalism", "content": "Right-wing commentator and youth organizer Charlie Kirk spoke Monday night at Sunset Avenue Church of God in North Carolina , where he made a variety of historically and biblically baseless claims about why right-wing Christians must be politically engaged .\nKirk , the Christian nationalist founder of Turning Point USA who has millions of followers on social media , spoke with Sunset Avenue \u2019 s pastor Boyd Byerly , who asked Kirk to explain to the audience why it is \u201c important for pastors and church people to get involved and to make a difference in our communities and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , the Bible commands us to do it , \u201d Kirk replied .\n\u201c Jeremiah 29:7 : \u2018 Demand the welfare of the nation that you are in because your welfare is tied to your nation \u2019 s welfare.\n\u2019 Daniel , Esther , Mordecai , Nehemiah , Jeremiah , and others were all counselors to secular government for God \u2019 s purpose .\nSo , unless you want to remove every single one of those people that cared about the government , cared about the political implications , then you \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that say that .\nZechariah 8:16-17 [ contain ] direct orders : demand justice , demand love in my name .\nI \u2019 m paraphrasing the Scripture , but there \u2019 s direct orders of what to do politically.\n\u201d \u201c The Founders had trust in a constitutional style government because they always thought the church would be the counselor to the king , \u201d Kirk claimed .\n\u201c So , that \u2019 s why they didn \u2019 t have to build it into any of the outward mechanisms .\nBy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation of powers , checks and balances , independent judiciary , they \u2019 re all Christian , they \u2019 re all biblical .\nFor example , Isaiah 33:22 \u2026 it basically says God is the king , he \u2019 s the interpreter of laws , he \u2019 s the maker of laws .\nI wonder where that is ?\nOh , you mean the executive branch , the judicial branch , the legislative branch ?\nThe Founding Fathers wrote in the Federalist Papers [ that ] only God should have the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it intentional to separate those three ; the first government in human history ever do that .\nConsent of the governed comes right comes out of Isaiah as well .\n[ An ] independent judiciary comes right out of Leviticus.\n\u201d Let \u2019 s take a look at Kirk \u2019 s claims , such as his assertion that Jeremiah 29:7 commands Christians to be involved in politics makes little sense considering that the biblical passage is actually a command that the Jews in Babylon pray for the city into which they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city where I have sent you into exile , and pray to the Lord on its behalf , for in its welfare you will find your welfare.\n\u201d Similarly , Zechariah 8:16-17 is simply a command to \u201c speak the truth to one another ; render in your gates judgments that are true and make for peace ; do not devise evil in your hearts against one another , and love no false oath , for all these things I hate , declares the Lord.\n\u201d These two passages are hardly explicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be involved in government , much less \u201c direct orders of what to do politically.\n\u201d By the same token , there is no evidence to support Kirk \u2019 s claim that the founders who drafted the Constitution relied on the Bible for the concept of consent of the governed or in establishing checks and balances and an independent judiciary , nor is there any mention in the Federalist Papers of Isaiah 33:22 being the inspiration for the Constitution \u2019 s separation of powers .\nOne has to wonder

\u2019 s unclear whether they will offer any original content there .\nStone streamed his \u201c The Stone Zone \u201d show on the channel last night , as well as on Mike Lindell \u2019 s Frank Speech Platform .\nThis follows the pattern of other streamers on the network , including radical conspiracy theorist Alex Jones , who streams the same content he offers Cozy TV on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones has been welcomed back to more mainstream right-wing media like Fox , Jones was broadly deplatformed from mainstream sites after he falsely claimed the parents of the slain children at Sandy Hook were paid actors , leading to their harassment ; he was recently ordered to pay $ 965 million for his lies .\nNot everyone on Cozy TV who has made it the cesspool that it is appears welcoming to these newcomers .\nKai Schwemmer , a 19-year-old influencer with the white nationalist America First youth movement , lashed out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard \u201c credible \u201d accusations that Alexander is a pedophile .\n( It looks like the right \u2019 s obsession with accusing of people of pedophilia applies to their own as well . )\nAnd while the Christian nationalist Fuentes threw his support behind Laura Loomer , who supports a white ethnostate , during her congressional primary in Florida this summer , calling her \u201c one of our own , \u201d fractures between Loomer and Fuentes have appeared before .\nAfter Fuentes attacked Jews this summer , Loomer , who is Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ally \u2019 s antisemitism , posting on Telegram , \u201c I don \u2019 t understand the obsession some people have with demonizing all Jews.\n\u201d During her second congressional bid , Fuentes also tried to convince his followers that Loomer was OK , even though she is a woman and a Zionist .\n\u201c People say , \u2018 Well , she \u2019 s a Zionist , she \u2019 s a woman .\nWe don \u2019 t support women in office , we don \u2019 t support Zionists.\n\u2019 And that \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she would be the only one out of 530-some congressmen and senators who is going to be fully red-pilled.\n\u201d It \u2019 s unclear how much of an increase in viewership this new cast of characters will see from joining Fuentes \u2019 platform .\nFormer associates of Fuentes have claimed that he manipulates the viewership numbers to make himself appear more popular than he is , though extremist researchers have been unable to confirm the veracity of this allegation .\nIt \u2019 s notable that so many of the far-right activists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election and who called for violence to keep Trump in office would join the same platform .\nA day before the election , Stone was caught on tape saying , \u201c Fuck the voting , let \u2019 s get right to the violence.\n\u201d Stone led the first so-called \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d campaign in 2018 , which falsely alleged fraud and disrupted vote counting in Florida , while Alexander rebooted the campaign in 2020 and urged his followers to take matters into their own hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 , 2021 , after he suggested that his audience could off lawmakers to prevent them from \u201c stealing \u201d the election .\nThough he did not enter the Capitol himself , followers of his America First movement did , including Christian Secour , who was recently sentenced to three years in prison for his role in the insurrection .", "author": "Kristen Doerer", "url":

Milo Yiannopoulos of Sabotaging Her Recent Congressional Campaign", "content": "Far-right activist Laura Loomer appeared on Ethan Ralph \u2019 s \u201c Killstream \u201d program Wednesday , where she accused her one-time friend and ally Milo Yiannopoulos of sabotaging her most recent run for Congress .\nLoomer was ostensibly on Ralph \u2019 s program to discuss her new channel on Cozy TV , an explicitly \u201c anti-gay , anti-woman , anti-Black , antisemitic \u201d streaming platform created by white nationalist Nick Fuentes .\nDuring the discussion with Ralph , who also streams on the Cozy , Loomer was asked about her future political plans .\nEarlier this year , Loomer made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the House of Representatives , losing the Republican primary to incumbent Rep. Daniel Webster .\nLoomer , who still refuses to admit that she lost the race , predicted that Webster will step down before the end of his term and that a special election will be held to replace him .\nLoomer said that she believes that she can win that special election , but noted that not only does she face opposition from the GOP establishment but also from her nominal allies in the America First movement .\nShe called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right-wing enfant terrible whose career imploded after he defended pederasty but who has since rebranded himself as \u201c ex-gay \u201d and militantly Catholic .\nIn this new capacity , Yiannopoulos established close ties to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , orchestrating her appearance at the white nationalist America First Political Action Conference and then interning for Greene \u2019 s congressional office .\nLoomer accused Yiannopoulos of using the connections gained through his internship for Greene to sabotage her congressional campaign and keep her out of Congress .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a lot of high-profile conservatives who worked against me , \u201d Loomer said .\n\u201c For example , you had Milo Yiannopoulos who was openly on Telegram talking about how he was forming coalitions while working in the office of Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene , to form coalitions with the left and the right to try to keep me out of office.\n\u201d \u201c I think it \u2019 s a problem when you have people who are claiming to be America First and promoting this idea that they are supporting and promoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scenes , in their own words , with the left , coalitions of the left , to take down America First candidates , \u201d Loomer added .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a shame that we have people that are so selfish on our side that they \u2019 re willing to actually work with the radical left to sabotage America First candidates.\n\u201d \u201c At what point does the sabotage prevent America First from actually having a true America First fighter in Congress today , fighting for their values and fighting for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are very , very serious issues that we \u2019 re dealing with .\nWe \u2019 re talking about deliberate forms of sabotage to attack and prevent a very viable , popular America First candidate , joining forces with the radical left to prevent the success of an America First candidate who has always been a free speech absolutist and has always been extremely pro-Trump .\nAnd so I find that to be extremely problematic.\n\u201d Loomer sent Ralph screenshots of messages that Yiannopoulos had allegedly posted on the social media platform Telegram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gets nowhere near the Capitol.\n\u201d Later in the livestream , fellow far-right activist Ali Alexander , leader of the so-called \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d movement , called in to vouch for Loomer and support her allegations , saying that Yiannopoulos is a washed-up has-been who turns against his friends when he begins to fear that they might have success without needing to rely on him .\nThese attacks prompted Yiannopoulos to send a message to Ralph in response : Laura has an impeccable track record of failure : failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and failure to win elections .\nHer behavior turns allies into enemies .\nNo one can stand to be around her for long .\nIt \u2019 s beneath my dignity to debate or converse with her in any fashion , but I \u2019 d be open to boxing her at RalphMania ;

"source": "rightwingwatch", "title": "How the Right Is Sowing Doubt in Our Elections", "content": "As voters head to the polls today , a right-wing campaign to sow doubt in the 2022 midterms is underway .\nSince former President Donald Trump lost the 2020 election and tried to overturn the election results by alleging voter fraud , the GOP has fallen in line behind him , making so-called \u201c election integrity \u201d a key component of its platform .\nNearly 300 Republicans who have denied the results of the 2020 election are running for office this year , and many refuse to say whether they will accept the results of their elections should they lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the groundwork by fearmongering about widespread voter fraud , with groups like True the Vote catapulting their voter fraud conspiracy theories to propaganda hits .\nPerhaps no one was so blunt as to what all of this election denialism means as Ali Alexander , the leader of the so-called Stop the Steal campaign , which after Trump \u2019 s loss in 2020 , worked to overturn the election .\n\u201c Any election I don \u2019 t like is stolen , \u201d Alexander said during a livestream last week .\n\u201c If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s stolen .\nIf I like it , it \u2019 s not stolen .\nIf you win , it \u2019 s stolen.\n\u201d Election deniers running for office are playing by the same rules .\nIn Arizona , Kari Lake built her gubernatorial campaign on denying the results of the 2020 election .\nWhen asked if she would accept an election in which she lost , Lake said she wouldn \u2019 t lose .\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to win the election , and I will accept that result , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arizona will never support and vote for a coward like Katie Hobbs.\n\u201d As the New York Times noted , this sets \u201c up a framework in which , if Ms. Hobbs were to win , Ms. Lake could present the result as evidence of election fraud.\n\u201d As they did in 2020 , the GOP and right-wing activists are honing their voter fraud fearmongering in battleground states .\nIn Michigan , Republican Party operatives have partnered with activist groups in recruiting and training partisan poll watchers , who have been primed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge election results .\nPolitico reported that the Republican National Committee has put these poll workers in direct contact with Republican Party lawyers , even equipping poll workers with a hotline and website \u201c to live-chat with party attorneys on Election Day.\n\u201d As of May , more than 5,600 people had signed up to be poll workers , according to audio recordings obtained by Politico .\nThis wouldn \u2019 t have been possible without the harassment of existing polls workers , who faced baselessly accusations that they counted illegal ballots for Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to widespread quitting , with 1 in 5 election workers saying they plan to leave their jobs before the 2024 presidential cycle , according to the Brennan Center .\nThis harassment came from those at the very top .\nIn one instance in 2020 in Fulton County , Georgia , Trump and Rudy Giuliani pointed to a security video of poll workers and began a conspiracy theory alleging that election worker Shaye Moss and her mother stole the county for Biden .\nMoss received hundreds of threats and quit her job .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many of the election workers shown in a security video were still working , Moss said none : \u201c There is no permanent election worker or supervisor in that video that \u2019 s still there.\n\u201d This summer , Fulton County sought to fill 2,000 poll worker positions .\nElection officials in battleground states are more likely to receive threats , according to the Department of Justice .\nThe DOJ found that 58 percent of potentially criminal threats were directed at poll workers in states that underwent 2020 post-election lawsuits , recounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arizona , Colorado , Michigan , Pennsylvania , Nevada , and Wisconsin .\nAttacks on vote by mail\u2014which was widely used during 2020 , especially among Democrats who wanted to avoid COVID-19\u2014have also remained constant .\nBefore Election Day in 2020 , Trump fearmongered about mail-in ballots .\nGOP candidates and right-wing activists have done same ahead of this year \u2019 s midterm elections .\nTrue the Vote partnered with Dinesh D \u2019 Souza for the propaganda flick \u201c 2000 Mules \u201d which alleged mass voter fraud by voters who dropped off more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( referred to as \u201c mules \u201d in the film ) .\nDropping off ballots for family members is legal in many states , and the film was widely discredited , but \u201c 2000 Mules \u201d and its looney claims took MAGA world by storm .\nAs Right Wing Watch \u2019 s Peter Montgomery reported , this film got the attention of far-right \u201c constitutional \u201d sheriffs , who have partnered with True the Vote .\nThese sheriffs , who believe they are above federal law , have vowed to investigate any instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s not just sheriffs whom voters may be intimidated by .\nIn Arizona , armed men with the group Clean Elections USA patrolled drop boxes , believing them to be a source of electoral fraud .\nLast week , a judge ordered the men to move their patrols more than 75 feet away from ballot boxes , to not carry weapons , and to not to speak to voters .\nVoter advocacy groups had filed a temporary restraining order , saying such patrols were an attempt to \u201c bully and intimidate lawful Arizona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail-in or absentee ballots in Michigan and Pennsylvania , where two lawsuits seek to prevent some mail-in ballots from being counted .\nIn Pennsylvania , Republicans have asked that mail-in ballots with incomplete or wrong dates not be counted despite being received on time .\nThe state supreme court ruled in the Republicans \u2019 favor , causing voters across the state to rush to fix their mail-in ballots .\nMeanwhile , in Michigan , Kristina Karamo , the Republican nominee for secretary of state , launched a lawsuit calling for tens of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , majority Democratic city\u2014to be disqualified .\nOn Tuesday , a Wayne County judge dismissed the lawsuit and had some harsh words for the Republican candidate .\n\u201c Plaintiffs \u2019 failure to produce any evidence that the procedures of this November 8th election violate state or federal election law demonizes the Detroit City Clerk , her office staff , and the 1,200 volunteers working this election .\nThese claims are unjustified , devoid of any evidentiary basis and can not be allowed to stand , \u201d the judge wrote in his decision .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is expected to , she will likely point to mail-in ballots in Detroit and say that the allowance of such votes \u201c stole \u201d the election from her .\nAnd as they did in 2020 , the right is likely to weaponize the \u201c red mirage , \u201d the appearance that Republicans are ahead on Election Day because in-person votes get counted first and Republicans more than Democrats vote in person .\nWhen White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre cautioned against expecting all of the results on election night , The Blaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was evidence of a plot .\n\u201c They \u2019 re really gon na try to steal this thing aren \u2019 t they ?\n\u201d he said in response in a tweet that \u2019 s garnered more than 17,500 likes as of publication .\nRubin wasn \u2019 t the only one .\nAt Fox News , hosts dismissed the idea that ballots counted after Election Day mattered , Media Matters reported .\n\u201c Don \u2019 t listen to the lies they \u2019 re spewing that this could take days or days , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fox host Jesse Watters said on the eve of Election Day .\n\u201c This is total B.S .\nA wave like this , we should know that night , basically , who won the Senate and the House .\nAnything that happens Wednesday into Thursday is gravy.\n\u201d And Steve Bannon told his listeners on the eve of the election that mail-in ballots are a \u201c scam \u201d and that results that don \u2019 t come in on Election Day is \u201c how they steal it.\n\u201d In states where right-wing groups have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant contestations could delay the counting of votes more than normal .\nThis , of course , will be used by right-wing activists like Bannon to cry fraud .", "author": "Kristen Doerer", "url": "https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/how-the-right-is-sowing-doubt-in-our-elections/", "published": "Tue, 08 Nov 2022 21:43:02

"date": "2022-11-07", "source": "rightwingwatch", "title": "Former RNC Faith Outreach Director Chad Connelly Is Spreading False History", "content": "Christian nationalist pseudo-historian David Barton has been traveling across the nation for months , delivering presentations in churches to mobilize conservative Christian voters for the midterm elections .\nThe tour was orchestrated by a religious-right organization called Faith Wins , which is run by former Republican National Committee faith outreach director Chad Connelly .\nDuring these presentations , Barton has repeatedly spread disinformation regarding the Bible and the role it played in the creation of our form of government , and he has done so deliberately in order to promote his right-wing political worldview .\nIt appears as if all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to him willfully spread this disinformation has rubbed of Connelly , who is now doing it himself .\nOn Saturday , Connelly appeared on the \u201c Firewall with Lance Wallnau \u201d program hosted by Christian nationalist Lance Wallnau , where he repeated some of the historical and biblical falsehoods promoted by Barton and then added a few of his own , just for good measure .\nConnelly kicked things off by regurgitating Barton \u2019 s false claim about a speech that Benjamin Franklin delivered during the Constitutional Convention in which Franklin suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer for help in drafting the Constitution .\nIn Barton \u2019 s ( and Connelly \u2019 s ) telling , Franklin cited 14 Bible verses in his short speech ; a claim that Right Wing Watch debunked just two months ago .\nBut Connelly took things a step further by baselessly asserting that the Constitutional Convention then \u201c had three days of prayer and fasting \u201d following Franklin \u2019 s speech \u201c and that \u2019 s where they hammered out the discussion that became the Constitution.\n\u201d They did nothing of the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convention took no action on Franklin \u2019 s suggestion , leaving Franklin disappointed that the convention \u201c thought prayer unnecessary !\n\u201d But Connelly wasn \u2019 t done , as he went on to falsely claim that there are multiple references to God in the Constitution ( there aren \u2019 t ) , before asserting that George Washington cited the Bible in refusing to become king .\n\u201c They wanted to make [ Washington ] a king , and he quoted Jeremiah 17:9 , \u201d Connelly claimed .\n\u201c He said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above all things , only God can judge .\nWe were just coming from a kingdom .\nWe don \u2019 t want a king .\nIf I were a perfect man , and I \u2019 m not , will the next man be a perfect man or the next or the next ?\n\u2019 He quoted scripture to deny them making him a king.\n\u201d What actually happened was that in 1782 , Washington received a letter from a man named Lewis Nicola , who had served in the Continental Army under Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility that the army , upset about not having been paid by the Continental Congress , might refuse to disband at the end of the war , creating a crisis that could potentially tear the new nation apart .\nInstead , Nicola proposed that the Congress grant western lands to those who had served during the Revolution , which they could then use to create a country of their own .\nThis country , Nicola proposed , would be ruled by a king of their choosing ( presumably Washington ) .\nWashington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicola for even proposing such an absurd idea : With a mixture of great surprise & astonishment I have read with attention the Sentiments you have submitted to my perusal .\nBe assured , Sir , no occurrence in the course of the War , has given me more painful sensations than your information of there being such ideas existing in the Army as you have expressed , & I must view with abhorrence , and reprehend with severity\u2014For the present , the communication of them will rest in my own bosom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shall make a disclosure necessary .\nI am much at a loss to conceive what part of my conduct could have given encouragement to an address which to me seems big with the greatest mischiefs that can befall my Country .\nIf I am not deceived in the knowledge of myself , you could not have found a person to whom your schemes are more disagreeable\u2014at the same time in justice to my own feeling I must add , that no man possesses a more sincere wish to see ample Justice done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as far as my powers & influence , in a constitution [ al ] way extend , they shall be employed to the utmost of my abilities to effect it , should there be any occasion\u2014Let me [ conj ] ure you then , if you have any regard for your Country , concern for your self or posterity\u2014or respect for me , to banish these thoughts from your Mind , & never communicate , as from yourself , or any one else , a sentiment of the like nature .\nNowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17:9 or any other scripture , nor can we find any evidence of Washington ever citing this passage in connection with an offer to make him king .\nIf such a citation existed , we are certain that David Barton would be referencing it endlessly .\nSo , considering that we \u2019 ve listened to thousands of hours of Barton \u2019 s presentations and have never heard him make any claim along these lines , we can only conclude that Connelly , like Barton , is \u201c an ardent religious-right activist who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promote his partisan political worldview .\n\u201d", "author": "Kyle Mantyla",

rights into their state constitutions , and in Kentucky , voters rejected a measure that would have prevented that right from being enshrined in that state \u2019 s constitution .\nAs of Monday , Democrats retain control of the Senate .\nThe House still remains undecided , with 17 races to be called .\nAnd though it appears likely Republicans will gain control of the House , it will be a

defeated by voters , some right-wing leaders are predictably calling for new restrictions on early voting and mail-in ballots , both of which have increased access to the ballot and expanded as safe ways for people to vote during the COVID-19 pandemic .\nAmong those calling for limiting early and mail-in voting is the Family Research Council \u2019 s Ken Blackwell , a notorious voter suppresser during his tenure as Ohio secretary of state , who in 2020 participated in former President Donald Trump \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pence to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power after Trump \u2019 s loss .\nAn article published Tuesday by FRC \u2019 s \u201c news \u201d outlet , The Washington Stand , said Blackwell called it \u201c crazy \u201d to depend on vote by mail and said he would end early voting if he could .\nIn a conversation with FRC \u2019 s Tony Perkins two days after the election , Blackwell declared himself \u201c a 21st Century Luddite \u201d and said he wanted to ditch voting machines for paper ballots and restrict voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perkins agreed that voting by mail and longer election periods create greater ballot security challenges and more opportunities for human error .\n\u201c The Democrats want that type of a process , \u201d Perkins claimed .\nBlackwell agreed , saying , \u201c What they figure is that if you have enough confusion , if you have tight margins , you get vote counts in what I call the area of litigation.\n\u201d In reality , election experts and studies have shown that vote by mail is safe and reliable .\nWhile making insinuations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that there were fewer reports of \u201c shenanigans \u201d this year , thanks in part , they said , to having additional observers at the polls .\nPerkins said the two political parties have worldviews that are 180 degrees apart , claiming that \u201c Our freedoms , our abilities to raise our families , to teach our children to love the Lord and to know him and to live that faith out in the broader society is at risk in every election.\n\u201d Blackwell agreed , adding , \u201c We know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that God is at the center , is central to it , and all of the totalitarian states that I have ever visited , they tried to run God and faith out of the public square , crush the family , and make people more dependent , not free citizens but subjects.\n\u201d Speaking about the midterm elections , Blackwell said that it may not have been a red tsunami , but there were major victories for right-wing candidates .\n\u201c We can not let the devil steal our joy , \u201d he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paraphrasing Pastor Gary Hamrick : \u201c Hey , we saw Roe overturned , and we didn \u2019 t expect some kind of backlash from the devil ?\n\u201d \u201c I think the reason people are opposed to very practical procedures such as a photo ID is because they want to cheat the system , \u201d Perkins said .\n\u201c They want to be able to manipulate it.\n\u201d To be fair , Perkins and Blackwell know something about cheating the system and creating confusion .\nBoth energetically embraced and promoted Trump \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 2020 , they signed a letter falsely claiming , \u201c There is no doubt President Donald J.

same-sex couples \u2019 marriages even if the far-right Supreme Court majority overturns the court \u2019 s 2015 marriage equality ruling .\n\u200bAnd like clockwork , anti-LGBTQ activists put their fearmongering about the Respect for Marriage Act into high gear .\nBefore we dig into some of the dishonest and inflammatory claims about\u200b the proposed legislation from opponents of marriage equality , let \u2019 s acknowledge two truths .\nFirst , the religious liberty protections in the compromise bill are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a dozen Republican senators and the socially conservative Mormon Church .\nThink about that when anti-equality politicians claim that the bill \u2019 s supporters are waging war on religious freedom .\nSecond , anti-LGBTQ\u200b leaders \u200bhave sounded false alarms about equality legislation for decades\u2014but their dire predictions about freedom disappearing as LGBTQ people make strides toward legal equality have failed to materialize .\nConsider , for example , the frenzied opposition to the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd , Jr .\nHate Crimes Prevention Act , which passed Congress in 2009 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama .\nThe legislation strengthened an existing federal hate crimes law by including crimes motivated by a victim \u2019 s actual or perceived gender , sexual orientation , gender identity , or disability .\nIf the apocalyptic warnings from far-right religious and political leaders during debate on the bill had any grounding in truth , the years since then would have brought about the criminalization of Christianity , prisons filled with pastors who preached against homosexuality , and conservative Christians piled into boxcars and sent to concentration camps .\nInfluential Christian nationalist \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told a California church that sponsors of the hate crimes law\u2014which explicitly targets violent crimes\u2014wanted to make it a federal crime for preachers to read Bible verses denouncing homosexuality .\nReligious-right leaders and far-right members of Congress falsely claimed , without the slightest evidence , that the law would create legal protections for bestiality and pedophilia .\nMore than a decade later , of course , none of that has happened .\nNo preachers were dragged from their pulpits .\nFar-right Christian leaders are still quite free to rage against legal equality for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free to run political campaigns that smear us with dishonest propaganda .\nFreedom has survived , and the campaign against the federal hate crimes law has been exposed as a lie .\nBut old habits are hard to break , as the all-too-familiar rhetoric from religious-right leaders this week made clear : \u2022 In spite of the historic support for the Respect for Marriage Act from the Mormon Church , Sen. Mike Lee of Utah dismissed the bill \u2019 s religious liberty provisions , telling the Family Research Council \u2019 s Tony Perkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the destruction of religious liberty in America.\n\u201d \u2022 Sean Feucht , the missionary musician turned \u200bright-wing political activist , warned \u200bthe church to \u201c Prepare For Persecution !\n\u201d and claimed that passage of the bill would signal \u201c an attack on the church.\n\u201d \u2022 Liberty Counsel , a religious-right legal group that branched out into anti-vaccine conspiracy mongering during the COVID-19 \u200bpandemic , may take the cake \u200bfor most desperate-to-get-clicks claim that \u201c This Depraved Law Would Allow Pedophiles to Marry Children.\n\u201d \u200bThat claim was given a boost by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberty University \u2019 s Standing for Freedom Center warned that the legislation \u201c disrespects the religious liberties of millions of Americans who may face judicial assault if they refuse to oblige the left \u2019 s tyrannical narratives.\n\u201d The Freedom Center \u2019 s Ryan Helfenbein retweeted its claim , adding his own warning that \u201c We are opening the door for massive religious persecution on a scale never seen before in America.\n\u201d \u2022 Concerned Women for America called it an \u201c attack \u201d on people \u201c who affirm Biblical morality when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pundit Todd Starnes denounced the Republican senators who \u201c just declared war on the church \u201d by voting to allow the bill to move forward , and he claimed that the bill would \u201c put a target on every Christian church in America.\n\u201d \u2022 Under the utterly false headline , \u201c Mitt Romney pushes Polygamy on all 50 states , \u201d religious-right activist and former Colorado state legislator Gordon Klingenschmitt claimed that the bill would \u201c legalize Polygamy , child-marriage , and Gay \u2018 Marriage \u2019 in all 50 states.\n\u201d The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c think tanks , \u201d deserves special mention .\nHeritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts railed against the \u201c betrayal \u201d by the 12 Republican senators who voted to allow the bill to be considered , claiming the legislation \u201c will weaponize the federal government against believers of every major religion.\n\u201d In addition , the Heritage Foundation published a Twitter thread remarkable for its disingenuousness .\nIt insists that the Obergefell decision and legal recognition of same-sex couples \u2019 marriages are \u201c not at risk.\n\u201d In fact , the Heritage Foundation itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be overturned and laid out a strategy for making it happen\u2014and that was before Trump \u2019 s far-right justices joined the Supreme Court and Justice Clarence Thomas urged the Court to overturn the decision .\nEven the American Family Association \u2019 s Tim Wildmon was more honest about the religious right \u2019 s intention of overturning Obergefell by using the same strategy they used to overturn Roe v. Wade\u200b\u2014something he told supporters would be harder to accomplish if the Respect for Marriage Act became law .\nHe urged activists to tell senators that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Other parts of the AFA action alert echoed the religious right \u2019 s hyperbolic claims : \u201c We Only Have 24 Hours Before Democrats Crush Religious Freedom , \u201d it warned .\nIt \u2019 s important to note that the religious right \u2019 s claims about the Respect for Marriage Act are not only rejected by the Mormon Church .\nThe law is backed by 40 religious organizations that represent millions of

political allies .\nFor white nationalists , the lack of denunciation read as an endorsement .\nFar-right authoritarian Vincent James , the treasurer of Fuentes \u2019 s America First organization , exulted this week that Trump \u2019 s refusal to disavow Fuentes was evidence that the group has successfully \u201c infiltrated the mainstream flank of the GOP , \u201d predicting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House , Fuentes could be \u201c the new Stephen Miller.\n\u201d Other Republican leaders have not covered themselves in glory , either , with many refusing to criticize Trump for the meeting , and others doing so only after days of pained silence .\nYe \u2019 s decision to use his time and cultural reach to spread extreme antisemitism comes during a time of rising violence and harassment against Jews in the U.S .\nHe is promoting an extreme version of an already aggressive , exclusionary , and authoritarian Christian nationalism that undermines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty , and church-state separation .\nHis trajectory , and the platform he is offering to Fuentes and a growing group of far-right figures grabbing onto his media coattails , threatens to further normalize bigotry and undermine democracy .\nBackground : Where Did Nick Fuentes Come From ?\nFuentes began building an online audience as an alt-right YouTuber while he was a teenager and college student .\nRight Wing Watch has covered him since 2017 , the year in which he traveled to Charlottesville , Virginia , for the notorious white supremacist \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a counterprotester was murdered .\nTrump \u2019 s election energized white nationalists like Fuentes , and when Trump was defeated by Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election , Fuentes was among the first to join Ali Alexander \u2019 s so-called \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d campaign to overturn the election .\nAmerica First flags flew on the grounds of the Capitol during the Jan. 6 insurrection , and members of the movement have been charged and convicted with breaching the Capitol .\nFuentes himself had VIP seating at Trump \u2019 s rally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marched on the Capitol .\nFuentes \u2019 enthusiastic participation in Stop the Steal helped him build connections within the MAGA movement , which he has used in an effort to spread and normalize his white nationalist and Christian nationalist beliefs .\nDuring a livestream show in which Fuentes referred to Jan. 6 as \u201c U.S .\nPatriot Day , \u201d Fuentes put it this way : receiving a subpoena from the House committee investigating the attack on the Capitol provides him credibility , he said , and will help him get out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reportedly came to Ye \u2019 s attention via Yiannopoulos , who is working on Ye \u2019 s campaign .\nA former Breitbart editor and gay right-wing cultural provocateur , Yiannopoulos now describes himself as an ex-gay and has become a militantly hard-right Catholic activist .\nYiannopoulos , who interned with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene \u2019 s congressional office this year , was also credited with getting Greene to speak at Fuentes \u2019 s AFPAC conference .\nYiannopoulos recently shared on his Telegram account a post in which Torba slammed Trump for \u201c continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers that be who hate Jesus Christ , hate our country , and see us all as disposable cattle according to their \u2018 holy \u2019 book.\n\u201d As Torba exulted after the appearance of Ye and Fuentes on InfoWars , the elevation of Fuentes has the effect of normalizing his extremism and expanding his reach .\nHaving been kicked off major social media platforms , Fuentes now operates his own streaming platform , Cozy.tv , which he uses to promote bigotry and espouse an extreme Christian nationalism , saying that Jews \u201c hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding office , and in fact should \u201c get the fuck out \u201d of this country .\nHe has also invited other far-right extremists to use the Cozy.tv platform .\nFuentes also gleefully promotes anti-Black stereotypes and racism .\nDuring his livestream he has used the N-word and defended his use of it\u200b .\n\u200bHe has declared , \u201c Generation Z has got to recover the wisdom of our racist grandparents.\n\u201d Fuentes often adopts a joking tone , making use of an alt-right strategy and Trumpian tactic of using humor and irony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denial\u2014to court young white men to his ideology .\nFuentes has enmeshed his message with the rhetoric of the MAGA movement by adopting the \u201c America First \u201d rhetoric of the Trump campaign , a political slogan deployed by nativist , antisemitic , and fascist activists during the first part of the 20th century .\nLike former Trump aide Steve Bannon , Fuentes positions himself as being at war with establishment Republicans not sufficiently committed to an \u201c America First \u201d agenda .\nIn December 2020 , Fuentes warned that if the GOP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump in power , \u201c We are going to destroy the GOP\u200b.\u200b \u201d In December 2021 , Elijah Schaffer , a former podcaster and host on Glenn Beck \u2019 s The Blaze , gave Fuentes hours of time to spread his ideology via Schaffer \u2019 s \u201d Slightly Offensive \u201d podcast and the \u201c You Are Here \u201d show , sympathetically characterizing Fuentes as having been mistreated and misrepresented by mainstream media .\nIn his conversations with Schaffer , Fuentes took credit for pushing Turning Point USA \u2019 s Charlie Kirk , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feuded , further to the right on immigration issues , and he celebrated Fox News powerhouse Tucker Carlson \u2019 s increasingly unabashed embrace of white nationalist rhetoric like the racist \u201c great replacement \u201d theory .\nIn those interviews and his own livestreamed musings , Fuentes has highlighted his cozy relationships with far-right politicians , his role in the so-called \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d campaign , his white nationalism and Christian nationalism , his authoritarian views , his misogyny , and his efforts to bring the GOP further to the right .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathetically characterizing Fuentes as having been mistreated and misrepresented by mainstream media .\nIn his conversations with Schaffer , Fuentes took credit for pushing Turning Point USA \u2019 s Charlie Kirk , another right-wing youth organizer with whom Fuentes has feuded , further to the right on immigration issues , and he celebrated Fox News powerhouse Tucker Carlson \u2019 s increasingly unabashed embrace of white nationalist rhetoric like the racist \u201c great replacement \u201d theory .\nIn those interviews and his own livestreamed musings , Fuentes has highlighted his cozy relationships with far-right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d campaign , his white nationalism and Christian nationalism , his authoritarian views , his misogyny , and his efforts to bring the GOP further to the right .\nWhile Fuentes \u2019 extremism and overt white nationalism have gotten him kicked off social media platforms , including the GETTR site run by former Trump aide Jason Miller , he has developed relationships close to some prominent right-wing Republicans , including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia , Rep. Paul Gosar \u200bof Arizona , and Trump-endorsed Arizona state Sen. Wendy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AFPAC conference , Greene was the honored guest , while Gosar , Rogers , and Idaho Lt. Gov .\nJanice McGeachin sent video greetings .\nGosar attended previous AFPAC gatherings in person .\nGreene has vigorously defended her decision to address the gathering , but recently , after days of critical media coverage of the recent Mar-a-Lago dinner , Greene declared that \u201c of course \u201d she denounced Fuentes and \u201c his racists and antisemitic ideology.\n\u201d Fuentes is also adored by Rogers , the far-right Arizona state senator .\nIn her video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she told the groypers , \u201c You and your fellow patriots are the future.\n\u201d Just two months earlier , Fuentes had praised Rogers as \u201c so freaking BASED , \u201d and she responded by thanking him and declaring , \u201c We love you.\n\u201d Gosar cheered them on , an example of what Political Research Associates \u2019 Ben Lorber calls a \u201c call-and-response \u201d relationship between Fuentes and his groypers and the rest of the MAGA right .\nFuentes \u2019 relationship with MAGA stars like Gosar and Rogers has opened up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At \u200ba satellite event\u200b organized by far-right groups during \u200bTurning Point USA \u2019 s gathering in Phoenix , Arizona , in December 2021 , GOP figures mingled with an array of extremists\u200b , \u200bincluding \u201c groypers \u201d ideologically aligned with Fuentes .\nWhen it became clear that Trump would not accept his defeat in the presidential election , Fuentes was quick to respond to far-right activist Ali Alexander \u2019 s call to \u201c stop the steal , \u201d which gave Fuentes an opportunity to rub shoulders and share speaking platforms with other MAGA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke at a \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d rally at the Arizona state capitol flanked by a U.S. flag emblazoned with his America First group \u2019 s logo .\nIn a video posted by a local branch of the Arizona GOP , he claimed that \u201c the Democrats hate us \u201d and denounced the \u201c globalist establishment that runs this country.\n\u201d The following month , he organized a rally at the Pennsylvania state capitol\u200b , as he explained in a tweet , \u201c to DEMAND that the State Legislature send their electors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jan. 6 , 2021 , Fuentes was seated in the VIP section at Trump \u2019 s pre-insurrection rally and attended the protest outside the U.S. Capitol .\nThe next month , he described the event in his keynote address at the America First Political Action Conference .\nHe told the gathered groypers that when he saw patriots surrounding the building and police retreating , and heard that politicians were \u200b \u201d scurrying \u201d to safety , \u201c I said to myself , \u2018 This is awesome !\n\u2019 \u201d Fuentes added , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spit on , stepped on , for decades , and to see the tables turned for once was a little bit refreshing actually.\n\u201d On the one-year anniversary of the insurrection , he celebrated it as \u201c part of our new heritage.\n\u201d After the House committee investigating the \u200bJan .\n6 attack subpoenaed Fuentes , he declared , \u201c I \u2019 m trying to get out a very important message about white genocide and the destruction of our people.\n\u201d \u200bGosar posted in defense of \u201c young conservative Christians like Nick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure political persecution.\n\u201d While Fuentes is most frequently described as a white nationalist , he is also an ardent Christian nationalist , a trait he shares with many religious-right leaders and influential Republican political operatives .\nFuentes \u2019 belief that Christianity , like whiteness , is essential to American culture and identity was on display at the 2021 America First Political Action Conference .\nIf America loses its \u201c white demographic core , \u201d he warned the audience , \u201c and if it loses its faith in Jesus Christ , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christian nation , \u201d Fuentes said .\n\u201c And that \u2019 s not just a slogan .\nWhen I say that America is a Christian nation , I \u2019 m saying that Jesus Christ is the son of God , and this is one nation under that God.\n\u201d The crowd erupted more than once in chants of \u201c Christ is King !\n\u201d a battle cry also heard at Stop the Steal rallies , and a phrase Ali Alexander included in his Dec. 1 tweet from Ye \u2019 s phone .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ not try to make his Christian nationalism more politically palatable by using the label \u201c Judeo-Christian \u201d to describe the U.S. Far from it .\nOn his Jan. 7 show , he said \u201c We need people who are true believers , true lovers of God and of Jesus Christ\u2014that is who we need leading the country.\n\u201d He added that the country needs more people who will stand up and say , \u201c I will never betray my country .\nI will never betray my people .\nI will never betray my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betray my Lord and my savior and his name , his sacred name , Jesus Christ.\n\u2019 And we \u2019 re going to say \u2018 Jesus Christ , \u2019 not this , you know , \u2018 Judeo-Christian \u2019 stuff .\nI spit , I spit on that.\n\u201d Fuentes vehemently denounces what he sees as the excessive influence of Zionism in the conservative movement and has a habit of pointing out media and conservative figures who are Jewish .\nHe once railed against right-wing activist and Daily Wire columnist Matt Walsh as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding , \u201c you work for Jews , you know.\n\u201d Fuentes shares with other Christian nationalists a penchant for describing current political struggles as a war between good and evil .\n\u201c Never forget the people that are in charge , what they \u2019 re doing is wrong , we \u2019 re on the right side of history , \u201d he told Schaffer\u200b in that Dec. 3 podcast interview\u200b .\n\u201c This is not ambiguous .\nIt is black and white .\nThey are evil .\nAnd we , though imperfect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in Jesus Christ .\nWe are the side that loves our country .\nWe are the side that supports perennial traditional values.\n\u201d Fuentes \u2019 s Christian nationalism is intertwined with his expressed preference for Christian authoritarianism .\nOne of the troubling findings from recent social science research on Christian nationalism is evidence that holding strong Christian nationalist views is strongly correlated not only with support for Trump and belief in the Big Lie , but \u200balso with the idea that authoritarian rule may be preferable to democratic rule\u200b and that violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by right-wing leaders .\n\u200b \u200b Fuentes told Schaffer and his Blaze co-hosts last year that if Donald Trump had become a \u201c tyrant , \u201d refusing to step down , ignoring what Congress or the courts said , and declaring that he was going to stay in office for three terms , Fuentes would \u201c be in favor of that 100 percent.\n\u201d He said he fundamentally disagrees with conservatives who might be unhappy with the outcome of the election but supported the transition of power .\nSuch people , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to \u201c this so-called democracy and equality \u201d rather than \u201c have order , than have prosperity , than have excellence , than live in a great country.\n\u201d During the same show , he mused on\u200b Christian authoritarianism : \u200b Specifically , when we think about what kind of government is best , or what we should have , you know , I look at , like , Christianity , I look at the Bible .\nIn Heaven , it \u2019 s ordered as a kingdom , you know , it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s not the republic of Heaven .\nIt \u2019 s not the state of Heaven .\nIt \u2019 s a kingdom , there \u2019 s a king , and the authority and the unity of that authority proceeds from one rule .\nAnd the church , the Catholic Church is structured this way , you know , the papacy , you \u2019 ve got one Pope at the top , and the unity of the dogma proceeds from him .\nAnd I think that similarly , a nation has to be structured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hierarchical , and people have to be ruled .\nAnd I believe that ultimately , there has to be authority for there to be law , for there to be order , for there to be any kind of semblance of coherence in a nation .\n[ T ] he problem is not that there is power , that there is authority .\nThere will always be authority .\nThere has to be authority .\nThe question is , who is going to wield it ?\nAnd , you know , right-wing people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I said earlier if Trump became like , you know , the Caesar of America , hypothetically , if he had got in in \u2019 16 and said , \u2018 You know what , I \u2019 m not leaving .\nAnd the courts tell me that I have to leave , well , I \u2019 ll disobey them , \u2019 and he went full , you know , Andrew Jackson , I would support it .\nI wouldn \u2019 t say , \u2018 This is authoritarianism .\nThis is in principle wrong.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the right man for the job .\nThis is a rightful ruler of America.\n\u2019 And , you know , and I would be OK with that .\n\u200bThe support for authoritarianism isn \u2019 t just theoretical either .\nFuentes joins many U.S. religious-right leaders in admiring Russian leader Vladimir Putin as well as Hungary \u2019 s strongman Prime \u200bMinister Viktor Orban , who has squelched dissent , eliminated checks and balances , and consolidated power in pursuit of his Christian nationalist vision .\nFuentes finds \u201c Christian autocratic rule \u201d an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schaffer , \u201c This experiment of overthrowing the kings and overthrowing the gods\u2014it \u2019 s been a complete disaster.\n\u201d Fuentes , who frequently expresses his contempt for women and has repeatedly described himself as an incel , focuses on \u201c red-pilling \u201d young men , who he says are his target audience .\nIncel culture , which fosters misogyny among young men online , has been linked to multiple acts of violence against women .\nFuentes has joked about and cheered on domestic violence .\nDuring a Feb. 9 livestream , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d when former NFL player Ray Rice beat up his fianc\u00e9 , even as he called it \u201c over the line.\n\u201d He added that he supported musician Chris Brown when he assaulted Rihanna .\nMoments later , he said he is \u201c against hitting women \u201d just as he opposes war and other things that are \u201c sometimes necessary.\n\u201d During his interview with Schaffer last December , Fuentes declared that he is \u201c not a fan \u201d of women , whom he considers \u201c not fully rational.\n\u201d He said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce a male heir to carry on his legacy .\nBut he didn \u2019 t like the idea of living with a \u201c nagging \u201d woman for the rest of his life , adding that the idea was \u201c a little nightmarish to me.\n\u201d Fuentes suggested that his preference would be to have women in the U.S. treated as they are in Saudi Arabia or in Afghanistan under the Taliban .\nAsked how gay people would be treated in an America run according to his wishes , he suggested it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been warmly praised by American religious-right leaders .\nShifting the Right to the Right Fuentes has explicitly stated that his strategy is to shift the \u200bentire right\u200b-wing movement further to the right , dragging the center and left in that direction as well .\nHe and other extremists are working to make that happen by insinuating themselves into battles being waged by other camps of right-wing activists , including opposition to vaccine requirements , masks in schools , \u201c critical race theory , \u201d and LGBTQ-affirming policies .\nFuentes gloated to Schaffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strident anti-immigrant positions since groypers publicly criticized Kirk on the issue , while acknowledging that Kirk may also have been following the lead of Fox News \u2019 s Tucker Carlson .\nIn a profile of Fuentes earlier this year , Political Research Associates \u2019 Ben Lorber noted that Fuentes \u2019 groypers \u201c have become a countercultural presence , especially on the nationalist flank of the broader Gen Z Right , leaving their imprint on the culture\u2014and with it , the politics\u2014of a rising generation of conservative leaders.\n\u201d While Fuentes is persona non @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attending the Conservative Political Action Conference and Turning Point USA events\u2014the influence \u200bof white nationalism can be seen everywhere from Fox News to the floor of Congress .\nAnd that was before Fuentes began reaping massive publicity from associating himself with Ye .\nLess than two years after Rep. Steve King was stripped of his committee assignments for comments defending white nationalism , Rep. Gosar has received little pushback and no punishment from his colleagues for publicly embracing Fuentes and speaking at his conference .\n( When Gosar was stripped of his committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sharing an animated video portraying himself killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez . )\nIncoming Republican House leader Kevin McCarthy has pledged to fully embrace Greene .\nA week after Trump \u2019 s dinner with Fuentes , PBS NewsHour asked 57 Republican lawmakers if they would condemn the dinner , noting that GOP leaders had been \u201c overwhelmingly \u201d silent on the topic over the Thanksgiving weekend .\nMost did not respond , and among those who did , many made general condemnations of antisemitism without criticism Trump directly .\nAt the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streaming show that he had raised an \u201c insane \u201d amount of money for his Feb. 25 America First Political Action Conference , adding that people who fund the conference are also contributing to his America First Foundation \u2019 s plant to build a new \u201c facility \u201d with a studio .\nFuentes said then that America First would be doing \u201c a lot of campaigning \u201d in the 2022 midterm elections , adding that he had already spoken with \u201c three or four major congressional candidates that we are going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PACs , the works.\n\u201d A week later , he claimed , \u201c America First has allies in Congress , will be hosting a 1,000-person conference this February , has built its own censorship-proof streaming platform , controls conservative chapters on over 20 campuses and will be deploying hundreds of volunteers to five states this year for the midterms .\n2022 is our year .\nWe run this.\n\u201d It \u2019 s not clear how much of this was just bluster .\nFuentes did speak with Joe Kent , the Trump-endorsed candidate who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year \u2019 s GOP primary .\nWhen Fuentes began bragging about their conversation , Kent publicly distanced himself , but his association with Fuentes remained an issue in his campaign .\nKent was defeated in the general election .\nIn October , when Fuentes was buoyed by visions of a \u201c red wave \u201d that would sweep Republicans into power and set the stage for Trump \u2019 s return to the White House after the 2024 elections , Fuentes pledged to spend the next two years raising an \u201c army \u201d of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch staff in preparation to take over the government from within .\nAn unknown number of groypers may also be following Fuentes \u2019 s encouragement to do the same with the Republican Party by running for positions in local party structures\u2014a tactic also promoted by other far-right figures like Steve Bannon .\nDuring Fuentes \u2019 s Nov. 4 livestream , follower Alex Roncelli sent Fuentes a superchat message so he could brag about being elected as a GOP county chairman in Michigan .\nAfter the far-right \u2019 s mostly dismal showing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were evidence of the need for a right-wing dictatorship to replace democracy .\nSince being drawn into Ye \u2019 s orbit and all-but-declared presidential campaign , Fuentes has stepped away from his daily livestream to make the most of the opportunity to use Ye \u2019 s cultural reach to spread his bigotry and extremism .\nHe and Ye have big plans in the works ; during the Dec. 1 InfoWars program , Ye told Jones that he and Fuentes are working on a new Constitution for the U.S .\nThe unwillingness of Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disavow Fuentes even after his extremism was brought to light by national media are evidence that Fuentes and the \u201c groypers \u201d in his America First movement have indeed had success in insinuating themselves and their ideology into the Republican Party and broader right-wing movement .\nAnd with that newfound influence , they \u2019 re eager to bring the U.S. closer to their vision of a hard-right authoritarian government that imposes its vision on Americans and dominates its opponents \u201c without mercy

\u2014the rhetoric at the heart of recent political attacks on LGBTQ people\u2014the Proud Boys held signs with messages like , \u201c Groomers make Santa sad \u201d and \u201c Groomers go home.\n\u201d Another read \u201c Proud Boys Story Hour Today \u2019 s Book Death of the West Chapter 9 , \u201d in an apparent reference to a book authored by far-right activist Pat Buchanan , who fearmongers about immigrants replacing \u201c America \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boys members dancing to the \u201c YMCA , \u201d the unofficial LGBTQ anthem , and a police officer acknowledging that he high-fived a Proud Boy because he had complimented his mustache .\nOn Dec. 3 , the day of planned event , Cheryl Ryan , the school \u2019 s manager announced its cancellation .\nTaking the church \u2019 s stage decorated by kids who had planned on listening to stories that afternoon , she said the school had canceled the event after an internal debate over \u201c how this community could be best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbus Police and was initially told they could hire a special duty officer \u201c who may or may not show up because they \u2019 re understaffed , \u201d while a \u201c community defense team \u201d they hired felt uncomfortable with a police presence .\nUltimately , the event was canceled when the performers said they were uncomfortable performing without a police presence .\n\u201c The world is getting more and more unsafe for the LGBTQ community ; the attacks are constant and getting worse , \u201d Ryan said .\n\u201c The fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple event shows the extent of the damage .\nWe have to do better.\n\u201d \u201c I implore this community \u2019 s leaders to consider how this could \u2019 ve gone differently , \u201d she said at another point in her

disputed the school \u2019 s account that they were absent and said they tried to work with the school and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief issued a message to the community after an officer was seen high-fiving a Proud Boys member , claiming that the dialogue team member \u2019 s action \u201c was not done to show solidarity but to diffuse a tense situation.\n\u201d \u201c I along with the

just how far she has come .\nLast week , the once ostracized QAnon conspiracy theorist spoke at an event held at former President Donald Trump \u2019 s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and at which Trump himself appeared , and she is amazed at just how far she has come .\nCrokin was one of the earliest promoters of the QAnon conspiracy theory and has spent the last several years spreading increasingly wild conspiracy theories , primarily about \u201c Pizzagate , \u201d a convoluted conspiracy theory alleging that thousands of highly influential politicians , entertainers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global satanic pedophile ring .\nIn 2016 , one man radicalized by the \u201c Pizzagate \u201d conspiracy theory entered a pizzeria in Washington , D.C. , and fired his weapon , believing that children were held captive in the basement .\nThe QAnon conspiracy theory , which appeared on fringe message boards in 2017 , is seen as the successor to \u201c Pizzagate.\n\u201d Despite the fact that literally none of the predictions that Crokin made over the years ever came true , she never followed through on her threat to \u201c bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she didn \u2019 t see mass arrests of leaders of the supposed global satanic pedophile ring by the end of 2019 .\nInstead , Crokin has doggedly continued to spread the conspiracy theory , at one point even expressing her gratitude \u201c for everything that Q has done for humanity.\n\u201d While QAnon was once a fringe far-right conspiracy theory , it was systematically mainstreamed by Trump and those in his orbit , so much so that now someone like Crokin can be invited to speak at Mar-a-Lago .\nLast Tuesday , Crokin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America \u2019 s Future , an organization affiliated with former national security adviser and QAnon conspiracy theorist Michael Flynn .\nAt the event , it was announced that America \u2019 s Future was launching a program called \u201c Project Defend & Protect Our Children \u201d that will be overseen by a board featuring Crokin , discredited journalist Lara Logan , and others .\nTo Crokin \u2019 s delight , Trump made a surprise appearance at the event later that evening .\nThe day after the event at Mar-a-Lago , Crokin appeared on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she marveled at how she has gone from \u201c ostracized \u201d for spreading \u201c Pizzagate \u201d conspiracy theories to talking about it openly as a featured speaker at an event at which the former president appeared .\n\u201c We had this wonderful fundraiser to raise money for this cause at Mar-a-Lago last night , and I got the privilege and the honor to speak at Mar-a-Lago about \u2018 Pizzagate , ' \u201d Crokin boasted .\n\u201c Six years ago , I was a lone soldier fighting this ; no one wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the media had so successfully redefined what it is , and it was so taboo .\nI can \u2019 t even tell you how badly I was ostracized for talking about \u2018 Pizzagate , \u2019 exposing \u2018 Pizzagate , \u2019 and how many friends I lost and what a lonely journey it was .\nSo , to go from that to being at Mar-a-Lago and being able to freely talk about \u2018 Pizzagate \u2019 there and say

Marjorie Taylor Greene ; when she announced that \u201c of course \u201d she denounced Fuentes and his bigotry , Right Wing Watch reminded the world that she had enthusiastically spoken at Fuentes \u2019 s white nationalist America First Political Action conference earlier this year and had been unapologetic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episode demonstrated the ways that Right Wing Watch \u2019 s ongoing research , documentation and analysis of far-right figures and organizations helps journalists , scholars , anti-extremism researchers , and our own readers understand and disrupt far-right ideologies and power-building strategies .\nThe House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol performed an essential truth-telling service this year by documenting the breadth and depth of the attempts to overturn the election .\nThose efforts culminated in a failed attempt to prevent congressional affirmation of Joe Biden \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Capitol on Jan. 6 , 2021 , and the failed attempt by some Republican lawmakers to reject the Electoral College votes of battleground states that Trump falsely claimed to have won .\nRight Wing Watch research and reporting on these same efforts\u2014including threats of bloody civil war from Oath Keepers \u2019 founder Stewart Rhodes\u2014provided the committee with valuable primary source material that was cited in at least one committee subpoena and shown during the committee \u2019 s public hearings .\nEven before the 2020 presidential election , Right Wing Watch had warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s political supporters .\nWhen Trump and his allies responded to his defeat by launching an all-out effort to overturn the election , Right Wing Watch extensively covered so-called \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d rallies and the Trump team \u2019 s legal and political efforts to defy the Constitution , overturn the results , and keep Trump in power .\nRight Wing Watch documented calls for violence at a Washington , D.C. , rally the day before the insurrection .\nRight Wing Watch researchers also documented the extent to which Trump \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lies about the election and promoted his efforts to hold onto power unconstitutionally .\nOur work was cited a dozen times in \u201c Christian Nationalism and the January 6 , 2021 Insurrection , \u201d a major report released earlier this year by Christians Against Christian Nationalism and allied groups .\nAs the Jan. 6 committee \u2019 s public hearings focused attention on the criminal conspiracy theory to overturn the election , Right Wing Watch released video explainers about some key players like the Oath Keepers\u2014whose leader Stewart Rhodes has been convicted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role played by Christian nationalist ideology in fomenting the insurrection .\nRight Wing Watch also followed up many of the public hearings by publishing analyses of the day \u2019 s revelations .\nRight Wing Watch also added to the committee \u2019 s work by providing additional context and analysis .\nFor example , committee Vice Chair Rep. Liz Cheney cited an email sent by a Republican lawyer to document the extent of the campaign to pressure Vice President Mike Pence to abandon his constitutional duty to oversee a smooth transfer of power during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nRight Wing Watch recognized the author of the email and explained that the email was further evidence of the extent to which officials associated with the religious-right Family Research Council were involved in the plot to keep Trump in power .\nIn addition , Right Wing Watch researchers briefed progressive activists in a series of online sessions hosted by coalition organizations to promote grassroots activism designed to urge local public officials to demand accountability for those responsible for attacks on American democracy .\nRight Wing Watch provided an early warning system on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for state and national office this year , educating journalists and ensuring that campaign coverage helped voters understand that dangerous extremism was on the ballot .\nRight Wing Watch began covering Christian nationalist Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano well before he became the Republican nominee for governor\u2014even before he entered the race .\nMastriano was a major promoter of Trump \u2019 s false stolen-election claims in Pennsylvania and used campaign funds to bus supporters to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 , 2021 .\nThis April , Right Wing Watch broke the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Patriots Arise \u201d conference organized by QAnon conspiracy theorists Alan and Francine Fosdick , who awarded Mastriano a \u201c sword of David.\n\u201d Mastriano told the crowd that he would be elected governor because \u201c my God will make it so.\n\u201d Right Wing Watch also documented Mastriano \u2019 s ties to antisemitism promoter Andrew Torba of Gab , dominionist Lance Wallnau , and a conspiracy-promoting road show led by businessman Clay Clark and former Trump adviser Michael Flynn .\nRight Wing Watch \u2019 s reporting on Mastriano was cited or used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including those in national outlets like the New York Times and major Pennsylvania outlets like the Philadelphia Inquirer .\nAnother candidate whose extremism had long been documented by Right Wing Watch was Michael Peroutka , a neo-Confederate and Christian nationalist with far-right views about the U.S. Constitution , who was chosen by Maryland Republicans as their candidate for state attorney general .\nAs Right Wing Watch noted at the time , it was outrageous to imagine Peroutka as the state \u2019 s chief law enforcement officer given that \u201c Peroutka declared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer a legitimate governing body because its support for marriage equality violated God \u2019 s law , and that therefore none of the laws it passed were \u2018 legally valid and legally enforceable.\n\u2019 \u201d When Peroutka won the GOP nomination , news outlets from Vice to the Washington Post turned to Right Wing Watch and its years of covering Peroutka \u2019 s extremism .\nThe Washington Post linked to our coverage of Peroutka leading the crowd in Dixie .\nRight Wing Watch is an essential and trusted source for national media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Trumpism , Christian nationalism , white nationalism , antisemitism , anti-LGBTQ bigotry , election denialism , QAnon , and other conspiracy theories .\nIn addition , Right Wing Watch is frequently cited by other right-wing researchers and scholars whose work focuses on far-right extremism , Christian nationalism , and more .\nOur work reaches reporters , progressive activists , and the general public through media coverage , interview with print and broadcast journalists , and through our social media channels .\nRight Wing Watch videos logged more than 1.1 million views on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million impressions on Twitter , where Right Wing Watch has more than 362,000 followers .\nIn previous years , Right Wing Watch coverage has resulted in extremists like Alex Jones being exposed and deplatformed .\nDuring the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic , Right Wing Watch coverage of evangelist Jim Bakker selling snake oil resulted in several state attorneys general taking legal action against him .\nWe need your help .\nEvery day , Right Wing Watch exposes extremism to help the public , activists , and journalists understand the strategies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly aggressive and authoritarian far-right movement .\nThe threat is growing , but our
