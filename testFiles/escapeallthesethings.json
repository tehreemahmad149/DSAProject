have wondered if Tim was or is The Elijah to come .\nThey were counting on him to tell them when to follow the protocols to be accomplished in the End Times .\nPersonally , I don \u2019 t know if Tim was/is The Elijah , and it was never a huge question for me to fully know , because I was conceived in a church that strongly taught Bible prophecy and prophecy has been a part of my whole entire life up to this day .\nThe conclusion I found of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAME conclusion Tim came to : To prepare to \u2018 escape all these things \u2019 , or be ready for God \u2019 s Kingdom on Earth , is the SAME preparation .\nThis same preparation means facing where one does not really think or feel God/Yehovah is one hundred percent good and work on it .\nAnd THEN in everyday life , one must work on loving God with everything you have and loving your neighbor as yourself .\nBesides , this message is also what John The Baptist taught to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Messiah ( Luke 3 especially verses 10 through 14 ) Any Elijah telling me to go somewhere won \u2019 t do any good if I am not doing that daily work .\nPlus , although Tim \u2019 s understanding of Bible prophecy was not perfect -as he admitted many times- there was enough understood to know what to look for next to happen in prophecy , and what to do when it happens .\nWhat is going to happen to the Escape All These Things website and Know The Future book ?\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me to lead and support the ministry , keeping all the free articles and his book maintained on the website for you to learn where to go if the End Times prophecies start unfolding faster .\nEverything on the website will continue to stay functional for your use .\nTim spent decades researching and making content on Bible Prophecy .\nHe shared while he was ill that he felt the work was quite complete on the website in terms of Bible Prophecy .\nBut there was one project that he started with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not find the strength to make happen which very much complimented the material on his website .\nWe were to write a book together on how to work on life \u2019 s daily struggles in a relationship with God and loving your neighbor as yourself .\nTim realized from the tens of thousands of emails he received over the years that people struggled with everyday living issues .\nThese issues are actually what God calls us to focus on and face to grow spiritually and be prepared for The Messiah \u2019 s coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to make that book over these years , I instead started making videos and a website as diligently as I could this last year to share what I felt led to share in that book not written .\nI have just been so blessed by God because He showed me so many things in my life to see Him more and more as purely good .\nTo know how to grow in loving Him and loving my neighbor as myself is something I can not keep to myself !\nI feel it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel that freedom !\nGod \u2019 s love through what He showed through what The Messenger , The Messiah , said and did , and lived and died through , does set people free and give them peace .\nMy own testimony says it is true .\nI just have to share it !\nThe website and YouTube channel are up and running and I am working on more content as I can .\nNow that I get to take care of Escape All These Things , the Owned By Love ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and holding down a job , it will not be easy .\nI am NOT worried !\nIt \u2019 s all God \u2019 s anyway , including my son .\nMy loved fellow humans , we will be with Tim in Eternity praising our God together forever and ever .\nHere is a small excerpt spoken at Tim \u2019 s online memorial : \u201c There was no contradiction for Tim with the belief that end times are near .\nHe was the first to preach to be ready for end times and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live a long life until your natural death .\nHis healthy skepticism , even to his own findings and interpretations of the Bible , was the healthy foundation of the ministry .\nAs he said himself several weeks before his passing , his teaching of love for God and for others were the conclusion of his end-time prophecies.\n\u201d In Tim \u2019 s last months , he doubled down on focusing on his relationship with Yehovah .\nMay this encourage you to be excited to prepare as a bride prepares for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief in each of you , note that I will write you again with another newsletter .\nP.S .\nPlease accept that I have soooo many tasks in front of me related to Tim \u2019 s passing and organizing for the future of my special needs son ( + holding down a job ) , that you will probably not hear back from me for quite a while when you write me a private message .\nI accept all of your prayers and support .", "author": "Tim

"content": "Many people did not expect to see the day that Prince Charles would be made king .\nDoes this new event fulfill Bible Prophecy ?\n... What Would Tim Think Of This Global Event ?\nMany hungry Bible Prophecy readers have reached out to me wondering what Tim or I might think about Prince Charles becoming a king .\nFor Tim McHyde , this subject was an intriguing and fun topic to consider in the Bible Prophecy arena .\nIn Tim 's second edition of his book , Know The Future , he actually had a write-up on the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that write-up out and instead transferred it into a free article on the website which I believe is this link .\nWhy ?\nHe realized it was a side topic and not really a main , important ingredient to End Time events unfolding .\nThis topic did not make the cut to be included in his End Time Prophecy Timeline in his book either .\nDo n't get me wrong , the topic of the Antichrist was very important to Tim , but not so much WHO that person might be .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove or disprove where we were in End Time events .\nThis is a direct quote of what Tim did focus on instead : `` Honestly , I expected to simply wake up one morning with the news that Damascus was destroyed . ''\nTim is referring to Isaiah 17:1 .\nBut , Tim did think the possible 'proofs ' of Prince Charles being a fit for the Antichrist were very , very compelling and wrote a few free articles on the subject here on this website .\nOne particular post of Tim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was actually something Monte Judah wrote and gave Tim permission to use .\nTim really loved that article and its photo .\nI wish to share a little side note about Tim and me meeting Monte Judah for those who miss Tim and like little snippets of some of his life experiences .\nWe met Monte Judah at a Bible Prophecy Conference in 2009 where Tim was the keynote speaker .\nOur impression of him then was that he is a kind , giving , and very driven man to find truth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can .\nHe is intelligent and definitely could overpower with the knowledge he has any day .\nBut he was kind during our interactions and not argumentative .\nHe definitely shared his beliefs clearly and lovingly and gave the room that possibly you would not agree with him .\nI have not had the honor of meeting him since , but I am glad I got to do it at least once in this lifetime .\nI think if Tim were with us today and had witnessed Queen Elizabeth passing and Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his interest to go and search for more information on if 'King ' Charles would still fit as the Antichrist , but it would be a short search and not fluster him in the least .\nMy guess is that he would probably still hold on to 'King ' Charles being the strongest candidate for Antichrist .\nSome Will Be Compelled To Make King Charles -Not Prince Charles- Still Fit As has been the case for thousands of years , people continue to strive to unravel the mysteries of prophecy .\nOne thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that events like this do not slow a Bible Prophecy Enthusiast down a bit .\nIt actually makes them even more excited to figure things out .\nFor instance , if one goes into research mode , one would possibly find a tiny debate on if the true number of Beast is 666 or 616 as found in one of Tim 's articles .\nOr another popular idea that even Tim would possibly focus on is that usually , a person does not lose titles when it comes to rulers in kingdoms .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he keeps the title of prince and picks up also the title of king .\nActually , King Charles has many other titles already as well .\nSo maybe this interesting factoid just makes some Bible Prophecy researchers stay on track with their belief that he is still the best candidate we have seen yet .\nWhat might Tim think now that Charles is King Charles III and April 2022 has passed ?\nBoy , would n't we all like to know that for sure by him being here and telling us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades I can partly speculate and extrapolate from what he has left us , and from what I knew of him .\nHe would have recognized he got some things wrong concerning Bible Prophecy .\nHe would pick himself back up and go forward because prophecy was his passion since he was ten years old .\nI think this section of one of his later articles probably gives us the best clues we can get of what Tim would think today : A few years ago , I shared publicly my conviction on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Isa 17 = Ps 83 ) : April 2022 .\nAs the time left for this deadline was whittled down to only a year or so , I felt some anxiety .\nWould I turn out to be wrong and branded a false prophet by those who glossed over the fact that I never said \u201c thus saith the Lord \u201d but was only sharing my conviction for their consideration to take to their prayer closet ?\nIt was a real possibility .\nAs Paul said that we \u201c see through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we hear from God ( 1Co 13:12 ) .\nWe may easily misunderstand , get it wrong , and have a humbling \u201c learning experience \u201d when we put ourselves out there regarding what we are convicted that God has shown us .\nAs is my custom with nearly everything , I immediately talked to God about it .\nI told him that if I misunderstood what he had shared with me then I will look like a fool , just another failed date-setter but that \u2019 s OK , I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prepared to look wrong or foolish some of the time , just like the Israelites did as God led them into a dead-end at the shore of the Red Sea with the Egyptian army bearing down on them .\nGod \u2019 s response to that thought floored me .\nA few days later when I was unable to sleep I opened up my Bible to continue reading through it in the hope of finding some comfort .\nI was in the psalms and happened to reach Psalm 83 , the prophetic psalm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends with the destruction of Damascus .\nI know it so well that I was tempted to skip it , not expecting to find any comfort for my suffering there .\nI reread it anyway , and , to my surprise , I saw something new and exciting I had completely missed until now\u2026 So how did I get myself in this position ?\nTo be sure , I never wanted to be a \u201c date-setter.\n\u201d Long-time readers will remember the many articles I have written to debunk popular prophecy theories attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shemitah , the Revelation 12 Woman ) .\nEven as early as after \u201c Y2K \u201d ( Jan 2000 ) , I could see how obvious it was that as soon as someone published a prophecy theory with a date attached to it the theory was destined to fail and be proven false every time .\nNo exceptions .\nTherefore to set a date of my own for a Bible prophecy was the last thing I wanted to do .\nThe End In 2026 ?\nIt 's Now Possible Since learning in 2001 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , I 've had to rule out three Sabbath year cycle windows for the final 7 years ( 2003-2009 , 2010-2016 , 2017-2023 ) .\nWith the next window ( 2024-2030 ) less than 7 years away , I 'm ready to share why I believe , based on the real end time sign of Mt 24:14 , that this can be the one .\nIf it is , the `` birth pains '' ( WW3 + Wormwood , Lk 21:10-11 ) would hit near its middle in 2026 with Yeshua returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed to convince me about 2026 and what you can do about it ...\nBut God got a hold of me and changed my thinking that it was foolish to ever set a date .\nI got there by an unexpected turn of events in my life .\nStarting in 2012 to my surprise God began to give me dreams about my and my family \u2019 s future and even the end times ( see my Support Team content to read them ) .\nThrough some reasonable deduction , a couple of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this very first event on my Revelation Roadmap end time timeline , the Mideast Nuclear war that leaves Damascus a ruinous heap ( Isaiah 17:1 ) .\nI doubted that this revelation on timing was some reward just for me .\nI felt I was to share it\u2014not with the world , mind you , as if to warn everyone like some kind of watchman which I am not .\nRather , only with those readers who valued my work enough to support it .\nThose were the ones who could possibly entertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date to plug into the timeline he had helped me put together .\nI already knew well the value of having a real approaching date attached to a prophecy to make people pay better attention to God \u2019 s word .\nWe \u2019 re all distracted by the cares of this world and could use a sense of urgency to convict us to prepare spiritually for the end .\nSharing my conviction on timing could provide a valuable benefit for readers , which is why I considered going against my better judgment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , only someone who is not familiar with the failed track record of Christian date-setting would put out dates of their own .\nI did not want to be a fool .\nDate Setting As A Red Flag Depends On Its Rationale My dreams got me to see something I was missing in my conclusion after decades of debunking prophecy dates theories .\nNamely that prophetic dates always fail and only fools set dates .\nThat was not accurate .\nI saw instead that the real problem was that all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debunk were conceived by taking Bible verses out of context and making humanistic reasoning on their meaning or timing based on some arbitrary calculation .\nThese always failed because the human mind does not see the future .\nThe prophets and saints in the Bible came up with dates differently .\nWhen giving timing for a prophecy , it always came by divine revelation from the only One who does see the future .\nFor example , Joseph \u2019 s prophecy of seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs you may recall , Pharaoh \u2019 s dream pictured seven healthy cows and seven healthy heads of grain along with seven thin , sickly cows and seven thin , scorched heads of grain .\nJoseph did not have to invent anything or read into the Word of God to make his date-based prediction about what was going to happen over the next 14 years in Egypt .\nIn other words , I was reminded from my own dreams that date-setting of itself was not wrong as I thought since the prophets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was date-setting based on humanistic reasoning apart from revelation from God .\nIronically , the only prophecy theories that spread widely were those with some persuasive argument for why they must happen at such and such a time .\nThis makes sense as you are not likely to put much stock in what a stranger on the Internet says God told them .\nYou can not verify that .\nYet if they pull verses out of context in the Bible and give you an intriguing explanation for why they are about some planetary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can follow their deductions and come to the same conclusion .\nAt least to the point that you are left afraid to just ignore their theory in case they are right .\nUncertain either way , you then forward it to your friends to ask their opinion ... who then do the same , making it go viral ... Later , the same article continues ... Once again , I [ Tim ] could very well be wrong as God has never spoken to me or given me a vision of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens in 2022 !\n\u201d .\nAll I know is that with this coming sabbath year cycle of 2024-2031 things continue to develop in the world ( 2 Tim 3 , COVID-19 ) and my own personal life ( hard testing , meeting prophets ) that never did in the lead up to any of the other cycles I was watching ( 2003-2010 ; 2010-2017 ; 2017-2024 ) .\nIt 's up to you to seek God yourself on this in light of what the Bible teaches on proving all things ( 1Th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared in the church body carefully ( 1Co 14:29 ) .\nIf you hear also that time is short , then I encourage you to use that as inspiration to seek God on what to do to prepare spiritually so that when you wake up that morning in 2022 with the confirmation in the news that the end really is nigh , you will at least know you are as ready as you could be .\nIf you want help , my support team articles have plenty of guidance on areas of repentance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like he gives me more and more regularly .\nThis was the end of the article I quoted here .\nThere are some gems of consideration in what he shares .\nEveryone who reads it will come up with different ideas of what those gems should be .\nBut prophecy for EVERYONE is this messy !\nLet me , Katrina , reassure you here- Even the Apostles got part of prophecy WRONG .\nThey literally thought our beloved Messiah was going to return in THEIR lifetime .\nAnd what some of those Apostles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand years later , that they were really inspired to write those things down for us even if they had the timing off .\nActually , each generation within these couple millennia has thought that the Messiah was going to return in their lifetime !\nWhy is this reassuring ?\nWell , we all have a ton of space to not know it all and Yehovah is still loving each one of us as He loves all His children that ever lived .\nHe is ok if we do n't get some things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all and have all answers .\nAs Tim quoted : You ask me , Katrina , what I think ?\nMy answer is- we each have just enough time if we continue , or start now to `` prepare spiritually [ so ] you will at least know you are as ready as you could be , '' as Tim said in the last paragraph up here .\nHe does have many support team articles that help as he mentioned .\nAnd I add more there as well .\nTim and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many years in a more precise way of what you need to focus on , and the tools to prepare spiritually for End Time events or for The Kingdom when you are raised from the dead , whichever came first in your life .\nAlthough we never wrote that book but only spoke about its contents over many years , I have started putting together tools and what to focus on at a new website BECAUSE so many of you over the years have reached out to us sharing your strong desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and especially yourselves , be prepared for End Time events ...\nBUT many of those you love are totally repelled by Bible Prophecy !\nIt just so happens that it does not matter if a person focuses a lot on Bible Prophecy to still start preparing for End Time events .\nNOW HOLD ON .\nHear me out .\nEveryone who is a Believer has to focus on doing what Yeshua said to do in one 's everyday life whether they are living in End Times OR not .\nYeshua gives us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be doing are .\nDid you know that doing those things is what helps your wedding garments to get totally white for your wedding day to Yeshua ?\nI do n't want anyone to hear , `` go away , I never knew you '' .\nMatthew 7:23 .\nI suggest reading the whole chapter could be of help to you .\nI think that whether you hold out to this year , 2022 being the beginning of the last seven-year cycle , or you give up on this being the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to really hunker down and focus on to be prepared .\nI think it is exciting to live life and see new developments that many times we do n't expect , like Charles becoming king , come to pass .\nAnd , I think we have , at minimum , one more seven-year cycle to go before the very last cycle .\nbut what I think I only humbly share as a total guess , just as everyone is guessing ( except maybe you or the one you are looking up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you still believe this cycle now is IT .\nYou definitely could be right .\nOne of them has to be the last .\n\ud83d\ude42", "author": "Katrina McHyde", "url": "https://escapeallthesethings.com/king-charles-in-bible-prophecy/", "published": "Tue, 13 Sep 2022 01:25:22

new year with a website post about why Christ can not come in the next year .\nHaving been with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many emails and predictions sent to Tim , especially at the beginning of the Gregorian calendar , namely January 1st of each year .\nHe spent many hours each day responding to a great number of those emails .\nI am sure many of you miss that amount of interaction with our deceased

clear template of Tim 's teachings and findings that actually are applicable each year , at least for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we still have just a little while left .\nAnd I definitely agree that we must focus on personal preparation of our hearts to be ready for Our Lord 's coming because just knowing Bible Prophecy in more detail will not save you .\nNotice that The Scribes and Pharisees , during Christ 's physical life , were blinded because they thought knowing The Scriptures in the most perfect detail they could AND feeling they were superior to others for their knowledge and their practices of perfection would save them and make God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Messiah , and the world 's Messiah , because of their improper focus on what God really wants .\nThankfully , Tim pointed people in his yearly article to the things each of us need to focus on in doing and thinking every day of our lives to be prepared for our Messiah 's second coming .\nI will add small comments throughout Tim 's article below within parentheses and in italic so you know what is Tim 's writing and what I add .\nI hope on some level the reposting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort as it is a strong piece of Tim that is still with us .\n`` What 's Prophesied For 2021 ?\n`` ( This applies for 2023 also ) It happens early every January : a spike in visitors to my website .\nAt the prospect of a new year , `` many go to and fro '' ( i.e.\n, searching `` to increase knowledge '' ) on the Internet ( Dan 12:4 ) looking for predictions .\nWith all the prophecies in the Bible , Christians wonder if some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The perennial favorites among them are the Second Coming of Christ and the Rapture .\nA large percentage of Christians continue to think every year that `` this could be the year that Christ returns ... '' or `` ... that the Rapture happens . ''\nThat 's not just my opinion as someone who has run a prophecy website since 1999 .\nAn Ipsos poll asking how likely certain events were to happen in the coming year confirmed this .\nAccording to the poll , here 's what percentage of different subgroups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` somewhat likely that Jesus Christ would return to earth in the next year . ''\nWhy the Poll Results Blindsided Me When I heard the results of that poll back in December 2006 , I was surprised .\nI had not been expecting so many Christians to think it was still possible for Jesus to come in the next twelve months .\nHere are two reasons why it blindsided me back then fourteen years ago : \u2022 Even before 2006 , there have been many years of failed expectations for Christ 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest one up till then ) .\nPretty much every year since Christ left , people have been hoping or predicting he would return with no show .\nWhy would anyone expect it imminently anymore after so many failed hopes ?\n\u2022 Back in 2006 , I assumed that more Christians were aware of some basics of prophecy as I had known since my teens .\nFor example , Paul wrote that Jesus can not return to gather us to him until the `` man of sin '' ( Antichrist ) takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nCertainly , I thought , most Christians know that this `` Great Tribulation '' of the Antichrist they heard of must arrive before the Second Coming ?\nNot so ...\nIn other words , I was a bit naive = ) .\nThe poll helped to fix that by learning how blessed I was to be exposed to the history of rapture predictions and key NT verses about Christ 's return .\nI had been in a bubble , in a way , as a person who has studied prophecy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the greater Christian audience who mostly never receive any teaching on prophecy .\nIn fact , I would say most Christians have never even read Revelation because it frightens them .\nFinally , while I hear about every popular prophecy prediction each year from readers who ask my opinion on them , most Christians hear nothing of them except when they go up on billboards across America as Harold Camping did in 2011 .\nMy Response to the Poll ?\nAfter better understanding this Christian blind spot on end-time prophecy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the first version of this article called `` Why Jesus Ca n't Come Back in 2007 . ''\nThe title was designed to get people to stop and pay attention .\nIn it , I explained why it was impossible for Jesus to come back in 2007 based on what Bible prophecy literally says .\nI covered the many missing prophetic events that have to come before not just the Second Coming , but also the Rapture ( see below for the list ) .\nMost readers thanked me for shedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but some were miffed .\nFor example : \u2022 `` Are n't you claiming to know the day or hour that Jesus said we ca n't ? ''\n\u2022 `` How dare you claim to know such a thing , as if you 're God ? ''\n\u2022 `` You 're a terrible person for saying this and dashing people 's hopes . ''\n( People hate buzzkills ! )\nI learned from all that , too , something that I notice most of my readers have not picked up on about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the truth .\nPaul explained this in his warning about why people get deceived by the Antichrist in the end time : In the past few years , I 've become convinced that `` those who are perishing '' refers to not just non-Christians but also Christians , `` few '' of whom are saved according to Jesus ' warning This happens because Satan deceives the whole world ( Rev 12:9 ) including Christians ( Mt 24:4-5 ) , most of whom want to be left in their comforting reassurance of salvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deception ( had they read it ) .\nIf you burst someone 's bubble , they may become very `` unchristian-like '' on you , just as Jesus warned about truth-telling ( Mt 7:6 ) .\nIf you have `` received a love for the truth '' that is above your desire for reassurance and acceptance ( which truth-loving and -seeking will cost you ) , then read on to learn what most Christians are misunderstanding about end-time prophecy ... My Track Record of Proclaiming `` The end is not yet '' ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind That Nothing prophetic happened in 2007 just as my article argued from Scripture .\nIt was not much of a gamble to publish that claim .\nThe numerous prerequisite events ( listed below ) could not have possibly been completed in such a short time .\nIt was as safe as stating that the moon will not descend to earth .\nJust as it would take some major new force or event for the moon to descend , likewise Jesus is not descending here until certain unprecedented events happen .\nThe requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still not present .\nAs history consistently shows , the real gamble is stating when Jesus will come back or the year of the fulfillment of any other Biblical prophecy , for that matter\u2014unless you have a prophetic revelation from God on that , like the Biblical prophets were known to receive .\n( When it 's not speculation or Bible interpretation but the Word of God then it 's not a gamble . )\nAfter that year passed , I updated this article and went on record again for the next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would again expect or predict the Second Coming for that year .\nI also knew that just as with 2007 , the requirements were not present and it would not and did not happen .\nEvery year since then I have updated this article to let people know that the requirements for Jesus to come back that year are simply not present : That 's fourteen ( 16 ) years so far of going out on record that Jesus will not come back in the next year .\nWhy point this out ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ horn ? ''\nWas n't I just lucky ?\nNo .\nReally I point to my track record to help people who are looking for a different approach and answer in this area than is typical of prophecy researchers out there .\nThe vast majority of prophecy experts either : \u2022 Make `` invented prophecy '' predictions that always fail ( because they are invented , or read into one or more verses ) whether they are specific or vague ( `` something big will happen '' ) ... \u2022 ... or claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if Jesus is coming in the next year or not .\nThese views keep the church in alternatively fear and anxiety or confusion and ignorance .\nIn contrast , I have consistently gone on record that popular predictions wo n't happen and I have shown how we can at least rule out Jesus ' coming in certain years , especially in the short term .\nFor people trying to find someone worth listening to on prophecy , a distinction like this is very helpful to note .\nThe Secret to My Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my secret ?\nAnd how can knowing it help you avoid being confused or troubled by the invented prophecy predictions made every year about the Second Coming and other prophecies ?\nMy secret is recognizing the many major events listed in prophecy that must come before Jesus `` returns to earth . ''\nIf you recognize these prerequisite events in your own Bible , too , you will be far ahead of most prophecy researchers in terms of discernment .\nMore importantly , you wo n't fall for their predictions anymore .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge ?\nBecause most Christians are taught to believe in the `` pretrib rapture '' doctrine and the related doctrine of `` imminency . ''\nThis imminency doctrine states that the `` pretrib rapture can come at any moment without any prerequisite event . ''\nJust as the pretrib rapture is false and unscriptural , so is the imminency teaching used to justify it .\nIt 's false because there is no plain verse saying that `` Jesus can come back at any moment '' or `` without any prerequisite . ''\nInstead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things that perhaps could be `` because the Second Coming is imminent . ''\nFor example , Jesus said `` always be ready '' ( Lk 12:40 ) .\nDid he say that because he can come any second ( again , not stated elsewhere in the Bible ) ... or because when you backslide you can become deceived with the `` strong delusion '' ( 2Th 2:11 ) and miss or misunderstand the signs of Jesus ' coming ( 1Th 5:4-5 ) as the religious Jews did before ( clearly taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` imminency '' is not biblical , then how can it be so popular ?\nTwo reasons : \u2022 Few Christians are Bible experts able to discern whether a doctrine they hear from other Christians is really taught by the Bible or not .\n\u2022 Further , this doctrine is telling them exactly what they want to hear , so they are not looking to disprove it .\nAs alluded to earlier , Christians naturally hope that Jesus will come back soon for many reasons .\nAt the very least they are fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to him cleaning it up .\nThe idea that `` Jesus can come at any moment '' or any year sounds wonderful and comforting .\nRemember , most Christians prefer comfort to inconvenient truth when push comes to shove .\nDespite supposed imminency , here we are nearly 2000 years after Jesus left without his return .\nIs n't it time to move on from the dubious doctrine of imminency ( along with the pretrib rapture ) ?\nIf Jesus ' coming was really `` imminent '' for every single one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 AD , why has he not shown up ?\nWhy Jesus has not come back yet is not commonly understood .\nIn simple terms , contrary to what most Christians believe and are taught , Jesus said that there are indeed prerequisites to his return and the start of his reign in the Millennium .\nUntil these preliminary events happen , he said that the `` end is not yet/by and by '' ( Mt 24:6 ; Lk 21:9 ) and he will not be appearing .\nHe can not come until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not here yet .\nWhere do I get all this ?\nStraight from the Bible as read plainly at face value ( John 10:35 ) .\nIt is hard to read it that way until you put any preconceptions ( and emotionally-charged hopes ) aside .\nOnce you do , this literal approach unlocks a sequence of future events described in the key prophecies of Revelation , Daniel , and Jesus ( in Mt 24 ) .\nPut together properly , these prophecies draw a roadmap revealing what we are to expect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1:1 ) .\nUnfortunately , it is not easy to do this .\nMany Bible prophecies are labeled difficult `` mysteries '' ( Rev 10:7 ; 17:5 , 7 ) or call for `` understanding '' and `` wisdom '' ( Dan 12:10 ; Mt 24:15 ; Rev 13:18 ) .\nAs such , it is like putting together a large jigsaw puzzle\u2014a puzzle where you have to scavenge for and identify the pieces first if you will .\nThe pieces to this puzzle are not all conveniently in one place and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both the Old and New Testament .\nSimilar to working with a real jigsaw puzzle , if you have one piece out of place , it can stop you from completing the puzzle to see the picture that it was intended to reveal .\nThe surer you are about that out-of-place piece being right , the more blocked you will be .\nFor example , having the Rapture in the wrong place ( before the Great Tribulation ) in the sequence of events effectively blocks understanding of end-time prophecy .\nIf you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end-time prophecy puzzle pieces , the picture emerges that there is much more than just the Great Tribulation , Rapture , and Second Coming ahead ( which is what sums up the eschatology of most Christians ) .\nThere are more events ahead than Christians have imagined .\nImportantly , most of these unknown prophetic events precede the Second Coming .\nThat means the Second Coming or the Rapture are not `` next '' or `` imminent . ''\nIn other words , if Jesus ' return to earth is `` Event C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until `` Event B '' has already happened .\nLikewise , `` Event B '' will not be seen unless `` Event A '' has already been fulfilled .\nIt 's really that simple : Now , if hypothetical Event A has not happened , this means that the end has not even begun .\nBut does that mean we can not have any clue at all as to when the end is or when the end is not ?\nThankfully , no .\nAlthough the exact timing of Jesus ' Second Coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as Jesus said in Matthew 24:36 `` no man knows the day or hour '' ( read : exact time ) , that does not mean that the general public will never know the exact time even after nearly two millennia have passed .\nNor does it preclude a few with the wisdom of God from knowing the timing before the general public does !\nJesus never said , `` no man WILL EVER know . ''\nEven before then , you can be sure that the end is `` not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) without knowing absolutely when it will be yet .\nWe can do this by working from the relatively few potential years of his return to rule out the many years when he can not come .\nThe potential years come from the many timing clues given in the end-time prophecies .\nThis is similar to how we can know what years are not leap years and which are .\nA leap year is almost always every fourth year , in the years divisible by four\u2014but not divisible by 100 unless also divisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , that 2096 and 2104 will be leap years but not 2100 .\nWith similar use of rules-based logic , we can know what years Jesus can not return ahead of time .\nAs long as the end times and Revelation roadmap have not begun , this fact itself continually rules out the next several years from Jesus ' appearing .\nThis is because the missing prerequisite events on the roadmap take substantial time to play out , several years , in fact .\nThis describes exactly the situation we have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written , in a holding pattern waiting for the first end-time event .\nUnmistakably , therefore `` the end is not yet . ''\n( Note that other prophecies not related to the final seven years have been fulfilled , such as the resurgence of Israel in 1948 per Isaiah 11:10-12 and also the fulfillment of Paul 's `` last days people '' prophecy here in the last decade ) If the Body of Christ had understood Jesus ' words on the preconditions of his coming , they would not be pronouncing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus every year , just the same as we would not pronounce a new US president every single year .\nBecause few believers have understood these overlooked prerequisites , each generation has naturally maintained hope that perhaps they were already in the end times and that Jesus could come back at any moment .\nYet this has been proven to be false hope .\nThen what typically happens is that we justify this belief through other misread prophecies .\nFor example , some might see a world figure who seems to fit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a technological development that seems to fulfill the mark of the beast ( like bar codes or bio-chips ) and conclude that it is a sign that the time must be near or in their lifetime .\nThat kind of reasoning has been used innumerable times and always resulted in disappointment .\nIt is important to put aside these pseudo-signs and look only to the real milestones listed in the Bible if you want to correctly know when there really is something prophetic coming to worry about .\nGiven the fact that none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is safe to say that it is impossible for Jesus to come in 2021\u2014or any year this decade of the 2020s !\nSo , what are these prerequisite events ?\nHere are several examples from my book starting with the first event to come : \u2022 Psalm 83/Isaiah 17 War - Damascus Destroyed/Second Holocaust \u2014 Rather than the Rapture , the next event in prophecy is a swift nuclear war in the Middle East between Israel and many of her Arab/Islamic neighbors .\nYou do not need a Bible to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear one due to the tensions between Israel and the Arabs and Iran ( not Arab , but Persian ) .\nThe concern over Iran 's uranium enrichment program has only added to this .\nThe outcome of this war will be the destruction of Damascus ( Isa 17:1 ) and several other major Arab cities and regions , along with enough devastation in Israel to classify it a second holocaust !\nObviously , this event has still not happened because Damascus remains a city to this day ( whether you consider it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World nation standards or not : - ) .\nIf you are wondering when this will happen , God gave me dreams that lead me to conclude the year 2022 .\n\u2022 The Sixth Seal/Wormwood \u2014 If you read Revelation 6:12-17 carefully you will see that it depicts the entire world panicking and running for cover in response to signs in the heavens and a tremendous global earthquake on earth that shakes every mountain and island out of place .\nIt is obvious that a global cataclysm like this has not happened since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written .\nThis event is a `` sign of the end '' that Jesus told his followers to expect when they asked about his return ( Mt 24:7-8=Lk 21:10-11=Joel 2:30-32=Rev 6:12-17 ) .\nGod 's end-time escape instructions shared by Jesus , Joel , and Revelation would then become relevant for the faithful .\n( By the way , ignore anyone saying they have pictures of Wormwood since it is not here yet . )\n\u2022 Third Temple \u2014 Several passages describe a Third Temple on the Temple Mount with sacrifices going during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mt 24:15 ; 2Th 2:3-4 ) .\nThe Antichrist is even going to sit in this end-time temple as part of his declaration of himself as God ( 2Th 2:4 ) .\nObviously , there is as yet still no temple or even a construction project underway for one , nor sacrifices yet .\nSpeaking of the construction , some say that everything is already being prepared for this temple and it can go up fast , in less than a year .\nEven if that 's true , under the current political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Temple Mount without the Arab 's approval given their historic belligerence against any Jewish worship on the Temple Mount .\nThe Arab control and power need to be broken first , and that is not going to happen without a war , probably the future Psalm 83 war as above .\n\u2022 The Abomination of Desolation \u2014 The Great Tribulation starts 30 days ( as in the 1290 - 1260 days ) after the Abomination of Desolation is `` stood '' up at the Temple Mount ( Mk 13:14 ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Beast statue being erected for worship ( Rev 13:14 ) .\nAt the same time , the Third Temple sacrifices are halted by the Antichrist .\nThis is another unfulfilled prophecy as only the Antichrist can accomplish this and he is not here yet .\n\u2022 Great Tribulation \u2014 This is the most obvious and well-known end-time event .\nAccording to Daniel 9:27 = Matthew 24:21 , Jesus must return after a period of `` Great Tribulation . ''\nDuring this Great Tribulation , the Antichrist will rule over the world for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He will force all the unsaved ( Rev 13:8 ) to take a mark in their right hand or forehead during that time .\nPlainly , we are not in the Great Tribulation and no mark of the beast has been issued yet .\n\u2022 The Rapture \u2014 The Rapture comes after the Great Tribulation or post-trib , yet not to save anyone from any threat on earth as Christians suppose .\nThe Rapture arrives right on time for the faithful to be `` rewarded '' ( Rev 11:18 ) with glorified eternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can then rule for the entire 1000 year Millennium along with those in the first resurrection ( Rev 20:4-5 ) .\n( But you have to qualify for the Rapture by listening to what Jesus said to do . )\n\u2022 The Wrath of God/7 Bowls \u2014 The seven bowls of God 's wrath immediately fall when the faithful leave temporarily to heaven ( Rev 15:5-8 ) apparently for the marriage supper of the lamb ( Rev 19:9 ) , just as Jesus described in saying it would be just like as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is taken ( the righteous ) and one is left ( the wicked ) .\n\u2022 The Second Coming \u2014 Finally , Jesus `` returns to earth '' on Yom Kippur/The Day of the LORD to fight the Battle of Armageddon ( Rev 19:11-21 ) .\nHe brings back with him the raptured and resurrected saints from the marriage supper of the lamb ( Rev 19:9 ) in Heaven ( Rev 15:5-8 ) .\nThen they/we reign for the Millennium on earth\u2014not in heaven .\nThese are only some of the events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my comprehensive book : Nevertheless , the above list does include the `` Event A '' from my earlier explanation : the Psalm 83 War .\nUntil we see that event , the end time roadmap/final seven years has not begun .\nThis has meant in the past that we could still have years or even a decade ( or two ? )\nbefore the end times events start and finish with Jesus ' return .\nSince the events of 2020 , I feel we are definitely under a decade now until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unlike Tim , I think we have this decade safe and next decade looks very suspicious as a possible decade for Jesus ' return based on what I see happening in the world at the moment .\nBUT let 's not get lazy- our life can end at any moment and then our time is up already .\nPlus , if we do n't take our time seriously in becoming more Christ-like now every day , we wo n't be ready for end-time events when they do come .\nTim intended to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become more Christ-like , thus becoming prepared for the end-times , but did not find the way to write it before he passed .\nI have been diligently working on materials for this purpose and have it on a separate site because it is information that is truly essential for those who study Bible Prophecy AND those who choose to look away from prophecy- every Believer .\nIf you want that website press on this highlighted text .\nNow back to Tim ... ) For sure , as long as the Damascus war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good minimum of seven years before Jesus can come back , which is the length of the 70th Week of Daniel time frame in which all but one of the events above must take place .\n( Katrina 's note- Right now the war in Syria looks like it 's on a back-burner , more reconstruction than destruction has happened in Damascus in 2022 and it will most likely continue like that in 2023 .\nDoes the Damascus war involve an ultra-religious right-wing government in Israel to happen ?\nWill the Iranian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole region into a war just to cling on to power ?\nWill Assad have Russian support to destabilize the region ?\nIt is all up in the air and we can only watch it unfold . )\nThe Prophetic `` Sabbath Years '' Narrow It Down Even Further Usually , you can rule out Jesus ' coming even more than seven years in advance .\nHow ?\nThrough the special insight that Jesus can only return in one out of every seven years : a Sabbath year .\nThe Sabbath year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a blessing of a year of rest from planting their fields with the associated promise of bounty in the sixth year before that .\nIt also was prophetic like all the Torah ( Mt 5:17-18 ) .\nThat means it had an end-time meaning and fulfillment .\nThe fulfillment of the Sabbath year is that it pictures the Millennium peace and rest , the 1000-year period that begins with Jesus ' return .\nJust as the ancient Israelites rested their fields and experienced God 's blessing , provision , and peace in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth during the Millennium ( and after ) .\nPutting this together , it means that the final seven years or 70th week of Daniel ( Dan 9:27 ) are aligned on a Sabbath year cycle or a `` week of years '' ( Dan 9:26 ) .\nThis cycle consists of six regular years followed by a special Sabbath year .\nJesus returns in that final Sabbath year of the 70th Week , whenever that is .\nIt 's impossible for him to return during one of the six non-Sabbath years .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ years on the calendar , right off the bat !\nFor example , here in 2021 , we are in the Sabbath year cycle of 2017-2024 .\nBecause of the missing events listed above , it 's impossible for this cycle to be the one Jesus returns in .\nThat rules out the entire period from 2017-2024 and makes the next period the first possible after that ( 2024-2030 ) .\nThis means Jesus can not return from 2021-2029 .\n2030 is the next possible Sabbath year for Jesus ' return .\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aligned on Sabbath year cycles , see my free study on that .\n2026 - Why I 'm Convinced It 's the Year the End Starts If 2030 is the year Jesus returns , then the 70th week spans 2024-2030 , ending in the fall 6 months before the Sabbath year completes in spring , 2031 because `` he cuts short the time '' ( Mt 24:22 ) .\nBut that does not mean the bad stuff or `` beginning of sorrows '' starts in 2024 .\nIt actually would begin in 2026 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is why I 'm sad to report that the closer we get to it , the more confirmation keeps falling into my lap about it , despite my not wanting it to be true .\nFor example , I already have had several dreams and developments in my own life that led me to share publicly why I am convinced the end begins in 2026 .\nThen in 2017 , when Trump announced the decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel 's capital and move the US Embassy to Jerusalem , God gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for confirmation about 2026 for obvious reasons , but it came anyway in a remarkable fashion : a dream in three separate interrupted sleep segments .\nThat morning I released my article on how God had confirmed through the dream that Trump 's provocative announcement was prophetic and leading to the nuclear Middle East war .\nIt was very angering to the Muslims with immediate demonstrations and followed by calls to make a bigger Arab alliance against Israel .\nMany others have written me since then to say they also heard from God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards end-time prophecy .\nBut time will tell on that and whether I understood my dream properly ( 1Co 14:26 , 29 ) .\nFurther confirmation came in early 2019 .\nIf asked I would have told you that no end-time prophecy had been fulfilled so far until Damascus is gone .\nBut I would have been wrong .\nI was overlooking Paul 's `` last days people '' prophecy ( 2Ti 3:1-3 ) which I could never understand and ignored for 20 years .\nAn inspiration struck me that finally demystified it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how a seductive recent technology has brought out the worst in people in all 19 ways Paul predicted !\nHow COVID-19 Confirms No More Delay 2020 's events are the greatest confirmation so far that the end is now due this decade .\nThis is ironic because , as I 've shared previously , I did not see this early downturn of civilization coming .\nThere is no pandemic in Bible prophecy before the pestilence Jesus spoke of that is associated with Wormwood 's global devastation ( the earthquakes , famine , pestilence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just happen naturally and by chance , now , as scientists conclude ?\nOr was COVID-19 part of God 's plan for humanity , just as Wormwood is ?\nI see a pattern in this event that makes me conclude the latter .\nIn hindsight , something akin to 2020 's lockdowns , restrictions , economic devastation , and isolation had to happen .\nThe pandemic has provided what Jesus told this generation to pray for : `` gold refined in the fire '' of trials bad enough to bring us to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is Jesus ' prescription for the illness of spiritual poverty , nakedness , and blindness that characterize `` Laodiceans '' like us who have lived rich , sensual , comfortable lives in the modern world .\nWhen Jesus said that it was hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom , this is why ( Mt 19:23 ) .\nWe do not need God nor do we get sufficiently humbled and aligned with love when life is working for us pretty well as is .\nJesus 3 Tests of Whether You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , but if you live in the developed world , you qualify as rich by the standard of Jesus ' day .\nWhat he said about the rich not entering the kingdom applies to you .\nOdds are that you are not yet saved or headed to the kingdom .\nYou may believe in God and want to serve him but belief and intention are not enough according to Jesus ' own words demanding we bear fruit of a radically changed life .\nHere are three requirements found in Jesus ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u2022 Are you `` as humble as a child '' ( Mt 18:3-4 ) ?\n\u2022 Does your `` righteousness exceed that of the Scribes and Pharisees '' who were zealous for God , too ( Mt 5:20 ) ?\n\u2022 Is your life philosophy to love others for God ( Mt 7:12=Mt 7:21 ) so you bear fruit and do n't hear `` depart from me I never knew you '' ( Mt 7:23 ) ?\nIf not , do n't feel ashamed to admit it .\nChristianity did not teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Jesus did with his followers .\nGod is really the only teacher for making us ready for the kingdom .\nYou need that gold refined in the fire to become the bride of Christ who God protects in the end .\nThat is why COVID-19 happened now and why I 'm so convinced it is confirmation that the end is about to begin .\nThe bride is getting the `` makeover '' that she needs through this disruption to life as we are used to it .\nSince the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process in my life , my household , and the saints I fellowship with .\nI have heard testimonies from several readers about God also leading their lives into hard times that brought them closer to him than ever .\nWithout COVID-19 or something like it , we would mostly be stuck poor , naked , and blind spiritually , lacking the faith and trust in God to be able to escape all these things .\nTo see COVID-19 as necessary for us and part of God 's loving plan for us makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality easier .\nThe next step is to then ask God what he has for you to learn in this with the time we have left before the end begins .\nTo summarize , while I 'm happy to say that the end ca n't come this year or even in the next few years , sadly developments like COVID-19 have convinced me that the end is starting this decade , probably in 2026 : - ( .\nCommon Objections To Hearing Jesus Ca n't Come Back To state that Jesus is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the rest of the decade , too ) may sound plain wrong or at least arrogant to many .\nMost do n't realize Jesus himself said `` the end is not yet '' and gave the conditions for discerning that ourselves ( Mt 24:6 ; Lk 21:9 ) .\nTo help you see the truth of what Jesus plainly said about not expecting his return until `` the end '' conditions arrive , here are a few of the common objections I hear with my responses : Objection # 1 : `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to last as long as you say ... '' People often point to the multiplying and worsening problems in the world as proof that `` the end is nigh '' ... ( for sure this time ! )\n.\nHowever , if you study history , every generation has been able to point to something getting worse as proof that they were the `` last generation '' yet here we are .\nRelative and subjective arguments like that do n't compare to the absolute specific description Jesus gave of the end-time sign .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a thief in the night , by surprise , so you wo n't have any clue as to years ... '' There are verses implying that Jesus will come suddenly and unexpectedly like a `` thief in the night '' ( 1Th 5:2 ; 2Pe 3:10 ) .\nHowever , if you check out the passages in their context you will find that this thief-like surprise applies to the world and not to the `` sons of light and sons of the day '' ( 1Th 5:4 ) !\nGod 's children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophecy '' about the circumstances of the coming of Jesus , a few of which this article has shared above .\nIf Christians keep them in mind , they will not find that Jesus ' coming surprises them like the world ( 1Th 5:4 ) .\nObjection # 3 : `` You 're claiming to know the day or hour ! ''\nSome always argue that my proclamation about 2021 ( 2023 ) contradicts `` no man knows the day or the hour '' ( Mt 24:36 ) .\nThis seems valid at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already above about Jesus ' statement not meaning we were forever prohibited from knowing .\nThe public will know when the end is close , once it is .\nAlso , a prohibition on knowing when something will happen does not mean you do n't have enough clues to know certain times when it can not possibly happen .\nFor example , say a friend tells you he will drop by on one of his days off to catch up , but he does not tell you which one .\nYou do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which means `` time '' ) of his coming .\nYet say you know his day off from work is Saturday .\nWould you sit there on Sunday or Monday hoping or believing he might just come `` today ? ''\nOr would you know he ca n't be coming that day for a major visit like he promised ?\nThe answer is obvious .\nIt is the same with Jesus ' Second Coming .\nAlthough the absolute timing of his coming is not publicly known , we still can know many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his own words .\nJesus ' coming has conditions and circumstances to it that mean he can not come just any random time even if we do n't know the-one-and-only-time he will come .\nObjection # 4 : `` You 're effectively telling Christians to relax and not be ready for the return .\n( Shame on you ! )\n'' Others complain that to say `` Jesus is not coming this year '' translates to saying people do n't have to be alert , pray and stay close to God ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus can not come back soon does not change anything about needing to `` always be ready '' and not backslide into sin .\nAlso , we all are still mortal .\nWe can lose our life tomorrow through `` time and chance '' that the Bible says happens to us all ( Ecc 9:11-12 ) .\nBecause we can `` meet our maker '' at any moment , we `` always need to be ready '' as Jesus taught ( Mt 24:44 ; Lk 12:40 ) .\nUltimately , let 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this message that `` the end is not yet '' ; or `` the end is not by and by '' ( Mk 13:7 ; Lk 21:9 ) until certain ( unmistakable ) global conditions appear .\nJesus did not teach `` imminency '' or to expect his coming any and every day .\nInstead , He encouraged constant prayer and vigilance to not allow yourself to backslide because you do n't know when you will die or when he will come ( Lk 12:45 ) .\nSo , rather than this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a clear advantage to it compared to the popular `` the end is nigh '' thinking which focuses people on something that is not going to happen yet .\nThe continual `` invented prophecy '' predictions about the end coming around every corner every year keep many people in fear .\nThat needless anxiety ( Php 4:6 ; Mt 6:25 ) can lead people to live under costly short-term thinking and make very poor decisions for themselves and their families .\nI 've seen many sad cases of this ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I still had not discovered what this article shares ) .\nIt truly is better to know the truth and act off of that\u2014prayerfully and righteously\u2014rather than act off a misunderstanding that opens you up to constant false alarms or paranoia or influences you to make bad choices or live in dread .\nThe popular hope and expectation that Jesus is coming `` this year '' persists among Christians despite a `` no show '' every year so far .\nNot surprisingly , it turns out that this belief is based more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that `` the pretrib rapture is the next event in prophecy '' is mainly to blame for this .\nThat the Second Coming can happen imminently or without lead-up events breaks Scripture ( John 10:35 ) and is to be rejected by Bereans who test religious doctrine against God 's revelation ( Acts 17:11 ) .\nScripture teaches that there are prerequisites or events that must come first .\nIf we put aside popular Christian speculation and prophecy invention and consult the Bible 's prophetic roadmap directly , we can know that Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nEven more , he wo n't return for several years after that for sure because of Sabbath year cycles .\nI agree that it is disappointing to hear that Jesus is not coming in 2021 ( 2023 ) or any time soon after that .\nThe good part of this is that by the same principle , many bad things like Wormwood and the Great Tribulation are also certain to not come next year either !\nIt means you can stop worrying about the end coming suddenly and unexpectedly as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of no prerequisite events continues .\nYou can focus instead on making sure you are saved by getting right with God through Biblical repentance .\nMy best writing for preparing yourself teaches how to not lose your faith when bad things happen ( including when everyone knows God caused them ! )\n.\nIf you are interested in learning all the things you do not have to worry about in 2021 ( 2023 ) without it taking years of personal study and/or in supporting this ministry and `` help get the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Know the Future offered on this site .\nOrders directly support my writing of free articles .\n( Katrina 's note- orders help me keep the website up and support me in writing more articles ) .\nIf you want help on seeking the narrow path Jesus spoke about as the only one `` leading to life '' that `` few find , '' my supporter content will help you greatly .\n( Katrina 's note- I still add special content for only supporters to read . )\nIf you want to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer the question that people always email me on `` When do you think the end is ?
