be honest : I haven \u2019 t listened to even a single episode of Joe Rogan \u2019 s podcast .\nBut I \u2019 m aware of the controversy surrounding some episodes he did at the end of 2021 , namely with Dr. Malone and Dr. McCullough .\nThe world is now freaking out about all of the \u201c misinformation \u201d Joe has spread , and demanding that he apologize , never invite unapproved guests again , and some are even calling for him to be kicked off .\nJoe has actually apologized , a bit , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had .\nBut he shouldn \u2019 t .\nHe has absolutely nothing to apologize for .\nWhy Joe Rogan Should Not Apologize Joe Rogan is not a \u201c conspiracy theorist \u201d ( and I \u2019 m going to use that term loosely , because certain things that were considered mere conspiracy theories in early 2022 \u2014 like that COVID could have leaked from a lab \u2014 are now legitimate scientific possibilities ) .\nInstead , Rogan is a person who talks to a wide range of people .\nHe doesn \u2019 t take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being said ; he just opens up the conversation .\nRogan has had scientists on his podcast who fully believe the mainstream COVID narrative and have encouraged people to stay home , wear masks , and get vaccinated .\nHis podcast has not been , in any way , one-sided .\nNeither Dr. Malone nor Dr. McCullough are \u201c conspiracy theorists , \u201d either .\nThey are highly-regarded , credentialed experts in their fields .\nDr. McCullough is a cardiologist who is the most published researcher in his field .\nDr. Malone holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the COVID vaccines are based .\nBoth are legitimate experts\u2026who happen to have a different view of the available scientific evidence .\nOnce , we celebrated differences , and encouraged discussion and debate .\nIt used to be that anyone who understood the evidence could have a seat at the table and openly disagree .\nThat \u2019 s literally how we learn , how we become better \u2014 we challenge each other , we explore new ideas and interpretations .\nBut now , the illiberal left ( they \u2019 re not liberals \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in new ideas , being tolerant of others with different thoughts and beliefs ) has decided there can be only one correct answer .\nHow they decided which experts are \u201c real \u201d and which are \u201c quacks , \u201d I don \u2019 t know , since an increasing number of highly-credentialed individuals have been branded as \u201c quacks \u201d in recent years .\nMaybe they flip a coin ?\nOr maybe they follow the experts who net them the most profit .\nRegardless of how they do it , they have absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how intelligent , science-based , or well-informed \u2014 who does not blindly agree with the \u201c science \u201d of the day .\nThey consider anyone ( again , including people who have far more expertise than they do ) who does not toe the line to be \u201c dangerous.\n\u201d Legitimate scientific debate is not a thing , and alternate theories are now \u201c misinformation.\n\u201d Saying on social media in the spring of 2022 that COVID may have leaked from a lab would get you banned .\nSaying that cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preventing the virus ( vs. properly fitted N95 masks ) would also get you banned .\nToday , the mainstream media reports these as legitimate truth .\nThere was a debate to be had , and evidence to support both sides , but one group of people decided what \u201c truth \u201d was and that was it .\nUntil they changed their minds .\nWe \u2019 re in a very dangerous situation , indeed \u2014 but it \u2019 s not because of \u201c misinformation.\n\u201d It \u2019 s because the powers-that-be are absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have a voice , and they can \u2019 t control what the population hears , sees , and thinks anymore .\nThey are unable to squash debate even as they vociferously proclaim that there aren \u2019 t two sides to any of these issues .\nThey scream at people who think or feel differently that they are uneducated , wrong , stupid , and \u201c trying to politicize \u201d things .\n( Apparently , it \u2019 s not political to say there \u2019 s only one right opinion and use your political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and force your will on them .\nComplaining about being silenced and forced is what makes it political . )\nAll of this to say\u2026Joe Rogan should not apologize .\nHe has absolutely nothing to apologize for .\nHe tried to give different sides an equal platform , and let the public make up their own minds \u2014 which is exactly what should be happening .\nWhat Should Happen Instead The American public , on the whole , isn \u2019 t stupid .\nPeople are capable of hearing from multiple sources and making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be different , based on their own in-born personalities , political leanings , risk tolerance , health status , and more .\nThat \u2019 s completely normal and fine .\nWe can not tell people how they should think and feel .\nAt least , we should not , although some people do .\nWe have to allow them to take in all the evidence , filter it through their own experiences and ideas , and make their own decisions .\nEven if we don \u2019 t like , agree , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down alternative voices has done nothing but make the silencers seem irrational and hateful .\nThe public \u2019 s interest in these issues has grown massively over the last two years , in part because of the attempts to silence it .\nThey have to wonder what is so bad that they aren \u2019 t supposed to know about it .\nSo why don \u2019 t we just allow a true open debate ?\nIf one side has no merit , then we should be able to see that via the thoughts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Rogan should invite both Dr. McCullough and Dr. Malone back to his podcast .\nHe can invite Dr. Fauci and Dr. Hotez ( or whoever wants to represent the mainstream side ) to come on , too \u2014 at the same time .\nLet the experts bring their studies and their evidence and their experiences and honestly debate each other .\nNo character assassinations .\nNo focus on \u201c credibility \u201d ( based on completely made-up qualifiers ) .\nIt \u2019 s all about the actual evidence .\nLet the experts speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about why they believe X is true , or Y isn \u2019 t .\nThis will be how we learn .\nBy giving both sides an honest listen .\nBy speaking freely .\nIf someone truly is very wrong , it will become clear when they can \u2019 t produce any evidence to support their conclusions , or when the other side can produce a lot of evidence that explains why they \u2019 re wrong .\nIs the illiberal left afraid of this debate ?\nAre they so sure they \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t even need to talk about it or examine the science ?\nOr are the willing to actually hear someone out who doesn \u2019 t live inside their precious echo chamber ?\nOur world is fractured .\nAnd it \u2019 s fractured because of this insistence that there is only one right way to think , be , and live .\nThe only way back to some semblance of peace is to actually listen to each other , to hear each other out with open minds , to stop branding others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d \u201c stupid , \u201d and all the other names simply for having a difference of opinion .\nCan we actually do that ?\nOr will the illiberals learn nothing and continue to try to squash legitimate debate \u2014 to their own detriment ?\n( Those of us who see the science differently and can support our views with evidence aren \u2019 t going away . )\nI hope to see these debates soon , or I fear our country is in for an extremely difficult future , with a verbal civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who gets to control the narrative and who gets to be \u201c right.\n\u201d For now ?\nJoe Rogan and others like him have nothing to apologize for , and they need to stand up and say so , loud and proud .\nIt \u2019 s the only chance we have .\nDo you think Joe Rogan should apologize or be canceled

"content": "I have a small obsession with adding to my garden .\nAnd since we moved to our homestead 4 years ago , I have plenty of space to do so .\nBut not everyone has that much space .\nAnd right now , a lot of people don \u2019 t have much money , either .\nWhen that \u2019 s the case , growing potatoes in old 55-gal drums might be just the thing !\nThis is our third year growing potatoes and I \u2019 ll be honest \u2014 we didn \u2019 t get the harvest I wanted the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping I \u2019 ve learned from that , and I \u2019 ll see a great harvest this year .\nI \u2019 m sharing with you what I learned about this in case you want to try it , too !\nHow to Source and Prepare Materials The picture above is my garden set up from the beginning of 2021 .\nI had 10 55-gallon drums lined up along the edge of the garden .\nI got these drums from Earthley \u2014 they previously held organic alcohol , and we cleaned them out well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurants to see if they have empty drums , too .\nAny that held food ( like oils , alcohol , dry goods ) previously will be safe to use for your garden .\nAvoid any that held harsh or toxic chemicals , which is common in industrial manufacturing .\nAsk questions to know for sure what used to be in those drums !\nCut the lids off the drums so they are open .\nDrill drainage holes around the bottom , too .\nThe holes in mine are about 1/2\u2033 wide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you do not have access to 55-gal drums , you can also use chicken wire ( wrapped into a circle with straw and zip ties ) or these 20-gallon grow bags .\nFor soil , we started out using a mix of sand from our creek and potting soil .\nThis wasn \u2019 t ideal .\nPotato plants definitely grew , as you can see in the picture above !\nAnd they definitely made potatoes .\nJust not very many of them .\nThe theory with these 55-gallon drums was that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drum throughout the growing season , the plant would keep producing potatoes in layers , so that a small number of plants would produce 100 lbs .\nor more all through the drum .\nI did not find this to be true .\nThe potatoes all grew in the same layer .\nSome people have said that planting the potatoes in layers rather than all at once will make it work better , but the whole thing just did not seem to be ideal .\nI did it twice in different ways ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year ; trying to be more proactive about hilling it up ) and did not get good results either way .\nHow to Grow Potatoes in 55-Gallon Drums This is the system I finally arrived at .\nWe cut the drums in half to be each around 18\u2033 tall , then lined them up like this .\nWe cut a circle of 1 1/2\u2033 holes around the side of the drums as well to increase drainage , because potatoes don \u2019 t like to be in very wet soil .\nThe open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep weeds down , at least for a short time !\nWe mixed soil on the tarp , which consisted of : It cost around $ 100 to buy the soil to fill all of these about half full\u2026which is not bad !\nI recommend mixing soil from your own yard with compost and perlite to keep costs down .\nYou can also use sawdust , straw , and grass clippings .\nI planted 5 potatoes in each of the larger barrels , and 4 potatoes each in the grow bags .\nThen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will do again as they grow .\nWith this system , the potatoes have a lot more room to grow .\nThey were a lot easier to plant , and will be a lot easier to harvest .\n( The full drums were HEAVY !\nAnd hard to tip over , dig through , and clean up again . )\nI also planted kale in the center of a few of the drums , because they are good companion plants .\nI haven \u2019 t tried this before , but I \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ll find out !\nI will update this post in the fall , when we see the

of the country \u2019 s formula supply .\nParents are scrambling to find the food their babies need , especially families whose babies require special formulas .\nFormula is being rationed in stores across the country , in an attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not just those who get there first .\nThis has led to a fight about \u201c what now.\n\u201d How do we cope with a lack of formula ?\nSome are touting breastfeeding as the ultimate answer ; others say it \u2019 s not that simple , and even insulting to families who are unable to breastfeed and struggling to feed their babies now .\nThe truth is\u2026there \u2019 s an entire , overarching conversation to be had here .\nSo let \u2019 s have it .\nI ask this not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topic .\nWhy are so many mothers needing formula in the first place ?\n84 % of women initiate breastfeeding , but just 46 % are still exclusively doing so by 3 months postpartum .\nThat means that over half of infants are getting at least some formula during their first year .\nAlthough strides have been taken in hospitals to be more baby-friendly , including immediate breastfeeding initiation , rooming-in , on-staff lactation consultants , avoiding formula in the first 2 days of life unless the mother does not want to breastfeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more work to be done .\nFormula companies routinely send samples to mothers who have registered at any baby store , indicating that they are expecting .\nSome hospitals still send moms home with formula gift bags , including samples and coupons .\nWorse , some formula companies write articles about the \u201c importance of breastfeeding , \u201d but give advice that undermines breastfeeding success ( like \u201c keep a can of formula on hand \u2018 just in case ' \u201d ) .\nWhile formula should be available for moms who need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on mothers so readily .\nAgain , there has been an increase in support available .\nMany hospitals have lactation consultants on staff , and more insurance companies are covering lactation visits and breast pumps .\nHowever , not every mom has access to a lactation consultant .\nThere may not be one in her area , or it may not be affordable , or the available consultants may be booked up .\nIf breastfeeding is painful or baby is not latching well , it \u2019 s important to be seen quickly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby is getting enough to eat .\nThat may not always be possible .\nMothers may also face a lack of support from their families .\nOlder mothers who did not breastfeed may give poor advice or even say that the new mother should not breastfeed .\nFathers may not know what to say , or discourage it .\nOr , even if family is on board , the new mother may be on her own with her newborn mere days after birth , trying to take care of herself as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her new baby .\nMany women give up on breastfeeding because they are squeezed by all of the responsibilities they face \u2014 and something has to give .\nMore and more women are experiencing hormone imbalances , in part due to all of the endocrine disruptors in our environment ( plastics , certain pharmaceutical drugs , fragrances , skin care items , and more ) .\nThese hormonal imbalances can mean that women do not develop proper breast tissue/glands to be able to breastfeed , or that their bodies struggle to produce prolactin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis can lead to low supply , despite moms breastfeeding frequently and following all the best advice .\nUnfortunately , addressing underlying hormone imbalances is not simple , and new mothers are going through a lot of hormone changes anyway .\nIt may not be possible to address in time to save a breastfeeding relationship .\nThere are many more nuanced , personal reasons why women don \u2019 t breastfeed , and it \u2019 s impossible to dig into them all here .\nThese are just three of the biggest ones that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why Talking About Breastfeeding is Tough Right Now ( But Important ) There are women who are very much triggered by breastfeeding even entering into the conversation right now .\nSome tried and tried to breastfeed their babies , and still feel anger and guilt that they weren \u2019 t able to , and don \u2019 t want to be reminded of that now by dismissive social media posts like \u201c this is why you should just breastfeed.\n\u201d Other women simply never wanted to .\nRegardless of why they \u2019 re not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the calls to breastfeed are irrelevant to them .\nAnd their babies need to eat .\nBreastfeeding is still relevant to this conversation , though .\nThere are expecting moms who are on the fence about breastfeeding \u2014 this situation may sway them to try .\nThere are new moms who are still trying and struggling to breastfeed \u2014 they may work harder at it , or seek support they have not yet received , to avoid having to use formula right now .\nThere are also moms who are practicing mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThese moms may be able to get their supply up enough not to need to supplement if they can get support .\nFeeding babies isn \u2019 t black and white , all or nothing .\nFor the women in the middle , they need support for breastfeeding more than ever right now .\nThey have options that women who don \u2019 t produce milk don \u2019 t have .\nBut nothing can change for them unless they can access some new information or assistance .\nThe other reason why this is relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there who are blessed with abundant milk supplies who may be able to share .\nWe should be encouraging the women who are willing to do so\u2026especially for babies with special medical needs who struggle to tolerate most formulas .\nFor those who are worried about sharing , milk can be tested and pasteurized by milk banks ( and for infants with special needs , insurance will often cover the cost ) .\nFor others , it can be a blessing to get milk from another mom directly .\nRegardless , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it is possible !\nOne of the reasons this shut down has been so devastating is because of US governmental regulatory burdens .\nLaws surrounding formula production and labeling are often unnecessarily stringent .\nThese laws have barred new producers from entering the market , including the importing of European brands whose quality and safety standards even outpace the US .\nThis has led to nearly all infant formulas being manufactured by just three major producers .\nAbbott Nutrition ( Similac ) is responsible for a whopping 43 % of the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so concentrated , a few things happen .\nFirst , when a plant goes down , as in this case , it is devastating to supply .\nOther manufacturers can not make up a shortfall that great in a short amount of time .\nManufacturers also have no incentive to improve the quality of infant formulas available .\nFormulas are still not that close to breast milk .\nAnd while it would be nearly impossible to replicate certain aspects of breastmilk \u2014 mother \u2019 s hormones , immunities , probiotics from mother \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are driven and changed by mother \u2019 s diet ( yes , even for the start up Biomilq this could not happen ) , we could do better .\nNot relying on corn syrup solids and using more natural forms of vitamins and minerals would be a great start .\nThis has certainly shown off some serious issues with the formula industry !\nAnd parents should push for real change after this .\nBy the way , some families are ordering European formulas online ( which are sometimes being seized at the border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Amazon and selecting \u201c Canada \u201d as their country in order to obtain formula right now .\nThere is also Baby \u2019 s Only Organic and Sammy \u2019 s Milk , both of which were forced to be labeled as toddler formulas by the FDA , but which meet the nutritional needs of infants .\nAccording to the FDA and CDC , no , absolutely not , do not do it .\nThere are certainly concerns about using a homemade formula .\nThese include : \u2022 Using a recipe that is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk and corn syrup \u2014 please don \u2019 t do that ! )\n\u2022 Improperly mixing the recipe ( resulting in too much or too little sodium \u2014 cow \u2019 s milk is high in sodium \u2014 which can create an emergency for a baby \u2019 s hydration/electrolyte balance ) It is important to pay attention to these issues .\nIf a baby , especially a very young one , can get sick or even die from formula that has not been correctly made .\n( This also applies to store-bought , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby and cause hyponatremia , which can be life-threatening .\nNot sterilizing equipment or not mixing with boiled water can lead to contamination . )\nI wouldn \u2019 t advise using just any recipe you find floating around social media , or trying to create your own without doing a lot of research on baby \u2019 s nutritional needs .\nBut , I also believe that homemade formula is a very viable option , especially right now .\nIf parents can \u2019 t find formula , babies still have to eat !\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d it are dangerous .\nI recommend the Weston A Price Foundation \u2019 s recipe , which has been used for thousands of babies for more than 40 years .\nBe sure to make it precisely , and sterilize equipment properly !\nSome families do not like seeing homemade recipes ever promoted , but I think that \u2019 s a mistake .\nParents deserve all the information so they can make an informed choice in a difficult situation .\nFamilies need to be empowered with options , an ability to be self-sufficient .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own formula for any reason should opt for something different .\nOur world is so upside-down .\nWe should first , be quicker to support and encourage breastfeeding , to help the women who are able , and want to , to be successful with it .\nFewer families should need formula .\n( Grab this free guide to breastfeeding nutrition . )\nWe need to increase access to donor milk , and encourage more women to provide it .\nIt isn \u2019 t a bad idea to pay women a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because women have to take their time , buy bags , clean and maintain a pump , and more .\nPaying them a small amount would increase the availability of donor milk for those who need it .\nAnd we need to value women and their time enough to be willing to do that .\nWe need to have a more diverse array of companies making formula , each with a smaller share of the market ; and we need to have higher-quality options available for those who truly need it .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with important caveats about nutritional composition and safe ways to prepare it .\n( This was normal 60 years ago and without the nutritional balance we have today ! )\nThis

just walk away shaking my head .\nThis is often truest when I search for terms along the lines of \u201c disadvantages of homeschooling.\n\u201d These articles are clearly written by people who have never done a lick of research into homeschooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey bring up concerns that are not remotely concerning to actual homeschoolers , and attempt to dissuade families from trying it based on a complete misunderstanding of what homeschooling actually is .\nIt \u2019 s beyond irresponsible for organizations with some level of \u201c authority \u201d to publish abject lies , further shaking the confidence of families who are already striking out away from the mainstream .\nIt \u2019 s more proof that we should not trust them\u2026how can they educate our children when they come across so poorly educated themselves ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ may run into one or more of these lists .\nAs a veteran homeschooler ( eight years under my belt so far ! )\nand wife to a former homeschooled man , I \u2019 m going to address the common \u201c concerns \u201d on these lists , and set things straight !\nThe Truth About the \u201c Disadvantages to Homeschooling \u201d This is always the first concern homeschoolers hear , and it \u2019 s one almost no actual homeschoolers have .\nIt seems to be predicated on the idea that homeschoolers are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing anyone at all besides their parents .\nPerhaps that was true 40 years ago , when homeschooling was mostly illegal ; and perhaps it is still true in very rural communities .\nBut for the most part , homeschooled kids have more opportunities today than ever .\nThey participate in co-ops , sports teams , scouting , dance classes , music lessons , church groups , and more .\nThey also go out and play with other kids around the neighborhood !\nWhat \u2019 s more , when they are around other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present and available .\nThey are able to get immediate guidance and mentorship if something goes wrong .\nThis is unlike a school playground , where the adult-to-child ratio is very high , and bullying runs rampant .\nPublic school socialization is nothing to brag about !\nBesides , how easily a child gets along with others has a lot more to do with their personality than where they are educated .\nPersonally , I went to public school and am an introvert who does not enjoy being around people much .\nMy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very good at getting along with a wide variety of people .\nIt \u2019 s very individual .\nConcern # 2 : Homeschooled Kids Don \u2019 t Have The Same Facilities Science labs .\nTheaters .\nSports equipment .\nPublic school advocates will name all of these \u2014 and more \u2014 that schooled kids have access to that kids at home don \u2019 t .\nThe problem is , it \u2019 s really not true .\nNot all public schooled kids have access to all of these things .\nIt vastly depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some have all of that and more .\nOthers don \u2019 t even have up-to-date textbooks .\nIt \u2019 s also not difficult for homeschooled students to do recreational sports teams , community theater , etc .\nTheir homes do not have to be equipped with everything they need when they have an entire community at their fingertips .\nIt can be .\nIf you feel the need to purchase full , out-of-the-box curricula for every subject of every year , or to choose a wide variety of online classes .\nBut also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs available .\nThere is the library .\nThere is the internet .\nMany places offer homeschool discounts ( including many museums ) .\nIt can be expensive , but it does not have to be .\nWho decided what the standards are , anyway ?\nWhy do all 7-year-olds need to read a certain list of words , learn their state \u2019 s history , and do fractions ?\nIt \u2019 s entirely arbitrary .\nIn truth , every child learns at a different pace .\nAnd every child has strengths and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily to them , and subjects or topics that don \u2019 t .\nExpecting all children to be at the same level across many subjects is absolutely ridiculous .\nHomeschoolers do not \u201c get behind \u201d because standards don \u2019 t matter .\nInstead , they accelerate in areas that are easy for them , and they take extra time to truly understand things that are more difficult for them .\nThey \u2019 re not judged with bad grades or being told they \u2019 re \u201c dumb \u201d by their classmates , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are frustrating for them because they are not being held to an impossible standard , and they are given the time and resources they need to be successful .\nThere is absolutely no benefit to pushing kids along through the public school system even when they do not fully understand what they are learning ( which happens too often ) .\nThat may look like \u201c rigor \u201d to some , but is actually utter foolishness .\nConcern # 5 : Parents Never Get a Break From Their Kids This is a concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions other than sending kids to public school .\nSome mothers choose to higher a mother \u2019 s helper for a few hours a week to give them a break .\nOthers trade kids with a friend , so each has some kid-free time ( this is also a socialization opportunity ! )\n.\nStill others may share the responsibility between parents , with each giving the other some time for themselves .\nIt \u2019 s also less of an issue as kids get older .\nThey are able to play more independently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be at youth group .\nAnd when they are around , the attention they need is not the same as the attention that toddlers and preschoolers need .\n( No one \u2019 s worried about a 10-year-old throwing themselves on the floor because you handed them the wrong color bowl , or the 12-year-old trying to climb the counter to get a knife . )\nNot all families feel this way , though .\nSome truly enjoy the closeness and time spent together .\nIt is very individual .\nSome people feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes at 8 AM sharp , transitioning when the bell rings every 45 minutes , and having defined schedules for everything .\nIf that \u2019 s how you prefer to work , then that \u2019 s great .\nBut there is truly no universal benefit to this .\nEveryone has a different work style .\nSome prefer to get started later in the day .\nThis is not \u201c lazy , \u201d it \u2019 s just different .\nSome prefer to work at a desk while neatly dressed .\nOthers prefer to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither is better than the other !\nBeyond that , homeschoolers do not need a full day to get their work done .\nThey are working independently or in small groups , so there is no need to build in time for busy work , transitions , study hall , etc .\nMuch of the public school day is designed so that one teacher can address 20 \u2013 30 different students , who may be in vastly different places in their understanding or needs ( and this takes time , which means other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the teacher helps individuals or small groups ) .\nThat isn \u2019 t true at home .\nHomeschoolers evolve their own structure \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 based on their personalities , needs , and preferences .\nAnd there are great advantages to getting to do what works for you , instead of having to fit into someone else \u2019 s structure !\nConcern # 7 : They Don \u2019 t Get to Go to Prom Or Experience Other \u201c Big Events \u201d It amuses me that this is a real concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the milestones and happy times in life are based on a public school education .\nObviously , kids who are homeschooled will develop different memories and milestones !\nMany do not feel that they are missing out , because they have their own lives and communities .\nBesides that , many homeschool communities actually do throw dances or graduation ceremonies now , so those who want to participate , can .\nHomeschooled kids will also have treasured experiences that public schooled kids don \u2019 t have\u2026but no one \u2019 s thinking about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ?\nLife is just different \u2014 not worse .\nConcern # 8 : But People Will Criticize You !\nThere will be someone who criticizes every parenting choice you make .\nWhether you choose home or hospital birth , breastfeeding or formula , co-sleeping or sleep training , gentle parenting or corporal punishment , etc .\netc .\nthere will be someone who has something to say about it .\nYou can \u2019 t please everyone .\nAnd neither should you try .\nShould we be making an educational choice that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on whether or not adults in our lives will like it ?\nAdults who may know nothing about it\u2026but still have an opinion ?\nI mean , I \u2019 m not .\nThose who are\u2026maybe their public education socialization skills are showing a bit .\n\ud83d\ude09 Do what \u2019 s best for your children , regardless of what anyone else thinks .\nWho Should You Take Advice From ?\nIf you are considering homeschooling , talk to actual homeschoolers , particularly families who have homeschooled for years .\nAsk them what their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were and are , what disadvantages they have found ( every family will have something a little bit different ) .\nThey are immersed in the world and can give you an accurate view of it .\nBetter yet , talk to several homeschooling families , including adults who were homeschooled themselves !\nThat will give you the best view of what homeschooling is really like and how homeschoolers turn out .\nDo not take advice from people who know little to nothing about homeschooling and have never practiced it .\nEveryone has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome , or knows \u201c that one family \u201d who is stereotypically awkward and weird .\nIt does not seem to bother these people that they actually are

vomiting .\nIt is classified as a mutagen , meaning it can change the DNA of a cell .\nIt is also classified as an endocrine disruptor .\nThat \u2019 s Not All\u2026What ELSE is In Your Pool ?\nLike I mentioned earlier , there are other concerns about pools .\nThat comes from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the disinfectant in the pool .\nThe resulting chemical is called a disinfection byproduct , or a DBP .\nThere have been over 600 DBPs identified in testing .\nWhile this may sound alarming , it does mean some of the power to reduce the danger is in our hands !\nThat is a good thing .\nIn several studies testing public pools around the world , the highest levels of disinfection byproducts resulted from urea entering the pool water .\nSome urea is in sweat , but the vast majority comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they estimate that up to 1 % of total pool volume may be urine !\nIf that wasn \u2019 t enough to gross you out , let \u2019 s talk about how it reacts to disinfectants .\nWhen urea ( a nitrogen-rich molecule ) reacts with chlorine , a DBP called trichloramine is created .\nRecognize the base of that word ?\nChloramine .\nTrichloramine also has that distinctive \u201c pool \u201d odor mentioned earlier .\nDBPs are classified as volatile chemicals .\nVolatile means it is easily evaporated in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in studies to be the most abundant volatile DBP .\nWhen inhaled , it has been linked to respiratory concerns such as ( source ) : Pool employees and professional swimmers with prolonged exposure rates have an increased risk of these concerns .\nNot just urea in the urine is a concern , but other substances in urine such as artificial sweeteners and even caffeine can end up in the pool water .\nSome sweeteners are not absorbed at all by the body so they are completely excreted in urine .\nWhile sweeteners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is still the possibility of swallowing them .\n( source ) The CDC estimates that for every 1,000 children visiting water parks , up to 22 pounds of feces may be in the water .\nFeces carry many possible bacterial , viral , parasitic , and other microbes that can cause disease and infections .\nA couple examples are E Coli and Cryptosporisium .\nAccording to surveys conducted , many swimmers continue to go to public pools despite having diarrhea .\nDiarrhea is a common symptom with many of these toxins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these toxins may also require increasing the amount of disinfectant to destroy the toxin .\nWith increasing skin cancer rates the past few decades , their recommendation for using sunscreen keeps increasing .\nMore people are wearing sunscreen , reapplying frequently when swimming in the water , and even using it daily for months !\nOne common ingredients in mainstream sunscreen is avobenzone .\nThis breaks down into multiple different chemicals during its reaction to the chlorine , ultraviolet radiation , and water .\nUp to 60 different DBPs have been recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction in chlorinated and brominated water .\nAnother common ingredient is octocrylene , which is often found in high concentrations ( 10 % or more ) of sunscreens .\nHere are some interesting studies on it : \u2022 None Impaired expression of genes related to metabolism and development in the brain linked to octocrylene : https : //pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24463256 A disturbing note , these reaction are happening right there on the skin !\nThe toxicity of many of these DBPs have not even been studied yet .\nThe few that have , have shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and absorbed through the skin .\nAs studies are continuing , hopefully we will learn more .\nSome show signs of being endocrine disruptors or mutagenic .\nEven before DBPs are created from the sunscreens , many of the ingredients have less-than-desirable effects on humans and animals .\nThese chemicals are mostly absorbed through the skin .\nFor example , Benzophenone is another common ingredient in sunscreen that has been proven to bioaccumulate in humans ( through urine testing in high concentration ) , and shows a strong link with women being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is linked to hormones and on the rise ) .\nLike avobenzone , benzophenone is an endocrine disruptor .\nPools are originally filled with tap water , which presents its own set of concerns .\nPesticides , herbicides , and other runoff chemicals add in another concern .\nChemicals like altrazine and alachlor have been found in groundwater .\nMany areas have begun testing for this .\nIf you do a search with your state and \u201c well water testing , \u201d then you should be able to learn more about your local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disinfectants ?\nMany are known to create DBPs .\nhttps : //www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/national-primary-drinking-water-regulations At times , these are even more dangerous than the original chemical !\nSome have been linked to epigenetic tumor promoters , neuropathy , endocrine disruption , and muscle contractions in the heart and uterus .\nA couple of decades ago , the studies were showing that pharmaceutical drugs were showing up in water treatment plants and other sources of water , like pools .\nDrugs are not fully metabolized by the body .\nThe remaining drugs are excreted through urine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system \u2013 or worse , right into the pool !\nIt can also be excreted through sweat .\nAll these sources continue to build contamination .\nUnfortunately , there has also been a huge increase in pharmaceutical drugs being prescribed since a couple of decades ago .\nIn swimming pools , some drugs will be reduced by chlorination and possibly become DBPs , like acetaminophen and naproxen .\nThere are other drugs that react very slowly to chlorine causing them to linger , such as ibuprofen , DEET , and caffeine .\nMultiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulated in pool water .\nNow the question begs , can other pool goers absorb them while swimming ?\nStudies show that there is a clear potential for inhalation , ingestion , and absorption .\nThere seems to be a lack of studies that look closely at heavily prescribed drug \u2019 s potential to affect other swimmers .\nOkay , so that \u2019 s a lot about the risks of swimming pools !\nDoes this mean you have to completely give up swimming this year \u2013 even on the hottest days of summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimize the risks and still get to enjoy the water !\nWays to minimize the effects of public pools Showering : Shower before entering a pool .\nThis does 2 things to protect you : \u2022 None Wet , hydrated skin and hair can decrease how much disinfectant is absorbed by your cells .\n\u2022 None Washes away debris and chemicals , reducing the chances of DBP occurring .\nPost-Swim Showering : Shower immediately after swimming to remove the disinfectant and any lingering DBPs as much as possible .\nExfoliate both to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these chemicals and to help get the lymphatic system moving to detox any already absorbed toxins .\nMoisturize : Replenish the good oils on your skin with a natural oil based moisturizer .\nAvoid Toxins : Avoid wearing toxic lotions , sunscreens , soaps , and other harsh chemicals when entering the pool .\nTry natural sun lotions that help protect and support the skin .\n( Learn more about toxins in personal care products , and how to replace them : Summer care products and general personal care items ) If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consider limiting exposure to chlorinated water .\n\u2022 None Do not pee or poo in the pool !\nAdults and children may need reminding , but this is very important .\n\u2022 None Do not drink the pool water .\nLotions and sprays are available on the market as well as homemade recipes that claim to protect the skin from chlorine while swimming .\nThese commonly use a form of vitamin C ( usually synthetic/isolated ) to neutralize the chlorine and a thicker oily ingredient to protect the skin from chlorine \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even utilize petroleum based ingredients for that !\nWhen petroleum meets chlorine , the DBP hydrochloric acid is formed .\nThis acid is corrosive to the eyes , skin , and mucous membranes \u2013 it is one of the acids stomachs use to break down food .\nInhaling this can cause respiratory tract irritation and inflammation .\nHomemade recipes vary , but let \u2019 s take a look at this common neutralizing spray : Vitamin C powder usually mentioned as the isolated and processed portions of whole vitamin C , called ascorbic acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hopefully , this water doesn \u2019 t have chlorine in it already , thus breaking down the ingredients before even hitting the pool .\nWhen ascorbic acid or sodium ascorbate meet chlorinated water , these break down with the chlorine to form hydrochloric acid and dehydroascorbic acid ( in much smaller amounts compared to the other chemicals ) .\nThere is not much information on how often one needs to reapply during swimming .\nThe lotion version usually suggests the same vitamin C components mixed with coconut oil .\nThis is to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a longer period .\nAt this time , the research to prove or disprove this is not available .\nWhile there are many topical products that claim to block the effects of chlorine , the research available shows that they either won \u2019 t work or could actually increase the risk posed by interacting with chlorine to form DBPs .\nI recommend skipping these .\nAs mentioned , Vitamin C has the antioxidant properties to neutralize chlorine .\nOne way to stay protected is to consume plenty of whole food vitamin C !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune system , prevent damage to cells , and support collagen production to keep the skin healthy .\nCamu camu fruit , acerola berries , and citrus fruits are great sources of whole vitamin C. Replenish your skin and hair with natural oils like mango butter , apricot oil , or jojoba oil after thoroughly showering .\nSupport your body \u2019 s natural detox process \u2013 the liver , kidneys , lymphatics , and digestive system .\nThis is an act you can benefit from all the time whether in the water or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vaccine Detox , Lymphatic Cream , and Gut Health Oil .\nHome pools have become even more popular the last couple of years .\nWhether you have a small kiddie pool or a larger pool , dealing with toxins is necessary .\nIf the small pools are cleaned and refilled often , a good water filtration system may be all the equipment you need .\nMatch that with teaching the little ones not to pee in there or put the pool water in their mouths and the risks should be low .\nSalt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pools .\nSalt water filters do create chlorine to disinfect the pool , but it is at a much lower level than regular chlorine pools .\nThat is because the chlorine is being slowly and continuously created .\nWhereas the other options are much higher amounts of chlorine at once with additional stabilizers to keep it regulated .\nWhen well maintained , salt water filter pools are more gentle on the skin and eyes .\nWith less chlorine , there are lower quantities of DBPs as well .\nAnd yet another positive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly who is swimming in it !\nExposure to fewer people means less chance of contaminants .\nIf you are filling your own pool with tap water , be sure to have a water filtration system .\nThis will reduce the amount of incoming toxins .\nIf a whole house isn \u2019 t an option at the moment , consider getting a filter for just the end of the hose .\nThis hose filter removes bacteria and chlorine .\nThese filters are made with the same types of materials as house filters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the other chemicals mentioned .\nThe level of filtration varies to allow for faster flow and more specific filtering .\nSwimming in nature \u2019 s pools has been a long tradition .\nWith the ever growing amount of toxins sprayed , flushed , and buried , it is hard to know what leaks into the groundwater .\nAs the water feeds the nearby lakes or rivers , toxins are being found all across the country .\nThe local extension offices or , in some areas , online county websites have test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to be aware of potential contamination .\nHowever , the ecosystems of the lakes and rivers may make it worth the swim if there is not major contamination or other hazards .\nThe sand , rocks , and plant life mixed with the flowing water helps to remove many toxins .\nIn short , like everything , there is danger ; but there are many ways we can reduce the risks .\nThere are options outside of public swimming pools that may be even safer .\nIf you do not swim often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned and avoiding overly strong smelling pools is probably alright .\nOpening the conversations while helping look for healthier solutions is always a move in a better direction .\nDo you have concerns about swimming in pools ?", "author": "admin", "url":

start around 10 or 11 , with menstruation starting around 12 to 13 , which is still early based on recent history .\nThe average age for the start of menses in a healthy young girl 100 years ago was around 15 .\nWhat \u2019 s causing our kids to start puberty earlier and should we be concerned ?\nWith early puberty comes the potential for mental health problems , like higher anxiety levels , lower self-esteem and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who did not go through early puberty .\nThere is also a risk for stunted growth .\nOver the last 60 years , we have seen an increase in the use of plastics , chemicals , factory farming ( think massive milk production with added hormones/antibiotics and soy-based foods and formulas ) and a decrease in nutritious food .\nOur kids are being hit from all angles early on .\nWhile it might be easy to feel overwhelmed with this information , there are simple and easy ways to help our kids .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ None Use as little plastic as possible Plastics have all sorts of chemicals in them , including phthalates .\nPhthalates are known to cause all sorts of problems ( breast/thyroid cancer , premature birth , low sperm count , hormone dysregulation ) .\nUsing as little plastic as possible might sound overwhelming , it can be broken down into manageable steps to maximize your effects .\n\u2022 None Don \u2019 t heat up food or drinks in plastic .\nHeat increases plastic \u2019 s ability to spread its hormone disruptors into our food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass , cast iron , or stainless steel will prevent that from happening .\n\u2022 None Avoiding steam-in-bag options at the grocery store or self-serve plastic cups ( think single serving cups like easy Mac ) is a great first step !\n\u2022 None Store as much food in glass or metal as possible .\n\u2022 None If you have a green thumb , try growing some of your fruit and veggies .\nIf you don \u2019 t , visit your local farmers market and see what they have available ( rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store ) .\n\u2022 None Convert your personal care lines to plastic free .\nBars of soap , toothpaste/powder , make up and can all be found in plastic-free options .\noffers an array of all natural personal and home care items .\n\u2022 None Shop the bulk aisles at your local coop and bring your own plastic-free containers ( mason jars and mesh bags are great ! )\n\u2022 None Plant your own garden from seeds ( lots of plant nurseries use plastic containers to grow their plants ) \u2022 None Can/preserve/freeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic-free containers .\nNow that we \u2019 ve tackled plastics , let \u2019 s take on chemicals ( specifically , harmful chemicals ) .\nHere are some simple steps to cutting down on chemical exposure .\n\u2022 None Keep clothing fire retardant free .\nIn an effort to keep our kids safe , they \u2019 ve been exposed to chemicals in their clothes , especially their pajamas .\nSo look for clothes made from natural fibers , and not treated with fire retardants , which are endocrine disruptors .\n\u2022 None Read those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnything that you can \u2019 t clearly read or understand you should think twice about buying .\nShopping the out perimeter of the grocery store will help keep you in line with fruits , veggies , and proteins .\n\u2022 None All-natural pest repellent for your yard and those \u2022 None Kick artificial fragrances to the curb ( perfume , candles , scented soaps and laundry detergents ) use fragrance free or natural fragrances \u2022 None Watch out for canned items from the store .\nWhile most are , we don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using now is safe ( BPS , a common replacement for BPA , isn \u2019 t better ) What if your little is showing signs of early puberty ?\nOr maybe you just want to be proactive and help make sure your kids are on a healthy path .\nIf adults can have out of balance hormones then why can \u2019 t kids ?\nIf there are things we can do to help adults , then there have to be things that we can do to help kids too , right ?\nAbsolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be done to support and promote hormonal health in kids .\nOur livers do so much for us .\nNot only do they filter out the bad gunky stuff like chemicals , it filters out hormones that are no longer needed .\nIf our liver is working over time , it won \u2019 t be able to do its best job .\nWhile reducing exposure to plastics and chemicals will help , using nutritional support like dandelions , nettles , and beets are other ways to help a liver out .\nSoluble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a vessel to help carry garbage out of the liver and out of the body .\nFoods like hummus and falafel can make it easy to get a serving of beans in .\nThe standard American diet is lacking in nutrition .\nOur overly processed food is full of empty carbs .\nThis leads to kids that are fed , but show signs of being malnourished .\nThe best way to combat this problem is with real food !\nKids \u2019 taste buds are still developing as they grow , so offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great way to get them to expand their palate , ideally organic and unprocessed for optimized nutrition .\nVeggies can come in some fun colors ( purple carrots anyone ?\n!\n? )\nand there are some pretty silly looking fruits to try too ( ah-hem , I \u2019 m talking about you , dragon fruit ) .\nTrying new foods can be a game , seeing if you can eat each color from the rainbow .\nFor the super picky eaters , there are great ways to supplement their diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conventional dairy can really mess with our bodies .\nIt can be inflammatory and the added hormones and antibiotics aren \u2019 t doing us any favors , either .\nFor those whose bodies don \u2019 t show signs of dairy intolerance ( signs of intolerance can be something like tummy problems or skin issues like eczema or acne ) try organic , hormone/antibiotic free , raw or as unprocessed as possible , dairy .\nObesity is a major contributing factor to early puberty .\nSo on top of eating healthy , staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many organized sports options for kids these days .\nFrom baseball , basketball , to mountain biking or rock climbing , there \u2019 s an activity for everyone .\nMaybe organized activities aren \u2019 t your jam \u2013 there are always things like biking , walking , and old-fashioned playing at the park that can never go wrong .\nIt breaks my heart to talk about how stressed out our boys and girls have been the past two years , but it \u2019 s the truth .\nTeaching our kids early on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence will greatly help reduce their stress levels .\nThis leads to happier , more resilient kids .\nHappier kids reduce the work their little adrenals have to do , resulting in happier hormones .\nHappy kids are healthy kids .\nWhen Your Child Starts Puberty Too Soon What if your daughter has started developing breasts at an early age ?\nOr has body odor , pubic hair , or has started menstruating ?\nAny signs of early puberty and your daughter should have a visit with a doctor .\nConventional medical doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advancement of puberty without addressing the root cause .\nA holistic doctor , integrative medicine doctor , or functional medicine doctor will have a whole body approach to helping get your daughter back on track .\nThey should not only evaluate her hormonal symptoms , but will check out her thyroid , adrenals , and check for tumors .\nWe live in a world where we have to work harder to be healthy , but it \u2019 s worth it for ourselves , our kids , and our grandkids .\nWe have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s health into our own hands .\nDon \u2019 t listen to modern medicine when they say \u201c they can \u2019 t figure out \u201d early puberty .\nDon \u2019 t listen if they tell you to do nothing , there are so many simple things we can do to influence our kids \u2019 health for the better .\nStarting with natural health can be safe , effective , and easy .", "author": "admin", "url":

B6 \u2013 294 % , Biotin \u2013 1,000 % , and here \u2019 s the real kicker\u2014vitamin B12 came in at 10,417 % .\nWhat ?\n!\n10,000 % of the recommended daily value\u2026 .\nWHY ?\nBeing a water-soluble vitamin , high doses of B12 are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can cause nausea , diarrhea , and other uncomfortable symptoms .\nHigh doses of vitamins aren \u2019 t efficiently absorbed as the body can only use so much at once .\nIn fact , it \u2019 s reported that in a 500-mcg supplement , only 10 mcg of B12 is even actually absorbed ( source ) !\nYet supplements ( and fortified foods and drinks ) often contain huge unnecessary amounts of individual vitamins .\nWatch for that bright-yellow urine \u2013 that \u2019 s a sure sign you \u2019 re just excreting nutrients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we can \u2019 t use them all\u2026why take them all ?\nMy first pregnancy/birth was very mainstream .\nI \u2019 ll never forget the stack of prenatal vitamin samples my OB doctor gave to me during my first appointment .\nThey were giant horse pill sized vitamins in bright blue and bright pink .\nFor me , severe morning sickness kicked in fast .\nThose doc-provider prenatals didn \u2019 t help at all .\nThey made me so incredibly nauseated .\nAt some point , I really looked at the ingredient list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things .\nThat \u2019 s when I realized they contained : FD & C Blue 1 Lake , FD & C Red 40 Lake , FD & C Yellow 6 Lake , Gelatin , Maltodextrin , Mannitol , Titanium Dioxide , Soy Lecithin , and other STUFF that I couldn \u2019 t pronounce !\nBack then I didn \u2019 t know much about natural living , but I did know that food dyes often gave me headaches .\nI must have tried five or six different prenatals after that including gummies .\nThose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sugar .\nIf your kids take gummy vitamins , check them for sugar content !\nIt can be pretty high .\nIt took quite a bit of trial and error , but I finally found a whole-food prenatal that was more gentle on my stomach .\nI just recently welcomed my fourth baby , and wow\u2013 this pregnancy was different ( actually , the last three ) !\nThose stories could be an entire post in itself but the short story \u2013 I didn \u2019 t need any traditional mainstream prenatal supplements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the switch !\n( Check out this e-book ) .\nIf you \u2019 re trying to avoid food dyes , sugar , and additive ingredients \u2013 carefully look over those vitamin supplements before you buy .\nLearn more about why it \u2019 s smart to watch out for these ingredients in this post .\nWhen it comes to isolated nutrient compounds , like those in mainstream vitamin supplements , the process of isolating the vitamin compounds is literally how pharmaceutical drugs are made .\nIsolates come with risks in use , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects and toxic reactions ( source ) , even if they are naturally derived .\nA study determined high-dose supplements of vitamins A , E , D , C , and folic acid were not only ineffective for disease prevention , but some of them actually increased risks of serious disease ( source ) .\nCuriously , vitamin D supplementation is often pushed in the natural community yet we really should be asking more questions .\n( Learn more about vitamin D here ) .\nA main factor to consider is the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier , each vitamin and mineral has agonists/antagonists .\nThese duos and trios work together for proper absorption and enzyme activation .\nThis is called nutrient synergy .\n\u2022 Vitamin C and Iron : vitamin C helps the body absorb and properly utilize iron .\n\u2022 Vitamin D and Magnesium : vitamin D isn \u2019 t actually a \u201c vitamin.\n\u201d D is a hormone and your own body can make it via direct sunlight ( but also get it from food and supplementation ) .\nMagnesium is required to actually activate vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Vitamin K : vitamin D is required for calcium absorption while vitamin K is required to direct calcium to the bones .\nThese nutrient relationships are intricate .\nThere are mineral to mineral synergists , mineral to vitamin synergists , and vitamin to vitamin synergists .\nThere \u2019 s no way I could ever remember them all or know exactly how much of every nutrient to supplement to maintain the proper ratios .\nThat \u2019 s just me .\nAlthough , I did find a printable chart of key vitamin-mineral interactions here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I do know that every nutrient impacts other nutrients and either enables or blocks proper functions .\nFor instance , supplementing vitamin D needs to be done along with magnesium supplementation or a magnesium deficiency can set in ( source ) .\nSince I don \u2019 t use isolate supplements on a regular basis , I really don \u2019 t worry about this issue too much .\nThat \u2019 s not to say \u2013 you should never use isolate mega-dose supplements\u2026they are certainly useful in certain situations .\nThere are times and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s really going on ( like if a severe respiratory virus hits ) , then my kitchen cabinet stash is ready to go .\n\u2022 During severe illness : when severe illness hits a short-term high dose of specific nutrients can have beneficial effects .\nFor example , research shows Covid patients can benefit from supplementation with vitamin D and vitamin C ( source , source ) .\nVitamin C status and supplementation is also linked to pneumonia and sepsis ( source ) .\n\u2022 For treatment of chronic disease : research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IV ) vitamin C supports cancer treatment ( source , source ) .\nVitamin C in combination with other antioxidants has also been studied for treatment of chronic hepatitis ( source ) .\nThose are just a few examples .\n\u2022 For severe vitamin deficiencies : with testing and professional treatment , sometimes severe nutrient deficiencies are discovered .\nSevere vitamin C deficiency is called scurvy and requires special treatment .\nHypomagnesemia can lead to hypocalcemia ( low magnesium and low calcium levels ) which require more aggressive supplementation to correct .\nThiamine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion , ataxia ( nervous system degeneration ) , nystagmus ( uncontrolled , repetitive eye movements ) , diminished reflexes , seizures , and short-term memory loss among other issues that require high dose supplementation to correct ( source ) .\nSo , again there \u2019 s a time and place for mega-dosing isolated vitamins and minerals .\nBecause of the delicate balance and synergies of nutrients , I personally don \u2019 t feel comfortable using isolated ( and synthetic ) supplements for daily support .\nBut , that doesn \u2019 t mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI certainly do , and here \u2019 s why .\n5 Reasons to Use Nutritional Supplements for Daily Support As word got out about my sick kit supplement stash , I found myself sharing more and more with friends that I was focusing on food first .\nMore RDA value isn \u2019 t necessarily better .\nAnd with the risks of side effects and imbalances , synthetic isolate vitamin supplements really are not the right option for daily use .\nHowever , key nutritional supplements can boost your family \u2019 s overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might want nutritional supplementation for your family ( on a regular basis ) .\nIn this case , I don \u2019 t mean using single-vitamin or multivitamin complex supplementation all the time .\nReal food supplementation is the difference here .\nLet \u2019 s talk about five reasons you might want extra daily support ( or at least frequently throughout your week , as needed ) .\n\u2022 During mild illness and recuperation : for most respiratory viruses and common colds , that extra boost of vitamin C , magnesium , and quercetin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long way to fight off a nasty bug .\nYet , even in these instances , mega-doses really are not necessary .\nKey herbs and foods can make all the difference .\n( Read more of my late-night research collection on nutrients to use when illness strikes in this free Back to School Survival Guide . )\n\u2022 Concerns about Mineral Depletion in Soil & Water : conventional farming practices tend to contribute to poor soil quality which leads to lower nutrient quantity in produce products .\nAnd produce often travels far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt \u2019 s often picked weeks to months in advance of reaching stores .\nBut , eating farm-to-table isn \u2019 t always feasible .\n( Curious how nutrient synergy might impact your garden ?\nCheck out this Mulder \u2019 s Chart ) .\nWater quality also plays a factor in mineral content .\n( Speaking of water , if you \u2019 re wondering what to do about home water filtration check out the posts here and here . )\nHow can we possibly know just how much magnesium made it into those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can \u2019 t know !\nSo , adding supplemental fruits and veggies here and there may make sense for your family .\n\u2022 Life stages : certain times of life require extra nutrients .\nFor instance , during growth spurts kids may need extra magnesium for those achy growing pains .\nDuring pregnancy and breastfeeding , there \u2019 s no doubt that extra nutrients are required to support both mama and baby .\nHerbs and superfoods can help meet those needs for extra nutrients without the risks of mega-dosing .\nAs mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my stomach from severe nausea during my horrible enough bouts of morning sickness !\n( Learn more about nutrition while breastfeeding in this free guide . )\n\u2022 Activity levels : exercise is great for the body but so are the essential nutrients needed for proper energy production and recovery , especially after a muscle injury !\nVitamin C and zinc , for example , help the body heal and repair .\n\u2022 Filling the Gaps : let \u2019 s face it ; we don \u2019 t always eat a super varied diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dietary restrictions\u2026or maybe your child is going through a very picky eating stage , nutritional supplements can help fill those gaps .\nHealthy eating with nutrient dense foods is our foundation for daily nutritional and immune support .\nI want to be clear here \u2013 nutritional supplements are not a substitute for healthy eating\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b .\n( Check out this printable vitamins & minerals chart .\nIt features what the specific nutrients do and food-sources

our bodies have access to rich sources of vitamins and minerals in their natural ( bio-available ) forms that we can actually absorb !\nThis is especially important if any of your family members have MTHFR gene mutations ( learn more here ) .\nI keep a stash of key herbs like elderberry and mullein in case of cough or cold , ginger for digestive upset , and turmeric for inflammation .\nI also keep a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help cover any nutritional gaps .\nMy kids tend to eat their favorite foods in spurts ( and color themes come to think of it ) .\nOne week it \u2019 s green apples and green grapes , then next week they want carrots , mangoes , and papayas .\nAnd I can \u2019 t say they always eat super healthy or with a wide variety of foods ( especially when we travel ) .\nBerry blend powder , vitamin C food powder , greens powder , mushrooms , and even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , baked goods , soups , and other foods throughout our days .\nI feel better knowing we \u2019 re filling the gaps

Support Heart Health Naturally", "content": "Heart health is an important topic for me .\nAfter I had covid in September 2021 , my overall health declined .\nI had an auto-immune disease and was lucky to live through nearly a month of severe illness , followed by long-haul covid .\nMy long-haul covid symptoms included fatigue , irregular menstrual cycles , cognitive impairment , respiratory decline , and heart health deterioration .\nNot to mention , heart disease runs in my family , and I have a 79 % increased likelihood of hypertension , according to my genetic results .\nSo , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could control my heart health .\nPre-covid , I was pretty healthy despite a long list of illnesses I had overcome .\nMy lifestyle was filled with healthier choices influencing my health .\nI genuinely believe this affected my ability to survive covid and manage my dreadful symptoms at home , naturally .\nFor nearly a year after covid , my Apple Watch recorded my resting heart rate as low as 40 BPM with a heart variable in the teens .\nSo , I made some changes and will share them with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion times in the average lifetime and pushes millions of gallons of blood to every body part .\nAs the heart moves blood throughout the body , it carries oxygen , fuel , hormones , and other essential compounds for everyday living ( 1 ) .\nWhen the heart stops working correctly , we often hear the diagnosis of heart disease .\nHeart disease usually refers to several heart conditions associated with their own set of symptoms ( 2 ) .\nSometimes the blood supply that normally nourishes the heart with oxygen is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins to die ; this is called a heart attack ( 3 ) .\nThe most common cause of a heart attack is plaque buildup in the arteries , also known as atherosclerosis .\nAtherosclerosis prevents blood from reaching the heart muscle .\nHeart attacks can also be caused by blood clots or torn blood vessels and , less commonly , from a blood vessel spasm ( 4 ) .\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States , accounting for one death every 36 seconds ( 6 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart disease in the United States ( 7 ) .\n\u2022 Excessive use of alcohol or caffeine \u2022 Being African-American , Mexican-American , American Indian , Asian-American , or native Hawaiian\u2013partly due to familial lifestyles and cuisines .\nOne similarity between nearly all of these is the ability to prevent them .\nOf course , heart disease can be caused by genetic and lifestyle factors , but our genetics load the gun while our lifestyle choices pull the trigger .\nKnow Your Numbers , And Keep Them In Check Knowing your numbers means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood sugar , cholesterol , and triglyceride levels .\nThese are known as metabolic factors .\nStudies have observed metabolic factors of cardiovascular disease , including diabetes , hypertension , dyslipidemia ( low high\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol or high triglyceride levels ) , and hypercholesterolemia ( high total or low\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol ) ( 10 ) .\nHealthy numbers signify a healthy heart .\nYour blood pressure is recorded as two numbers-systolic blood pressure ( the first number ) and diastolic blood pressure ( the second number ) .\nSystolic blood pressure indicates how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artery walls when the heart beats .\nDiastolic blood pressure indicates how much pressure your blood exerts against your artery walls while the heart rests between beats .\nStandard blood pressure numbers of less than 120/80 mm Hg are considered within the normal range .\nIf your results fall into this category , stick with heart-healthy habits like following a balanced diet and regular exercise ( 11 ) .\nBlood sugar , or glucose , is the primary sugar found in the blood .\nThe body gets glucose from the food we eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source and provides nutrients to the body \u2019 s organs , muscles , and nervous system .\nThe absorption , storage , and production of glucose are regulated constantly by complex processes involving the small intestine , liver , and pancreas .\n80 to 99 milligrams of sugar per deciliter before and 80 to 140 mg/dl after a meal is typical ( 12 ) .\nCholesterol comes from two sources .\nYour liver makes all the cholesterol you need .\nThe remainder of the cholesterol in your body comes from food .\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dairy products contain dietary cholesterol .\nCholesterol circulates in the blood .\nAccording to the mainstream , as the amount of cholesterol in your blood increases , so does the risk to your health .\nHigh cholesterol contributes to a higher risk of cardiovascular events like heart disease and stroke .\nThe mainstream says there are two types of cholesterol ; LDL cholesterol , which is bad , and good , HDL .\nToo much of the bad kind , or not enough of the good kind , increases the risk of cholesterol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s inner walls responsible for feeding the heart and brain .\nThe average LDL level for an adult man or woman is less than 100mg/dL .\nThe average HDL level for an adult man is more than 40mg/dL and 50mg/dL for a woman ( 13 ) .\nOn the contrary , other experts find this controversial .\nOne review of 72 studies of nearly 600,000 people found no connection between total or saturated fat and heart disease .\nInstead , they discovered trans fats to be damaging while omega-3 fats were beneficial ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ve been told has been wrong all along .\nTriglycerides are not cholesterol but part of a lipoprotein panel ( the test that measures cholesterol levels ) .\nTriglycerides are a type of fat ( lipid ) found in your blood .\nWhen you eat , your body converts any calories it doesn \u2019 t need to use right away into triglycerides .\nThe triglycerides are stored in your fat cells .\nLater , hormones release triglycerides for energy between meals .\nA normal triglyceride level is below 150 mg/dL ( 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider when supporting heart health .\nOf course , not every option is possible for everyone , which is okay .\nUnderstanding moderation and taking steps to better your lifestyle choices is the best any of us can do .\nNone of us are perfect ; that \u2019 s what makes us human .\nHere is a starting point to supporting heart health naturally .\nThese are the things I \u2019 ve found beneficial in my heart health recovery , backed by science .\nChoosing real foods means choosing heart-healthy foods .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid health deterioration .\nAppropriate food choices are crucial steps in attaining optimal heart health .\nLet \u2019 s dig deeper into what I mean .\nWhole foods include natural foods that are not heavily processed .\nNatural food products are real , unrefined , or minimally refined ( i.e.\n, whole grains , fruits , vegetables , and legumes ) .\nFor some , this may include meat and dairy ; if that \u2019 s the case , stick to pasture-raised organic meats and raw dairy .\nI choose plant-based , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be good for your heart .\nThere are several types of plant-based lifestyles , but not all of them are healthy .\nTo learn the benefits of adopting a plant-based lifestyle , check out my article Why Adopt A Plant-Based Lifestyle , here .\nSome tips when choosing whole foods include : \u2022 Choose unprocessed , high-quality salt such as sea salt or pink salt .\nThere \u2019 s so much controversy over heart-healthy foods .\nOne source says to avoid eggs , while the next states to eat them frequently .\nSome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs are not as heart-healthy as we once thought .\nRecent studies have found eggs to increase the risk of coronary artery calcium scores , a measure of heart disease risk , an increased risk of obesity and diabetes , and hypertension ( 17,18 ) .\nSo why does the American Heart Association have nearly 40 recipes on their \u201c Healthy Recipe \u201d tab with egg ingredients ?\nMaybe it has something to do with Eggland \u2019 s Best being one of the American Heart Association \u2019 s proud national supporters , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pockets ( 19 ) .\nIf you \u2019 re looking for actual heart-healthy foods , aside from good old fruits and vegetables , try some of these options : Looking for healthful recipes ?\nYou can find plenty of recipes in Earthley \u2019 s free Nourished Living Cookbook .\nAlthough food is probably the most crucial step to optimal heart health , drink choices are presumably the second most influential .\nIt \u2019 s important to remember that everything we consume should be a way to nourish the body .\nEverything we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !\nSo what drink choices are best ?\nOur body comprises about 60 % water ; every cell and organ needs water to function correctly , especially the heart .\nThe heart is constantly working as it \u2019 s responsible for pumping about 2,000 gallons of blood daily ; water helps this essential organ function properly .\nOn average , a woman needs about 11 cups of water daily , and men need about 15.5 cups daily ( 20 ) .\nA cup of tea a day could help keep the doctor away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to research , drinking three or more cups of tea a week can lead to improved cardiovascular health and longer life .\nGreen tea is most beneficial due to its polyphenol power , as polyphenols are known to improve the function of the blood vessels , increase good cholesterol , and even reduce inflammation ( 21 ) .\nHigher consumption of coffee \u2013 caffeinated and decaf alike \u2013 was associated with a lower risk of total mortality , including deaths attributed to heart disease , nervous system diseases , and suicide ?\nBetter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee drinking has been linked to a lower risk of coronary heart disease in women ( 22 ) .\nRed wine , in moderation , has been thought of as heart-healthy .\nAlthough the link between red wine and fewer heart attacks isn \u2019 t completely understood , it may be because there are antioxidants in red wine .\nAntioxidants provide the benefit of increased levels of high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol , the \u201c good \u201d cholesterol , which protects against cholesterol build-up ( 23 ) .\nAlthough it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for heart benefits because too much can be detrimental to your health , it is excellent to know that if you enjoy a glass of red wine with your dinner , it appears to help your heart \u2019 s health .\nA safe rule of measure for alcohol consumption is up to ONE drink per day for women and TWO drinks for men .\nMost adults need 7 hours of sleep each night , but most report not getting that !\nBetter yet , did you know those who get less than 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to have health problems like heart attack , asthma , and depression ?\nActually , insomnia is linked to high blood pressure and heart disease ( 24 ) .\nSleep doesn \u2019 t come easy for some people .\nI \u2019 ve found this is most common in people who are deficient in magnesium .\nMagnesium performs over 300 essential functions in the body !\nMost people are low , leading to many common health issues like sleepless nights , headaches , restless legs , constipation , anxiety , depression , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the symptoms with OTC meds with nasty side effects .\nInstead , address the root issue and care for your body naturally with something like Earthley \u2019 s Sleepy Time or Good Night Lotion .\nMost people don \u2019 t know this and are quick to grab melatonin , which may be natural to our body , but the pills found in the stores are synthetic and loaded with fillers .\nMelatonin is a hormone that our bodies naturally produce .\nIf you genuinely need additional melatonin , try finding it in natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall asleep and stay asleep , I highly recommend Earthley \u2019 s The Secret to a Good Night \u2019 s Sleep guide .\nKeep it moving to keep your heart rate going .\nExercise comes in many forms ; even doing simple household chores can set the mark for exercising .\nBut remember , the benefits of physical activity depend on the intensity , duration , and frequency of the physical activity .\nYou absolutely can not exercise once a week and expect to see a difference .\nSome of my exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have many benefits for heart health .\nWhy is that ?\nYoga is a stress outlet and a way to exercise and boost heart health .\nIt \u2019 s said that practicing yoga may help lower blood pressure , blood cholesterol , and blood glucose levels .\nYou can find my top ten favorite yoga poses here .\nThere are a few reasons why you should take the stairs when you have the option to .\nFor instance : \u2022 Stair climbing burns more calories than jogging does .\n\u2022 Stair climbing reduces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one study .\n\u2022 Stair climbing improves cardiovascular fitness and can help prevent cardiovascular disease .\nAn Australian study of 48,000 people found that moderate-intensity dancing is linked to a lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease .\nIn this study , dancers were found to have a 46 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease than those who rarely ever danced ( 29 ) .\nA study done in 2013 found that people who achieve total physical activity levels several times higher than the current recommended minimum level significantly reduce the risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart disease and stroke ( 30 ) .\nPhysical activity was defined in this study as beneficial to heart health were : So next time you \u2019 re doing some household chores , step up your game , put some music on to dance and get the full health-hearty effect of cleaning , plus a clean home .\nAccording to Oxford Languages , self-care is taking measures to maintain or improve one \u2019 s health , well-being , and happiness .\nSelf-care is critical during periods of stress .\nPeriods of stress may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some heart-healthy forms of self-care you can practice include : Meditation activates your body \u2019 s \u201c rest-and-digest \u201d functions , which counteracts its \u201c fight-or-flight \u201d responses .\nDaily mindful meditation has been linked to lowering heart rate and blood pressure , which may reduce your risk of heart disease ( 31 ) .\nTo learn how to meditate , click here .\nBrushing your teeth twice a day for at least two minutes may lower your risk of cardiovascular disease .\nIn a study conducted where researchers asked 682 people about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who brushed their teeth less than twice a day for less than two minutes had an increased risk of having or dying from a heart attack or heart failure , or stroke by three-fold .\nResearchers believe that moisturized skin might prevent age-related ailments , including heart disease .\nA study of 33 older adults ( 58-95 years old ) had participants moisturize their bodies twice a day .\nAfter one month , they measured their blood levels of 3 cytokines ; they found that those who used the lotion had levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 33 ) .\nIf that \u2019 s the case , imagine what can happen if you adopt an entire skin-care routine !\nLaughter triggers a chemical response in the brain that leads to pleasure and a sense of well-being ; this allows the arteries to respond healthily , improving blood flow and long-term health .\nAt the University of Texas , researchers asked 17 healthy adults to watch a humorous 30-minute video of their choice .\nThey did before and after tests of blood flow .\nThey found the most significant difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately and remained steady for almost 24 hours ( 34 ) .\nIn other words , the saying is true ; laughter is the best medicine .\nPharmaceuticals are often handed out like candy .\nEvery year in the U.S. , more than 4 billion prescriptions are administered .\nThe number of retail drugs filled every year is expected to increase by 2024 substantially .\nData indicates that the average person takes four prescription medications .\nMore than 131 million Americans take at least one prescription medication .\nIn 2015 , the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s supply of opioids .\nIn 2019 , The United States

myocarditis , pericarditis , and other heart conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5,000 years ( 36 ) , so why wouldn \u2019 t we trust herbal supplementation to support heart health ?\nI recommend the following herbs : Hawthorn berries are tiny fruits that grow on trees and shrubs of the Crataegus genus .\nHawthorn berries are rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties .\nTraditional Chinese Medicine has used hawthorn berries as an herbal remedy for digestive problems , heart failure , and high blood pressure .\nSeveral animal studies have shown that hawthorn berries can act as vasodilators , relaxing and constricting blood vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn a 16-week human study , 79 people with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure took 1,200 mg of hawthorn extract daily , resulting in significant improvements in their blood pressure compared to those in the placebo group ( 38 ) .\nLearn more about hawthorn berries here .\nTurmeric , a relative of ginger , has compounds called curcuminoids ( curcumin is the main active ingredient in turmeric ) and is known for its medicinal properties that have been used in India for thousands of years ( 39 ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Along with its ability to reduce inflammation ( 40 ) , it is also helpful in lowering blood pressure by improving the health of the vascular system in the body ( 41 ) .\nLearn more about turmeric here .\nAmla berry or Indian Gooseberry has several culinary and herbal medicine uses .\nAmla \u2019 s antioxidant properties may protect against oxidative damage from heart injury ( 42 ) .\nThe

m pretty sure I \u2019 ve been lactating for the past six years straight .\nThere was a long break prior to that , so it \u2019 s really been the better part of the past ten years .\nWith my first born , we had an oversupply issue .\nTogether , my baby and I donated more than 800 ounces of milk to our local milk bank for preemie babies .\nThat was amazing !\nOversupply issues , however , caused other challenges like clogs , blebs , and foremilk/hindmilk imbalance .\nSo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t use a pump at all .\nWe established a solid milk supply that was just enough for him .\nWhen our third baby arrived , I was a bit more concerned about milk supply .\nThat \u2019 s when I started looking more into nutritional and galactagogues for milk supply .\n( I \u2019 ll share later what I ended up using ) .\nWe have our fourth baby now and it \u2019 s no secret that I \u2019 m getting older , so by now my milk makers are a bit\u2026tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we \u2019 ve really been concerned about milk supply .\nMainly because this baby arrived in the midst of all these global supply chain disruptions .\nThen add in the baby formula shortage \u2013 you can bet that keeping up my milk supply is at the forefront of my mind .\nOver the years , several of my friends have stated they wanted to breastfeed their babies longer but their supply dried up .\nMany factors play a role in building and maintaining milk supply , so in this post we \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galactagogues !\nAs a new mama , I remember being told that what I ate didn \u2019 t really matter .\nBaby would get everything needed from my milk and my food intake wouldn \u2019 t significantly change the milk composition at all .\nWell , that \u2019 s not the whole story .\nMama \u2019 s nutrition is so important ( for both mom and baby ) that we put together an entire 80-source guide packed with information on the subject !\nYou can download the Breastfeeding Nutrition guide for free here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy milk supply ( and keep up physical strength during postpartum ) the breastfeeding mama \u2019 s diet should include : Have you heard this \u201c galactagogues \u201d term before , but still not quite sure what it means ?\n\u201c Galacto \u201d comes from the Greek word for milk .\nGalactagogues are the foods and herbs said to help boost milk supply ( source ) .\nMany of these milk-boosting foods and herbs also provide your body with key nutrients .\nThey are a win-win for both mom and baby .\nDo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply or are they just old wives \u2019 tales ?\nThe anecdotal and ancient cultural wisdom suggests that they certainly do work ( source ) .\nBut what about actual scientific evidence ?\nWell , the fact is there hasn \u2019 t been much research done on the subject .\nA 2020 clinical trial ( source ) examined pharmacological galactagogues and herbal galactagogues .\nThe study found low-certainty evidence in either direction that either group increased milk supply .\nThey did see some evidence that herbal options benefitted infant weight and maternal milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not definitive .\nDespite the lack of clinical evidence , many mothers agree they experience benefits from use of herbal supports ( source ) .\nWhich Herbs and Foods are Considered Galactagogues ?\nOk , so we know galactagogues are supposed to help boost milk supply , but which foods/herbs actually classify ?\nThe American Pregnancy Association recommends ( source ) the following herbal galactagogues : \u2022 Fenugreek ( this one has become controversial , more on that later ) There are many other galactagogues than those four !\nA 2015 review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual studies ) identified and searched for information on the following herbal milk boosters : And we haven \u2019 t even talked about superfoods .\nOats are considered a powerhouse galactagogue which is why lactation cookies are so popular ( source ) .\nPersonally , I veer toward organic oats .\nConventionally grown oats are exposed to high amounts of the pesticide glyphosate ( source ) .\nMaking your own lactation cookies is much more affordable than the fancy packaged options , plus you can use organic ingredients .\nI found a recipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a milk-making boost !\nThese cookies not only contain oats , but also brewer \u2019 s yeast\u2014another galactagogue ( source ) .\nCheck out the lactation cookie recipe here .\nOther than a few store-bought lactation cookies here and there while nursing my first two children , I really didn \u2019 t consider using herbal galactagogues .\nI think I drank a tea blend once in awhile .\nWhen my third baby came along , I knew I needed extra support .\nAs mentioned earlier , the milk-makers were just tired by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fenugreek-free herbal tincture containing five milk-boosting herbs .\nBefore we discuss the five herbs , let me go back to the fenugreek controversy .\nFirst off , fenugreek has long been touted as an excellent galactagogue and it \u2019 s still the most popular herb purchased for milk-boosting ( source , source , source ) .\nMore and more lactation professionals , however , no longer recommend its use .\nFenugreek is a member of the legume family , so people with peanut or chickpea sensitivities may want to avoid this herb .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypoglycemic and hypothyroidal actions .\nIt could negatively affect women who have thyroid disease or diabetes .\nAnd , some women actually experience a dip in milk supply with fenugreek use , which could be due to its estrogenic properties ( source ) .\nAs with any herb or food , not every beneficial herb will necessarily be good for your individual body .\nYou have to consider food sensitivities and other factors .\nSince there are so many other options , I decided to skip fenugreek .\nIn my experience , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toughest .\nOn top of postpartum recovery , you have a tiny baby with a tiny tummy\u2014that means you need lots of feeding sessions around the clock .\nHonestly , it \u2019 s exhausting .\nThat also seems to be the period when clogging issues are most likely to occur ( but , this salve is amazing for helping clear clogs ) .\nIf mama can power through those first couple of months , then you \u2019 re well on the way to establishing a strong breastmilk supply .\nThe herbal tincture I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fourth nurslings is called Mama \u2019 s Magic Milk Boost .\nPrior to trying this blend , I wanted to know why these herbs were selected , so I read up on the benefits .\nHere \u2019 s the rundown on the five herbs : fennel , blessed thistle , alfalfa , marshmallow root , and red raspberry leaf .\n\u2022 Fennel Seed is an excellent herb for digestive upset and to promote breast milk supply .\nThis study showed increased breast milk sufficiency in mothers who used fennel tea .\nPassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in infants .\nSome evidence has also shown increased milk volume and fat content in a test period studying mother \u2019 s consuming fennel ( source ) .\n\u2022 Blessed Thistle is also a popular herbal galactagogue ( source ) .\nIt \u2019 s thought to boost production levels by affecting prolactin levels ( the hormone which increases milk supply ) .\n\u2022 Alfalfa contains high vitamin and mineral content , so it \u2019 s especially beneficial for mamas trying to keep up their nutrient stores ( source ) .\nDid you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cows to keep up their milk production ( source ) ?\nThis cracks me up , because I do make jokes in the first few weeks that I feel I \u2019 m about to \u201c moo.\n\u201d \u2022 Marshmallow Root is a versatile herb beneficial to fight inflammation , respiratory distress , and to use topically for skin irritation .\nWhen used with other galactagogues , it \u2019 s thought to assist in the milk boosting process .\nMarshmallow Root is also highly beneficial to soothe the digestive tract , which is helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\n\u2022 Red Raspberry Leaf has long been hailed as a super herb for women for menstruation , fertility , pregnancy , and postpartum support ( source ) .\nRed Raspberry Leaf is packed with antioxidants , anti-inflammatory properties , and has the

"After 10 years of breastfeeding , I have gained quite a few experiences \u2013 most of them towards the end too !\nMy youngest ( a three and a half year old ) has almost weaned himself now .\nSeeing the end of nursing in sight , I have been reflecting on my breastfeeding journey a lot lately .\nMy oldest and my 3rd sons were so fast to latch on and had barely any troubles , but my 2nd and 4th sons had some struggles that taught me about patience and perseverance .\nOne had a lip tie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth movement .\nThe other , my youngest , took a few weeks to get his latch right .\nDuring that time , I had my first experience with mastitis .\nI thought I had the flu .\nI felt so sick , tired , and even the lightest touch hurt that breast .\nI started searching for natural remedies right away to avoid taking anything that could negatively affect my brand new tiny little baby .\nSigns of Mastitis and How it Affects Breastfeeding Recognizing mastitis is generally simple .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common that only one breast is sore , along with one or more of these symptoms : \u2022 None Swelling on the breast that feels hot , looks red , and hurts when touched .\n\u2022 None May feel a hard lump on the breast .\nIt is more than the pain during an improper latch .\nIf there is only soreness around the nipple then it may be from improper latch , like with a tongue tie .\nA cold compress and changing positions while working on getting a better latch will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is mastitis , then something more is happening .\nWhat is Happening when Mastitis Strikes ?\nWith mastitis , the cause of the inflammation is usually a clogged milk duct .\nSometimes , that can also develop into an infection which gives the flu-like symptoms .\nMastitis is most common while women are lactating , but anyone , whether breastfeeding or not , can actually have mastitis .\nOther causes of mastitis : \u2022 None Autoimmune or other conditions like diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis ( The causes of infection ( 3 ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is autoimmune mastitis autoimmune disease targeting mammary glands/ducts .\n4 There are different types of support to help mastitis , topically on the breast and internally for the whole body .\nIf an infection is present ( symptoms that are similar to the flu along with the breast pain ) , then the whole body support is a very helpful addition .\nMy favorite remedy for getting the clogged milk ( and lymphatic stagnation ) moving is the Milk Flowin \u2019 salve .\nIt helped reduce the pain and blockage quickly while helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hand at all times now .\nIt is made with : Castor Oil can be helpful for moving the clogged milk and reducing pain .\nCastor oil is antibacterial so it helps with infection as well .\n( 5 ) Try it

a waterproof bag .\nIf you are struggling with overproduction and engorgement , then the cabbage will be helpful .\nMassaging the breast \u2013 especially in a hot shower so the heat can help as well .\nFor nipple irritation from discharge or troubles latching , try this Breast Balm salve made with : It is very important to keep nursing .\nThe risk of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abrupt stop to breastfeeding .\n6 Some tips to help make nursing more comfortable ( along with the above suggestions ) : \u2022 \u2022 None To help remove the clogged milk , it is helpful to try new positions .\nOne very helpful position is Dangle Feeding .\nTo do dangle feeding : \u2022 None Lay your baby on a comfortable surface flat on their back \u2022 None Hover over your little one by getting on all fours or leaning .\n\u2022 None Offer your affected breast to your baby \u2013 trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where your clogged duct is so a stronger vacuum is pulling on it .\n\u2022 None Massage the breast while your baby is nursing right after the let down has evened out .\nStart where the lump or pain is and massage towards the nipple .\n\u2022 None Pump after nursing to help ensure the breast is emptied as well as it can be .\nMassaging again while pumping .\nMaking an herbal compress to use ( either warm , cold , or room temp ) can help as well .\nTry these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ginger , aloe , and turmeric .\n8 Increase your water intake if you are drinking less than the recommended amount .\nWhile water intake recommendations can depend on many health aspects , this is one way to determine how much to drink : Find half your weight and then drink that many ounces of water .\nFor example : 180 lb total weight \u2013 half the weight = 90 lbs so 90 ounces of water .\nVitamin D is a great immune system supporter and helps your little one too !\nBe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or use this Vitamin D Cream during massage .\nFeel Better Fast has a lot of herbs that are great for supporting your immune system during infection or illness : Adding garlic to your diet whether it is raw cloves , fermented cloves , or to the meals you \u2019 re cooking is another great remedy .\nAccording to this study , bacterial strains were most susceptible to the garlic extract .\n7 Turmeric along with its supporting companion Black Pepper are great inflammation and pain reducers .\n9 10 ( Try these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in improving the mastitis condition and reducing further occurrences of mastitis .\n11 Most of the time , mastitis can be cleared up at home using natural remedies such as a combination of the above

\u201d they tell me .\nThere is this mistaken idea that unschooling literally means unlearning\u2026that you try to avoid your children doing anything school-like or deliberate , ever .\nAnd that \u2019 s just not true .\nChild-led and delight-directed education are two terms that are often used interchangeably with unschooling .\nThey all mean the same thing \u2014 that the student in question decides what , when , and how s/he wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high school age , s/he is well aware that they are facing their future as an adult in a mere 4 years\u2026and that they need to start developing a plan .\nIn a healthy unschooling relationship , the parent is helping the student explore their interests and options , and helping them develop that plan for the future .\nWhat does this look like ?\n\u2022 Discussions about the future \u2014 their interests , their career goals , their future education ( will they go to college ? )\n\u2022 Exploration of jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or simply getting a job \u2022 Choosing classes or curriculum or experiences that helps them gain their desired/needed skills Basically , kids know they need to prepare for their future \u2014 and they do .\nIt \u2019 s not all about what they want in this moment ; they can and do think ahead and do what is good for them in the long run , not just what makes them happy today .\nWhat does this look like , practically speaking ?\nFuture goals are definitely a frequent conversation for me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she really needs to know for her future career , for being a generally successful adult , for getting her high school diploma ( which I issue ) .\nWhen I have said \u201c maybe you should learn\u2026 \u201d ( something typical kids learn ) , she often challenges me : \u201c When will I use that ?\nWhy do I need to know it ?\n\u201d If I can make a good case for it , then she \u2019 s up for learning it .\nEven if it \u2019 s not something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t enjoy math , but fully understands she \u2019 s going to need to know how to create and follow a budget , file taxes , and do other basic \u201c adulting \u201d math .\nShe \u2019 s not keen on 18th century British literature , and doesn \u2019 t see any need for it \u2014 so it \u2019 s a no from her .\nCurrently , what she \u2019 s planning to do to start off her high school learning : \u2022 Lots of reading and creative writing \u2014 she plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spends an hour or two a day writing \u2022 Russian \u2014 she wants to learn this foreign language \u2022 Biology \u2014 we \u2019 ll be doing

writing whatever she comes up with , and asking for my help in proofing her writing ( which we \u2019 ve already been doing ) .\nEvery time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I give her a few more notes on grammar , sentence structure , etc .\nBaking is something she \u2019 s loved for years , and for a long time she thought she \u2019 d own a bakery .\nThis year , she decided she \u2019 s not the biggest fan of people , and that running a business dealing with them all day wasn \u2019 t for her .\nShe still loves to bake , and it \u2019 s chemistry to understand how the ingredients work and be able to develop her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has recently intrigued her , and she \u2019 s wanting to incorporate it into her stories , so she wants to learn to speak/read it better .\nBiology , I honestly just find intriguing personally , so I purchased a curriculum for this , and we \u2019 ll be doing it as a family .\nI \u2019 m modifying the curriculum to combine lessons , add extra labs , and remove a

interested in in it ?\nMany times , kids don \u2019 t actually need these subjects .\nA lot of traditional high schoolers are forced to sit in a classroom and go through the motions , but they forget what they \u201c learned \u201d as soon as the test is over .\nWe just don \u2019 t waste our time on that stuff , unless they want to learn it ( and every child has something \u2018 advanced \u2019

the hair moisturized .\nThe type of oil used to condition your hair will depend on the other details as well .\nPorosity is about how much moisture the cuticle can obtain and keep locked in .\nIf hair is low porosity , then the outer shell \u2019 s scales are closed tightly , not letting moisture in or out easily .\nThat also means it does not absorb oils easily either so the natural oils build up on the scalp , causing irritation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making hair look greasy .\nThis needs weekly or biweekly clarifying washes .\nJust mix 1 cup of water , \u00bd cup of vinegar , and if wanted , a

weak .\nThis needs a gentle wash with lots of nourishing oils and humectants to lock in and continue to bring in more moisture to the hair strand .\nWant to learn how to tell exactly what type of porosity you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that and simple DIY recipes in the free Hair Care Guide !\nDensity is how many hair strands you have coming out of the scalp .\nIf you look at your part line , you can get a really good idea of the density .\nIf you see barely any scalp along the part line , then you have high density .\nIf you see the part line well and beyond the part line pretty well , then you have low density .\nHigher density tends to need more conditioning oils and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLow density can be helped by using lightweight leave-in conditioners and avoiding heavy oils and

butters .\nIf you have more coarse hair , then you may need more oils and butters to keep it tamed and nourished to soften it up .\nWhile coarse hair is certainly strong hair , that same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just as prone to breaking as fine hair .\nDetermining your hair \u2019 s protein needs is an accumulation of the above details and your hair \u2019 s strength .\nFine hair and high porosity hair are both more likely to have a protein deficiency because of the narrowness and weakened outer structure .\nHowever , any hair type can have a protein deficiency .\nWhile expensive keratin protein

adequately absorbed or not being retained .\nHigh porosity and coarse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but low porosity and fine hair can be as well .\nSometimes , hair is just over-washed and overexposed to the elements and needs some extra love with reduced washings .\nOther times , it needs some help getting the moisture and conditioning oils into the hair strands .\nLow porosity needs a bit of heat either from hot steam in the air or a low heat blow dryer kept away from the head to help open the scales of the hair strand .\nHigh porosity needs cold water to help close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or butters rubbed in so it can lock in that moisture better .\nToo much oil can weigh down curls , taking away both volume and structure of the curls .\nToo much oil on the scalp can also lead to a lot of frustration and itchiness on your scalp \u2013 not to mention yeast overgrowth !\nTo keep it controlled , use a gentle clarifying wash weekly ( like the vinegar/water/EO mix ) and if needed , spritz hair in between washings with witch hazel ( you can mix EOs with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it also benefits the hair and scalp ) .\nWitch hazel helps relieve itching and oil build up .\nIf you are struggling with an

create wide sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a nice Flaxseed Gel recipe is in the Hair Care Guide ) .\nJust put the gel and a bit of water in your hands while you scrunch the ends up to the scalp to encourage

especially if you avoid meat , dairy , and processed choices altogether ; this is what I choose to do .\nWhole food plant-based is similar to a plant-based lifestyle , excluding all animal products and dairy products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily processed .\nWhole food products are natural , unrefined , or minimally refined ( i.e.\n, whole grains , fruits , vegetables , and legumes ) .\nTypically , those who have adopted a whole food plant-based lifestyle avoid added sugars , white flour , and processed oil ( 3 ) .\nA whole food plant-based lifestyle is the healthiest but challenging to follow ,

plant-based and have been on this journey since the beginning of 2020 .\nI avoid soy and gluten due to allergies and sensitivities .\nI also avoid anything that comes from an animal , except honey .\nI eat relatively clean , almost always at home , and limited , if any , processed foods .\nI also am very cautious about the types of oils I consume .\nI prefer to know what I eat by making it myself .\nWhether you \u2019 re looking to be entirely plant-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the perfect guide to get you started .\nTo learn the benefits of adopting a plant-based lifestyle , check out my article Why Adopt A Plant-Based Lifestyle , here .\nI was taught a balanced diet through the food pyramid as a kid .\nBefore it was changed in 2005 , we were instructed to eat the following daily :

more flexible , adjustable , and accurate , making it easier to maintain a balanced diet without overeating .\nI like ChooseMyPlate \u2019 s alternative .\nThey recommend dividing a plate by 30 percent grains , 30 percent vegetables , 20 percent fruits , and 20 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dairy ( 11 ) .\nAdditionally , the new guidelines make it much easier to adopt a plant-based lifestyle .\nHowever , there are still crucial elements one must understand , such as amino acids , proteins , complete proteins , and fats .\nAmino acids are the structure of the protein macronutrient .\nYour body needs 20 amino acids to function correctly .\nNine of the 20 essential amino acids must be consumed through the food you eat ( 12 ) .\nThe nine essential amino acids are : Protein is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just building muscle mass .\nProtein is needed to structure , function , and regulate the body \u2019 s tissues and organs .\nProteins comprise hundreds or thousands of smaller units called amino

animals get it from ?\n\u2013 plants .\nA complete protein is a food that contains the nine essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce on its own .\nAll plant-based foods have protein , but most are not considered complete proteins ( 15 ) .\nThe most common plant-based complete protein is soybeans , usually tofu , tempeh , soy milk , etc .\nI do not recommend soy .\nI am allergic to soy , but allergy aside , although soybeans have some health benefits , we must remember that most non-organic soy products are brimming with GMOs .\nGMOs have less nutritional value and more toxic effects due to the chemicals involved in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soybeans contain compounds like phytate , which may interfere with the body \u2019 s ability to absorb vitamins and minerals crucial for vegan and plant-based dietary demands ( 17 ) .\nThese same anti-nutrient compounds may also cause digestive issues due to a reduction in the gut \u2019 s barrier functions , resulting in inflammation that causes these digestive problems ( 18 ) .\nLearn more regarding The Truth About Soy Products here .\nFats , in moderation , are an essential part of a healthy , balanced diet .\nFats are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body

vitamin A , vitamin D , and vitamin E. These vitamins are fat-soluble , meaning they can only be absorbed with the help of fats ( 19 ) .\nOf course , that means it \u2019 s crucial to choose healthy fats rich in omega-3s , such as : Deficiencies seem to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant-based , \u201d I am here to tell you that that doesn \u2019 t have to be a concern .\nIf you take the time to educate yourself on balancing your meals , you should only need to supplement one vitamin\u2013B12 .\nThe most common vitamin and mineral deficiencies include vitamin D , calcium , zinc , iron , iodine , and B12 ( 20 ) .\nThis section is dedicated to learning where to find these vitamins and minerals without fortified foods ( synthetic vitamins ) .\nMost people seem to grab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that approach is unhealthy and overplayed .\nLearn more regarding The Truth About Multivitamins here .\nIf you think you may have a deficiency , take this quiz here .\nVitamin D is a fat-soluble nutrient we eat and a hormone our bodies make .\nThis nutrient helps our body absorb and retain calcium and phosphorus , both vital for building bone .\nStudies have demonstrated vitamin D can diminish cancer cell growth , help battle infections and reduce inflammation ( 21 ) .\nVitamin D is usually found in animal products but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the richest plant-based sources of vitamin D besides fortified foods is mushrooms grown in sunlight , which contains about 450 IU per 100-gram serving ( 22 ) .\nAdditionally , sun exposure is the easiest way to get vitamin D ( 23 ) .\nYou may not need a daily vitamin D supplement if you incorporate mushrooms into your diet and spend time outside .\nThe best mushrooms for vitamin D are portobello , maitake , morel , button , and shiitake .\nI am not a huge fan of mushrooms ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too .\nStill , you can slice your store-bought mushrooms , place them on a tray , and leave them outside in the sun for a few hours to soak up vitamin D. Since I don \u2019 t eat mushrooms often , I supplement with MaryRuth \u2019 s Vegan Vitamin D3+K2 Liquid Spray .\nBefore my plant-based journey , I had great success with Earthley \u2019 s Vitamin D Cream and would recommend that for those who are not entirely plant-based .\nCalcium is essential for the function of many enzymes , blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhythm as well as the formation of bone and teeth ( 24 ) .\nYour heart , muscles , and nerves also need calcium to function properly .\nSome studies indicate that calcium and vitamin D may protect against cancer , diabetes , and high blood pressure ( 25 ) .\nWhen we hear calcium , we usually think of milk .\nAside from containing hormones and pus , consuming traditional dairy has been linked to risks , such as an increased risk of broken bones , diabetes , ovarian cancer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truth About Cow \u2019 s Milk here .\nSome plant-based sources of calcium include beans , almonds , seeds , ancient grains , seaweed ,

identified by feeling cold all the time , brittle nails , restless legs/muscle twitches , and hair thinning or loss .\nHigh iron sources are usually associated with meat and eggs , but where do you think they get it from ?\nPlant-based sources of iron include : I do not need an iron supplement with such a variety of iron-rich foods but would recommend Earthley \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iodine is a trace mineral naturally found in seawater and certain soils ( 28 ) .\nIodine is an essential mineral for the body .\nThe thyroid gland uses it to generate thyroid hormones responsible for many functions , including inducing body growth and development , including the brain , especially for the fetus during pregnancy ( 29 ) .\nThe richest sources of iodine are usually seafood , especially oysters .\nAs someone severely sensitive to seafood , triggering migraines , that \u2019 s never been an option for me .\nSeaweed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I \u2019 m not a fan of that either .\nIf you \u2019 re

recommend and personally take MaryRuth \u2019 s Nascent Iodine .\nVitamin B12 is essential to form red blood cells and DNA .\nVitamin B12 binds to the protein in the foods we consume and play a fundamental role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve cells ( 30 ) .\nUnfortunately , naturally occurring vitamin B12 is almost solely found in animal products , except for chlorella , spirulina , seaweed , cremini mushrooms , and fortified foods like nutritional yeast and milk .\nUnfortunately , the natural , unfortified options are not a reliable source of vitamin B12 .\nWith that said , plant-based individuals usually need to supplement this vitamin .\nI use MaryRuth \u2019 s Organic Methyl B12 Liquid Spray .\nMethylated cobalamin ( methylcobalamin ) is naturally occurring instead of synthetic and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I chose this form of vitamin B12 !\nNow that you know all the basics for going plant-based , it \u2019 s time to figure out meals and snacks that your kids ( and you ) will

Sleep Let \u2019 s start with the basics\u2013why is sleep important ?\nThe truth is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we sleep , but they have discovered that some of the most essential functions occur while we are asleep .\nFor instance , when the body rests , primary restorative processes happen in the body like muscle growth , tissue repair , protein synthesis , and growth hormone release , occur mainly , or in some cases only , during sleep ( 1 ) .\nSo how much sleep is considered optimal ?\nThe National Sleep Foundation recommends the following sleep duration guidelines ( 2 ) : So how do we make these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variables to getting adequate sleep , one significant way to promote quality sleep is nutrients !\nThere are five key nutrients that promote quality sleep ; let \u2019 s discuss them .\nMagnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and participates in over 300 different functions .\nIt \u2019 s an electrolyte ( a metal salt/ion ) that helps muscles work effectively , produces a calming effect , keeps bowels moving , regulates temperature , and more ( 3 ) .\nMany of us are deficient in magnesium .\nMany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficient .\nLow magnesium levels are why people often struggle to fall asleep and stay asleep , causing a night of restless sleep and frequent awakening .\nMagnesium supports deep restorative sleep by maintaining healthy levels of GABA .\nSome studies have shown that magnesium has a beneficial impact on sleep ( 4 ) .\nIt may also improve restless leg symptoms ( although iron was more effective ) ( 5 ) .\nAlthough the science is mixed on the benefits of magnesium for restless leg symptoms , many people claim that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s known for calming muscles .\nYou can always supplement magnesium , but not all supplements are created equally .\nWhen taken orally , magnesium can cause stomach upset and diarrhea , which most people ( myself included ) prefer to avoid !\nMy go-to way to get magnesium is Earthley \u2019 s Good Night Lotion .\nIron is also an essential mineral .\nIron helps transport oxygen throughout the body .\nIron is a crucial component of hemoglobin , the substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An iron deficiency can be identified by feeling cold , brittle nails , and hair thinning .\nAdults with low iron levels also have poorer sleep quality ( 8 ) .\nPoor sleep

blood levels reduce the time it takes to fall asleep ( sleep latency ) .\nReduced sleep latency results in increased sleep and improves sleep quality and efficiency .\nSince zinc is widely available

urinary tract infections ( rUTIs ) , like me .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; men only make up about 12 % of infections .\n( 1 ) A urinary tract infection ( UTI ) is when there is an infection in some part of the urinary system : kidneys , ureters , bladder and urethra .\nRarely but occasionally , it can get very serious , and turn into sepsis .\nIn the case of a UTI , it is called urosepsis .\n( 2 ) The definition of \u201c sepsis \u201d has undergone many changes , but was defined in 2016 as a \u201c life-threatening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to infection.\n\u201d Signs of a Lower UTI ( in the urethra and bladder ) considered an Uncomplicated UTI : \u2022 None Frequent urination or feel the need to urinate even if you don \u2019 t \u2022 None Pressure or cramping in the pelvic area or lower abdomen Signs of an Upper UTI ( infection has traveled up to the ureters and kidneys ) considered a Complicated UTI : \u2022 None Any of the above symptoms \u2022 None Encephalopathy with an abrupt change in mental status The most common cause of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is E Coli .\nAlthough there are other bacteria that can cause an infection as well , like proteus , klebsiella , and enterococcus .\n( 3 ) Since the allopathic method is to treat with antibiotics , there are some cases of infections being multi-drug-resistant .\nBacteria become drug resistant by learning to produce enzymes that deactivate antibiotics and making the target area smaller that the antibiotic would target .\n( 4 ) Bacteria enters the urinary tract during a bowel movement cleaning , sexual intimacy , or during other times where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes the bacteria stays lower in the urethra or bladder .\nHowever , sometimes it goes up into the upper urinary tract like the ureters or kidneys .\nThere is a microbiome or

diseases .\nYeast , in particular , Candida albicans , can also cause an infection in the lower urinary tract infection .\nThe symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an increased likelihood of the burning sensation during urination .\n( 6 ) Any time something enters the vaginal opening like during sexual activity , it is possible to bring in an impurity such as bacteria or other toxin that can then enter the urethra .\n( 7 ) It can also cause irritation or a disruption in the microbiome causing an infection by creating a spot for a \u201c bad \u201d bacteria to thrive .\n( 8 ) Even exposure to STDs can cause UTIs .\n( 9 ) If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soaps on his member without thoroughly washing himself first , that can disrupt the microbiome .\nIt is just like using douches and sprays , they can wreak havoc on the microbiome down there .\nSpermicides on contraceptives and , if sensitive to latex for example , this may cause irritation allowing for \u201c bad \u201d bacteria to thrive in .\n( 10 ) Problems with the structure or function of the bladder can also cause a UTI to develop .\nAn obstruction in the urethra or bladder that causes a place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as reduces the bladder \u2019 s ability to fully empty .\n( 11 ) Not emptying the bladder fully , leads to unhealthy pH levels , bacteria or other toxins building up .\nIf the nerve to the bladder does not send the signal

enough fluids .\nProper hydration is important !\nAll nutrients are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have adequate levels of all nutrients .\nHowever , some nutrients have a wider impact than others .\nVitamin D is a strong force in the immune system .\nWhen levels are low , our immune system is not as well regulated making it easier for bacteria , viruses , and other toxins to grow anywhere in the body .\nVitamin

plan and researching what I wanted precisely , I came upon the so-called \u201c normal \u201d routine newborn eye ointment .\nThis was mind-boggling to see such an old , 1800 \u2019 s rooted routine still being described to mother \u2019 s as necessary or normal today .\nAlthough many hospital births consider this \u201c routine \u201d erythromycin eye ointment vital , my child would not be any part of it .\nConsidering I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no STDs , I will decline this procedure .\nFYI , you have every right and choice to say \u201c NO.\n\u201d While I continued learning more about natural birth and practices , I questioned if this routine newborn procedure was needed .\nIt is not okay to make it mandatory if not every mother will test positive for infections .\nMaybe you \u2019 re a new mama to natural health or experienced , but are curious about this eye ointment called erythromycin and why it \u2019 s still being used today .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this eye ointment , benefits , risks , other options you have , and making your own informed decision .\nErythromycin eye ointment is commonly used in hospitals immediately following a baby \u2019 s birth to prevent infection of the eyes , such as neonatal conjunctivitis or called ophthalmia neonatorum .\nThis infection causes inflammation of the conjunctiva in the first four weeks of the infant \u2019 s life .\nIt was rooted in the late 1800s ; 10 % of babies born in European maternity hospitals then acquired this infection .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ were left permanently blinded .\n( 1 ) Doctors didn \u2019 t know how to prevent or help infants who caught this infection for some time .\nThen a physician named Albert Neisser came upon the discovery of a sexually transmitted disease called gonorrhea .\nIt is passed through the birth canal from mama to baby during vaginal delivery .\nA German physician named Carl Crede discovered a treatment using silver nitrate solution and required the use of this with every newborn in hospitals , even before seeing signs of infection .\nDown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing infants severe problems .\n( 2 ) Now it \u2019 s not used in the U.S. , and doctors only use the antibiotic erythromycin to prevent ophthalmia neonatorum .\nBut it is unnecessary for every infant , and not all mamas will have STDs !\nSadly , many states by law mandate this eye ointment to be given within 24 hours after birth to every infant despite the mother \u2019 s status .\nCountries such as Denmark , Sweden , and the United Kingdom , do not use an erythromycin eye ointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and begin antibiotics only if they contract neonatal conjunctivitis .\nWow , this is how it should be everywhere else , am I right !\n?\nErythromycin eye ointment can be super beneficial if necessary , but if not needed , you should have the choice to say no .\nHere are some reasons it may be beneficial : \u2022 None If screened and there is a false negative test \u2022 None If your partner has it and re-infects you after treatment ( it will protect your newborn from neonatal conjunctivitis ) \u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth and then can have this as an option Prenatal care is not always available , and in certain areas , STD testing and treatments are limited to mothers .\nIt \u2019 s not always an option for some women where infections are high .\nIn this case , this eye ointment is helpful for newborns to protect them from chlamydia and gonorrhea infections .\nAre you considering using this erythromycin routine eye ointment for your newborn ?\nI want to share the risks of the possible side effects of using erythromycin within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s life .\nOf course , you can always reconsider your decision and change your mind !\n\u2022 None Short-term blurred vision ( can interfere with the initial bond or golden hour between mother and baby ) Mothers do not have to use this ointment knowing they do not have a sexually transmitted disease or have been screened and tested for STDs during pregnancy .\nAlso , did you know that according to a study , erythromycin doesn \u2019 t always prevent neonatal conjunctivitis ?\nApplying the ointment does not 100 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n( 4 ) Trying to take this choice away from every mother is not okay !\nMany hospitals portray this eye ointment as \u201c vital or necessary \u201d for your child , but in reality , it is 100 % OK for you to question the risks and side effects and say \u201c no thanks.\n\u201d After researching how hospitals try to normalize the need for this erythromycin eye ointment , you may want to switch to a midwife and home birth completely .\nThere is also the option of having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically can \u2019 t have a home birth and want to ensure your birth plan is adequately performed , including not getting this eye ointment .\nIt is crucial to constantly educate yourself on the risks and benefits , so you feel fully prepared for such procedures .\nSomething I did that prepared me during my research was having a birth plan written out for myself and all of my nurses and doctors to see .\nMy doula suggested a template , which made me dig into the things I never even thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAlso , if you are a woman who doesn \u2019 t know if you have a positive STD test for chlamydia or gonorrhea during your routine testing in early prenatal care and are in a monogamous relationship , you can decline the ointment if you feel comfortable doing so .\nTypically this can be done by signing a waiver .\nDo your research .\nIt is vital for you and your baby .\nLearning all the normalized hospital

kids have candy on Halloween ?\nShould you celebrate Halloween ?\nShould you hide the family away for the day ?\nI \u2019 m not here to tell you what you and your family should or should not do .\nIn MAM fashion , we \u2019 re here to explore both sides of the discussion and let you decide what works best for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !\nA few of us decided to come together for this debate , we are sharing our thoughts , joys , fears , and best suggestions for the healthiest October 31st !\nMany people celebrate Halloween differently and for different reasons .\nMaybe you grew up in a family or community that went all out for Halloween .\nThe great memories of excitement and adventure lead you to want to give that experience to your family .\nEnjoying all the fun of picking out a costume or seeing your child \u2019 s creativity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together during the haunted houses to get your blood flowing .\nLaughing your way through pumpkin carving contests and bobbing for apples .\nGoing out for the fun ( and great exercise ) of running around trick-or-treating .\nKnocking on doors to meet new people and say hi to ones we know .\nThese all can create an amazing community feeling that can be so therapeutic in our often impersonal , out-of-touch world .\nFor many , this is what Halloween is about .\nLike all celebrated events , there is a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big \u201c free \u201d candy hauls .\nNot everyone will gorge on all the candy collected , of course .\nSome feel it is fine one night a year to do so , and then follow up with a healthy diet and detox to prevent the overwhelmed mind and body afterwards .\nI mean , have you researched what sugar does to your body ?\nSome may have a few pieces and forget about the rest .\nSome people love Halloween for its deep-rooted history .\nSome ( probably the majority ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have roots in earlier times and different religions .\nCelebrating Halloween doesn \u2019 t mean the same thing to everyone , just like every other holiday or special time .\nIf people are to disavow all things that may have a past association with paganism and later viewed as evil from another religion , will many things remain ?\nAre we forced to give up all traditions ?\nThis debate is not new , and it is not likely to go away .\nHistory is important , but the future is also .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy .\nThose that are opposed to celebrating Halloween typically cite health , safety , the origins of Halloween , or philosophical reasons .\nLet \u2019 s consider some of the concerns that these people might raise .\nSome people are struck with the paradox of spending 364 days explaining to their children the importance of limiting or completely eliminating sugar/high fructose corn syrup and 1 day going all over the neighborhood to see how much sugar they can hoard .\nWhy try to just be moderate and let kids collect candy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not supportive of a healthy lifestyle , why would someone make it a thing tied mentally to celebration ?\nThe whole concept of modern Halloween for children is rooted in getting a lot of candy \u2013 candy that the entire rest of the year many people would be furious if someone gave to their children ( without asking ) .\nCandy , that if asked for during the other 364 days of the year , would evoke a long explanation about how those ingredients really hurt our body .\nIt isn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially every type of candy that is handed out on neighborhood porches is full of sugar , dyes , and other ingredients that can be harmful .\nPerhaps it is even worse for children who aren \u2019 t used to a diet full of processed foods to suddenly have large amounts of sugar and other harmful ingredients introduced into their diet one night a year ( or even stretched out a little at a time for a week ) .\nThe body is always working towards homeostasis , so children that are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle more with handling the sugar .\nAlso , children with certain genetic dispositions may have extreme difficulty handling the sugar and/or detoxing out the unnatural ingredients .\nIf your diet is typically devoid of sugar , you may be unaware of your child \u2019 s response to these ingredients .\nClosely tied to the health concerns that some people have regarding Halloween are the safety concerns .\nTypically , people do not encourage taking food from strangers , but when trick-or-treating , that is essentially all you do all night .\nStrangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trust of your children .\nSituations and people that would typically frighten a child enough to make him or her run away are not only tolerated on Halloween , but celebrated .\nChildren see modeled in front of them for that day that scary things are good and that ignoring that gut feeling to run away and scream is also good .\nObviously , this is all done implicitly , but most of the time implicitness is a much more effective teacher than explicitness .\nThere are plenty of older children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have complete license to scare children on this night ( while wearing costumes that completely conceal their identity ) .\nMany of these people are emboldened further by alcohol consumption on that night .\nThe decorations , costumes , food , and other things about the night are meant to be scary , but children are encouraged to embrace and celebrate those feelings of fear .\nThe history of Halloween can also cause concern for some .\nThere are many different theories about which exact celebration Halloween evolved from .\nFor sure there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebration of saints .\nThere are also some theories that connect it with a celtic celebrations , and others that connect Halloween with Satanic rituals .\nRegardless of where exactly Halloween has its origins , it seems clear that Halloween came from some kind or kinds of celebration based on the connection between the living and the dead .\nModern Halloween in the United States has little to no celebration of life and seemingly a strong connection to the celebration of death .\nMany do not celebrate Halloween for philosophical reasons .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values and goals based on those values .\nMany families have values centered around kindness , being a light to others , truth , respect , and other like things .\nHalloween seems diametrically opposed to these values .\nHalloween celebrates darkness , scaring people , and making things typically viewed as negative positive .\nMany people would find television shows or movies with certain violent , scary , suspenseful , or dark elements inappropriate for children , particularly younger children .\nHowever , some of those same people would then go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact same elements on Halloween .\nFor example , you might never allow your 5 year old to watch a movie with someone getting axed in the head , but on Halloween maybe you would allow that 5 year old to wear a costume and do make up that makes it look like they have an ax stuck in their head .\nBeing opposed to Halloween normally can be summarized by viewing Halloween night as a perversion of goodness and beauty .\nWhat normally would be considered bad or tragic is viewed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grotesque or horrifying is considered creative and beautiful .\nTrick-or-treating becomes a completely immersive experience .\nEverything is decorated in this way .\nPeople are dressed in this way .\nFood is prepared in this way .\nOnce the scene is set , children become active participants in the night where bad is good and good is boring .\nShould you \u201c celebrate \u201d Halloween ?\nThe answer : Just Respect Each Other We live in an amazing amalgamation of cultures in the US .\nAnd while we debate a lot about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t \u201d be done , there is also a lot of understanding around different ways to do different things .\nIncluding Halloween .\nSome people think that because of Halloween \u2019 s roots , that if you celebrate Halloween , you \u2019 re celebrating a pagan holiday .\nSo they choose not to .\nThat \u2019 s ok !\nWe should support people \u2019 s rights to do what works for them !\nMost in the US don \u2019 t acknowledge or know about Halloween \u2019 s roots .\nThey view it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scare people , get in the community spirit , or for kids to just have fun .\nAnd that \u2019 s ok too !\nEither way you fall on the matter or whether you land smack dab in the middle , the important thing is to respect each other .\nThere are so many things in this world threatening our children and our health .\nThe last thing we need is more fighting and pointing fingers .\nWe are 3 people with all different views that came together to share our opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other at the end .\nTHAT is what life is all about !\nRespect each other \u2013 you can still have your own opinion !\nYou can disagree and still be kind to each other .\nJust because an argument has been given the social media spotlight special , doesn \u2019 t mean we need to be rude to others .\nWe don \u2019 t need to lose our civility over all disagreements .\nSave it for those really big debates \u2013 like putting toxins in our food and children !\nWhat can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AKA Team Moderation Moderation is a great option if you want to have the community fun of Halloween with the unsavory health effects .\nSome people like to do Switch

my favorite one is making lefse !\nLefse is an amazing tortilla-like creation of warm potato-y goodness .\nOfficially , this traditional potato flatbread was brought over from the Norwegian immigrants

that ricing !\n1.Pull the potatoes from the refrigerator and let them warm up a bit .\n2.Begin to mix in the butter , salt , and heavy cream to the potatoes while slowly adding the flour through the sifter .\nYou can use a mixer with a dough hook or by hand .\n3.Knead the mixture until everything is well mixed .\nThe dough should be like a pie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form without sticking to your hands too much and not crumble when pressed .\nIf sticky , add a little flour ; if crumbling , add a little butter .\n4.Put the dough into small balls ( just about golf ball size is nice ) to help keep a

!\nFlour your work area ( easiest on a pastry board with a pastry cloth ) .\nYou want enough flour so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not too much that your dough becomes flour balls .\nBegin to roll out your dough
