Hollywood Los Angeles , the city of Lost Angels , countless movies have been created about magical myths and Legends told from ancient times .\nMyths have fed the imaginations and souls of humans for thousands of years , and helps give us insight on what our TRUE history really might have looked like .\nSome of the most captivating stories speak of celestial Angels while others speak of those expelled from Heaven , known as \u201c Fallen Angels , \u201d or \u201c the Watchers.\n\u201d Some would say that it is the Fallen Ones , fallen Angels who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : When God created man , a jealous Angel orchestrated a great rebellion in Heaven .\nSome say his name was Lucifer , meaning : \u201c the morning star \u201d .\nA war had begun in Heaven , his army of Angels were defeated and forever banished from Paradise .\nThese are the Fallen , exiled from Heaven , they wander the Earth , banished until the rebel Angel abandons evil , or some would say love .\nThey lusted over human woman , mated with them and fathered abominations .\nHybrid children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at these Angels for corrupting the humans and so flooded the Earth , killing its inhabitants , including the Nephilim & the fallen .\nBut that \u2019 s just one version of the story .\nAnother version says that God sent these Angels to Earth to look after the Humans , hence the \u201c Watchers \u201d , but shortly after , they became corrupt in their ways .\nSome believe that a few of the Fallen might have survived , forcing them to hide underground .\nThe idea of fallen angels derived from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c sons of God \u201d mentioned in Genesis 6:1\u20134 are angels .\n1 When men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born to them , 2 the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair and took as wives any they chose .\n4 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days , and also after that , when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men , and they bore children to them\u2026 There are many different ancient texts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fallen Angels .\nNo other goes into great detail about Fallen Angels like the Book of Enoch .\nIt is an ancient religious text comprising of various tales by Enoch , the father of Methuselah and great-grandfather of Noah .\nPart of the Book of Enoch describes the fall of the Watchers , the angels who fathered the human hybrids called Nephilim .\nFrom the BOOK of ENOCH : \u201c And the angels , the children of the heaven , saw and lusted after them , and said to one another : \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from among the children of men and beget us children .\nThen swore they all together and bound themselves by mutual imprecations \u201d .\nAnd so , the angels plunged from the heavens to take wives of their own choosing , defying the Creator \u2019 s will .\nThey numbered 200 and were led by their leaders .\nThe fallen angels became identified with those led by Satan in rebellion against God later in Christianity .\nThe story goes on to say that ; when the Fallen began their corruption upon the Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both mortal men and women .\nThey taught the humans about astrology , made known to them the metals of the earth , the art of working them and how to make weapons of war .\nThey taught them the art of sorcery and enchantments , Magick .\nThey grew such a lust for Human woman , that they could not resist the temptation of mating with them .\n\u201c And all the others together with them took unto themselves wives , and each chose for himself one , and they began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defile themselves with them .\nThey committed fornication , and they were led astray , and became corrupt in all their ways .\nAnd they became pregnant , and they bore great giants , whose height was three thousand ells : Who consumed all the acquisitions of men.\n\u201d This results in the creation of the Nephilim ( Giants ) as described in Genesis .\n\u201c And when men could no longer sustain them , the giants turned against them and devoured mankind.\n\u201c The Angels intervening into the natural order of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Watchers \u2019 and all that had been corrupted were about to feel the wrath of God .\nThe Fallen Angels are also equated with demons .\nIn John Milton \u2019 s Paradise Lost , the rebel Angels are depicted as falling out of heaven and into hell .\nAs they fall , the angels become demons .\nAll Synoptic Gospels identify Satan as the leader of demons .\nMichael , Uriel , Raphael , and Gabriel , the Archangels , appeal to God for judgment of the inhabitants of the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sends the Archangels down to Earth to deal with the Nephilim and the Fallen Ones .\nUriel is sent to tell Noah of the coming cataclysm and what he needs to do .\nTell him that the whole earth will be destroyed , and a deluge is about to come upon the whole earth .\nInstruct him that he may escape and his seed may be preserved for all the generations of the world .\nGod sends a Great Flood to purge the world of these creatures ; their bodies are destroyed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth as demons .\nNeedless to say , that the global demise of the Fallen Angels took form of a great flood .\nPandemonium is the capital city of Hell where the devil resides in John Milton \u2019 s Paradise Lost .\nIn Dante \u2019 s Inferno , Hell is depicted as nine concentric circles of torment located within the Earth where Satan is held in bondage .\nIn the very centre of Hell , condemned for committing the ultimate sin against God , is the Devil , referred to as Dis ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Satan is a giant beast trapped waist-deep in the ice .\nHe has three faces , each a different color : one red ( the middle ) , one a pale yellow ( the right ) , and one black ( the left ) : Red for the Europeans ( from Japheth ) Yellow for the Asiatic ( from Shem ) Black for the African ( the race of Ham ) Some say that Satan \u2019 s three faces are thought to suggest his control over the three human races , others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning , the Devil is within , only if you let him in .\nHumoral theory or Humorism can also be correlated to the Devils 3 faces .\nIn brief , it was a system of health and medicine used to prevent DIS-ease , as presented in one of my videos called : Hippocrates : The \u201c Father of Medicine.\n\u201d The term Lucifer was often used by Christians to refer to Christ .\nFor example : in Revelation 22:16 where the resurrected and triumphant Christ refers to himself as the Morning Star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angel to testify unto you these things in the churches .\nI am the root and the offspring of David , and the bright and morning star .\nIt wasn \u2019 t until the year 1611 when the King James Version ( KJV ) of the Bible was published that the word Lucifer started to become synonymous with Satan .\nThe early part of the 4th-century In the West was shaped by Constantine the Great , who became the first Roman emperor to adopt Christianity .\nThe image of the fallen morning star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Satan by early Christian writers , as a result , Lucifer ( Helel ) became the template for the devil and Satan in Christianity .\nJesus said to them , \u201c I watched Satan fall from heaven like lightning.\n\u201c 41 \u201c \u2026Depart from me , you who are cursed , into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels !\n\u201d Lucifer is most recognized in association with the name for the devil , but some scholars reject the identification of Lucifer with Satan or the devil and consider it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a spiritual opposite to Christ , giving Humanity a balanced path .\nThe Christian version of the Fallen Angels is slightly similar to the Book of Enoch but present the story differently , especially with regards to the name of their leader .\nFrom : The Book of Enoch we have Shemyaza and Azazel , to Helel , Lucifer , Satan and the Devil in Christianity .\nSo why all the name changes ?\nEven the Babylonian king is described as a fallen \u201c morning star \u201d in Isaiah 14:1\u201317 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen angel by Origen .\nThis description was interpreted both as an angel and a human king .\nLuciferianism is a belief structure that is attributed to Lucifer .\nInspired by the teachings of Gnosticism , Lucifer is not associated to the devil , but looked at as a savior , a guardian , instructing spirit or even the true god as opposed to Jehovah .\nIn Anton LaVey \u2019 s The Satanic Bible , Lucifer is one of the four crown princes of hell , particularly that of the East , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is called the bringer of light , the morning star , intellectualism , and enlightenment .\nMany people claim that Freemasonry is associated with worshipping Lucifer .\nAllegedly , 33rd degree grand wizard Freemason Albert Pike had addressed that Lucifer was God , and was in opposition to the evil god .\nFreemasons say that when Albert Pike and other Masons spoke of Lucifer , they were referring to the Morning Star , the light bearer , the search for light .\nPike says in Morals and Dogma , \u201c Lucifer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it he who bears the Light \u201d \u2026 ?\nLucifer or Satan is considered an archangel in Christian tradition and by Satanists .\nNow looking into Archangels , we find out some interesting information .\nArchangel literally means \u2018 chief Angel \u2019 .\nThey are Angels of high rank and are found in many different religious texts .\nThe Book of Enoch , also mentions Metatron as an archangel , and he is called the \u201c highest of the angels \u201d .\nOccultists associate archangels in Kabbalah with various seasons , elements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some Kabbalah-based systems of ceremonial magic , all four of the main archangels ( Gabriel , Michael , Raphael and Uriel ) are invoked as guarding the four quarters , or directions , and their corresponding colors are associated with magical properties .\nThe original esoteric Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn , where Aleister Crowley was trained used a ceremonial magic ritual that invocated the words \u201c Before me Raphael ; Behind me Gabriel ; On my right-hand Michael ; On my left hand Auriel [ Uriel ] \u2026 \u201d In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of good and evil , is situated in the Garden of Eden together with the tree of life and Satan disguised as the serpent who temps Eve to eat the apple from the tree of knowledge .\nThe serpent , or snake , is one of the oldest mythological symbols in the world .\nSnakes have been associated with some of the oldest rituals known to mankind and represent dual expression of both good and evil .\nHistorically , serpents and snakes represent fertility or a creative life force .\nAs snakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rebirth , transformation , immortality , and healing .\nThe Ouroboros is a symbol of eternity and the cyclic nature of the cosmos .\nSerpents are represented as potent guardians of temples and other sacred spaces .\nIn the story of Buddha , the serpent king Mucalinda shields Buddha , who is sat beneath a tree in meditation from a storm that arises .\nSerpents are connected with venom and medicine because the snake \u2019 s venom has the power to either heal or kill .\nIt is very clear that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good or bad .\nIt can either destroy you or protect you .\nBecause of all the snakes incredible ability \u2019 s , they are considered one of the wisest animals and being close to the divine .\nThe Greek god of medicine and healing ( Asclepius ) , carried a staff with one serpent wrapped around it , which has become the symbol of modern medicine .\nHermes carried a staff with 2 snakes entwined ( paired opposites ) called the ( caduceus ) .\nRepresenting both negative and positive energy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sumerian deity , Ningizzida , is accompanied by two serpents ; it is the oldest known image of two snakes coiling around an axial rod , dating from before 2000 BCE .\nDragons are legendary creatures that appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide , usually described as having wings to fly and capable of breathing fire .\nThe Chinese dragon is the highest-ranking creature in the Chinese animal hierarchy .\nOccasionally , dragons and serpents are used interchangeably , having similar symbolic functions .\nThe root of the words ; Draco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean \u201c To Watch , \u2019 or , \u201c To Guard with a sharp eye.\n\u2019 The Dragons were guardians of temples and treasures , such as the Golden Fleece as well as the springs of life and immortality itself .\nDragons are regarded as \u2018 The Watchers \u2019 as represented in movies such as the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings .\nIn the Book of Revelation , chapter 12 speaks of Satan as a \u201c great red dragon \u201d and is defeated in the War in Heaven against Archangel Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there appeared another wonder in heaven ; and behold a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and seven crowns upon his heads .\n7 .\nAnd there was war in heaven : Michael and his angels fought against the dragon ; and the dragon fought and his angels , 8 .\nAnd prevailed not ; neither was their place found any more in heaven .\n9 .\nAnd the great dragon was cast out , that old serpent , called the Devil , and Satan , which deceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the earth , and his angels were cast out with him .\nThe ancient Sumerian / Mesopotamian goddess Inanna ( Babylonian Ishtar ) is associated with the planet Venus just like Lucifer .\nShe was originally worshiped in ancient Sumer , under the name \u201c Inanna \u201d , and was later worshipped by the Akkadians , Babylonians , and Assyrians under the name Ishtar .\nShe is associated with love , beauty , sex , war , justice and political power .\nInanna was known as the \u201c Queen of Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tammuz .\nTammuz appears as one of Satan \u2019 s demons in Book I of John Milton \u2019 s Paradise Lost , shown here in this engraving from 1866 by Gustave Dor\u00e9 .\nApparently , Tammuz is the son of Nimrod and Queen Semiramis .\nNimrod is both husband and son to Semiramis who is associated with the Whore of Babylon .\nNimrod is mentioned in the Book of Genesis and Books of Chronicles .\nThe son of Cush and therefore a great-grandson of Noah .\nBiblical traditions identify Nimrod as the ruler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Babel , which led to his reputation as a king who was rebellious against God , as mentioned in Genesis 11:1-9 .\nAphrodite is the Greek equivalent to Inanna / Ishtar .\nShe is a goddess associated with love , lust , beauty , pleasure , passion and procreation .\nVenus is the Roman equivalent to Inanna / Ishtar & Aphrodite .\nA goddess who encompassed love , beauty , desire , sex , fertility , prosperity , and victory .\nAtlas , Perseus , and Hercules , from Greek mythology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nephilim ( offspring from the inter-marriage of a God and an earthly woman . )\nIn ancient Sumerian & Mesopotamian text and sculptures , we have the story of the Anunnaki .\nThese ancient civilisations looked at these beings as the Watchers of Earth .\nThey have wings just as Angels do , with a human appearance and others bird like .\nThey are seen wearing a wristband that resembles a wrist watch , that some believe to be some kind of portal device .\nThey are also seen holding what appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a hand bag or a bucket on the other .\nThe great Sumerian ruler , Gilgamesh , in the Book of Enoch , often describes the Anunnaki in much the same way that Enoch describes the Watchers .\nWho are the real Fallen Ones ?\nIs it an army of Angels , or is it us , we the human race ?\nThere are many different versions to the story , but there can only be one truth .\nThe Myths of demons , dragons , floods , giants , or hybrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fallen Angels or Celestial Beings with wings to fly , are deeply embedded in cultures and religions all over the world .\nPerhaps some of these stories have clues to the real story , and can be found scattered across the world , found in different religions and texts , just like a giant jigsaw puzzle , waiting to be solved .\nPerhaps the stories of \u201c The Fallen Ones \u201d , whether it be the Angels , or Adam & Eve , symbolize the fall of Humanity and the quest to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historians still consider this time frame in human history as unproven and fictional , there are numerous ancient texts of the days , when \u201c gods walked among men , \u201d and when mythological creatures were not just a figment of imagination .\nToday , it seems that our remote history is either not allowed to surface , ether because it would change the world as we know it and annihilate the global power structure , or because that cycle of human history was never meant to be known .\n\u201c The greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world he didn \u2019 t exist \u201d \u201c The second greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he is the good guy \u201d", "author": "Gary Lite", "url": "https://369news.net/2022/01/23/lucifer-the-fallen-from-darkness-to-light/", "published": "Sun, 23 Jan 2022 15:03:25

"title": "Humanity\u2019s Transition through the Wheel of Time", "content": "Astrology and the Astrological ages is an ancient science , dating back thousands of years ago .\nIt appears in many cultures , but as with most ancient wisdom , much of it was lost or has been concealed from the public .\nThe True nature of our reality is one of the most guarded secrets .\nThe ruling elite have horded this knowledge all for themselves .\nSecret societies and those driven by greed and power , have used this form of ancient knowledge to their advantage in wars and global manipulation for a very long time now .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ many great minds throughout the ages have practiced astrology , and for good reason .\nIn Western astrology , we are transitioning from the Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius .\nEach Astrological Age lasts around 2,147 years and are represented by the 12 Zodiac signs of Astrology .\nThe completion of this celestial clock is said to be around 25,764 years .\nEach age corresponds to the average time it takes for the vernal equinox to move from one constellation of the zodiac into the next .\nAstrological ages proceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrograde \u201d in astronomy ) .\nTherefore , the Age of Aquarius follows the Age of Pisces .\nIn ancient Vedic astrology , called the Yuga Cycle , we are nearing the end of the Kali yuga Age .\nThe Kali Yuga age is represented by Kali , the Hindu goddess who is considered to be the goddess of death , time , and change .\nThe supreme of all powers .\nThe goddess destroys evil in order to protect the innocent .\nThe Holy Science book clarifies that a complete Yuga Cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprised of a descending cycle of 12,000 years , in which virtue gradually decreases and an ascending cycle of another 12,000 years , when virtue gradually increases .\nAfter we complete a 12,000-year descending cycle from Satya Yuga to Kali Yuga , the sequence reverses itself , and an ascending cycle of 12,000 years begins which goes from Kali Yuga to Satya Yuga .\nThe Holy Science states that , \u201c Each of these periods of 12,000 years brings a complete change , both externally in the material world , and internally in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is discrepancy among experts where exactly we are , but most seem to agree that we are in a very important transition period for humanity .\nThe 24,000-year duration of the complete Yuga Cycle closely approximates the Precession Year of 25,764 years , which is the time taken by the sun to \u2018 precess \u2019 , i.e .\nmove backwards , through the 12 Zodiac constellations .\nInterestingly , the Surya Siddhanta specifies a value of 54 arc seconds per year for precession , as against the current value of 50.29 arc seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( \u2018 Sun Treatise \u2019 ) is a Sanskrit treatise in Indian astronomy from the late 4th-century or early 5th-century CE .\nThis translates into a Precession Year or 1 Great Year of exactly 24,000 years !\nThis means that the current observed value of precession may simply be a temporary deviation from the mean .\nThe Vedic doctrine tells us what Western astrology philosophies do , and correlates with the cycles described by ancient Native American wisdom as well .\nThe ancient Greeks also appear to have believed in an ascending and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet Hesiod inserted that a fifth age called the \u2018 Age of Heroes \u2019 , or a new \u2018 Golden Age \u2019 between the Bronze Age and the Iron Age was going to take place .\nEvery End has a New Beginning Now let \u2019 s take a look at some very important clues to when this will all begin .\nThe Vedic doctrine tells us that at the end of the Kali Yuga cycle , there will be a time of Darkness , also described in The Mahabharata , a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral virtue is stripped from the Earth .\nWhen the \u201c World Soul \u201d is full of blackness and corruption , and only a small fraction of virtue remains .\nMen turn to wickedness ; disease , anger , anguish and fear of scarcity dominate .\nThese descriptions accurately reflect our modern society \u2019 s progression .\nAs we \u2019 ve moved through modern history , this past age is coming to an end , marked by a time when global tensions have never been so high .\nNow let \u2019 s take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about when this will all take place .\nSigns of the End of the Age 7 \u201c Teacher , \u201d they asked him , \u201c so when will these things happen ?\nAnd what will be the sign when these things are about to take place ?\n\u201d 8 Jesus said , \u201c Watch out that you are not deceived .\nFor many will come in my name , saying , \u2018 I am he , \u2019 and , \u2018 The time is near.\n\u2019 Don \u2019 t follow them .\n9 When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t be alarmed .\nIndeed , it is necessary that these things take place first , but the end won \u2019 t come right away.\n\u201d It is said not to take the bible literally or in Physical form and the same rule should apply to the Vedic Doctrine or any Doctrine .\nIf we all worry about chaos all the time , then we will just get more chaos .\nLook at this information like Neo and the Oracle in the movie the Matrix .\nThey are only telling us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us to realize that we are the Chosen Ones .\nIt is said in the bible and I agree that \u201c All Will BE Revealed \u201d and implies that the old ways of doing things , the old power structure of lies , corruption and evil will finally come to an end .\nA new direction in the age of Aquarius , the \u2018 Age of Heroes \u2019 and a new \u2018 Golden Age \u2019 .\nThis all seems to be part of the massive shift in collective consciousness that is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u201c Passover Meal \u201d which could very well indicate the passing on to the next cycle \u2013 The Age of Aquarius .\nPreparation for Passover and The Last Supper Here is where Jesus guides his disciples to the house of Aquarius , in Luke : 22:8-10 .\n8 Jesus said to Peter and John , \u201c Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.\n\u201d 9 \u201c Where do you want us to prepare it ?\n\u201d they asked him .\n10 \u2026 \u201c when you \u2019 ve entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jug will meet you .\nFollow him into the house he enters .\nThe man with the \u201c water jug \u201d represents the house of Aquarius .\n\u201c Passover \u201d could indicate the passing over to a new era .\nOne of the greatest artists who ever lived , Leonardo da Vinci unveiled a masterpiece with hidden messages in his painting \u201c The Last Supper.\n\u201d Taking a closer look at Da Vinci painting of \u201c The Last Supper \u201d , there are 12 disciples at the table who represent the 12 zodiac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the table , followed by Taurus , Gemini , Cancer , Leo , and then we have the only female in the Zodiac , which is Virgo ( Virgin ) and is portrayed by Mary Magdalene , the only female in the Last Supper .\nThe SON of God \u201c Jesus \u201d represents the SUN or Sol .\nThe cross of the zodiac reflects the sun as is passes through each house of the constellations over the course of a year .\nIt also reflects the 12 months of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equinoxes .\nThat is why Jesus is usually depicted with the cross and circle behind his head .\nThe Sun is in the middle for its life-giving quality , representing God \u2019 s son , the light of the world , the savior of all life on Earth .\nThe Sun , the most visible manifestation of illumination in our world .\nIt became the symbol of the Creator itself .\nThe Christ spirit within every human heart .\nThe fact that each living being contains within itself a center of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c SUN \u201d , a metaphor for the light within .\nGoing back to the \u201c Last supper \u201d painting , we have Libra , Scorpio , Sagittarius , Capricorn , Aquarius , and at the very end of the table is Pisces .\nSo here we have the 12 disciples representing the zodiac signs , including the son Jesus , which makes 13 .\nA number that was demonized as being unlucky or bad .\nSo much so , that they had it removed from elevator floors and of course the infamous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original yearly calendar had 13 months ; each month was 28 days long , with Easter , the day of ( The Resurrection ) the last day of the year , making 365 Days .\nThis calendar is very similar to the Mayan calendar and several ancient Sanskrit calendars .\nApril 1st was the original New Year \u2019 s Day .\nA big clue of this remains in the names of the following months : So , January makes the 11th month of the year , February makes the 12th , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of the New Year .\nThis is where April fools \u2019 day originates from .\nThe Gregorian calendar was made up to confuse us and keep us out of our natural cycles .\nThe original 13th month was named after the Sun \u2013 SOL .\nPisces is represented by 2 Fish .\nJesus is said to be \u201c the fisher of men \u201d , as referenced by : Matthew 4:19 .\n19 \u201c Follow me , \u201d Jesus told them , \u201c And I will make you fish for people.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon , \u201c Don \u2019 t be afraid .\nFrom now on you will fish for people [ catch people ; be fishers of men ] .\n\u201d 17 .\n\u201c But we only have five loaves and two fish here , \u201d they said to him .\nEvery age has a spiritual icon or deity that represents the beginning of a new age and Jesus represents the age of Pisces as the \u201c Fisher of Man.\n\u201d The Ichthus was a symbol for Jesus in early Christianity , better known today as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the exact shape of the human eye , similar to the eye of Horus .\nWe can also see that traditionally the Pope wears a Mitre on his head in the shape of a fish .\nPerhaps this tradition was passed down from the fertility Fish God Dagon from ancient Mesopotamia .\nSome of the ancient gods have long been symbolized by fish , such as the Hindu God Matsya , the fish avatar of the god Vishnu .\nbut why ?\nWhere did this tradition come from and why does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head ?\nGoing back to Da Vinci \u2019 s \u201c The Last Supper \u201d painting\u2026 Da Vinci places yet another very interesting clue in between Mary Magdalene and Jesus .\nHere you can see the V between them that represents the \u201c Virgo , \u201d and the chalice .\nTogether they form a Trinity , which is the human connection to GOD or the Holy Spirit .\nTraditionally , the trinity is Father , Son , and Holy Spirit .\nBut what happen to the woman ?\nHow can she not exist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is woman and man to create a child .\nIt is Man , Woman , Holy Spirit or GOD that is clearly evident in all Alchemical depictions .\nThe balance of the Male and Female .\nMany of the world \u2019 s most famous celebrities and legendary renowned figures have attended occult mystery schools , or secret societies , such as Leonardo da Vinci , Michelangelo , Mozart , Bach , Beethoven , John Dee , Isaac Newton , George Washington , and many more who were once Presidents of America and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world knew that these secret societies were teaching initiates how to use this hidden knowledge to their advantage , such as astral body travel , where they can see proof for themselves that the mind does indeed have an effect over the material world .\nEsoteric initiates have been writing about this for centuries .\nThese are not the kind of teachings that you can just do a search for on Google , it is something that only those with the eye \u2019 s to see and the ears to hear will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you come to this understanding , you will perceive the world in a whole new way .\nFor example : The electromagnetic spectrum includes all forms of light energy .\nOur human visual perception can not see certain spectrums of light , such as gamma rays , X-rays , ultraviolet infrared , radar and radio waves .\n\u201c The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena ; it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.\n\u201d \u201c When you want to find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of energy , frequency and vibration.\n\u201d Looking into esoteric art , we can clearly see evidence of Astrology and the Astrological ages encoded .\nThe phrase \u201c As above , so below \u201d indicates that the movements of these celestial bodies mirror what happens on Earth .\nCarl Jung explains in his book , \u201c Flying Saucers : A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies \u201d .\n\u201c As we know from Ancient Egyptian History , these events are symptoms of psychic changes that always appear at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of another .\nThey are , it seems , changes in the constellation of psychic dominance of the archetypes or gods , as they used to be called , which bring about or accompany long lasting transformations of the collective psyche .\nThis transformation started within the historical tradition and left traces behind it .\nFirst , in the transition from the age of Torus to that of Aries , and then from Aries to Pisces , whose beginning coincides with the rise of Christianity .\nWe are now nearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the spring point , enters Aquarius.\n\u201d Jung is telling us therefore that these changes arising in nature are due to certain gradual transformations of archetypes , and that these archetypes mean , that in nature this clock is active , and that this clock is continuously moving , passing from one cyclic division to another .\nScientific literature is clear on

Machine by Dr. Royal Raymond Rife", "content": "We all know that Cancer is the leading cause of death , with nearly 10 million deaths each year worldwide .\nThe general public is unaware of any cures for any type of cancer , but what if I told you that there is a way to cure cancer and it was discovered in 1938 by doctor and scientist of Dr. Royal Raymond Rife , it is reported that he had cured 16 cancer patients using the power of frequencies and resonance therapy .\nDr .\nRife started by creating the worlds most powerful microscope in the 1920 \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacteria more efficiently .\nHe then realized that he could use electromagnetic frequencies to destroy cancer cells .\nHe discovered that every cell and molecule vibrates at its own distinct frequency and by beaming plasma rays of the same frequency at those cells , you amplify the frequency and destroy them .\nThis happens because of something known as resonance .\nWhen two things of the same frequency come together , they amplify each others frequency .\nThis is how wine glasses are destroyed with human vocals like opera singer .\nWhen their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass , it makes the glass vibrate at a higher frequency , making it vibrate more intensely and causing it to shatter .\nResonance can basically amplify the vibration of anything and destroy it .\nFrom something as small as a wine glass to something as massive as a bridge .\nIn much the same way , Dr. Royal Rife created a device that can shatter cancer cells by matching the resonant frequency , by sending an impulse of electro magnetic waves at the same frequency as the cell .\nYou basically amplify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHis Rife machine invention destroyed 60 % of the cancer cells in his patients .\nSadly , some greedy people thought that this was bad for medical business and that this technology would prevent them from making a great deal of money from all the cancer patience in the world and so , that is when they decided to destroy Dr.\nRife \u2019 s career and put a stop to his breakthrough invention that could have cured millions of people .\nSome may regard this as just an amusing piece of fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to do some investigating on their own , they \u2019 ll see that several highly-respected doctors and medical authorities who worked with Dr .\nRife witnessed , corroborated , and confirmed his incredible findings , as well as some of the remarkable technical aspects of his creations .\nHowever , in the final analysis , the only real way to determine if such a revolutionary therapy exists is to experience it yourself .\nThankfully , there are good people in the world who still practise Dr.\nRife \u2019 s work and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use products that you can actually use in your own home .\nI \u2019 m referring to the engineers at the spooky 2 family .\nSpooky2 is the most Effective and Affordable Rife system available today .\nThey offer free software updates and the world \u2019 s
