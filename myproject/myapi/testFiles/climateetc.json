to limit global warming is tied directly to limiting the amount of CO emitted into the atmosphere .\nEmissions targets are a centerpiece of the UNFCCC Paris Agreement .\nThe goal of the emissions targets is to limit global warming to well below 2 , preferably 1.5 degrees Centigrade , compared to pre-industrial levels ( typically the baseline period 1851-1900 ) .\nFor reference , the climate has warmed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissions scenario ( SSP2-4.5 ) , the IPCC AR6 constrained global mean temperature projections indicate that there is a 50 % chance that the 1.5oC threshold would be crossed around 2030 and the 2oC threshold would be crossed around 2052 .\nThere is uncertainty in the year for which the thresholds would be crossed ( 2026-2042 for the 1.5oC threshold and 2038-2072 for the 2oC threshold ) , mostly owing to the range of climate sensitivity to CO among different models .\nThis post illustrates now natural climate variability could influence the global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hence influence the time of crossing the 1.5 and 2.0oC thresholds .\nSpecifically , alternative scenarios of volcanic eruptions , solar variability and internal climate variability are considered .\nThe risk from not realistically accounting for natural climate variability is that critical possible future climate outcomes are being discounted , potentially causing maladaptation .\nEach of the scenarios presented here is arguably more plausible than the high emissions scenarios RCP8.5/SSP4-8.5 LINK .\nFor additional reference , see also theis previous blog post .\nVariations in global mean surface temperature are linked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNot taking multi-decadal internal variability into account in predictions of future warming runs the risk of over-estimating the warming for the next two to three decades , when the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation is expected to shift into its cold phase .\nWhile climate models simulate the large-scale ocean circulations and internal climate variability , the magnitude in the multi-decadal band is too low in most models and the phasing of the variability is not synced with the actual , observed climate variations in long-term simulations .\nAveraging multiple simulations from climate models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving only the forced climate variability ( e.g .\nCO forcing ) .\nMaher et al .\n( 2020 ) used six single model initial condition large ensembles ( SMILEs ) for 21st century simulations found that on a 15-year time-scale , surface temperature trend projections are dominated by internal variability , with little influence of structural model differences or the emissions scenario .\nOn a 30-year time-scale , structural model differences and emissions scenario uncertainties play a larger role in controlling surface temperature trend projections .\nHowever , even for projections out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globe could still experience no warming due to internal variability even with continued CO forcing .\nSo , for the period between 2020 and 2050 , will natural internal variability contribute to warming or cooling , relative to the underlying warming trend from emissions ?\nMost analyses have identified the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation ( AMO ) as having the dominant multi-decadal imprint on global temperatures .\nIt has been estimated that there is a peak-to-trough impact of the AMO on global mean surface temperatures of 0.3 to 0.4oC The climate has been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 ; hence in 2021 it has been 26 years since the previous shift .\nAnalysis of historical and paleoclimatic records suggests that a shift to the cold phase of the AMO should occur within the next 12 years ( by 2032 ) , with a 50 % probability of the shift occurring in the next 5 years ( by 2026 ) .\nWhile we are currently in the warm phase of the AMO , we are past the peak of the warm phase .\nHence we consider the following three scenarios for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global mean surface temperature change averaged for the period 2021-2050 : \u2022 The None scenario ( 0oC ) assumes no net impact of multidecadal internal variability on the global mean surface temperature , which is implicit in constrained projections of the IPCC AR6 .\n\u2022 The Moderate scenario ( -0.2oC ) assumes a shift to the cool phase of the AMO in the 2030 \u2019 s with a moderate impact ; \u2022 The Strong scenario ( -0.3oC ) assumes a shift to the cool phase of the AMO in the 2020 \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Strong scenarios are contingent on the assumptions that the AMO is the primary driver of multi-decadal internal climate variability and that a shift to the cold phase of the AMO is expected in the next decade .\nOther facets of multi-decadal and decadal scale internal variability could come into play over the next three decades , but these scenarios illustrate the magnitude of plausible outcomes over the next three decades .\nWhile the scenarios presented here focus on cooling over the next three decades , it is noted that the same reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will contribute to warming during decades in the 2nd half of the 21stcentury .\nThe instrumental period covering the past 150 years has been relatively quiet with regards to volcanic eruptions , and thus it is tempting to ascribe potential volcanism a minor role in future climate projections .\nHowever over the past two millennia , there have been periods with considerably stronger volcanic activity .\nClusters of strong tropical eruptions have contributed to sustained cold periods such as the Little Ice Age .\nExplosive volcanoes are omitted from scenarios used for future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nDue to the direct radiative effect of volcanic aerosol particles that reach the stratosphere , large volcanic eruptions lead to an overall decrease of global mean surface temperature , which can extend to multi-decadal or even century timescales in the case of clusters of large volcanic eruptions .\n( see IPCC AR6 Cross-chapter Box 4.1 ) Explosive volcanic eruptions of the magnitude of the 1991 Pinatubo eruption or larger have occurred on average twice per century throughout the past 2500 years .\n( Sigl et al.\n, 2015 ) .\nAbout 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 times stronger than Pinatubo ) occurred during this period .\nThe largest of these are Samalas in 1257 and Tambora in 1815 , the latter resulting in \u201c the year without a summer \u201d with harvest failures across the Northern Hemisphere ( Raible et al.\n, 2016 ) .\nIt has been estimated that a Samalas-type eruption may occur 1-2 times per millennium on average .\nGiven the unpredictability of individual eruptions , the CMIP5/CMIP6 climate model simulations either specify future volcanic forcing as zero or a constant background value ( Eyring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the CMIP6 simulations has been estimated from the historical record 1850 .\nBackground estimates of volcanic cooling determined from climate models range from 0.1oC ( Bethke et al .\n2017 ) to 0.27oC ( Fyfe et al .\n2021 ) , the differences arising from model structural differences .\nThe IPCC AR6 states that it is likely that at least one large eruption will occur during the 21st century .\nThe AR6 further acknowledges that a low likelihood , high impact outcome of several large eruptions would greatly alter the 21st century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Cross Chapter Box 4.1 ) How much cooling could happen from explosive volcanic eruptions in the 21st century ?\nA cluster of explosive eruptions such as happened in the first half of the 19th century is estimated to have caused 0.5oC cooling averaged over several decades .\n( Figure 7.8 IPCC AR6 ) This analysis considers three scenarios of volcanic cooling for the 21st century : \u2022 Low Baseline scenario , equivalent to a weak response to the average volcanic forcing over the historical record since 1850 , estimated at -0.1oC ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the explosive eruptions that occurred during 1810-1840 , estimated to have caused a decadally-averaged cooling of -0.5oC A detailed analysis of the rationale for selecting scenarios of solar variations is described an a recent blog post LINK There are several reasons to expect lower solar activity during the 21st century , relative to the 20th century .\nThe recently completed solar cycle 24 was the smallest sunspot cycle in 100 years and the third in a trend of diminishing sunspot cycles .\nSome solar physicists expect cycle 25 to be even smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand maximum is more likely to be followed by a grand minimum than by another grand maximum .\nEmpirically-based projections imply a new solar minimum starting in 2002\u20132004 and ending in 2063\u20132075 .\nIt has been estimated that there is an 8 % chance of the Sun falling into a Grand Minimum during the next 40 years .\nHowever , the depth and length of a phase of low solar activity in the 21st century is largely uncertain .\nIf the Sun did fall into a minimum during mid 21st century of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much cooling could we expect ?\nEstimates from climate models and other analytical models expect the cooling to be small , ranging from 0.09 to 0.3oC .\nThese models assume that solar-climate interaction is limited to TSI forcing alone .\nRecent research suggest that solar indirect effects could amplify an anomaly in solar insolation by a factor of up to 3-7 .\nIf such an amplification factor is included , then a surface temperature decrease of up to 1oC ( or even more ) from a Maunder Minimum could occur .\nIn light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar variability in the mid 21st century are considered here : \u2022 Intermediate : -0.3oC , corresponds to high Maunder minimum estimate without amplification effects , or a weaker minimum with amplification effects \u2022 High : -0.6oC , a low solar scenario ( which is not a Maunder Minimum ) with amplification by solar indirect effects Synthetic scenarios building upon historical and paleo data , climate model outputs , process models and storylines based on physical reasoning provide a broader range of outcome scenarios than global climate model simulations , particularly with regards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented in the previous subsections are integrated here to assess how natural climate variability could change our expectations for the amount of warming expected by 2050 , in particular the years in which the 1.5 and 2.0oC thresholds will be crossed .\nAll of the scenarios of natural variability considered here point in the direction of cooling through 2050 , for reasons justified in the preceding subsections .\nThis analysis adopts the SSP2-4.5 emissions scenario as the most likely scenario to 2050 [ LINK ] , based on analyses by the IEA .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum of temperature changes driven by : \u2022 SSP2-4.5 emissions \u2013 3 scenarios that span the AR6 likely range ( +1.6 , +2.0 , +2.5oC ) , referenced to the baseline period 1851-1900 \u2022 Volcanoes \u2013 3 scenarios relative to a nominal baseline of -0.1oC in the CMIP6 simulations ( 0 , -0.17 , -0.4 oC ) , referenced to a baseline of 2020 \u2022 Solar \u2013 3 scenarios relative to a nominal baseline of -0.1oC in the CMIP6 simulations ( 0 , -0.2 , -0.5 oC ) , referenced to a baseline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three scenarios for each variable , we can produce a total of 81 scenarios by adding combinations of scenarios inputs for the individual variables .\nThree of these outcome scenarios correspond directly to the AR6 values associated with SSP2-4.5 , while the others include some combination of the scenarios of natural climate variability .\nFigure 1 shows a histogram of the 81 different scenario outcomes .\nThe outcome frequencies are indicated on the y-axis .\nFor reference the temperature in 2020 is 1.2oC above the 1851-1900 baseline , which is indicated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the most warming is 2.5oC , which corresponds to the upper bound of the likely range from the AR6 ( with no additional impacts from natural variability ) .\nThe scenario with the lowest amount of warming is 0.4oC , which corresponds to the lower bound of the AR6 likely range with the most extreme scenario for each of the components of natural variability \u2013 this extreme outcome scenario for 2050 is 0.8oC cooler than the temperature in 2020 .\nFigure 1 .\nDistribution of scenarios of global temperature change for 2050 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe vertical red line corresponds to 1.2oC , representing the warming to 2020 .\nThe y-axis is frequency of outcomes , based on 81 scenarios .\nThere is weak justification for providing likelihoods of the individual outcomes .\nWhile each of these scenario outcomes is arguably plausible , the distribution of outcomes in Figure 1 does not in any way reflect the probability of the outcomes .\nAre some of these scenarios more likely than others ?\nSelecting the intermediate scenario for each variable produces an outcome scenario of +1.43oC , indicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threshold before 2050 ( compared to an expected crossing circa 2030 using the AR6 best estimate for SSP2-4.5 ) .\nIt is seen in Figure 1 that for the intermediate scenario outcomes between 1.0 and 2.0oC , there are multiple pathways to the same temperature outcomes , supporting a greater likelihood for these intermediate outcomes .\nHowever , judgment about the likelihood of individual outcomes rests on the assessment of the likelihood of the individual input scenarios .\nAll of the components of natural variability point to cooling during the period 2020-2050 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ be large in the moderate scenarios .\nHowever when summed , their magnitude approaches , or could even exceed , the magnitude of the emissions-driven warming for the next three decades .\nThe odds of all three natural variability inputs maintaining at the IPCC baseline levels to 2050 seems low to me .\nStudies using global climate models to assess the probability of decades in the 21st century being characterized by net cooling have mostly focused only on natural internal variability ( Maher et al .\n2020 Knutson et al..2016 ) , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of that considers volcanic eruptions plus internal variability ( Bethke et al .\n2017 ) .\nVolcanic-induced cooling becomes increasingly important in facilitating neutral or negative temperature trends on longer timescales , in conjunction with natural internal variability effects .\nSeveral studies have addressed the combination of internal and solar variability LINK Apart from the \u2018 wild card \u2019 of volcanic eruptions , the big uncertainty is solar indirect effects .\nThe growing likelihood of a solar minimum of some magnitude during the mid 21st century emphasizes the need for a resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variability solar reconstructions , and improved understanding of solar indirect effects .\nThe bottom line is that uncertainty in global temperature projections to 2050 is skewed towards lower values , as uncertainty in near term scenarios of emissions is decreasing .\nThe confluence of cooling contributions from solar , volcanoes and natural internal variability during the period 2020-2050 could extend by decades the time horizon for keeping the global mean surface temperature below the thresholds of 1.5 and 2.0oC .\nThis extension has important implications for the urgency of emissions reductions and planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.5 and 2oC are easy to measure and communicate , and have been effective at galvanizing political will and public support .\nHowever , these targets are vague approximations to some of the dangers of climate change and mis-represent the nature of the scienti\ufb01c knowledge upon which these numbers are claimed to rest .\n( Hulme , Fetishizing the number )

cancer , and neurobiology , by conducting research on those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that knowledge that I raised the alert about a new epidemic likely to become a pandemic on January , 31st 2020 with an article in my blog in Spanish : \u201c Scenarios and consequences of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic \u201c It describes three possible scenarios , and how to protect oneself from the pandemic , a full month before most governments did anything about it .\nIn the end , the result was somewhat between the intermediate and worst-case scenarios I considered .\nIf you are curious about it , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I was being very alarmist .\nHad I been in charge , or chief advisor to those in charge , I would have handled the pandemic very differently , perhaps saving tens of thousands of lives in my country and reducing economic damage .\nWe talk a lot about being resilient , yet at the first serious test in decades we have demonstrated a lot more fragility than we expected .\nOn February , 25th 2020 , a full two weeks before my government did anything about the coming pandemic , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country ( it was already here ) , I published my final warning : \u201c Coronavirus scenario 2 : Enemy at the gates \u201c In it ( translate it if you wish ) I warned that the virus was airborne ( aerosols ) , a full 5 months before my government recognized it , and 14 months before the WHO did it .\nI also said that eradication of the disease was already nearly impossible , so the disease was likely to become endemic .\nSomething that was been recognized by my country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20th 2020 , before the issue became widely discussed by the media , I analyzed the evidence that pointed to an accidental release from the Wuhan Institute of Virology : \u201c Possible release of the coronavirus from a Chinese laboratory \u201c That was my opinion at the time when it was improper to say so , and it is my opinion today .\nThose are my credentials .\nI saw it coming .\nI knew what was going to happen .\nI understood the nature of the disease .\nI could do very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and friends .\nThere have been no COVID casualties among those close to me and I like to think that listening to me helped them keep safe .\nI watched in horror as the pandemic developed like a slow-moving train wreck .\nWe will be suffering the social and economic consequences for years .\n2 .\nThe nature of the disease There are two types of immunity : innate immunity and acquired ( adaptive ) immunity .\nWhen we face a new infective disease that is unrelated to any disease or vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innate immunity can help us .\nInnate immunity is strong in very young children and virtually non-existent in very old people as it decays with age and immunosenescence .\nThat takes us to the nature of the problem .\nSARS-CoV-2 is not the cause of COVID .\nThe cause of COVID is an improper reaction of the immune system to SARS-CoV-2 infection .\nThis is demonstrated by the huge amount of asymptomatic infected people , and by the chronic infection without deleterious effect of immunosuppressed people .\nSee for example : \u201c Long-Term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma , \u201d for a patient infected for over 6 months .\nIt is not the virus what will put you in hospital , but the inability of your immune system to properly handle the infection .\nThe improper reaction to the infection is due to it being a new disease , so it must be dealt with by innate immunity .\nThe body can support a huge viral load without developing symptoms .\nThis is known from the existence of asymptomatic super-spreaders .\nHowever , lack of proper innate immunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cytokine responses that can kill the patient .\nThat \u2019 s why COVID patients in hospital are treated with corticosteroids that are immunosuppressants , besides being anti-inflammatory .\nOmicron is about 10 times less dangerous than previous variants because it is a predominantly upper respiratory tract resident , less likely to trigger a strong improper immune reaction .\nIn exchange , there are less asymptomatic people , as most infected ones develop cold-like symptoms .\nThis is the first wave that we can get with an acceptable level of risk .\nBut that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the disease , I \u2019 ve had to confront three successive myths about respiratory viruses .\nEarly on was the idea that the arrival of the warm season would help with the disease by preventing summer waves .\nAlthough it is not exactly known why some viruses display strong seasonality , it seems to be a combination of environmental factors , human behavior , and temporary herd immunity locked to the annual cycle .\nFor a largely naive population there was nothing that could prevent a summer wave , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place during that summer in Spain , to the dismay of our tourism industry .\nIt might take a few years for SARS-CoV-2 to develop flu-like seasonality .\nThe strong Christmas Omicron wave in Europe is a step in that direction .\nAnother myth was herd immunity .\nI never bought into the idea that this applied to a rapidly mutating RNA virus .\nAdditionally , the experience with the other four human coronaviruses is that people can get infected every year .\nThe viruses don \u2019 t induce long-lasting immunity .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries developed their strategy around that faulty concept .\nIn my country it was clearly another government lie to convince people to get the vaccine , because this is well known by experts .\nMy government said the problem would be over if we reached 60 % vaccination .\nNo \u201c expert \u201d dared to contradict them in public .\nWe passed 80 % vaccination rate and then had the biggest wave in the pandemic .\nThe third myth is that viruses evolve to cause less damage to the host .\nAnybody that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book \u201c Spillover \u201d by

evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is towards causing less damage because to outcompete other variants the logical path is to migrate to the upper respiratory tract , as Omicron has done , to become more contagious .\nUpper respiratory tract infections are generally less dangerous than lower respiratory tract infections .\nI was fully vaccinated with Pfizer in June 2021 , my strategy was to have my vitamin D levels way up and catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of a strong wave in Spain during Christmas .\nI could not get it on purpose because I don \u2019 t live alone and this is not a decision that can be taken for other people , as there are significant risks involved .\nBut if you let youngsters do what they want to do , they will bring it home .\nI developed my first symptoms on January 5 .\nI was taking vitamin A , C , and D , and I started taking Polaramine ( antihistamine ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , the main problem is the immune system , not the virus .\nI was also doing throat washes with Listerine and diluted hydrogen peroxide every few hours to reduce viral load near its center of action .\nThe lower the viral load the lower the risk .\nDespite that , when the infection was receding , I had elevated blood pressure for a few days , together with fatigue .\nI think the high blood pressure was due to a decrease in blood oxygen levels , but I didn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health system was under a lot of stress and I know how to reduce my blood pressure through intermittent fasting and exercise .\nMy symptoms completely disappeared in two weeks and I am now completely recovered and naturally immunized .\nUnder no circumstances is this to be construed as a recommendation to voluntarily get COVID .\nIt is a dangerous disease .\nEvery responsible adult should manage their health risk as any other aspect of their life .\nThis is discussed in section 5 below .\nAnd it is very important that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a dead-end to the virus by not infecting anybody , through following the recommended quarantine instructions from your health authorities .\nTo me the COVID story has ended .\nI will keep my vitamin D levels high between equinoxes and the winter solstice and will not get any more shots regardless of what the \u201c experts \u201d and governments or the WHO might say .\nThe RNA vaccines have a level of risk that would be unacceptable under different circumstances .\nThey have a significant toxicity level .\nThe lipid nanoparticle platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be related to the vaccine side-effects , but necessary for its immune action .\nPeople that die from the vaccine can go very fast .\nA close friend of mine is a pharmacist , and he had a 35-year-old person come to his pharmacy the same day of his vaccination feeling very bad , he was dead the next day .\nSome of the deaths have been linked to thrombocytopenia , low blood platelet count .\nIn most cases post-vaccine deaths affect elderly frail people often with co-morbidities .\nThe chief pathologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged more autopsies of recently vaccinated people that died and was severely criticized for such a reasonable suggestion .\nClearly the authorities want to underplay vaccination risks .\nThe reported number of deaths from the vaccine is very low , about 8 per million , much lower than the number of deaths from COVID , and even much lower than background deaths .\nNevertheless , the small risk of dying is not the only risk from the new vaccines .\nI don \u2019 t like the RNA nature of these vaccines .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single shot is huge , in the same order of magnitude as the number of cells in our body .\nInstead of being delivered to the mucosa , like the virus , they are unevenly distributed throughout the body by the lymphatic and circulatory systems ( the liver appears to be a preferred target ) , where they get into the wrong cells and mark them for destruction by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes .\nThe issue of improper COVID vaccine tissue tropism and its safety concerns is rarely raised .\nI feared from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people might develop autoimmune diseases from it , and it is already happening : \u201c New-onset autoimmune phenomena post-COVID-19 vaccination.\n\u201d Getting an autoimmune disease from the vaccine is for life and much worse than COVID for most people .\nOne might develop an autoimmune disease from the vaccine years after getting the shot .\nEvery additional shot increases the risk .\nThere is a false sense of security in people going for additional vaccine immunizations .\nIt makes no sense to vaccinate children ( with some exceptions ) because it doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t help society .\nThe risk of developing future effects is unacceptable at that age .\nRepeated vaccinations with RNA vaccines are likely to have more negative than positive effects .\nOld people might need annual shots to manage their much higher risk .\nHopefully better , safer vaccines will be developed in the future .\nRisk management is the process of identification and assessment of risks , and development of strategies to reduce and manage the identified risks .\nThe strategies to manage risk include avoiding the risk , reducing its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its consequences .\nRisk aversion might not be the optimal strategy if it incurs a large cost of opportunity .\nBeing a responsible adult means accepting the responsibility for managing life risks .\nTransferring that responsibility to a government or organization might not be a good way of managing some risks .\nIn the case of COVID , risk management indicates the best strategy for any adult is to get vaccinated to have some acquired immunity when they get the disease .\nThe risk from the vaccine is thousands of times lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older than 45 .\nOnly stupid old people face the infection without having been vaccinated with the two shots .\nSome acquired immunity from the vaccine is much better than none .\nA true life and death difference for many .\nUnless one is prepared to live like a hermit we must all accept that sooner or later we will be infected by SARS-CoV-2 , the same way we all get colds and the flu .\nVery old and frail people , and people with serious pre-conditions might want to delay that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every winter if they perceive than their risk from COVID must be avoided at all cost .\nFor the rest , particularly for people younger than 65 without pre-conditions there are a lot of options to manage COVID risk : A ) Before you get it \u2013 Keep your vitamin D levels high at all times .\nIt is a very important regulator of the immune system .\nSunbathing for a limited time 3-4 times a week is the best way .\nTake supplements and/or get it in the diet when you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a healthy lifestyle .\nReduce your weight , exercise regularly , eat a healthy diet , and get enough sleep .\nSleep deprivation wrecks the immune system , as does undernutrition .\n\u2013 Consider resetting your immune system through 2-3 days of fasting once or twice a year , but do not get infected while fasting .\nMany useless immune cells get cleared during deep fasting sharpening our immune response afterwards .\n\u2013 Choose when to get infected .\nMaximal effect from a vaccine shot is obtained 2-3 weeks after , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months it is very much reduced .\nSome parents used to get their kids exposed to chickenpox to make sure they were protected by the mild form of the disease during childhood .\nB ) Once you get it If you develop symptoms and suspect you \u2019 ve got COVID , or test positive , there are many things you can do to reduce your risk .\n\u2013 Take plenty of vitamin D , C , and A , and drink plenty of liquids .\nZinc and selenium supplements are also helpful .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an antiseptic every few hours to reduce viral load .\nA 1-1.5 % hydrogen peroxide solution also works well since it attacks proteins in the viral membrane .\n\u2013 Take Polaramine ( 2 mg twice a day ) or some other antihistamine to reduce the risk of an improper immune response .\nRead the prospect to see if you can take it safely or follow your doctor \u2019 s advice .\nThere are several other recommendations that you might follow , but these are no-regrets measures that should not cause you any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is not a recommendation to voluntarily get COVID .\nIt is a serious disease with potentially lethal consequences .\nEverybody will have to manage their own risk .\nHow your immune system has behaved in

lack scientific rigour , the consequence being that climate change risk and uncertainties are poorly presented .\nThe climate change field needs to strengthen its risk science basis , to improve the current situation.\n\u201d \u2013 Norwegian risk scientist Terje Aven For decision-makers , climate change is a problem in risk assessment and management .\nClimate change is a risk because it may affect prosperity and security in a negative way , and because its consequences are uncertain .\nGlobal climate change policy has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management \u2013 the Precautionary Principle as a justification for setting specific targets for the elimination of manmade emissions of carbon dioxide .\nIn the early 1980 \u2019 s , the United Nations Environmental Program ( UNEP ) became bullish on the idea that fossil fuels would produce dangerous climate change .\nThe prospect of eliminating fossil fuels was congruent with UNEP \u2019 s broader interests in environmental quality and world governance .\nAt Villach in 1985 at the beginning of the climate treaty movement , the policy movement to eliminate fossil fuels became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 the rhetoric of precaution argued that we should act anyway to eliminate fossil fuels , just in case .\nThis perspective became codified by the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) Treaty in 1992 , the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 and the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement .\nInstead of framing the IPCC assessments around risk assessment , the IPCC reports narrowly framed its assessments to support the UNFCCC policies , focusing on dangerous climate change associated with fossil fuel emissions .\nThe torquing of climate science and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate change not only oversimplified the scientific and social challenges , but led to the adoption of a \u201c predict then act \u201d strategy to manage and control , supporting decisions about elimination of fossil fuel emissions that were begun in the 1980 \u2019 s .\nThe congruence of the of the IPCC assessments and UNFCCC policies enforces the belief that climate change is a simple or tame problem , with science trumping all practical questions and conflicting values and purposes .\nThis strategy of risk management implies that climate change is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d This characterization has led to the relative neglect of climate risk in formal assessment processes such as the IPCC .\nIt is only in their most recent assessment report , AR6 , that a consistent risk framing of climate change was attempted ( it will be interesting to see what this looks like in the forthcoming WGII , III reports ) .\nAs a result of the early adoption of a preferred risk management strategy , we are far from a complete assessment of full climate risk .\nBy characterizing climate change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consensus , traditional risk management approaches assume that climate change can and ought to be rationally managed , or at the very least contained , and preferably eliminated .\nHowever , the diversity of climate-related impact drivers and their complex linkages , various inherent and irreducible uncertainties , ambiguities about the consequences of climate change , and the unequal distribution of exposure and effects across geography and time , confound any simple or uncontested application of traditional risk management approaches .\nAs a result , the policy process that has evolved over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with the risks associated with climate change , but has fueled societal controversies around climate risk .\nRisk has often been characterized as some type of statistical expected value \u2013 the product of the likelihood of occurrence and the impact .\nHowever , such a characterization is appropriate only for simple , or tame , problems .\nBroader definitions of risk integrate specified consequences of an event or actions , a measure of uncertainty associated with the consequences , and the strength of the background knowledge that supports the assessment .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u201c best available \u201d knowledge base is not inconsistent with acknowledging significant weaknesses in the knowledge base in context of climate risk analysis .\nAn important element of characterizing risk is evaluating the strength of knowledge .\nConcerns about strength of the knowledge base are raised by people questioning aspects of the IPCC \u2019 s assessment that are used to infer climate risk .\nThe IPCC approach is based on judgement of the available evidence and agreement among experts .\nMore sophisticated knowledge characterizations for risk management ( Aven 2017b ) include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumptions made are reasonable/realistic \u2013 growing concern about the focus on implausible emissions scenarios RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5 .\n\u2022 the degree to which data/information exists and are reliable and relevant \u2013 the historical and paleo data base is inadequate for a full , global characterization of natural climate variability on multi-decadal to millennial time scales \u2022 the degree to which there is disagreement among experts ( including those from different environments ) \u2013 attempts to suppress disagreement and alternative perspectives among experts \u2022 the degree to which the phenomena involved are understood and accurate models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utility of climate models .\n\u2022 the degree to which the knowledge has been thoroughly examined with respect to unknown knowns ( i.e .\nothers , but not the analysis group , have the knowledge ) \u2013 neglect of the unknown knowns associated with natural climate variability .\nThe politics of international climate governance has produced systematic biases in the kinds of expertise and evidence that are deemed appropriate for consideration .\n( Lucas ) The UNFCCC and IPCC have characterized climate change as an environmental and economic problem , and geoscientists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making process .\nHowever , the issues with the current CO increase and warming are social , not environmental .\nThe Earth has undergone geological periods of higher temperatures and atmospheric CO concentrations , during which life thrived .\nCharacterization of climate change as an environmental problem has downplayed the cultural and political dimensions of the issue .\nMany social scientists have argued that the disciplinary constrictions imposed by the IPCC and UNFCCC have neglected many important insights arising from a wide range of expert and unaccredited sources .\nA risk assessment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with high levels of complexity , uncertainty and ambiguity \u2013 must include the following elements ( King et al .\n2015 ) : \u2022 Clarify objectives of the risk analysis \u2013 the dangers or values at risk \u2022 Take a holistic view of all relevant factors \u2022 Be explicit about value judgements One of the biggest problems associated with climate change risk assessments is that there is no simple way to articulate danger associated with a warmer climate .\nHowever , in attempting to build political will for the international treaties , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been exaggerated \u2013 severe weather/climate events , sea level rise and many adverse ecosystem , health , economic and geopolitical impacts , with all of their complex causes , were confounded with fossil-fuel driven warming .\nFurther , the risks from fossil fuel emissions have not been placed in the appropriate context of other global and regional risks .\nA key element of risk assessment is to judge whether activities are acceptable , tolerable , or intolerable .\nActivities are tolerable if they are considered as worth pursuing for the associated benefits .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction or coping are welcomed provided that the benefits of the activities are not lost .\nBurning fossil fuels has historically been considered a tolerable risk .\nGenuinely intolerable risks include existential threats \u2013 such as portrayed by the earth-impacting comet in the move Don \u2019 t Look Up \u2013 or \u201c ruin \u201d problems .\nFor less dire threats that are considered intolerable , notwithstanding the bene\ufb01ts , risk management should be focused on banning or phasing out the activity creating the risk or , if that is not possible , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways or to increase societal resilience .\nHow to draw the lines between \u201c acceptable \u201d , \u201c tolerable \u201d and \u201c intolerable \u2019 \u2019 is one of the most controversial tasks in the risk governance process for complex risks .\nAmbiguity results from divergent and contested perspectives on the justi\ufb01cation , severity or wider meanings associated with a perceived threat ( Stirling 2003 ) .\nClimate change risks have been characterized as acceptable , tolerable and intolerable by different individuals and constituencies \u2013 clearly an ambiguous situation .\n\u201c Ambiguity \u201d means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to evaluate whether there are , or could be , adverse effects and whether these risks are tolerable .\nAmbiguity results from divergent and contested perspectives on the justi\ufb01cation , severity or wider meanings associated with a perceived threat ( Stirling 2003 ) .\nSubjective value judgments are inherent both in identifying what constitutes a risk , and in deciding how much we care about it .\nAll formal climate change risk assessments are structured by underlying values and normative goals that are sometimes explicit but often hidden .\nThese values include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , misperceptions of risk , and implicit judgements on the acceptability or aversion to inequality in society .\nJudgments of intolerable risks from climate change relate to mistakenly conflating the slow creep of global warming with consequences associated with extreme weather and climate events , concerns about inequitable risk exposure to poorer populations , and concerns about future generations .\nClimate change risk includes elements of both incremental risk ( e.g .\nthe slow creep of sea level rise ) and emergency risk .\nEmergency risks are associated with extreme weather events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not climate risks , even if global warming could be shown to incrementally worsen the weather hazard .\nWeather risk can become climate risk if global warming causes the event to exceed a vulnerability threshold that otherwise wouldn \u2019 t have been exceeded by the weather event .\nAttempts are also made to assess incremental costs/damages associated with extreme weather events .\nSuch assessments are very challenging to make against the background of natural weather and climate variability .\nRemoving the risk from most extreme weather and climate events from the consequences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reducing fossil fuel emissions .\nMischaracterizing incremental risks as urgent has led to policies that are not only costly and suboptimal , but also arguably reduce resilience .\nThe poorest populations would benefit far more from access to grid electricity and help in reducing vulnerability from extreme weather events , than from reductions to the amount of CO in the atmosphere .\nMoralizing surrounding the issue of climate change has regarded the climate change problem as a simple , righteous values choice : Are you for the planet or against it ?\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in activities which are of value to them that happen to emit carbon as a byproduct .\nFurther , this narrow moralizing systematically excludes important ethical values , such as improving the lives of the billion people presently living in unacceptable poverty or protecting other aspects of the environment .\nThe question of intergenerational equity ( concerns about the grandchildren ) is of special importance as there is a lag between the emissions of greenhouse gases and the occurrence of the damage .\nThere is no simple way to decide what duty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the IPCC \u2019 s socioeconomic pathways for the 21st century all have the world being better off by 2100 , even under the most extreme emissions scenarios .\nWith this context , we need a broader ethical debate about what the consequences of climate change will be for what we humans have reason to value so that we can take credible actions to protect them .\nThis requires an equally careful consideration of beneficial as well as adverse consequences .\nThe IPCC assessments have focused on the likely range of warming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs I have discussed in many previous blog posts , the IPCC scenarios of 21st century climate do not provide a holistic perspective on 21st century climate change \u2013 they neglect a range of plausible scenarios of solar variability , volcanic eruptions , and multi-decadal to millennial natural internal variability .\nTheir interpretation of extreme weather and climate events is drawn from data since 1950 \u2013 ignoring longer historical data sets and paleo climate data sets .\nThe bottom line is that the IPCC has not provided a complete set of plausible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While models can be useful for understanding complex systems , factors that fall outside the consideration of a model should not be ignored .\nWhen a system is impossible to model in a meaningful way , scenarios may be developed to imagine its possible future states .\nIn addition to the risks associated with increased CO concentrations and the risks of rapidly transitioning away from fossil fuels , there is a need to recognized that natural climate variability and change along with extreme weather and climate events have equally important societal impacts .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissions of non-CO greenhouse gases and aerosol particles plus land use changes .\nFor the first time in the AR6 , attention is given to identifying worst case outcomes , beyond its misguided focus on the implausible RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5 emissions scenarios .\nThe AR6 treatment of sea level rise is exemplary in this regard , clarifying the strength of the knowledge base associated with different extreme scenarios .\nThe AR6 focus on regional climate change rightfully pulls away from the previous strategy of climate model generated scenarios as being adequate for this purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenarios .\nThe historical data record , especially when it extends back into the 19th century , is arguably the richest source of extreme weather and climate scenarios for the 21st century .\nHow to assess the plausibility of scenarios involving a high level risk is a topic that has received too little attention .\nSocial ampli\ufb01cation of risk can occur via responses to perceived outcomes , either in anticipation or in reaction .\nThe UNFCCC in its urgent drive for NETZERO emissions ignores transition risk .\nConsequences of a rapid transition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transition , adverse environmental impacts associated with wind and solar energy and biofuels , impacts of the intermittency of renewable energy on energy reliability and cost , more complex and extensive electricity transmission infrastructure with a larger number of failure nodes , decrease in energy security , the extensive need for rare earth minerals and the associated changes in geopolitics .\nThese consequences of the transition are associated with a fairly solid knowledge base , leading many people to be more concerned about transition risks than they are about the more uncertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far weaker knowledge base .\nThe debate is then between tolerable but potentially unnecessary imposition of risks from the rapid transition away from fossil fuels , versus the highly uncertain impacts from climate change that are assessed as ranging from acceptable to intolerable by different individuals , countries and organizations .\nThe biggest risk from a rapid transition away from fossil fuels is arguably an opportunity cost \u2013 we are at risk of squandering our resources on effort that may not change the climate in a meaningful way , so that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions that improve human well-being in both the short and long terms .\nFurther , we are ignoring other risks that are arguably more important to near-term human well being that could be more productively addressed with the same resources .\nThe UNFCCC is promoting a solution to an exceedingly complex , uncertain and ambiguous problem , without the context of an adequate risk assessment that references the wider ethical issues and political and practical feasibility .\nAs a result , we have neglected to truly understand the the climate system and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural systems , and to systematically and broadly evaluate the feasible policy space .\nThe end result is that after 30 years of the UNFCCC/IPCC , we are fixated on the minutiae of greenhouse gas emissions levels and the abstract and impossible problem of constraining atmospheric CO concentration \u2013 while ignoring natural climate variability and drastically simplifying the human side .\nAs long as the current situation prevails , the IPCC \u2019 s assessments of anthropogenic climate change and the UNFCCC recommendations for action will remain seriously inadequate .", "author": "curryja", "url": "https://judithcurry.com/2022/02/19/how-we-have-mischaracterized-climate-risk/", "published": "Sat, 19 Feb

Green Delusions Empowered Putin .\nExcerpts : How is it possible that European countries , Germany especially , allowed themselves to become so dependent on an authoritarian country over the 30 years since the end of the Cold War ?\nHere \u2019 s how : These countries are in the grips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incapable of understanding the hard realities of energy production .\nGreen ideology insists we don \u2019 t need nuclear and that we don \u2019 t need fracking .\nIt insists that it \u2019 s just a matter of will and money to switch to all-renewables\u2014and fast .\nIt insists that we need \u201c degrowth \u201d of the economy , and that we face looming human \u201c extinction.\n\u201d While Putin expanded Russia \u2019 s oil production , expanded natural gas production , and then doubled nuclear energy production to allow more exports of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Germany , shut down its nuclear power plants , closed gas fields , and refused to develop more through advanced methods like fracking .\nThe numbers tell the story best .\nIn 2016 , 30 percent of the natural gas consumed by the European Union came from Russia .\nIn 2018 , that figure jumped to 40 percent .\nBy 2020 , it was nearly 44 percent , and by early 2021 , it was nearly 47 percent .\nFor all his fawning over Putin , Donald Trump , back in 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany publicly for its dependence on Moscow .\n\u201c Germany , as far as I \u2019 m concerned , is captive to Russia because it \u2019 s getting so much of its energy from Russia , \u201d Trump said .\nThe result has been the worst global energy crisis since 1973 , driving prices for electricity and gasoline higher around the world .\nIt is a crisis , fundamentally , of inadequate supply .\nBut the scarcity is entirely manufactured .\n\u201c Energy security , which has too often been overlooked as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , requires new prioritization and a rethink .\nEurope \u2019 s excessive reliance on Russian natural gas and America \u2019 s excessive reliance on stable oil markets have both limited the West \u2019 s options in this crisis to the detriment of our collective security.\n\u201d \u201c Europe offers another reminder to the U.S. that blocking fossil-fuel development here won \u2019 t keep carbon \u201c in the ground.\n\u201d It merely hands a strategic weapon to dictators that they will turn around and use against us.\n\u201d With regards to green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( impacts , adaptation , vulnerability ) was released earlier this week .\nThe IPCC \u2019 s press release on the new report was headlined \u201c Climate change : a threat to human wellbeing and health of the planet \u201d .\nIts stark opening detailed \u201c dangerous and widespread disruption \u201d .\nThe closing statement of the WGII report is any further delay in global action to slow climate change and adapt to its impacts \u201c will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a livable and sustainable future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hyperbole is meant to camouflage the fact that the weakest part of the UNFCCC/IPCC argument is that human-caused warming is \u2018 dangerous \u2019 .\nThese statements are made despite the fact that the Summary for Policy Makers states , with high confidence , that disasters and violent conflicts are not significantly influenced by human-caused climate change .\nFurther , the AR6 WGII report relies heavily on the implausible SSP5-8.5 emissions scenarios , which implausibly hypes the impacts of warming .\nAnd even the emphasis on SSP5-8.5 scenario fails to acknowledge that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally in the climate change field not talking about futures that are worse than today \u201d \u2013 A quote from Brian O \u2019 Neill , a lead creator of the SSP scenarios for the IPCC .\n[ link ] The WGII report convolves natural weather and climate variability , land use , and various types of vulnerabilities with human-caused climate change , which is a relatively minor player in the world \u2019 s complex problems that are related to human interactions with the environment .\n\u201c Regrettably , the IPCC WG2 has strayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluate the scientific literature , and has positioned itself much more as a cheerleader for emissions reductions and produced a report that supports such advocacy .\nThe IPCC exhorts : \u201c impacts will continue to increase if drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions are further delayed \u2013 affecting the lives of today \u2019 s children tomorrow and those of their children much more than ours \u2026 Any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a livable future.\n\u201d This new emphasis on mitigation colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reads as if adaptation is secondary to mitigation or even impossible .\nOf course , adaptation has long been viewed as problematic in climate policy and politics .\nRather than supporting an apocalyptic view of ever-worsening impacts as a simple function of temperature increases , adaptation opportunities allow for positive human outcomes even as the climate changes .\nThe WG2 misrepresentation of the literature of flooding is repeated throughout the report for other phenomena .\nAdaptation is often ignored or minimized in favor of presenting impacts as worsening a function of ever-increasing temperatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential to result in positive human futures at a wide range of levels of future emissions and temperature changes .\nMitigation and adaptation are both important and the IPCC WG2 did itself and us a huge disservice by adding mitigation to its focus.\n\u201d The prevailing thinking that energy policy should be dictated by the UNFCCC imperative to eliminate carbon emissions ignores the dominant importance of energy security , reliability and cost .\nTom Pyle sums it up with this statement [ link ] : \u201c The west is seeing the results of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swedish teenagers , former bar tenders and washed up socialists .\nWe need grown ups running energy policy.\n\u201d With regards to energy policy in the face of the Ukraine war , UNFCCC agreements , and general pragmatism , there are 3 time scales to consider : \u2022 tactical \u2013 time scales of a few months .\nReducing the demand for natural gas and influencing the price of oil/gas and hamper Russia \u2019 s economic situation \u2022 strategic \u2013 time scale of 1-3 years , with policies that can ensure stable gas/oil/coal supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their winter season \u2022 long-term \u2013 a slower transition away from fossil fuels ( especially those produced by hostile countries ) that ensures energy security and reliability and low costs through the transition period .\nOn the tactical time scale , we have : releasing petroleum reserve into the global market , restarting any available nuclear power plants , burning coal .\nOn the strategic time scale \u2013 ramp up oil and natural gas output from North America .\nFill up the Alaskan pipeline .\nIn 2021 , after finally achieving energy independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave that up as the Biden Administration brought fresh rounds of fossil fuel suppression .\nPrepare additional terminals to ship and receive LNG .\nStart the process of building more nuclear power plants .\nInstall heat pumps , which eliminates the reliance on natural gas for heating .\nRosenow explained on Twitter how replacing gas boilers with heat pumps would cut gas demand , even if the electricity driving them was generated using gas .\nLiberate all forms of energy .\nOn the long term time scale \u2013 drop the emissions targets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21st century electricity and transportation energy sources and infrastructure , planning for much more energy than we are currently using .\nFocus on energy security , with autonomous in-country sourcing where possible , then near-sourcing and then other ally-sourcing ( avoid buying energy from political enemies or otherwise unstable regimes ) .\nEvaluate energy sources and infrastructures for cost , reliability , emissions , and other environmental impacts .\nKeep current energy systems running until their end of life , or when replacement systems are fully operational .\nEvaluate transition risks , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closure of its nuclear power plants , and is considering burning coal in the near term .\nThe Ukraine War has disrupted energy business as usual .\nApart from working towards more autonomy for Europe , hopefully this event will provide political momentum that motivates an energy transition that puts energy security first .\nThe reality is that Europe will depend on gas as a transition fuel until sufficient flexible , low-carbon energy can be deployed .", "author": "curryja",

National Academies ( 2013 ) Abrupt Impacts of Climate Change : Anticipating Surprises \u201d \u2018 As recently as the 1980s , the typical view of major climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paced by the changes in solar energy that accompany predictable variations in Earth \u2019 s orbit around the sun over thousands to tens of thousands of years ( Hays et al.\n, 1976 ) .\nWhile some early studies of rates of climate change , particularly during the last glacial period and the transition from glacial to interglacial climates , found large changes in apparently short periods of time ( e.g.\n, Coope et al.\n, 1971 ) , most of the paleoclimate records reaching back tens of thousands of years lacked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes .\nThis situation began to change in the late 1980s as scientists began to examine events such as the climate transition that occurred at the end of the Younger Dryas about 12,000 years ago ( e.g.\n, Dansgaard et al.\n, 1989 ) and the large swings in climate during the glacial period that have come to be termed \u201c Dansgaard-Oescher events \u201d ( \u201c D-O events ; \u201d named after two of the ice core scientists who first studied these phenomena using ice cores ) .\nAt first these variations seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast to be climatic changes , and it was only after they were found in several ice cores ( e.g.\n, Anklin et al.\n, 1993 ; Grootes et al.\n, 1993 ) , and in many properties ( e.g.\n, Alley et al.\n, 1993 ) , including greenhouse gases ( e.g.\n, Severinghaus and Brook , 1999 ) that they became widely accepted as real.\n\u2019 More recently , Tim Lenton et al .\n( 2020 ) have written a paper : \u2018 The growing threat of abrupt and irreversible climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on emissions.\n\u2019 \u2013 A 1990 geography coursework reading list included \u2018 Fluvial geomorphology of Australia \u2019 .\nMore particularly , a paper by Wayne Erskine and Robin Warner on flood and drought dominated regimes ( FDR and DDR ) set me wondering .\nWhy for God \u2019 s sake are there multidecadal regimes and sudden shifts in eastern Australian rainfall ?\nENSO was clearly involved \u2013 but the PDO wasn \u2019 t described for nearly another

.\nRoemmich et al ( 2007 ) suggest that mid-latitude gyres in all of the oceans are influenced by decadal variability in the Southern and Northern Annular Modes ( SAM and NAM respectively ) as wind

addressing climate change and the energy transition", "content": "I have a new article published in the latest issue of International Affairs Forum .\nThe topic of this issue is Climate Change and Energy .\nMine is one of twenty papers .\nA range of topics are covered .\nMy article is the least alarmed among them .\nYou may recognize several of the authors , which include Don Wuebbles and Bill McKibben .\nHere is the text of my article : A \u2018 Plan B \u2019 for addressing climate change and the energy transition Climate change is increasingly being referred to as a crisis , emergency , existential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red.\n\u2019 Climate change has become a grand narrative in which manmade global warming is regarded as the dominant cause of societal problems .\nEverything that goes wrong reinforces the conviction that that there is only one thing we can do prevent societal problems \u2013 stop burning fossil fuels .\nThis grand narrative leads us to think that if we urgently stop burning fossil fuels , then these other problems would also be solved .\nThis sense of urgency narrows the viewpoints and policy options that we are willing to consider in dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems , but also regarding complex issues such as public health , water resources , weather disasters and national security .\nSo , exactly what is wrong with this grand narrative of climate change ?\nIn a nutshell , we \u2019 ve vastly oversimplified both the problem of climate change and its solutions .\nThe complexity , uncertainty , and ambiguity of the existing knowledge about climate change is being kept away from the policy and public debates .\nThe dangers of manmade climate change have been confounded with natural weather and climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed for rapidly eliminating fossil fuels are technologically and politically infeasible on a global scale .\nHow did we come to the point where we \u2019 re alleged to have a future crisis on our hands , but the primary solution of rapid global emissions reductions is deemed to be all but impossible ?\nThe source of this conundrum is that we have mischaracterized climate change as a tame problem , with a simple solution .\nClimate change is better characterized as a wicked mess .\nA wicked problem is complex with dimensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with time .\nA mess is characterized by resistance to change and contradictory and suboptimal solutions that create additional problems .\nTreating a wicked mess as if it is a tame problem can result in a situation where the cure is not only ineffective , but worse than the alleged disease .\nSpecifically with regards to climate science , there is some good news .\nRecent analyses from the International Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) and the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) indicate that the extreme tail risks from global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and high climate sensitivity , have shrunk and are now regarded as unlikely if not implausible .\nFurther , the IPCC \u2019 s climate projections neglect plausible scenarios of natural climate variability , which are acknowledged to dominate regional climate variability on interannual to multidecadal time scales .\nApart from the relative importance of natural climate variability , emissions reductions will do little to improve the climate of the 21st century \u2013 if you believe the climate models , most of the impacts of emissions reductions will be felt in the 22nd century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for an energy transition ?\nUnder the auspices of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , the world is attempting to reach Netzero in carbon emissions by 2050 .\nI refer to this as Plan A .\nUsing the precautionary principle , Plan A is based on the premise that rapidly reducing CO emissions is critical for preventing future dangerous warming of the climate .\nIn spite of the numerous UN treaties and agreements to reduce emissions over the past two decades , the atmospheric CO concentration relentlessly continues to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dominated by whatever China and India have done , or have failed to do .\nThe IEA Roadmap to Netzero finds that there is a possible but very narrow pathway to Netzero by 2050 , provided that there is a huge leap in energy innovation and major efforts to build new infrastructure .\nOthers find reaching Netzero by 2050 to be a social and technological impossibility .\nTerms such as \u2018 climate crisis \u2019 and \u2018 code red for humanity \u2019 are used by politicians and policy makers to emphasize the urgency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNote that the IPCC itself does not use the words \u2018 crisis \u2019 , \u2018 catastrophe \u2019 , or even \u2018 dangerous \u2019 ; rather it uses the term \u2018 reasons for concern.\n\u2019 Apart from the scientific uncertainties , the weakest part of the UN \u2019 s argument about manmade global warming is that it is dangerous .\nThe highest profile link to danger relies on linking warming to worsening extreme weather events , which is a tenuous link at best .\nAny evaluation of dangerous climate change must confront the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too hot versus too cold ?\nSome answer this question by stating that the climate we are adapted to is \u2018 just right \u2019 .\nHowever , the IPCC uses a preindustrial baseline , in the late 1700 \u2019 s .\nWhy anyone thinks that this is an ideal climate is not obvious .\nThis was during the Little Ice Age , the coldest period of the millennia .\nIn the U.S. , the states with by far the largest population growth are Florida and Texas , which are warm , southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its vulnerability to sea level rise and hurricanes \u2013 is skyrocketing in value .\nPersonal preference and market value do not yet regard global warming as dangerous .\nWhile politicians in developed countries argue that we need to address climate change for the sake developing countries , addressing climate change ranks much lower in these countries than developing access to grid electricity .\nThe planet has been warming for more than a century .\nSo far , the world has done a decent job at adapting to this change .\nThe yields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quadruped since 1960 .\nOver the past century , the number of deaths per million people from weather and climate catastrophes have dropped by 97 % .\nLosses from global weather disasters as a percent of GDP have declined over the past 30 years .\nIn addressing the challenges of climate change and the energy transition , we need to remind ourselves that addressing climate change isn \u2019 t an end in itself , and that climate change is not the only problem that the world is facing .\nThe objective should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , while protecting the environment as much as we can .\nAll other things being equal , everyone would prefer clean over dirty energy .\nHowever , all other things are not equal .\nWe need secure , reliable , and economic energy systems for all countries in the world .\nThis includes Africa , which is currently lacking grid electricity in many countries .\nWe need a 21st century infrastructure for our electricity and transportation systems , to support continued and growing prosperity .\nThe urgency of rushing to implement 20th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inadequate energy infrastructure , increasing our vulnerability to weather and climate extremes and harming our environment in new ways .\nHow the climate of the 21st century will play out is a topic of deep uncertainty .\nOnce natural climate variability is accounted for , it may turn out to be relatively benign .\nOr we may be faced with unanticipated surprises .\nWe need to increase our resiliency to whatever the future climate presents us with .\nWe are shooting ourselves in the foot if we sacrifice economic prosperity and overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transitioning to 20th century renewable energy technologies .\nAlarmism about climate change misleads us and panic makes us less likely to tackle climate change smartly .\nEven without the mandate associated with global warming and other environmental issues , we would expect a natural transition away from fossil fuels over the course of the 21st century , as they become more expensive to extract and continue to contribute to geopolitical instability .\nThe problem is with the urgency of transitioning away from fossil fuels , driven by fears about global warming .\nBy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy driven by renewables , we \u2019 re taking a big step backwards in human development and prosperity .\nNations are coming to grips with their growing over dependence on wind and solar energy .\nConcerns about not meeting electricity needs this winter are resulting in a near term reliance on coal in Europe and Asia .\nAnd we ignore the environmental impacts of mining and toxic waste from solar panels and batteries , and the destruction of raptors by wind turbines and habitats by large-scale solar farms .\nOpponents of Plan A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They state that we stand to make the overall situation worse with the simplistic solution of urgently replacing fossil fuels with wind and solar , which will have a barely noticeable impact on the climate of the 21st century .\nOpponents of Plan A argue that its best to focus on keeping economies strong and making sure that everyone has access to energy .\nAnd finally , the argument is made that there are other more pressing problems than climate change that need to be addressed with the available resources .\nDoes all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the near term about climate change ?\nNo .\nBut given the problems with Plan A , we clearly need a Plan B that broadens the climate policy envelope .\nBy considering climate change as a wicked mess , climate change can be reframed as a predicament for actively reimagining human life .\nSuch a narrative can expand our imaginative capacity and animate political action while managing social losses .\nWe should work to minimize our impact on the planet , which isn \u2019 t simple for a planet with 8 billion inhabitants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and water pollution .\nFrom time immemorial , humans have adapted to climate change .\nWhether or not we manage to drastically curtail our carbon dioxide emissions in the coming decades , we need to reduce our vulnerability to extreme weather and climate events .\nHere \u2019 s a framework for how we can get to a Plan B .\nA more pragmatic approach to dealing with climate change drops the timelines and emissions targets , in favor of accelerating energy innovation .\nWhether or not we manage to drastically curtail our carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need to reduce our vulnerability to extreme weather and climate events .\nTo thrive in the 21st century , the world will need much more energy .\nOf course we prefer our energy to be clean , as well as cheap .\nTo get there , we need new technologies .\nThe most promising right now is small modular nuclear reactors .\nBut there are also exciting advances in geothermal , hydrogen and others .\nAnd the technology landscape will look different ten years from now .\nDeveloping countries don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thrive .\nWe need much more electricity , not less .\nGoing on an energy diet like we did in the 1970 \u2019 s is off the table .\nWe need more electricity to support innovation and thrivability in the 21st century .\nConsumption and growth will continue to increase throughout the 21st century .\nWe need to accept this premise , and then figure out how we can manage this growth while protecting our environment .\nIn addressing the climate change problem , we need to remind ourselves that climate isn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that climate change isn \u2019 t the only problem that the world is facing .\nThe objective should be to improve human wellbeing in the 21st century , while protecting the environment as much as we can .\nClimate-informed decision making that focuses on food , energy , water and ecosystems will support human wellbeing in the coming decades .\nSo what does a Plan B actually look like ?\nRather than top-down solutions mandated by the UN , Plan B focuses on local solutions that secure the common interest , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reimagining 21st century electricity and transportation systems , progress can be made on a number of fronts related to land use , forest management , agriculture , water resource management , waste management , among many others .\nHuman wellbeing will be improved as a result of these efforts , whether or not climate change turns out to be a huge problem and whether or not we manage to drastically reduce our emissions .\nIndividual countries and states can serve as laboratories for solutions to their local environmental problems and climate-related risks .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the environmental impact on the planet of 8 billion people .\nI have no question that human ingenuity is up to the task of better providing for the needs and wants of Earth \u2019 s human inhabitants , while supporting habitats and species diversity .\nBut this issue is the major challenge for the next millennium .\nIt is a complex challenge that extends well beyond understanding the Earth system and developing new technologies \u2013 it also includes governance and social values .\nTo make progress on this , we need to disabuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control the Earth \u2019 s climate and prevent extreme weather events .\nThe urgency of transitioning from fossil fuels to wind and solar energy under the auspices of the UN agreements has sucked all the oxygen from the room .\nThere \u2019 s no space left for imagining what our 21st century infrastructure could look like , with new technologies and greater resilience to extreme weather events , or even to deal with traditional environmental problems .\nHumans do have the ability to solve future crises of this kind .\nHowever , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much worse by oversimplifying complex environmental issues and politicizing the science , which can lead to maladaptation and poor policy choices .\nIn 50 years time , we may be looking back on the UN climate policies , and this so-called green economy , as using chemotherapy to try to cure a head cold , all the while ignoring more serious diseases .\nIn other words , the climate crisis narrative gets in the way of real solutions to our societal and environmental problems .\nClimate change is just one of many potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point made clear by the Covid-19 pandemic .\nWhy should climate change be prioritized over other threats ?\nThere \u2019 s a wide range of threats that we could face in the 21st century : solar electromagnetic storms that would take out all space-based electronics including GPS and electricity transmission lines ; future pandemics ; global financial collapse ; a mega volcanic eruption ; a cascade of mistakes that triggers a thermonuclear , biochemical or cyber war ; the rise of terrorism .\nWe can expect to be surprised by threats that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vast sums spent on attempting to prevent climate change come from the same funds that effectively hold our insurance against all threats ; hence , this focus on climate change could overall increase our vulnerability to other threats .\nThe best insurance against any and all of these threats is to try to understand them , while increasing the overall resilience of our societies .\nProsperity is the best the indicator of resilience .\nResilient societies that learn from previous threats are best prepared to be anti-fragile

to the conservation of energy , the loss of potential energy for a volume of water is sufficient to warm it by 0.2 C for each 100 m of lowering.\n\u201d The described process corresponds to isentropic

statistical flaws in a Nature paper that claimed to show ocean warming was greater than generally thought [ 1 ] .\nThat paper was subsequently retracted .\nNature tends to publish papers that use novel approaches and/or provide newsworthy results , which have not yet stood the test of time .\nGiven that background , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot problems with methods or calculations , I read Nature papers with particular care .\nHelpfully , Nature makes peer review files available , unlike most journals .\nAlthough Nature does not also make the submitted version available , unlike the EGU Open Access journals , authors are increasingly posting open-access preprints when submitting manuscripts to journals , thus revealing changes made during peer review or after acceptance .\nThis article concerns the paper \u201c Globally resolved surface temperatures since the Last Glacial Maximum \u201d by Matthew Osman et al .\n[ 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Nature in November 2021 .\nIts Abstract reads : Matthew Osman kindly sent me a copy of the paywalled paper ; the submitted version preprint is available here .\nThe significance of this topic relates both to the use of Last Glacial Maximum ( LGM ) to preindustrial global temperature change to estimate climate sensitivity , and the magnitude and causes of temperature variability since the LGM , including in particular how preindustrial global temperature compares with that in the early Holocene .\nOsman 2021 reconstructed time-series of global , spatially-resolved surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so years ago to the preindustrial late Holocene , through extending data-assimilation methods developed by its second author , Jessica Tierney , and used by her in a 2020 paper to spatially reconstruct LGM temperatures [ 3 ] ( hereafter Tierney 2020 ) .\nAlthough Tierney 2020 states that best estimates of the LGM global mean surface air temperature ( GMAT ) [ 4 ] change relative to preindustrial ranged from \u22121.7\u00b0C to \u22128.0\u00b0C , most were between \u22123.0\u00b0C and \u22126.0\u00b0C .\nFor what it is worth , in the two most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations simulated preindustrial-to-LGM GMAT change varied from \u20132.7\u00b0C to

, which was very limited in Tierney 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one each in the north and south , is non-existent in Osman 2021 .\nIt is unclear why those three proxies , which were common to the LGM and late Holocene periods , were not used in Osman 2021 .\nIn addition to their main data-assimilation reconstruction ( \u201c LGMR \u201d ) , Osman 2021 produced a proxy-only reconstruction .\nI will start by examining that .\nThey estimate local SST from proxy data , a process subject to substantial uncertainty and possible bias .\n[ 8 ] By binning these local SST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derive mean 60\u00b0S\u221260\u00b0N SST at 200 year resolution and scale this to give an estimated GMAT time series .\n[ 9 ] This well established procedure inevitably involves uncertainty and possible bias .\nHowever , unlike with the data-assimilation method , the resulting GMAT estimates are not dependent on the spatial and temporal accuracy of paleoclimate simulations by a single GCM , which may well be poor .\nFig .\n4 of their Nature paper shows the Osman 2021 proxy-only reconstruction , over 0\u201322,000 yr BP [ 10 ] in panel a and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in panel b. Helpfully , Nature makes the underlying plot data available .\nUnfortunately , there are at least two errors in panel b .\nFirst , the dotted lines connecting the time-axes of panels a and b are incorrect ; they wrongly imply that panel b covers 0\u201310,600 yr BP .\nSecondly , Fig .\n4b show a value of \u22120.46\u00b0C for 11,000 BP but no such data point exists [ 11 ] , while the Fig .\n4b plot data is shown as starting at 500 yr BP but actually starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern , the Fig .\n4a full period proxy-only reconstruction in Nature differs in shape from the version in their preprint .\nFigure 1 compares the two versions , matched at age 0 , with identical SST to GMAT scaling factor of 1.90 .\n[ 12 ] ( The actual mean scaling factor used in the preprint was much higher at 2.44 , but that was obviously inappropriate .\n[ 13 ] ) The Nature version shows a larger temperature change between the LGM and the early Holocene , and less pronounced short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dip between 12,000 and 13,000 yr BP is much smaller , and the temperature decline between 5,000 and 1,000 yr BP is much more even .\nThis may indicate added smoothing , but that can \u2019 t be the whole explanation .\nIt is unclear from the Methods descriptions in the preprint and Nature versions of the paper why their proxy-only reconstructions differ .\n[ 14 ] I wrote to Matthew Osman asking about this but received no reply .\nIt seems surprising that the authors changed their proxy-only reconstruction without making any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their peer review responses .\nIn the absence of a satisfactory justification for these differences , I give more credence to the preprint proxy-only reconstruction .\nAs the two versions of Osman 2021 Fig .\n4a show , that matches a scaled version of the well-established Shakun-Marcott Curve ( SMC ) reconstruction considerably more closely between 14,000 and 1,000 yr BP than does the Nature version .\nWhen applying the 1.90 mean 60\u00b0S\u221260\u00b0N SST scaling factor , as per the Nature paper , to the preprint proxy-only reconstruction , the mean GMAT over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago ( commonly used to represent the LGM ) is 5.0\u00b0C cooler than that over the last 600 years , which appears to be a suitable measure of preindustrial GMAT [ 15 ] .\nHowever , the 1.90 scaling factor appears excessive .\nIt reflects the mean ratio of GSAT to 60\u00b0S\u221260\u00b0N SST in PMIP2 and PMIP3 GCM simulations of the LGM .\n[ 16 ] PMIP2 simulations are very dated .\nThe corresponding mean from PMIP3 simulations alone was 1.84 .\n[ 17 ] Moreover , published results from the more recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more advanced models with updated estimates of ice sheet configurations and other boundary conditions , show a mean ratio of GSAT to 60\u00b0S\u221260\u00b0N ocean surface air temperature of 1.64 , 6 % lower than that for PMIP3 .\n[ 18 ] That points to reducing the PMIP3 derived 1.84 ratio of GSAT to 60\u00b0S\u221260\u00b0N SST to 1.73 .\nApplying that PMIP4 ratio to the Osman 2021 preprint proxy-only reconstruction would reduce the preindustrial to LGM GSAT change to \u22124.6\u00b0C , as compared with \u22124.85\u00b0C using the PMIP3 ratio of 1.84 .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial uncertainty .\nIn GCMs , ocean surface air temperature changes more than SST , however the best estimate per the IPCC AR6 report is that changes in SST and in ocean surface air temperature are the same [ 19 ] .\nOn that basis , the PMIP4 derived scaling ratio of 1.64 from 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N ocean surface air temperature to GMAT changes can be applied directly to SST changes .\nApplying that ratio to the Osman 2021 preprint proxy-only reconstruction would reduce the preindustrial to LGM GSAT change to \u22124.3\u00b0C .\nThe data-assimilation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simulating the global climate at suitable dates using a GCM and then modifying the simulation values at each spatial grid location , statistically interpolated to each 200 year reconstruction time step period [ 20 ] , by reference to the difference between all proxy values relevant to that time step and the interpolated simulation values at the proxy locations .\nTheir method implements a \u2018 Kalman filter \u2019 update .\nThe extent of the modification made at each grid point depends on the covariance across an ensemble of \u2018 model priors \u2019 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time slices , of temperatures at that grid-point with those at all sites where proxy values at or close to the same date exist .\nIt also depends , inversely , on sum of the covariance of the simulated values and scaled-down uncertainty in the proxy values .\nUnfortunately , Osman 2021 does not show the ensemble-mean model prior , nor the difference between it and the LGMR reconstruction , either as a global mean time series or as a map at the LGM .\nIt is therefore not possible to tell to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modified in producing the reconstruction .\n[ 21 ] As well as , like the proxy-only reconstruction , depending on the accuracy of the proxy-derived local SST estimates , the accuracy of the LGMR data-assimilation reconstruction therefore depends critically on the realism of the GCM simulations used and of the spatial covariance structure that they produce .\nThe covariances used appear to be applicable to multidecadal internal variability in the GCM used , and may be different to those applicable to longer term forced climate change .\n[ 22 ] Data assimilation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence is abundant and reasonably accurate , with modest uncertainty , and where in addition the model simulations used are known to represent spatiotemporal changes and their covariance reasonably well .\nIn such cases the reconstruction should be dominantly determined by information from the observations .\nHowever , none of those conditions are satisfied at the LGM .\nWhen observational evidence is limited and highly uncertain and/or model covariances are low , a data assimilation reconstruction will largely represent model simulation values .\nIt is therefore relevant to note that the model used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] , has a particularly high preindustrial to LGM change in GMAT .\nThe main , CESM1.2 , PMIP4 model cooled by 6.8\u00b0C , over 2\u00b0C more than the PMIP4 average .\nIt is moreover not entirely clear that the iCESM1.2 model used had been adequately equilibrated before the simulations were carried out : the two preindustrial simulation ensembles listed in Extended Data Table1 had mean GMSTs with ranges that were narrow ( 14.03\u201314.25\u00b0C and 13.22\u201313.33\u00b0C ) but differed by almost 1\u00b0C [ 24 ] .\nThe Osman 2021 preprint Extended Data Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconstruction \u2019 s dependence on the model-simulation prior .\nIt shows that in many cases best-estimate LGMR GMAT changes exceed those per both the model simulation prior and the proxy-only reconstruction , even before correcting the erroneously high 2.44 60\u00b0S\u221260\u00b0N SST to GMAT scaling factor used for the preprint proxy-only reconstruction .\nSince that scaling factor is far lower in the iCESM1.2 model used , larger LGMR changes than for either the model prior or the proxy-only reconstruction suggest strong dependence of the LGMR GMAT on model-simulated SST changes at the proxy locations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latitude involved ( so that proxy changes are larger than those per the model simulation at the same location ) .\nHowever , no evidence is provided as to why that would be the case .\nWorryingly , the LGMR results presented in Nature differ from those in the preprint , with cooling at the onset of deglaciation 0.2\u00b0C greater in the Nature version .\nMoreover , the spatial cooling between 9 kyr and 2 kyr shown in the two Osman 2021 Figure 2 versions differs substantially .\nI could not spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of changes being made .\nIt is impossible to properly verify the spatiotemporal accuracy of the model simulations used , however Osman 2021 do carry out some , albeit limited , validation tests of their LGMR reconstruction .\nTheir \u2018 external validation \u2019 consists of comparing the LGMR ( posterior ) \u0394\u03b418O values , and also the model simulation ( prior ) values , at the proxy locations , with independent ice core and cave speleothem proxy record data .\nThis is similar to the validation test undertaken by Tierney 2020 .\nOsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates that LGMR substantially improves over the model prior , with the 62 % of the variance in the independent records explained by LGMR against 37 % by the model prior ( simulation values ) .\nThat is , the R2 improves from 0.37 to 0.62 , as shown in Figure 2 .\nThis is the final , Nature , version .\nOddly , it is not identical to the preprint version , without any mention in the peer review file of any changes being made .\nFig 2 .\nReproduction of Osman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i ) & ( j ) .\nTriangles represent ice core values and circles represent cave speleothem values , relative to preindustrial , for each Differencing period ( simulation time slice ) .\n\u2018 Prior \u2019 refers to the model simulation values .\n\u2018 Posterior \u2019 refers to LGMR reconstruction values .\nHowever , \u0394\u03b418O values for different differencing periods are not independent , since changes from preindustrial to any time slice except the final , 3 kyr BP , period will include changes since later time slices .\nAn even more serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cave speleothem proxies when estimating the explained variance will artificially increase the proportion of variance explained , since they/their locations evidently have very different sensitivities to temperature changes between preindustrial and the LGM .\n[ 25 ] Osman 2021 \u2019 s claimed model prior R2 of 0.37 , and higher LGMR posterior R2 of 0.62 , are spurious , misleading figures .\nA fairer test would be to consider changes only over the longest differencing period , that between preindustrial and 21 kyr BP [ 26 ] , and to analyse the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To clarify the data concerned , Figure 3 shows 21 kyr BP minus preindustrial differences for the model simulations ( Prior : blue symbols ) and the LGMR reconstruction ( Posterior : red symbols ) , plotted against the co-located proxy ( Observed ) values .\nFig 3 .\nIce core values ( triangles ) and cave speleothem values ( circles ) for the 21 kyr differencing period , digitized from Osman 2021Extended Data Fig .\n3 ( i ) & ( j ) .\nBlue symbols show model simulation ( Prior ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Posterior ) values .\nObserved values are in both cases shown along the x-axis .\nThe blue and red lines show the best fit for Observed values when predicted by ( regressed on ) respectively the model Prior and the LGMR reconstruction Posterior values .\nThe black lines join Prior and Posterior points with the same ordering of Observed ( x ) digitized values in Extended Data Fig .\n3 ( i ) and Fig .\n3 ( j ) respectively .\nFor the ice core records , the ordered Observed ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n3 ( i ) ( Prior ) and Fig .\n3 ( j ) ( Posterior ) are all identical within digitization error ( max 0.05\u2030 ) , with the black lines joining the Prior and Posterior y-values being vertical , as should be the case .\nThe data-assimilation method changes the model simulation values , but it can not change the observed proxy values .\nThe best fit when predicting observed values from the model prior ice core values ( blue line ) explains a negligible proportion of variance ( R2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nThe best fit when predicting observed values from the LGMR posterior ice core values ( red line ) is better , but it is not statistically significant ( p > 0.05 ) and it only explains a minority of the variance ( R2 = 0.32 ; adjusted R2 = 0.25 ) .\nMoreover , the slopes of the best fits are in both cases far from a 1-to-1 relationship through the origin ( green dashed line ) , albeit less so for the LGMR posterior .\nA large majority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LGMR posterior values , show larger changes than the observed values .\nThe mean observed \u0394\u03b418O value is \u22125.4\u2030 , while the model prior mean is a third larger at \u22127.2\u2030 and the LGMR posterior mean is almost as large at 7.0\u2030 .\nThus , both the model prior and the LGMR posterior substantially overestimate mean LGM cooling at the ice core locations , by respectively 33 % and 31 % [ 27 ] .\nInterestingly , if the \u22126.8\u00b0C preindustrial to LGM change in GMAT per the LGMR posterior were scaled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite close to the change implied by the proxy-only reconstruction .\nObserved cave speleothem values have a negligible correlation with either prior or posterior values ( R2 < 0.001 ) .\nThat provides no support for the validity of either the model simulations or the LGMR reconstruction .\nMoreover , a majority of the ordered cave speleothem proxy record values in Extended Data Fig .\n3 ( j ) do not match those in Fig .\n3 ( i ) within 0.1\u2030 , double the digitization error , as shown by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertical in some cases .\nThe most negative Observed cave speleothem ( leftmost dark blue circle in each of panels ( i ) and ( j ) of the original figure ) values are glaringly different : \u22125.65\u2030 and \u22126.15\u2030 : a discrepancy of 0.5\u2030 , ten times digitization error .\nThis can not possibly be correct .\nSomething has evidently gone seriously wrong here , and a correction by Osman and co-authors appears to be required .\nOsman 2021 also show results for what they call \u2018 internal validation testing \u2019 using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ randomly withheld at each time step .\nHowever , this appears to be a weak test ; most of their proxies have nearby other proxies .\nMoreover , as they say , the U-shaped ( rather than flat ) rank histogram indicates a lack of structural variance in the model prior .\nTierney 2020 carried out a similar analysis , but did not claim that the results validated their LGM reconstruction .\nIndeed , Osman 2021 seemingly admit as much in a response to a reviewer , writing \u201c our contention that LGMR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on any particular metric of prior vs. posterior ensemble spread , but rather our external validation tests \u201d .\nI do not consider Osman 2021 \u2019 s main LGMR , data-assimilation reconstruction , which estimates 6.8\u00b0C mean LGM cooling , to be reliable .\nIt is highly dependent on the spatiotemporal accuracy of LGM simulations by a single GCM .\nThe external validation tests , when analysed properly , show no significant skill by either the model simulation prior or the LGMR posterior in predicting observed LGM changes in independent cave speleothem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that both the model prior and the LGMR posterior substantially overestimate observed LGM changes per independent ice core records .\nWhile the LGMR reconstruction is innovative , I am doubtful that the accuracy of model simulations and the spatial coverage and accuracy of proxy data over the period extending back to the LGM are adequate for a data-assimilation approach to give unbiased GMAT estimates .\nIn my view , the method employed by Annan and Hargreaves ( 2013 ) [ 28 ] , which scales model-simulation cooling patterns to best match proxy data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooling in their case ) , is more suitable .\nIn my view , Osman 2021 \u2019 s preprint proxy-only reconstruction appears credible , although a lower SST multiplier than they used is appropriate .\nI consider it to be more credible than the version of their proxy-only reconstruction published in Nature , as no explanation was given for that being different from the reconstruction in their preprint , and it matches the shape of the de facto preexisting standard SMC reconstruction time series less well than the preprint version .\nUsing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most recent , PMIP4 models , estimated average LGM GMAT was ~4.6\u00b0C cooler than preindustrial per the preprint proxy-only reconstruction .\nIf , unlike in GCMs , SST actually changes as much as marine air temperature , as assessed by the IPCC in AR6 , then the implied GMAT cooling would instead be ~4.3\u00b0C .\nSince writing this article a new Holocene study , Thompson et al .\n( 2022 ) , has been published in Science Advances ( open access ) .\nUsing the same GCM as Osman 2021 , it shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mid-latitudes ( partial at 3 kyr BP ) and ( except at 3 kyr BP ) in the Arctic , to match pollen records substantially increases simulated GMAT at 3 , 6 and 9 kyr BP .\nThe difference at 6 kyr BP is 0.72\u00b0C , with the resulting GMAT being well above the preindustrial level .\nOsman 2021 \u2019 s simulations incorporated this greening only partially .\n[ 29 ] Even with all these regions greened , the model simulation ( prior ) 6 kyr BP GMAT was still well below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThese facts suggest that Osman 2021 \u2019 s model prior may be particularly unsatisfactory , spatially as well in the global mean , during the Holocene .\n[ 1 ] L.

simulations with a GMAT exceeding 5.3\u00b0C , three are by a variants of HadCM3 , an old model that dates back three climate model generations , and one is by the base-version model ( CESM1-2 ) of that used by Osman 2021 , for which it was subsequently found that the simulated LGM climate is very sensitive to treatments of cloud microphysical processes .\n[ 6 ] They also estimate cooling of 7.0\u00b0C at the point of deglaciation onset , but it is standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of several thousand years .\nMoreover , their only GCM simulations circa the LGM were at 18,000 and 21,000 yr BP [ 7 ] Taking the uncertainty distributions to be normal , the distribution of their difference has only a little over 5 % of its probability in the region where the two estimates are compatible .\n[ 8 ] The estimated relationship between proxy data and local SST together with other relevant climate variables is reflected in \u2018 forward models \u2019 of proxy values .\nSST estimates can then be derived using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other climate variables involved , via Bayesian \u2018 inverse models \u2019 .\nSST estimates therefore depend on the forward models , on the related Bayesian inverse models , and on the ancillary climate variable estimates used in addition to the SST proxy data .\nMuch of the resulting uncertainty is unavoidable , however the use of Bayesian inverse models introduces a further source of uncertainty and possible bias , in addition to that ( including as to age calibration ) arising directly from the nature of the proxies .\n[ 9 ] The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in the final Nature paper was 1.90 , a mean value originally derived from PMIP2 and PMIP3 simulation data .\n[ 11 ] The 200-yr resolution reconstruction values are all at odd multiples of 100 years BP .\n[ 12 ] The plotted lines are accurately digitized copies , with the preprint version rescaled from 2.44 to 1.90 times mean 60\u00b0S\u221260\u00b0N SST to GMAT to match the 1.90 scaling in the Nature version .\nThe preprint line has also been shifted by \u22120.25\u00b0C to rebase it to match the Nature version ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the last 4,000 , rather than 1,000 , years proxy values ) .\nNote that the Fig .\n4a version in Nature appears to have been stretched slightly in the time dimension and shifted it by 100 years , relative to the published data .\nThe preprint version very likely did the same , since its turning points coincide with those in the Nature version .\n[ 13 ] The 2.44 mean scaling factor was taken from a study involving a proxy-derived estimate of the change in mean

derived from core-top values , with instrumental reconstruction values being used instead .\nIt is not obvious why that should lead to a larger LGM to preindustrial temperature change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible since SST estimates from the affected proxies might generally be negatively biased and/or the .instrumental reconstruction values might have positive biases .\n[ 15 ] This is after increasing

likely of interest to those interested in the subject These notes are a continuation of the discussions initiated in this previous post at CE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description of viscous heat dissipation of kinetic energy into thermal energy .\nIn the previous notes I identified the textbook by Bird , Stewart , and Lightfoot [ 1960 ] as a valid source for such information .\nThe exact same description appears in a multitude of other textbooks .\nBecause the physical phenomenon is of a foundational nature , its description is generally not open to questions and debate about the year of publication .\nThe material in the textbooks is a summary of the development given by Bird [ 1957 ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local-instantaneous equation for balance of kinetic energy to develop a macroscopic formulation of that equation and the generalized mechanical energy balance equation .\nThe latter is a method of including losses due to viscosity into the Bernoulli equation .\nBird \u2019 s approach seems to be very appropriate because viscous dissipation of kinetic energy involves both kinetic energy and viscosity .\nI have looked into development of the formulations for viscous heat dissipation as used in the glaciology literature a little ways back into past time .\nMy review is very limited ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the 19th century .\nViscous heat dissipation could be considered important because the increased fluid temperature associated with the phenomenon has a potential to cause melting of ice in glaciers beyond what would occur if the process did not exist .\nAdditional melting could potentially affect the amount of meltwater that enters the Oceans , and also could provide lubrication for motion of glaciers by way of liquid films between the bottom of the glacier and the solid materials over which they slide .\nBoth issues have been research subjects .\nHowever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications given the complexity of the application domains .\nIn several aspects , the exact topology of glaciers , both interior too and the bounding surfaces of , can not be known .\nSome research uses a sensitivity approach directed toward heat transfer , by changing the initial fluid temperature , for example , or direct variation of the heat transfer coefficient , or assuming that the ice and meltwater are at the melting temperature of the ice at the local pressure .\nIn the latter approach , any additional energy in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes 100 % into melting .\nFocused Validation on each potential uncertain aspect is very likely beyond what can be accomplished in the complex physical domain of the applications .\nPresently , Validation relies on use of integrated functional responses and these can not ensure causality between any one uncertain parameter and the response function of interest .\nIn a comment at a previous post , I mentioned that Mayaud [ 2012 ] in Equation 7 reports the exact formulation for conversion of turbulent kinetic energy into thermal energy that is given in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fluid mechanics , and engineering fluid flow .\nMayaud did not cite a source for the term .\nAfter that , I ran across Macdonald [ 2013 ] in which Equation 3.9

the form of a regression slope coefficient .\n\u2022 The larger the coefficient associated with GHGs , the bigger the implied effect on the climate system .\n\u2022 In 2003 Myles Allen and Simon Tett

Climate Dynamics paper by Myles Allen and Simon Tett .\nWith some modifications it has been widely used by climate scientists ever since .\nLast year I published a paper in Climate Dynamics showing that the basis for believing the method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis website provides links to my paper , as well as to the Allen and Tett ( 1999 ) paper I critiqued , a non-technical summary of my argument , Myles Allen \u2019 s reply and my response , and a comment by Richard Tol .\nOne of the arguments Allen made in response was that the issue is now moot because the method he co-authored has been replaced by newer ones ( emphasis added ) : The original framework of AT99 was superseded by the Total Least Squares approach of Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in turn has been largely superseded by the regularised regression or likelihood-maximising approaches , developed entirely independently .\nTo be a little light-hearted , it feels a bit like someone suggesting we should all stop driving because a new issue has been identified with the Model-T Ford .\nHa ha , Model T Ford ; we all drive Teslas now , aka Total Least Squares .\nBut in 20 years of usage did any climate scientists check if TLS actually solves the problem ?\nA few statisticians looked at it over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TLS .\nBut once it was adopted by climatologists that was that ; with few exceptions no one asked any questions .\nI have just published a new paper in Climate Dynamics critiquing the use of TLS in fingerprinting applications .\nTLS was intended to correct a potential downward bias in OLS coefficient estimates which could understate the influence of GHG \u2019 s on the climate .\nWhile there is a legitimate argument that OLS can be biased downward , the problem is that in typical usage TLS is biased upwards , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GHGs .\nThere is a special case in which TLS gives unbiased results , but a user can not know if a data set matches those conditions .\nMoreover , TLS is specifically unsuitable for testing the null hypothesis in signal detection and its results ought to be confirmed using OLS .\nThe Errors-in-Variables Problem and the Weakness of TLS OLS models assume that the explanatory variables in a regression are accurately measured , so the \u201c errors \u201d separating the dependent variable from the regression line are entirely due to randomness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variables also contain randomness , for instance due to measurement error , OLS will typically yield biased slope estimators .\nIn a simple model with one explanatory ( x ) variable and one dependent ( y ) variable the bias will be downward , which is called \u201c attenuation bias.\n\u201d David Giles has a nice explanation of the problem here , and you can also look at econometrics texts like Wooldridge or Davidson and MacKinnon .\nThe measurement problem is referred to as errors-in-variables or EIV .\nSince climate models yield noisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c signals \u201d Allen and Stott ( 2003 ) suggested the TLS method as a remedy .\nThis is not how econometrics deals with the issue .\nIn every econometrics textbook of which I am aware , the recommended treatment for EIV is Instrumental Variables estimation , which can be shown to yield unbiased and consistent coefficient estimates .\nI have never seen TLS covered in any econometrics textbook , ever .\nNor have I ever seen it used in economics , or anywhere else outside of climatology except in the small literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , primarily a 1987 book by Wayne Fuller , a 1981 article in the Annals of Statistics by Leon Gleser and a 1996 article in The American Statistician by RJ Carroll and David Ruppert .\nBoth Fuller and Gleser discuss the difficulty of proving that TLS ( or orthogonal regression as it is more commonly called ) yields unbiased and consistent estimates .\nThe problem , as explained by Carroll and Ruppert , is that the method requires estimating more parameters than there are \u201c sufficient statistics \u201d in the data : or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the data can identify .\nImplementation of TLS therefore requires arbitrarily choosing the value of one of the parameters .\nBoth y and x have error terms with variances needing to be estimated , and the assumption in practise is that they are equal , so only one needs to be estimated .\nIf they happen to be equal , Gleser shows that the TLS estimate is consistent ( meaning any bias goes to zero as the sample goes to infinity ) .\nIf not , consistency can not be guaranteed .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless model-generated signals contain random errors with exactly the same variance as the random errors in the observed climate ( or if they can be rescaled to make them equal ) , TLS can not be shown to yield unbiased slope coefficients .\nCarroll and Ruppert also point out that TLS depends on the assumption that the regression model itself is correctly specified , in other words the regression model includes everything that explains variations in the dependent variable .\nOLS assumes this as well , but it is more robust to model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more variables but they are uncorrelated with the included variables then OLS coefficients will not be biased , but if any of the omitted variables are correlated with the included variable OLS will be biased up or down depending on the sign of the correlation .\nWith TLS , bias arises either way , whether the omitted variable is correlated with the included variables or not , but the bias is always upwards .\nUnless you happen to have a regression model that fully explains the dependent variable , so that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would lie exactly on the regression line , the default assumption should be that TLS overestimates the parameter values .\nThus TLS can , in principle , yield unbiased signal detection coefficients , but only if the climate model that generates the signals includes everything that explains the observed climate , and adds random noise to the signals with precisely the same variance as the randomness in the observed climate .\nOf course , if those claims were true we wouldn \u2019 t need to do signal detection regressions in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GHG \u2019 s influence the climate , we could just look inside the model .\nSignal detection regressions are motivated by the fact that climate models are neither perfect nor complete , yet the claim that the results are unbiased presumes that they are both .\nTo investigate how these issues affect signal detection regressions I ran simulated regressions as follows .\nImagine a sample of surface temperature trends ( y ) from a sample of 200 locations stretching from the North Pole to the South Pole .\nI constructed two uncorrelated explanatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thought of as 200 simulated trends ( or \u201c signals \u201d ) for those locations from a model forced with anthropogenic greenhouse gases and X2 comes from a model with only natural forcings .\nThen I added some random noise to the X \u2019 s yielding the random variables W1 and W2 .\nSince every regression model potentially omits at least one relevant explanatory variable I also generated two additional variables Q1 and Q2 .\nQ1 is just an uncorrelated set of random numbers .\nQ2 is a set of random numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generated 9 versions of the dependent variable y : Y1 = bX1 + X2/2 + v where b was set equal to 0.0 , 0.5 or 1.0 and v is white noise ; and in each of the latter two b was again allowed to be 0.0 , 0.5 or 1.0 .\nI regressed each version of y on W1 and W2 : Each time I estimated the coefficients b1 and b2 using both OLS and TLS .\nBy construction b2 should always equal 0.5 and I didn \u2019 t focus on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which should equal 0.0 , 0.5 or 1.0 depending on the simulation .\nThe important thing to bear in mind is that a researcher doesn \u2019 t know which dependent variable he or she has used .\nIf we assume it \u2019 s Y1 then we are assuming the regression model is correctly specified , the only problem is W1 is a noisy version of X1 .\nIf we used YQ1 that means we assume the regression model omits an uncorrelated explanatory variable and if we assume we used YQ2 that means the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere is no reason to assume we only ever use Y1 in practice : wouldn \u2019 t that be nice .\nI ran these 20,000 times each and looked at the distributions of b1 under OLS and TLS .\nI then added a couple of other wrinkles .\nFirst I reduced the variance on the noise term on the X \u2019 s , which is analogous to improving the signal-noise ratio in X. I also ran a version in which the X \u2019 s are slightly negatively correlated , to correspond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anthropogenic and natural signals are negatively correlated .\nThe working assumption in the signal detection field is that the OLS estimates of b1 are biased low but the TLS estimates are unbiased .\nIn the first set of results the distributions of b1 were as follows .\nOLS is in blue and TLS is in red .\nA solid line means the dependent variable was Y1 , a dashed line means it was YQ1 and a dotted line means it was YQ2 .\nLooking at the OLS results , attenuation bias is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b is zero OLS is unbiased .\nIt remains unbiased if the model omits an independent explanatory variable but if the omitted variable is correlated with X1 ( dashed line ) the OLS estimate is biased upward .\nAs the true value of b rises the OLS estimate becomes centered below the true value .\nIn the bottom panel , dotted line , the attenuation bias and the omitted variable bias roughly cancel each other out ( dotted line ) but this is just a fluke , not a general rule .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the distribution is much wider because TLS is less efficient .\nWhen the true value of b is zero and there are no omitted variables the distribution is centered on zero .\nAs the true value of b goes up , all three versions of the TLS regression yield positively-biased estimates .\nPositive bias matters not only because of the risk of false positives but because the coefficient magnitude itself feeds into \u201c carbon budget \u201d calculations .\nThe higher the coefficient value the smaller the \u201c allowable \u201d carbon budget when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crosses a certain climate target .\nThese are important calculations with very large global macroeconomic consequences so I find it disconcerting that the problem of positive bias in TLS-based fingerprinting regression results hasn \u2019 t been examined before .\nFor the next batch of estimates I reduced the variance of the noise on the X \u2019 s , which I call the high SNRx case .\nNow OLS moves towards the true value when there is no correlated omitted variable , which makes sense because as the noise on X goes to zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to be unbiased .\nBut TLS does not have the same tendency , indeed the positive bias gets slightly worse in the omitted variables case .\nThis is not a good property of an estimator : as an important noise component shrinks you \u2019 d expect it to converge on the true value .\nNext I looked at the case when the noise on the X \u2019 s and on y is the same magnitude , which is the optimal configuration for TLS because the assumed variance ratio in the computation algorithm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf the regression model is correctly specified TLS is unbiased .\nBut if a variable is omitted , even an uncorrelated one , and the true value of beta is > 0 , TLS has an upward bias .\nOLS has a downward bias except when Q2 is missing , then its net bias is upward .\nI examined numerous other configurations of the simulation model and discussed the question of which estimator should be preferred .\nThe differences in results do not reflect methodological choices , they reflect different assumptions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the researcher has no idea which one best describes the data set at hand , OLS is more often a preferred option than TLS , notwithstanding its known biases .\nYes OLS sometimes yields a coefficient biased towards zero , but it is a known bias .\nTLS will typically yield a coefficient with a positive bias , and the size of the bias is difficult to predict in part because of the large variance .\nInterestingly , as the true value of b goes to zero , the estimator preference unambiguously goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to zero and the TLS estimator becomes undefined .\nThis means that if we are testing the null hypothesis that b=0 , in other words greenhouse forcing does not explain observed climate changes , we shouldn \u2019 t rely on TLS since if the null is true we wouldn \u2019 t use TLS , we would use OLS .\nOr , put another way , if a significant signal detection result depends on using TLS rather than OLS , it is not a robust result .\nI have another study under review in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences of allowing the X \u2019 s to be correlated with each other .\nI included a preliminary look at this case in the present paper .\nI found that when the signals are correlated OLS still exhibits attenuation bias even when the true value of b = 0 and TLS exhibits a positive bias , but in this case the TLS bias gets large enough to risk false positives : namely an apparently \u201c significant \u201d value of b even when the true value is zero .\nIn sum I conclude that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thereby yielding signal

conditions over one to three months can enable farmers to make more informed decisions about how much to invest or which crops to grow , while shorter-range products can be used to determine the best

evaluation of weather forecasts \u2019 effects on agricultural outcomes that we hope to implement in 2023 .\nSome of the questions we will explore during this preliminary phase include : \u2022 To what extent do farmers update their subjective weather expectations in response to different forecasts ?\nWhat role do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barriers play ?\n\u2022 How do farmers interpret probabilistic weather information ?\nDo forecasts with a numeric probability of a weather event and a qualitative likelihood of the same event affect their beliefs differently ?\n\u2022 For which agricultural

evaluation will have policy implications at PxD and beyond .\nFor example , improved understanding of the returns to information products that reduce agricultural risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new services , such as pest prediction models .\nThe project will also seek to provide policymakers with evidence and incentives to increase funding to improve forecasts in regions that are under-served by

decisions relating to the timing of agronomist-identified , weather-dependent coffee activities : fertilizer and lime application , coffee pruning , shade regulation , and harvesting .\nWe hope to identify how weather fits into these decisions and what other factors influence the timing of these activities .\nIf other limiting factors ( such as the availability of an input ) impact timing to a

cotton and wheat farmers .\nWhile 71 % of wheat farmers cited access to weather forecasting information , only 45 % of cotton farmers surveyed reported access to weather information .\nWhen asked if weather information \u201c helped in planning \u201d , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat respondents respectively responded in the affirmative .\nFarmer users were asked to \u201c Please list the types of weather challenges you have experienced \u201d in the three years prior to being surveyed .\nForty-three percent of respondents who reported experiencing weather-related challenges cited heavy rainfall and 30 % reported high winds .\nThese types of weather incidents can be very costly for smallholder farmers with limited resources .\nInundation washes away expensive inputs , creates mud that blocks sprouting crops , and creates conditions conducive to disease , while wind can destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle .\nFurther , when prompted to answer \u201c Out of these weather challenges , which three have the largest impact on your crop costs and yields \u201d , pest management was reported as the most common answer .\nMany pests and diseases thrive in particular weather conditions and can proliferate quickly if conditions are optimal .\nThis suggests that a combination of advisory and weather forecasting information alerting farmers to be on the lookout for pests and to initiate pesticide application decisions sooner could be valuable as a means for reducing pest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this product is the quality of the weather forecasts themselves .\nThe existing forecast services in Punjab tend not to be designed with the end user \u2019 s needs in mind .\nThree services in Punjab , Pakistan exemplify usability issues : the first requires user-initiated , user-paid inbound calls ; the second requires internet access ; and the third is only available to subscribers of a particular telecoms company .\nLearnings from these research activities , coupled with insights generated by our collaboration with CFAN , will inform the final design of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers .\nOnce this product is up and running , the focus will shift to impact evaluation , including pick-up rates , behavior changes , and forecast accuracy .\nPending a review of such impact outcomes , and funding considerations , the product will be further developed to cover the Rabi season and potentially scaled to additional countries .\nThis Kharif season , we are thrilled at the prospect of hundreds of thousands of Punjabi smallholder cotton farmers witnessing less fertilizer \u2013 and by implication , fewer resources \u2013 washed away or harvests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective irrigation tailored to the forecast , and incurring fewer crop losses due to heavy rains and winds .\nWhen we asked our PxD Pakistan agronomist about the potential impact of this product , she said : \u201c This product will reduce farming risks and expenses , and increase what is usually a farmer \u2019 s sole source of income \u2013 allowing for more investment into farming or money for personal expenses \u201d .\nCFAN is providing a comprehensive range of forecast variables , including temperature , wind , soil moisture , humidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the single most important forecast variable is precipitation .\nCFAN is using 15 day ensemble forecasts from both ECMWF and NOAA ( GEFS ) .\nCFAN \u2019 provides probabilistic weather forecasts based on the forecast ensemble ( e.g .\n51 ensemble members from ECMWF for each forecast ) .\nThe ensemble forecasts are transformed into meaningful probabilities through calibration of the forecasts by eliminating biases and distributional errors in the ensemble forecast ( see schematic below ) Forecast calibration requires good observational data .\nParticularly in Pakistan , there is very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainfall , we elected to use the satellite-based IMERG precipitation data , which does the best with extreme rainfall events .\nWhile the ECMWF forecast system does quite well , our calibrations significantly increase forecast skill .\nCFAN provides a deterministic \u2018 best guess \u2019 forecast Below are two forecasts

improvement to the skill relative to the native ECMWF forecasts ( black ) , especially for shorter lead times .\nThe skill score used is the ROC , which is explained below Our clients have also requested that we provide seasonal forecasts of monsoon rainfall .\nThese forecasts help guide decisions on which crop varietals to plant , and how much to plant .\nCFAN is using @ @ @ @ @ @ @

there came speculation that changes in sunspot number and changes in weather were related , as Theophrastus suggested in 325 BC .\nItalian Jesuit astronomer Giambattista Riccioli and Mexican astronomer Jos\u00e9 Antonio Alzate made the same suggestion in 1651 and 1784 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , astronomer , and the best telescope builder of his time , the discoverer of Uranus and infrared radiation , William Herschel was the first to propose that the sun was a variable star and sunspots reflected changes in solar activity that had an effect on climate .\nIn an article presented in 1801 at the Royal Society he said : \u201c I am now much inclined to believe that \u2026 [ abundant sunspots ] , may lead us to expect a copious emission of heat , and therefore mild seasons .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of \u2026 [ sunspots ] , will denote a spare emission of heat , may induce us to expect severe seasons \u201d ( Herschel 1801 ) .\nIt is interesting that Herschel was also the first to correctly relate more sunspots to higher solar emissions , unlike all previous observers and nearly all that followed him until the 20th century .\nHe then proceeded to relate the price of wheat since 1650 , obtained from Adam Smith \u2019 s The Wealth of Nations , to early sunspot accounts , finding a correspondence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely incorrect .\nHe himself warned that the criterion was probably not real since the price of commodities is also regulated by their demand , but the lack of temperature records left him with no other method .\nFigure 1.2 shows that grain production is a better choice , as it would be expected .\nThe great mortality from the 1317 famine and the Black Death from 1346 that killed one third of the European population resulted in decreased demand that

cycle , except they took place during the Dalton Minimum .\nThat discovery had to await Heinrich Schwabe who was looking for a hypothetical planet inside the orbit of Mercury , called Vulcan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFor 17 years ( only one and half periods ! )\nhe made detailed solar observations trying to distinguish a transit of Vulcan among the sunspots .\nHe was publishing his solar observations every year , and in 1843 he reported : \u201c From my earlier observations , which I have reported every year in this journal , it appears that there is a certain periodicity in the appearance of sunspots and this theory seems more and more probable from the results of this year .\n\u2026 If one compares the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when no spots are visible , one will find that sunspots have a period of about 10 years , and that for five years of this period they appear so frequently that during that time there are very few or no days when no spots at all are visible \u201d ( Schwabe 1843 ) .\nSchwabe \u2019 s idea attracted little attention until the inclusion of his sunspot data in Alexander von Humboldt \u2019 s 1851 monumental work Kosmos .\nThen four astronomers , including Rudolf Wolf , director of the Bern observatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small daily fluctuations in the geomagnetic field corresponded in period and epoch , with the sunspot cycle described by Schwabe .\nRudolf Wolf then began a systematic study of solar variations giving rise to the sunspot record .\nHeinrich Schwabe , despite not finding Vulcan ( it is in the 40 Eridani triple star system , according to Star Trek ) , was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1857 .\nThe discovery of the solar cycle triggered a frenzy to find 11-year periodicities in any weather record .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ published about the sun-climate connection .\nThe next decade they were more than a hundred ( Hoyt & Schatten 1997 ) , and in the following decades they continued to multiply .\nIn 1958 the American Meteorological Society listed 1278 articles on solar-weather relationships in its bibliography .\nMost of the sun-climate studies between 1870 and 1920 agreed that there was a negative correlation between sunspots and temperatures in most locations where a good correlation could be found .\nFrom this period the studies by Wladimir K\u00f6ppen stand out .\nK\u00f6ppen stablished a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made substantial contributions to several branches of science .\nHe was one of the foremost climate scientists of his time and , with his son-in-law Alfred Wegener , lent crucial support to the Milankovitch theory .\nK\u00f6ppen sun-climate studies were rigorous .\nHis 1873 article about the eleven-year period of temperature was the most comprehensive to that time and he published an update in 1914 .\nHe concluded that the sun does indeed cause a periodicity in the Earth \u2019 s surface temperature , not only in many locations but also on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time , the small changes in CO levels could not have been the cause of the climate changes detected by K\u00f6ppen .\nAt the turn of the century the consensus was that there was no doubt that the 11 and 22-year solar cycles negatively correlated with surface temperature at most locations and even hemispherically and globally , showing a positive correlation with precipitation at low and high latitudes and a negative one at mid-latitudes .\nIn 1903 Nordmann stated : \u201c The mean terrestrial temperature exhibits a period sensibly equal to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spots is to diminish the mean terrestrial temperature , that is to say , the curve which represents the variations of this is parallel to the inverse curve of the frequency of solar spots.\n\u201d ( Hoyt & Schatten 1997 ) .\n1.3 The solar constant and the subfield discredit The amount of solar energy arriving to the Earth , or total solar irradiance ( TSI ) , started to be measured with the invention of the pyrheliometer by Claude Poillet in 1837 .\nThe accuracy of the data during the 19th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the early instruments and the lack of proper standardization in the early measurements .\nDespite these shortcomings , astrophysicists of the time noticed that variations in TSI ought to be very small , giving birth to the concept of the solar constant .\nIn 1878 Samuel Langley invented the bolometer and in 1890 he became director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory .\nWith the help of Charles Abbot , who succeeded him in 1906 , they set up a program to determine solar constant variations with stations located at mountain peaks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1923 to 1954 showed small variations associated to the solar cycle of 0.02\u20130.25 % and a controversial increase of 0.2 % during the 31-year period .\nCharles Abbot was convinced of the sun-climate connection , and after the end of the program he wrote in the first issue of the now called Solar Energy Journal that : \u201c As solar radiation and the weather appear to be affected by identical periods of variation , it is therefore likely that weather changes are produced by solar variation.\n\u201d He then proceeded to compare solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis and Peoria with actual weather data from 1854 to 1939 , as evidence of his thesis ( Abbot 1957 ) .\nNevertheless , he acknowledged the difficulty of attributing significant weather changes to such small variations in the solar constant , recognizing that the general opinion was against his hypothesis .\nThe consensus of the time had changed from supporting the sun-climate connection at the beginning of the 20th century to rejecting it by mid-century .\nThe change did not happen because of a better determination of the solar constant , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variability , but by something that happened around 1920 .\nAll those statistically significant correlations that the best scientists of the time , like Wladimir K\u00f6ppen , had found in about seven decades of weather data ( c. 1840\u20131910 ) , started to fail around 1920 , or even worse they inverted , something that nobody could explain .\nThe situation became very confusing , some authors claiming positive correlation , others negative correlation , and others no correlation at all .\nElaborate hypotheses were proposed , indicating a troubled paradigm , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By 1950 the study of sun-weather relationships was considered by many to be an undignified pursuit for a meteorologist ( Hoyt & Schatten 1997 ) , and this state was recognized by Abbot in his 1957 article .\nFig .\n1.3 .\nGraph of some correlation reversals ( R ) and failures ( F ) for selected meteorological variables and sunspots .\nFrom Herman & Goldberg 1978 .\nThe timing of the sign reversal in several sun-climate correlations tended to cluster between 1920\u201330 ( Fig .\n1.3 ) .\nTemperature correlation inverted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like precipitation , winds , the preferential location of the Icelandic low , and the strength of the Indian monsoon .\nEven though the sign reversals could not be explained , they still suggested a sun-climate relationship , just not one based on TSI changes , since the relationship between solar emissions and sunspot activity does not invert .\nThis important conclusion escaped most climate researchers at the time and it escapes many of them today .\nIn the early 20th century , climate shifts were unknown , but it is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place in the Pacific from a cool Pacific Decadal Oscillation to a warm one ( Mantua & Hare 2002 ) .\nThis shift took place right after the 1923 solar minimum , and resulted in global warming ( the early 20th century warming ) , despite solar activity being below average until 1934 .\nFig .\n1.4 .\nA sun-precipitation correlation reversal c. 1800

.\n2005 .\nAccording to Hoyt and Schatten ( 1997 ) the sun-temperature correlations have changed sign several times during the past 400 years and have been negative between about 1600-1720 and 1800-1920 , and positive between about 1720-1800 and 1920 and the present .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhile the sun-climate subfield was falling into disrepute , the seeds for its renaissance were being planted .\nAndrew Douglass was an astronomer that had been fired by Percival Lowell in 1901 for his skepticism about the artificial nature of Martian canals .\nThrough his entire career Douglass was convinced of the sun-climate effect , and in 1904 he noticed a correlation between tree-ring widths in Arizona , related to precipitation conditions , and sunspots .\nBy pursuing this relationship , he developed the new subfield of dendrochronology over the following 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dating ancient structures until the advent of radiocarbon dating .\nDouglass studied the annual rings of trees in relation to climate and solar activity and was the discoverer of the centennial solar cycle ( named by him as the triple-triple solar cycle ) .\nHe did not find it in sunspot records , but in its climatic effect on sequoia ring-growth ( Douglass 2019 ) .\nIt is the only instance of a solar cycle first identified in the paleoclimate record .\nWillard Libby developed radiocarbon dating in the late 1940s .\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential to know how the atmospheric 14C/12C ratio had changed over time .\nScientists had to build a calibration curve ( IntCal ) from precisely dated tree rings by Douglass \u2019 dendrochronological method , to transform radiocarbon ratios into calendar ages .\nHans Suess in California and Minze Stuiver in Arizona were among those leading the effort .\nIn 1961 , Stuiver was the first to suggest that atmospheric 14C variations lasting a few centuries or less were due to solar modulation of cosmic ray 14C production in the upper atmosphere ( Stuiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun appeared to be more variable over long periods of time than recent solar constant measurements indicated .\nThis finding opened the door to using the recently reconstructed 14C changes to study solar variability and its relationship to climatic changes in the distant past .\nStarting in 1963 , and based on his glaciological and botanical studies , Roger Bray proposed that there was a close relation between solar activity and climate during the past centuries and millennia .\nIn 1968 he identified the solar and climate 2500-year cycle that has been recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis long solar cycle is the most important , in terms of climatic effect , during the Holocene .\nThe most recent low in Bray \u2019 s solar cycle , during 1388\u20131834 ( Bray 1968 ) , coincided with the Little Ice Age ( LIA ) discovered by Fran\u00e7ois Matthes in 1939 .\nRoger Bray first proposed that the LIA had a solar cause .\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s Roger Bray published 14 articles in Nature and Science linking solar variability and volcanic activity to climate change , but as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealand and removed from other sun-climate scientists , he was not credited for his findings unjustly .\nHis cycle was given the absurd \u201c Hallstatt \u201d name by Paul Damon and Charles Sonnet ( Damon & Sonnet 1991 ) , despite being aware of Bray \u2019 s work .\nIn 1974 Robert Currie published a study of 226 weather stations throughout the world , that in 1993 was updated using 1,200 U.S. stations .\nUsing new statistical methods just developed , he found both a 10.5 solar and an 18.9 lunar signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local effects could mask the regional signal at some stations .\nInterestingly , he detected that stations East of the Rocky Mountains displayed a positive correlation between solar activity and temperature , whereas stations West of the Rocky Mountains displayed a negative one ( Currie 1993 ) , an effect not very unlike the signal-reversal in correlation observed in the 1920s .\nIn 1980 Currie detected an 11-yr sunspot cycle signal in Earth rotation .\nHe was not the first to do so after the invention of the atomic clock , but since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( probably due to the lack of accepted mechanism ) the Sun-Earth rotation effect has been \u201c discovered \u201d independently multiple times , the last time in 2010 , and it continues to be ignored .\nHowever , the first viable mechanism for the sun-climate effect was suggested by Colin Hines in 1974 .\nA year earlier Wilcox et al .\n( 1973 ) discovered that the solar magnetic field sector structure affected the average area of low-pressure troughs during the winter in the Northern Hemisphere at an altitude of 300 mb ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHines ( 1974 ) was skeptical of any sun-climate effect but suggested that planetary waves subjected to variable reflection in the upper atmosphere , may induce variable interference patterns in the lower atmosphere .\nThese might constitute a possible candidate for the effect , if it was real .\nA widely circulated article by Joe King ( 1975 ) did much to popularize the renewed interest in sun-climate relationships by presenting a great variety of evidence and concluded that : \u201c the accumulated evidence is so compelling that it is no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections between the weather and radiation changes.\n\u201d It prepared the scene for John Eddy \u2019 s landmark article in Science a year later .\nEddy brought to light the forgotten finding by Gustav Sp\u00f6rer and Edward Maunder that during the 1645-1715 period the sun behaved in a very unusual way and displayed very few sunspots .\nEddy , very interested in the history of astronomy , supported their finding with naked-eye sunspot observations , auroral observations , eclipse observations , and 14C data ( Eddy 1976 ) .\nThe Science article on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddy followed up with several articles on the sun-climate relationship

again bursting with activity , advanced with well attended meetings , given its interdisciplinary and controversial nature , it was still criticized .\nBarrie Pittock published a critical look at 140 sun-climate articles ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite a massive literature on the subject , there is at present little or no convincing evidence of statistically significant or practically useful correlations between sunspot cycles and the weather or climate.\n\u201d 1.5 1980s Global Warming and the second sun-climate demise In the 1980s , the sun-climate renaissance of the 1960s-70s was drained of energy by improvements in solar constant measurements .\nCavity radiometers were first equipped in the Earth Radiation Budget experiment onboard Nimbus 7 satellite in November 1978 .\nThe Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor ( ACRIM ) experiment started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980 .\nFor the first time solar constant values reached the precision of two decimal places of a percent .\nThe decrease in the solar constant from the 1980 solar cycle maximum to the 1986 minimum was determined to be 0.15 % , or 2 W/m2 .\nBut the yearly change had already been determined by 1982 to be of only 0.02 % .\nThe great majority of researchers believed that only changes in total energy could affect climate , to them a change of \u00b1 0.07 % could not produce significant effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar changes could act on atmospheric instabilities that amplified their climatic effect were at odds to explain how they could do so in an inherently unstable atmosphere .\nIn 1980 Nastrom and Belmont appeared to have identified how the sun-climate effect was acting .\nUsing radiosonde data for 174 stations in the Northern Hemisphere for the period 1949-1973 they found that tropospheric winds displayed a clear solar signal .\nThey found that wind speed and temperature were responding to the solar cycle , and the effect was maximal near the tropopause during winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1983 the same authors declared their result statistically insignificant after more tests ( Venne et al .\n1983 ) .\nAlso in 1980 Minze Stuiver , the authority in radiocarbon dating that had initiated past solar activity reconstructions in 1961 , published an influential article in Nature comparing the new detailed 14C variability reconstruction and several long climate records ( Stuiver 1980 ) .\nHe concluded that low solar activity periods like the Maunder Minimum had taken place several times during the past 6,000 years and that a relationship between climatic series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity for the past millennium could not be established .\nMinze \u2019 s article demolished John Eddy \u2019 s work .\nTwo years later Eddy certified the death of sun-climate studies as mainstream science : \u201c Spacecraft measurements have established that the total radiative output of the Sun varies at the 0.1\u20130.3 % level .\n\u2026 Such changes can be expected to perturb the terrestrial surface

had been burned twice , in the 1920s and 1980s ; it should not happen again .\nThe subfield fell into absolute disrepute .\nNothing with the words \u201c solar \u201d and \u201c climate \u201d in the

and deserves a thorough investigation that is not taking place .\nFrom Vin\u00f3s 2022 .\nThe turnaround was complete for those who wished to continue their careers .\nWilcox , Svalgaard , and

seeing a clear effect .\nThat the sun-climate effect is stronger in Arctic latitudes during the winter is further confirmation of what could be deduced from the reversal of sun-weather correlations : The sun can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in TSI because there is no solar irradiation during the polar night , and it doesn \u2019 t matter there how small or large the TSI changes are for a sun that doesn \u2019 t

controversial change to the sunspot record that better supports his views .\n1.6 Karin Labitzke and the unacclaimed first solid proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Research Council published a monograph on \u201c Solar Variability , Weather , and Climate.\n\u201d It reads like a death certificate of the subfield .\nIt includes articles by James Holton and Barrie Pittock among others , under the chairmanship of John Eddy .\nJames Holton , one of the foremost experts in the atmosphere , analyzed the possible physical mechanisms for a sun-climate effect through a dynamic coupling between the stratosphere and the troposphere in a negative light ( Holton 1982 ) .\nWhen considering Hines \u2019 ( 1974 ) mechanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow related to solar variability might alter the reflection/absorption of planetary waves and through wave interference produce effects in the troposphere .\nTo him , this mechanism provided a possible link between solar variability and tropospheric weather and climate , which could be significant despite the huge energy difference between the solar input and the climate response .\nHowever , he concluded that the mechanism was speculative .\nTwo years earlier Holton and Tan ( 1980 ) had published a seminal article discovering that equatorial stratospheric winds , despite circling the Earth at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global circulation .\nThese winds are known as the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation ( QBO ) because they alternate between easterly and westerly direction with a quasi-periodicity slightly over two years .\nThe effect of the QBO on Northern Hemispheric circulation discovered by Holton and Tan was to alter the mean geopotential ( pressure ) at the pole during the winter via planetary waves .\nThis finding should have raised all kind of questions about possible solar activity involvement , since it was clearly related to the Wilcox et al .\nfindings and involved Colin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time a solar explanation was ( still is ) unacceptable to most academics .\nDuring winter , strong westerly winds circle the polar region trapping a cold-air low-pressure center , forming a strong polar vortex .\nThe north polar vortex modulation by the QBO is so important that it received the \u201c Holton-Tan effect \u201d name .\nInterestingly , the north polar geopotential modulation by the QBO was only significant during the winter season when the mean zonal wind is westerly and vertically propagating planetary waves are present .\nHolton and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition because at certain times the correlation broke down .\nKarin Labitzke ( 1987 ) noticed that the polar vortex\u2013QBO correlation broke down sometimes during the westerly phase of the QBO , but only when solar activity was near its cyclical maximum .\nShe decided to segregate the data on stratospheric polar temperatures according to QBO phase .\nThe very low correlation between solar activity and polar temperatures , when all data are considered , becomes very high using the segregated data ( Fig .\n1.7 ) .\nAfter 186 years Labitzke had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1801 .\nIn a follow-up article with Harry van Loon ( Labitzke & van Loon 1988 ) they extended the study on the solar effect on winter atmospheric pressure and temperature to the Northern Hemisphere troposphere .\nA main conclusion from this work is that the signal of the QBO in the extratropical stratosphere was strengthened in solar minima and weakened in solar maxima .\nThat the QBO orientation flips the solar effect from one sign to its opposite is not unlike other correlation sign-reversals in the sun-climate effect , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mediated by changes in TSI .\nIn Peixoto and Oort \u2019 s ( 1992 ) indispensable Physics of Climate manual Labitzke and van Loon \u2019 s findings were properly appraised .\nAfter declaring it the most convincing statistical evidence of a solar-weather relationship found , they continue : \u201c Even at the earth

phenomena , and reanalysis is fed real climate data , the sun-climate effect keeps appearing , defying whack-a-mole attempts to keep it buried .\nIn 1996 Joanna Haigh showed in a landmark article in Science that changes in atmospheric circulation , reproduced only weakly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Haigh 1996 ) .\nTropical ozone changes appeared to be critical for the effect in the model .\nIt soon became clear that the changes in TSI during the solar cycle did not involve enough energy to explain the observed climate effects .\nSo , it was assumed that some sort of amplifying mechanism was responsible .\nEven though climate models did not include the stratosphere until recently , Haigh developed what is known as the \u201c Top-down mechanism \u201d for amplifying the solar effect on climate ( Fig .\n1.8 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for amplifying the solar effect on climate .\nSolar UV radiation acts on the ozone layer in the stratosphere increasing its temperature ( T ) and the amount of ozone ( O ) .\nThe change in temperature alters the latitudinal temperature gradient , and through thermal wind balance affects the zonal-mean zonal winds ( \u0394U ) .\nThe change in zonal winds alters the properties of the atmosphere for propagating planetary waves .\nThe effect creates an anomalous divergence ( > 0 ) of the Eliassen-Palm flux ( F ) proportional to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposition of momentum and kinetic energy .\nThe strength of the polar vortex ( not shown ) depends on those changes , driving changes in the Arctic Oscillation ( AO ) , North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ) , and the Hadley

regional response both at the surface and in the atmosphere .\nThe effect of a grand solar minimum , like the Maunder Minimum , is considered to be less than a few tenths of a \u00b0C of global cooling ( Lean 2017 ) .\nOver the following five parts in this series of articles we will explain the recently proposed Winter Gatekeeper hypothesis of sun-climate effect ( Vin\u00f3s 2022 ) .\nIt

King ( 1975 ) As showed in Part I of this series , the early 1980s saw a reversal in the consensus about an important sun-weather effect .\nThe adversarial academic environment resulted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this subject .\nDespite these difficulties , important advances have been made regarding the sun-climate effect .\nLack of interest and disregard for a competing climate change mechanism hypothesis by mainstream climatologists has resulted in these advances being ignored .\nThey remain under-cited and unknown to most supporters and skeptics of the CO hypothesis .\nMore importantly , they are not discussed in most climate papers , they are simply ignored .\nThese advances refer to climate phenomena that typically are not properly included in climate models due to lack of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them .\nThey are not , or only weakly , reproduced by models , yet in most cases they can be detected in climate reanalyses where the models are constrained by a huge number of real observations .\nImportantly , no hypothesis for a sun-climate effect can be correct if it can not explain or accommodate the relationship between these phenomena and solar variability .\nThe sun-climate relationship , at present , represents a black hole in modern climatology that keeps growing without anybody seeing inside it .\nPaleoclimatology is the only subfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important sun-climate effect is considered .\nThis is because the data obtained from proxy climate records of the Holocene often display a clear association with solar activity data obtained from proxy solar records .\nWhen one of us ( JV ) researched the climatic effects of the 2500-yr sun-climate cycle discovered by Roger Bray in 1968 ( Fig .\n2.1 ) , he quickly found 28 articles studying proxies that clearly displayed this cycle ( Vin\u00f3s 2022 ) .\nOf those , 16 ( 57 % ) explicitly state that changes in solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed climatic changes , and only one explicitly rules the solar connection out .\nWe are talking about profound global climatic changes of the distant past , similar in magnitude to the Little Ice Age ( LIA ) or modern global warming .\nMost paleoclimate researchers studying them conclude they were caused by changes in solar activity .\nModern climatology can not explain them since they took place at times when greenhouse gas radiative forcing changed

good example of the effects of solar variability on paleoclimatology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate cycle observed in the Holocene .\nIn terms of solar activity , it is defined by a sequence of Sp\u00f6rer-type grand solar minima that last 200 years and display a 20\u2030 increase in radiocarbon , spaced at 2500 \u00b1 200 years with only a gap at c. 7,700 BP in the last eight periods since 20,500 BP ( Fig .\n2.1b ; Vin\u00f3s 2022 ) .\nIn terms of climate , all the lows of the cycle are marked by periods of severe climate deterioration lasting over a century and reflected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutes the most recent and the coldest example of the Holocene ( Fig .\n2.1a ) .\nIn terms of the effects on human societies of the past , the Bray cycle lows are marked by periods of upheaval , population decrease ( Fig .\n2.1c ) , and civilization collapse , followed by societal advance afterward in response to a difficult situation .\nThe correspondence between past solar activity and past climate at the centennial and millennial timescales has caused authors like Rohling et al .\n( 2002 ) to say : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we call for an in-depth multi-disciplinary assessment of the potential for solar modulation of climate on centennial scales.\n\u201d \u201c On a centennial scale , the successive climatic events which punctuated the entire Holocene in the central Mediterranean coincided with cooling events associated with deglacial outbursts in the North Atlantic area and decreases in solar activity during the interval 11700\u20137000 cal BP , and to a possible combination of NAO-type circulation and solar forcing since ca .\n7000 cal BP onwards.\n\u201d \u201c Our results imply that small variations in solar irradiance induced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey also provide evidence that centennial-scale shifts in the Holocene climate were similar between the subpolar regions of the North Atlantic and North Pacific , possibly because of Sun-ocean-climate linkages.\n\u201d Those three articles , between them , have 50 co-authors , among them some of the most respected in paleoclimatology .\nEither our current understanding of the sun-climate effect or our current understanding of paleoclimatology is wrong , as they are incompatible .\nIn science when in doubt go with the evidence .\nPaleoclimatology has the evidence , while our current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect programmers \u2019 ignorance and biases .\nThe increase in solar irradiance during the 11-yr cycle is about 1.1 W/m2 .\nThe expected surface warming for such a change in energy is only 0.025 \u00b0C and therefore below detection ( Wigley & Raper 1990 ) .\nTemperature data and reanalysis consistently show that the solar signal in global temperature is c. 0.1 \u00b0C , four times larger than expected from the energy change alone ( Lean 2017 ) thus the need for amplifying mechanisms .\nA very small energy increase from the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small evenly distributed temperature change at the surface .\nThis is not what happens .\nThe change in surface temperature manifests itself in an unexplained , but significant , regional and hemispheric variation and some regions cool when more energy is coming from the sun ( Fig .\n2.2 ) .\nThese differences can only be attributed to significant dynamic changes in the atmosphere and oceans when the solar output varies by only 0.1 % .\nFig .\n2.2 Solar effects on temperature and paleoclimatology .\na ) Surface temperature change map during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grid from the 1996 solar minimum to the 2002 solar maximum using multiple regression .\nA pattern of discontinuous Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude warming is indicated by circles .\nThe main western boundary currents in the Northern Hemisphere are indicated by arrows .\nExamples of climate change responses to increasing solar activity obtained from paleo evidence or long climate records are superimposed at their location .\nb ) Zonally averaged change in surface ( black line ) and 20 km height ( red line ) temperature ( without a cosine area adjustment for latitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the global average surface temperature increase with the solar cycle is of only 0.1 \u00b0C , at 60\u00b0N it reaches 0.4 \u00b0C ( above 1 \u00b0C at some areas ) .\nThis general pattern of increased surface warming in the Northern Hemisphere extra-tropics and reduced warming in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere produced by increasing solar activity is not unlike the observed surface warming during the past 50 years .\nThe surface temperature effect over North America confirms Currie \u2019 s ( 1993 ) finding that the solar effect on temperatures is opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see Part I ) .\nAnother feature of solar induced warming is a pattern of alternating Southern Hemisphere ( SH ) mid-latitude warming and minimal change or cooling with a spacing of c. 7000 km ( Fig .\n2.2a circles ) .\nThey are a tropospheric-ocean phenomenon , and are more conspicuous at 5 km altitude ( see Lean 2017 ) and probably reflect the global wavenumber-4 atmospheric wave whose importance for SH climate has been recently observed ( Chiswell 2021 ) .\nThis solar modulated atmospheric wave-train phenomenon could be related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ & Barnes 2014 ) .\nAs the atmosphere is intrinsically unstable , large-scale periodic atmospheric variability is very rare outside the tropics , as most atmospheric phenomena display red noise characteristics .\nOne of the few examples is the baroclinic annular mode , a 25\u201330-day oscillation in the SH extratropical eddy kinetic energy associated with variations in the amplitude of vertically propagating waves , that has important effects on regional climate .\nThe strong periodicity in the baroclinic annular mode , that coincides with the solar rotation period , together with the wavenumber-4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are suggestive of the baroclinic annular mode being modulated by changes in solar activity .\nLon Hood has demonstrated that solar UV peaks modulate another atmospheric oscillation , the Madden\u2013Julian Oscillation .\nDaily changes in Madden\u2013Julian Oscillation amplitude are modulated by UV changes , with their amplitude increasing following UV minima .\nThis amplitude modulating effect is greater during the winter and spring and is strongest during the easterly phase of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation ( Hood 2018 ) .\nGiven that the solar rotation period is close to one month , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satellite data there are c. 500 solar rotations , allowing a much better statistical evaluation of the short-term solar effect on climate .\nAnother feature of the surface temperature pattern associated with the solar cycle is the warming displayed at the extra-tropical western boundary currents , particularly in the NH ( Fig .\n2.2a , arrows ) .\nThese are preferred sites where energy is transferred from the ocean to the atmosphere ( Yu & Weller 2007 ) .\nThe incoming energy difference associated with the solar cycle is very small , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those sites suggests that oceanic-atmospheric dynamic processes are regulated by changes in the solar cycle .\nFinally , the surface temperature pattern is essentially the reverse of the near-tropopause ( 20 km ; Fig .\n2.2b ) pattern , except at NH high latitudes .\nSurface temperature changes are not the result of direct changes in TSI , since they are regionally very diverse and four times higher than the TSI energy budget allows .\nThis suggests that the contrasting surface and tropopause zonal temperature patterns arise from troposphere-stratosphere coupling .\nNot only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean displays a puzzling quasi-decadal change in temperature of c. 0.1 \u00b0C .\nWhite et al .\n( 2003 ) analyzed the global tropical diabatic heat storage budget and found that the anomalous heating of the upper layer of the ocean to the depth of the 22\u00b0C isotherm yielded a value of \u00b1 0.9 W/m2 , that is nearly an order of magnitude larger than the surface radiative forcing of \u00b1 0.1 W/m2 associated with the solar cycle ( solar radiative forcing is \u0394TSI/4 x 0.7 ) .\nEven more , the quasi-decadal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase-locked to the solar cycle , something that modern climatology can not explain .\nThe near total lack of interest by modern climatologists in the sun-climate effect neglects the abundant evidence from paleoclimatology and recent climate variations that correlate with the solar-cycle .\nThis reveals our poor knowledge of the solar effect on climate change .\nWe are all born ignorant , but some scientists choose to remain so regarding the sun-climate question .\nAs reviewed in Part I ( Sect .\n1.6 ) , it has been known since 1980 that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vortex ( Holton & Tan 1980 ) .\nSeven years later , Labitzke ( 1987 ) discovered that changes in solar activity affected this modulation .\nIt was the first solid , indisputable and climatically relevant sun-climate effect found in a 180-year-old quest .\nIt also explained why the quest had been so difficult , as the effect is non-linear ( not proportional to the total irradiance difference ) and indirect , depending on the direction ( QBO phase ) and strength of the equatorial stratospheric winds .\nThe North Pole stratospheric temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the polar vortex .\nA strong polar vortex is surrounded by strong winds , keeping inside an area of low pressure , low geopotential height ( height of a given pressure ) , and low temperature due to radiative cooling .\nHigher temperatures denote a weaker and/or displaced polar vortex .\nWhen the polar vortex becomes weaker and/or displaced during the winter ( i.e.\n, higher North Pole stratospheric temperature ) , warmer air enters the Arctic , pushing the colder air below towards lower latitudes .\nA warmer North Pole with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mid-latitudes .\nA higher frequency of colder winters in northern mid-high latitudes was a feature of the LIA .\nLabitzke \u2019 s data showed that stratospheric North Pole temperature correlation to solar forcing depends on QBO state .\nDuring easterly QBO years stratospheric polar temperature is lowest when solar activity is highest , and highest when solar activity is lowest .\nThe opposite occurs during westerly QBO years ( Fig .\n2.3a ) .\nSince the lowest easterly-year and highest westerly-year temperatures are similar , the largest temperature differences for the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum years .\nThe average winter North Pole stratospheric temperature difference between both QBO phases during solar minima is an astounding 20 \u00b0C ( Fig .\n2.3b ) .\nThe winter climatic effect of low solar activity over ample regions of the North Hemisphere is clearly disproportionate to the total irradiance energy difference .\nDifference that becomes irrelevant over the North Pole during the boreal winter , when it is in constant darkness .\nFig .\n2.3 Effect of solar activity on winter North

unusually high correlation between solar activity and sea-level pressure or surface temperature over extensive areas of the NH , when the QBO phase is considered , appear to explain an important

effect ( see Part I , Sect .\n1.6 ) and on El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tropical volcanic eruptions stabilize the vortex which produces a warmer northern mid-high

mechanisms of the solar variability effect on climate via a dynamic atmospheric coupling , so it isn \u2019 t as if he didn \u2019 t know about it .\nModern climatology is deliberately ignoring what is known about the sun-climate effect .\nThe solar effect on ENSO is absolutely unrecognized by modern climatology .\nA recent review on ENSO complexity by 45 prominent ENSO experts ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fails to mention any solar implication despite the abundant bibliography on the subject ( Anderson 1990 ; Landscheidt 2000 ; White & Liu 2008 ; Wang et al .\n2020 ; Leamon et al .\n2021 ; Lin et al .\n2021 ) .\nDeser et al .\n( 2010 ) analyze the power spectrum of the Ni\u00f1o-3.4 ( 5\u00b0N\u20135\u00b0S , 170\u2013120\u00b0W ) SST time series and only mention the 2.5\u20138 years range , completely ignoring the distinct 11-yr peak in the series ( Fig .\n2.4b ) .\nOne of the authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between increasing solar activity and La Ni\u00f1a conditions in the Ni\u00f1o-3.4 region Oceanic Ni\u00f1o Index ( ONI ) .\nA Monte Carlo analysis showed that the La Ni\u00f1a occurrences , which took place during times of rising solar activity ( from 35 to 80 % of the ascending phase of the solar cycle ) , between 1950\u20132018 , have only a 0.7 % probability of being due to chance , demonstrating that ENSO is modulated by solar activity ( Vin\u00f3s 2019 ; 2022 ) .\nThe recent La Ni\u00f1a conditions since 2020 after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have reduced the already low probability that the association is due to chance .\nThe solar-ENSO modulation is uncovered by a simple frequency analysis of ENSO modes .\nENSO displays three temporal modes : El Ni\u00f1o ( warm mode ) , La Ni\u00f1a ( cool mode ) , and Neutral .\nThe ENSO system is usually considered to be an oscillation

1\u20133 Nin\u0303os in a 5-year period .\nLa Nin\u0303a and Neutral years are more variable , as there can be 0\u20134 of each in a 5-year period .\nThe strong anti-correlation between La Nin\u0303a and Neutral years indicates ENSO has been profoundly misunderstood and even its naming is incorrect , as it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm water volume in the equatorial Pacific ( Fig .\n2.4c ) indicates that energy tends to accumulate during Ni\u00f1a years , and it is released during Ni\u00f1o years , with Neutral years somewhere in between .\nEnergy tends to accumulate in the equatorial Pacific , one of the major solar energy entry points into the climate system .\nThe ENSO system oscillates between accumulation ( Ni\u00f1a years ) and inefficient distribution ( Neutral years ) .\nWhen the system accumulates excess energy , Los Ni\u00f1os occur to efficiently spread the excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe La Ni\u00f1a/Neutral oscillation is phase locked to the solar cycle ( Fig .\n2.4a ) .\nEl Ni\u00f1o frequency is also affected by the solar cycle , as other authors have noted ( Landscheidt 2000 ) , but not so strongly , and the occurrence of Ni\u00f1o years slightly perturbs the Ni\u00f1a/Neutral fit to the solar cycle .\nThis solar effect on ENSO explains the 11-year frequency peak in the Ni\u00f1o-3.4 SST power spectrum .\nIt also explains why multidecadal periods of high solar activity , like the modern solar maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and why the period of reduced solar activity since 1998 has displayed more frequent Ni\u00f1as with less negative warm water volume anomaly values .\nCoinciding with the Pause in global warming , warm water volume anomalies have significantly fewer negative values , reaching less than one fourth of previous negative values ( Fig .\n2.4c ) .\nEl Ni\u00f1o is the odd one out in the Ni\u00f1a/Neutral oscillation , which explains why El Ni\u00f1o comes in different flavors ( Central Pacific versus Eastern Pacific ) and displays an enormous variability during the Holocene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Ni\u00f1o activity very reduced during the Holocene Climatic Optimum .\nEl Ni\u00f1o flavor , frequency , and intensity respond to the requirements of the poleward meridional energy transport process .\nOne can only wonder that , if modern climatology wasn \u2019 t so blind to the sun-climate effect , the solar modulation of ENSO would be common knowledge and discussed in reviews like Timmermann et al .\n( 2018 ) and Domeisen et al .\n( 2019 ) .\nIt is embarrassing , and an indication that modern climatology has lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a molecular biologist to notice .\nSolar activity affects the Earth \u2019 s speed of rotation .\nThe effect is small , but it has been measured since the advent of atomic clocks in the late 1950s .\nThis solar effect has been noticed periodically by researchers , reported , ignored , and forgotten , only to be noticed again by another researcher believing it was an original discovery .\nThe first report appears to be by Ren\u00e9 Danjon in 1962 .\nIn 1971 Rodney Challinor , with 14 years of data , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of day ( LOD ) to the sunspot cycle .\nHe suggested that changes in the global atmospheric circulation induced by solar activity changes might be responsible for the effect on Earth \u2019 s rotation rate ( Challinor 1971 ) .\nJan Vondr\u00e1k ( 1977 ) and Robert Currie ( 1980 ) also rediscovered the solar-Earth rotation relationship .\nIn the 1990s Daniel Gambis ( Gambis & Bourget 1993 ) and in the 2000s Rodrigo Abarca del R\u00edo ( Abarca del

circulation ( Lambeck & Cazennave 1973 ) .\nThe biennial component of \u2206LOD reflects changes in the QBO ( Lambeck & Hopgood 1981 ) , while the 3\u20134-year component matches the ENSO signal ( Haas & Scherneck 2004 ) .\nThe 2015\u201316 El Nin\u0303o produced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 .\nA very close fit between the semi-annual component in \u2206LOD and solar activity should not be expected given these other causal agents .\nThe link between changes in \u0394LOD , changes in AAM , and solar variability is very straightforward , and necessarily must go in the direction \u201c solar \u2192 atmosphere \u2192 rotation.\n\u201d The momentum of the Earth system is conserved at the scales involved and it is not possible that changes in the speed of rotation of the Earth affect solar activity .\nA relationship between multidecadal changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed by Lambeck and Cazenave ( 1976 ) .\nWithout considering a solar implication , they reported on the similarity between the trends of numerous climate indices for the past two centuries and changes in \u2206LOD .\nIn particular , Lambeck and Cazenave noted that LOD variations correlate well with the global temperature and with ground pressure , both of which are indicators of global wind circulation .\nThey concluded that periods of increasing zonal winds correlate with an acceleration of the Earth while periods of decreasing zonal circulation correlate with a deceleration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lag of 5\u201310 years in the climatic indices .\nTheir result has been reproduced multiple times ( e.g.\n, Mazzarella 2013 ) .\nFig .\n2.6 Decadal band pass filtered times series of the sunspot number ( red ) and ( B ) the annual amplitude modulation of the AAM ; and ( C ) the inverted semiannual amplitude modulation of the AAM .\nFrom Abarca del R\u00edo & Gambis ( 2011 ) .\nThe AAM can be reconstructed back to 1870 , and its decadal changes in the annual and semiannual components @ @ @ @ @ @ @ components of \u2206LOD ) display a correlation with the 11-yr solar cycle .\nInterestingly the correlation between the annual component and the sunspot number underwent a phase shift c. 1920 ( Fig .\n2.6B ) .\nThis is a time when multiple sun-climate correlations inverted ( see Part I , Fig .\n1.3 ) , discrediting sun-climate correlation studies .\nWe do not know what causes these inversions in the climate response to solar activity and probably we will not know until a new inversion takes place , since we need to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey appear to occur every 80\u2013120 years ( Hoyt & Schatten 1997 ) .\nHowever , we can conclude two important things from the existence of these sun-climate inversions .\nFirst , that solar activity affects climate through its effect on atmospheric circulation ( AAM ) , not through differences in total irradiance .\nAnd second , when the solar effect on the annual component of the AAM shifts phases , the solar effect pattern on surface temperature and precipitation inverts .\nThe simultaneous occurrence of the phase shift in AAM ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inversion at c. 1920 demonstrates that these shifts are an intrinsic feature of the sun-climate effect .\nSince the solar effect on Earth \u2019 s rotation rate and global atmospheric circulation are deliberately ignored by modern climatology , they are not included in general circulation models .\nThis allows the IPCC to wrongly conclude that solar variability has no significant effect on climate change since 1850 .\nThe reality , however , is that a great part of the climate change that has taken place during the 20th century has been due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Colin Hines proposed that the sun-climate effect could be accomplished by modulating the planetary waves propagation properties of the atmosphere , and James Holton agreed that such mechanism was viable , but objected that little evidence existed for it at the time ( Hines 1974 ; Holton 1982 ) .\nThis was not entirely correct .\nGeller and Alpert ( 1980 ) not only demonstrated the viability of the Hines mechanism but showed that changes in the sun \u2019 s ultraviolet ( UV ) emissions , by changing the stratospheric thermal structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mean zonal wind , resulting in inter-annual variations in stationary planetary wave patterns that could induce very significant changes in regional climate .\nTheir modeling results not only quantified the magnitude of the expected effects but indicated that the tropospheric planetary wave response to solar-induced changes in the zonal mean state of the stratosphere ought to be regional , very evident at some longitudes and latitudes , and absent in others ( Fig .\n2.2 ) .\nWaves in the atmosphere ( Fig .\n2.7 ) are oscillatory motions that result from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parcel of air that has been set in movement and a restoring force .\nThese oscillatory motions produce periodic changes in atmospheric variables ( pressure , geopotential height , temperature , or wind velocity ) that may remain stationary or propagate horizontally or vertically .\nAtmospheric waves transmit energy and momentum without material transport of air parcels to remote regions on time scales much shorter than the transit time for air parcels .\nThe momentum and energy are fed into the background flow as the wave dissipates or breaks , altering it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more types of atmospheric wave ( Holton 2003 ) .\nFig .\n2.7 Examples of atmospheric waves .\na ) Atmospheric waves made visible by Saharan dust over the northwestern coast of Africa .\nCredit : NASA .\nb ) Atmospheric waves caused by the Tonga 2022 eruption that circled the globe captured by NOAA \u2019 s GOES-West satellite IR channel .\nTonga is located at the bottom left of the image .\nCredit : Mathew Barlow .\nAfter Duncombe ( 2022 ) Vertically propagating planetary ( Rossby-Haurwitz ) waves are generated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent\u2013ocean heating contrasts , and by nonlinear interactions among transient tropospheric wave disturbances .\nTheir restoring force is the potential vorticity latitudinal gradient induced by the Coriolis parameter due to planetary rotation .\nPlanetary waves zonal wavenumber is an integer designating the number of waves around a latitude circle , thus at 60\u00b0 a wavenumber 1 planetary wave has c. 12,000 km meridional scale .\nThe vertical propagation of stationary planetary waves requires the presence of mean westerly winds of speed lower than a critical value , in what is known as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wavenumbers 1\u20133 account for over 96 % of wave propagation into the extratropical stratosphere , and this happens only in the winter hemisphere .\nSmall changes in solar UV energy can cause big changes in the energy and momentum delivered by planetary waves to the stratosphere .\nThese are then reflected in changes in the troposphere , through the stratosphere-troposphere coupling , as suggested by Hines ( 1974 ) , and shown by Geller and Alpert ( 1980 ) .\nThis process constitutes the basis of the \u201c top-down \u201d mechanism of sun-climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem of the small change in solar energy output during the solar cycle , as the energy to affect climate is provided by planetary waves , which alter the global atmospheric circulation in regionally diverse patterns .\nKodera and Kuroda ( 2002 ) showed that with the arrival of winter , the stratospheric circulation changes from a radiatively controlled state to a dynamically controlled state , and the transition is modulated by solar activity , with the solar maximum prolonging the radiatively controlled state .\nThis modulation affects the strength of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Brewer\u2013Dobson circulation .\nPerlwitz and Harnik ( 2003 ) provided evidence that planetary waves reflected in the stratosphere on certain winters had a tropospheric effect .\nNathan et al .\n( 2011 ) showed that the zonally asymmetric ozone field was very important in mediating the effects of solar variability on the wave-driven circulation in the stratosphere .\nThe study of planetary waves in the stratosphere is recent and difficult to carry out .\nPowell and Xu ( 2011 ) , using two reanalysis datasets and satellite microwave sounding unit observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the 55\u201375\u00b0N stratosphere and showed that it was associated with the Arctic Oscillation .\nThey found substantial shifts in the stratospheric state due to changes in wave amplitude and pattern anomalies .\nThe main ones were associated with a 2-year oscillation that was in phase with the solar cycle .\nDuring solar maxima planetary wave amplitude was reduced , while during solar minima changes in the meridional temperature gradient and vertical wind shear lead to an increase in planetary wave amplitude ( Fig .\n2.8 ) .\nThe detected solar cycle effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variability in wave amplitude ( Powell & Xu 2011 ) .\nFig .\n2.8 Variability in the 55\u201375\u00b0N stratospheric planetary wave amplitude shows the alignment of its biennial oscillation with the solar cycle , displaying maximal amplitude variation during solar minima .\nThe Powell and Xu ( 2011 ) finding provides direct observational evidence for the Geller and Alpert ( 1980 ) study .\nIn their study , Geller and Alpert showed that a 20 % change in the mean zonal flow at 35 km height or lower would be the required order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variability in the tropospheric wave pattern at middle and high latitudes .\nThe finding by Powell and Xu that the solar effect might explain 25 % of stratospheric wave amplitude indicates that the UV solar effect , coupled with ozone variability , can explain the important sun-climate effect on winter atmospheric circulation first detected by Labitzke and van Loon ( 1988 ) .\nThis part ( 2nd of the series ) demonstrates the existence of a wealth of knowledge about the sun-climate effect , laboriously produced by scientists that have not received proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably the most complex , most controversial problem in climatology .\nThis knowledge provides sufficient clues about the sun-climate effect mechanism .\nIt is no longer acceptable to say that solar variability in total irradiance is too small to have a significant effect on climate , when there is so much evidence that variations in total irradiance are not how solar variability mainly affects climate .\nIt is no longer acceptable to say that indirect effects of solar variability are too uncertain since their mechanism is unknown when clear evidence for the mechanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer acceptable to only consider changes in total irradiance in model studies and then declare that the modern solar maximum did not contribute to modern global warming .\nIt is no longer acceptable to reject a sun-climate effect based on the lack of a simple correspondence between surface temperature and solar activity , when evidence suggests that the solar effect on climate works through changes in atmospheric circulation .\nIf it remains acceptable , then we are building the foundations of climate change science on a false premise that prevents us from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scientific advancement of climatology by decades , just as the refusal to accept the evidence for continental drift set geology back four decades .\nAnd it will have huge repercussions for the reputation of science , as most climatologists provide a justification for expensive socioeconomic policies while ignoring an important , well-documented , solar-climate connection .", "author": "curryja", "url":

initiatives .\nThere is much discussion as to why this bill looks like it will pass , when previous climate bills ( carbon tax , carbon cap and trade ) failed .\nThe Senate bill includes billions of dollars in tax credits and subsidies for clean energy and electric vehicles .\nIn addition to renewable-energy funding , there is also commitment to federal oil and gas expansion , albeit with fines for excessive methane leakage .\nThe bill includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Native Hawaiians and other disadvantaged areas disproportionately impacted by pollution and climate warming .\nFunds are also allocated to tackle drought remediation in the West .\nI \u2019 ve received requests to write on this topic , here are some bits and pieces that I \u2019 ve pulled together .\nMy main points : \u2022 Post-apocalyptic climate politics have a much better chance of succeeding than fear-driven apocalyptic climate politics \u2022 Energy policy should be detached from climate policy to make a robust transition to a 21st century energy system that emphasizes abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with minimal impact on the environment ( including land use ) .\nMotivated by international treaties and the UNFCCC Paris Agreement , countries and municipalities are declaring a \u201c climate emergency \u201d or \u201c crisis \u201d that requires urgent and strong climate policies to avoid both local and global catastrophe .\nBusiness-as-usual climate policy is based on what has been referred to as the politics of \u201c climate scarcity \u201d ( Asayama ) , whereby there is an upper limit to the level of warming ( and thereby CO emissions ) that must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change .\nThe politics of climate scarcity is associated with the politics of energy and material scarcity , blaming climate change on extravagant lifestyles and requiring a long period of belt-tightening if we are to survive the crisis .\nThe failure of the world \u2019 s governments to make much headway in reducing emissions is blamed on several factors .\nThe main impediment to progress is blamed on fossil fuel companies , who wield power through political influence via financial contributions and propaganda .\nCapitalism is being blamed because manufacturers , farmers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and equipment needed by the economy and general population .\nDemocracy is being blamed , since democratic decision making is too slow and sometimes people don \u2019 t make the \u201c right \u201d decision .\nArguments are being made for degrowth , which is the idea that economic growth is environmentally unsustainable and should be halted , at least in wealthy countries .\nWith the failure of most countries to significantly reduce CO emissions , activists and governments are using \u201c random gambits to kneecap fossil fuel production.\n\u201d These include restricting permits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil and gas pipelines , getting organizations to divest their funds from fossil fuel companies , and restricting access to loans and other financial resources for fossil fuel companies .\nAttempts to limit CO emissions from the demand side by imposing carbon taxes have been politically very unpopular .\nEven among people who are supportive of addressing the climate change problem , they are unwilling to pay higher energy prices .\nThe politics of scarcity is not an easy sell , particularly when framed in terms of anti-democracy , anti-capitalism and degrowth .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcity haven \u2019 t worked .\nHowever , letting go of the apocalyptic rhetoric is difficult for those who have built careers based on climate catastrophism .\nClimate politics business-as-usual ( the apocalyptic version ) expects people in developed countries to exercise energy and material restraint for the altruistic motives of \u201c saving the climate \u201d , while at the same time slowing down development in Africa by not supporting access to their own energy resources .\nWhile the vast majority of people believe that climate change is a real problem , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel and continued economic expansion much more than they fear climate change .\nMaking people \u2019 s energy less abundant and/or increasing its price is politically toxic unless there is an urgent , short-term need for austerity .\nLets face it \u2014 the climate \u201c crisis \u201d isn \u2019 t what it used to be .\nCirca 2013 with publication of the IPCC AR5 , RCP8.5 was regarded as the business-as-usual emissions scenario , with expected warming of 4 to 5oC .\nNow there is growing acceptance that RCP8.5 is implausible , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenario .\nOnly a few years ago , an emissions trajectory that followed RCP4.5 with 2 to 3oC warming was regarded as climate policy success .\nNow that limiting warming to 2oC seems to be in reach ( now deemed to be the \u201c threshold of catastrophe \u201d ) , the goal posts were moved in 2018 to reduce the target to 1.5oC .\nA few weeks ago , in defending its decision to issue fossil fuel prospecting permits in spite of declaring a climate emergency , the New Zealand government stated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to halt oil and gas exploration .\nClimate change is indeed an \u201c insufficient \u201d crisis .\nAdam Smith in the Wealth of Nations ( 1776 ) points the way towards a post-apocalyptic climate politics .\nThere is growing support for a climate politics that harnesses enlightened self-interest , rather than focusing on austerity .\nIn other words : carrots , not sticks .\nThere are three major political issues that fall under the climate umbrella : \u2022 The desire for clean , abundant and cheap energy for the global population \u2022 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and climate events \u2022 Concerns about rising atmospheric concentrations on CO and its impact on the climate Issues # 1 and # 2 are primarily dealt with by national and subnational entities , and receive widespread political and economic support if they support local self-interests .\nIssue # 3 is politically controversial since international policies have attempted a top-down approach that controls # 1 and # 2 by the emphasis on rapid reduction of fossil fuel emissions , with the specter of energy scarcity and a redirection of international funds away from development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 and # 2 is a quieter kind of climate politics ( \u201c don \u2019 t mention the climate \u201d , an adaptation of a Fawlty Towers skit \u201c don \u2019 t mention the war \u201d ) , which doesn \u2019 t require the apocalyptic rhetoric but rather addresses concerns and opportunities that people are enthusiastic about addressing .\nActions taken willingly and enthusiastically are more effective politically and have higher moral legitimacy because of the absence of coercion .\nA focus on issues # 1 and # 2 supports the flourishing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should act to de-escalate the political controversies associated with the climate change issue .\nFurther splitting off issues like water resources and food security from the climate issue allows for addressing real problems at a more local level , without expecting a reduction in atmospheric CO concentrations to actually ameliorate anything on decadal time scales .\nOnce we acknowledge that we don \u2019 t currently know how to fully address the challenge of stabilizing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at a low level on the timescale of decades , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for issues # 1 and # 2 and other ancillary issues that currently live under the climate umbrella , all the while focusing on supporting human flourishing and thriving in the 21st century .\nIf we deal with all of these other issues , human-caused climate change becomes something we don \u2019 t even need to talk about \u2013 we will be prospering because of abundant and inexpensive energy and can afford to reduce our vulnerability to climate change ( both natural and human-caused ) .\nAnd incidentally , CO emissions will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green vortex \u201d shows how the learning curve for new green technologies will continue to accelerate .\nWhy did the Senate IRA bill succeed where other US attempts at climate legislation failed ?\nOne narrative is that the adverse impacts from recent extreme weather events has finally overwhelmed the \u201c evil \u201d strategy of oil , gas and coal companies of sowing doubt about the severity of climate change .\nThe other , more convincing narrative is that this bill offered monetary incentives to industries and consumers to switch to clean energy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 related taxes .\nEssentially , lawmakers replaced the sticks with carrots .\nTime for the environmental economists to eat humble pie .\nA further reason for the success was labelling this as Inflation Reduction Act .\nThis ( mostly ) misnomer is politically very useful in avoiding the reflexive association of this bill with often nutty climate policies driven by the apocalyptic version of climate politics .\nThe bill also includes provisions for gas and oil exploration .\nWhile the apocalyptites regard this as a deep flaw , it is actually an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce CO emissions needs to acknowledge that fossil fuels are needed to fuel the 21st century energy transition .\nAttempts to speed up the transition away from fossil fuels by restricting the production of fossil fuels and new generating plants has backfired by making many countries reliant on Russia \u2019 s fossil fuels .\nThe geopolitical instability associated with Russia \u2019 s war against Ukraine highlights the importance of having multiple options and safety margins \u2013 key characteristics of robustness .\nSafety margin strategies in electric power systems include redundancy , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve power .\nOvercapacity should be a feature of future energy systems , not a bug .\nAnd for now , this needs to include fossil fuels .\nSo while this bill was a political win , I have to say if I was in charge of $ 400B to support the energy transition I would have focused on R & D for advanced nuclear and geothermal plus smart microgrids .\nEveryone wants cheap , abundant , reliable , secure and clean energy .\nWhile fossil fuels have fueled human progress in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a strong rationale for reducing our reliance on fossil fuels for energy \u2013 independent of their impact on atmospheric CO concentrations and air and water quality .\nMining for fossil fuels has large , continuing economic and environmental costs .\nFossil fuels will become increasingly expensive to extract by the 22nd century .\nThe Russian war on Ukraine highlights the vulnerability of fossil fuel supply chains and price spikes to geopolitical instability .\nThere are many reasons to support a new energy system ( independent of CO emissions ) that will set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 21st century .\nHere are some considerations for the 21st century energy systems , outlined in terms of values and risks/dangers The 21st century energy transition can be facilitated with minimal regrets by : \u2022 Accepting that the world will continue to need and desire much more energy \u2013 energy austerity such as during the 1970s is off the table .\n\u2022 Accepting that we will need more fossil fuels in the near term to maintain energy security and reliability and to facilitate the transition in terms of developing and implementing new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop and test a range of options for energy production , transmission and other technologies that address goals of lessening the environmental impact of energy production , CO emissions and other societal values \u2022 Using the next two to three decades as a learning period with new technologies , experimentation and intelligent trial and error ( let the \u201c green vortex \u201d work ) , without the restrictions of near-term targets for CO In the near term , laying the foundation for zero-carbon electricity is substantially more important than trying to immediately stamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be allowed to develop its own natural gas resources .\nThe transition should focus on developing and deploying new sources of clean energy .\nThe transition should not focus on eliminating electricity from fossil fuels , since we will need much more energy to support the materials required for renewable energy and battery storage and building nuclear power plants , as well as to support growing numbers of electric vehicles and heat pumps .\nThe build out of wind , solar and natural gas can fuel the transition , but this combination probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better technologies that become available in the coming decades .\nThe push for weather-based renewable energy \u2013 wind , solar , hydro \u2013 seems somewhat ironic to me .\nOne of the main motivations for transitioning away from fossil fuels is to avoid the extreme weather that is alleged to be associated with increasing CO levels .\nSo why subject our energy supply to the vagaries of water droughts , wind droughts , icing and forest fires ?\nIn any event , the growth of renewable energy has been a substantial boon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electric utilities sector .\nTransmission upgrades needs to play a key role in the transition .\nModernization of the transition grid is needed to enhance reliability and resiliency , improve cybersecurity and prevent outages due to extreme weather .\nSmart grids can allow advanced control of load supply and demand .\nDeveloping and evaluating microgrids would substantially support the learning curve for incorporating distributed energy resources to improve transmission and make it more flexible .\nTransformation of the electric power sector will require considerable inputs of raw materials , including rare earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cement steel , and fiberglass .\nApart from the amount of energy required to mine , process and refine these materials , some critical materials are concentrated in a few countries , which will change the geopolitical dynamics .\nBuilding stable supply chains for critical materials is critical for the growth of wind , solar and battery storage .\nA circular economy with reuse and recycling will help minimize environmental impacts and supply chain shocks .\nTechnologies that use low cost , readily available materials will have an advantage in being adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nChina has developed its energy systems at an astonishing speed .\nAn autocratic government with a top-down energy strategy can rapidly implement changes .\nHowever , there are disadvantages to such an autocratic approach relative to the more chaotic , bottom-up approach of developing energy systems in the U.S .\nYes , making changes to an electric utility system in the U.S. must confront permitting , regulations , public approval , litigation , delays , cost overruns and an archaic financial model for electric utilities .\nHowever , the more bottom-up approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) provides many different opportunities to experiment and learn , thus producing in the end an evolution of electric power systems that may be more anti-fragile with a broader array of options .\nBottom line : Focus on the energy transition , not near-term CO emissions .\nClean is one of the major values , and the CO2 emissions will eventually reduce .\nOverall a more rapid transition will be facilitated if we don \u2019 t unduly focus on CO emissions and meeting near term emissions targets .", "author": "curryja", "url":

Craig & John Thuburn ( 2002 ) Nearly all the energy that powers the climate system and life on Earth comes from the sun .\nIncoming solar radiation is estimated at 173,000 TW .\nBy contrast geothermal heat flow from radiogenic decay and primordial heat is estimated at 47 TW , human production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy from the Moon and the Sun at 4 TW .\nOther sources of energy , like solar wind , solar particles , stellar light , moonlight , interplanetary dust , meteorites , or cosmic rays , are negligible .\nSolar irradiance , thus , constitutes over 99.9 % of the energy input to the climate system .\nThe energy received from the sun changes over the annual cycle by 6.9 % due to the changing Earth-Sun distance .\nThe Earth is closest to the sun ( perihelion ) around the 4th of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 4th of July .\nAlthough half the Earth is illuminated by the sun at any given time ( 50.2 % due to the difference in size ) , the changes in the Earth \u2019 s axis orientation towards the sun , the irregular distribution of land masses , changes in albedo , and regional changes in surface and atmosphere temperature , cause important seasonal changes in the amount of reflected solar shortwave radiation ( RSR ) and outgoing longwave radiation ( OLR ) .\nAs a result , the temperature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is never in energy balance .\nContrary to what could be naively expected , the Earth is warmest just after the June \u2019 s solstice , when it is farthest from the sun , and coldest just after the December \u2019 s solstice , when it is receiving 6.9 % more energy from the sun .\nEarth \u2019 s average surface temperature is c. 14.5 \u00b0C ( severe icehouse conditions ) , but during the year it warms and cools by 3.8 \u00b0C ( Fig .\n3.1 ) .\nAs expected , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiation , TOR ) when it is cooling and less when it is warming , regardless of what it is receiving at the time , so the idea of an energy balance at the top of the atmosphere ( TOA ) is clearly

the climate system does with that energy , and the climate system is extremely complex .\nAs Barry , et al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quote at the top of this part , modern climatology lacks a proper theory of how energy is moved within our planet \u2019 s climate system .\nIt is possible to model what it is not properly understood , even if very complex , but to believe such a model is foolish .\nThe energy from the sun comes in a straight line from its surface , as can be clearly appreciated during a total eclipse .\nThe sun has an apparent size of 0.5\u00b0 of arc in Earth \u2019 s sky and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s solar orbit , called the ecliptic .\nThe ecliptic is the projection of Earth \u2019 s orbital plane onto the sky , it is also the path the most vertical rays from the Sun make around the globe , at the local noon , during a 24-hour day .\nDue to Earth \u2019 s axial tilt , the sun is not always directly above the equator , and moves from being above 23.44\u00b0N at the June solstice to 23.44\u00b0S at the December solstice .\nThe position of the sun at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its radiation .\nAt a higher angle of incidence ( sun lower on the horizon ) the energy arriving from the sun is spread over a larger surface area , decreasing the amount of energy per unit of horizontal area .\nThe flux of solar radiation per unit of horizontal area for a given locality is the solar insolation , and it is higher at solar noon the closer in latitude to the declination of the sun , which marks the position of the ecliptic with respect to the equator .\nSolar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local surface temperature .\nAs a result of the position of the sun with respect to the Earth , most energy enters the climate system in the tropics .\nHowever , OLR increases with the absolute temperature of the surface , and decreases with the greenhouse effect , and cloud cover .\nAs the average absolute temperature of the surface does not vary that much with latitude ( 278\u2013300 K between

more incoming than outgoing ) on the annual average between c. 30\u00b0N-30\u00b0S and negative between c. 30\u00b0 and the pole .\nHowever , during the Dec-Feb season the net flux is negative north of 15\u00b0N ( Fig .\n3.2 ) , and most of the Northern Hemisphere is losing energy .\nThe resulting cooling from reduced insolation and a net energy deficit creates a latitudinal temperature gradient

is carried out by the atmosphere and the ocean along the temperature gradient and is variable over time .\nIt transports a lot more energy ( stronger MT ) in the winter hemisphere ( Fig .\n3.2 ) .\nIn

.\nThe Earth \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the latitudinal insolation gradient .\nEnthalpy ( energy adjusted for volume and pressure ) tends to move along the LTG from regions of higher to regions of lower enthalpy .\nThis is the basis of MT , but given the complexity of the climate system , it is far from a passive process that depends only on the temperature difference between the tropics and the poles .\nInstead , it is a highly regulated process that can drive more energy for a smaller temperature difference and less energy for a larger temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next part , MT has increased in the first two decades of the 21st century , despite the Arctic being warmer , reducing the LTG .\nWe know that the Earth \u2019 s LTG has varied a lot over the geological past of the planet .\nWe saw in Part I that Wladimir K\u00f6ppen , the Russo-German scientist who studied the sun-climate effect in the 19th century , established a climate classification that is still in use with modifications .\nClimate zones are defined in terms of temperature , precipitation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants and animals are restricted to a habitat with a narrow range of temperatures ; and some geological processes are also temperature dependent .\nUsing this type of information Christopher Scotese has mapped past climate history with his Paleomap Project ( 1 ) .\nThe information thus obtained allows him to geographically reconstruct half a dozen climate zones every few million years , and from that to reconstruct the changing LTG of the Earth \u2019 s past .\nScotese et al .\n( 2021 ) defines the climate and global temperatures of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is a fundamental climate variable .\nScotese defines the present ( 21st century ) LTG and global temperature as severe icehouse conditions , as demonstrated by the massive permanent ice sheets over Antarctica and Greenland .\nThe existence of very different past climates of the Earth creates an unsurmountable problem for modern climatology .\nDuring the last glacial maximum ( LGM ) , 20,000 years ago , the energy received from the sun was the same as now .\nNot only that , but the precession and obliquity values were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eccentricity was very similar .\nThe distribution of solar energy over the Earth and the latitudinal insolation gradient were nearly identical to now , yet the climate was very different .\nEnergy input to the climate system must have been lower , because albedo was higher and the greenhouse effect lower .\nA lower energy input and a larger LTG ought to have drained the tropics of heat via a much stronger MT , but that was not the case .\nThere is still controversy about tropical temperatures during the LGM , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u00b0C colder than present ( Annan & Hargreaves 2015 ) .\nThis is consistent with evidence presented by Scotese et al .\n( 2021 ) that tropical temperatures have not changed much over the course of the past 540 million years despite huge changes in the average temperature of the planet ( 9\u201330 \u00b0C ) .\nIf the LGM creates a problem for how MT operates during a glacial period , the equable climate of the early Eocene results in a paradox that modern climatology can not solve .\nCurrently the Earth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very steep LTG .\nTemperature falls by 0.6\u20131 \u00b0C/\u00b0latitude from the equator to the winter pole .\nSuch cold or colder conditions as of today have been relatively rare during the past 540 Myr ( less than 10 % of the time ) .\nThe early Eocene Earth had an average temperature estimated at 23.8 \u00b0C , that Scotese describes as hothouse conditions .\nThe early Eocene LTG was very shallow , at 0.25\u20130.45 \u00b0C/\u00b0latitude , with temperatures at the North Pole above freezing all

.\nThe failure of modern climate theory to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c equable climate problem \u201d ( Huber & Caballero 2011 ) .\nTo reproduce the early Eocene warm continental interior temperatures and above freezing winter high latitudes , models have to raise CO levels to 4700 ppm and tropical temperatures to 35 \u00b0C .\nHowever , the best CO estimates for the early Eocene climatic optimum ( Beerling & Royer 2011 ; Steinthorsdottir et al .\n2019 ) place CO levels at 500\u20131000 ppm , and it is unclear that a tropical temperature above 30 \u00b0C is possible .\nThe survivability wet-bulb temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which point they become unable to lose heat ( Sherwood & Huber 2010 ) .\nThe highest wet-bulb temperature on Earth today is 30 \u00b0C , and there is no reason to think that it has been higher at any time in the past at places where mammal fossils are found .\nAt the root of the equable climate problem lies the \u201c low gradient paradox \u201d ( Huber & Caballero 2011 ) .\nConceptually , we believe that to have warm poles more heat must be transported there , to compensate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a very important part of the planetary energy budget , and it is generally believed that without it the poles would be much colder .\nBut MT depends on the LTG since much of the poleward transport in the present climate is through atmospheric eddies resulting from baroclinic ( where temperature gradients exist at constant pressure surfaces ) instability .\nThe paradox arises because , counterintuitively , the warm poles of the early Eocene and their much shallower LTG imply a reduced MT .\nIt is no wonder that climate models have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Part VI a possible solution to the paradox will be offered .\n3.3 Meridional transport is mainly carried out by the atmosphere The lower atmosphere is a thin film of gas , just 1/600 of the Earth diameter ( c. 10 km ) , that has the crucial role of always maintaining a land surface temperature compatible with complex life , something it has done for at least the past 540 Myr .\nTo do that it has to compensate for surface temperature differences arising from differences in insolation .\nFirst , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night .\nIt does so mainly through the greenhouse effect that reduces night cooling , and through the effect of clouds , that increase albedo during the day and reduce night cooling .\nThen , it must compensate for the latitudinal decrease in insolation and its seasonal changes due to the axial tilt of the planet .\nIt does so through meridional heat transport .\nOf these three factors responsible for Earth \u2019 s thermal homeostasis , greenhouse effect , clouds , and MT , modern climatology has focused exclusively on the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d climate hypothesis ( Lacis et al .\n2010 ) .\nThe effect of clouds and their variability on climate change is still largely unknown .\nWith respect to MT , and as figure 3.2 suggests , energy is only exchanged between the climate system and the outside through the TOA , this results in MT necessarily having a net zero value when integrated over the climate system .\nMoving energy from one region to another does not alter the amount of energy within the system .\nThis fact has resulted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not constitute a significant cause for climate change , producing the most fundamental mistake of modern climatology .\nThe atmosphere has the outstanding capacity of moving a great amount of energy , fast and efficiently , over the entire surface of the Earth .\nAs a result , MT is carried out mainly by the atmosphere .\nOnly within the deep tropics ( 10\u00b0S\u201310\u00b0N ) the atmosphere is inadequate for MT requirements .\nThis is the region where most energy enters the climate system ( Fig .\n3.4 black dashed line ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch transports dry static heat ( sensible + geopotential ; Fig .\n3.4 red dotted line ) poleward , and this is partly compensated for by the lower branch \u2019 s equatorward transport of latent heat ( Fig .\n3.4 red dashed line ) .\nDue to this , the ocean must carry out most of the heat transport in the deep tropics .\nHowever , the ocean is less efficient at transporting heat than the atmosphere and the energy transport required in the tropics is very large , particularly in the Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the answer to this problem , as El Ni\u00f1o is the way to periodically transport out of the deep tropics the excess accumulated heat that the regular MT can not carry .\nENSO is part of the global MT system .\nFig .\n3.4 .\nMeridional transport

dashed line , CERES TOA net radiation flux in Watts/m2 , positive is net inflow , or warming .\nAfter Randall 2015 .\nOnce outside of the Hadley cell reach , the ocean transfers most of the energy it transports to the atmosphere , particularly at the western ocean basin boundary currents in the mid-latitudes , and poleward latent heat atmospheric transport becomes important .\nIn summary , most of the energy enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tropical oceans , it is then transported outside the deep tropics mostly by the oceans and ENSO , and most of the energy is then transferred to the atmosphere that does the bulk of the transport in the middle and high latitudes .\nOnce the sea-ice edge is reached , the transport is essentially carried out exclusively by the atmosphere , as the energy flux through the sea ice is much less than from the liquid ocean surface .\nExcluding solar radiation , the rest of the energy flux across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly everywhere at every time , except for some high latitude regions during the summer ( Yu & Weller 2007 ) .\nSea-surface temperature is not as important for ocean-atmosphere energy flux as wind speed and air moisture , the principal factors governing evaporation .\nFigure 3.4 shows that MT is asymmetric .\nPoleward transport at the equator line is near zero , with a small inter-hemispheric transport ( 0.2 PW northward ) .\nThe position of the inter-tropical convergence zone ( ITCZ , the climatic equator that separates the North and South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 30\u00b0N , and has an annual mean position c. 6\u00b0N .\nPoleward transport increases with distance from the equator as heat from a bigger region is transported poleward .\nNorthern Hemisphere ( NH ) MT is bigger because northern oceanic MT is bigger .\nThis is due to a northward inter-hemispheric ocean MT of 0.4 PW , mainly through the Atlantic Ocean , compensated in part by a southward inter-hemispheric MT of 0.2 PW by the atmosphere from the ITCZ ( Marshall et al .\n2013 ) .\nPoleward of 45\u00b0 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern , due to a larger sensible heat transport by eddies , particularly during winter .\nThis transport reflects a larger ocean-atmosphere flux at the western boundary mid-latitude currents ( Yu & Weller 2007 ) , that is responsible for a warmer winter climate in the European mid-latitudes and for Arctic winter warming .\nAs we can also see in figure 3.4 , 70\u201390\u00b0 TOA net radiation is more negative in the Arctic than in Antarctica .\nThis is the obvious result of transporting more heat to the Arctic in winter .\nTransport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the transport of mass , momentum , chemicals , moisture , and clouds .\nIt takes place in the troposphere , mainly along preferred routes over ocean basins , and in the stratosphere .\nAs we saw in section 2.5 , angular momentum is exchanged between the solid Earth\u2013ocean and the atmosphere .\nIn low latitudes , surface winds are easterly and flow in the opposite direction to the rotation of the Earth , so the atmosphere gains momentum through friction with the solid Earth\u2013ocean that reduces its speed of rotation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ westerly and the atmosphere loses momentum to the solid Earth\u2013ocean that increases its speed of rotation , so a poleward atmospheric flux of angular momentum is required to conserve momentum and maintain the speed of rotation .\nFig .\n3.5 .\nMeridional transport of energy ( left ) and angular momentum ( right ) implied by the observed state of the atmosphere .\nIn the energy budget there is a net radiative gain in the tropics and a net loss at high latitudes ; to balance the energy budget at each latitude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the angular momentum budget , the atmosphere gains angular momentum in low latitudes due to easterly surface winds and loses it in the middle latitudes due to westerly surface winds .\nA poleward atmospheric flux of angular momentum is implied .\nMeridional transport of energy and momentum is known to be modulated by ENSO , the quasi-biennial oscillation and solar activity .\nAfter Marshall & Plumb 2008 Changes in the atmospheric angular momentum ( AAM ) must be balanced by changes in the speed of rotation of the solid Earth\u2013ocean to preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the seasonal changes in the zonal wind circulation .\nZonal wind circulation is stronger in winter , when more angular momentum resides in the atmosphere due to a deeper LTG , so the Earth rotates faster in January and July , and slower in April and October , when zonal circulation is weaker .\nAs mentioned in Part II , these small changes in the rate of rotation of the Earth are measured as micro-second changes in the length-of-day ( \u2206LOD ) , the difference between the duration of the day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in \u2206LOD reflects changes in zonal circulation ( Lambeck & Cazennave 1973 ) and , therefore , in MT .\nThe biennial component of \u2206LOD reflects changes in the QBO ( Lambeck & Hopgood 1981 ) , the 3\u20134-year component matches the ENSO signal ( Haas & Scherneck 2004 ) , and the decadal change in \u2206LOD reflects changes in solar activity ( Barlyaeva et al .\n2014 ) .\nThe Sun , QBO and ENSO constitute three factors modulating the coupling of the tropical stratosphere to the polar vortex ( PV ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moisture transport to the winter pole .\nSince they affect the zonal wind circulation it is not surprising to see they also affect the speed of rotation .\nBut while the role of ENSO and the QBO in changing the AAM and \u2206LOD is widely known and reported , the role of the sun remains largely ignored .\n3.4 Winter transport to the Arctic .\nThe biggest heat-sink of the planet It is believed that the hemispheric difference in temperature ( Fig .\n3.1 ) is due mainly to the larger land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of global landmass ) that warms and cools more than the ocean surface .\nThe answer is however more complex , as it also involves the asymmetry in MT ( Kang et al .\n2015 ) .\nAs we have seen , some of its consequences are the preferential location of the ITCZ in the NH , and a net inter-hemispheric heat transport from the SH to the NH .\nHemispheric transport asymmetry results also from the reduction in MT to the South Polar Cap , hindered by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolate Antarctica .\nThe result from these asymmetries is that despite the South Pole being much colder , more energy is transported to the North Pole ( Peixoto & Oort , 1992 ) .\nAs a result of its warmer atmosphere , the 70\u201390\u00b0N polar region loses c. 10 W/m2 more heat over the year than the 70\u201390\u00b0S polar region .\nThe loss is much bigger during the boreal winter , when the atmosphere transports 120 W/m2 across 70\u00b0N , than during the summer , when it transports 80 W/m2 ( Peixoto & @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transport is carried out by transient eddies and the mean meridional circulation , but the winter-summer difference is mostly due to stationary eddies along storm tracks that in winter are responsible for most of the increase ( Fig .\n3.6 ) .\nOver 80 % of the energy transported during the warm season to the north polar region is used to melt snow and ice , and warm the ocean .\nAbout two thirds of that energy constitutes energy storage that is returned to the atmosphere during the cold season cooling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs a result of these differences , the north polar region loses 20 % more energy than the south polar region during the respective winters , constituting the biggest heat-sink of the planet ( Fig .\n3.2 ) .\nFig .\n3.6 .\nJanuary northward heat flux by eddies .\nDuring boreal winter the NH subtropical jet has two maxima downstream of the Himalaya and Rocky Mountains over the Pacific and Atlantic oceans , respectively .\nThese wind speed maxima result in vigorous mid\u2013latitude cyclones following storm tracks that define the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 K m/s .\nBlue shading in the SH indicates southward flux .\nAfter Hartmann 2016 During winter , nearly all the energy lost at this heat-sink is transported there by the atmosphere , as the equilibrium temperature of sea water in contact with ice is practically constant regardless of the atmospheric temperature and sea-ice thickness .\nSea-ice constitutes a very good insulator ( K \u2248 2.2 W/m K ) .\nCompared to a loss of 310 W/m2 for exposed waters at a 30 \u00b0C temperature difference , a 2 m thick ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W/m2 ( Peixoto & Oort , 1992 ) .\nIt is clear that the great loss of winter sea-ice for the past 45 years constitutes a strong negative feedback on global warming .\nDry static ( sensible + geopotential ) heat is brought into the winter Arctic by both the middle ( 20\u2013100 km height ) and lower atmosphere , while latent heat ( moisture ) is transported almost exclusively by the lower atmosphere .\nFigure 3.7 shows NH winter atmospheric heat transport .\nUpper atmosphere transport is inter-hemispheric ; however , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass , making it irrelevant for energy considerations .\nThe stratosphere contains 15 % of the atmospheric mass , and its meridional transport is termed the Brewer\u2013Dobson circulation ( BDC ) .\nAir enters the stratosphere at the tropical pipe ( Fig .\n3.7 ) , through a cold region above the tropical tropopause where it loses most of its water vapor .\nIn the upper stratosphere the deep branch of the BDC is inter-hemispheric and moves toward the winter pole .\nIn the lower stratosphere , the shallow branch of the BDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stronger towards the winter pole .\nIn the middle and high latitudes , the BDC air descends through the tropopause toward the surface .\nThe BDC takes place through a meridional wind thermal balance established by the LTG and is powered by planetary and synoptic waves that release energy and momentum to the mean flow when they dissipate .\nFig .\n3.7 .\nSchematic of atmospheric circulation at the December solstice in a

eddies , and the rest by the mean residual circulation .\nAt the December solstice , regions North of 72\u00b0 are in polar night .\nFrom Vin\u00f3s 2022 The autumn cooling of the Arctic atmosphere causes the end of the summer polar anticyclone , as the pressure decreases and the easterly winds that prevent upward wave propagation are replaced by westerly winds .\nA pole-centered cyclone ( low pressure center with anti-clockwise rotating winds ) , known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then .\nThe winter westerly winds of the NH are so strong that they only allow vertical wave propagation to the stratosphere of planetary waves of the highest amplitude ( zonal wavenumber 1 and 2 ) .\nThe waves release their momentum and energy in an area of the stratosphere known as the \u201c surf-zone \u201d ( McIntyre & Palmer 1984 ) .\nThe effect on the zonal mean circulation is a deceleration of westerly winds disrupting the thermal structure .\nAs the LTG can not be maintained under weaker westerly

the opposite happens and temperature at 30 km above the Arctic can become as low as \u201380 \u00b0C .\nNorthward of 20\u00b0N the atmosphere becomes the main carrier of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heat is transported to the Arctic mainly by stationary eddies ( planetary waves ) and transient eddies ( cyclones ) .\nCyclones preferentially generate , propagate and dissipate in storm tracks and tend to

cyclones poleward ( Woods et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence , a great part of the latent heat transported into the Arctic is the result of a limited number of weather systems that enter the Arctic mainly through a North Atlantic gateway ( 300\u201360\u00b0E ) , followed in importance by a North Pacific gateway ( 150\u2013230\u00b0E ) , and a less important Siberian one ( 60\u2013130\u00b0E ; Mewes &

examine the phenomenon of Arctic amplification .\nGeneral circulation models have been predicting polar amplification as a result of global warming since their beginnings .\nAfter all , as seen in figure 3.3 , as the climate of the Earth changes the change in temperature is larger the higher the latitude .\nHowever , in modern global warming Antarctic amplification has not been observed , and by 1995 so little Arctic amplification had been observed despite intense global warming the previous 20 years , that Curry et al .\n( 1996 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of observed warming and relatively small ice retreat may indicate that GCMs are overemphasizing the sensitivity of climate to high-latitude processes.\n\u201d That was about to change that year when Arctic amplification suddenly accelerated ( Fig .\n3.9 ) .\nBut the question is still valid .\nWhy was Arctic amplification small before 1996 , when intense global warming was taking place , and large after 1996 when global warming rate decreased ( the pause ) ?\nModern climatology does not have an answer to that .\nFig .\n3.9 .\nArctic seasonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( June\u2013August ) mean temperature anomaly calculated from the

e.g.\n, Fig .\n3.2 ) , the Arctic in winter constitutes the biggest heat-sink ( net energy loss to space ) in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.5 cm in summer , but in winter it drops to c. 0.2 cm ( Wang & Key , 2005 ) , the lowest value outside Antarctica .\nAs a result , cloud cover becomes lower in winter increasing the energy loss .\nWith a reduced cloud cover , almost no water vapor , and no albedo effect , the Arctic in winter has essentially no feedbacks to the greenhouse effect from CO .\nEven more , van Wijngaarden & Happer ( 2020 ) , note that \u201c the relatively warm greenhouse-gas molecules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause the Earth to radiate more heat to space from the poles than it could without greenhouse gases.\n\u201d It is clear that Arctic amplification is the consequence of an increase in MT , as the Arctic has a negative annual energy budget and the increase in greenhouse effect does not make it less negative .\nThe warming in the Arctic , particularly during the winter , can only come from an increase in the heat transported from lower latitudes .\nThe increase in Arctic heat transport that is not exported back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and increased downward longwave radiation .\nThe enhanced downward radiation increases surface temperature , but due to the low thermal conductivity of ice , and since the heat flux always goes from the warmer ocean to the atmosphere during winter , temperature inversions commonly result , often accompanied by humidity inversions , and the radiative cooling continues from the top of the inversion or the top of the clouds until the water vapor freezes and precipitates , restoring the original very cold condition ( Fig .\n3.8a ) .\nArctic winter heat transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions prevail over the pole leading to a weak or split vortex .\nWarm air then enters the central Arctic ascending over the cold air ( isentropic lifting ) , pushing it outwards .\nAs a result , cold Arctic air masses then move over the mid\u2013latitude continents producing anomalously cold temperatures and snow .\nSince Arctic amplification started , the frequency of mid-latitude cold winters has increased , something that models can not explain ( Cohen et al .\n2020 ) , but something similar took place between 1920\u201340 ( Chen et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part we have reviewed how the LTG constitutes the most fundamental climate variable , and the mechanisms by which it drives the MT of energy towards the poles .\nIn the next part we will review what happens when those mechanisms change in a coordinated way , as it

1984 discovery of the first multidecadal oscillation , the primary global climate internal variability phenomenon , by Folland et al .\nThe impact of this fundamental feature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later by Schlesinger and Ramankutty ( 1994 ) , after modern global warming had already been blamed on CO changes , illustrating the risk of reaching a consensus with insufficient understanding of the topic at hand .\nThe Pacific ( inter ) Decadal Oscillation ( PDO ) was discovered three years later ( Mantua et al .\n1997 ; Minobe 1997 ) .\nThe Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation ( AMO ) was not named until just two decades ago ( Kerr 2000 ) .\nPrior to the 1980s , it was generally thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be almost imperceptible during the span of a human lifetime .\nBut then it became clear that abrupt climate changes took place during the past glacial period ( Dansgaard et al .\n1984 ) , Dansgaard\u2013Oeschger events demonstrated that regional , hemispheric , and even global climate could undergo drastic changes in a matter of decades .\nThe problem was that modern climate-change theory was built around gradual changes in the greenhouse effect ( GHE ) and did not have much room for abrupt , drastic , global changes that could not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( GHG ) radiative forcing .\nThe first explanations for glacial Dansgaard\u2013Oeschger events involved drastic changes in meridional transport ( MT ) by the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation ( AMOC ) .\nAMOC is part of the global conveyor theory that tries to explain the flow of heat through the Earth \u2019 s oceans .\nThe AMOC explanation , better known as the salt-oscillator hypothesis ( Broecker et al .\n1990 ) , falls short however , as there is no evidence that the AMOC has undergone the abrupt and drastic changes required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory on MT is based on what is known as the Bjerkness compensation hypothesis , where changes in one of MT components ( the oceanic or the atmospheric ) are compensated for by similar changes of the opposite sign in the other .\nCurrent interpretations of the Dansgaard\u2013Oeschger phenomenon are based on rapid sea-ice changes taking place at the Nordic seas that abruptly released a great amount of ocean-stored heat under the sea-ice ( Dokken et al .\n2013 ) .\nDansgaard\u2013Oeschger events have turned out to be a glacial-world phenomenon with little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clear that abrupt climate changes are a reality that requires an explanation .\nStudies of Holocene climate change have identified at least 23 abrupt climate events ( Fig .\n4.1e ; Vin\u00f3s 2022 ) during the past 11,700 years ( about two per millennium on average ) .\nThey are well reflected in several proxies of different nature and identified as such in the paleoclimatic literature .\nFrom their different climatic signatures , it is clear that these events can not respond to a single cause .\nYet modern climate-change theory has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in radiative forcing produced by changes in atmospheric GHGs , or volcanic activity .\nThese simple processes can not explain them all .\nChanges in CO can be ruled out as a cause , since from 11,000 years ago to 1914 it remained between 250 and 300 ppm , and decadal to centennial oscillations in CO have only varied a few ppm according to ice cores .\nVolcanic forcing presents a problem , because its Holocene evolution has been opposite to temperature evolution .\nIt was stronger when the planet warmed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum c. 3,000 years ago , so it can not be a strong driver of centennial temperature change .\nIn fact , the Little Ice Age ( LIA ) , the most recent abrupt climate event prior to modern global warming , can not be explained by CO or volcanic forcing .\nAccording to the GISP2 ice core volcanic sulfate record ( Fig .\n4.1c ; Zielinski et al .\n1996 ) , volcanic activity was above average between 1166\u20131345 AD , but was below during most of the LIA , only becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the 1766\u20131833 AD period .\nFig .\n4.1 Abrupt climate change during the Holocene .\na ) Black curve , global temperature reconstruction from 73 proxies (

abundance changes in Gulf of Oman eolian deposition record ( Cullen et al .\n2000 ) .\nDark grey boxes at bottom give their approximate dates in ka .\nAfter Vin\u00f3s 2022 Modern climate theory has a problem explaining abrupt climate change and has developed a vague explanation that uses concepts from chaos theory about thresholds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reached when a forcing gradually increases over a noisy chaotic background .\nThe problem is that there is no evidence for the existence of such thresholds and tipping points other than the existence of the abrupt climate changes that they try to explain .\nTheoretical positive feedbacks are also invoked , but the general climate stability that has been life-compatible for the past 450 Myr indicates that it is a system dominated by negative feedbacks .\nAs is usually the case with a troubled paradigm , it takes refuge on the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance of the poorly measured themohaline circulation for climate change , finding some support in general circulation models , but not on the evidence , that suggests AMOC is a lot more stable than previously thought ( Worthington et al .\n2021 ) , and does not appear to depend much on deep water formation ( Lozier 2012 ) .\nBesides abrupt climate events that took place centuries or millennia ago , current climate also undergoes rapid regime shifts every few decades .\nThe regime shift concept was developed in ecology to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly in grazing ecosystems .\nLluch-Belda et al .\n( 1989 ) used the concept to explain the alternation between sardine and anchovy regimes simultaneously in several of the world oceans , possibly in response to climate change .\nTheir data showed that at least two shifts between sardine and anchovy regimes had taken place during the 20th century prior to the 1980s .\nAt the 1990 7th Annual Pacific Climate Workshop , Ebbesmeyer et al .\n( 1991 ) presented a study demonstrating that in 1976 the Pacific climate had undergone a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including air and water temperatures , the Southern Oscillation , chlorophyll , geese , salmon , crabs , glaciers , atmospheric dust , coral , carbon dioxide , winds , ice cover , and Bering Strait transport .\nThe changes suggested that one of Earth \u2019 s largest ecosystems occasionally undergoes abrupt shifts .\nNicholas Graham ( 1994 ) analyzed the abrupt changes that took place in the boreal winter circulation over the Northern Hemisphere ( NH ) and in the coupled ocean/atmosphere system of the tropical Pacific and concluded that these changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that began when the coupled ocean-atmosphere system did not recover fully from the 1976-77 El Ni\u00f1o , and were best described as a change in the background climate state .\nIn addition , mid-latitude winter boreal circulation became more vigorous , with a southward excursion of the westerlies , significant changes in geopotential heights and sea level pressure , accompanied by a southward migration of the Aleutian low-pressure center in winter .\nExamination of past climate and fishery data from the North Pacific by Mantua et al .\n( 1997 ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the identification of a 50\u201370-year climate oscillation that was named the Pacific ( inter ) Decadal Oscillation ( PDO ; Mantua et al .\n1997 ) .\nRegime shifts in the PDO were identified in both articles c. 1925 , 1947 , and 1977 .\nThe pan-Pacific coordinated changes in climate and ecological variables were apparent in many sea-surface temperature ( SST ) and sea-level pressure ( SLP ) indices , like the Southern Oscillation Index , defined by Gilbert Walker in the 1920s , and known since the 1960s to track atmospheric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMantua and Hare defined the PDO as the leading principal component of an empirical orthogonal function of monthly SST anomalies over the North Pacific ( poleward of 20\u00b0N ; Mantua & Hare 2002 ) .\nAs changes in SLP lead changes in SST by about two months , Shoshiro Minobe ( 1999 ) focused on SLP , using the North Pacific Index ( Trenberth & Hurrell 1994 ) that tracks seasonal SLP changes in an ample region of the North Pacific centered on the Aleutian Low .\nUsing this index , Minobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate shifts .\nThe major oscillation , already identified , had a period of c. 55 years .\nIt affected SLP variability during both winter and spring atmospheric circulation , and presented shifts at c. 1922/23 , 1948/49 and 1975/76 ( Minobe 1999 ) .\nThe minor oscillation had a period of c. 18 years , and only affected winter circulation .\nThree periods of the minor oscillation ( i.e.\n, shifts at c.1923/24 , 1946/47 and 1976/77 ) nearly coincide in time and sign with pressure changes of the major oscillation ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4.2 Multidecadal and bidecadal oscillations in the North Pacific .\na ) The wavelet-transform coefficient of the winter North Pacific index as the area-averaged sea-level pressure anomaly ( hPa ) in the region

amplitude of the changes ( color scale , hPa ) of the pressure changes in a region centered in the Aleutian Low .\nBlue color indicates a deeper Aleutian Low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin black-solid , black-dashed and grey contours indicate the significance at the 95 , 90 and 80 % confidence levels , respectively .\nFrom Minobe 1999. b ) The phase and amplitude sine wave of the diurnal lunar nodal cycle K1 tidal constituent ( thick black line , left scale ) has been overlaid to show that both the phase and period of the bidecadal component in the instrumental record is that of the 18.6-year lunar nodal cycle .\nAfter McKinnell and Crawford ( 2007 ) .\nc ) Vertical lines , dates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mantua et al .\n( 1997 ) The North Atlantic also presents a multidecadal oscillation , the AMO , and a bidecadal one ( Frankcombe et al .\n2010 ) .\nThe relationship between the bidecadal and multidecadal oscillations remains unclear .\nA subharmonic relationship is unlikely despite their coupling .\nIn the North Pacific they have a different seasonal dependency , and in the North Atlantic the bidecadal oscillation is best seen in subsurface temperatures , while the multidecadal one affects mainly surface temperature and Arctic deep-water salinity ( Frankcombe et al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2007 ) propose that the North Pacific bidecadal oscillation is a manifestation of the 18.6-year lunar nodal cycle in winter air and sea temperatures .\nThis lunar cycle strongly affects the magnitude of the lunar diurnal tide constituent ( K1 ) and is synchronized in phase and period to the bidecadal oscillation .\nIn Fig .\n4.2 increasing K1 ( upward sinusoidal ) is associated to decreasing SLP ( blue colors ) and decreasing K1 to increasing SLP .\nAccording to McKinnell and Crawford , the bidecadal component of variability association to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proxy temperatures of up to 400 years in duration .\nA tidal cause for the bidecadal oscillation certainly provides an explanation for the subsurface temperatures effect in the North Atlantic .\nTides provide over half of the energy for the vertical mixing of water in the oceans .\nThe work of Schlesinger and Ramankutty ( 1994 ) made clear that multidecadal variability had a global effect on temperature , that also displayed a c. 55\u201370-year oscillation when detrended .\nInterdecadal oscillations have been described in most oceans , including the Arctic , affecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , SLP , sea subsurface temperature , salinity , sea-ice , wind speed , sea-level , and atmospheric circulation .\nIt was necessary to take a global view integrating all this natural variability into a single hypothesis of global multidecadal internal climate change .\nThat is what Marcia Wyatt accomplished when she developed the \u201c stadium-wave \u201d hypothesis in her thesis ( Wyatt 2012 ) .\nShe identified a multidecadal climate signal that propagated across the Northern Hemisphere through indices of a synchronized network ( Fig .\n4.3 ) .\nWhile Wyatt could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the cause of its period of c. 64 years , Wyatt and Curry ( 2014 ) identified the Eurasian Arctic sea-ice region as the place where the signal was first generated .\nAs we saw in Part III , this is the main gateway for atmospheric winter meridional transport into the Arctic ( e.g.\n, see Figs .\n3.6 & 3.8b ) , to which sea-ice is very sensitive .\nFig .\n4.3 The stadium-wave hypothesis .\n20th-century signal propagation through a 15-index-member network .\nSelected indices are a sub-set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indices are highlighted ( \u00b1I through IV ) .\nEach cluster is termed a \u201c Temporal Group \u201d .\nPeak values of Group indices represent stages of climate-regime evolution .\nFrom Wyatt and Curry 2014 Clearly a hemispherically synchronized multidecadal variability in the ocean-atmosphere coupled system takes place in the NH during winter .\nMost modern global warming has also taken place since 1976 in the NH during the winter months ( Fig .\n4.4 ) .\nIt is obvious to anybody endowed with independent thinking that the climate shift that affected the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warming that mainly affected the NH winters since 1976 must be causally related .\nAt the very least , natural multidecadal variability must be responsible for an important part of the global warming experienced in the 1976\u20132000 period .\nYet by the time multidecadal warming and climate regime shifts were known to climatologists ( in the 1990s\u20132010s ) , modern climate theory had already played a trump card assigning the 1976 climate shift to aerosols .\nAs Tsonis et al .\n( 2007 ) state : \u201c The standard explanation for the post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of greenhouse gases overcame shortwave reflection effects due to aerosols .\nHowever , \u2026 the observations with this event , suggests an alternative hypothesis , namely that the climate shifted after the 1970s event to a different state of a warmer climate , which may be superimposed on an anthropogenic warming trend.\n\u201d Despite knowing this , modern climate theory has refused to incorporate the effect of climate shifts , that are poorly reproduced and never predicted by models .\nThis sets the theory up for failure as the same trump card can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift comes .\nCan the proponents of modern climate theory ignore a new shift ?\nOr will they recognize the theory \u2019 s shortcomings , after committing western economies to a profound decarbonization ?\nFig .\n4.4 Hemispheric seasonal rates of warming .\nNorthern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere average temperature anomaly for December-February ( continuous ) , March-May ( long dash ) , June-August ( short dash ) , and September-November ( dotted ) for the 1970\u20132000 period .\nData from Jones et al .\n2016 4.3 Despite everybody looking at climate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporate climate shifts to the modern climate theory is one of the reasons the climate shift that took place in 1997\u201398 ( 97CS ) was not noticed and properly described .\nAnother reason is that many of its effects were erroneously assigned to the increasing radiative forcing from GHGs climbing levels and used to raise the level of climate alarm .\nAs the 1976 shift changed the NH climate to a warmer state ( Tsonis et al .\n2007 ) by increasing the rate of warming ( Fig .\n4.4 ) , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate state by reducing the rate of warming .\nEmbarrassingly , it was not climate scientists who noticed this change , since it did not fit their biases with regard to increasing levels of GHGs , but a geologist and paleontologist skeptical of modern climate theory who first reported it : \u201c There IS a problem with global warming\u2026 it stopped in 1998 \u201d ( Carter 2006 ) .\nAfter the pause in global warming was identified , hundreds of articles were published on it in scientific journals and a great controversy erupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denying its existence ( Lewandowsky et al .\n2016 ) and even altering the official datasets to reduce its significance ( Karl et al .\n2015 ) , and other authors asserting it as a real phenomenon that needed an explanation ( Fyfe et al .\n2016 ) .\nThe pause controversy was a third factor obscuring recognition of the 97CS despite clear evidence of its existence .\nThis factor , together with the absence of climate shifts in modern climate theory and models , and the incorrect attribution of its effects to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion out of the mainstream .\nLluch-Belda et al .\n( 1989 ) identified global sardine and anchovy regime shifts suggesting a climate change cause .\nThese fishery shift points were later identified as Pacific climate shift points that had global teleconnections ( Mantua & Hare 2002 ) .\nChavez et al .\n( 2003 ) reported in the journal Science that a new multidecadal regime shift in Pacific fisheries had taken place in the mid-1990s .\nThe warm \u201c sardine regime \u201d had changed to a cool \u201c anchovy regime.\n\u201d The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that these large-scale , naturally occurring variations should be taken into account when considering human-induced climate change .\nThe 97CS continues to be unrecognized by climate scientists .\nThe next shift will probably occur in the late 2020s to early 2030s .\nIt would be shameful if climate scientists , at that time , are still unprepared for the change , and do not recognize multidecadal variability contribution to modern global warming .\n4.4 How the climate shifted globally at the 97CS Science is so specialized and compartmentalized these days that nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirms the 1997-98 global climate shift .\nA shift that is obviously unexplained by changes in GHGs levels and modern climate theory .\nSolar activity changed from high at solar cycle ( SC ) 22 to low at SC24 ( Fig .\n4.5a , black line ) .\nThis change can be better appreciated in the great decrease in the antipodal amplitude magnetic index ( Fig .\n4.5a , red line ) , that measures geomagnetic disturbances caused mainly by the solar wind , to centennial low values .\nWe have already mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig .\n4.5b ) , that can be better characterized as a reduction in the rate of global warming after the mid-1990s , and is still ongoing despite its interruption by the strong 2015\u201316 El Ni\u00f1o , after which no more warming has taken place , as of the middle of 2022 .\nAt the 97CS , a predominantly Ni\u00f1o frequency pattern in ENSO turned into predominantly Ni\u00f1a , as determined by the cumulative multivariate El Ni\u00f1o index ( MEI v.2 ) .\nThe summed index showed an increasing trend during the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shows a declining trend after ( Fig .\n4.5c , black line ) .\nWarm water volume at the equator decreased in variability ( Fig .\n4.5c , red line ) , and strongly negative anomalies in the warm water volume , that used to happen once a decade , stopped after 2000 .\nA westward shift in atmosphere-ocean variability in the tropical Pacific took place at the 97CS , characterized by a decrease of ENSO variability that coincides with the suppression of subsurface ocean temperature variability and a weakening of atmosphere-ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift manifested as more central Pacific versus eastern Pacific El Ni\u00f1o events , and a frequency increase in ENSO , linked to a westward shift of the location of the wind-SST interaction region ( Li et al .\n2019 ) .\nThe changes in the tropical Pacific atmosphere-ocean coupling had a reflection in the stratosphere .\nGlobal ( 60\u00b0N-S ) stratospheric water vapor decreased abruptly in 2001 ( Fig .\n4.5d ) .\nSimultaneously , the tropical tropopause cooled ( Randel & Park 2019 ) , indicating that a step change in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig

started increasing ( Goode & Pall\u00e9 2007 ) , due to increasing high and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995\u20132005 period a tropicalization of the climate took place and the tropics expanded as the Hadley cells increased their extent and intensity ( Fig .\n4.5f ; Nguyen et al .\n2013 ) .\nThe atmospheric angular momentum decreased causing the speed of rotation of the Earth to increase , reducing the length of the day by 2 ms ( Fig .\n4.5g ) .\nAll these changes altered the energetics of the climate system .\nThe Earth \u2019 s energy imbalance , the incoming solar radiation minus the total outgoing longwave radiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , started to decrease , ( Fig .\n4.5h , red line ; Dewitte et al .\n2019 ) .\nThe global energy change at the 97CS resulted in a change in trend in the ocean heat content ( OHC ) time derivative ( Fig .\n4.5h , black line ; Dewitte et al .\n2019 ) .\nThis change indicates OHC started to increase more slowly , which dismisses claims that the missing heat resulting from the pause in warming was going to the oceans ( Chen & Tung 2014 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate variables that display a rapid change at , or soon after , the climate regime shift identified by Chavez et al .\n( 2003 ) as a transition from a \u201c warm \u201d sardine to a \u201c cool \u201d anchovy regime , the opposite of the 1976 shift that was identified during the 1990s .\nTwenty-five years after the recognition of climate shifts , the 97CS has not been acknowledged by modern climate science .\nThat the 76CS has been recognized and the 97CS has not is a strong sign that modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change understanding and is causing scientists to dismiss facts that the theory can not explain .\nWhen the global climate shifted in 1997\u201398 , the Arctic climate was strongly affected .\nIn Part III , when reviewing how heat is transported during the winter to the Arctic , we mentioned that little Arctic amplification had taken place by 1995 despite two decades of intense warming , echoing the words of Curry et al .\n( 1996 ) : \u201c The relative lack of observed warming and relatively small ice retreat may indicate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to high-latitude processes.\n\u201d At the 97CS , Arctic amplification increased greatly and suddenly , but displayed a striking seasonality .\nArctic summer temperatures are not increasing ( Fig .\n4.6a , black line ) .\nAny increase in net heat transported in summer to the Arctic is in a great part stored , by warming the ocean and melting ice and snow , until the arrival of the cold season when it is returned to the atmosphere , by the reverse process .\nWinter surface temperature shows a very pronounced increase since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red line ) .\nThe effect of the 97CS on Arctic sea-ice extent was spectacular .\nBetween 1996 and 2007 September Arctic sea-ice extent decreased by a whopping 45 % ( Fig .\n4.6b ) , leading to fears among experts that it had entered a death-spiral ( Serreze 2010 ) .\nBut after 11 years of loses Arctic sea-ice adapted to the new regime and 14 years later September Arctic sea-ice extent was higher than in 2007 .\nSince sea-ice loss was used as a poster child of enhanced greenhouse warming and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm and money , it can not now be properly attributed to the 97CS without losing face .\nThe reduction in Arctic sea-ice was accompanied at the 97CS by an increase in Greenland meltwater flux ( Fig .\n4.6c , black line ) , and a decrease in Greenland ice-sheet mass balance ( Fig .\n4.6c , red line ) , that display the same dynamics of rapid change in the years after the

between cyclonic ( anti-clockwise ) and anticyclonic ( clockwise ) ocean circulation in the Arctic Beaufort gyre , with a period of 10\u201315 years .\nThe problem is that during the 97CS the oscillation stopped and the system got stuck in the anticyclonic regime , which leads to freshwater accumulation in the Arctic .\n1996 was the last cyclonic AOO year , as of late 2022 .\nProshutinsky has no explanation and the index stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became worried that the increasing Beaufort gyre freshwater accumulation is a \u201c ticking time bomb \u201d for climate .\nThe accumulation may lead to a salinity anomaly in the North Atlantic with a magnitude comparable to the Great Salinity Anomaly of the 1970s , that traveled the sub-polar gyre currents from 1968 to 1982 and may have contributed to the early 1970s cooling .\nAdditional unexplained changes in the Arctic climate at the 97CS include the increase in winter blocking events , particularly in the NH ( Fig .\n4.6e ) .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how blocking conditions stop the normal westerly zonal circulation at mid-latitudes during winter .\nThey have two outstanding effects .\nThey stabilize weather patterns for days over the same location , leading to extreme weather events in temperature and precipitation ; and they also greatly increase MT towards the Arctic since they deflect cyclones poleward .\nIt is clear , but not explained , that MT towards the Arctic increased at the 97CS , and this is the underlying cause of many of the changes observed afterward in the Arctic climate .\nEvidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moisture transport into the Arctic comes from the increase in planetary-scale latent heat transport ( Fig .\n4.6f ) , while synoptic scale latent heat transport decreased during winters , but increased during summers ( Rydsaa et al .\n2021 ) .\nThe increase in winter heat and moisture transport into the Arctic leads to higher cloud formation , which shifts the strongest radiative cooling from the surface to cloud tops , which are frequently warmer in winter due to temperature inversions .\nAt the sea-ice border , winter heat intrusions cause a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading to enhanced heat loss by the ocean until the ice forms again ( Woods & Caballero 2016 ) .\nArctic amplification has turned out to be mainly a cold season phenomenon that started between 1995\u20132000 for reasons unknown to most climate scientists and models .\nArctic amplification is dependent on changes in MT , and the rate of Arctic amplification appears to be opposite to the rate of global warming .\nFrom the effects of climate shifts it is evident that they affect the global MT system , and particularly the boreal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Part III , ENSO is a way of extracting surplus heat from the deep tropics that exceeds the regular oceanic transport system .\nAt the 97CS this need decreases as the Brewer-Dobson circulation ( BDC , the stratospheric MT ) becomes more active driving more heat out of the deep tropics , causing a cooling at the tropical tropopause that results in more stratospheric dehydration .\nAlso , meridional wind circulation becomes stronger at the expense of zonal circulation resulting in Earth \u2019 s rotation acceleration and Hadley cells expansion .\nAs meridional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the increase in meridional wind circulation , cloud cover decreases in the low and mid-latitudes , and increases in the Arctic .\nIn the Arctic the effects of climate shifts through changes in MT intensity are even more evident .\nAt the 97CS , MT to the Arctic was enhanced all year round , but more strongly during the cold season .\nThe rise in heat and moisture advection from lower latitudes results in a reduction in sea-ice cover that augments ocean heat loss , and increases cold season ( but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of winter warming is to increase the radiative loss to space .\nAs we saw in Part III , the Arctic in winter is very special in terms of GHE .\nThe atmosphere is extremely dry , so there is little water vapor GHE .\nCloud cover is also quite low during the winter , and the increase in CO has the effect of increasing radiation to space from warmer , higher CO molecules ( van Wijngaarden & Happer 2020 ) .\nWhen there is an intense intrusion event of moist warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual result is a temperature inversion , and despite increased downward longwave radiation , radiative cooling continues from the top of the inversion or the clouds until the advected moisture is either precipitated or exported back to lower latitudes .\nIn essence , more heat transported to the Arctic in the winter must result in more heat lost to space .\nThis conclusion contradicts one of the basic pillars of modern climate theory that states that MT is not a climate forcing since horizontal transport does not affect the amount of energy within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a cause for climate change .\nThis is the most fundamental of the many mistakes of modern climate theory , as it assumes the top of the atmosphere behaves similarly in terms of GHE everywhere .\nIt does not , as the GHE is very weak at the polar regions , particularly during the long cold season .\nTransporting more heat from a region of high GHE to a region of low GHE results in more heat being lost at the top of the atmosphere without a compensating gain elsewhere .\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter pole results in a change in the planet \u2019 s energy budget as we have shown ( Fig .\n4.5h ) .\nFig .\n4.7 Arctic region outgoing longwave radiation change .\nThin grey line , 7-month average of the monthly mean

.\nFrom Vin\u00f3s 2022 OLR in the Arctic is higher during the summer than during the cold season as could be expected from the near permanent summer insolation and higher surface temperature .\nHowever , at the 97CS OLR increased a lot more during the cold season than during the summer ( Fig .\n4.7 ) .\nClearly MT became stronger , particularly during the boreal winter .\nIncreased summer transport resulted in more energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refreezing of the melted water returns the summer energy to the atmosphere , only to be lost to space through radiative cooling .\nNow we understand why Arctic amplification is a winter phenomenon that is not related to global warming , and in fact is where the energy for the \u201c Pause \u201d is going .\nArctic amplification is not a GHG effect , but a MT effect that results in planetary cooling .\nThe pause is continuing because Arctic amplification is ongoing .\nWhen the pause ends the Arctic should cool and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously this could happen by late 2020s to early 2030s , when the next climate shift occurs .\nTo analyze the multidecadal changes in MT since 1900 , the 1912\u20132008 period has been subjectively divided in three phases of 32 years .\nAlthough the different modes of variability do not shift simultaneously ( hence the name stadium-wave ) , the phases so defined describe periods of alternating prevailing conditions in MT well .\nStarting in the Arctic , where the PV strength determines the polar stratosphere-troposphere winter coupling , the Arctic oscillation ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line ) is the leading mode of extratropical circulation variability in the NH ( Thompson & Wallace 2000 ) .\nTo act as a North-South seesaw of atmospheric mass exchange between the Arctic and mid-latitudes , the AO requires a correlation between its three centers of action \u2014the Arctic , Atlantic and Pacific sectors .\nThe Arctic-Atlantic correlation is known as the North Atlantic oscillation ( NAO ) , and is strong , but the Arctic\u2013Pacific linkage is weaker , casting doubts about the AO being a true annular mode .\nHowever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a negative correlation from one winter to the next since the mid-1970s ( Honda & Nakamura 2001 ) .\nThis Aleutian\u2013Icelandic seesaw appears to depend on the propagation of stationary waves and varies in strength with changes in PV strength ( Sun & Tan 2013 ) .\nBy calculating the Jan\u2013Feb cumulative AO ( Fig .\n4.8a , grey line ) we can see that until c. 1940 positive AO values ( i.e.\n, strong vortex conditions ) prevailed , but in the 1940\u20131980s period negative AO values were more common , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aleutian\u2013Icelandic seesaw confirms the changes in PV strength with its 25-year moving correlation ( Li et al .\n2018 ;

strong PV conditions ( Fig .\n4.8b , black line ) .\nThe NAO is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic , and part of the AO .\nNot surprisingly , its detrended and cumulative value is very similar to that of the AO , but also shows some correlation to the AMO SSTs ( Fig .\n4.8b , grey line ) .\nThe decades-long NAO trends can not be explained by general circulation models as they do not incorporate multidecadal MT regimes .\nModels consider NAO indices white noise without serial correlation ( Eade et al .\n2021 ) .\nWithout properly representing MT , climate models can not explain climate change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PDO also measures SST anomalies .\nA positive PDO indicates warm water accumulation over the equatorial and eastern side of the Pacific , an indication of reduced MT , which moves heat out of the equator and towards the western Pacific boundary so the Kuroshio current can move it northward and transfer it to the atmosphere .\nThe detrended cumulative PDO values ( Fig .\n4.8c ) show that the phases of increased or decreased Pacific MT roughly coincide with those of the Atlantic .\nClimatic and ecological shifts in the Pacific identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1997 ( Mantua & Hare 2002 ) coincide with times when the PDO shifts from predominantly positive to negative or back ( Fig .\n4.8c black dots ) .\nThe meridional wind circulation is how most of the tropospheric MT is carried out and increases in MT imply increases in meridional circulation and corresponding decreases in zonal circulation .\nThe atmospheric circulation index is a cumulative representation of the yearly anomaly in zonal ( E\u2013W ) versus meridional ( N\u2013S ) air-mass transfer in Eurasia ( Klyashtorin & Lyubushin 2007 ) .\nPeriods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and MT over the North Atlantic and North Pacific sectors has been lower ( grey areas in Fig .\n4.8 ) coincide with periods characterized by predominant zonal-type anomalies , while periods of weaker PV and higher MT present predominant anomalies of meridional-type ( Fig .\n4.8d , black line ) .\nThese persistent changes in predominant atmospheric circulation patterns produce changes in the transfer of momentum between the atmosphere and the solid Earth\u2013ocean affecting the Earth \u2019 s rotation speed , measured as changes in the length of day .\nPeriods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Earth and a decrease in \u2206LOD ( inverted in Fig .\n4.8d , grey line ) while periods of decreasing zonal circulation correlate with a deceleration of the Earth and an increase in \u2206LOD ( Lambeck & Cazenave 1976 ) .\nChanges in the rate of rotation of the Earth integrate global changes in atmospheric circulation that support the global effect of MT changes .\nWe must remember at this point that changes in Earth \u2019 s rotation rate respond to changes in solar activity ( see Fig .\n2.5 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of the multidecadal oscillation known as the stadium-wave , and all its manifestations .\nSST changes in the AMO and PDO are a response to changes in the global atmospheric circulation .\nA reduction in atmospheric meridional circulation and the corresponding increase in zonal circulation mean less poleward energy transport , and since annual incoming energy is near constant and ocean heat transport is only partially dependent on wind-driven circulation , more heat accumulates at each latitudinal band , but particularly at NH mid-latitudes .\nThis is because sea surface transfer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest at NH mid-latitude ocean western boundaries ( Yu & Weller 2007 ) .\nLand and sea surface heat accumulation resulting from a reduction in MT produces the stadium-wave effects and an increase in the global temperature .\nWhen the global average surface temperature anomaly is detrended , periods of reduced ( increased ) MT correspond to warming ( cooling ) with respect to the trend ( Fig .\n4.8e ) .\nThe modern climate theory explains the 1940\u20131975 hiatus as due to an increase in aerosols , and the 1976\u20132000 warming as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThese explanations , incorporated into climate models , are untenable in light of the evidence ( Tsonis et al .\n2007 ) .\nAlthough an anthropogenic warming trend is unquestionable , it is evident that the shifts in MT regimes dominate the surface temperature response .\nThe causes behind the multidecadal stadium-wave changes in MT are unknown .\nThe c. 65-year oscillation is non-stationary .\nProxy reconstructions indicate that the AMO had a shorter periodicity and less power during the LIA and a longer periodicity and more power during the Medieval Warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Wang et al .\n2017 ) .\nSolar activity modulation of ENSO and Earth \u2019 s rotation changes were shown in Part II ( Figs .\n2.4 & 2.5 ) .\nAs both are a manifestation of MT strength , it is possible that internal variability and external solar forcing are responsible for the current periodicity and strength of the stadium-wave .\nAlternatively , internal variability in MT might be responding to the warming trend imposed by anthropogenic and natural causes , mainly the increase in solar activity associated with the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified in the Pacific during the 20th century ( Mantua & Hare 2002 ) took place 1\u20133 years after a solar minimum ( Fig .\n4.8c & f , dots ; solar cycle , Fig .\n4.8f dashed line ) , and the two grey areas and middle white area in figure 4.8 , representing alternating MT regimes , span three solar cycles between solar minima .\nIt has been shown that the Holton\u2013Tan effect ( see Part I ) , that relates the tropical QBO phase to the strength of the PV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger at solar minima ( Labitzke et al .\n2006 ) , and that the Holton\u2013Tan effect weakened substantially during the 1977\u20131997 period of reduced MT ( Lu et al .\n2008 ) .\nThis implies that during winter at solar minima the stratospheric tropical-polar coupling , and the stratospheric-tropospheric coupling are stronger , and they might constitute an appropriate time for a coordinated shift in MT strength that takes effect during the ensuing solar cycle .\nWe shall see if future climate shifts also take place immediately following solar minima .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next climate shift could take place around 2031\u201334 .\nIf solar minima are the times when MT shifts occur , one interesting correlation may provide an explanation for the cause of the c. 65-year oscillation pacing .\nThe AMO has a 9.1-year strong frequency peak that is also found in the PDO ( Muller et al .\n2013 ) .\nThis frequency is readily appreciated in a 4.5-year averaged AMO index as decadal bumps ( Fig .\n4.8b , black curve ) .\nThe origin of this conspicuous AMO trait has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2010 ) convincingly proposes a lunisolar tidal origin .\nThe difference in frequency between this reported 9.1-yr tidal cycle and the 11-yr solar cycle is such that they change from correlated to anti-correlated ( i.e.\n, constructive to destructive interference ) with a periodicity that not only matches the AMO , but is exactly synchronized to it ( compare black curves in Fig .\n4.8b & f ) .\nOne can speculate that a constructive or destructive interference between the effect of oceanic and atmospheric tides on the tropospheric component of MT and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stratospheric component of MT might result in the periodical change in MT strength that produces the observed climatic shifts .\nIn support of this hypothesis two intrinsic components of c. 4.5 and 11 years are found in the Fourier analysis of the daily NAO autocorrelation series ( \u00c1lvarez\u2013Ram\u00edrez et al .\n2011 ) .\nThe 11-year component is phase synchronized to the solar cycle except during solar minima , indicating that NAO predictability increases with solar activity , and became strongly anti-correlated during the 1997 solar minimum , when the 97CS took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that depends on solar activity would explain both the changes in intensity and periodicity over the last centuries as solar activity has been changing .\nIts 20th century intensity and periodicity are the result of the modern solar maximum , and the non-stationarity of the natural multidecadal oscillation would be linked to solar activity multidecadal variability .\nIt can be argued that multidecadal oscillations in the climate system should average to zero over multiple periods .\nSimilarly , other factors known to affect MT , like the QBO and ENSO average to zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , AMO reconstructions show that its values and amplitude have increased greatly over the last two cycles , since about 1850 ( Moore et al .\n2017 ) .\nThis change in the c. 65-year oscillation suggests that MT is important in modern global warming , since it coincides with the strong melting of glaciers and increase in sea-level rise that started around 1850 and precedes the strong increase in CO emissions after 1945 ( Boden et al .\n2009 ) .\nSolar activity affects MT and does not average to zero even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centennial and millennial cycles ( Vin\u00f3s 2022 ) .\nThere has been a long-standing scientific debate about whether there is an important effect of solar activity on climate .\nSunspot records show that the average number of sunspots increased by 24 % from the 1700\u20131843 to the 1844\u20131996 period ( see Fig .\n1.6 ) .\nSolar variability is clearly involved in MT variability ( see Part II ) .\nThe effect that solar variability has on MT , and the effect that MT has on the planet \u2019 s energy imbalance ( @ @ @ @

concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together .\nThe best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period ( Figure SPM.3 ) \u201d ( IPCC 2014 ) .\nHowever , there is no evidence confirming this dogma .\nIt is based on computer model results that were programmed with the same assumptions that emerge from them , in a clear case of

MT cause climate regime shifts , and that these shifts alter the energy budget of the climate system .\nThis evidence refutes the dogma , revealing that changes in MT constitute a climate forcing not

and every one of the climatological factors affected by solar activity points to an effect of the variable sun on MT .\nThrough changes in MT , changes in solar activity constitute one of the main causes of climate change , further refuting the climate dogma .\nMT is the most important modulator of global climate .\nThe great complexity of the ocean-atmosphere coupled global circulation with all its modes of variability , oscillations , teleconnections , and modulations , is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the transport of energy from its climate system entry point to its exit point .\nMass ( including water ) is transported , directly or indirectly , because of energy transport .\nAs we saw in Part III , section 3 , MT is mainly carried out by the atmosphere ( see Fig .\n3.4 ) , and it does so through two separate but coupled tracks , one is through the stratosphere ( the Brewer\u2013Dobson circulation , BDC ) , the other is through the troposphere , mainly over ocean basins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe coupling of these two tracks is variable in time and space ( Kidston et al .\n2015 ) .\nAt the equatorial zone there is coupling through deep-convection and the ascending branch of the BDC ( Collimore et al .\n2003 ) , and at high latitudes through the polar vortex ( PV ) .\nThe downward coupling in the mid-latitudes is complex and variable by longitude ( Elsbury et al .\n2021 ) .\nThe downward coupling is mainly exerted by changes in stratospheric temperature gradients and the response of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thermal balance affects the strength of the mean zonal circulation , and the position and strength of tropospheric jets , eddies , and storm tracks ( Kidston et al .\n2015 ) .\nThe upward coupling depends on changes in convection and atmospheric wave generation .\nConsequently , the coupling is stronger in winter when temperature contrasts and atmospheric wave generation in the troposphere are more intense , and temperature gradients in the stratosphere are deeper .\nFig .\n5.2 .\nMeridional transport diagram .\nThe light-grey rounded rectangles are the two components @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their known modulators in white ovals .\nBlack arrows indicate coupling or modulation .\nDashed arrows indicate the indirect effect from volcanic eruptions on tropospheric meridional transport and ENSO.Changes in meridional transport affect the energy budget of the Earth \u2019 s climatic system by changing the energy transfer intensity from the GHG-rich tropical region to the GHG-poor polar region .\nFrom Vin\u00f3s 2022 .\nStratospheric MT is modulated by factors that alter the latitudinal temperature gradient ( ozone , solar activity , and volcanic aerosols ) , or the zonal wind strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the level of planetary wave transmission that powers stratospheric transport .\nENSO is part of the tropospheric MT and is determined by its conditions , but it is also a modulator of stratospheric transport , affecting the strength of the BDC ( Domeisen et al .\n2019 ) , and thus participates in the stratosphere-troposphere MT coupling .\nWhether the QBO influences ENSO is not known , but all other interactions between these three modulators ( solar effect , QBO and ENSO ) of stratospheric MT have been documented ( Labitzke 1987 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Callaghan 2000 ; Taguchi 2010 ) .\nThe stadium-wave represents the coordinated sequential change affecting the interconnected parts of tropospheric MT ( Wyatt & Curry 2014 ) .\nIt is a strong multidecadal oscillation in MT , and the importance it has on climate variability can not be overstated .\nMost of the climatic effects from volcanic activity that are not due to the direct reflection and scattering of solar radiation by stratospheric sulfate aerosols , or altered stratospheric chemistry , are accomplished by altering MT .\nThat is why strong tropical volcanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PV ( Gu\u00f0laugsd\u00d3ttir et al .\n2019 ) , why they induce ENSO states ( Swingedouw et al .\n2017 ; Sun et al .\n2018 ) , and why they excite the bidecadal MT oscillation ( Swingedouw et al .\n2015 ; see Part IV , Sect .\n4.2 & Fig .\n4.2 ) , accounting for the interdecadal effects of volcanic eruptions .\nOther than variations in the GHG content of the atmosphere , climate changes through changes in MT , and this is likely the main mechanism , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past with only modest variations in greenhouse radiative forcing .\nThe effect of some MT modulators trends to zero when averaged over a few years .\nThis is the case with QBO and ENSO .\nMultidecadal variability also balances out over longer time frames .\nHowever , solar activity has centennial and millennial cycles that become the most important MT modulator at sub-Milankovitch frequencies ( i.e.\n, < 10,000 years ) .\nThe Medieval Warm Period , centered c. 1100 , the Little Ice Age , centered c. 1600 , and the ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a millennial solar activity cycle , known as the Eddy cycle ( Abreu et al .\n2010 ) , that displayed high solar activity during the medieval and modern solar maxima ( c. 1150 & 1970 ) , and low solar activity at the Wolf , Sp\u00f6rer , and Maunder cluster of Solar Minima ( c. 1300\u20131700 ) .\nCentennial and millennial changes in solar activity are an important climate forcing because of the persistent effect they have on MT .\nSolar activity changes alter the global climate system energy budget .\nShorter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are less important because at these time frames MT becomes more affected by other modulators , like the stadium-wave , ENSO and the QBO , that quite often act in opposition to solar modulation .\nThe current view of climate change , as reflected in the IPCC assessment reports , constitutes a radiative theory of climate .\nWithin this theory , solar variability is only considered in terms of the small radiative changes in TSI ( about 0.1 % per solar cycle ) , despite strong evidence of solar-induced dynamical changes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThese non-linear , indirect , dynamical effects of solar variability on climate are detectable in climate reanalysis ( see Fig .\n2.2 ; Lean 2017 ) , and reproduced by models ( Kodera et al .\n2016 ) , yet they are not incorporated to the modern climate change theory because no room has been left for them .\nThe change in solar activity does not have a year-round global effect as expected from a global change in solar radiative forcing .\nThe effect is higher during hemispheric cold seasons , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown by its modifications to the Earth \u2019 s rotation speed ( see Fig .\n2.5 ; Le Mou\u00ebl et al .\n2010 ) .\nThe changes in the length of day ( \u0394LOD ) are due to changes in the meridional atmospheric circulation responsible for the increase in the amount of heat transported to the winter pole .\nThis cold-season specific solar effect , tied to the strength of the PV , is seen in climate reanalysis and observations suggesting it affects both atmospheric and oceanic phenomena , including the AO and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind strength , the sub-polar gyre strength , and the North Atlantic winter storm track .\nThe season-specific dynamical effect of solar activity must result in important changes in the amount of heat directed to the dark pole .\nMost of this heat exits the planet radiated as OLR in the long polar night .\nHeat flux across sea-ice is always towards the atmosphere , and the increase in non-condensing GHGs favors energy loss through higher radiative cooling from GHG molecules that are warmer than the surface ( van Wijngaarden & Happer 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the strong decrease in cloud cover that accompanies the polar winter ( Eastman & Warren 2010 ) , and the low absolute humidity of the winter polar atmosphere .\nThe seasonal asymmetric effect of solar activity on climate establishes solar variability as the most important long-term gatekeeper of the large amount of heat that leaves the planet at the poles every cold season .\nThey are the main heat sink for the planet ( see Fig .\n3.2 ) .\nThus , the hypothesis of how changes in solar activity regulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( WGK-h ) .\nThe WGK-h ( Fig .\n5.3 ) states that the level of solar activity is one of several factors that determine the strength of zonal winds and thus the propagation of planetary waves in the winter atmosphere .\nPoleward and upward wave propagation controls PV strength , which is the main modulator of heat and moisture MT to the winter pole .\nWinters of high solar activity promote stronger zonal circulation , reducing MT , leading to a colder Arctic winter , warmer mid-latitudes winter , a warmer tropical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lower energy loss at the winter pole .\nWinters of low solar activity promote the opposite .\nThe difference in energy loss at the winter pole is large enough to greatly affect the climate of the entire planet when solar activity is consistently high or low for several consecutive solar cycles ( i.e.\n, decades ) .\nFig .\n5.3 The Winter Gatekeeper hypothesis of solar variability effect on climate .\na ) High solar activity winters promote a strong stratospheric latitudinal temperature gradient through increased ozone and enhanced ozone heating caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity , through changes in the thermal wind balance , strengthens the zonal winds reducing planetary wave propagation .\nThis allows the polar vortex to remain strong through the winter , reducing meridional transport and heat loss at the winter pole .\nThe effect on the stratospheric temperature gradient from high solar activity can be opposed by easterly QBO and El Ni\u00f1o conditions .\nTropospheric meridional transport is strongly affected by the c. 65-year

cold Arctic/warm continents winter pattern .\nb ) Low solar activity winters promote a weak stratospheric latitudinal temperature gradient due to lower UV radiation , leading to a weak polar vortex that increases meridional transport and heat loss at the winter pole .\nThe effect on the stratospheric temperature gradient from low solar activity can be opposed by westerly QBO , La Ni\u00f1a conditions , and volcanic aerosol forcing .\nThe tropospheric meridional transport is strong when the c. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the AMO is changing to lower values ( heat reduction in the North Atlantic ) .\nIncreased transport increases Earth \u2019 s speed of rotation as zonal winds decrease , and less angular momentum resides in the atmosphere .\nThe climatic effect is reduced global warming and a warm Arctic/cold continents winter pattern .\nFrom Vin\u00f3s 2022 .\nThe WGK-h is based on the evidence that MT is one , if not the most important , agent for climate change .\nBut as stated previously , MT is modulated by climatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winds , including not only solar activity but also ENSO , the QBO , stratospheric volcanic aerosols , and the stadium-wave ( the multidecadal oscillation in tropospheric MT ) .\nAs MT depends on atmospheric and oceanic transport , it responds not only to the stratospheric signal that involves solar activity , but also to a tropospheric one that involves the ocean ( Fig .\n5.3 ) .\nThis double dependency leads to an inconsistency in solar effects that has plagued solar-climate studies .\nThe solar signal is part of a complex system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but its long turnover rate ( decadal to centennial ) accumulates over time .\nThe mechanisms for the solar effect on climate have been described by multiple authors .\nDifferential heating of ozone by UV , creates a temperature gradient in the stratosphere that affects zonal wind strength .\nThe strength of zonal winds determines planetary wave propagation that affects PV strength .\nZonal wind and PV conditions in the stratosphere propagate to the troposphere through thermal wind balance and stratosphere-troposphere coupling .\nAt the troposphere , the position and strength of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arctic Oscillation are affected ( Lean , 2017 ) .\nHowever , the WGK-h proposes that the long-term climatic effect of solar variability is mediated through its effect on the MT of heat towards the winter pole , and that the stronger global climatic effects are due to cumulative energy loss at the winter pole during prolonged periods of low solar activity .\nThe main role for solar variability in climate is to act as a winter gatekeeper , promoting energy conservation during years of high solar activity and allowing a higher energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs MT is geographically variable , the solar energy gatekeeping role has a stronger effect in the North Atlantic winter storm track and a smaller effect at the south polar cap , with the Pacific and Siberian Arctic winter gateways falling in between .\nThe WGK-h provides an explanation for the strong paleoclimatic effect of periods of prolonged low solar activity , like the Little Ice Age ( LIA ) , and its alternation with warmer periods like the MWP or Modern Global Warming that correspond to the c. 1000-yr Eddy solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proxies ( Marchitto et al .\n2010 ) .\nIt can also explain the North Atlantic region behavior as a climate variability hotspot .\nPaleoclimatologists have long noticed that many prominent climate change manifestations , such as Bond events , Dansgaard\u2013Oeschger events , Heinrich events , the MWP or the LIA are more prominent or exclusive to the North Atlantic region .\nThis region is a preferred corridor for MT and , thus , it is the area that is most sensitive to changes in it .\nThe WGK-h explains how the known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on atmospheric circulation ( i.e.\n, the top-down mechanism ; Matthes et al .\n2016 ) are responsible for an outsized longer-term modulation of climate change , through persistent changes in MT that alter the radiative properties of the planet .\nThe effect of solar variability on climate on a centennial to millennial timescale has long been established by paleoclimatology ( Engels & van Geel 2012 ) , but this knowledge could not be incorporated to our understanding of climate change because of the lack of a known mechanism .\nSolar variability during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cosmogenic isotope record ( mainly 14C and 10Be records ) .\nThe LIA is not the only secular period of the Holocene where an association can be established between persistently reduced solar activity in the form of solar grand minima ( SGM ) and a significant cooling in the Northern Hemisphere , together with a change in precipitation patterns that affected large regions , including the tropical monsoons ( Wang et al .\n2005b ) .\nAt c. 11.4 kyr BP the Pre-Boreal SGM coincides with the Pre-Boreal Oscillation ( Bj\u00f6rck et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10.3 kyr BP the Boreal 1 SGM coincides with the Boreal Oscillation 1 ( Bj\u00f6rck et al .\n2001 ) .\nAt c. 9.3 kyr BP the Boreal 2 cluster of SGM coincides with the Boreal Oscillation 2 ( Zhang et al .\n2018 ) .\nBetween 7.7 and 7.2 kyr BP a LIA-like period coincides with the Jericho cluster of SGM ( Berger et al .\n2016 ) .\nAt c. 6.3 kyr BP another period of low solar activity coincides with another climate pessimum ( Fleitmann et al .\n2007 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large global glacier advance that froze \u00d6tzi the iceman in the Alps coincided with the Sumerian cluster of SGM ( Thompson et al .\n2006 ) .\nAt c. 2.8 kyr BP , another climate pessimum identified with the Great Winter of the Bronze Age Nordic sagas ( Fries 1956 ) coincided with the Homeric SGM ( Chambers et al .\n2007 ) .\nAnd at c. 0.5 kyr BP the LIA coincided with the Wolf , Sp\u00f6rer , and Maunder cluster of SGM ( Kokfelt & Muscheler 2012 ) .\nTwenty-five SGM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Usoskin 2017 ) , but since 12 of them belong to 4 clusters , there are 17 periods of persistently reduced solar activity in 11,700 years .\nDespite the difficulties of studying the climate of past millennia , half of them have already been convincingly related to periods of profound climate worsening , in some cases associated with human population struggles ( see Fig .\n2.1 ; Bevan et al .\n2017 ) .\nIt is not surprising that so many paleoclimatologists are convinced solar variability has a profound effect on climate change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hu et al .\n2003 ; Engels & van Geel 2012 ; Magny et al .\n2013 ) .\nThe WGK-h requires that solar modulation of climate is accomplished by the top-down dynamical mechanism acting on MT .\nColin Hines conceived the bases of the top-down mechanism in 1974 , and the first evidence was published by Joanna Haigh in 1996 , incorporating the crucial role of ozone as the UV variability sensor and transmitter .\nSince then , the top-down mechanism has found support in observations , reanalysis , and modeling ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2017 ; Kodera et al .\n2016 ) .\nThe WGK-h links the top-down mechanism to the detected long-term effects of solar variability on climate through persistent modifications to the most important climate variable , the MT of energy from the tropics to the poles .\nThe WGK-h is supported by evidence of a solar effect on climate that is otherwise difficult to incorporate into alternate hypotheses .\nIt explains why the semi-annual component of the changes in the Earth \u2019 s speed of rotation , manifested as changes in the length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , responds to changes in solar activity ( Le Mou\u00ebl et al .\n2010 ) .\nThe LOD changes are a manifestation of the solar modulation of the winter atmospheric circulation .\nIt also explains why the multidecadal trend in \u2206LOD changes correlate with climatic changes ( Lambeck & Cazenave 1976 ; Mazzarella , 2013 ) .\nSolar modulation of ENSO ( see Part II ) also supports the WGK-h. Low solar activity promotes a stronger MT , favoring La Ni\u00f1a conditions at the equatorial Pacific , probably in response to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis is the opposite of tropical volcanic eruptions which produce a weaker MT and stronger PV , inducing El Ni\u00f1o conditions in the equatorial Pacific probably through a reduction in tropical upwelling by the opposite mechanism .\nThe warm Arctic/cold continents ( WACC ) winter pattern , linked to low solar activity ( Kobashi et al .\n2015 ; Porter et al .\n2019 ) , also constitutes evidence for the WGK-h. During prolonged periods of low solar activity , the Arctic is characterized by warmer winters , while the mid-latitude continents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incursions of polar air masses .\nThe opposite happens during prolonged periods of high solar activity , explaining why Arctic sea-ice initiated a great reduction at the climatic shift of 1997 ( see Part IV ) and not during the previous decades of prominent global warming .\nArctic amplification since 2000 manifests as a cold season phenomenon , with little summer temperature increase , supporting the underlying seasonal changes in MT that have taken place .\nAs required by the hypothesis , stratospheric planetary wave amplitude is modulated by solar activity ( Powell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.8 ) , with low solar activity resulting in increased planetary wave amplitude that should promote a stronger BDC and weaker PV .\nThe biennial oscillation ( BO ) changes the PV from a strong configuration one winter to a weak configuration the next ( Fig .\n5.4a ) .\nIt results from the solar cycle modulation of the QBO bimodality and its interaction with the strong polar annual variation ( Baldwin & Dunkerton 1998 ; Salby & Callaghan 2006 ; Christiansen 2010 ) .\nAfter the 1976\u201377 climate shift , the bimodality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resulting in a predominantly strong-vortex phase ( Fig .\n5.4a ; Christiansen 2010 ) .\nAt the 1997\u201398 climate shift , the bimodality in the QBO and the BO changed again to a stronger-bimodality weaker-vortex phase .\nThese climate shifts define the 1977\u201397 period when the effect of the QBO on the strength of the PV by the Holton\u2013Tan mechanism weakened considerably ( Lu et al .\n2008 ; see Part II ) .\nIn the 1970s , the QBO at 50 hPa , and extratropical winds at 54\u00b0N and 10 hPa @ @ @

westerly winds hinder the propagation of lower amplitude planetary waves .\nThe stronger PV that resulted from the high activity solar cycles 21 and 22 produced a slight cooling trend in winter Arctic

deviation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicating a surprising difference from the global warming experienced by most of the planet at the time , and in stark contrast to the polar amplification predicted by theory and the climate models .\nStarting in 1997 , the Arctic summer temperature anomaly displays a small decrease of about half a degree ( see Fig .\n4.6a ) , while the Arctic winter temperature anomaly shows a huge increase reaching +8 \u00b0C average during the 2017\u201318 winter ( Fig .\n5.5 ) .\nThe heat responsible for this winter temperature increase is transported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Part III ) .\nIt is paradoxical and contrary to the prevalent view , that Arctic warming was less pronounced during the rapid global warming period of the 1980s and 1990s and is more pronounced during the recent

sea-ice extent that displays a pause since 2007 ( Fig .\n5.6 ) .\nParadoxically , the big increase in yearly averaged Arctic temperature is being publicized as evidence of hefty Arctic amplification ,

seasonally analyzed , it is difficult to understand what is happening , but then it becomes clear that Arctic amplification is not an amplification of global warming .\nArctic winter warming is a strong indication that the climatic effect of solar variability is being profoundly misunderstood , and the contribution from the MSM in solar activity to modern global warming is much larger than accounted for in the IPCC reports and current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hypothesis is that the Arctic winter temperature anomaly will start to decrease when a new more active solar cycle takes place .\nThis

the sun powers the climate system it is logical to assume that a more active sun , by providing more energy , should have a proportional effect on climate , that is opposite to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a less active sun .\nHowever , the study of paleoclimatology shows that this is not the case .\nSolar activity effect on climate is highly asymmetric , with low solar activity having a much more profound effect on climate than high solar activity .\nThe study of solar paleoclimatology was pioneered by Andrew Douglass ( 1919 ) and revived by the landmark study of John Eddy ( 1976 ) on the Maunder minimum .\nSGM throughout the Holocene and their associated climatic effects have been identified by many authors ( Vin\u00f3s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past 1,000 years have received the names of astronomers , while those for the previous 7,000 years received names taken from human history ( see above and in Vin\u00f3s 2022 ) .\nWhat is glaringly lacking is the corresponding identification , naming , and climatic studies of solar grand maxima .\nWhile they can be mathematically defined on the solar activity record ( Usoskin 2017 ) , only the two most recent ones , the medieval solar maximum and the modern solar maximum have been named .\nPaleoclimatic studies do not produce an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears solar grand maxima leave a much smaller footprint on the paleoclimate record than SGM .\nWhat paleoclimatology is telling us is that solar-climate scientists should pay more attention to the effect of low solar activity on climate .\nThe WGK-h helps explain why low solar activity has a stronger effect on climate than high solar activity .\nThe 11-yr solar cycle maximum is a lot more variable than the solar minimum .\nAlthough sunspots are perhaps not the best way to gauge solar activity during solar minima , the sunspot record ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that solar maxima have varied between 81 sunspots in 1816 and 285 in 1958 , a 204-sunspot difference .\nBy contrast solar minima have varied only between 0 sunspots in 1810 , and 18 sunspots at the highest minimum in 1976 , an 18-sunspot difference .\nDuring a solar grand maximum , like the modern one ( 1935-2005 ; see Fig .\n1.6 ) , 6 years of high or very high solar activity are followed by 5 years of low or very low solar activity .\nDuring a SGM all years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very low solar activity .\nWhen solar activity is low the effect of the equatorial stratosphere on the PV ( Holton\u2013Tan effect ) is stronger and the PV becomes anomalously weaker .\nThus , at solar minimum the solar effect is maximum .\nThe biggest positive deviations from trend in winter Arctic temperature usually take place during solar minima ( Fig .\n5.5 ) .\nThe climatic shifts of 1976 and 1997 took place at the solar minimum , which is evidence of the WGK-h .\nThe 1925 shift also took place right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1946 shift after the SC17\u201318 minimum ( see Fig .\n4.8c & f ; Mantua et al .\n1997 ) .\nSolar activity level between minima determines the level of equatorial-polar atmospheric coupling and the Arctic climate over that cycle ( Fig .\n5.4d ) .\nSince regime shifts in atmospheric circulation and climate appear to take place at solar minima , over the following years the activity of the solar maximum determines if a shift takes place .\nIf the activity is similar to the prior cycle there is no shift , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting at the solar minimum is confirmed .\nA predictable result is a high frequency of climate phases that span two solar cycles , like the 1976\u20131997 period .\nThis explains the repeated reports of 22-year solar signals in climate proxies , like the bidecadal drought rhythm in the western US ( Cook et al .\n1997 ) , or tree-ring width in the Arctic ( Ogurtsov et al .\n2020 ) and Southern Chile ( Rigozo et al .\n2007 ) .\nThus , the WGK-h provides an explanation for the asymmetric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypothesis , years of high solar activity result in less energy loss at the winter pole due to a stronger PV and reduced MT ( Fig .\n5.3a ) , while years of low solar activity result in more energy lost from the opposite effect ( Fig .\n5.3b ) .\nDuring high activity solar cycles , 5-6 years of above average solar activity promote lower energy loss at the poles , followed by 4-5 years of below average solar activity that promote higher energy loss at the poles , resulting in moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all or nearly all years display below average solar activity resulting in intensified cooling .\nThe asymmetry in the 11-year cycle variability and in the solar effect on climate by the WGK-h explain why paleoclimatologists only detect the outsized climatic effect of SGM on climate .\nIt is expected from theoretical considerations that long uninterrupted periods of low solar activity should have a bigger climate effect than long periods of intermittent activity .\nPaleoclimatological observations confirm this expectation , supporting that the climatic effect of solar activity is real .\nOne of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role on climate change by the sun is that the 11-year solar cycle does not appear to have a great effect on climate .\nModern climate analysis using satellite data since 1979 have covered almost four full solar cycles , and it is clear that the changes observed , although significant , are modest ( Lean 2017 ; see Fig .\n2.2 ) .\nAnd no change is clear between cycles , much less a trend in any climate variable that would correlate to the trend in solar activity .\nBut solar activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive the name of important solar researchers .\nThe 11-yr Schwabe cycle , the 22-yr Hale cycle , the 100-yr Feynman cycle , the 200-yr de Vries cycle , the 1000-yr Eddy cycle , and the 2500-yr Bray cycle have all been described in the scientific literature as having a climatic effect ( see Vin\u00f3s 2022 , and references within ) .\nThe 100-yr Feynman cycle is responsible for two 11-yr cycles with low activity in the early 1800s ( cycles 5 & 6 , 1798\u20131823 ) , the early 1900s ( cycles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early 2000s ( cycles 24 & 25 , since 2008 and until c. 2030 ) .\nThe 200-yr de Vries cycle is responsible for the spacing of the Wolf , Sp\u00f6rer , and Maunder grand minima during the LIA .\nThe 1000-yr Eddy cycle is responsible for the main climatic periods for the past 2000 years , the Roman Warm Period , the Dark Ages cold period ( also known as the Late Antiquity Little Ice Age ) , the Medieval Warm Period , the LIA , and the Modern warm period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anthropogenic contribution during the past seven decades .\nFrom paleoclimatic studies the longer the solar cycle , the more profound its climatic effect .\nThe biggest effect comes from the 2500-yr Bray cycle , the longest clearly discernible cycle in solar and climatic studies .\nThis cycle , presented in Part II ( Sect .\n2.2 ) , and Fig .\n2.1 , not only established the biological subdivisions of the Holocene ( the Boreal , Atlantic , Sub-Boreal , and Sub-Atlantic periods ) , but also caused great periodic fluctuations in human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et al .\n( 2017 ) say : \u201c We demonstrate multiple instances of human population downturn over the Holocene that coincide with periodic episodes of reduced solar activity and climate reorganization .\n\u2026 This evidence collectively suggests quasi-periodic solar forcing of atmospheric and oceanic circulation with wider climatic consequences.\n\u201d Those periodic episodes of human population downturn correspond in great part to the 2500-yr Bray cycle , as can be appreciated in Fig .\n2.1 or in their figure 3 .\nOne can only imagine the kind of climatic effect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in human population .\nIt appears paradoxical that solar variability has almost no effect on the short term ( the 11-year cycle ) , but a huge effect on the long term ( the 2500-yr cycle ) .\nThe WGK-h also provides an explanation for this cycle-length/climate-effect paradox .\nAs shown in Fig .\n5.3 , solar activity is not the only modulator of MT .\nAt least the QBO , ENSO , the stadium-wave oscillation , and volcanic eruptions act as modulators of MT , and therefore the effect on a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar activity alone could dictate .\nOn top of that during an average activity 11-yr solar cycle close to half of the years act in one direction and close to the other half in the opposite direction .\nThe result is a moderate effect where causality is unclear .\nThe effect of the QBO and ENSO tends toward an average of nearly zero in a few years , and the multidecadal oscillation in a few decades .\nThe longer the solar cycle the longer the period with low solar activity at its troughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest climatic effect is produced by continuous periods of decades when most of the years display low solar activity .\nThe small increment in the large amount of energy that the planet loses at each winter pole during low solar years is cumulative , as with the increased energy retained by the rise in CO .\nProgressively the planet loses more energy that it gains , and cools down .\nThe longer the cycle , the longer the downturn , and the more profound the cooling .\nThe areas in the MT main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( including Europe and North America ) cool first , longer , and more profoundly , but the energy drain affects the entire planet .\nAnd although the Arctic region initially warms due to a larger influx of energy from the enhanced MT , it eventually cools too , as the entire planet gets colder .\nClimate is therefore not very sensitive to solar activity until several consecutive 11-yr cycles of consistently low or high solar activity cause the effect to raise above background noise .\nAnd then only if the multidecadal stadium-wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite direction .\nSolar activity and the stadium-wave cooperated during the 1976\u20131997 climate phase to produce accelerated warming through a strong reduction in MT , that resulted in a long period of global wind stilling ( McVicar & Roderik 2010 ; Zeng et al .\n2019 ) for which no explanation has been provided until now .\nSince 1998 MT has increased , producing Arctic warming and a pause in global warming .\nThe concatenation of two consecutive low solar activity cycles since 2008 and the approaching shift in the stadium-wave towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent cooling of the North Atlantic warming hole ( 46\u00b0N\u201362\u00b0N & 46\u00b0W\u201320\u00b0W ; Latif et al .\n2022 ) , spells trouble for the CO -hypothesis of climate change .\nThe CO hypothesis projects accelerating warming for as long as atmospheric CO keeps rising .\nBut natural climate change is cyclical , and the modern theory of climate change does not understand that .\nIn this part of the series , we have seen how changes in solar activity produce changes in climate by modulating the MT of energy towards the poles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result is that the Modern Solar Maximum has significantly contributed to modern global warming , and the current extended solar minimum is at least partially responsible for the ongoing reduced rate of global warming .\nBut the sun \u2019 s role as a modulator of poleward energy transport can not be deduced from first principles .\nThe stratospheric ozone response to UV changes affects MT via the Charney-Drazin criterion , the Holton-Tan effect , and stratospheric-tropospheric coupling .\nAll these atmospheric phenomena derive from observations , not theory .\nThe IPCC considers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in total incoming energy .\nThe top-down mechanism acts through small UV changes that involve even less energy .\nThe change in UV energy , transferred to stratospheric ozone , is partly converted to changes in wind speed .\nThe energy to

Meridional transport as the main climate change driver", "content": "\u201c No philosopher has been able with his own strength to lift this veil stretched by nature over all the first principles of things .\nMen argue , nature acts.\n\u201d Voltaire ( 1764 ) Climate is a thermodynamic process determined by the energy flux from its entry point , mostly at the top of the atmosphere ( TOA ) of the tropics on the day side of the planet , to its exit point distributed across the TOA of the entire planet .\nThe Earth \u2019 s infrared emission depends on the absolute temperature scale , and on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy a narrow range .\nThe average outgoing longwave radiation ( OLR ) emission of the planet is c. 240 W/m2 and the all-sky average for most of the surface is in a relatively narrow 200\u2013280 W/m2 range ( Dewitte & Clerbaux 2018 ) .\nOLR is determined more by the irregular distribution of atmospheric water ( clouds , humidity ) than by surface temperature .\nThe cloud effect on OLR can reach \u201380 W/m2 ( negative values mean cooling ) in some equatorial areas .\nThus , while 62 % of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of the Earth \u2019 s TOA area ( the 30\u00b0N-S daytime side ) , its exit is much more evenly distributed over the entire TOA area .\nFrom a thermodynamic point of view , the main feature of Earth \u2019 s climate is the transport of energy .\nEnergy transport is the cause of all weather .\nMost of the solar energy that is not reflected is stored in the oceans , where most of the climate system energy resides .\nBut the oceans are not good at transporting energy ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water temperature tend to cause vertical movements through altered buoyancy , not lateral movements , and the oceans are temperature stratified , seriously limiting vertical energy transport .\nMost of the energy in the climate system is transported by the atmosphere , and even a great part of the energy transported by surface ocean currents is wind driven , as ocean circulation is primarily not thermally , but mechanically driven ( Huang 2004 ) .\nThe flux of non-solar energy at the atmospheric-ocean boundary ( including across sea-ice ) is almost always , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atmosphere ( Yu & Weller 2007 ; Schmitt 2018 ) .\nIn a simplified form , the climate can be understood as solar energy being received and stored by the ocean , and then transferred to the atmosphere for transport and ultimately discharged to space .\nThis energy transfer powers the water cycle creating clouds , rain , snow , storms , and all weather phenomena .\nThe system is never in equilibrium , nor can it be expected to be .\nOver the course of a year , the Earth \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cools by c. 3.8 \u00b0C ( see Fig .\n3.1 ) , with a variability from year to year of about 0.1\u20130.2 \u00b0C .\nSo , the Earth is constantly warming or cooling at all timescales .\nThermodynamically , climate change involves changes in energy gain , energy loss , or both .\nA change in the energy partition within the climate system can also be a cause for climate change , and it has been known to happen in the past under special circumstances , like the abrupt release of meltwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago ( Lewis et al .\n2012 ) , or the Dansgaard-Oeschger events , when ocean-stored energy was abruptly released to the atmosphere in the Nordic Seas basin during the last glacial period ( Dokken et al .\n2013 ) .\nThese changes were temporary because climate can only change long-term through a change in the energy budget of the system .\nThe modern theory of climate change understands climate thermodynamics but fails to understand the role of energy redistribution .\nWhen studying climate variables , scientists normally work with what are called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residual of subtracting the \u201c climatology , \u201d or the average changes over 24-hour days and seasons in the variables studied .\nThis point of view magnifies the small interannual variability , but conceals the much larger seasonal changes .\nThe result is that the important seasonal changes in atmospheric and oceanic energy redistribution are usually ignored .\nThe error is compounded because net energy transport within the climate system , if integrated for the entire planet , is zero ( energy lost at one place is gained at other ) .\nRedistribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t matter to most scientists in terms of changing the global climate .\nTo them , the TOA over the dark pole in winter is no different than the daylight tropical TOA , except in the absolute magnitude of the annually averaged energy flux .\nThis narrow view obstructs a proper understanding of climate change .\nChanges in atmospheric greenhouse gases ( GHGs ) alter TOA energy fluxes and constitute one cause of climate change .\nConceptually , climate change is assumed to be due either to an external cause ( forcing ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n6.1 shows a schematic representation of the climate system with many important subsystems and processes .\nAnything that is not affected by Earth \u2019 s climate system is considered external , although the distinction is not absolute .\nFor example , volcanoes are often external to the climate system , however it is known that their frequency responds to changes in sea level and icesheet unloading during deglaciations ( Huybers & Langmuir 2009 ) .\nForcings cause climate change , and feedbacks can cause the amplitude of the changes to increase or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcing effect it is positive , if it dampens the climate change , it is negative .\nIt becomes confusing because the same factor can be both a feedback , if produced naturally in response to climate change , and simultaneously a forcing if produced by humans .\nSeveral GHGs are like that .\nFig .\n6.1 .\nSimplified schematic representation of Earth \u2019 s climate system .\nDifferent subsystems are shown with different background colors .\nClimatic phenomena and processes affecting climate are in white boxes .\nSubsystems and phenomena within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the climate system .\nEverything else is normally not affected by climate ( with some exceptions ) , is considered external .\nSome important properties or phenomena at the interface between subsystems are placed in outside boxes .\nThe Latitudinal ( Equator-to-Pole ) Temperature Gradient is a central property of the climate system that changes continuously and defines the thermal state of the planet ( Scotese 2016 ) .\nFor simplification , lines joining related boxes have been omitted .\nBold names in red are variables affecting the radiative budget and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the IPCC .\nFrom Vin\u00f3s 2022 .\nThe most important GHG due to its abundance is water vapor .\nUnlike CO or methane , water vapor is a condensing GHG and it is not well mixed .\nWater vapor is very unevenly distributed around the planet , and its distribution changes with time .\nThe lowest concentration of water vapor occurs in the polar regions during winter .\nThe radiative properties of different regions of the planet can not be the same if their GHG content is different .\nIt follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region to a lower one increases outgoing radiation efficiency , and therefore , changes in transport must alter the global energy flux budget at the TOA and , as a result , cause climate change .\nAt present that cause is not being considered .\nEvidence suggests it is the main cause for climate change at all timescales from decades to millions of years .\nPlanetary thermodynamics requires that energy transport is mostly from the equatorial region toward both poles in the direction of the meridians , so the flow is termed meridional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the atmosphere gains from the oceans is mainly in the form of latent heat .\nLongwave radiation transfer is roughly half as large , and sensible heat flux is an order of magnitude less ( Schmitt 2018 ) .\nAtmospheric transport of that energy is greatly diminished by the presence of continents and mountain ranges through precipitation and wind speed reduction .\nAs a result , MT takes place mainly over the ocean basins and is , therefore , geographically determined .\nThis has huge implications for weather , climate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes tend to happen spontaneously along gradients , whether they are gradients in mass , energy , or any manifestation of them , like gravity , pressure , or temperature .\nThe gradient that powers MT is the latitudinal temperature gradient ( LTG ) , its primary cause .\nThe LTG is a product of the latitudinal insolation gradient ( LIG , the unequal distribution of incident solar radiation by latitude ) , modulated by the effect of geographic and climate determinants .\nThe LTG is steeper towards the South Pole ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annually symmetrical LIG with respect to the equator .\nAntarctica \u2019 s unique geographic and climatic conditions , and the large area covered by the Southern Hemisphere oceans , make the southern LTG steeper than the northern .\nCionco et al .\n( 2020a ; 2020b ) discuss neglected changes to the LIG at different latitudes during the Holocene , and high frequency variations in LIG due to the 18.63-yr lunal nodal cycle that are likely to affect climate .\nMilankovi\u0107 \u2019 s 1920 proposal that the climate of the Earth is altered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences in the amount of energy received by the planet ( eccentricity ) , but more importantly on differences in the latitudinal and seasonal distribution of the energy ( obliquity and precession ) .\nThese changes in the distribution of the energy alter the LIG , which changes the LTG , which changes the MT of energy .\nIt has long been debated how the obliquity signal that paces interglacials ( Huybers & Wunsch 2005 ) , affects the tropics ( Rossignol-Strick 1985 ; Liu et al .\n2015 ) where the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe answer appears to be that obliquity-induced changes in the LIG ( Bosmans et al .\n2015 ) affect MT .\nSummer LIG is affected by changes to Earth \u2019 s axial tilt caused by the 41 kyr obliquity cycle and by the 18.6 yr lunar cycle .\nThe winter LIG varies with the level of insolation falling on low latitudes , since high latitude insolation , near the winter pole , is minimal ( Davis & Brewer 2011 ) .\nThe changes in the level of insolation at low latitudes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 kyr precession cycle ) , the distance to the sun ( 95 and 125 kyr eccentricity cycles ) and by changes in solar activity ( 11 yr and longer solar cycles ) .\nDavis and Brewer ( 2011 ) have shown that the LTG is very sensitive to changes in the LIG .\nIt is unknown why this hypersensitivity exists .\nThe authors discuss the Kleidon and Lorenz ( 2005 ) proposal that MT adjusts itself to produce maximum entropy ( Fig .\n6.2 ) .\nFig .\n6.2 .\nProposition that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entropy .\nThe latitudinal temperature gradient , resulting from the difference between tropical ( continuous line ) and polar ( dashed line ) temperatures is represented by the gray area .\nEntropy production ( dotted line ) is minimal when there is no transport of energy ( left side of abscissa ) , or when transport is so efficient that there is no temperature difference ( right side of abscissa ) , and maximal at some point in between .\nAfter Kleidon and Lorenz ( 2005 ) .\nKleidon and Lorenz ( 2005 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entropy production has been confirmed by simulations with general circulation models .\nThey are obviously wrong , as computer models only constitute scientific evidence of human programming skills .\nThat MT adjusts automatically to maximum entropy production requires a very large number of degrees of freedom ( possible outcomes ) , and as reviewed in part V ( Sec .\n5.2 ) MT is modulated by multiple factors that are not well represented in computer models , which reduces the degrees of freedom .\nIt is very likely that the adjustment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part by entropy , but the Winter Gatekeeper hypothesis ( WGK-h ; see part V ) explains how the LIG can affect the LTG by directly acting on MT .\nIt is important to keep in mind that if the LTG can change MT , the opposite must also happen , so the causality of the changes might be difficult to determine .\nThe WGK-h provides an explanation for the hypersensitivity of the LTG to changes in the LIG due to changes in solar activity , but not by other causes such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that the LIG responds to the lunar 18-yr cycle and the solar 11-yr cycle ( Davis & Brewer 2011 ) , it is interesting to see that the stadium-wave multidecadal oscillation in MT could be pulsating at the rhythm marked by the interference between the lunar 9-yr half-cycle and the solar 11-yr cycle ( Vin\u00f3s 2022 ; see Fig .\n4.8f ) .\nIf real , changes in the LIG resulting from this interference provide a mechanism by which the stadium-wave period and strength are determined , i.e.\n, the changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ultimately shape the stadium-wave .\nWhile the LIG determines the distribution of the energy input to the climate system at the TOA , 29 % of that energy is returned to space by atmospheric and surface albedo .\nReflected solar energy is highest during Jan-Mar due to SH cloud albedo , while OLR is highest Jun-Aug due to higher emission during NH summer ( Fig .\n6.3 ) .\nThe result of these differences is that the planet is colder during the boreal winter , when it is closest to the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Sect .\n3.1 & Fig .\n3.1 ) .\nThere are very important differences between the hemispheres regarding climate energy and transport .\nAs figure 6.3a shows , outside the tropics OLR essentially follows temperature .\nWithin the tropics OLR and temperature show inverse correlation , as higher temperature leads to increased cloud cover and less emission .\nAccording to the modern theory of climate change the increase in GHGs results in the same IR emission to space taking place from a higher , colder altitude , requiring surface warming to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emit the same energy it receives , not more , unless it is cooling .\nUnder this model inter-annual OLR from the TOA should not change unless there is a change in incoming solar energy or in albedo .\nAlbedo has been very constant since we have been able to measure it with sufficient precision , with an inter-annual variability of 0.2 Wm\u20132 ( 0.2 % ; Stephens et al .\n2015 ) , and solar energy , termed the solar constant , varies by only 0.1 % ( Lean 2017 ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ times higher than GHG radiative forcing changes .\nWhat is worse , the inter-annual changes in OLR are neither global , nor follow temperature changes ( Fig .\n6.3b ) .\nWhile extratropical SH OLR shows no trend over the last four decades , and tropical OLR shows a small and insignificant trend , the extratropical NH OLR displays a very strong increase .\nIs this increase due to the higher warming experienced by the NH ?\nAccording to the data it is not , because during the 1980s and 90s when accelerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly , while between 1997-2007 , when the Pause was taking place , extratropical NH OLR underwent most of the increase of the past four decades ( Fig .\n6.3b grey area ) .\nIt logically follows that the negative anomaly in extratropical NH OLR before 2000 contributed to the warming , while the positive anomaly afterwards contributed to the Pause .\nObviously , the increase in GHGs can not explain any of this , but the changes in MT that took place at the 1997-98 climate shift have no problem explaining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NH ( see Part IV ) .\nFig .\n6.3 .\nOutgoing longwave

their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1997\u20132006 period that displayed accelerated Arctic climate change ( see Sect .\n4.5 ) .\nData from KNMI explorer NOAA OLR .\nOne of the most puzzling aspects of climate is that , despite very different land , ocean , and snow/ice surface extensions , both hemispheres have essentially the same albedo .\nThis phenomenon is known as hemispheric albedo symmetry ( Datseris & Stevens 2021 ) .\nModels fail to reproduce such a crucial aspect of the climate , because nobody knows how it is produced and maintained ( Stephens et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stevens ( 2021 ) have identified cloud asymmetries over extratropical storm tracks as the compensating factor of the surface albedo asymmetries .\nStorm tracks are MT highways over already MT-favored oceanic basins .\nStorms are the product of baroclinic instability along the LTG and transport a great amount of energy as latent heat .\nThey are also responsible for a significant part of global cloudiness , linking MT to cloud cover .\nChanges in MT must necessarily result in changes in cloudiness , altering the climate .\nIf the albedo of the Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track cloudiness , albedo is probably another fundamental climate property linked to the strength of MT .\nThe climate system is composed of the oceans , land surface , biosphere , cryosphere , and atmosphere ( Fig .\n6.1 ) .\nThese different components exchange mass and energy , but for the climate system as a whole , energy gains and loses take place at the TOA .\nParts of the TOA where the energy gain/loss ratio is positive , mainly above the tropics , constitute an energy source for the climate system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts as an energy sink .\nThe biggest energy sink is the TOA above the winter pole .\nOn average , energy enters the system at the source and is passed from climate component to climate component as it is transported towards the sink .\nThe flux of energy through the climate system is characterized by both temporal and spatial variability .\nAs a result , the amount of energy in transit through any element of the transport system changes over time , altering the enthalpy ( total \u201c heat \u201d content ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change in temperature .\nWe infer the regulation of MT by certain control centers that constitute energy gateways into and out of the climate system .\nThese MT control centers are the polar vortex ( PV ) , ENSO system , and the ozone layer .\nTheir conditions change in response to changes in the main modulators of MT , resulting in changes in global energy transport .\nThe absorption of solar energy in the tropics is spectrally differentiated .\nThe 200\u2013315 nm part of the spectrum is absorbed in the stratospheric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part is mainly absorbed in the photic layer of the tropical oceans .\nThe energy absorbed by the ocean is transported poleward in three different ways ( Fig .\n6.4 ) .\nPart of it reaches the stratosphere through convection and constitutes the ascending branch of the Brewer-Dobson circulation , another part is transported in the troposphere by the Hadley circulation , and the last part is transported by the ocean .\nThe ENSO state dictates the relative distribution of the energy to be transported .\nLa Ni\u00f1a favors oceanic transport , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain times the amount of energy to be transported exceeds capacity and an El Ni\u00f1o is triggered .\nEl Ni\u00f1o directs a great amount of energy towards the stratosphere and troposphere , extracting it from the ocean and warming the surface of the planet in the process .\nDuring the Holocene Climatic Optimum ( 9\u20135.5 ka ) the planet was warmer , MT was reduced as a consequence , and it resulted in a very reduced frequency of Los Ni\u00f1os ( Moy et al .\n2002 )

which explains the increase in Los Ni\u00f1os from 1000\u20131400 AD as the world descended into the Little Ice Age ( LIA ; Moy et al .\n2002 ) .\nOver the past two centuries El Ni\u00f1o frequency

climate fluctuation ( Timmermann et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the entry point of most of the energy into the climate system makes it a control center for MT that is modulated by solar activity ( see Fig .\n2.4 ) .\nIt is well known that ENSO responds to stratospheric conditions ( e.g.\n, volcanic eruptions ) and subsurface conditions ( warm water volume ) , thus linking MT at different levels .\nPaleoclimatology shows it responds to planetary thermodynamics , i.e.\n, it is related to how the planet warms and cools .\nAs Moy et al .\n( 2002 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bond events tend to occur during periods of low ENSO activity immediately following a period of high ENSO activity , which suggests that some link may exist between the two systems.\n\u201d Bond events are century-long cold periods , like the LIA , that are brought about in part by strongly increasing ENSO activity ( frequent , strong Ni\u00f1os ) .\nAfter the planet stops cooling ENSO activity decreases .\nThe 200\u2013315 nm

total ( Lean 2017 ) , it varies with solar activity ten times more than the > 320 nm range and is responsible for the radiative and dynamic changes that take place in the stratosphere during the solar cycle .\nUV energy absorption in the stratosphere is on average 3.85 W/m2 ( Eddy et al .\n2003 ; one fourth of 15.4 W/m2 ) .\nThis is not a small amount .\nIt constitutes 5 % of the solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et al .\n2019 ) .\nThe ozone control center handles a significant part of the energy received by the climate , despite being just the UV energy portion .\nThe stratosphere is c. 5 times larger than the troposphere and contains c. 5 times less mass .\nWith a density over an order of magnitude lower , the effect of the absorbed solar energy on stratospheric temperature is huge .\nWithout ozone the stratosphere would be 50 K colder and the tropopause would not exist ( Reck 1976 ) .\nThe ozone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a result of atmospheric oxygenation , that probably developed during the Ediacaran or Cambrian , some 600\u2013480 Ma .\nOzone absorption of solar energy in the stratosphere allows the formation of a stratospheric LTG that depends on UV energy , ozone amount , and ozone distribution .\nThe gradient forms through shortwave heating of ozone and radiative longwave transfer involving mainly CO and ozone .\nAlong this gradient the zonal wind circulation is established by the balance between the pressure gradient and the Coriolis factor ( geostrophic balance ) .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both hemispheres , with the winter hemispheric circulation characterized by westerly winds and the formation of a polar vortex ( see Fig .\n3.7 ) .\nPlanetary waves generated at the troposphere can only propagate upwards when stratospheric winds are westerly and of a certain velocity range ( Charney-Drazin criterion ) .\nThese conditions are present in winter , and as a result winter stratospheric circulation is more perturbed ( Haynes 2005 ) , resulting in higher MT .\nPlanetary waves

deflected downward towards the troposphere affecting circulation there .\nTheir effect in the stratosphere is to drive meridional circulation , reduce westerly circulation , and weaken the polar

the zonal circulation easterly , causing sudden stratospheric warming as air is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vortex splits or is displaced away from the pole .\nThis happens about every other year in the NH , but rarely in the SH , and has great repercussions for tropospheric weather .\nChanges that take place in the winter stratosphere affect weather on the surface on a longer timescale due to stratospheric-tropospheric downward coupling .\nUnambiguous observations of stratospheric variability affecting the surface show up in the Arctic Oscillation ( Northern Annular Mode ) , North Atlantic sea-level pressures , extreme weather events , the frequency of winter cold spells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jet , and low frequency variations in the Atlantic thermohaline circulation ( Baldwin et al .\n2019 ) .\nStratospheric variability partly controls the tropospheric heat flux into the Arctic ( Baldwin et al .\n2019 ) , showing that ozone response to solar radiation in the stratosphere acts as a major control center for MT .\nStratospheric circulation and variability are the result of ozone and its response to solar energy .\nFurthermore , the stratosphere , itself , is the result of ozone .\nSolar UV energy has two separate roles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygen and ozone it regulates the amount of ozone , and through radiative heating it regulates the stratospheric LTG which sets up stratospheric circulation and its response to planetary wave flux .\nThe effect of wave flux on the Brewer Dobson circulation ( i.e.\n, stratospheric MT ) has been termed the \u201c extratropical pump \u201d ( Haynes 2005 ) .\nAs a result , the ozone control center participates in the modulation of MT of energy and is sensitive to changes in solar activity through photolysis and shortwave radiative heating rates ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The body of evidence on the impact of solar variability on tropospheric climate through changes in the state of the stratosphere has significantly grown in the last few decades ( Haigh 2010 ) .\nTogether with sea-ice , the PV constitutes a negative feedback to planetary cooling .\nIt forms due to strong cooling in the polar autumn because of very low insolation and sea-ice formation .\nAtmospheric cooling increases air density , and as the cold air sinks it creates a low-pressure center with cyclonic ( counterclockwise in the NH ) circulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winds become stronger , they isolate the interior of the vortex where radiative cooling continues .\nThe strong winter temperature contrast drives the zonal wind circulation that stabilizes the vortex until the sun returns .\nWithout a PV ( and sea-ice ) the planet would lose a lot more energy every winter .\nIt is thus trivially evident that a strong PV favors planetary warming , and a weak PV favors planetary cooling .\nThe PV is a product of winter zonal circulation .\nSince , MT is driven by meridional circulation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulation , the PV constitutes one of the main MT control centers .\nIt regulates energy access to the biggest energy sink in the planet , the winter polar TOA ( see Fig .\n3.2 ) .\nThe discovery of the PV response to the equatorial Quasi-Biennial Oscillation ( QBO ; Holton & Tan 1980 ) shows that the PV is not solely the result of high latitude atmospheric conditions .\nIt was later found that PV conditions also responded to the solar cycle ( Labitzke 1987 ) , even though the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in winter .\nAfter the Pinatubo eruption it became clear that the PV was also affected by stratosphere-reaching volcanic eruptions ( Stenchikov et al .\n2002 ; Azoulay et al .\n2021 ) , resulting in volcanic winter warming at mid-high latitudes instead of the expected cooling due to solar energy reduction from stratospheric aerosols .\nIt is clear now that the PV responds to changes in the stratospheric LTG and to changes in the propagation of planetary waves in the stratosphere .\nPlanetary waves deposit energy and momentum close to the vortex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong potential vorticity gradient of the vortex .\nVortex dynamics cause wave perturbations to travel downwards making the vortex more susceptible to successive lower altitude waves and propagating the effect to the troposphere ( Scott & Dritschel 2005 ) .\nThis provides an explanation for the stratosphere-troposphere downward coupling at high latitudes .\nThus , PV strength is the result of equatorial-polar gradients in temperature , zonal wind speed and potential vorticity that determine planetary wave effect on the zonal flow ( Monier & Weare 2011 ) .\nPV strength also depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n2020 ) .\nAs we have seen ( Sects .\n4.7 & 5.4 ; Christiansen 2010 ) , PV strength experiences inter-annual and multidecadal oscillations that affect the Arctic Oscillation and surface weather events , like the frequency of severe winter cold air outbreaks ( Huang et al .\n2021 ) .\nMultidecadal changes in PV strength have confused atmospheric scientists for a long time ( Wallace 2000 ) .\nMultidecadal periods when the polar vortex is stronger than average result in the Arctic , Atlantic , and Pacific sectors behaving as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Fig .\n6.5a & c ) , with a seesaw relationship between the Aleutian and Icelandic Lows ( Shi & Nakamura 2014 ) , restricting heat and moisture transport into the Arctic .\nIn contrast , multidecadal periods when the polar vortex is weaker than average result in a situation best described by the North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ; Fig .\n6.5b ) , with weak Aleutian Low interannual variability and less restricted Arctic transport .\nThe scientific literature discussions about whether the NAO or the NAM paradigms better describe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Wallace 2000 ) , appear to ignore that its changing nature is linked to climate regime shifts ( see Part IV ) that characterize climate change .\nFig .\n6.5 .\nThe shifting nature of the Northern Annular Mode/North Atlantic Oscillation .\nThe

the coordination of the three centers of action , otherwise it can be better described as a North Atlantic Oscillation .\nAfter Shi and Nakamura 2014 .\nThe PV regulates the exchange of air masses , moisture , and energy between the mid-latitudes and the polar latitudes .\nIt responds to tropospheric climate shifts and to stratospheric conditions , and is affected by the propagation and reflection/absorption of planetary waves .\nIt is modulated by solar activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volcanic eruptions , constituting a control center for MT .\nNearly all the energy and all the moisture transported poleward takes place in the troposphere and upper ocean .\nAs the intensity of this transport varies geographically over time it gives rise to what has been termed modes of climate variability .\nThese modes of variability have fluctuated in the 20th century with a c. 65-yr multidecadal oscillation that produced the observed shifts in climate regimes .\nThis oscillation , termed here the stadium-wave ( Wyatt & Curry 2014 ) , was detected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and has been observed in North Atlantic sea level pressure and winds ( Kushnir 1994 ) , North Pacific and North American temperature ( Minobe 1997 ) , length of day and core angular momentum ( Hide et al .\n2000 ) , fish populations ( Mantua et al .\n1997 ; Klyashtorin 2001 ) , Arctic temperature and sea ice extent ( Polyakov et al .\n2004 ) , the relative frequency of ENSO events ( Verdon & Franks 2006 ) , and global mean sea level ( Jevrejeva et al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global MT system variability .\nThe oscillation mostly affects the two ocean basins that communicate directly with both poles , particularly from the equator ( ENSO ) to the NH high latitudes , and it affects the rotation of the Earth through changes in the angular momentum of the atmosphere ( Hide et al .\n2000 ; Klyashtorin & Lyubushin 2007 ) , showing the coupled response of the ocean and the atmosphere .\nThe multidecadal oscillations in SST ( Atlantic multidecadal and Pacific decadal oscillations , AMO and PDO ) are simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MT through these elements .\nSince the amount of energy entering the climate system on an annual basis is nearly constant , the warm phase in the AMO or PDO reflects a slowdown in MT causing an energy \u201c jam.\n\u201d More energy resides at that time in those elements , perhaps due to a reduced ocean-atmosphere flux caused by a predominantly zonal wind pattern in the mid-latitudes .\nThe spatial pattern of the AMO , obtained by regression of North Atlantic SST anomalies after subtracting the global SST anomalies , reveals that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a global MT system that moves heat poleward .\nThe global system also includes the Pacific and Indian basins ( Fig .\n6.6 ) .\nIt shows that the NH SST oscillation of the AMO is phase-locked with other global SST oscillations , reflecting coordinated changes in the global MT system .\nFig .\n6.6 .\nAtlantic multidecadal oscillation spatial pattern .\nUnitless ( \u00b0C/\u00b0C ) regression pattern of monthly SST anomalies ( HadISST 1870\u20132008 ) , after subtracting the global mean anomaly from the North Atlantic SST anomaly .\nIt displays the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMO index .\nBesides displaying the AMO pattern , it shows that AMO is linked to the global surface MT system that extracts heat from the tropics in the main ocean basins .\nAfter Deser et al .\n2010 .\nThis global MT system is the complex result of the geographically determined coupled atmosphere-ocean circulation in a rotating planet with its axis tilted in relation to the ecliptic , that receives most of its energy in the tropics .\nSince the transport intensity varies through time and space , authors typically focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about teleconnections and atmospheric bridges to try and explain what are , in essence , elements of a single very complex process ( Fig .\n6.7 ) .\nThe importance of MT for the planet \u2019 s climate can not be overstated and multidecadal changes in MT are an important and overlooked factor in climate change .\nIt is a common assumption that the sum of multidecadal variability effects over time trends to zero .\nStudies on the change in the AMO amplitude over the past six centuries ( Moore et al .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFig .\n6.7 .\nMeridional transport is the overlooked climate factor .\nMeridional transport is both the elephant in the room that everybody ignores as an explanation for climate change , and the elephant from the Indian tale that blind people describe as a different animal when touching different parts of it .\nThe stadium-wave has a period long enough to have made an important contribution to Modern Global Warming .\nAccording to Chylek et al .\n( 2014 ) one third of the post-1975 global warming is due to the positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overestimate GHG warming but compensate for it by overestimating aerosol cooling .\nRegardless of the evidence , the IPCC does not consider that internal variability has contributed significantly to climate change between 1951\u2013 2010 ( see Fig .\n5.1 ) .\nAn alternative view is that a combination of solar activity and a 65-yr oscillation , if allowed an unconstrained contribution , can explain a great part of the increase in the global warming rate over the 20th century , with residual changes attributable to the CO increase and volcanic activity .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate of climate sensitivity , to the different known forcings , is erroneous , a possibility supported by dynamical systems identification ( de Larminat 2016 ) .\nAs shown in the Fig .\n5.2 flow diagram , solar activity affects stratospheric transport directly , and tropospheric transport indirectly .\nThe stadium-wave governs tropospheric transport as an emergent resonant phenomenon .\nWhen both act in the same direction the effect is maximal , as happened during the 1976\u20131997 period when both worked to reduce MT and warm the globe .\nDuring the 1890\u20131924 period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused global cooling .\nBut at times they are out of step and in these periods the stadium-wave has a bigger effect because tropospheric transport is much stronger .\nDuring the 1924\u20131935 period , solar activity was low , but the stadium-wave was on the warming portion of its cycle , resulting in the early 20th century warming .\nDuring the 1945\u20131976 period , solar activity was high , but the stadium-wave was set on cooling , and cooling resulted due to high MT .\nIn those periods where solar activity and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stadium-wave effect predominates because it is larger , but the effect isn \u2019 t as strong as when they cooperate in increasing or decreasing MT .\nMT is the real \u201c control knob \u201d of climate change .\nDuring the 20th century , the stadium wave 65-year oscillation had two warming periods , for a total of about 65 years in the warm mode .\nSolar activity displayed the c. 70-year long Modern Solar Maximum ( 1935\u20132005 ) .\nThis means that both natural forcing and internal variability spent most of the century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual coincidence of such long periods of natural contribution helps explain why the early 20th century warmed in the absence of significant GHG emissions , and why so much warming was observed that century as to raise the alarms .\nThe natural contribution to the observed warming comes at the expense of reducing the anthropogenic contribution .\nThe search for the solar effect on climate leads us to an unexpected conclusion about how the climate changes .\nFor solar variations to influence climate change , it is necessary that the climate control knob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooling radiators of the Earth are fed energy through MT .\nAs a result , MT is responsible for most climate change at all timescales .\nThe drivers of MT change depending upon the time frame being considered .\n\u2022 At the inter-annual scale , the noise is high , but change is governed by ENSO and short-term phenomena like volcanic eruptions through their effect on PV strength and MT .\n\u2022 At the multidecadal scale climate change is governed by the stadium-wave and all its parts , causing climate regime shifts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale is the solar realm .\nThe sun reigns in climate change through its secular cycles in solar activity , acting through long-term changes in MT , particularly during SGM , but also during extended maxima like the MSM .\n\u2022 In the multi-millennial scale Milankovitch rules .\nThe orbitally induced changes in the LIG cause changes in MT .\nAs obliquity decreases , it increases insolation in the tropics and decreases it at the poles .\nThis steepens the LIG during the summers , increasing MT , which drives the required heightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moisture will remain locked there , as ice and snow , until the process reverses .\nThis is how the necessary moisture reaches the high latitudes during glaciations ( Masson-Delmotte et al .\n2005 ) .\nLater , when obliquity increases , MT becomes more restricted , contributing to the mid-latitudes warming during deglaciations .\nObliquity \u2019 s strong climatic signature in the tropics has been linked to meridional transport ( Bosmans et al .\n2015 ) .\n\u2022 At the largest time scale , it is plate tectonics that governs climate change @ @ @

are caused by the position of continents , ocean gateways , and mountain ranges , that increase poleward ( meridional ) heat transport .\nMulti-million-year Earth warming results when the opposite happens .\nIt is generally accepted that MT keeps the poles warmer than they should be otherwise .\nWithout MT the poles would be 100 \u00b0C colder than the equator on average , instead of 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part III ( Sec .\n3.2 ) we reviewed the \u201c low gradient paradox , \u201d and said a possible solution would be offered in this part .\nThis paradox arises from the climate of the early Eocene , the Cretaceous , and early Paleogene , characterized by a warm world with a reduced LTG and low seasonality ( Huber & Caballero 2011 ) .\nSuch equable climates can not be explained by modern climate theory without resorting to extreme CO levels and implaussibly high tropical temperatures .\nAt the root of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradient paradox ( Huber & Caballero 2011 ) .\nFor the poles to be warm all year around more energy from the tropics was required , yet since the poles were warm all year around then , the LTG was very flat resulting in less energy transport .\nThe paradox is only apparent because , as we have seen in parts III to V , the more energy directed toward the poles the colder the planet gets , so it was actually the low gradient that kept the planet and the poles warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been in the Late Cenozoic Ice Age for the past 34 Ma because it is hemorrhaging heat at the winter pole from two gigantic cooling radiators .\nIn the early Eocene , heat loss at the winter pole was limited by an intense cloud- , fog- , and water vapor-GHE during the polar night .\nWarm polar conditions were not the result of more heat transported from the tropical band .\nThe transition from the early Eocene equable climate to the Pleistocene icehouse climate can be explained by changes in MT and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poles .\nAt the early Eocene ( 52 Ma ) the world geography was very favorable to zonal circulation .\nThere was a well-developed circumglobal seaway formed by the Tethys Sea , the Panama Gateway , and the Indonesian Passage ( Fig .\n6.8a ) .\nConnections to the Arctic were through shallow water seaways and across continents which severely restricted MT towards a warm Arctic above freezing all year around .\nMT towards Antarctica was unimpeded , but it was free of ice and covered by vegetation , with a stronger GHE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , due to global warm conditions .\nThe Arctic Gateway ( between the North Atlantic and the Arctic oceans ) began opening about 55 Ma allowing increased MT toward the North Pole ( Fig .\n6.8c ; Lyle et al .\n2008 ) .\nThis opening has been proposed as the cause of the long Eocene cooling ( Vahlenkamp et al .\n2018 ) .\nAs the planet cooled the LTG deepened , driving more energy towards both poles , and acting as a positive feedback to global cooling .\nThe Tasman Gateway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At 34 Ma several low amplitude obliquity oscillations coincided in a very unusual configuration ( Fig .\n6.8d , box ) promoting cool summers for 200 kyr .\nAntarctica had already developed several ice sheets at higher elevations .\nA tipping point was reached when low eccentricity promoted ice growth at a time when low obliquity amplitude facilitated summer ice survival , triggering Antarctic glaciation in just 80 kyr ( Coxall et al .\n2005 ) .\nThe glaciation was completed 400 kyr later during another period of low eccentricity ( Fig .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an extensive ice sheet for most of the Oligocene , but after the Mid-Oligocene Glacial Interval c. 26 Ma , and until the end of the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum at c. 14 Ma ( a 12 Myr interval ) the planet entered a warm period that apparently nobody can explain .\nAt the time CO levels collapsed , according to proxies ( Beerling and Royer 2011 ) , from 450 to 200 ppm ( Fig .\n6.8c , blue triangle ) , and remained very low for the entire period except during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basalt flows ( peak CO : 16\u201315 Ma ) .\nSo , during the Late Oligocene to the Mid-Miocene warm period , CO changes do not explain temperature changes .\nRecent research suggests most of this period was characterized by a strongly reduced LTG ( Guiti\u00e1n et al .\n2019 ) , indicative of reduced MT .\nThe Drake passage opened around the beginning of that warm period

scientists has been the topic of numerous prior blog posts at Climate Etc .\nSuch activism is generally focused on eliminating fossil fuels .\nThis post presents a new framing for the activism issue .\nWhile many scientists prefer to remain in the ivory tower , others desire to engage in the messiness of politics and policy making .\nWhy most scientists reject admonitions to \u201c stay in their

.\nThe authors are faculty members in the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is behind paywall , but a Guardian article interviews the authors .\nIt is clear that this is not just a scholarly article on civil disobedience .\nThe quote that really popped out for me was by Berglund : Since when do psychologists have epistemic authority to speak on climate change , its impacts and relevant policies ?\nInside Climate News has another choice quote from the actual paper : Ya think ?\nIs this all it takes ?\nAlso cited in this article is a statement from Peter Kalmus : Peter Kalmus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Jet Propulsion Lab , agrees .\nIn April , Kalmus was arrested for locking himself to the front door of a JPMorgan Chase bank branch and has since urged other scientists to join him in protest , saying it \u2019 s their duty as experts to convey the weight of their findings to the public and convince elected officials to take proper recourse .\nExactly how does civil disobedience get meaningful information out there ?\nThese scientists seem to be taking their cues from Michael Mann \u2019 s book for children entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of these climate scientists actually read the IPCC AR6 ?\nSo why haven \u2019 t more climate scientists joined this call to action ?\nMaybe because they find this kind of behavior embarrassing and counterproductive .\nJim Hansen

should join those who do know .\nFinally and most importantly , I would urge you to consider that maybe we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with communities .\n\u201c Pangost \u2019 s essay reflects scientists attempting to work constructively with policy makers , planners and stakeholders , primarily on the issue of mitigation ( reduction of CO2 emissions ) and associated societal changes .\nThere are clearly frustrations , but this approach is far more effective than simpleton tantrums .\nAnd finally we come to wicked scientists .\nAs I have written in multiple previous posts , a wicked problem is characterized by multiple problem definitions , contentious methods of understanding , chronic conditions of ignorance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both the problem and the proposed solutions .\nThe complex web of causality may result in surprising unintended consequences of attempted solutions that generate new vulnerabilities or exacerbate the original harm .\nFurther , wickedness makes it difficult to identify points of irrefutable failure or success in either the science or the policies .\nWicked problems are both complex and political .\nAlthough much has been written about wicked problems and the need to address them , there is not much in the way of guidance for effectively tackling wicked problems .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u201c Wicked science \u201d is a process that is tailored to the dual scientific and political natures of wicked societal problems .\nAs such , wicked science is massively transdisciplinary , including natural sciences and engineering along with social sciences and humanities .\nWicked science uses approaches from complexity science and systems thinking in a context that engages with the political roles and perspectives of decision makers , planners and other stakeholders .\nWicked problems and the strategies devised to address them can not be de\ufb01ned by scienti\ufb01c experts alone , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a range of stakeholders .\nTwo recent papers by atmospheric/climate scientists have articulated something similar to wicked science for the climate sciences , that notably focus more on adaptation than mitigation .\nAdam Sobel \u2019 s paper \u201c Usable climate science is adaptation science \u201d emphasizes that the localness of adaptation implies much greater uncertainty in the relevant climate science .\nClimate science for adaptation is more about characterizing uncertainty for robust decision making .\nUsable climate science requires that scientists engage in co-production of usable science with stakeholders , with a willingness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors are manifest in a particular setting .\nRegina Rodrigues and Ted Shepherd \u2019 s paper entitled \u201c Small is beautiful : climate-change science as if people mattered \u201d addresses strategies for grappling with the complexity of local situations .\nThe strategies include expressing climate knowledge in conditional form in terms of scenarios developed via the storyline approach , and working with local communities to make sense of their own situations .\nCombining and integrating knowledge from diverse disciplines and other sources to provide insights , explanations and solutions to wicked problems is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orientation of wicked science to be meaningful , we need an overarching philosophy for navigating wicked problems .\nWe need to acknowledge that control is limited , the future is unknown , and it is difficult to determine whether the impact you make will be positive .\nWe need to accept that climate change will continue to disrupt natural systems and human wellbeing ; this acknowledgement helps avoid the urgency trap .\nBy acknowledging that there is no road back , we can focus on the road ahead .\nWicked scientists are willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorny social problems .\nAs such , wicked scientists are not activists that are advocating for a preferred political/policy solution and recognize the reality of political disagreement as a key aspect for dealing with wicked problems .\nWicked scientists are needed to break the hegemony of disciplinary researchers , particularly those who are strident political activists , as being regarded as experts for solutions to the wicked problem of climate change .\nWhile the IPCC has operated via a loose cooperation between multiple disciplines , genuine transdisciplinary understanding and collaborations , across disciplines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is needed for meaningful contributions to wicked problems .\nSome universities are starting to grapple with how to train wicked scientists .\nWorking in the private weather/climate services sector provides a crash course in being a wicked scientist , in terms of becoming conversant with additional disciplines , working in transdisciplinary teams , an emphasis on uncertainty , and actually listening to and working with policy makers , planners and stakeholders .\nNot only is activism not needed for problem solving , but it mostly seems counterproductive to actually formulating and evaluating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilitated by broader , transdisciplinary thinking about the climate change problem and its solutions .\nThis requires moving away from the consensus-enforcing and cancel culture approach of attempting to restrict the dialogue surrounding climate change and the policy options .\nWe need to open up space for dissent , disagreement and discussion about scientific uncertainty and policy options , so that multiple perspectives can be considered and broader support can be built for a range of policy options .\nBring on the wicked scientists .\nBut if a scientist is dominated by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue to take the court jester path and not contribute to solutions in a meaningful way .",

idea that a system might be unprepared because it had a peak that was a few percentage values higher than what was seen 5 years ago would have seemed strange to a planner 30 years ago .\nMany of us were used to seeing spurts in peak demand growth that averaged 8 to 10 % a year or more .\nThe peak demand shown above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most basic planning criteria is that a system should be able to

adjustments , we would not see the problems we are seeing .\nWhy is California challenged now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges in the future ?\nPrimarily because the focus on green energy is increasing the percentage of \u201c green \u201d intermittent resources .\n\u201c Green \u201d resources are not as dependable as traditional rotating machinery nor do they support the system as well .\nIt is likely that these resources have been credited with more ability to provide capacity than is warranted , and when the rubber meets the road they don \u2019 t perform as \u201c expected \u201d .\nIntermittent resources cause problems on both the generation side and the load side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serves to reduce load as seen by the Cal ISO .\nWhen solar is not performing well available load which is not

resources planning would be enhanced .\nHowever , being honest about the capabilities of \u201c green \u201d resources would have consequences that some would find unacceptable .\nThere has been a big

addition to crediting \u201c green \u201d resources above their dependable capability , others subsidies include directing costs associated with such additions to others .\nBeing honest makes the

.\nAs the scientific evidence for the hypothesis was presented in the first six parts of the series , this summary will present only the conclusions , some additional supporting evidence , and answer a few interesting questions and comments from readers .\nThe IPCC assessment reports published since 1990 , reflect a scientific consensus that natural forces , including solar activity and ocean-atmosphere oscillations , like the Atlantic and Pacific multidecadal oscillations , had a net zero effect on the observed global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The IPCC consensus does not allow for changes in the poleward ( meridional ) transport of energy to have significantly affected this average temperature over the past 75 years .\nThe Winter Gatekeeper hypothesis proposes that changes in the meridional transport of energy and moisture are the main way the climate changes now and in the past .\nMeridional transport variability has many causes and forces that act simultaneously and in different time frames on the climate system .\nThey integrate into a very complex poleward energy transportation system .\nAmong these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ozone , stratospheric-reaching tropical volcanic eruptions , orbital changes , and changing luni-solar gravitational pull .\nMeridional transport is therefore an integrator of internal and external signals .\nIt is not the only way the climate changes , but evidence suggests it is the main one .\nThe Winter Gatekeeper hypothesis does not disprove greenhouse gas effect induced climate change\u2014manmade or otherwise\u2014in fact , it acts through it .\nBut it does not require changes in the atmospheric content of non-condensing greenhouse gases to cause significant climate change .\nTherefore , it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main climate change control knob .\nMeridional transport moves energy that is already in the climate system toward its exit point at the top of the atmosphere at a higher latitude .\nIt is carried out mainly by the atmosphere , in both the stratosphere and troposphere , with an important oceanic contribution .\nThe greenhouse effect is not homogeneous over the planet due to the unequal distribution of water vapor , and it is stronger in the wet tropics , weaker over deserts , and much weaker at the poles in winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more energy reaches the poles .\nThere it can more efficiently exit the climate system , particularly during the winter , when there is no Sun in the sky .\nMost polar imported moisture in winter freezes , emitting its latent heat .\nAdditional CO molecules increase outward radiation , as they are warmer than the surface .\nThe net result is that all imported energy into the polar regions in winter exits the climate system at the top of the atmosphere ( Peixoto & Oort , 1992 , p. 363 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time can only increase the loss .\nWhen meridional transport is stronger , the planet loses more energy and cools down ( or warms less ) in a non-homogeneous way , because the net energy loss is greater in the polar regions .\nHowever , as more energy is directed toward the poles , the Arctic region warms , even as the rest of the world cools or warms more slowly .\nWhen meridional transport is weaker , less energy reaches the poles and exits the climate system .\nThen the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arctic cools , because it receives less energy from the lower latitudes .\nMost of the energy is transported through the lower troposphere and ocean track .\nAs a result , changes in multidecadal ocean oscillations produce a greater effect on climate in the multidecadal timeframe than changes in solar activity .\nSolar changes have a stronger effect on stratospheric energy transport .\nEven so , there is a non-well defined link between changes in solar activity and changes in the multidecadal oscillations that result in major multidecadal climate shifts right after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IV ) .\nNevertheless , modern global warming started c. 1850 , when the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation increased its amplitude and period ( Moore et al .\n2017 ) .\nThe overall multidecadal oscillation ( aka the stadium wave ) currently has a period of c. 65 years , and the 20th century included two rising phases of the oscillation , explaining its two warming phases ( 1915-1945 , and 1976-1997 ; Fig .\n7.1 ) .\nMeridional transport was further reduced during the 20th century by the coincidence of the Modern Solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A long period of above average solar activity between 1935 and 2004 .\nIt is the longest such period in at least 600 years .\nSolar activity acts mainly on stratospheric energy transport , but since it affects the strength of the polar vortex and the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation ( see Part II ) , it also influences tropospheric transport .\nFig .\n7.1 .\nChanges in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and solar activity are consistent with temperature changes .\nTop , above average solar activity reduces poleward transport causing warming .\nBottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Multidecadal Oscillation causes an even bigger reduction in transport and has a bigger temperature effect .\nMiddle , temperature evolution for the past 120 years is consistent with the effect of these two factors on transport .\nData from SILSO sunspots ( top ) , HadCRUT4 deseasonalized temperature ( middle ) , and AMO deseasonalized ( bottom ) , have been smoothed with a gaussian filter .\nAs it can be seen in Fig .\n7.1 , most of the warming during the 20th century can be explained by the combined effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solar Maximum on meridional transport .\nNo other proposed factor can satisfactorily explain the early 20th century warming period , the mid-20th century shallow cooling , and the late 20th century strong warming period , without resorting to ad-hoc explanations .\nIn a single century two periods of reduced transport ( warming ) , coincided with the ascent of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and the effect of the modern solar maximum .\nThis resulted in 80 years of diminished transport that contributed to the greatest warming in 600 years , triggering political and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport changes , and climate shifts The amount of energy transported poleward varies continuously , with major seasonal changes .\nHowever , at certain times the annual average atmospheric transport at high latitudes changes more rapidly over a period of a few years and settles into a different average strength .\nThese abrupt changes in transport are mainly a winter phenomenon , and cause climate shifts on average every 25 years .\nClimate shifts were first identified in 1991 ( Ebbesmeyer et al .\n1991 ) , yet they are not considered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports , despite numerous studies suggesting they are .\nAfter each shift , the climate settles into a new regime .\nIt is known that one of these shifts took place in 1976 resulting in accelerated warming , and another one in 1997 , resulting in decelerated warming ( see Part IV ) .\nThe four known shifts that took place in the 20th century happened soon after solar cycle minimums .\nThe climate regimes , or meridional transport phases , disproportionally affect the Arctic climate in an opposite direction to the climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warming from 1976-1997 was characterized by a quite stable Arctic climate , but the decelerated warming since 1997 has coincided with strong Arctic warming .\nFigure 7.2 shows how the sudden Arctic shift of 1997 was caused by an increase in meridional transport .\nThe only energy that reaches the Arctic in winter is through transport , and the shift was accompanied by an abrupt increase in the amount of energy radiated to space .\nAccording to IPCC theory , without a change in solar energy and/or a change in albedo ( solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a change in outgoing longwave energy could not happen , because energy out must match energy in .\nYet without a significant change in either solar energy or albedo , a significant change in outgoing longwave energy occurred , as shown in Fig .\n7.2 .\nFig .\n7.2 .\nThe change in meridional transport at the 1997 climate shift resulted in an abrupt increase in the amount of energy radiated to space , particularly during the winter .\nThis increase was not compensated for by a corresponding decrease elsewhere .\nClimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not blame the 1976 climate shift on changes in atmospheric greenhouse gases , so they suggest it was caused by a coincidental small reduction in anthropogenic sulfate aerosols .\nThey set the sulphate cooling effect to a point that allowed increasing CO levels to overcome the previous cooling trend in 1976 .\nAs the 1997 shift can not be explained in terms of anthropogenic factors , any data that shows that the shift occurred is ignored , and the focus is shifted to the increased Arctic warming .\nClimate shifts undoubtedly represent changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No theory can successfully explain climate change without accounting for abrupt or gradual changes in transport .\nThe Winter Gatekeeper hypothesis has been developed to explain how climate has changed naturally for the past 50 million years and how it is changing now , integrating into a single interpretation tectonic , orbital , solar , oceanic , and atmospheric causes of climate change .\nIt has tremendous explaining power , and many apparently unconnected phenomena can be linked through it .\nAs an example , changes in wind speed and evaporation are discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to reinterpret their results guided by this new energy transport view of climate change .\nParticularly challenging was to find an explanation for all the previously unconnected evidence of a strong effect on climate from small changes in solar activity .\nThis 220-year-old problem constituted the genesis of the hypothesis .\nThe evidence that small changes in solar activity affect the meridional transport of energy is very solid .\nTwo pieces of evidence are mentioned here .\nThe first is the repeated observation during the past six decades that changes in solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed of rotation ( see Part II ) .\nThis can only be accomplished by solar-induced changes to atmospheric angular momentum that affect the global atmospheric circulation .\nThis is not a small feat for such small changes in incoming energy , and it derives from the dynamical changes caused by UV ( ultraviolet radiation ) absorption by ozone in the stratosphere .\nThe second piece of evidence is that Arctic temperatures display a negative correlation with solar activity .\nThis is not a recent development , as shown in Fig .\n5.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past two millennia by Kobashi et al .\nin their 2015 article \u201c Modern solar maximum forced late twentieth century Greenland cooling.\n\u201d Part of their figure 3 is shown as Fig .\n7.3 .\nFig .\n7.3 .\nGreenland temperature anomaly and solar activity over the past 2100

.\n( C ) Two TSI reconstructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roth and Joos , 2013 in z score .\nThe blue ( red ) areas are the periods of stronger ( weaker ) solar activity corresponding to ( B ) with possible multidecadal lags .\n( E ) Decomposition of the Greenland temperatures into solar-induced changes ( blue ) and hemispheric influences ( orange ) with a regression constant ( \u201331.2\u00b0C ; dots )

influence ( red circle ) on the Greenland temperature .\nFigure from Kobashi et al .\n2015 .\nThe most plausible explanation for Arctic temperature displaying a negative correlation to solar activity is that changes in the Sun regulate meridional transport .\nAn increase in solar activity reduces transport , cooling the Arctic , and a decrease in solar activity increases transport , warming the Arctic .\nThe effect on the temperature in the mid-latitudes is the opposite .\nMore evidence is provided by the relationship between solar activity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Fig .\n5.4 ) .\nWhile this relationship provides an explanation for the Arctic temperature-solar correlation , the polar vortex data can not be extended back in time as much as Greenland temperature data .\n7.4 The explaining power of the Winter Gatekeeper hypothesis Climate research has increased enormously over the past few decades , and frequently changes in climate phenomena are discovered .\nWhen these changes do not fit into the IPCC-sponsored CO hypothesis , and are not properly reproduced by models using greenhouse gas-related theory , they are considered climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community , who are focused almost exclusively on anthropogenic changes .\nThere are many of these phenomena .\nWe have already mentioned the expansion of the Hadley cells ( see Fig .\n4.5f ) .\nWe mention another example here .\nAt the turn of the century , it was noticed that wind speed over land had been decreasing for over two decades .\nThe phenomenon was termed \u201c global terrestrial stilling \u201d ( McVicar & Roderick 2010 ) .\nIt was worrisome because power generation by wind turbines is related to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the 15 % reduction in wind speed observed over the U.S. translated into an almost 40 % reduction in available wind energy .\nThe land wind stilling is puzzling as models do not show it .\nMoreover , it was accompanied by an increase in wind speed over the ocean , so the proposed explanation at the time was that land surface roughness increased due to increases in biomass and land-use changes ( Vautard et al .\n2010 ) , in another example of an ad-hoc explanation .\nThen , unexpectedly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 1997 and 2010 , and since 2010 all land regions in the Northern Hemisphere are experiencing an increase in wind speed ( Zeng et al .\n2019 ) .\nThe explanation turned to internal decadal ocean\u2013atmosphere oscillations , that seemed to correlate .\nIt is unknown to many people , but evaporation over the oceans depends a lot more on wind speed than it does on sea-surface temperature .\nIt was demonstrated that global sea-surface evaporation has closely followed changes in wind speed ( Yu 2007 ; Fig .\n7.4 ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed and evaporation during climate regimes .\nAt the 1976-97 period of low transport/high warming , global ocean wind speed ( black continuous ) increased in parallel to ocean evaporation ( blue dashed ) , while land wind ( red dotted ) entered a period of stilling .\nAt the 1997 climate shift the trends changed .\nData from Yu 2007 and Zeng et al .\n2019 .\nEurope has been chosen because it is downwind of the main transport route to the Arctic in the North Atlantic and responds earlier to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared by wind over all terrestrial Northern Hemisphere regions .\nLisan Yu shows that between the 1970s and the 1990s , \u201c the enhancement of Evp [ evaporation ] occurred primarily over the hemispheric wintertime , \u201d while \u201c the westerlies associated with the [ Aleutian and the Icelandic ] low systems strengthened and expanded southward \u201d ( Yu 2007 ) .\nThe Winter Gatekeeper hypothesis can explain this evidence , which , in turn , supports the hypothesis .\nThe 1976 shift reduced meridional transport due to atmospheric circulation becoming more zonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the oceans while decreasing wind speed over land , because most meridional transport takes place over the ocean basins .\nThe changes were more intense during the winter season , when more energy must be transported poleward , and resulted in a low-transport , high-warming , global climate regime ( Fig .\n7.1 ) .\nAt the 1997 shift the increase in meridional transport was caused by a more meridional atmospheric circulation , decreasing wind speed and evaporation over the oceans while increasing wind speed over land .\nThe climate regime shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is obvious that changes in non-condensing greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosols could not have been the driving force behind these changes in meridional transport .\nThis suggests they have been attributed too much climate sensitivity in climate change theory and models .\nHowever , the changes in transport and atmospheric circulation are clearly associated with changes in evaporation and air moisture that , without a doubt , must affect changes in cloud formation and transport , not forgetting changes in seawater salinity .\nHypotheses that explain recent climate change in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subservient to the Winter Gatekeeper hypothesis .\nThe integration of solar , astronomical , and atmospheric-ocean oscillation changes makes this hypothesis an all-encompassing one .\nIt is more likely to be correct than partial hypotheses .\n7.5 Some questions and comments about the hypothesis Given the complexity of the climate system we do not have answers to every question , nor it is required that we do for the essence of the hypothesis to be correct .\nSome interesting comments came up in the discussions and it is worthwhile to bring them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHere we review a few of the more interesting questions and comments : ( 1 ) Q : Is it necessary that there has been an increasing trend in solar activity since the Little Ice Age ?\nA : While an increasing trend in solar activity since 1700 is defensible , it is not required for the solar part of the hypothesis to be correct .\nAs Fig .\n7.1 shows , it is enough that an above average activity has reduced meridional transport contributing to the warming .\nThe displayed Modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n7.3 provides strong support for the solar-transport link over the past two millennia .\n( 2 ) Q : Is the greenhouse effect required for the Winter Gatekeeper hypothesis ?\nA : Yes .\nIn a thought experiment , it was proposed that a reader imagine that the polar regions are another planet ( B ) that is connected to a planet A made of the tropics and mid-latitudes .\nThe connection allows the transfer of heat .\nThe greenhouse effect in planet B is weaker since its atmosphere has a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a year planet B is in the dark .\nIf more energy is allowed to pass to that planet , it is radiated more efficiently to space and the binary system average temperature decreases , despite planet B warming .\nThe opposite happens if less energy is allowed to pass .\n( 3 ) Q : Why is there no correlation between surface temperature and solar activity if the hypothesis is true ?\nA : Because there shouldn \u2019 t be a correlation .\nAt the multidecadal scale , meridional transport responds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the inter-annual scale , the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation and El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation have a strong effect .\nThe Sun is not dominant at these time-scales .\nThe role of the Sun increases as the time scale lengthens due to its longer-term secular cycles and their longer-term cumulative effect .\n( 4 ) Q : How important is the role of ocean transport in climate change in your hypothesis ?\nA : Oceans store most of the energy in the climate system , and most of the solar energy flows through the ocean before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crucial role in climate .\nHowever , the role of the ocean in meridional transport is secondary to the role of the atmosphere and so is its role in climate change .\nOcean transport is currently considered to be mechanically driven , with winds and tides providing the required energy .\nThe atmosphere transforms heat into mechanical energy , while the ocean does not .\nThis does not diminish the effect of the heat the ocean transports , which is about one third of total meridional heat transported .\nIt also carries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Northern Hemisphere .\nBut the importance of ocean transport decreases with the increase in latitude , and so the Winter Gatekeeper hypothesis can not rely on ocean transport except in a supporting role .\n( 5 ) Q : Do changes in solar activity affect ocean currents ?\nA : Changes in solar output should not affect ocean currents directly because that requires mechanical energy .\nChanges in solar output must necessarily affect the atmosphere first .\nThis is important because it essentially rules out solar hypotheses that propose an initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 ) Q : Does your hypothesis rule out warming from anthropogenic forcing like greenhouse gas emissions , industrial aerosols , and land use changes ?\nA : No .\nIt just leaves a lot less room for them .\nIf the hypothesis is correct , it is unlikely that the anthropogenic effect on climate can account for more than half of the observed warming , and probably much less .\nA : We have not found any evidence for that hypothesis .\n( 8 ) Q : Isn \u2019 t the change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small to affect climate ?\nA : The change in irradiance with the solar cycle is only 0.1 % , too small to change the system energy budget significantly and drive climate change .\nThe ultraviolet radiation part 200-320nm of the spectrum is only 1 % of total solar irradiance energy , and it varies by 1 % with the solar cycle ( 10 times the variation in total energy ) .\nSo , the ultraviolet radiation change responsible for the solar cycle effect on climate is only 0.01 % of the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 0.09 % of the energy change is irrelevant in terms of climate change and has no detectable effect .\nThe solar effect on climate is not about the amount of ultraviolet solar energy , but its dynamical effects in the Earth \u2019 s atmosphere .\n99.99 % of the energy responsible for the solar effect is already in the climate system .\nAn increase in meridional transport reduces its transit time through the system , while a decrease in transport increases its residence time causing the temperature changes .\n( 9 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct because the top of the atmosphere should be in radiative equilibrium and return the same amount of energy it receives .\nA : That statement is incorrect .\nThe radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere is never in equilibrium and the planet is warming or cooling all the time at any time frame considered .\nNobody has ever identified a period when the amount of energy entering the climate system was the same as the amount of energy exiting the climate system .\nThe Earth has no way of returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMany not well constrained feedback mechanisms are responsible for what thermal homeostasis the planet is capable of .\n( 10 ) Q : Stratospheric temperature also shows a shift in 1997 from a declining trend to a flat trend .\nA : Yes , that is evidence of the 1997 climate shift and the ongoing pause despite the 2016 El Ni\u00f1o .\nThe stratospheric temperature trend has the reverse profile to surface temperature trend .\nModels believe this is due to changes in stratospheric CO and ozone , but models and observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 ) .\nThe stratosphere temperature trend is consistent with what is expected if the Winter Gatekeeper hypothesis is correct .\n( 11 ) Q : Scientists are already aware that changes in meridional transport are a possible cause for warming .\nSee Herweijer et al .\n2005 .\nA : The IPCC does not believe changes in transport have significantly contributed to the observed warming since 1951 .\nIf they did it would be included in the natural ( internal ) variability that they have assigned a net zero effect ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reproduce transport correctly , and Herweijer et al .\n2005 is an example .\nModels assume that the sum of ocean and atmospheric transport is nearly constant .\nThis is called the Bjerknes compensation hypothesis ( see Part IV ) .\nIn their model experiment they increase ocean transport by 50 % and observe warming from water vapor redistribution changes ( greenhouse effect changes ) and a reduction in low cloud albedo and sea-ice albedo .\nThe problem is they fail to mention that their model-based proposed mechanism should work as negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet with polar amplification and a reducing latitudinal temperature gradient , a reduction in ocean transport is both implied and observed ( they acknowledge it , referring to McPhaden & Zhang 2002 ) .\nAccording to their model experiment this should drive cooling from transport changes , not warming .\nTheir failure to mention this is misleading , to say the least .\nIn a serious challenge to the model-based Bjerknes compensation hypothesis , researchers have found a strengthening of the North Atlantic Current since 1997 ( Oziel et al .\n2020 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport shown\u2014and referenced in our articles\u2014and in agreement with the Winter Gatekeeper hypothesis .\n( 12 ) Q : Shouldn \u2019 t the tropical convection zones be the main radiators of the planet , responsible for cooling ?\nDirecting heat away from the wet tropics should warm the planet .\nA : That is incorrect .\nMore energy is lost at the tropics than at the poles , but the energy loss at the tropics is essentially capped by deep convection .\nThere is a point when additional downward energy does not increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase convection .\nThe proposal that deep convection acts as a thermostat in the tropics is over 20 years old ( Sud et al .\n1999 ) .\nDeep convection transfers excess energy to the atmosphere but reduces outgoing longwave radiation through cloud formation .\nMost of the energy remains within the climate system .\nThe negative correlation between sea surface temperature and outgoing longwave radiation , once temperature exceeds 27\u00b0C , is a well-known feature of tropical climate ( Lau et al .\n1997 ) .\nThe standard view is that transporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet .\nOur hypothesis and the evidence we have presented supports the opposite view .\n( 13 ) Q : The essence of Arctic amplification in winter is not what you say , but the impact of increasing sea temperatures , the decline in sea-ice and the increase in winter clouds , that are changing the Arctic to a warmer regime .\nA : That is the position of most climate scientists .\nWe disagree .\nThat is the effect .\nThe cause is a change in the amount of heat transported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place quite abruptly in a few years after the 1997 climate regime as shown in Fig .\n7.2 .\nThis increase in heat and moisture transport produced the rapid decline in sea-ice and increase in cloudiness that are features of the new Arctic regime .\nAll consensus Arctic predictions are failing because the situation stabilized in the new transport regime instead of causing positive feedback\u2014the logical conclusion if the consensus position were correct .\n( 14 ) Q : Your view of El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation is incorrect .\nLa Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nA : That is not supported by a frequency analysis of the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation .\nEl Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a are opposite deviations from the neutral state .\nOur analysis shows the frequency of La Ni\u00f1a years displays a strong negative correlation with the frequency of neutral years ( see Fig .\n2.4 ) , not El Ni\u00f1o years .\nAnd the frequency of neutral years follows the solar cycle .\nThere is only one way to interpret this evidence .\nLa Ni\u00f1a and neutral are the alternating states of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As neutral conditions are not opposite La Ni\u00f1a conditions , the oscillator tends to accumulate too much subsurface ocean heat .\nEl Ni\u00f1o resets the oscillator .\nEl Ni\u00f1o frequency depends upon how much extra heat the oscillator collects , which , in turn , depends upon whether the planet , overall , is warming or cooling .\nThis is a very unorthodox view but it is supported by the evidence .\n( 15 ) Q : You show in Fig .\n6.9 that over 85 % of the surface warming shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product of changes made to the temperature datasets since HadCRUT3 .\nIs this correct ?\nA : Yes .\nGlobal annual average surface warming is not only a poor measure of climate change but , since it is calculated as an anomaly to an average , it is also a very small number relative to the accuracy of the measurements , and to the much larger seasonal temperature changes from which it is subtracted .\nThe planet is warming but the numbers used to show it are not as meaningful as we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the warming claimed is due to the way it is calculated , as shown in the figure .\n( 16 ) Q : Do you really believe that you are correct and the IPCC is wrong ?\nA : Paraphrasing Einstein , if the IPCC is wrong it should not be necessary that one hundred authors show it .\nOne is sufficient .\n( 17 ) Q : According to your theory , what should we expect from climate change in the next years and the rest of the century ?\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an expected cooling phase in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation indicate a probable continuation , or even accentuation , of the reduced rate of warming during the first third of the 21st century .\nA modest cooling during this period is possible .\nUnlike the 20th century , this century should contain two cooling phases of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation .\nEven if another extended solar maximum takes place for most of the century , the 21st century should see significantly less warming than the previous one , regardless of CO emissions .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to our interpretation of solar cycles , which is a relief .\nBased on past evidence , a grand solar minimum sets the planet into a severe cooling trend .\n( 18 ) Q : What would be a good test of your hypothesis ?\nA : The expected climate change for the next 30 years , as described above is consistent with several alternative theories to the IPCC \u2019 s , based on the effect of the multidecadal oscillations .\nThe Winter Gatekeeper explains better why the shift took place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for c. 2032 , i.e.\n, three solar cycles .\nThe best test will be when a very active solar cycle takes place , if Arctic amplification turns into cooling and Arctic sea-ice grows it will support our hypothesis .\nIf this happens , proposed alternatives to our hypothesis will be entertaining .", "author": "curryja",

because they take different but complimentary approaches and achieve the same result \u2013 ECS < 3\u00b0C .\nScafetta ( 2022a ) extends and confirm Scafetta ( 2022b ) previously published in GRL .\nLewis study was discussed in a previous post , let us here briefly present the main findings of Scafetta ( 2022 ) .\nThe Coupled Model Intercomparison Project ( phase 6 ) ( CMIP6 ) global circulation ( GCM ) models project equilibrium climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.8 to 5.7\u00b0C .\nTo reduce this range , the 38 GCM were divided into low ( 1.5 < ECS < 3.0 \u00b0C ) , medium ( 3.0 < ECS < 4.5\u00b0C ) , and high ( 4.5 < ECs < 6.0\u00b0C ) ECS subgroups and their accuracy and precision were evaluated in hindcasting the average global surface warming observed from 1980-1990 to 2011-2021 .\nThe study used global surface temperature records are ERA5-T2m , HadCRUT5 , GISTEMP v4 , NOAAGlobTemp v5 , and the satellite-based lower troposphere global temperature UAH-MSU lt v6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satellite-based record was added since surface-based records are susceptible to many biases , including urban heat , among others ( Connolly et al.\n, 2021 ; Scafetta , 2021a ) .\nThe validation tests were conducted using 688 GCM member simulations , 143 average GCM ensemble simulations , and Monte Carlo modeling of internal GCM variability in compliance with three alternative model accuracy requirements .\nThe period from 1980 to 2021 was chosen because it is when the global temperature records are believed to be affected by the least uncertainty .\nMoreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by satellite measurements that offer an independent estimate .\nThe paper \u2019 s key finding was that the vast majority of the simulations by the medium and high-ECS GCMs run too hot .\nFrom 1980\u20131990 to 2011\u20132021 , only the simulation of the low ECS GCM group seems to have accurately predicted the warming shown by the surface-based records .\nFor instance , while all temperature data show a warming below 0.6 \u00b0C , all GCM averages from the medium and high ECS group forecast a warming over 0.6 \u00b0C up to 1.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figures 1 and 2 .\nFigure 2 : Average temperature changes ( 2011\u20132021 minus 1980\u20131990 ) hindcasted by 38 CMIP6 GCMs mean simulations .\nThe blue vertical lines represent the temperature change measured by HadCRUT5 ( infilled data ) , ERA5-T2m , GISTEMP v4 , NOAAGlobTemp v5 , and UAH-MSU-lt v6 temperature records .\nIf internal model variability is also considered , the conclusion remains unchanged because , as the research clearly shows , 95 % and 97 % , respectively , of the medium and high ECS ensemble member simulations run hotter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are summarized in Figure 3 .\nFigure 3 : Boxplots of the CMIP6 ensemble members for each CMIP6 GCM ; # represents the number of the available simulations for each GCM .\nThe horizontal blue lines represent the global surface warming from 1980\u20131990 to 2011\u20132021 reported by HadCRUT5 ( infilled data ) , ERA5-T2m , GISTEMP v4 , NOAAGlobTemp v5 , and UAH-MSU-lt v6 temperature records , respectively .\nFigures 1-3 make it abundantly evident that the warming hindcast by the GCM grows as the ECS increases and that only the low-ECS GCM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the data .\nThe research also demonstrates that the outcome holds true regardless of how statistically the internal variability of the models is modeled .\nMoreover , it is statistically insignificant that a small number of simulations of the medium and high ECS GCMs would seem to coincide with the evidence .\nTherefore , it follows that the actual ECS should be lower than 3 \u00b0C , as Lewis ( 2022 ) also found .\nHowever , Figures 1-3 also show that if the actual warming from 1980-1990 to 2011-2021 is better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also the low-ECS GCM would be running too hot .\nIn fact , while the various available surface-based temperature records show a warming roughly ranging between 0.5 and 0.6 \u00b0C , the UAH-MSU-lt v6 temperature record show a warming of about 0.4 \u00b0C while the low-ECS GCMs show a warming of 0.6\u00b10.1\u00b0C .\nIt is worth mentioning that according to the GCMs , the troposphere should experience a greater warming trend than the surface ( Mitchell et al.\n, 2020 ) so that the UAH-MSU-lt v6 might even be overestimating the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be scaled down by roughly 33 % , assuming that the warming of UAH-MSU-lt v6 is accurate and representative of the warming at the surface .\nThis should imply that the actual ECS might likewise be between 1 and 2 \u00b0C .\nFuture warming would be moderate and not particularly concerning if the actual ECS was between 1.5 and 3.0\u00b0C .\nThe IPCC \u2019 s predictions of future climate catastrophes if CO2 emissions are not severely cut to essentially zero would be unfounded if the actual ECS is considerably lower , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it \u2019 s critical to assess if a warming bias , as multiple studies have already revealed , may be affecting surface-based temperature data .\nTo check the last point , the work adds an extended section where the observed and GCM modelled warming over the land and over the ocean are compared .\nAs a result , the land has warmed 2.0\u20132.3 times faster than the ocean according to surface-based temperature records , 1.5 times faster according to satellite-based temperature records , and somewhere in the middle according to the GCMs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface-based temperature records over land show a warming that is around 0.4\u00b0C more than the satellite readings , whereas the surface-based temperature records over the ocean show a warming that is just slightly larger ( up to 0.1\u00b0C ) than the satellite observations .\nThese results suggest that the warming reported by the surface-based temperature records , especially over land , is too large and incompatible both with the satellite measurements and the land/ocean ratio prediction of the models .\nThese findings imply that the warming indicated by surface-based temperature records , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with both satellite observations and theoretical model predictions of the land/ocean ratio .\nBased on the aforementioned findings , it was determined that the surface-based temperature records may be at least 10 % off when it comes to actual warming .\nBy reducing the ECS of the low-ECS GCMs by 10 % , the ECS range changes from 1.8-3.0\u00b0C to 1.6-2.7\u00b0C , which is in good agreement with Lewis \u2019 s conclusion ( 1.7-2.7 \u00b0C ) .\nHowever , if the real warming is closer to that indicated by the UAH-MSU-lt v6 temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is controlled by multidecadal and millennial natural oscillations that the GCMs are unable to replicate , it is possible that the ECS may be much lower ( for example , 1-2\u00b0C ) .\nFor example , Scafetta ( 2013 , 2021b ) deduced an ECS between 1.0 and 2.3 \u00b0C by assuming ( solar-astronomically induced ) natural climatic oscillations of quasi 20 , 60 , 115 and 1000 years , which are observed in many climatic data throughout the Holocene but not reproduced by the GCMs .\nThe same result is obtain using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the GCMs use solar forcings taken from the solar proxy reconstructions that show the least secular variability ( Connolly et al.\n, 2021 ) .\nBecause they imply that anthropogenic global warming for the upcoming decades will inevitably be moderate , the results by Scafetta ( 2022a ) and Lewis ( 2022 ) cast serious doubts on climatic

Part I: Wind and Solar \u2013 The More You Do, The Harder It Gets", "content": "There seems to be a belief that increasing the level of wind and solar projects will make subsequent progress with these resources easier .\nNothing could be further from the truth .\nIncreasing penetration levels of wind and solar is like a Sisyphean task , except that it is worse .\nThe challenge may be better understood as akin to pushing a huge rock which is getting heavier and heavier , up a hill of a steeper and steeper slope while the ground below gets slicker and more unstable .\nThe problems associated with increased penetration swamp any potential benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale .\nThe bulk power system has traditionally been strong and very robust .\nThere are generally not significant problems associated with adding small system elements ( small amounts of wind and solar ) which lean on the system , rather than support it .\nThe system has a limited ability to absorb wind and solar power and can use it to displace generation which relies on costly fuels .\nBut at higher penetration levels this ability is greatly reduced and the economics can degrade and even reverse .\nListed below are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewables will lead to rapidly increasing costs as well as rapidly decreasing reliability .\n1 ) Wind and solar do not readily supply essential reliability services .\nConventional generation has characteristics that support the stability and operation of the grid .\nThey have inertial mass and spin in synchronism with the wave forms powering the system while readily providing voltage and frequency support .\nAs wind and solar make up a larger percentage of the generation resource base we see an erosion of these desirable characteristics .\nSome argue that electronic emulation can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these characteristics but it is costly and the results are inferior .\nPrevious writings going into detail on this topic include : https :

availability/output often does not match or support system needs .\nWhile there is hope for battery technology , current goals are modest .\nOther resources must compensate for the intermittency of wind and solar .\nThe greater the percentage of wind and solar the greater the challenge and cost for backup .\nPrevious writings on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success of wind and solar installations is highly location specific .\nYou can pull up maps showing the suitability and appropriateness of various locations for both wind and solar power .\nOther land use considerations make locations more or less suitable for wind and solar as well .\nCurrent effort to increase wind and solar make use of the most optimal sites .\nRemaining sites are less optimal .\nAs penetration levels increase above current levels the suitability of potential sites will decrease .\nThe posting below cowritten with Rud Istavan provides some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wind and solar depend on materials which must be mined and their ability may be limited .\nGreatly increasing solar and wind production will likely increase costs and create supply problems .\nEuropean wind power is already seeing a fight over scarce materials .\n5 ) As wind and solar generation increase penetration it will become more and more challenging for other resources to subsidize their expansion .\nIt \u2019 s one thing to subsidize a small component of the generation mix , another thing entirely to subsidize the major components .\n6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build wind and solar facilities .\nTheir operation and support consume a lot of energy .\nMany see that it is doubtful that such facilities can support themselves , serve load and provide enough energy to build replacement facilities of the same sort .\nAdditionally , if electric vehicles are thrown in , the problem is further magnified .\nThe \u201c green \u201d plan to eliminate gas appliances and added losses from increased battery deployment will not help either .\nThere are a class of concerns focusing on all the energy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis is referred to as the energy density or power density problem .\nHere are a couple links ( here , here , here and here ) discussing these type concerns .\nThese concerns have been outside my area of experience .\nI hope that readers may add more references in the comments .\n7 ) Wind and solar make the study , control and operation of the power system more complicated and uncertain .\nThese resources are intermittent and more unpredictable for operators to contend with .\nTo maintain stability good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run involving complex differential equations .\nPlanners can force builders of large power plants to provide pretty good data on the plant impacts .\nGetting good data for dispersed projects with many small elements which might change during a project and after installation is much more challenging .\nLastly , system operators and planners have years of experience with large rotating machines , not as much with wind and solar .\n8 ) Widespread deployment of wind and solar would require that power be transmitted across great distances ( or you would need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage . )\nGetting wind \u2019 s power from the plains to the population centers involves long transmission lines .\nGreen advocates argue that imbalances between load and generation from solar and wind resources can be overcome by drawing on resources from a broader geographical area .\nThis requires even greater needs for long power lines and a robust grid .\nWind and solar produce DC power which must be converted , with the help of the grid , to AC power .\nEdison and Tesla had a battle years ago over AC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to transmit power a long distance you need to use an alternating current system .\nAs noted in item 1 , solar and wind do not provide sufficient elements like inertia and vars for such a system to remain stable .\n( Side note-A high voltage DC line can transmit power great distances with lower losses .\nHowever , to utilize a high voltage DC line it is imperative to have a strong AC system receiving the power .\nThe system must be robust such that the power can be converted from DC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be the savior of a wind and solar based system . )\nWhile high levels of wind and solar penetration require a robust grid , their greater presence reduces the capability of the grid .\nThe above is a formidable list of challenges .\nHow might they be overcome ?\nNot by economies of scale from increased wind and solar production .\nFirst off , it \u2019 s hard to imagine that any economies of scale would allow these resources to leap the formidable challenges described above .\nSecondly , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economies of scale are to be expected .\nMy perusal of the topic shows that attempts to find economies of scale have all failed .\nBuilding more and more smaller units likely will not provide greater economies of scale due to increased material costs .\nLarger wind and solar facilities incur a class of costs not seen by smaller facilities .\nPromoters of wind and solar argue instead that smaller local projects provide more benefits than might be obtained from larger facilities .\nCould nuclear energy be a piece of a lower carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the above concerns apply to nuclear power .\nWe could see cheaper costs from standardized nuclear facilities and reasonable regulations .\nHydro too works well with the power system .\nUnfortunately , there are negligible to no potential locations to expand hydro generation .\n( Note-pumped storage is an option for storing energy , but not producing additional net energy ) .\nIt is way too soon to be envisioning a 100 % renewable future with significant contributions from current wind and solar capabilities .\nIt is not a good strategy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retire and prohibit conventional generation hoping that a miracle will occur when we need it .\nPerhaps with the extensive deployment of nuclear power , carbon capture and other technologies we might be able to approach a zero-carbon grid .\nAt best , current wind and solar technologies will play at most a small part in such a plan .\nThis is the

Part II:  Will the Inflation Reduction Act Cause a Blackout?", "content": "The \u201c green \u201d provisions of the poorly named Inflation Reduction Act are sweeping and it appears they may do more harm than good .\nThe philosophy behind the inflation Reduction Act seems to reflect the belief that if you can get the ball rolling , adding additional wind and solar will get easier .\nHowever , as Part 1 discussed , the compounding problems associated with increasing the penetration level of wind and solar generation are extreme .\nReplacing conventional synchronous generating resources , which have been the foundation of the power system , with asynchronous intermittent resources will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute to blackout risk .\nThe power system is the largest , most complicated wonderful machine ever made .\nAt any given time , it must deal with multiple problems and remain stable .\nNo resources are perfect ; in a large system you will regularly find numerous problems occurring across the system .\nGenerally , a power system can handle multiple problems and continue to provide reliable service .\nHowever , when a system lacks supportive generation sources , it becomes much more likely it will not be able function reliably when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dry wood and flammable material can be sparked from many potential sources , or a very unhealthy person could succumb to many different threats , a weakened power system is more vulnerable to many conditions than a robust one .\nIn this post I discussed responsibility for the Texas winter blackout .\nMany things went wrong that day in Texas .\nBut often many things do go wrong \u2013 the real problem was that the Texas market did not provide incentives for standby resources .\nIn Texas there were not enough committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels and potential contingencies .\nTexas relied on an energy market designed to favor wind and solar resources and it failed them .\nHowever , many analyses of the Texas blackout focused on the proximate conditions ( problems of the sort that are common ) ignoring or denying the major underlying problem .\nWe are seeing blackouts and system problems all over the world now , unlike in the past .\nThere is a common factor for most \u2013 high penetration of intermittent asynchronous wind and solar generation .\nThis commonality is generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vested interests focus on the triggering conditions .\nThere are always going to be potential triggering conditions .\nNo one anywhere will eliminate triggering conditions so absolving green resources of blame because such things exist in the real world only makes sense as theater .\nWhen faced with \u201c green \u201d outages , focusing on the proximate triggers serves to protect \u201c green \u201d interests and helps mask the emerging greater problems to come .\nThe Inflation Reduction Act is promoting a system with less stability , robustness and reliability .\nBesides describing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to major outages , I will conclude this article by identifying a specific type of outage likely to become more common due to provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act .\nBefore describing how the ACT impacts the system , I will take a detour and describe a specific past incident where a system element which was valuable at one penetration level became a system detriment at a higher penetration level .\nA heat pump is an efficient way to heat or cool .\nAs a refrigerator transfers the heat out of the refrigerator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool or freeze your food while making your house warmer , a heat pump can transfer heat between a home or building and the outdoors .\nIn the winter it transfers heat from the outdoors to the interior .\nIn the summer it transfers heat from the house to the outdoors .\nWith a heat pump you don \u2019 t \u201c create \u201d heat you merely use a small amount of electricity to efficiently transfer heat in the preferred direction .\nEven when the temperature is cold outside a heat pump can extract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to warm a home or residence .\nAs the temperature drops below 40 degrees .\nHowever .\nheat pumps become less efficient and as temperatures drop below freezing , the home must be heated with a backup method , usually resistance heating .\nResistance heating makes the process more expensive and inefficient .\nIt is possible to exchange heat with a source below the ground or a source of water to get around this problem , or alternatively to provide heat from natural gas backup , but these approaches have not worked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBecause of their behavior at colder temperatures , heat pumps are not appropriate for all parts of the country .\nIn the north the many hours they would have to run with resistance heat makes them both environmentally irresponsible and too expensive .\nNatural gas is a better option .\nThey work where it is hot enough some of the year that air conditioners are installed anyway ( thus they don \u2019 t increase the summer peak ) and where it is cold but not too cold at most times .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days a year that does not cancel the net benefits , but with longer time periods the benefits are lost .\nEncouraging heat pumps was all the rage , when I first started working in the southeastern US .\nMost entities in the south did not see winter peak loads , so adding heat pump load in the winter was a great thing .\nIt was a win , win , win situation for all involved .\nThe economics work generally the same for all utilities , but I will describe how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-ops pay a demand charge based on their peak load and an energy charge based on their kwh usage .\nResidential sales are on a kwh usage , so the peak charge must be recovered through the kwh charge imposed on residential customers .\nThe better a Co-ops \u2019 load factor ( total kwhs sold/ ( peak demand*total hours ) the lower their rate can be set .\nHeat pumps did not raise the demand charge , but increased energy sales and allowed the demand charge to be spread out over more energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Builders were rewarded with free underground distribution if they committed to building all electric homes which relied on heat pumps .\nRebates were given for heat pump installations and often those installing heat pumps were rewarded with free water heaters .\nMy company had a big marketing division supporting the work of the distribution cooperatives to support efforts at increasing ground source heat pumps .\nIt worked well , almost perfectly .\nThe only drawback was that on very cold days the heat pumps would switch to resistance heating and this made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels , raising heating costs a lot that day .\nBut with incentives and the saving at most times , those costs were not that significant .\nThe overall winter load increased a lot on those days , but it was still below the summer peak at most times .\nPlus , when it \u2019 s cold you can put a little more load on the power lines and fossil fuel generators can provide more power without overheating .\nSo , the heat pumps did not contribute to increasing fixed costs .\nEverything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heat pumps increased .\nBut there was a cloud on the horizon .\nLooking ahead it seemed like that within the decade our winter peak would move to surpass the summer peak .\nThis meant that the winter peak would soon drive the need for improvements and expansions .\nUnfortunately , what should be technical disagreements are often political problems as well .\nIn a battle of experts , the consultants working for the marketers disputed the trend .\nThe programs continued and everything was great in the short term .\nSooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it hit hard and it hit regularly .\nOn the coldest days when the resistive heating kicked in , peak demand rose sharply and swiftly .\nThe winter \u201c needle shaped \u201d peak drove investment and costs .\nThe mostly residential cooperatives who had invested big in the heat pump programs had to pay rates based on their demand during the new winter peak , greatly raising their average energy costs .\nWhile almost no one wanted to see it coming , once the effects hit , most everyone in the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a terrible blow to rural electric cooperatives who had invested big to improve their load factor , only to find they had subsidized a worse winter load factor .\nResidential customers are not charged for contributing to peak demand ( the meters don \u2019 t measure that ) so for them their contribution to the demand charges has no significant penalty .\nFor customers in this region , it still makes sense to put in heat pumps so the problems continue to grow for some to this day .\nThe Inflation Reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In looking at the grid , you should not make one goal a priority but should instead seek to balance competing objectives .\nSee Balance and the Grid for a discussion of how efforts to maximize one objective without due attention to other major goals can result in a worsening condition for all goals .\nIt seems apparent that all the \u201c green \u201d measures in the Inflation Reduction Act were included because independently they all seem capable of reducing carbon .\nI have not seen any evidence that any consideration was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might interact to create problems .\nThe green measures encouraged by the inflation Reduction Act will lead to generic blackouts in many situations as described earlier in this essay and in Part 1 .\nPresented below is a chart from a previous posting , tiled \u201c Will California \u201c learn \u201d to avoid Peak Rolling Blackouts ?\n\u201d The projected peak that was causing blackout concerns was only around 10 % above the average for the previous year \u2019 s included in the chart .\nThe specific prediction of an outage condition I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions .\nWinter peaks can be extreme , much more so than summer peaks .\nAs temperatures climb in the summer , air conditioners reach a saturation point .\nThe climb in summer peak demand with each additional increase in temperature typically flattens out .\nIn the winter each additional degree drop can increase demand more than the one before .\nThere are a lot of potential sources of resistive heat that increase demand .\nIn severe cold more and more come ?\nheating elements come into play and the increase in demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPeak winter loads tend to hit just before sunrise .\nThe system sees a rapidly rising peak , often described as needle shaped , which drops as the sun comes up and temperatures warm .\nThe act encourages solar at the bulk , distribution and residential levels .\nSolar will be of no benefit during such a peak , but does serve to push out other resources which might support the system during such conditions .\nPlus , there is a double whammy .\nSolar power supply supplied to the grid will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time homes usually supplemented with solar will be putting maximal demands on the grid .\n( Note -The infrastructure needs to supply a home which only puts a demand on the system a few hours a year concurrent with other uses maximum demand is basically the same as the infrastructure need to support a full requirements home .\nIt is challenging to collect that from such customers .\nWhen there are rate challenges and it \u2019 s difficult to collect system costs , needed infrastructure often is delayed . )\nIn any case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns around winter morning peaks .\nThe act encourages wind development .\nLike solar , wind will push other better suited resources out of the supply pool .\nWind is generally slower just before sunrise and winter is not generally peak wind season .\nIn any case wind is intermittent and some of the times during cold weather wind is not available .\nSome say that wind tends to rise up as temperatures get colder and there are ways to keep turbines from freezing , .\nNonetheless , we do see freezing problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is not a guarantee .\nGreen resources perform much better in theory than practice .\nAt least at sometimes wind power will not likely be a great asset during winter morning peaks demand conditions .\nThe act encourages efficiency .\nThis could help to reduce load and thereby make severe outages less likely .\nBut the real problem with peak demand is the difference in demand during the extreme peak period and other more normal high load periods .\nIf efficiency reduces load , you will likely see a reduction in generating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high load levels .\nThe risk from peak conditions is more attributable to the delta between the winter peak demand and more common high load levels .\nThis is because regular loads drive generation additions more than extreme conditions .\nI don \u2019 t know that efficiency measures work better during the most extreme winter temperatures than it does at normal winter cold temperatures ( probably less so ) , therefore its mitigating impact may be small to none .\nAlso , there are those who might argue that consistent with Jevon \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy consumption .\nThe basic mechanism , behind this counterintuitive theorem , is illustrated by mechanisms observed such as individual consumers with more efficient homes choosing to heat more rooms or increase comfort because you get more for your money in an efficient home .\nSolar , wind and efficiency are intended to decrease fossil fuel-based resources .\nCombustion turbines and hydro are generally the most appropriate resource for limited duration demand surges .\nThe expansion potential of hydro is very limited and this resource can not make up for lost combustion turbines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively well in cold conditions and old mostly useless units traditionally have been called on to get the system through short term peak demand conditions .\nTo be fair the Act does encourage energy storage and that should help somewhat with peak demand concerns .\nCare is needed as batteries do not give their best performance in cold temperatures .\nBut in light of all the other changes that is a huge burden to place on technology at this stage of development .\nThe chart below shows the US typical resource generation by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chart will look as fossil fuel is phased out .\nHydro only makes up about 6 % of the mix and expansion there is limited .\nNuclear could replace these resources but it is not great for ramping up and down to follow needle peaks .\nIf wind and solar step up to replace fossil fuels this leave us vulnerable to energy shortages during winter peaks just before daybreak .\nBattery capability would need to be huge , expansive and probably would not be procured in advance of demonstrated needs .\nIt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast winter system demand just before daybreak in the green future .\nBut one more feature of the Clean Air Act helps raise concerns to an even higher level .\nThe Inflation Reduction Act subsidizes ground source heat pumps !\nHeat pumps are attractive to the Inflation Reeducation Act for only one reason .\nThey help reduce the demand for gas furnaces .\nSubsidies will be available in areas where today heat pumps are not considered practical .\nToday it doesn \u2019 t make sense to drive resistance heating with electricity generated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and environmentally unsound .\nHowever , you can theorize that if all electricity is green , inefficient electric heat is green too .\nReplacing natural gas heat with heat pumps is not a good idea when one considers their impact on the power system during winter peak conditions .\nUnder the Acts subsidy provisions people who live in areas where heat pumps don \u2019 t make sense may decide to get them anyway with the subsidy .\nFor example , if you live in a cooler area and you \u2019 ve gotten by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be subsidized and the resistance heat will be there for you in the winter too .\nGreen advocates talk of shaping the load to better use resources , but that evidently can be quickly forgotten when other green objectives emerge .\nPutting in a bunch of heat pumps and building tremendous infrastructure to support their short-term demands is far from environmentally responsible .\nWith a lot of help from the Inflation Reduction Act we will likely see these full set of conditions in many areas : \u2022 Backup quick start fossil fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the resource mix , \u2022 Nuclear , hydro and battery resources are tapped out \u2022 Solar is absent from the distribution side and not available on the generation side \u2022 Wind may or may not be blowing \u2022 Heat pumps are operating maxed out in resistance mode , along with other resistive heating to drive system load to extreme heights \u2022 As with every power system there will be a few problems on the system \u2022 System will be forced to deliberately shed a lot of load or may go unstable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed by some , climate change is driving more extreme winter peaks in the near term , we may see the situation sooner than later .\nIn any case green measures are driving us there with current historical weather patterns .\nBeing without heat and power in extremely cold conditions is highly problematic for most individuals , businesses and industries .\nWhat can be done to prevent such blackouts ?\nUnfortunately , not much attention seems to have been paid to concerns of this sort .\nIt might be argued we need vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not paying attention may argue we need more solar ) to support winter load .\nThe cost and environmental impact of these extra mostly underused resources would be large and prohibitive .\nThis would be true weather the resources were wind , solar , batteries or nuclear .\nKeeping older already manufactured combustion turbines around for emergency conditions would be a much more reasonable means of mitigating risks .\nThe additional environmental impacts of using something already manufactured and placed in service are small compared to building extensive new resources , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be .\nHow do we encourage smart ways to provide emergency capacity ?\nCurrent energy policies are seeking to direct as much money toward \u201c green \u201d resources and costs away from them .\nAs discussed earlier , in Texas they are moving away from recognizing capacity value consistent with a trend towards energy only markets .\nI \u2019 m a big fan of markets , but they don \u2019 t do a good job of protecting against extreme conditions especially when no one has ultimate responsibility ( except governmental entities ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures would need to be employed to compensate for providing and ensuring combustion turbines are available for emergency conditions .\nBut no one seems to be talking about such measures .\nThe Inflation Reduction Act appears to be a single focus approach to a nuanced problem .\nCut CO2 emissions and hope for great innovations .\nReliability threats apparently are not on their radar , nor are they an articulated or contemplated concerns .\nIt \u2019 s a shame because reduced reliability can wreak havoc on the economy and the environment .", "author": "curryja", "url":

.\nNot least they may come to realize that some of our apparent shortcomings are not signs of irrationality or failure , but manifestations of our unique ability to cope with the enormous uncertainties of life .\nThere is , I hope , something for everyone.\n\u201d Part I : \u201c Three important ideas are discussed in Part I .\nThe first is that a type of geometry\u2014what I call the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stable and predictable for much of the time , and yet their future behaviour becomes completely uncertain on occasion .\nThe second idea applies to systems that are so complex , we will never be able to model them exactly .\nIn such situations , adding noise to a model can be a good way to represent some of the missing complexity .\nIn this way , noise is often a positive constructive resource , and not the nuisance we typically think it to be.\n\u201d Part I deals with topics that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Physics course ( in the 1970 \u2019 s ) , so I don \u2019 t have much of a framework for interpreting this .\nHistorical and philosophical perspectives are combined with the scientific exposition .\nIt is a very interesting read and for the most part understandable with my limited background ( my interest flagged a bit in Chapter 4 ) .\nPart I sets the stage for Parts II and III .\nPart I is PopSci \u2019 s favorite : \u201c In terms of this broad enlightening nature , the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out head and shoulders above the rest .\nPalmer starts by exploring chaos and gives the best explanation of the behaviour of chaotic systems , state space and attractors I \u2019 ve come across .\nThen he throws in Cantor sets , then shows the relationship of weather forecasts to all this , and introduces p-adic numbers ( arguably the only bit that could have been better explained ) .\nHe then shows graphically ( literally , not metaphorically ) how the introduction of noise can make models of chaotic systems work better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes on quantum uncertainty , with one of the only explanations of the use of Bell \u2019 s inequality I \u2019 ve ever seen that is at least vaguely comprehensible.\n\u201d Part II : \u201c We apply the ideas discussed in Part I to develop practical tools for predicting complex , inherently uncertain systems .\nThe key idea here is ensemble prediction : running our models multiple times while varying uncertain initial conditions and model equations .\nWhen the spread of a reliable ensemble system is small , we can make fairly precise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the spread is large , we can make forecasts only using the language of probability .\nIn this way , the geometry of chaos is manifest in the variable spread of the ensemble .\nEnsemble prediction methods are applied to weather and climate ( where the techniques are reasonably mature and well validated ) , and to disease , economics and conflict ( where techniques are still in development ) .\n\u201d Part II is to me the liveliest part of the book , with real world applications of the ideas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinating account of the history of weather forecasts , including numerical weather prediction .\nThe focus of the chapter is Monte Carlo methods that provide the basis for ensemble weather prediction , providing the basis for assessing forecast uncertainty , including Palmer \u2019 s central contributions .\n( Chapter 6 on Climate Change is discussed in the final section of this review ) .\nIn the other chapters of Part II , Palmer speculates on how ensemble forecast approaches could benefit epidemiological models that forecast pandemics , economic models and their failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars/conflicts .\nFrom PopSci : \u201c things really liven up when we get onto economics , and how economists are stuck in the fairly useless state meteorologists were before the great storm of 1987 , when they used single-run forecasts , rather than ensembles .\nHe also shows fairly bluntly that economists have failed in the development of the kind of models that can handle a chaotic system like the economy.\n\u201d Chapter 10 on decisions illustrates real world examples for using ensemble weather forecasts to support decision making \u2013 including Peter Webster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Bangladesh .\nPart III : \u201c Two key ideas from Part I are applied to try to understand two of the most puzzling aspects of the universe : the world of quantum physics and ourselves .\nWe start by assuming that the geometry of chaos applies to the universe as a whole .\nThis leads to the crucial idea that certain counterfactual worlds , where we might have done something but didn \u2019 t , could actually be inconsistent with the laws of physics .\nThis helps make comprehensible certain long-standing quantum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that the human brain makes constructive use of noise to model the world around us , and that this has enabled us to become the creative species we are .\nI then speculate that the geometry of chaos can help explain two of our most visceral but puzzling experiences : having free will and being conscious.\n\u201d Part III is more speculative .\nChapter 11 describes Palmer \u2019 s new thinking on quantum uncertainty , incorporating the geometry of chaos .\nPretty interesting .\nChapter 12 \u201c Our Noisy Brains \u201d is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book .\nPalmer hypothesizes that the human brain makes constructive use of noise in trying to create a low-order model of the high-order world around us .\nHe argues that such noise is a key element in making us creative , innovative beings .\nPalmer extends Daniel Kahnemann \u2019 s thinking fast and slow by considering the brain \u2019 s energetics in describing these modal operation of the brain .\nIn the low power mode ( thinking fast ) , when the brain is multi-tasking and is more susceptible to noise , random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments .\nIn this framing , creativity involves a synergy between the low-power ( stochasticity , noise ) and the power-intensive ( deterministic ) modes of thinking .\nChapter 13 extends these ideas to include a role for quantum physics in counterfactual reasoning in the brain in relation to what human \u2019 s regard as free will .\nTwo reasons to highlight Chapter 6 on Climate Change : this is a climate blog ; and the first major review of this book focuses on the climate change issue ( see the Scientific American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good overview of the greenhouse effect , feedbacks , etc .\nand also the history of climate modelling .\nPalmer describes his concerns about global climate models , and his plan for the next generation of climate models at much higher resolution .\nIn line with the major themes of the book in terms of uncertainty and ensemble prediction : \u201c Indeed , it \u2019 s simply not possible to describe climate change in an objective , scientific way without explaining the three roles of ensembles : for estimating the uncertain feedback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impact of climate policy on climate change ; and for separating the effects of natural chaotic variability from human-induced effects .\nFrom the first way of using ensembles , we can address how big an impact our emissions of greenhouse gases are having on global temperatures .\nWith the second set of ensembles , we can assess whether mitigating actions can be effective or not .\nAnd from the third set of ensembles , we can not only assess the extent to which observed changes in weather and climate are natural ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can try to attribute specific weather events to climate change , at least in a probabilistic way.\n\u201d The more interesting part of the Chapter addresses the question in the chapter subtitle : \u201c Catastrophe or Just Lukewarm ?\n\u201d Palmer addresses how we should view climate change from a perspective that is consistent with the \u201c primacy of doubt , \u201d treading carefully around the \u201c merchants of doubt \u201d meme .\nBoth sides of the argument are reviewed , which are referred to as the \u201c maximalist \u201d and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 he concludes : \u201c Let \u2019 s summarise .\nTaking a specific position\u2014minimalist , maximalist or indeed any specific point in between\u2014is simply inconsistent with the science .\nThe key message of this chapter is that one \u2019 s attitude to climate change , like to weather prediction , should be framed in terms of risk : Is the risk of undesirable changes to climate high enough to warrant taking precautionary action now ?\n\u201d Palmer takes on this question more directly in Chapter 10 Decisions !\nDecisions !\nPalmer introduces the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when expressed in terms of GDP per capita ) can be applied to both developed and developing country inhabitants .\nHis conclusion is that it is overwhelmingly worthwhile to take action now to reduce the risk of a 4 degree \u201c hell on earth \u201d warmer world at an assumed 30 % probability .\nHard to disagree with that conclusion related to 4C warming , but the devil is in the assumption of 30 % probability of 4 C warming .\nWith RCP8.5 increasingly being regarded as implausible , and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound of equilibrium climate sensitivity at 4C , the chances of 4C warming are now generally regarded as quite small .\nSomething here for both the maximalists and minimalists to find unsatisfactory .\nAs an example of how this is unsatisfactory to the maximalists , the first major review of the book in the Scientific American is entitled Uncertainty can speed up climate action .\nThe title speaks for itself .\nAny book that mentions climate change , particularly one by a renowned scientist , is expected by the climatariat to urge action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review : \u201c But Palmer struggles to frame both the uncertainties of climate change and the severity of its effects .\nHe tees up the chapter ( subtitled \u201c Catastrophe or Just Lukewarm ?\n\u201d ) by defaulting to a both-sides approach : Are the \u201c maximalists \u201d right to suggest we \u2019 re in an emergency and should decarbonize as much and as quickly as possible , or are the \u201c minimalists \u201d right in suggesting that uncertainty is grounds for delaying action ?\nThe truth , he writes , is somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide alone would warm the planet by one degree Celsius .\n( That \u2019 s without factoring in feedback loops it might cause , such as the loss of ice cover or more water vapor in the atmosphere , which would further turn up the heat . )\nThis is , he says , \u201c perhaps not something to make a big deal of.\n\u201d ( JC note : this statement about 1 C is taken out out of context of Palmer \u2019 s overall argument ) .\nThen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , clearly with Merchants of Doubt in his brain , seeks to educate Palmer about climate change : \u201c But look at a planet that is already one degree warmer today than in preindustrial times , and the view is quite alarming .\nThat incremental shift has fueled unprecedented heat waves on every continent , set the American West ablaze with ferocious intensity , and led to deadly deluges in areas that have never experienced such extreme back-to-back rainfall .\nFurther , the most recent IPCC report , which Palmer urges his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dire picture that would seem to support a more maximalist view .\nCamille Parmesan , an ecologist at the University of Texas at Austin and one of the lead authors on that report , said in February 2022 that \u201c we \u2019 re seeing adverse impacts are being much more widespread and being much more negative than expected in prior reports.\n\u201d The Primacy of Doubt makes a compelling case for either reducing uncertainty or operating with confidence in the \u201c reliability \u201d of the uncertainty that remains .\nBut it can obscure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt \u2019 s impossible not to ponder how overlooking such nuances might sit with readers prowling for reasons to brush off the urgency of new climate policies.\n\u201d JC recommendation to readers : Don \u2019 t waste your time reading this book if all you are looking for is confirmation of your predilection for ( or against ) urgent reductions of fossil fuel emissions .\nRead this book if you have an intellectual curiosity about physics , chaos , uncertainty and their applications across the sciences .\nThis remarkable book will surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such understanding will lead to better understanding of how we think and make decisions .\nMost refreshingly for a book that is at least partly in the climate space , this book does NOT attempt to tell us what to think or which decisions to make .", "author": "curryja",

Gatekeeper Hypothesis: New support for the effect of solar activity on lower atmospheric circulation", "content": "A recent paper by Svetlana Veretenenko provides important support for the effect of solar activity on the lower atmospheric circulation through its effect on the polar vortex .\nVeretenenko \u2019 s paper is an important step in demonstrating the solar effect on global atmospheric circulation , an important part of the Winter Gatekeeper Hypothesis .\nThe Winter Gatekeeper Hypothesis , proposed by this author in his book \u201c Climate of the Past , Present and Future \u201d ( Vin\u00f3s 2022 ) , is based on evidence that climate change is primarily the result of changes in poleward energy transport , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modulator of this transport .\nThe hypothesis addresses two important issues : How climate changes naturally on the multi-decadal to the millennial time scale , even in the absence of changes in the greenhouse effect ; and how changes in solar activity can profoundly affect climate despite their small energy changes .\nOne conclusion of the hypothesis is that the Modern Solar Maximum of 1935-2005 contributed to 20th-century global warming , implying a significant reduction in climate sensitivity to carbon dioxide .\nThe reader is referred to parts III , IV , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Winter Gatekeeper Hypothesis \u201d series of articles for additional information on meridional ( poleward ) transport mechanisms , and to part VII for a summary of the hypothesis .\nThe Winter Gatekeeper Hypothesis integrates different components of the transport system in the stratosphere , troposphere , and ocean .\nA schematic of the energy processes involved is presented in Fig .\n8.1 , with energy transport represented by white arrows .\nSolar modulation starting in the stratosphere affects all transport , and Vin\u00f3s ( 2022 ) showed a solar effect on ENSO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which solar activity modulates ENSO activity is still unknown , but this author proposes a solar modulation of the Brewer-Dobson tropical upwelling , known as the \u201c tropical route \u201d of the \u201c top-down mechanism \u201d ( Maycock & Misios 2016 ; Vin\u00f3s 2022 ) .\nFig .\n8.1 .\nNorthern Hemisphere winter meridional transport outline .\nThe energy gain/loss ratio at the top of the atmosphere determines the maximal energy source in the tropical band and the maximal energy sink in the Arctic in winter .\nIncoming solar energy is distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is subjected to different transport modulations .\nEnergy ( white arrows ) ascends from the surface to the stratosphere at the tropical pipe ( left dashed line ) and is transported towards the polar vortex ( right dashed line ) by the Brewer\u2013Dobson circulation .\nStratospheric transport is determined by UV heating at the tropical ozone layer , which establishes a temperature gradient affecting zonal wind strength through thermal wind balance , and by the quasi-biennial oscillation ( QBO ) .\nThis double control determines the behavior of planetary waves ( black arrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergoes a biennial coupling with the QBO ( BO ) .\nIn the tropical ocean mixed-layer , ENSO is the main energy distribution modulator .\nWhile the Hadley cell participates in energy transport and responds to its intensity by expanding or contracting , most energy transport in the tropics is done by the ocean .\nChanges in transport intensity result in the main modes of variability , the AMO , and PDO .\nOutside the tropics , most of the energy is transferred to the troposphere , where synoptic transport by eddies along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the transport to high latitudes .\nThe strength of the polar vortex determines the high latitudes winter climate regime .\nA weak vortex promotes a warm Arctic/ cold continents winter regime , where more energy enters the Arctic exchanged by cold air masses moving out .\nJet streams ( PJS , polar ; TJS , tropical ; PNJ , polar night ) constitute the boundaries and limit transport .\nRed oval , the part of the Winter Gatekeeper Hypothesis studied in Veretenenko 2022 .\nFigure from Vin\u00f3s 2022 .\nThe effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first reported by Karin Labitzke in 1987 , is better understood .\nThere is now considerable evidence that solar activity affects the state of the polar vortex .\nThe mechanism , which was already proposed in the 1970s , is called \u201c Planetary Wave Feedback \u201d ( Gray et al .\n2010 ) .\nThe amount of energy and momentum impinging on the polar vortex depends on the state of the stratosphere that is affected by solar activity .\nDuring periods of low solar activity , more energy is delivered , perturbing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under high solar activity .\nThe stability of the polar vortex is of fundamental importance for the winter climate of the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes and for the amount of energy reaching the Arctic .\nThe Winter Gatekeeper Hypothesis puts this known solar mechanism into context as part of a more general effect of solar activity on meridional transport through the stratosphere and troposphere from the tropics to the poles .\nIt also shows that the important climatic effect of transport changes is due to changes in the amount of energy leaving the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions .\n\u2022 Polar Vortex and Its Role in Atmospheric Processes The recent paper by Svetlana Veretenenko , from the Ioffe Institute in St. Petersburg , Russia ( Veretenenko 2022 , Ve22 from here ) , provides important support for the effect of solar activity on the lower atmospheric circulation through its effect on the polar vortex .\nVeretenenko \u2019 s paper focuses only on the troposphere-polar vortex part of the Winter Gatekeeper Hypothesis ( Fig .\n8.1 , red oval ) .\nIt also lacks an explanation of the energetic changes necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gatekeeper Hypothesis has provided such an explanation through changes in outgoing radiation ( Vin\u00f3s 2022 ) .\nNevertheless , Veretenenko \u2019 s paper is an important step in demonstrating the solar effect on global atmospheric circulation , an important part of the Winter Gatekeeper Hypothesis .\nIt is not uncommon in science for unrelated authors to independently reach similar conclusions at about the same time .\nThe Winter Gatekeeper Hypothesis was already developed in 2018 and was included in the first edition of \u201c Climate of the Past , Present and Future.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 years ago because there was insufficient knowledge and data to support it .\nThe time has come to make a major breakthrough in our understanding of natural climate change and the role of the sun in it .\nThis author is proud to be a part of it and welcomes Veretenenko \u2019 s paper \u201c Stratospheric Polar Vortex as an Important Link between the Lower Atmosphere Circulation and Solar Activity.\n\u201d The main findings of this article are discussed below .\nVe22 defines the polar vortex and its role in atmospheric processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ) Distribution of mean monthly velocity of zonal wind ( in m\u00b7s\u22121 ) at the 20 hPa level ( stratosphere ) in the Northern Hemisphere in January 2005 .\n( b ) distribution of mean monthly magnitude of the horizontal gradient of temperature ( in \u00b0C/100 km ) at the 20 hPa level in January 2005 .\nFigure from Ve22 .\nFig .\n8.2 constitutes a nice illustration of the winter gatekeeper concept .\nThe strong winds that circle the poles in winter act as a gatekeeper determining how much energy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating a steep temperature gradient .\nThe strength of the polar vortex is tied to the Northern Hemisphere winter atmospheric circulation : 3 .\nSpatial and Temporal Variability in Galactic Cosmic Ray Effects on Troposphere Pressure Ve22 believes that the solar effect is mediated by galactic cosmic rays , but we must remember that solar activity , often assessed by sunspots or the 10.7 cm radio flux , is strongly correlated with the inverse of cosmic rays , as shown in Fig .\n8.3 .\nThere is a lag of about one year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a correlation of climate effects can not be interpreted as evidence for cosmic ray involvement , since the lags can arise independently .\nVe22 correlates solar activity with atmospheric pressure , as has been done previously by many authors since the Labitzke and Van Loon studies of the 1980s .\nVe22 also points out the correlation reversals that have taken place in the solar-climate signal , extensively discussed in Parts I , II , and IV .\nFig .\n8.4 .\nSpatial distribution of the correlation coefficients between mean yearly values of geopotential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cosmic rays rate for the period 1982\u20132000 .\nCurves 1 and 2 show the climatic positions of Arctic fronts in January and July , respectively .\nSimilarly , curves 3 and 4 are the same for Polar fronts ; curves 5 and 6 are the same for the equatorial trough axis .\nThis figure corresponds to Figure 3a from Ve22 and has been modified by the addition of land contours and a yellow box for what Ve22 calls the North Atlantic cyclogenetic zone ( zone of most intensive cyclone formation ) along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20\u201330\u00b0 N , 280\u2013300\u00b0 E , and 30\u201340\u00b0 N , 290\u2013310\u00b0 E ) .\n4 .\nTemporal Variability of Solar Activity Effects on Troposphere Pressure in the Northern Hemisphere and the Epochs of Large-Scale Circulation For longer temporal analyses , Ve22 uses the sunspot number as a proxy for solar activity and its correlation with sea level pressure in two areas , the North Atlantic cyclogenic zone ( yellow box in Fig .\n8.4 ) or the polar region ( 60-85\u00b0 N ) .\nAs we can see in Fig .\n8.4 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas is opposite .\nFig .\n8.5 shows that their opposite correlation with solar activity is maintained over time , but undergoes reversals at certain times .\nFig .\n8.5 .\n( a ) Correlation coefficients between yearly values of sea level pressure and sunspot numbers R ( SLP , SSN ) for the Polar region ( solid line ) and the North Atlantic cyclogenetic zone ( dashed line ) for sliding 15-year intervals .\nDotted lines show the 95 % significance level .\n( b ) Fourier spectra of sliding correlation coefficients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Ve22 .\nVe22 takes the dates of the correlation reversals rather than the dates on which the trends change , so it misses known climate regime shifts identified in the Pacific , such as the one in 1976 that precedes the correlation reversal of the early 1980s by about six years .\nThis prevents Ve22 from relating the detected changes to a more global phenomenon involving meridional transport by the multidecadal stadium-wave oscillation that shows the same 65-year frequency ( Vin\u00f3s 2022 ) .\nMoreover , unlike the Winter Gatekeeper Hypothesis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reversals , something that has puzzled solar climate researchers for a century .\nVe22 supports the correlation between solar activity and atmospheric pressure with a similar analysis using the atmospheric circulation index ( Vangengeim-Girs ) that this author also used in Vin\u00f3s 2022 Fig .\n11.10d .\nVe22 correctly identifies the relationship between solar activity and meridional circulation , which is one of the bases of the Winter Gatekeeper Hypothesis .\n5 .\nEvolution of the Polar Vortex as a Possible Reason for Temporal Variability in Solar Activity Effects on the Lower Atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmospheric circulation and its changing correlation with solar activity to changes in the state of the polar vortex .\nUsing reanalysis , Ve22 shows a period of strong stratospheric vortex from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s , characterized by stronger zonal winds at 60-80\u00b0N and lower polar temperatures .\nWeaker vortex phases occurred in the two decades before and after that period .\nMore controversial are Ve22 findings on surface changes in sea-level pressure and temperature in the Arctic region .\nThis makes little sense , as a strong vortex creates a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature .\nThe data bear this out , as the Arctic has experienced intense winter warming since the 1997 shift to a weaker vortex phase , not the cooling shown in Figure 7 of Ve22 .\nThis author suspects a problem with Ve22 figure 7 or with the polynomial trend removal methodology .\n6 .\nDestruction of Cloud-Galactic Cosmic Rays Correlation : Possible Role of the Vortex Weakening Ve22 next examines the correlation between the low cloud anomalies and cosmic rays that formed the basis of Svensmark \u2019 s theory .\nAs Ve22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Ve22 attempts to relate the end of the correlation to a change in the polar vortex .\nIn this author \u2019 s opinion , the attempt is unsuccessful .\nSvensmark \u2019 s theory requires a direct effect of cosmic rays on cloud condensation nuclei .\nIt is not possible to justify that more cosmic rays go from inducing more clouds to inducing fewer clouds .\nHowever , Ve22 attempts to do so by substituting an unspecified effect on cyclogenesis for the physical effect of cosmic rays on condensation nuclei .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s theory to maintain the hypothesis that solar effects on atmospheric circulation are due to cosmic rays .\nThe explanation that the effects are due to dynamical changes initiated by changes in UV rays mediated by stratospheric ozone ( the \u201c top-down \u201d mechanism ; Maycock & Misios 2016 ) , supported by considerable evidence and incorporated into the Winter Gatekeeper Hypothesis constitutes a simpler , more specified , and better-supported alternative .\nNext , Ve22 goes into a highly speculative and rather lengthy discussion of the possible effects on the polar vortex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to geomagnetic activity , magnetic storms , and solar wind .\nShe even argues for a 60-year periodicity in total solar irradiance that is not observed in sunspots .\nShe also raises the possibility that changes in the chemistry of the middle atmosphere are involved in variations in the strength of the polar vortex .\nThis author finds it surprising that the main factor known to affect polar vortex stability , the planetary wave feedback mechanism ( Gray et al .\n2010 ) , is not considered in this paper .\n\u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circulation of the lower atmosphere reveals a roughly 60-year periodicity that seems to be associated with changes in the epochs of large-scale circulation\u2026 \u2022 In turn , changes in the circulation epochs seem to be related to the transitions between the different states of the stratospheric polar vortex\u2026 \u2022 The state of the polar vortex may be affected by different solar activity phenomena contributing to a roughly 60-year oscillation of its intensity\u2026 The first two are clear and supported by the evidence .\nAs advocated by the Winter Gatekeeper Hypothesis , meridional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and characterized by distinct states of the winter atmospheric circulation and polar vortex strength .\nThe periodicity of this multi-decadal transport oscillation , which also involves the oceans , is c. 65 years .\nSolar activity is one of the main modulators of meridional transport changes through its action on three control centers : the tropical ozone layer , the polar vortex ( also identified by Ve22 ) , and ENSO ( Vin\u00f3s 2022 ) .\nFor the first time in a hundred years , a mechanism has been proposed to explain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the evidence and includes the ability to alter the planet \u2019 s energy budget through coincident changes in outgoing energy .\nIt explains how a very small change in UV energy in the stratosphere is able to alter the meridional transport of energy making it easier or harder for the planet to conserve energy .\nVe22 provides evidence for the solar activity \u2192 polar vortex \u2192 atmospheric circulation connection and identifies the polar vortex

climate sensitivity arm .\nThe interviewer , Max Rauner , an experienced science journalist with a PhD in physics , focused mainly on clouds , however Stevens also had interesting things to say about

@ @ @ @ @ Stevens : See that cloud out there ?\nIn my field , most people think of a cloud as these compact white objects in the blue sky .\nZEIT : Just like in the children \u2019 s book .\nStevens : Yes , a pretty fluffy cloud .\nAs if you could draw a line around the edge of the cloud .\nBut that \u2019 s an optical illusion , as anyone who \u2019 s climbed into a cloud in the mountains knows .\nStevens : Exactly .\nClouds are tricksters .\nEven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud structure is more like that of puff pastry .\nNevertheless , many scientists use the children \u2019 s book clouds as a guide because they are easier to simulate .\nThis makes the climate models less accurate .\nZEIT : How much water does this cloud contain ?\nStevens : A cloud the size of an old building can only hold a

millimeter thick .\nZEIT : Why then do clouds affect the climate so much and flood entire countries ?\nStevens : Flooding occurs because clouds can be huge and air circulation during storms constantly replenishes the water .\nAnd they affect the climate because they are made up of a huge number of droplets that interact with sunlight and thermal radiation .\nA very large cloud has almost as many droplets as there are stars in the universe .\nAnd there are many clouds .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planet ?\nStevens : Both .\nThe energy balance of the earth has two parts : firstly , the incident sunlight and secondly , the heat given off by the earth , i.e .\ninfrared radiation .\nAll clouds have a cooling effect by reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches the earth \u2019 s surface .\nAnd all clouds have a warming effect by absorbing the earth \u2019 s infrared radiation so it doesn \u2019 t escape into space \u2013 the greenhouse effect .\nThe balance sheet shows : Water-rich low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest cooling effect and low-water ice clouds at high altitudes have the strongest warming effect .\nOverall , the cooling effect is greater .\nZEIT : And how does this balance change with global warming ?\nScientists from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research ( PIK ) recently published a worst-case scenario .\nIt also mentions that by the end of the century our planet could get so warm that all the clouds are practically evaporating and we are doomed .\nStevens : That \u2019 s nonsense .\nPut simply , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises .\nIt \u2019 s hard to get rid of clouds .\nZEIT : Why do the Potsdam climate researchers claim otherwise ?\nStevens : You \u2019 ll have to ask them that .\nI can only admire how the colleagues there comb through the specialist literature for the most alarming stories .\nI find it a pity that these are then presented uncritically .\nZEIT : So the scenario is wrong ?\nStevens : Yes .\nIt is based on a work by our institute taken out of context and on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stevens : The dramatic behavior of the climate in this simulation was based on an oversimplification of the clouds , which has nothing to do with reality .\nIf you look closely , the most alarming stories often don \u2019 t stand up to scientific scrutiny .\nZEIT : Do you also mean tipping point forecasts such as the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet , the collapse of the Gulf Stream and the desertification of the Amazon rainforest ?\nStevens : Yes , and most others .\nOf course , the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warming , even more dramatically in some regions .\nBut how , where and when is far from certain .\nZEIT : In the German climate discourse , the PIK usually warns of tipping points , while your institute tends to downplay the danger of tipping points .\nWhy is that ?\nStevens : Tipping points are fascinating , and there \u2019 s a good chance they exist .\nBut they are also a matter of definition .\nWhat do you think of when you hear the word tipping point ?\nZEIT : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nStevens : An accelerating change that can not be reversed , right .\nLike a pencil falling down .\nHe can not fall back up by himself .\nBut the tipping points highlighted by my colleague Hans Joachim Schellnhuber and others at PIK are based on their private , much weaker definition .\nTipping points are reinterpreted to include less abrupt or even reversible climate changes .\nWith this redefinition , they find tipping points everywhere .\nThen the alarm goes off .\nMy institute does not play down tipping points , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nZEIT : Do you envy the Potsdam Institute for its media presence ?\nStevens : Who doesn \u2019 t want to be interesting ?\nUnfortunately , people prefer stories about the end of the world .\nI don \u2019 t understand much about that .\nZEIT : Are you saying that global warming is not a problem ?\nStevens : It \u2019 s a huge problem , partly because we know so little about its actual impact .\nAccording to the IPCC , whether and where biblical droughts and floods will occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ZEIT : Stefan Rahmstorf from PIK compares himself to a doctor who found out that smoking is dangerous and now has to call on people to stop .\nStevens : As a scientist , I like to explain to people how things I understand work .\nBut what qualifies me to tell them how to behave ?\nThat must result from the social discourse , which should be shaped more by good journalism than by charismatic scientists .\nIf people don \u2019 t learn to think for themselves , we \u2019 re lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds is still overrated \u201d ZEIT : Let \u2019 s talk about the danger of clouds again .\nWill Clouds Accelerate Global Warming ?\nStevens : The interesting number here is climate sensitivity .\nIt quantifies how much the earth will warm up if the CO\u2082 concentration in the atmosphere doubles\u2026 ZEIT : \u2026compared to the CO\u2082 concentration before industrialization .\nThat would still be in this century ?\nStevens : If we continue as before , yes .\nIn the last IPCC report , it was agreed that the global average temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4.0 degrees Celsius .\nAccording to the simulations , the higher temperatures are mainly caused by a change in the clouds .\nWe consider this effect to be overestimated today .\nStevens : Yes .\nToo many children \u2019 s book clouds , not enough real clouds .\nIn the world climate research program we have tackled the climate models .\nThe models with the most extreme predictions have failed , and confidence in the less catastrophic values of climate sensitivity has increased .\nIn my opinion , however , the contribution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : How great is it ?\nStevens : Based on our latest measurements and advances in theory , I would say today : zero .\nStevens : Right , at least that \u2019 s my working hypothesis .\nThe climate sensitivity is then at the lower end of the IPCC estimate , around 2.8 degrees .\nWe should keep looking , but so far there \u2019 s no evidence that clouds play a major role .\nThe original German version of the above interview , updated October 19 , 2022 at 4:50 pm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of interest , if , in the light of Bjorn Stevens \u2019 comments , one were to replace the cloud feedback estimate given in the recent IPCC Sixth Assessment Report ( AR6 ) with a zero estimate , the AR6 feedback-based estimate of climate sensitivity would reduce by 27 % .\nApplied to the AR6 3.0\u00b0C central estimate of climate sensitivity , that reduction would change it to 2.2\u00b0C , identical to the feedback-based estimate in my recent paper that estimated climate sensitivity using multiple lines of evidence .", "author": "niclewis", "url":

the penetration problem for renewable energy in Texas The Electric Reliability Council of Texas ( ERCOT ) operates Texas \u2019 electric power grid that serves 25 million customers in Texas .\nERCOT \u2019 s sources of generating are natural gas ( 51 % ) , wind ( 24.8 % ) , coal ( 13.4 % ) , nuclear ( 4.9 % ) , solar ( 3.8 % ) , and hydroelectric or biomass-fired units ( 1.9 % ) .\nPower demand in the ERCOT region is typically highest in summer , primarily due to air conditioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region \u2019 s all-time record peak hour occurred on July 8 , 2022 , when consumer demand hit 78,204 MW .\nThis article describes an extended lull in wind and solar power during the period 8/1/22 \u2013 9/12/22 .\nI then describe what it would take in terms of a system with 100 % renewable generation plus storage to produce sufficient electric power for Texas during such a lull .\nFor background , read these previous articles by Planning Engineer : \u2022 The Penetration Problem .\nPart I : Wind and Solar \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it Gets \u2022 The Penetration Problem .\nPart II : Will the Inflation Reduction Act Cause a Blackout ?\nAugust 2022 temperatures for Texas were fairly typical \u2013 hot ( daily high temperatures frequently broke 100oF ) , but not exceptional .\nTexas temperatures during the first two weeks of September were slightly cooler than normal , with daily maximums in the high 80 \u2019 s as a wet pattern enveloped most of the state .\nWhat was exceptional about this period was an extended lull in both wind and solar power in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual electricity demand ( load ) for ERCOT during the period 8/1/22 \u2013 9/12/22 vs combined wind and solar production of electricity .\nDuring this period of lull in renewable energy production , the demand loads were pushing into the mid and upper 70 GW range .\nWhat would it take for a hypothetical electric power system to meet such a demand solely with wind and solar power ?\nTexas saw wind generation fall to 600 MW or lower with demand loads of 41-43 GW in the early AM hours when solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either 75 times wind capacity or a crapton of batteries .\nEither way , massive amounts of battery storage are needed in ERCOT for a 100 % wind/solar/hydro grid .\n400 \u2013 450MWh of batteries would be needed to cover the extended wind lulls around Aug 22nd and Aug 30th , and during both events the batteries would be drained to 5-15 % of capacity .\nCome the next day , you need excess energy to charge them so they can be used again the following night .\nThe deepest discharge period ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time lasted for 63 hours and required a discharge of ~940 MWh while only charging ~75 MWh over that time period .\nClearly , a massive buildout of wind and solar would be needed to cover that gap .\nTwo scenarios are considered here , using back-of-the-envelope calculations .\nScenario # 1 : if you increase wind and solar 8 times current capacity AND add 900 GWh of battery storage , you would have been able to cover that month-long period with 100 % renewables ; this turns out to be much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nScenario # 2 : wind at 4.05 times current capacity and solar at 8.45 times current capacity with 5000 GWh of battery storage .\nYes this whole scenario is rather sketchy , but how much would it actually cost ?\nFor Scenario # 1 , 8X the current wind buildout and 8X the current solar buildout ( 364,000 MW ) plus 900,000 MWh of battery storage , the cost would be $ 800 billion + transmission .\nThis calculation assumes that the charge/discharge of the batteries is 100 % ; if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another 10-15 % of battery storage .\nAdditional transmission lines cost $ 2 to $ 5 million per mile .\nScenario # 2 is much more expensive than Scenario # 1 .\nThe scenario costs are based on the following cost assumptions ( see References at end of post ) : Compare this with an estimated cost of nuclear power at $ 9 million /MWh , whereby that same amount of money for renewables ( $ 800 billion ) could build over 90 GW of nuclear power vs the 230,000 MW of renewables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewable generation stack plus the buildout of nuclear power ( red line ) .\nUsing that money to build out nuclear power instead would yield more power than ERCOT would need for the coming few years even with steady load growth AND would use < 1 % of the land area of the renewables .\nIf you site the nuclear power plants at old coal facilities and outdated gas plants , the transmission interconnection is already there and costs would decrease as more nuclear capacity is built .\nThe recent month long period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUT that is what electricity grids need to be designed for .\nAssuming the 8xWind and 8xXolar + 900,000 MWH of batteries , this is what the summer would have looked like from a supply standpoint with batteries fully charged .\nA little overkill , IMO .\nRemember this assumes the charge and discharge of the batteries is 100 % efficient , if you use a more realistic estimate you need to increase the battery storage by 10-15 % Power production from wind and solar hardware typically decays at 0.5 % per year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half way through their lifecycle it adds up to BIG numbers .\nLoad growth as well needs to be taken into account , with 82 GW possible in the coming summer for peak demand .\nERCOT has been averaging ~2 \u2013 3 % growth per year .\nSince ERCOT is more or less an isolated grid , it is a good example for an academic/economic exercise such as this .\nWith such an overbuild of wind and solar for ERCOT , there would be a great deal of curtailed/wasted power once the batteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hypothetical wasted power for the recent Aug/Sept period with the 8xWind , 8xSolar and 900,000MWh batteries .\nThe grid would have wasted/lost a total of 37.54 TWh to serve a total load of 63.17 TWh .\nIf you want to transport that power elsewhere , remember it costs $ 2 to $ 5 million per mile for new transmission lines .\nWind and solar are cheaper to build , but not when you take into account the overbuild and storage to fully serve the grid .\nWhen total costs are considered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also having the

\u2019 t what it used to be .\nCirca 2013 with publication of the IPCC AR5 Report , RCP8.5 was regarded as the business-as-usual emissions scenario , with expected warming of 4 to 5 oC by 2100 .\nNow there is growing acceptance that RCP8.5 is implausible , and RCP4.5 is arguably the current business-as-usual emissions scenario .\nOnly a few years ago , an emissions trajectory that followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was regarded as climate policy success .\nAs limiting warming to 2 oC seems to be in reach ( now deemed to be the \u201c threshold of catastrophe \u201d ) , [ i ] the goal posts were moved in 2018 to reduce the warming target to 1.5 oC .\nClimate catastrophe rhetoric now seems linked to extreme weather events , most of which are difficult to identify any role for human-caused climate change in increasing either their intensity or frequency .\nThe main stream media is currently awash with articles from prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than we thought .\nHere are some prominent articles : \u2022 NYTimes David Wallace-Wells : Beyond catastrophe : A new climate reality is coming into view .\n\u2022 WSJ : Good climate change news is fit to print .\nSlowly its percolating into the journalistic mind that recent research is upbeat David Wallace-Wells is one of the most interesting journalists writing in the climate space .\nIn 2017 , he wrote a 2017 New York Magazine article titled \u201c The Uninhabitable Earth \u201d , with subtitle : \u201c Famine , economic collapse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What climate change could wreak\u2014sooner than you think.\n\u201d Not long after publication of his book in 2019 entitled The Uninhabitable Earth , David Wallace-Wells made this statement : \u201c Anyone , including me , who has built their understanding on what level of warming is likely this century on that RCP8.5 scenario should probably revise that understanding in a less alarmist direction.\n\u201d DWW scores HUGE number of points with me for quickly adjusting his priors with the growing amount evidence that RCP8.5 is implausible .\nWell , the \u201c messaging \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are succeeding with reducing emissions ( no we are not ) .\nThe second message is to acknowledge that that warming will be less than we thought , but the impacts of the warming will be worse than we thought ( nope ) .\nThe third message is that advances in science have brought us to this ( relatively ) happy place ( nope ) At the heart of this good news is abandonment of RCP8.5 from UNFCCC policy making .\nThe hero of science behind this abandonment is Justin Ritchie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work has been cited in previous RCP8.5 posts at Climate Etc ) .\nThe COP26 and now the COP27 have quietly dropped RCP8.5 ( and SSP5-8.5 ) from their considerations , focusing on the envelope between RCP4.5 and RCP2.6 .\nThe grand poohbahs of the IPCC apparently didn \u2019 t see this coming ( or preferred to keep spinning the alarm ) , since they instructed climate modelers for CMIP6 to continue a focus on SSP5-8.5 , and climate researchers continue to focus on this scenario in their impacts publications .\nThe IPCC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did make this lukewarm statement The second so-called scientific advance is lower values of climate sensitivity .\nThe so-called advance is associated with the IPCC AR6 decision NOT to include values derived from climate models ( which have dominated previous IPCC reports ) .\nThey implicitly acknowledge that climate models are running too hot and that you can pretty much get whatever value of climate sensitivity that you want from a climate model ( this has been blindingly obvious to me and many others for over a decade ) .\nThe IPCC AR6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 4.0oC ( from 4.5oC previously ) ; this further acts to reduce the amount of projected warming .\nThe IPCC AR6 also raised the lower likely bound of ECS to 2.5oC ( from 1.5oC ) .\nRaising the lower bound of ECS is on very shaky ground , as per the recent publication by Nic Lewis The COP27 is working from a value of expected warming of 2.5oC by 2100 .\nThis is arguably still too high for several reasons .\nIPCC expert judgment dismissed values of climate sensitivity that are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been dismissed as per Nic Lewis \u2019 paper ) .\nFurther , the IPCC projections do not adequately account for scenarios of future natural climate variability .\nSee these recent posts : In addition to an insufficient number of solar and volcanic scenarios , the climate models ignore most solar indirect effects , and the climate model treatment of multidecadal and longer internal variability associated with ocean circulations are inadequate .\nWhile in principle these factors could go either way in terms of warmer vs cooler , there are several reasons to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooler during the remainder of the 21st century : \u2022 Baseline volcanic activity since 1850 has been unusually low \u2022 Most solar researchers expect some sort of solar minimum in the mid to late 21st century \u2022 Solar indirect effects are inadequately treated by climate models , which would act to amplify solar cooling \u2022 A shift to the cold phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation is expected in the next decade , which influences not only global temperatures but also Greenland mass balance and Arctic sea ice .\nOnce you include alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 2100 could easily be below 2oC and even 1.5oC .\nRecall that this warming is with reference to a baseline of 1850-1900 ; 1.1oC warming has already occurred .\nDavid Wallace-Wells provides some \u201c hope \u201d for the climate alarmists with this sentence : I just don \u2019 t know what further to say here .\nThe IPCC AR6 provides very meager fodder to support DWW \u2019 s statement .\nApart from sea level rise , which is unambiguously associated with global warming , there is no prima facie reason that extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate .\nObservational evidence , provided that you go back at least to 1900 , shows that nearly all horrible , recent weather and climate disasters have precedents in the 20th century and hence \u201c detection \u201d is very challenging .\nClimate models are not fit-for-purpose to simulate extreme weather events , let alone to attribute them to human caused warming .\nWe are then left with back-of-the-envelope simple thermodynamic calculations to infer worsening of extreme weather events , which ignores the overwhelmingly dominant role of atmospheric and oceanic circulations .\nThink about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible impacts are highly sensitive to a 0.5oC temperature change .\nIf so , this leads to the conclusion that the dominant climate factor is natural climate variability , with year-to-year swings of several tenths of a degree from El Nino and La Nina , a substantial volcanic eruption , and/or multidecadal ocean oscillations .\nThe rationale for ignoring natural climate variability is based on the assumption that large amounts of fossil-fueled warming from climate model simulations spiked by RCP8.5 and high values of ECS will swamp natural climate variability .\nCut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further ) , and you lose the rationale for ignoring natural climate variability .\nSo is all this a \u201c victory \u201d for climate science ?\nI don \u2019 t think so .\nBut I told you so .\n.\n.\nAnd finally Bret Stephen \u2019 s article includes this all important figure .\nAre we to infer that warming causes fewer deaths ( well there is a STRIKING correlation ) ?\nWell maybe , but the real cause of this decline is increasing wealth , increased warnings , and adaptation to weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate events are something that needs to be dealt with independently of the AGW issue .\nThe world has always suffered from weather and climate extremes , and it always will ; this will not change with further warming or with emissions reductions .\nThe policy implications of all this is enormous .\nUnfortunately I suspect that the COP27 will focus too much on emissions reductions ( which aren \u2019 t working and wont impact the climate in any event ) , and not enough on supporting development and adaptation for developing countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by allowing them to benefit from their fossil fuels ( other than by selling them to Europe ) .\nWith regards to the later , a shout out to Rose Mustiso \u2019 s recent Nature

resilient , and equitable world.\n\u201d \u2022 \u201c Advocacy and the media will help build the narrative for supporting our schools in moving toward climate action , solutions , and environmental justice.\n\u201d \u2022 \u201c In fact , education has been identified as an underutilized social tipping point needed for decarbonization \u2014 the process of phasing out reliance on carbon across all parts of the economy.\n\u201d Efforts to insert climate-related activism into all aspects of the curricula are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science , history , critical thinking , etc .\nin the curricula .\nThe responsibility of adults is to teach children and young adults how to solve problems effectively , not to preach the end of the world .\nAdults also need to help children become more resilient .\nThe concept of psychological hardiness is an important one in many contexts ( discussed previously at CE ) , but particularly with regards to children .\nThe father of hardiness , Salvatore Maddi , defined hardiness as \u201c the pattern of attitudes and skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of potential disasters into growth opportunities \u201d ( Maddi , 2014 ) .\nThere are three qualities of hardiness : challenge , control , and commitment .\nThese qualities affect how one structures interactions with his or her environment and sustains the motivation necessary to persevere through life \u2019 s stressors .\nAn individual who has the quality of challenge acknowledges that stressors are normal in life and sees them as opportunities to learn and grow by actively engaging with them .\nAn individual who has the quality of control attempts to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when circumstances are poor , rather than being passive or believing himself to be powerless .\nFinally , an individual who has the quality of commitment is predisposed to be involved with the people and organizations around him as opposed to acquiescence to alienation .\nHardiness is positively related to a sense of meaningfulness and enhances performance and health .\nHardiness is also negatively related to depression and anxiety .\nRelated to anti-hardiness of young people , the book The Coddling of the American Mind describes how parents \u2019 attempts to promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes them more emotionally fragile .\nThe book argues that by succumbing to their own sense of fragility and wrapping themselves in the cloak of victimhood , young people are developing cognitive patterns similar to those of people suffering from anxiety and depression .\nHardiness in children is related to how children deal with stressful situations [ link ] .\nThere is a well-documented increase in anxiety and depression over the past five decades .\nThese studies suggest that risky or uncertain situations are opportunities for growth , which can provide children with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-efficacy .\nInstead of encouraging risky activities , parents and care-providers are becoming more restrictive .\nBy encouraging children to take risks , parents and educators can help children to build characteristics of hardiness .\nAs such , hardiness is similar to the concept of anti-fragility ( discussed previously at CE ) .\nHardiness alters two appraisal components made by an individual : it reduces the appraisal of threat and increases one \u2019 s expectations that coping efforts will be successful .\nHardiness is associated with the individual \u2019 s use of active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stressful events .\nThese two mechanisms reduce the amount of psychological stress one experiences .\nTeaching these skills to children can help them to tackle challenges with a positive attitude while also enabling them to independently reduce the psychological stress that is associated with these challenges .\nApart from ill-advised parenting , children and young adults are being used as tools in national and international political campaigns and are encouraged to be seen as \u2018 victims \u2019 .\nBlaming this unfortunate situation of psychological stress on a changing climate is incorrect , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political goals is reprehensible behavior that is acting to reinforce the childrens \u2019 psychological injuries .\nSo much for \u201c saving the planet for the grandchildren.\n\u201d These depressed children often talk of not having their own children in the future because of climate change ( such sentiments feature prominently in the Complaints organized by Our Childrens \u2019 Trust ) .\nThis is a pretty big backfire for the \u201c suffer now so we can save the planet for the grandchildren \u201d crowd .\nJC note to the brainwashing educators of K-12 children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression are in no kind of shape to be effective activists .\nFurther , in a decade or so , when it is apparent that there is no climate catastrophe , these young adults are not going to be very trustful of information from the establishment .\nThe most famous child activist in the world is Greta Thunberg ( now 19 years old ) .\nI find Greta to be a remarkable individual in many ways .\nHer earlier activism seemed manipulated by adults ; now as a young adult herself , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person .\nWhile I find her often mistaken in her conclusions and ensuing statements , I do not question her honesty or motives .\nThere are other comparable young activists that I \u2019 ve seen reference to in Africa and Latin America ( but I can \u2019 t easily find these ) .\nGreta is often lumped in ( inappropriately ) with the teen/young adult thugs that ( under the sponsorship of Extinction Rebellion , Just Stop Oil and others ) are gluing themselves to roads to stop traffic , throwing tomato soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well maybe this is a step up from selling drugs , but maybe not .\nLast week in Germany , a bicyclist died because climate activists were blocking the roadway for emergency vehicles , preventing them from reaching the accident scene [ link ] .\nAt first blush one might classify these young protestors as morons , but I suspect they are actually being paid very well for their transgressions ( perhaps even reflecting hardiness by seizing an economic opportunity ) .\nThe Climate Emergency Fund ( CEF ) seems to be coordinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heiress to the Getty oil fortune , and the Getty Foundation have apparently provided more than $ 4M in funding to the Climate Emergency fund .\n.\nRory Kennedy ( daughter of Robert F. Kennedy ) is on the board of the CEF .\nSenior figures at CEF also include members of the film-making and publishing elite [ link ] .\nExtinction Rebellion is also bankrolled by the Gettys , Kennedys and other billionaire families .\nThe Equation Campaign was launched in 2020 with a $ 30M pledge from two members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockefeller oil fortune [ link ] .\nAnd people criticize Elon Musk for wasting his fortune on things like Twitter .\n.\n.\nThe bottom line is that these protests are not grassroots activism , but are funded by millionaires , quasi-charities and shadowy foundations .\nWhat is needed is a counter organization analogous to Our Children \u2019 s Trust that provides litigation support for people and institutions that are harmed by the actions of these activist organizations .\nSue organizations such as CEF , the individuals on their Board of Directors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these organizations .\nI \u2019 m no lawyer , but the family of the bicyclist that was killed in Germany seems to me to have a much stronger case for a lawsuit than the lawsuits sponsored by Our Childrens \u2019 Trust based upon childrens \u2019 psychological injuries .\nIt is difficult to avoid concluding that children are being used as tools in adults \u2019 political agenda surrounding climate change .\nThis tooldom is having adverse impacts on the mental health of children and young adults .\nI find the K-12 educational brainwashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWouldn \u2019 t it be much better for the children to learn about geology and meteorology , mass media influences on politics and society , and critical thinking about big societal issues ?\nWouldn \u2019 t it be great to motivate students to want to contribute to solving society \u2019 s problems and give them the academic tools to take advantage of opportunities ?\nBut a more fundamental issue is how children are being raised , so that they are lacking in resilience and hardiness .\nAnd finally , there are near- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that throwing tomato soup at paintings in museums is helping the \u201c cause \u201d ?\nIn the longer term , all of this propaganda and brainwashing will backfire when it becomes apparent in a decade or two that there is no climate catastrophe , and young adults are rebelling against the \u2018 establishment \u2019 .", "author": "curryja", "url":

glaciers and climate in my archives ; maybe I can help Reilly ( and the \u201c real scientists of Montana \u201d ) understand what is going on .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered by glaciers shrank 70 % from the1850s to 2015 , according to US Geological Survey .\nMelting began at the end of the Little Ice Age ( circa 1850 ) when scientists believe 146 glaciers covered the region , as opposed to 26 in 2019 .\nThe first surveys of glaciers in Glacier National Park began in the 1880s , with most of the focus on the two largest glaciers \u2013 Grinnell and Sperry .\nA 2017 publication issued by the U.S. Geological Survey entitled Status of Glaciers in Glacier National Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the areal extent of named glaciers in the Glacier National Park since the Little Ice Age ( LIA ) with markers at LIA , 1966 , 1998 , 2005 and 2015 .\nAnalysis of these data show : \u2022 A ~50 % loss from LIA to 1966 ( ~115 years ) , averaging a loss of ~4.5 % per decade .\n\u2022 Additional ~12 % loss from 1966-98 ( 32 years ) , averaging a loss of ~3.7 % per decade .\n\u2022 Additional ~4.75 % loss from 1998-2015 ( 27 years ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per decade .\nMuch of the glacier loss occurred prior to 1966 , when fossil-fueled warming was minimal .\nThe percentage rate of glacier loss during this early period substantially exceeded the percentage rate of loss observed in the 21st century .\nI suspect that much of this melting occurred in the 1930 \u2019 s ( see next section ) .\nLooking much further back , Glacier National Park was virtually ice free 11,000 years ago .\nGlaciers have been present within the boundaries of present-day Glacier National Park since about 6,500 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have varied in size , tracking climatic variations , but did not grow to their recent maximum size until the end of the Little Ice Age , around 1850 .\nAn 80-year period ( ~1770-1840 ) of cool , wet summers and above-average winter snowfall led to a rapid growth of glaciers just prior to the end of the Little Ice Age .\nSo , the recent loss of glacier mass must be understood in light of the fact the glaciers reached their largest mass for the past 11,000 years during the 19th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasn \u2019 t updated its glacial survey since 2015 ( got ta wonder why , with the huge losses they were expecting ) .\nWhile the loss between 1998 and 2015 has decreased relative to prior decades , it appears that the ice loss has actually stalled or slightly reversed since 2008 [ link ] This stall caused the Glacier National Park in 2017 to start taking down the signs that expected the glaciers to disappear by 2020 .\nSo , what is going on ?\nThe areal extent and mass balance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulation during the cold season and the glacier melting during summer .\nThere is no prima facie reason that slow warming of the average annual surface temperatures will cause net loss of glacier area/mass .\nThere are strong interannual and multidecadal variations in the amount of snowfall , and in some situations warmer winter temperatures can be associated with more snowfall .\nThe summer melt season is quite short .\nThe timing of the quixotic , weather-driven seasonal transition from snow to rainfall is a key determinant of the onset of the melt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , the diurnal timing and overall amount of cloudiness can make a big difference in how much melting occurs .\nAnd finally , soot associated with air pollution can provide a substantial accelerant for glacier melting ; this is a huge issue for the Hindu-Kush-Himalayan glaciers , but I don \u2019 t see any reference to soot in context of Glacier National Park .\nYou will not be surprised to learn that ENSO , the Pacific Decadal Oscillation ( PDO ) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation ( AMO ) influence the atmospheric circulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow accumulation and summertime melt ( For an overview see LINK ) Lets first look at snow .\nFor the period of instrumental snow measurements in Montana since 1955 , there has been an overall declining trend in April snowpack in Montana during the period 1955-2015 .\nHowever , since 2016 , most of the last 7 years have shown normal to above normal spring snowpack across Montana .\n[ link ] This behavior reflects the variable nature of climate on both seasonal and decadal scales .\nTo extend understanding of past snowpack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to supplement the modern data pool .\nThese records include lake sediment and tree ring data .\nAn important study focused on the American West was published in 2011 , providing a data record over 500 years .\n[ LINK ] This length of record revealed climate variability on century scales including features like The Little Ice Age .\nThe study also demonstrated more short-term climatic features that show different anomalies between the northern and southern Rockies .\nOf particular relevance , the study identified a snow drought during the 1930s in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is similar to low values seen toward the end of the 20th century .\nNow consider summertime temperatures .\nShown here are Montana state averages from the NOAA State Climate Summary for Montana ( 2022 ) .\n[ link ] While the two decades in the 21st century have overall been the warmest for Montana since 1900 , there has been no trend in extreme summer temperatures .\nMontana \u2019 s warmest summer temperatures were in the 1930s .\nThe number of very hot days ( \u226595 oF ) and warm nights ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1930s .\nAny surprise here if glacial retreat was particularly strong in the 1930 \u2019 s ?\nThe \u201c greed \u201d part of Reilly Neill \u2019 s twitter rant seems to have something to do with fossil fuels .\nIf there is ever a place you might want to be kept warm by fossil fuels ( or nuclear ) , Montana during winter is it .\nMontana is one of the coldest states in the U.S. Of particular concern are wintertime \u201c Arctic outbreaks , \u201d which occur multiple times each winter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbreaks \u201d periodically bring exceptionally cold temperatures to large regions of the continental U.S. , even in this era of global warming .\nA little known JC biographical fact is that Arctic cold air outbreaks and the formation of cold-core anticyclones was the topic of my PhD thesis ) .\n[ link ] [ link ] An exceptionally cold outbreak occurred in Montana during February and March 2019 , with similar outbreaks in 2014 and 2017 .\nIn February 2019 , average temperature departures from normal in Montana were as much as 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Falls at the heart of the cold .\nTemperatures did not rise above 0 oF on 11 days and dropped to 0 oF or below on 24 nights .\nWhile the cold in February was remarkable for its persistence , the subsequent Arctic blast in early March 2019 delivered the coldest temperatures .\nAlmost two dozen official stations in Montana broke monthly records , with an all-time record state low temperature for March of -46F .\n[ link ] I can \u2019 t even imagine what it would be like to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such cold conditions .\nApart from freezing and figuring out how to keep warm , water pipes would be frozen ; not just a lack of potable water , but massive property damage once the pipes thaw .\nFortunately , Montana has a reliable power system with about 50 % renewables ( mostly hydro ) with most of the rest produced by coal .\nThere is a nontrivial contingent in Montana that is seeking 100 % renewable power ( hydro , wind , solar ) .\nIn addition to exceptional power demand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any power generation from renewables is at a minimum during such periods .\nMontana \u2019 s solar and hydropower capacity are at their lowest during winter .\nWhile winter winds are generally strong , the Arctic cold air outbreaks are accompanied by large regions of high pressure that are called cold-core anticyclones The nature of these circulations is that wind speeds are very low within the high pressure system , resulting in very low amounts of wind power production .\nWhile Arctic outbreaks generally impact the northern Great Plains states the worst , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very large .\nThe cold outbreak during February 2021 that impacted Montana also covered half of the U.S. and extended down to Texas , where massive power outages ensued that resulted in considerable loss of life .\nThe large horizontal scale of these high pressure systems indicates that remote transmission of excess energy from someplace else is not going to be of much help if much of the continent is also suffering from cold temperatures and low winds .\nThe long duration of these events makes battery storage hugely infeasible .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNothing is simple when it comes to understanding the causes of climate change impacts .\nThe key to understanding is to look at the longest data records available , and try to interpret the causes of the historical and paleo variability .\nOnce you understand the natural variability , you aren \u2019 t so prone to attributing everything to fossil-fueled warming and making na\u00efve predictions of the future .\nAnd once you understand weather variability and extremes , you won \u2019 t be so enthusiastic about renewable energy .\nI hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real scientists of Montana understand the causes of the recent variations in Montana \u2019 s glaciers .", "author":

exchange currently in bankruptcy , appears to share some similarities with factors which led to the demise of Enron .\nEnron and FTX both initially achieved success because they were able to exploit some of the inefficiencies present in a complex system .\nWhile it is a great thing to identify and correct inefficiency , the abilities of those who do so may be greatly overestimated at times .\nAs with Enron , it may have taken a special brilliance for Sam Bankman-Fried to capitalize on some shortcomings in crypto markets .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the many speaking engagements and the adoring press commensurate with accomplishments and abilities ?\nYou don \u2019 t have to be an overall expert in regards to a complex system in order to discover and tinker with particular inefficiencies and shortcomings within that system .\nIn fact , successful exploiters may be grossly ignorant or worse , misinformed about major factors of the complex system .\nThe ability to exploit a system does not mean that the exploiter is capable of redesigning the system , building a system ground up or even maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial success and ultimate failure of Enron \u2019 s attempt to transform the energy market before concluding with some thoughts around exploiters and experts .\nIn the period prior to the emergence of Enron and other power marketers , utilities operated in a more isolated fashion when developing , operating and scheduling their power supply .\nWhile there were power sales between utilities which might be triggered by supply and demand imbalances , the concept of short-term sales of energy based on incremental cost differentials was not even on the radar of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in to make the system more stable and enable long term sales allowed for such exchanges .\nHowever , the mindset of the industry was not there .\nA common thought was that any energy sales should at least capture incremental as well as the fixed costs of those resources .\nWhile economists and utility personnel today can easily see the flaw in such thinking , it was not the case in the 90s .\nI remember my Vice President in the 1990 \u2019 s saying , \u201c Why should I sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor for less than it costs me ?\n\u201d Now he clearly was an expert on the functioning and economics of the overall power system , but there was a blind spot there .\nIt often took a while and a lot of effort for the argument that \u201c we will best reduce costs when we use every opportunity , we have to make a nickel \u201d , made sense to such experts .\nWhile utilities were very good at economically dispatching their own resources , they were not yet good at working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs down .\nIt was common for situations to occur , for example , where one utility would be ramping up a plant with incremental costs of 40 mills/kwh while their neighbor was ramping down a plant with incremental costs of 24 mills/kwh .\nWhile the individual systems were efficient on their own , greater efficiencies could be garnered the more their joint operation approximated working together much as a single system would .\nGreat savings can result when margins allow ramping down the more costly plants in an area while increasing generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were many challenges in getting multiple utilities to work together .\nBut working together had the potential to provide great benefits to all parties .\nEnron and other power marketers swept into this environment .\nBolstered by better communication technology , good transmission capability and Federal Regulations encouraging efficiency , marketers were able to put together and market deals to richly benefit buyers , sellers and themselves .\n( For information on Enron lobbying efforts that opened the system to marketers see this . )\nInitially the marketers provided a great service .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which might not have occurred in their absence .\nCheaper surplus energy replaced more costly energy .\nThey found buyers for temporary and limited capacity surpluses allowing some to defray excess costs and others to reap savings from delaying capacity additions .\nThere were win-win-win situations for buyers , sellers and marketers .\nThe industry underwent a lot of change quickly and at this time many thought that Enron and their ilk were the \u201c smartest guys in the room \u201d .\nBut as it turned out the positive change and impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited .\nTheir knowledge base lacked breadth and depth .\nAs I mentioned earlier , my VP was an expert on power systems despite having a temporary blind spot when it came to recognizing the benefits of potential sales and purchases , and we were slow to act .\nThe power marketers were great at exploiting such shortcomings in the system , but they were not power system experts .\nBecause of their contributions , some gave them credit and deference far beyond what was deserved .\nThey were in an enviable position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were big and growing , but the situation they were exploiting would not provide for continued unchecked growth .\nCompetitors flooded the markets and utilities gained expertise and confidence in doing such transactions on their own such that potential opportunities to reduce cost differences became scarcer .\nWhile many of the power marketers had big goals , they were exploiters not experts and their knowledge and capabilities would not be sufficient to maintain their existing market shares let alone allow for their desired growth .\nFinancial markets drove great efficiencies in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to a point of diminishing returns .\nHow did many power marketers respond in this situation given their financial pressures ?\nOften power marketers created deals that were increasingly complex and risky .\nEventually many ended up making deals that flew in the face of basic goals and principles of power supply .\nSome approaches at times crossed over into ethically questionable and occasionally outright morally wrong illegal practices .\nAn example of an unsound practice concerns the supply of dependable generation capacity for emergency situations such as during unplanned major unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations utilities often relied on older plants which were no longer able to run economically .\nThey received costly maintenance just so that they could be ready to supply power in emergency situations .\nWhile originally each utility had extra units on hand to provide firm dependable power ( usually at a great cost ) marketers brought about great benefits through instruments that allowed the sharing of excess capacity , so everyone didn \u2019 t need their own exclusive backup units .\nInitially when contracting for such emergency power there was a physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available to provide power when needed .\nWho had priority for each resource under what conditions was well understood by all participants .\nThose with top priority had \u201c firm power \u201d based on a physical resource on the ground and they could point to it and know when it should be expected to help them out under what conditions .\nEventually , power marketers went beyond that and developed an instrument called \u201c financially firm power \u201d .\nWhat that meant was that although they did not have an identified resource on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d firm power when needed by the purchaser through their willingness to go into the market and buy energy at whatever price it took .\nThey projected that they would save so much money by not providing actual firm capacity that they could afford to buy it on the spot market in the rare event that they ever needed to actually provide it in an emergency .\nWhile many in the industry were suspicious of such products , overall , the industry bought in to it .\nIn some cases , power supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others they were over-ruled by accountants , rate makers and others who prioritized the benefits from lower costs .\nSome entities held the line and insisted on products that they could ensure were connected to identifiable physical resources .\nThe short-term financial situation was better for those who trusted the marketers .\nOne reason such instruments could work was because the system was built to be extremely reliable and although these contracts tended to reduce reliability , the system was robust enough it was not observable .\nWhile it seemed apparent to many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system was becoming inherently less robust .\n( For a discussion concerning why it \u2019 s difficult to observe erosions in grid reliability see this . )\nFederal regulations intended to support competitiveness and open access pushed utilities towards more outsourcing of supply side resources .\nFERC did not like transmission owners allowing their affiliated generators to have a monopoly on power supply or even to get a slight advantage when selecting power supply options .\nSo , marketers would develop power sales contracts which utilities had to compare against self-supply options .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were \u201c best \u201d in the regulators \u2019 eyes .\nIn addition to products like \u201c financially firm power \u201d , utilities entered long term purchase contracts which may or may not be tied to specific plants , where they hoped anticipated market changes would benefit them down the road .\nThe utility self-generation options were based on in-ground projects that did not allow such leeway to become more competitive ( but maybe ultimately more costly ) .\nUnlike previous planned resources which a utility could control and see , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interactions of many other industry players .\nThings were fine for a while .\nEventually the competitiveness of the market and diminishing returns made it harder and harder for marketers to make money as they had in the past .\nSome took shortcuts and employed questionable and unethical practices .\nWhile costs were going down , these new arrangements left the power systems without as much redundancy , robustness or resilience as they had had in the past .\nPreviously , although there were not formalized sharing agreements in place , utilities would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their excess in times of emergency .\nBut in an efficient market such excess capabilities are increasingly rare and in theory should disappear .\nAt times when emergencies happened , there were not enough resources on the ground to supply the load irrespective of the complex financial arrangements intended to support the system .\nWhen multiple parties are committed to provide \u201c financially firm \u201d power and there are insufficient supply sources available , the market price tends to infinity .\nThis causes default or bankruptcy .\nWhen market conditions do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long term power supply arrangements can force the supplier to default or go bankrupt .\nWhen resources are not available the purchasers of such instruments see little relief from their bankruptcy .\nUtilities acting on their own had a lot of skin in the game .\nAt the end of the day , they were responsible for keeping the lights on .\nFrom my experience they all took this very seriously .\nMarketers providing efficiency took away a lot of control the individual utilities had in the past .\nBad practices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market conditions all but guarantee failure .\nCreative/illegal practices may forestall but will not pre-empt the inevitable crash .\nExtreme conditions happened , markets did not perform as forecasted , and many marketers went out of business either from the financial or legal impacts of their poor decisions .\nWhile it looked like many utilities were saving money along the way , the cost of the failures imposed a crushing financial burden for many .\nIn California , market prices resulted in utilities seeing incredible price spikes and blackouts .\nThese were blamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market manipulations and gaming of the system , such problems could emerge without \u201c evil \u201d market participants .\nThe large investor-owned utilities ( IOUs ) were heavily into the market approach .\nHowever , the large municipal entity , the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power ( LADWP ) , perhaps because they were not pressured by regulatory authorities , followed a more traditional planning approach during this period .\nAt the time , I saw the difference as providing a \u201c control \u201d group for the marketing approach .\nDuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey had sufficient energy to serve their needs and made a killing with sales into the market while helping their neighbors mitigate its impacts .\nI \u2019 ve talked to regulators from California since and read many media accounts , but I don \u2019 t know that others have seen the dots as I did , let alone connected them in the same way .\nOverwhelmingly it seems the consensus is that market manipulation rather than market failures caused the problems .\nA full examination of the evidence should lead to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad situation of an already vulnerable system .\nIt seems prudent to ask if market failures and emerging potential disasters \u201c caused \u201d the market manipulations rather than resulting from them .\nWe might be best served by assuming that this type behavior is inherent and largely unavoidable in failing markets .\nSuch reasoning is not widespread , unfortunately .\nWhen the market is responsible for meeting emergency loads , no individual entities have skin in the game .\nThere is a loss here that needs to be reckoned with .\nWorldwide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to see problems .\nHowever , conventional planning approaches , particularly those with lesser commitments to intermittent resources , continue to do well .\nWhile it \u2019 s possible to be both an expert and an exploiter , one should be wary of exploiters claiming broad expertise .\nInitially , exploiting inefficiencies in a system is a good thing .\nHowever , exploitation can get out of control and the recipe for failure seen by Enron could apply around innovation in many complex systems : \u2022 Exploiter spots an inefficiency/improvement and use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system .\n\u2022 Initial success leads to greater success , particularly during good times , and that party

leads the exploiters to plan for and expect continued growth and expansion .\n\u2022 Success , money and influence impact policy makers to be overly optimistic such that they make the system more open

questionable decision making .\n\u2022 The realities of the system come crashing down in times of market stress .\nIt will be interesting to watch this as more is known about FTX to see if their trajectory followed a similar path .\nExploitation and Innovation in the Energy Arena In the energy arena the limits of exploitation can be seen on smaller scales as well .\nThe first to capitalize on innovations reap benefits but opportunities often close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFor example , in many circumstances it may be possible to make money by displacing generation which has high variable costs with cheaper intermittent energy .\nWind generation and solar applications can be successful .\nBut as more participants enter that space you quickly see diminishing returns .\nSystems can only accommodate a limited level of displacement from intermittent resources .\nFurthermore , what worked on a small scale likely will not work when scaled up .\n( See this posting as to why the continual expansion of intermittent generating resources is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to wind and solar , we are not as a society recognizing that we are attempting to use these resources at levels far beyond their potential .\nWe have seen some who have made money with intermittent resources seeking to expand their operations , claiming expertise and arguing that the system can absorb their expansion and seeking to impact policy makers and regulators to aid with their expansion .\nBut they are not overall system experts and unfortunately their plans can not work .\nIt \u2019 s one thing to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot more ability to put it back together again .\nTaking apart a system , changing the parts and asking others to put it back together doesn \u2019 t take a lot of ability , but the ask is near impossible .\nEnergy \u201c plans \u201d that call for wholesale changes but do not consider how the final overall system might work are not plans but rather only na\u00efve wish lists .\n\u201c Experts \u201d , be they exploiters , innovators or highly specialized geniuses who call for sweeping change without a broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high degree of skepticism .\nIf the plans don \u2019 t account for system needs , but rather rely on innovation down the road , the skepticism should be increased further .\nElon Musk has spoken of revolutionizing our energy system , but that is just talk .\nI appreciate the genius of Elon Musk and he has done an incredible job in developing and manufacturing electric vehicles .\nHe has a strong expertise and presence in the battery market .\nKudos for his efforts in rooftop solar even though he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early projections there .\nHe may yet help reshape the grid but there is a lot of work that needs to be done before anyone can outline how

types of expertise , but serious respect must be given to proven experience .\nWhere do policy makers look for expertise ?\nThere is risk in looking solely toward the utility industry .\nAs discussed , industry insiders can be to set in their ways and fail to see the benefits that exploiters can realize by eliminating inefficiencies .\nIt \u2019 s possible also that industry insiders might be overly skeptical of newer technologies brought about by innovators .\nOn the other hand , ignoring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger as innovator and exploiters likely do not have a great understanding of the broader system .\nPolicy makers should seek broad input from many segments .\nBut care should be taken when evaluating their input .\nThe initial successful track record of Enron and other Power Marketers was not sufficient for entrusting them to transform the energy industry as policy makers did .\nHowever , we still see areas of the country that have overly optimistic hopes for the capabilities of markets to provide capacity and energy ( See this posting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versus Financial Expertise Perhaps the biggest problem plaguing Enron ( and likely FTX ) is that they were too far removed from producing anything of direct value : energy , food , physical resources\u2026 .\nI certainly believe in markets but they don \u2019 t work everywhere .\nProviding value through

and overconfidence in global climate models", "content": "This post lays out in fairly complete detail some basic facts about Computational Fluid Dynamics ( CFD ) modeling .\nThis technology is the core of all general circulation models of the atmosphere and oceans , and hence global climate models ( GCMs ) .\nI discuss some common misconceptions about these models , which lead to overconfidence in these simulations .\nThis situation is related to the replication crisis in science generally , whereby much of the literature is affected by selection and positive results bias .\nA full-length version of this article can be found at [ lawsofphysics1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also this publication [ onera ] Numerical simulation over the last 60 years has come to play a larger and larger role in engineering design and scientific investigations .\nThe level of detail and physical modeling varies greatly , as do the accuracy requirements .\nFor aerodynamic simulations , accurate drag increments between configurations have high value .\nIn climate simulations , a widely used target variable is temperature anomaly .\nBoth drag increments and temperature anomalies are particularly difficult to compute accurately .\nThe reason is simple : both output quantities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall absolute levels of momentum for drag or energy for temperature anomalies .\nThis means that without tremendous effort , the output quantity is smaller than the numerical truncation error .\nGreat care can sometimes provide accurate results , but careful numerical control over all aspects of complex simulations is required .\nContrast this with some fields of science where only general understanding is sought .\nIn this case qualitatively interesting results can be easier to provide .\nThis is known in the parlance of the field as \u201c Colorful Fluid Dynamics.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simulations do have their place .\nIt can not be stressed too strongly however that even the broad \u201c patterns \u201d can be quite wrong .\nOnly after extensive validation can such simulations be trusted qualitatively , and even then only for the class of problems used in the validation .\nSuch a validation process for one aeronautical CFD code consumed perhaps 50-100 man years of effort in a setting where high quality data was generally available .\nWhat is all too common among non-specialists is to conflate the two usage regimes ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assumption that realistic looking results imply quantitatively meaningful results .\nThe first point is that some fields of numerical simulation are very well founded on rigorous mathematical theory .\nTwo that come to mind are electromagnetic scattering and linear structural dynamics .\nElectromagnetic scattering is governed by Maxwell \u2019 s equations which are linear .\nThe theory is well understood , and very good numerical simulations are available .\nGenerally , it is possible to develop accurate methods that provide high quality quantitative results .\nStructural modeling in the linear elasticity range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial di\ufb00erential equations .\nThe Earth system with its atmosphere and oceans is much more complex than most engineering simulations and thus the models are far more complex .\nHowever , the heart of any General Circulation Model ( GCM ) is a \u201c dynamic core \u201d that embodies the Navier-Stokes equations .\nPrimarily , the added complexity is manifested in many subgrid models of high complexity .\nHowever , at some fundamental level a GCM is computational fluid dynamics .\nIn fact GCM \u2019 s were among the first efforts to solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were solved by the pioneers in the field , such as the removal of sound waves .\nThere is a positive feature of this history in that the methods and codes tend to be optimized quite well within the universe of methods and computers currently used .\nThe downside is that there can be a very high cost to building a new code or inserting a new method into an existing code .\nIn any such effort , even real improvements will at first appear to be inferior to the existing technology .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the penetration of more modern methods into the codes .\nThe best technical argument I have heard in defense of GCM \u2019 s is that Rossby waves are vastly easier to model than aeronautical flows where the pressure gradients and forcing can be a lot higher .\nThere is some truth in this argument .\nThe large-scale vortex evolution in the atmosphere on shorter time scales is relatively unaffected by turbulence and viscous effects , even though at finer scales the problem is ill-posed .\nHowever , there are many other at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system .\nAn important one is tropical convection , a classical ill-posed problem because of the-large scale turbulent interfaces and shear layers .\nWhile usually neglected in aeronautical calculations , free air turbulence is in many cases very large in the atmosphere .\nHowever , it is typically neglected outside the boundary layer in GCMs .\nAnd of course there are clouds , convection and precipitation , which have a very significant effect on overall energy balance .\nOne must also bear in mind that aeronautical vehicles are designed to be stable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that pathological nonlinear behaviors are avoided .\nIn this sense aeronautical models may be actually easier to model than the atmosphere .\nIn any case aeronautical simulations are greatly simplified by a number of assumptions , for example that the onset flow is steady and essentially free of atmospheric turbulence .\nAeronautical flows can often be assumed to be essentially isentropic outside the boundary layer .\nAs will be argued below , the CFD literature is affected by positive results and selection bias .\nIn the last 20 years , there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strong influence that biased work can have on the scientific literature .\nIt is perhaps best documented in the medical literature where the scientific communities are very large and diverse .\nThese biases must be acknowledged by the community before they can be addressed .\nOf course , there are strong structural problems in modern science that make this a difficult thing to achieve .\nFluid Dynamics is a much more difficult problem than electromagnetic scattering or linear structures .\nFirst many of the problems are ill posed or nearly so .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonlinear systems , there are also often multiple solutions .\nEven in steady RANS ( Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes ) simulations there can be sensitivity to initial conditions or numerical details or gridding .\nThe AIAA Drag Prediction Workshop Series has shown the high levels of variability in CFD simulations even in attached mildly transonic and subsonic flows .\nThese problems are far more common than reported in the literature .\nAnother problem associated with nonlinearity in the equations is turbulence , basically defined as small scale fluctuations that have random statistical properties .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbulence is completely represented by accurate solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations , even though most experts believe that it is .\nBut the most critical difficulty is the fact that in most real life applications the Reynolds number is high or very high .\nThe Reynolds number represents roughly the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces .\nOne might think if the viscous forcing was 4 to 7 orders of magnitude smaller than the inertial forcing ( as it is for example in many aircraft and atmospheric simulations ) , it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the truth .\nThe inclusion of these viscous forces often results in an O ( 1 ) change in even total forces .\nCertainly , the effect on smaller quantities like drag is large and critical to successful simulations in most situations .\nThus , most CFD simulations are inherently numerically difficult and simplifications and approximations are required .\nThere is a vast literature on these subjects going back to the introduction of the digital computer ; John Von Neumann made some of the first forays into understanding the behaviour of discrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for modeling fluid flows by resolving all the relevant scales grow as Reynolds number to the power 9/4 in the general case , assuming second order numerical discretizations .\nComputational effort grows at least linearly with discrete problem size multiplied by the number of time steps .\nTime steps must also decrease as the spatial grid is refined because of the stability requirements of the Courant-Freidrichs-Levy condition as well as to control time discretization errors .\nThe number of time steps grows as Reynolds number to the power 3/4 .\nThus overall computational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power 3 .\nThus , for almost all problems of practical interest , it is computationally impossible ( and will be for the forseeable future ) to resolve all the important scales of the flow and so one must resort to subgrid models of fluctuations not resolved by the grid .\nFor many idealized engineering problems , turbulence is the primary effect that must be so modeled .\nIn GCMs there are many more , such as clouds .\nReferences are given in the full paper for some other views that may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to give people a feel for the range of opinion in the field .\nFor modeling the atmosphere , the difficulties are immense .\nThe Reynolds numbers are high and the turbulence levels are large but highly variable .\nMany of the supposedly small effects must be neglected based on scientific judgment .\nThere are also large energy flows and evaporation and precipitation and clouds , which are all ignored in virtually all aerodynamic simulations for example .\nOcean models require different methods as they are essentially incompressible .\nThis in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but adds mathematical difficulties .\n2.1 The Role of Numerical Errors in CFD Generally , the results of many steady state aeronautical CFD simulations are reproducible and reliable for thin boundary and shear layer dominated flows by assuming little flow separation and subsonic flow .\nThere are now a few codes that are capable of demonstrating grid convergence for the simpler geometries or lower Reynolds numbers .\nHowever , many of these simulations make many simplifying assumptions and uncertainty is much larger for separated or transonic flows .\nThe contrast with climate models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in climate models are often exceed 100 km and their vertical grid resolution is almost certainly inadequate .\nFurther many of the models use spectral methods that are not fully stable .\nVarious forms of filtering are used to remove undesirable oscillations .\nFurther , the many subgrid models are solved sequentially , adding another source of numerical errors and making tuning problematic .\n2.2 The Role of Turbulence and Chaos in Fluid Mechanics In this section I describe some well verified science from fluid mechanics that govern all Navier-Stokes simulations and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or climate models .\nOne of the problems in climate science is lack of fundamental understanding of these basic conclusions of fluid mechanics or ( as perhaps the case may be for some ) a reluctance to discuss the consequences of this science .\nTurbulence models have advanced tremendously in the last 50 years and climate models do not use the latest of these models , so far as I can tell .\nFurther , for large-scale vortical 3D flow , turbulence models are quite inadequate .\nNonetheless , proper modeling of turbulence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieving reasonable accuracy .\nJust to give one fundamental problem that is a showstopper at the moment : how to control numerical error in any time accurate eddy resolving simulation .\nClassical methods fail .\nHow can one tune such a model ?\nYou can tune it for a given grid and initial condition , but that tuning might fail on a finer grid or with different initial conditions .\nThis problem is just now beginning to be explored and is of critical importance for predicting climate or any other chaotic flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they are in most practical fluid dynamics simulations particularly climate simulations ) , there is a constant danger of \u201c overtuning \u201d subgrid models , discretization parameters or the hundreds of other parameters .\nThe problem here is that tuning a simulation for a few particular cases too accurately is really just getting large errors to cancel for these cases .\nThus skill will actually be worse for cases outside the tuning set .\nIn climate models the truncation errors are particularly large and computation costs too high to permit systematic study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThus tuning is problematic .\nAll turbulent flows are time dependent and there is no true steady state .\nHowever , using Reynolds averaging , one can separate the flow field into a steady component and a hopefully small component consisting of the unsteady fluctuations .\nThe unsteady component can then be modeled in various ways .\nThe larger the truly unsteady component is , the more challenging the modeling problem becomes .\nOne might be tempted to always treat the problem as a time dependent problem .\nThis has several challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( but not always in practice ) one should be able to use conventional numerical consistency checks in the steady state case .\nFor example , one can check grid convergence , calculate sensitivities for parameters cheaply using linearizations , and use the residual as a measure of reliability .\nFor the Navier-Stokes equations , there is no rigorous proof that the infinite grid limit exists or is unique .\nIn fact , there is strong evidence for multiple solutions , some corresponding to states seen in testing , and others not .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ time accurate simulations or are much more difficult to assess .\nTime accurate simulations are also challenging because the numerical errors are in some sense cumulative , i.e.\n, an error at a given time step will be propagated to all subsequent time steps .\nGenerally , some kind of stability of the underlying continuous problem is required to achieve convergence .\nLikewise a stable numerical scheme is helpful .\nFor any chaotic time accurate simulation , classical methods of numerical error control fail .\nBecause the initial value problem is ill-posed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly daunting problem .\nWe know numerical errors are cumulative and can grow nonlinearly , but our usual methods are completely inapplicable .\nFor chaotic systems , the main argument that I have heard for time accurate simulations being meaningful is \u201c at least there is an attractor.\n\u201d The thinking is that if the attractor is sufficiently attractive , then errors in the solution will die off or at least remain bounded and not materially affect the time average solution or even the \u201c climate \u201d of the solution .\nThe solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inaccurate in detail as Lorenz discovered , but the climate will ( according to this argument ) be correct .\nAt least this is an argument that can be developed and eventually quantified and proven or disproven .\nPaul Williams has a nice example of the large effect of the time step on the climate of the Lorentz system .\nEvidence is emerging of a similar effect due to spatial grid resolution for time accurate Large Eddy Simulations and a disturbing lack of grid convergence .\nFurther , the attractor may be only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points and saddle points as well .\nAnd , the attractor can be of very high dimension , meaning that tracing out all its parts could be computationally a monumental if not impossible task .\nSo far , the bounds on attractor dimension are very large .\nMy suggestion would be to develop and fund a large long term research effort in this area with the best minds in the field of nonlinear theory .\nTheoretical understanding may not be adequate at the present time to address it computationally .\nThere is some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadowing that may eventually be computationally feasible that could address some of the stability issues for the long-term climate of the attractor .\nFor the special case of periodic or nearly periodic flows , another approach that is more computationally tractable is windowing .\nThis problem of time accurate simulations of chaotic systems seems to me to be a very important unsolved question in fundamental science and mathematics and one with tremendous potential impact across many fields .\nWhile climate modelers Palmer and Stevens \u2019 2019 short perspective note ( see full paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribution by two unusually honest scientists , there is in my opinion reason for skepticism about their proposal to make climate models into eddy resolving simulations .\nTheir assessment of climate models is in my view mostly correct and agrees with the thrust of this post , but there are a host of theoretical issues to be resolved before casting our lot with largely unexplored simulation methods that face serious theoretical challenges .\nDramatic increases in resolution are obviously sorely needed in climate models and dramatic improvements may be possible in subgrid models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example , modern PDE based models may make a significant difference .\nI don \u2019 t think anyone knows the outcomes of these various steps toward improvement .\nThe \u201c laws of physics \u201d are usually thought of as conservation laws , the most important being conservation of mass , momentum , and energy .\nThe conservation laws with appropriate source terms for fluids are the Navier- Stokes equations .\nThese equations correctly represent the local conservation laws and offer the possibility of numerical simulations .\nThis is expanded on in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Boundary Value Problem ?\nOne often hears that \u201c the climate of the attractor is a boundary value problem \u201d and therefore it is predictable .\nThis is nothing but an assertion with little to back it up .\nAnd of course , even assuming that the attractor is regular enough to be predictable , there is the separate question of whether it is computable with finite computing time .\nIt is similar to the folk doctrine that turbulence models convert an ill-posed time dependent problem into a well posed steady state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be wrong \u2013 as the prevalence of multiple solutions discussed above shows .\nHowever , those who are engaged in selling CFD have found it attractive despite its unscientific and effectively unverifiable nature .\nA simple analogy for the climate system might be a wing as Nick Stokes has suggested .\nAs pointed out above , the drag for a well-designed wing is in some ways a good analogy for the temperature anomaly of the climate system .\nThe climate may respond linearly to changes in forcings over a narrow range .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ be useful , one must know the rate of response and the value ( the value of temperature is important for example for ice sheet response ) .\nThese are strongly dependent on details of the dynamics of the climate system through nonlinear feedbacks .\nMany use this analogy to try to transfer the credibility [ not fully deserved ] from CFD simulations of simple systems to climate models or other complex separated flow simulations .\nThis is not a correct implication .\nIn any case , even simple aeronautical simulations can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenging flows .\nSubgrid turbulence models have advanced tremendously over the last 50 years .\nThe subgrid models must modify the Navier-Stokes equations if they are to have the needed effect .\nTurbulence models typically modify the true fluid viscosity by dramatically increasing it in certain parts of the flow , e.g.\n, a boundary layer .\nThe problem here is that these changes are not really based on the \u201c laws of physics \u201d , and certainly not on the conservation laws .\nThe models are typically based on assumed relationships that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data or by simply fitting available test data .\nThey tend to be very highly nonlinear and typically make an O ( 1 ) difference in the total forces .\nAs one might guess , this area is one where controversy is rife .\nMost would characterize this as a very challenging problem , in fact one that will probably never be completely solved , so further research and controversy is a good thing .\nNegative results about subgrid models have begun to appear .\nOne recent paper shows that cloud microphysics models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by data .\nUsing plausible values , ECS ( equilibrium climate sensitivity ) can be \u201c engineered \u201d over a significant range .\nAnother interesting result shows that model results can depend strongly on the order chosen to solve the numerous subgrid models in a given cell .\nIn fact , the subgrid models should be solved simultaneously so that any tuning is more independent of numerical details of the methods used .\nThis is a fundamental principle of using such models and is the only way to ensure that tuning is meaningful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are poorly replicated by current generation climate models , particularly regional precipitation changes , cloud fraction as a function of latitude , Total Lower Troposphere temperature changes compared to radiosondes and satellite derived values , tropical convection aggregation and Sea Surface Temperature changes , just to name a few .\nThis lack of skill for SST changes seems to be a reason why GCM model-derived ECS is inconsistent with observationally constrained energy balance methods .\nGiven the large grid spacings used in climate models , this is not surprising .\nTruncation errors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy flows that are being modeled .\nIn this situation , skill is to be expected only on those metrics involved in tuning ( either conscious or subconscious ) or metrics closely associated with them .\nIn layman \u2019 s terms , those metrics used in tuning come into alignment with the data only because of cancellation of errors .\nOne can make a plausible argument for why models do a reasonable job of replicating the global average surface temperature anomaly .\nThe models are mostly tuned to match top of atmosphere radiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also consistent with reality ( and it seems to be pretty close ) and if the models conserve energy , one would expect the average temperature to be roughly right even if it is not explicitly used for tuning .\nHowever , this apparent skill does not mean that other outputs will also be skillful .\nThis problem of inadequate tuning and unconscious bias plagues all application areas of CFD .\nA typical situation involves a decades long campaign of attempts to apply a customer \u2019 s favorite code to an application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nOver the course of this campaign many , many combinations of gridding and other parameters are \u201c tried \u201d until an acceptable result is achieved .\nThe more challenging issue of establishing the limitations of this acceptable \u201c accuracy \u201d for different types of flows is often neglected because of lack of resources .\nThus , the cancellation of large numerical errors is never quantified and remains hidden , waiting to emerge when a more challenging problem is attempted .\nAs time passes , the seriousness of the bias issue in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood .\nOne recent example quotes one researcher as saying \u201c Loose scientific methods are leading to a massive false positive bias in the literature.\n\u201d Another study states : \u201c Poor research design and data analysis encourage false-positive findings .\nSuch poormethods persist despite perennial calls for improvement , suggesting that they result from something more than just misunderstanding .\nThe persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favour them , leading to the natural selection of bad science.\n\u201d In less scholarly settings , these results are typically met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are told that \u201c the fundamentals are secure \u201d or \u201c my field is different \u201d or \u201c this affects only the medical fields.\n\u201d To those in the field , however , it is obvious that strong positive bias affects the Computational Fluid Dynamics literature for the reasons described above and that practitioners are often overconfident .\nThis overconfidence in the codes and methods suits the perceived self-interest of those applying the codes ( and for a while suited the interests of the code developers and researchers ) , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the models to ever more challenging problems .\nRecently , this confluence of interests has been altered by an unforeseen consequence , namely laymen who determine funding have come to believe that CFD is a solved problem and hence have dramatically reduced the funding stream for fundamental development of new methods and also for new theoretical research .\nThis conclusion is an easy one for outsiders to reach given the CFD literature , where positive results predominate even though we know the models are just wrong both locally and globally for large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated flows .\nUnfortunately , this problem of bias is not limited to CFD , but I believe is common in many other fields that use CFD modeling as well .\nAnother rationalization used to justify confidence in models are appeals to the \u201c laws of physics \u201d as discussed above .\nThese appeals however omit a very important source of uncertainty and seem to provide a patina of certainty covering a far more complex reality .\nAnother corollary of the doctrine of the \u201c laws of physics \u201d is the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThus , simple models that ignore some feedbacks or terms in the equations are often maligned .\nThis doctrine also suits the interest of some in the community , i.e.\n, those working on more complex and costly simulations .\nIt is also a favored tactic of Colorful Fluid Dynamics to portray the ultimately accurate simulation as just around the corner if we get all the \u201c physics \u201d included and use a sufficiently massive parallel computer .\nThis view is not an obvious one when critically examined .\nIt is widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and use CFD results and those who fund CFD .\nSo what is the future of such simulations and GCMs ?\nAs attempts are made to use them in areas where public health and safety are at stake , estimating uncertainty will become increasingly important .\nItems deserving attention in my opinion are discussed in some detail in the full paper , posted here on Climate Etc .\nI would argue that the most important elements needing attention , both in CFD and in climate and weather modeling , are new theoretical work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate data .\nThe latter work is not glamorous and the former can entail career risks .\nThese are hard problems .\nand in many cases , a particular line of enquiry will not yield anything really new .\nThe dangers to be combatted include : \u2022 It is critical to realize that the literature is biased and that replication failures are often not published .\n\u2022 None We really need to escape from the elliptic boundary value problem ( well posed ) mental model that are held by so many with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variant of this mental model one encounters in the climate world is the doctrine of \u201c converting an initial value problem to a boundary value problem.\n\u201d This just confuses the issue , which is really about the attractor and its properties .\nThe methods developed for well-posed elliptic problems have been pursued about as far as they will take us .\nHowever , this mental model can result in dramatic overconfidence in models in CFD .\n\u2022 A corollary of the \u201c boundary value problem \u201d misnomer is the idea that \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer will be right \u201d mental model .\nThis is patently false and even dangerous , however , it gratifies egos and aids in marketing .\nI have tried to lay out in summary form some of the issues with high Reynolds number fluid simulations and to highlight the problem of overconfidence as well as some avenues to try to fundamentally advance our understanding .\nLaymen need to be aware of the typical tactics of the dark arts of \u201c Colorful Fluid Dynamics \u201d and \u201c science communication.\n\u201d It is critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is affected by selection and positive results bias .\nThis is something that most will admit privately , but is almost never publicly discussed .\nHow does this bias come about ?\nAn all too common scenario is for a researcher to have developed a new code or a new feature of an old code or to be trying to apply an existing code or method to a particular test case of interest to a customer .\nThe first step is to find some data that is publicly available or obtain customer supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well documented experiments involve flows that are not tremendously challenging .\nOne then runs the code or model ( adjusting grid strategies , discretization and solver methodologies , and turbulence model parameters or methods ) until the results match the data reasonably well .\nThen the work often stops ( in many cases because of lack of funding or lack of incentives to draw more scientifically balanced conclusions ) and is published .\nThe often large number of runs with different parameters that provided less convincing results are explained as due to \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuning , \u201d \u201c my inexperience in running the code , \u201d etc .\nThe supply of witches to be burned is seemingly endless .\nThese rationalizations are usually quite honest and sincerely believed , but biased .\nThey are based on a cultural bias that if the model is \u201c run right \u201d then the results will be right , if not quantitatively , then at least qualitatively .\nAs we saw above , those who develop the models themselves know this to be incorrect as do those responsible for using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs a last resort one can always point to any deficiencies in the data or for the more brazen , simply claim the data is wrong since it disagrees with the simulation .\nThe far more interesting and valuable questions about robustness and uncertainty or even structural instability in the results are often neglected .\nOne logical conclusion to be drawn from the perspective by Palmer and Stevens calling for eddy resolving climate models is that the world of GCM \u2019 s is little better .\nHowever , this paper is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is to be strongly commended .\nThis may seem a cynical view , but it is unfortunately based on practices in the pressure filled research

senior people in the field can suppress negative results .\nSome way needs to be found to provide incentives for honest and objective replication efforts and publishing those findings regardless of the opinions of the authors of the method .\nPriorities somehow need to be realigned toward more scientifically valuable information about robustness and stability of results and addressing

Response from observations 1979-2022", "content": "A very interesting blog post by Gavin Schmidt provides input on \u201c constraining \u201c the observed TCR ( Transient Climate Response ) in the time window 1979- 2022 using the latest climate models .\nGavin presents a comparison of the \u201c Models screened by their TCR \u201d against observations using the GISS surface temperature data : Fig.1 : Reproduction of the 1st figure in Gavin \u2019 s blog post .\nWhat does Gavin mean by \u201c Models screened by TCR \u201c ?\nHe refers Tokarska et al ( 2020 ) .\nTokarska et al used all CMIP6 ( and CMIP5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regression against the observed warming .\nThis is not exactly the method Gavin used .\nFrom the chapter \u201c Constraints on the TCR \u201d of Tokarska ( 2020 ) : This also means that the warming trend for 1979 to 2022 is more correlated with the TCR than was found in Tokarska et al ( 2020 ) because the time window is longer : 44 vs. 37 years .\nThe trend slopes tell the story of the implied TCR .\n\u201c The observationally constrained TCR likely range ( 17 to 83 % ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1.20\u00b0 to 1.99\u00b0C with a median of 1.60\u00b0C \u201d The best estimate of TCR based on CMIP6 models ( the red line in Fig.1 ) is 1.6K / 2*CO2 , following the cited paper .\nUsing the preliminary GMST data from GISS for January \u2013 October 2022 , I reconstruct Fig.1 from Gavin \u2019 s post to estimate the warming trend slopes 1979-2022 : Fig .\n2 : The added GMST for 2022 and the OLS trend slopes for Observations and the \u201c TCR-constrained \u201c CMIP6 models , digitized from Fig.1 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trend slopes ( \u201c which are strongly correlated with TCR \u201c , as Tokarska et al stated ) have a difference , the observations ( GISS ) showing a 21 % lower trend slope than the TCR constrained CMIP6-models , which have a TCR of 1.6 as the best estimate .\nConsidering this fact , the observations point to a TCR of 1.6/1.21= 1.3 K/doubling of CO2 as the best estimate .\nThe 17 to 83 % likely range from the regression is 1.22 to 1.38 .\nThese TCR values are very similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nThe TCR of 1.3 , confirmed by the latest data , gives a warming in 2100 of 1.75 vs. pre-industrial times , when considering the 4.5 W/m\u00b2 forcing scenario .\nWe would remain within the \u201c 2\u00b0C goal \u201c even with a forcing of 5W/m\u00b2 to 2100 , we would produce 1.9 K of warming .\nAll available serious literature excludes a catastrophic outcome of the global warming , if we remain within the 2K limit .\nIt seems very likely that we will do so .\nNo doom and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSomebody should inform the scared people who are doing such strange things in the name of \u201c The Science \u201c .\nScience tells it otherwise , giving much hope that mankind will avoid the \u201c catastrophic climate endgame \u201d .", "author": "curryja", "url":

the timing will be better to talk about my new book .\nIn recent weeks I have done two long-form interviews : Both are interesting and different from each other .\nI expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EISM interview ; post interview we both realized that we had missed the most relevant topic for our interaction \u2013 risk governance .\nIf you only have time to watch one , watch BizNews , where the interviewer gave me pretty free reign .\nThis interview went viral on youtube , with 500,000 views in 7 days .\nIntimations of trouble ahead were a \u201c Context \u201d statement on climate change from the UN attached to my interview , designed to tell people the \u201c truth \u201d about climate change ( when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth \u201d of UN climate politics ) .\nOn day 7 , when the video hit

) .\nHopefully that will get better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shingles .\nI have postherpetic trigeminal neuralgia ( bad nerve pain on the left side of my face that is focused on my nose ) , which has been going on since August ( lightweight plastic glasses are more comfortable ) .\nThe problem with some of these interviews is that they go on for 60+ minutes .\nNo one has that much time to listen , when they can read the text much faster ( which is why I rarely listen to podcasts myself ) .\nI guess multi-tasking ( listening while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) can work .\nI \u2019 m not a podcast listener myself ,

being sabotaged internally at twitter [ LINK ] Despite huge number of twitter employees fired by Musk , it seems like he didn \u2019 t fire enough .\nHere is Part II of the twitter files .\nApparently numerous further installments are forthcoming .\nUs tweeps are just riveted by all this .\np.s .\nthings are starting to break fast ; here is Part III on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is introducing chaos into twitter , but it badly needed shaking up .\nMusk \u2019 s strategy of break things , try new things , abandon them if they don \u2019 t work , and then repeat has made many advertising clients nervous .\nA number of celebrities and scientists have left twitter ; apparently the idea of Musk and free speech uncensored by left wingers does great \u201c violence \u201d to their souls .\nMany climate scientists have left , although ones with large # of twitter followers such as Mann and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving twitter have joined Mastodon , which is open source microblogging software , with individuals hosting topical microblogs .\nI took a look ; crazy complicated and heavily siloed .\nThe brilliant thing about twitter is that it is impossible to keep yourself totally siloed , no matter how many people you block .\nClose minded , groupthinking , whiny climate scientists are not doing themselves a favor by siloing themselves at Mastodon .\nBut the twitterverse doesn \u2019 t seem to be missing them ; I hope they are having fun talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastic supporter of what Musk is trying to do , and mostly I am very grateful to no longer be shadow banned by twitter .\nI look forward to the next installments of the twitter files , which will hopefully explain shadow banning among other things .\nTwitter is the indispensable tool for wicked scientists .\nThe Musk/twitter saga is raising important issues about free speech and censorship , particularly in context of social media .\nThis is not a simple issue .\nNo sane person wants to participate or advertise on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm , violent or pornographic images .\nBut where to you draw the line ?\nThis topic is worthy of its own thread ; it will be interesting to see how this evolves .\nI have been asked previously to write ( and have done so occasionally ) op-eds by WSJ , Financial Times , Fox News on specific topics .\nI haven \u2019 t been all that enthusiastic about doing these .\nThey are difficult to write , with stringent word limits , and not always on the topic that I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular time .\nInvariably the editor picks a different title , sometimes one that grates and doesn \u2019 t really reflect the actual article IMO .\nI \u2019 ve been asked by SkyNews in Australia to contribute an occasional ( once per month ) column/op-ed on climate and energy topics of relevance to Australia .\nThe environment in the US is so toxic and noisy on this topic , so writing outside the U.S. makes sense to me .\nTrust is a big issue for me , I feel comfortable working with SkyNews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500-600 words ; difficult for me since I \u2019 m a long-form writer .\nI am getting around this by writing a longer essay and then breaking it into parts that are individually coherent but part of a larger theme and longer series .\nThe style of writing is also a challenge , need to use words very economically with simple sentence structures ( this is good discipline for me anyways ) .\nMy first article was published this week , I should probably do separate threads on these articles .\nThe faux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us no time or space build a secure energy future Well lets see how all this goes .\nAt least right now , this is fun and interesting , and I have some small hope of making a difference .\nMore importantly I expect my 2023 to focus on

post is a follow on to my recent post Victims of the faux climate \u2018 crisis \u2019 .\nPart I : Children .\nThe issue of psychological trauma of children is one that I am continuing to work on , to identify root causes and a way forward .\nThe theme of this particular post is how our perceptions of risk differ from the actual risk itself .\nUnderstanding this difference provides insights to understanding these fears , as well as providing insights into how these differences are manipulated by propagandists .\nApart from the objective facts about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our interpretation of those facts is ultimately subjective .\nRisk science makes a clear distinction between professional judgments about risk versus the public perception of risk .\nRisk perception is a person \u2019 s subjective judgement or appraisal of risk , which can involve social , cultural and psychological factors .\nNo matter how strongly we feel about our perceptions of risk , we often get risk wrong .\nPeople worry about some things more than the evidence warrants ( e.g .\nnuclear radiation , genetically modified food ) , and less about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g.\n, obesity , using mobile phones while driving ) .\nThis gap in risk perception produces social policies that protect us more from what we are afraid of than from what actually threatens us the most .\nUnderstanding the psychology of risk perception is important for rationally managing the risks that arise when our subjective risk perception system gets things dangerously wrong .\n[ ii ] The Psychometric Paradigm research of psychologist Paul Slovic and collaborators describes a suite of psychological characteristics that make risks feel more or less frightening , relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ iv ] [ v ] In each of these pairs , the first risk type is generally preferred to the second risk type .\nFor example , risks that are common , self-controlled and voluntary , such as driving , generate the least public apprehension .\nRisks that are rare and imposed that lack potential upside , like terrorism , invoke the most dread .\n[ vi ] The risk of manmade climate change is one that people would not be aware of without scientific research .\nPeople experience a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasonal cycle and from year to year .\nPeople would not be aware of the scientific research on climate change if not for the UN having declared climate research to be policy relevant in context of the 1992 UNFCCC Treaty to prevent \u201c dangerous anthropogenic climate change.\n\u201d People don \u2019 t normally pay much attention to what is going at the UN ; this changed circa 2006/2007 with Al Gore \u2019 s Inconvenient Truths and the IPCC AR4 and the Nobel Peace Prize .\nPeople really weren \u2019 t caring so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm could a few degrees of warming actually cause ?\nWell , I was an inadvertent contributor to explaining the potential harm of 1 degree of warming , with the now famous Webster et al .\n2005 paper that identified a doubling in the proportion of Category 4/5 hurricanes since 1970 .\nFor the first time , the connection was made between a devastating hurricane such as Katrina and a small amount of warming .\nWhat was previously understood to be a vague risk ( # 6 ) in the future ( # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # 1 ) became a specific and horrifying risk in the here and now , that was caused by our fossil fuel emissions .\nClimate activists , the media and even scientists seized on the \u201c extreme weather event caused by climate change \u201d narrative as being the ideal vehicle for ramping up the alarm about human-caused global warming .\nIn addition to striking chords with # 1 , # 6 and # 8 , extreme weather events also play into # 7-uncommon risks , since these risks are uncommon for individual locations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprecedented in a specific location , they are sufficiently rare for people not to be prepared for them .\nEvery extreme weather event is now attributed to global warming , even extreme cold outbreaks and heavy snow .\nScientists who should know better just can \u2019 t resist the opportunities for media attention and enthusiastically place blame on human-caused global warming .\nIn spite of the fact that IPCC assessment reports find very little in the way of any contribution of human-caused global warming to extreme weather events .\nAs emphasized by John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first half of the 20th century , you will invariably find equivalent weather and climate extremes .\nAs emphasized by Andy Revkin , if you look back into paleoclimate record , you will find much worse weather and climate extremes .\nNo matter \u2013 never let the historical and paleoclimate data records get in the way of an alarming story that attributes the most recent disaster to fossil fuel emissions , and so amping up the pressure to eliminate fossil fuel emissions .\nExtreme weather events have become an increasingly important part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but kids didn \u2019 t start getting \u201c psychologically injured \u201d until the climate communicators and \u201c educators \u201d took this to the next higher level .\nThe timing of this started around 2017 , following the increasingly apocalyptic rhetoric from UN officials and national leaders in support of the Paris Agreement and the coincident formation of the Sunrise Movement , Extinction Rebellion , etc .\nI don \u2019 t find much in the published literature about psychological injuries to children from climate change prior to about 2018 ; this is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perception , this amplified narrative of alarm emphasizes that these \u201c climate change \u201d catastrophes are imposed on society by villainous fossil fuel companies ( # 4 ) , the risks are uncompensated ( i.e .\nthere have been no benefits to society from fossil fuels ) ( # 5 ) , and the risks are uncontrollable ( # 3 ) UNLESS politicians do the \u201c right thing , \u201d at the very least by virtue signaling with token knee capping of fossil fuel companies .\nAnd now for the final element of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks ( # 9 ) , whereby children and under-developed countries are at greatest risk .\nSerious virtue signaling tells us we need to eliminate fossil fuel emissions for the sake of the children and the underdeveloped countries .\nWell , children in affluent countries are at far less risk than their great-great grandparents ( not to mention children in underdeveloped countries ) owing to the presence of fossil fuels in their lives that provide secure structures for their homes and schools with central heating and air conditioning , not to mention abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food supply .\nPart II of my \u201c Victims \u201d series ( forthcoming ) is related to underdeveloped countries .\nThe proselytizers of apocalyptic climate change are exploiting both children and underdeveloped countries to urge action in eliminating fossil fuels .\nThe exploitation of children is outlined in Part I of my Victims series .\nThe short summary for Part II is that while affluent countries continue to exploit the fossil fuel resources of underdeveloped countries ( especially Africa ) , they are denying these countries the resources they need to actually use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their own economic development .\nInstead , international development and adaptation aid is being redirected towards green energy projects \u2013 mitigation of CO emissions that doesn \u2019 t provide adequate energy and places the countries further in debt .\nStay tuned .\nI can only conclude that the climate catastrophists focused on elimination of fossil fuels above all else are exploiting and damaging children and underdeveloped countries as part of their political objectives to prioritizing elimination of fossil fuels above all else .\nIf children and developing countries are collateral damage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to have forgotten their original virtue signaling of eliminating fossil fuels for the sake of the children and the underdeveloped countries . )\nTaking # 9 back to the children with psychological injuries : they are being fed ( via media targeted at them , educational materials , even story books ) an explicitly political message that relates to the inadequate government response .\nWell I have spent most of my career as an educator , and it is a rare high school student ( not to mention the alarmed children who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of what their state/national government is doing on a particular policy issue , let alone a framework for assessing what the government should be expected to do .\nSimplistic , alarming and political messaging targeted specifically at young people is clearly responsible for this .\nConsider this counterfactual scenario , whereby 1oC of warming has occurred over the past 100 years owing to natural processes ( such a rate of warming is far from unprecedented in the Holocene ; notably the period following the Younger Dryas ) .\nWould people necessarily think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presumably people in different climate regimes would have different opinions about that .\nWould people blame extreme weather events on the slow creep of warming ?\nWithout any rationale for blaming humans for extreme weather events , would anyone bother to try blaming severe weather on the slow creep of warming ?\nAnd finally , would anyone expect ( or even want ) the government to attempt to control the climate by drawing down CO from the atmosphere or promote cooling through solar geo-engineering ?\nOf course not .\nThe actual experience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t been bad at all : life expectancy has increased substantially , economies have prospered , and loss of life from weather catastrophes has been greatly reduced .\nRegions encountering extreme weather events have worked to adapt to them , with affluent countries being better adapted .\nThe problem here is not not the climate change that has already happened , but rather \u201c pre-traumatic stress syndrome \u201d ( see these previous posts ) .\nClimate change pre-traumatic stress response is triggered by the continuing barrage in the media of extreme weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , \u201d the apocalyptic projections of future warming from unrealistic emissions scenario , and dystopian warnings of impacts from irresponsible politicians and leading journalists .\nThe net effect of all this apocalyptic rhetoric , which effectively exploits how humans misperceive risk , is to increase neurotic worrying in many people ( particularly children ) , which can indeed make people more vulnerable to negative stress reactions .\n[ LINK ] Congratulations to all the proselytizers of climate doom , you have finally demonstrated an actual adverse impact of climate change that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis psychological distress is directly caused by you : the mistaken , irrational , politically motivated people that have created effective propaganda that is creating negative stress reactions particularly among children who have yet to develop a clear sense of self and lack a context for being able to filter the BS .\nIn closing I would like to return to # 3 \u2013 whether climate risk is controllable or uncontrollable .\nThe hubris of thinking that we can control atmospheric CO2 content , not to mention the actual climate itself .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rationale , the objectives of the lawsuits being filed by Our Children \u2019 s Trust are to obtain a declaration of the federal ( and state ) government \u2019 s fiduciary role in preserving the atmosphere and an injunction of its actions which contravene that role .\nAn implicit assumption of these claims is that governments can actually control the emissions into the atmosphere , as well as control the earth \u2019 s climate .\nWell , dream on .\nA key element of the psychological injuries according to the recent literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of abandonment that politicians and government are not paying attention to their concerns about the climate .\nThis concern arises from the explicitly political messaging that young people are exposed to about

surface air temperature recorded by the instrumental data is accepted almost without question by the science community as being the consequence of the progressive and global contamination of the atmosphere by CO .\nBut if they were properly inquisitive , it would not take them long see what was wrong with that over-simplification : the evidence is perfectly clear , and simple enough for any person of good will to understand .\nIn 2006 NASA Goddard published two plots showing that the USA data [ 1 ] did not follow the same warming trend as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data numerically dominate the USA archive , while urban data massively dominate almost everywhere else .\nObservations began very early in the USA \u2013 being introduced by Jefferson in 1776 \u2013 and that emphasis had already then been placed on providing assistance to farmers .\nThey are consistent with the \u2018 global warming \u2018 that so worries us today being an urban affair , caused not by global CO2 pollution of the global atmosphere but by the heat of combustion of petroleum we burn in our vehicles , our homes and where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the radiative consequences of our buildings and impermeable cement and asphalt surfaces .\nHowever , towns and cities in fact occupy only a very small fraction of the land surface of our planet , about 0.53 % ( or 1.25 % , if their densely populated suburbs are included ) according to a recent computation done with rule-based mapping .\nBut it is in this very small fraction of land surfaces that most of the data in the CRUTEM or GISTEMP archives have been recorded .\nConsequently , very few surface air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small villages which , with their farms and grazing lands , are scattered in the otherwise uninhabited grassland .\nforest , mountain , desert and tundra .\nNor is it widely understood that our presence there has been associated with progressive change since the introduction of steel and steam to plough the grasslands and to cut forests for timber .\n[ 2 ] A measure of the brightness or intensity of night lighting , the BI index , was derived by NASA from the work of Mark Imhoff , who calibrated and ranked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one rural , two peri-urban and four urban .\n[ 3 ] The BI indes for airport of Toulouse is at 59 and the central district of Cairo is at 167 .\nCare must be take with apparent anomalies similar to that of Millau which is an active little town of 20,000 people but it has a BI = 0 , as does Gourdon which has only 4000 .\nThis is because the MeteoFrance instruments at Millau have been placed on a bare hilltop on the far side of a deep , unbuilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they record only the conditions of the surrounding countryside .\nIt is not only in major cities that the effects of urbanisation can be detected ; this effect can also be detected in data from some very small places that would otherwise be considered rural as at Lerwick , a port in the Orkney Islands with a population of < 7000 .\nHere , the GHCN-M data from KNMI show a warming of about 0.9oC over the period 1978-2018 , while during the same period the day/night temperature difference increased by 0.3oC .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of urban warming .\nBut Gourdon , a compact little rural village not far from my home in western France has a BI of only 7 for a population of only 3900 .\nIt is situated in farmland that was abandoned 150 years ago when the vines died , and it is now given over to sheep , goats and scrub vegetation .\nLittle hamlets in this region are now often dark at night and their road signs may warn you that you are entering a \u00b4Starlit village\u00b4 .\nDespite its deep isolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station in Gourdon which over a 60-year period has recorded a very gradual and small summer warming since mid-20th century , associated with perfectly stable winter conditions .\nSince buildings and human activity have undoubtedly changed at Gourdon in this long period , perhaps especially by the growth of rural tourism , this effect was probably predictable .\nThe same is seen in data from other small places such as Lerwick , a port in the Orkney Islands with a population about twice that of Gourdon .\nHere , GHCN-M data from KNMI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period 1978-2018 while during the same period the day/night temperature difference increased by 0.3oC .\nThe BI values for night lighting are in no way influenced by fact that the thermometric data with which each is associated have later been merged with data from another station to achieve regional homogeneity .\nConsequently , it is appropriate to associate them with night-light data in the hope of isolating the effects of local combustion of hydrocarbons in towns and cities , from what we must attribute to solar variation .\nThe consequences of homogenisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided here by the use of GHCN-M data from the KNMI site \u2013 which are as close to the original observations , adjusted only for on-site problems , as is now possible to get .\nThe urban warming phenomenon has been observed and understood for almost two hundred years .\nMeteorologist Luke Howard ( quoted by H.H .\nLamb ) wrote in 1833 concerning his studies of temperature at the Royal Society building in central London and also at Tottenham and Plaistow , then some distance beyond the town : \u2018 But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered as that of the climate ; it partakes too much of an artificial warmth , induced by its structure , by a crowded population , and the consumption of great quantities of fuel in fires : as will appear by what follows\u2026.we find London always warmer than the country , the average excess of its temperature being 1.579\u00b0F\u2026.a considerable portion of heated air is continually poured into the common mass from the chimnies ; to which we have to add the heat diffused in all directions , from founderies , breweries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and culinary fire.. \u2019 [ 4 ] To Luke Howard \u2019 s list must now be added the consequences of the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels in vehicles , mass transport systems , power plants and industrial enterprises located within the urban perimeter , cement/asphalt surfaces and their relative contributions day and night .\n[ 5 ] The energy budget of the agglomeration of Toulouse in southern France is probably typical of such places : anthropogenic heat release is of order 100 Wm2 in winter and 25 W m-2 in summer in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residential suburbs .\nObservations of resulting evolution of surface air temperatures in central Toulouse are compatible with the anticipated effect of the inventory of all heat sources seasonally .\nBelow the urban canopy layer , a budget for heat production and loss through advection into surrounding rural areas has been computed and it is found that this loss is important under some wind conditions .\nIn this and many other urbanisations , there is also an important seasonality of heat release by passing road traffic that forms a major component of the heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass close to major centres of population .\n[ 6 ] Larger cities , larger effects : in the core of the city of Tokyo during the 1990s the seasonal heat flux range was 400-1600 W.m-2 and the entire Tokyo coastal plain appears to be contaminated by urban heat generated within the city , especially in summer when warming may extend to 1 km altitude , much higher than the simple nocturnal heat island over large cities .\n[ 7 ] The long-term evolution of urban climates is well illustrated in Europe where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20th century when their natural association with regional climate was abruptly replaced by a simple warming trend that took them almost 2oC above the base-line of the previous 250 years .\nAlthough , globally , the energy from urban heat is equivalent to only a very small fraction of heat transported in the atmosphere , models suggest that it may be capable of disrupting natural circulation patterns sufficiently to induce distant as well as local effects on the global surface air temperature pattern .\nSignificant release of this heat into the lower atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions \u2013 eastern North America , western Europe and eastern Asia \u2013 but the inclusion of this regional injection of heat ( as a steady input at 86 model points where it exceeds 0.4W m2 ) has been tested in the NCAR Community Atmospheric model CAM3 .\nComparison of the control and perturbation runs showed significant regional effects from the release of heat from these three regions at 86 grid points where observations of fossil fuel use suggest that it exceeds 0.4 Wm-2 .\nIn winter at high northern latitudes , very significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authors , \u2018 there is strong warming up to 1oK in Russia and northern Asia\u2026 .\nthe north-eastern US and southern Canada have significant warming , up to 0.8 K in the Canadian Prairies \u2019 .\nThe suggestion that the global surface air temperature data \u2013 on which the hypothesis of anthropogenic climate warming hangs \u2013 are heavily contaminated by other heat sources is not novel .\nThe map below shows the locations of 173 stations used by MacKittrick and Michaels for a statistical analysis of the contamination of the global temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they rejected the null hypothesis that the spatial pattern of temperature trends is independent of socio-economic effects which was , and still is , the position taken by the IPCC \u2013 for which MacKittrick was then a reviewer .\n[ 8 ] In the present context , this study seemed worth repeating , so a file of 31 clusters of BI indices was gathered from the \u2018 Get Neighbours \u2019 lists that are shown when accessing GISTEMP data .\nThese clusters comprise 1200 data files representing 776 towns or cities and 424 rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark at night .\nThey therefore represent a wide range of individual station histories \u2013 many longer than 100 years \u2013 and are sufficient for the task .\nJust 53 of the 540 rural sites listed are in Western Europe , the remainder being located in the vast , night-dark expanses of Asia \u2013 where the data based on the arctic island of Novaya Zemyla includes only three with significant night lights , of which one is the city of Murmansk .\nThe cluster centred southeast of Lake Baikal includes two cities ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 28 and 13 ) together with 39 small places \u2013 of which 28 are totally dark at night \u2013 while that immediately to the west of Baikal includes 19 such places .\nBut not all bright locations have large populations , because intensive industrial farms \u2013 solar panel energised \u2013 can dominate regional night lighting as it does at in some Gulf States : an experimental farm alone here generates a BI of 122 , while the 3012 people who live at Shiwaik generate a BI of 181 .\nThe map below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation to the distribution of native vegetation type .\n[ 9 ] These data may be used to investigate the supposed warming of Europe and Asia that so worries the public .\nIn far eastern Russia and neighbouring territories 8 clusters are listed which include 296 place-names lacking any night-lighting at all , together with just five small towns having night-light indices of only 1 .\nIn such places , it is the natural cycle of climate conditions \u2013 modified locally by progressive anthropogenic change in ground cover \u2013 that dominates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rural regions there is a rather simple relationship between population size and BI .\nTowns and villages occupy only a very small fraction of the continental land surface of our planet , currently about 0.53 % \u2013 or 1.25 % if their densely-populated suburbs are included \u2013 according to a recent study using rule-based mapping .\nAlthough it is peripheral to the present discussion , it must be emphasised that conditions in the sparsely-inhabited rural or natural regions are not static at secular scale \u2013 everywhere , including in Asia , grasslands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and forests clear-cut and replaced with secondary growth .\nConsequently , the distribution of population is highly aggregated and associated \u2013 as it must be \u2013 with regional economic development .\nThis is illustrated in the images below which show that in western Europe access to the sea is critical , as it is in Japan , while in night-dark Ukraine and Russia it is the zones of temperate broadleaf forest and temperate steppe in which settlement and urban development has been most active .\n[ 10 ] The arctic tundra belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few industrialised cities , of which Archangelsk is the largest .\nAlthough , globally , the energy from heat of combustion is equivalent to only a very small fraction of the energy transported in the atmosphere , models suggest that it may be capable of disrupting natural circulation patterns sufficiently to induce distant as well as local effects on the global SAT pattern derived from observations .\nSignificant release of this heat into the lower atmosphere is concentrated in three relatively small mid-latitude regions \u2013 eastern North America , western Europe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this regional injection of heat ( as a steady input at 86 model points where it exceeds 0.4W m2 ) in the NCAR Community Atmospheric model CAM3 has important but distant regional effects , especially in winter .\nComparisons of control and perturbation runs show significant regional effects from the release of heat from these three regions at 86 grid points at which observations of fossil fuel use suggest that it exceeds 0.4 Wm-2 : specifically , in winter at high northern latitudes , very significant temperature changes are induced : according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warming up to 1oK in Russia and northern Asia\u2026 .\nthe north-eastern US and southern Canada have significant warming , up to 0.8 K in the Canadian Prairies \u2019

with regional economic development .\nThis is illustrated in the image above which shows that in western Europe access to the sea is critical , as it is in Japan , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zones of temperate broadleaf forest and temperate steppe in which settlement and urban development has been most active .\n[ 11 ] In eastern Asia , 8 clusters include 268 places that are dark at night , together with just 47 having some night-lighting , mostly of intensity < 20 .\nThey include only one city ( BI = 153 ) .\nIn such regions , it is the multi-decadal cycle of solar brilliance that dominates the evolution of air temperature , modified by local effects of change in vegetation and ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misuse of the term \u2018 rural \u2019 to apply it to the small inhabited places scattered across northern Asia , for this implies some similarity with landscapes such as surrounds Gourdon , devoted now or in the past to farming and herding .\nBut small villages in asiatic Russia have nothing to do with rurality : their houses and streets have simply been set down in natural terrain \u2013 in the wildlands , if you will \u2013 that is subsequently ignored ; there are no crops , gardens or greenhouses , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe wide unpaved streets bear very few motor vehicles \u2013 and there is no street lighting .\nMany are described as administrative centres and some have a small dirt runway for light aircraft , while a few seem not to be connected to the rest of the world by dirt roads even seasonally , Here are two small places in northern Siberia with very different seasonal temperature regimes , of which one is clearly well on its way to urbanisation .\nEach lies between 65-70oN on the banks of the river Lena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded in 1632 by Cossacks sent to pacify and tax the region ; it is now an administrative centre housing 3500 people.\n, laid out beside the river on a rectangular grid .\nUntil the Lena freezes , it has no road access to the outside in winter .\nKjusjur , just south of the mouth of the Lena in a subarctic environment , was founded in 1924 as the administrative centre for this region , and has a population of 1345 ; routine meteorological data began to be collected in 1924 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one larger building are set on unpaved streets beside the stony bank of te river ; it has neither runway nor river landing place , but rough tracks leave the settlement to north and south which must be impassable much of the year .\n[ 12 ] Two motor vehicles can be seen in Kjusjur and a few small boats are pulled up on the beach , while there are about ten motor vehicles in Zhigansk and neither place has any street lighting .\nZhigansk has a dirt airstrip with a radar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station .\nEach has a temperature regime appropriate to its situation , and although it was what I was looking for , I am surprised by the strength of the response to urbanisation at Zhigansk .\nI was also expecting that each would respond \u2013 at least in very general terms \u2013 to solar forcing , and so it does : the cooling of the 1940s and 50s which caused us so much concern in those years about a coming glaciation is clear .\nA compilation of arctic data and proxies took 64oN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , within which 59 stations were used to analyse the pattern of regional co-variability for SAT anomalies based on PCA techniques .\n[ 13 ] This demonstrated quasi-periodicity of 50-80 years in ice cover in the Svalbard region : at least eight previous periods of relatively low ice cover can be identified back to about 1200 .\nHindcasting climate states is not easy : a recent synthesis of tree-ring data from the Yamal peninsula rashly states that in Siberia the \u2018 industrial era warming is unprecedented\u2026 .\nelevated summer temperatures above those\u2026for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents and observations show that this is one generalisation too far .\nIn summer 1846 , as recorded by H.H .\nLamb , warming across the arctic extended from Archangel to eastern Siberia , where the captain of a Russian survey ship noted that the River Lena was hard to locate in a vast , flooded landscape and could be followed only by the \u2018 rushing of the stream \u2019 which \u2018 rolled trees , moss and large masses of peat \u2019 against his ship , that secured from the flood \u2018 an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature reconstruction below is from annual growth of larches on the Yamal peninisula at the mouth of the Ob .\n[ 14 ] It testifies that the early decades of the 19th century did indeed include a period of very cold conditions on the arctic coast , while supporting the reality of periods of warmth likely to caused melting of the permafrost of tundra regions .\nIn any case , irruptions of warm Atlantic water into the eastern Arctic \u2013 including the present one \u2013 are well recorded in the archives of whaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The present period of a warm Arctic climate is not novel and there is an abundant record from the cod fisheries in the Barents Sea and beyond , not to speak of the documentation concerning the intermittence of open seas from the sealers and whalers in northern waters .\nThe surface air temperature data are dominated by observations made in towns and cities so that the secular evolution of the climate is determined not by the gaseous composition of the atmosphere , nor by solar radiation : instead , it is dominated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fossil hydrocarbons in motor cars , public transit and home heating systems , as well as in the industrial plants and factories where most of us must work .\nTo this must be added the daily accumulation of solar heat in the stonework or cement of our buildings facing each other along narrow passages .\nOne conclusion is unavoidable from this simple exploration of the surface air temperature archive : as used today by the IPCC and the climate change science community the instrumental record is not fit for purpose : it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraction of Earth \u2019 s surface where most of us spend our brief span of years indoors .\n[ 3 ] R.A.

I hope you will find it interesting .\nA little known JC fact is that my main hobby is Tai Chi .\nI am very fortunate to be studying under Master Reza Nejad , an exceptionally accomplished martial artist currently living in Reno , NV .\nHe is also the \u201c Bruce Lee of Iran \u201d [ link ; scroll down the page for cinema clips ] Master Nejad recommended me to the organizers of the 2022 International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to give a talk , which rather astonished me .\nI was getting ready to politely decline the invitation , when the wheels started turning in my head and I came up with an interesting idea for a talk .\nI decided to use the yin-yang framework as the basis for a philosophy of science talk .\nYou are probably generally familiar with the concept of yin and yang .\nYin and yang is a complex relational concept in Chinese philosophy and culture that has developed over thousands of years .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe is governed by a cosmic duality \u2013 sets of two opposing and complementing principles or cosmic energies that can be observed in nature .\nYin and yang elements come in pairs\u2014moon and the sun , female and male , dark and bright , cold and hot , passive and active , etc .\nWhile the world is composed of many different and sometimes opposing forces , these can coexist and even complement each other .\nThe nature of yin-yang lies in the interchange and interplay of the two components .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into two halves by a curved line .\nOne half of the circle is black , representing the yin side ; the other is white , for the yang side .\nThe two halves are intertwining across a spiral-like curve that splits the whole into semicircles , and the small dots represent the idea that both sides carry the seed of the other .\nThe curvy line signifies that there are no absolute separations between the two opposites .\nThe yin-yang symbol embodies both sides : duality , paradox , unity in diversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full presentation can be downloaded [ taiji science curry ] , ppt with audio ( 19 minutes ) .\nBelow is the relevant text , along with illustrative diagrams .\nWith this context , I focus my talk on how the duality of yin-yang can illuminate the climate debate and enlighten transformational scientific research .\nIn the west , the concept of yin-yang has been interpreted , applied and appropriated in many different ways .\nMy interpretation here focuses on applications of the essential duality implied by yin-yang .\nI propose that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to approach the process of science and creativity , towards fostering transformational research .\nAt the most fundamental level of scientific research , the duality of binary modes of thinking reflects the essential yin-yang tension .\nThese two modes of thinking have been described from the perspectives of economics , psychology and physics .\nThe idea of two modes of thinking has been most famously portrayed in Daniel Kahnemann \u2019 s book Thinking Fast and Slow .\nSystem 1 is the fast , automatic multitasking mode that we usually operate in , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around .\nBy contrast , System 2 is a more deliberate and focused mode of mindful intent .\nYou might think that System 2 thinking is the most important mode for scientific research .\nHowever , Guy Claxton \u2019 s most important insight in Hair Brain , Tortoise Mind is that the leisurely tortoise mind , for all its apparent aimlessness , is just as intelligent as the more logical hare brain .\nBut how can the aimless tortoise brain contribute to scientific research ?\nTim Palmer \u2019 s book The Primacy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the importance of the stochasticity of System 1 thinking in generating new ideas .\nPalmer provides an energy-based interpretation of thinking , whereby System 2 is the high-power , intensive mode .\nBy contrast , System 1 is a lower power mode where power is spread between many active tasks , so that power per active task is especially low .\nIn low power mode , the brain is susceptible to noise .\nPalmer argues that this noise can be a source of random new ideas .\nThis can explain why \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insight , often occur when we are relaxing and not concentrating hard on a problem .\nIn this relaxation mode , the presence of noise can help us jump out of a cognitive roadblock and advance our understanding .\nThe \u2018 monkey mind in Tai Chi represents brain chatter that jumps around and darts from one distraction to the other .\nOne objective of Tai Chi and Qigong movements are to bring the brain back to mindfulness ( \u2018 repulse the monkey \u2019 ) .\nPalmer \u2019 s framework suggests that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate the noise that can be the source of random new ideas .\nSo , we don \u2019 t want to entirely repulse the monkey , but manage the monkey while nourishing the tortoise .\nSo to achieve the most transformative oneness from our binary brain , the idea is to make constructive use of noise in the low-power mode .\nThis can provide new ideas , which our more analytic , power-intensive mode is failing to provide .\nWith regards to the actual scientific process , there are many fundamental dualities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of yin and yang .\nThe major dualities include My own scientific education , many decades ago , was focused on the attributes that I have listed on the Yin side .\nOver time , my research has migrated in the directions that are characterized by the Yang side .\nThese two opposing and complementary approaches , when appropriately integrated , can produce transformational research .\nIn addressing a specific scientific problem , frames shape how we conceptualize it .\nFraming includes what is deemed to be relevant , what is excluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate .\nA framing bias occurs when a narrow frame pre-ordains the conclusion to a much more complex problem .\nOn the other hand , if we frame a simple problem too broadly , finding a solution can be much more difficult .\nSome problems are tame , in the sense that the appropriate boundaries are clear .\nThis includes problems of engineering and laboratory science for which reductionism , order and control are the appropriate guiding principles .\nHowever , tame problems are not necessarily simple ones .\nTame problems can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are causally linked .\nComplex problems are different from those that are merely complicated .\nIn the presence of feedbacks and circularity , causal mechanisms are not easily elucidated .\nProblems related to the environment , such as climate change , and most problems related to human health are complex problems .\nComplex problems require a much larger frame to accommodate uncertainty , ambiguity , chaos , and contradictions .\nAny framing of a complex problem is provisional , requiring acknowledgement of what is outside the frame and its potential importance .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change .\nOn the left , the climate change problem is framed as being caused by excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , which can be solved by eliminating fossil fuel emissions .\nBoth the problem and solution are included in a single frame .\nThis framing dominates the UN negotiations on climate change , most recently at the Conference of the Parties in Egypt .\nThe framing on the right shows two separate frames , one associated with the causes of climate change and the other associated with solutions that can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger frame on the right also includes natural causes for climate change such as the sun , volcanoes and slow circulations in the ocean .\nThis framing is provisional , acknowledging that our understanding is incomplete and that there may be unknown processes influencing climate change .\nThe frame on the left is about controlling the climate , whereas the frame on the right is about understanding the climate .\nFurther , the framing on the right acknowledges the futility of control .\nSolutions on the right focus on the basic human necessities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Economic development supports these necessities while reducing our vulnerability to weather and climate extremes .\nMy own understanding of climate change and human well being is squarely in the framing on the right .\nThe duality here lies in science versus policy , and these two framings reflect very different visions for how science and policy interact .\nUsing the framework of normal and postnormal science , the pandemic provides insights into how we understand and conduct science , particularly when it is relevant for urgent policy making .\nNormal science is conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consensus over the problems , concepts and model solutions that together form a paradigm .\nThere have been some great successes for normal science during the pandemic .\nThese include rapid identification of viral structures and pathological mechanisms , and rapid development of vaccines and antiviral drugs .\nThe epidemiology of the pandemic provided far greater challenges .\nEarly in the pandemic , scientists , at least in the west , spoke with one voice and great authority .\nThey claimed that 2 to 3 out of every 100 infected people will die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfaces , there was no immunity after infection , and all ages were equally at risk .\nThese claims guided early covid policy in the U.S .\nHowever , these claims did not survive further scientific scrutiny and turned out to be wrong .\nMany of these early policies backfired in tragic ways , particularly for the elderly and children .\nSo what went wrong ?\nThe scientists failed to acknowledge uncertainty and ignorance .\nAn elite group of scientists manufactured a consensus in an attempt to assert authority with the objective of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreement and cancel scientists who disagreed delayed resolution of these mistaken claims and perpetuated these early bad policies .\nThe pandemic is clearly an issue for which facts are uncertain , values are in dispute , stakes are high & decisions are urgent , which characterizes post-normal science .\nPost-normal science doesn \u2019 t seek to control , but rather to manage , in a way that seeks robustness in policy strategies .\nIn postnormal science , management of uncertainty and evaluating knowledge quality are paramount .\nPostnormal science seeks to diversify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurs in context of an extended peer community that enables broader scientific and public contributions , understanding and acceptance .\nWicked problems are challenges that share some commonality with postnormal science , but there are key differences .\nWicked problems are characterized by structural complexity , irreducible uncertainties and ignorance .\nThere are multiple problem definitions and contentious methods of understanding .\nClashing values are in play , and people don \u2019 t even agree on the attributes of desirable solutions .\nThere are unintended consequences associated with all proposed solutions .\nBoth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe wickedness of wicked problems is related to the duality of science and politics .\nThere are two common but inappropriate ways of mixing science and politics .\nThe first is scientizing policy , which deals with intractable political conflict by transforming the political issues into scientific ones .\nThe problem is that science is not designed to answer questions about how the world ought to be , which is the domain of politics .\nThe second is politicization of science , whereby scientific research is influenced or manipulated in support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of these inappropriate ways of mixing science and politics in dealing with the pandemic and also climate change .\nThere \u2019 s a third way , which is known as wicked science .\nWicked science is tailored to the dual scientific and political natures of wicked societal problems .\nWicked science uses approaches from complexity science and systems thinking in a context that engages with decision makers and other stakeholders .\nWicked science requires a transdisciplinary approach that treats uncertainty as of paramount importance .\nEffective use of wicked science requires that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the future is unknown .\nEffective politics provides room for dissent and disagreement about policy options , and includes a broad range of stakeholders .\nAs an example of wicked science , I put forward my forthcoming book Climate Uncertainty and Risk .\nThis book encompasses my own philosophy for navigating wicked problems , and provides a slice through the wicked terrain of climate change .\nThe book is massively transdisciplinary , including perspectives from science , technology , politics , policy , philosophy , social psychology , uncertainty and risk .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 250 pages required careful framing .\nThe main point of this slide is to describe the duality of my binary brain in grappling with the research , framing and writing about this wicked problem .\nFor each topic I started in yin mode with a provisional outline .\nI then switched to yang mode where for each topic I read many articles and books and took copious notes .\nOf central importance was noise generation that was driven by imaginative internet searching , which helped generate ideas that took me in new directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might spend several weeks in this noise generation mode , with sporadic excursions into yin mode where I would slowly winnow down my notes and move things around to create linkages between ideas .\nAt some point the connections in my head would produce a mental model and a substantially revised outline .\nI would then return to Yin mode , where the writing proceeded quickly .\nI often felt frustrated that I was spending so much time googling around and generating noise , but upon reflection I realized that this was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context of this wicked problem .\n30 years ago , I wouldn \u2019 t have been able to write this book , without near-instantaneous access to diverse resources online that are enabled by the internet .\nThe internet is a great enabler for the practice of wicked science .\nThese approaches to thinking about science are relevant for Taiji and health sciences , which is the focus of this Forum .\nThere are several dualities here .\nThe most important one is the duality between the eastern and western approaches to medicine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eastern approach being more of a whole body approach .\nAnother duality is basic versus clinical research .\nThere is also the duality of curative versus preventative approaches .\nThe red arrows indicate feedbacks between health science and the practice of Taiji .\nParticipating in this Forum was an interesting cultural experience , it had quite a CCP flavor .\nThe Conference was very formal and very deferential to governmental and institutional authorities .\nMost of the presentations were in Chinese , with English subtitles .\nI find the objective of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of thinking ( particularly in context of Taiji-health ) to be interesting and worthwhile .\nIn any event , this Forum provided me with an opportunity to think in some new frameworks .\nThe slide above labelled \u201c Climate \u201d illustrates better than anything else I \u2019 ve written regarding the difference between the IPCC/UNFCCC ( yin ) approach and my own interpretation which has a much larger frame ( yang approach ) .", "author": "curryja", "url":
