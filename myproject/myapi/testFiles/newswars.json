explicitly stated that people who take the vaccine will not get COVID-19 , a statement we know ( and knew at the time ) was false .\nUnder one of the Biden policies , OSHA required that businesses employing more than 100 employees need to require vaccinations or weekly testing \u2013 which would apply to more than 80 million workers nationwide .\nTaking the lead in trying to block the mandate is the state of Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMeanwhile , several religious groups , including the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary , have filed similar cases .\nThe second policy under consideration by
