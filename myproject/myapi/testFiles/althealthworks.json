Discovered That Kills All Bacteria Scientists Throw At It", "content": "The health benefits of raw , unprocessed honey are well known , but in Australia , scientists recently made a startling discovery \u2013 that one particular , obscure type of honey is capable of killing just about everything scientists throw at it , including some of the worst bacteria known to man .\nThe findings were published in the European Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases ( June 2009 edition ) , and could hold special significance at a time when many of the world \u2019 s top antibiotics are failing , especially against resistant \u201c superbugs.\n\u201d The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey , which is produced in New Zealand and also goes by the name of jelly bush honey .\nThe honey has become so popular in the past few years that shortages have been reported and fake products have been sold , leading New Zealand manuka producers to seek trademark protection ( similar to French champagne or Scottish whiskey for example ) .\nIt even caught on like wildfire in the U.S. when celebrity Kourtney Kardashian tweeted about her obsession with manuka honey , which she said she began using after having her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand ambassador for the Manuka Doctor skincare line .\n\u201c After I had ( her son ) Mason , I stopped taking medicine\u2014I just changed my lifestyle and felt like I wanted the most natural things that I could find and so I became really into Manuka honey.\n\u201d It \u2019 s easy to see why now that the secret is out about this honey \u2019 s incredible health benefits , and it doesn \u2019 t take a celebrity to see the biggest reason why .\nManuka honey is created by bees foraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Zealand manuka bush , as well as tea trees native only to Australia and New Zealand .\nIn the aforementioned studies , Australian researchers found that the honey killed every bacteria or pathogen it was tested on , according to a report by The Australian .\nThe honey can be applied topically to help fight against infections of the skin , cuts and insect bites , or taken internally .\nThe most exciting difference with the manuka honey that was tested is that none of superbugs killed by the honey were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common problem with today \u2019 s antibiotics .\n\u201c New antibiotics tend to have short shelf lives , as the bacteria they attack quickly become resistant , \u201d said Dr. Dee Carter of the University of Sydney \u2019 s School of Molecular and Microbial Biosciences .\n\u201c Many large pharmaceutical companies have abandoned antibiotic production because of the difficulty of recovering costs .\nDeveloping effective alternatives could therefore save many lives.\n\u201d According to Dr. Carter the manuka honey contains a compound called methyglyoxal , that combines with other unknown compounds to cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacteria .\nManuka honey is now sold in health food stores and online , although the supply levels have fluctuated in recent years and fake honey scams have been documented .\nWhen looking for manuka honey it is best to look for one that is UMF certified .\nThe term UMF stands for Unique Manuka Factor , which is the phytochemical property derived from the manuka bushes that gives it its unique properties .\nThis term is regulated by the Unique Manuka Factor Honey Association of New Zealand and a handful of certified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe brand Comvita manuka honey is available on Amazon and is UMF certified .\nOne particular customer on Amazon said that it this type of honey helped to erase their MRSA : I had done a fair amount of research when a friend of ours got MRSA , and then , unfortunately , I got it too.\n, said user JoshuaOne9 on Amazon .\nThankfully , I had already done the research so I knew exactly what to do .\nAs soon as I saw the red bump ( thinking the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I scratched it , but the second day I realized that it had to be something else .\nMy husband immediately knew what it was since we had been dealing with our friend \u2019 s case of MRSA .\nI got my hands on this Manuka honey and put on the area of skin that was affected and then it is very important that you cover it with a bandaid .\nWithin hours I felt relief and within a few days it was completely gone\u2026 While further research needs to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that manuka honey shows plenty of promise in defeating one of the biggest health challenges faced by humanity in the 21st century , and this research should not be taken lightly .\nThis article is for informational

becoming more and more aware of the genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) and other harmful synthetic ingredients in their food , companies are scrambling to find new ways to do what they \u2019 ve been doing to unsuspecting shoppers for years : to make them think what they \u2019 re buying is all-natural even when it \u2019 s clearly not .\nYou may recall the scene from the popular movie \u2018 Food , Inc. \u2019 during which a scan of grocery store products was done , showcasing all of the \u201c wholesome \u201d and \u201c family farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into thinking they were buying something other than mass-produced , factory farm fare .\nThis sort of \u201c natural by association \u201d ( or \u201c organic by association ) marketing push from big food companies is designed to lull consumers into a false sense of security through the use of new branding efforts so that they \u2019 ll add such products into their shopping carts now and ask questions later .\nOne such new grocery store brand is the \u2018 Simple Truth \u2019 line from Kroger , the popular Ohio-based grocer .\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Superior Court of Los Angeles County claiming that the line \u2019 s poultry products feature misleading labels , however .\nThe suit alleges that Simple Truth poultry products are \u201c raised in the same close confines \u201d that are standard at large poultry farms .\n\u201c Looking to profit from growing consumer awareness of , and concern with , the treatment of farm animals raised for meat production , Kroger engaged in a deceptive and misleading marketing scheme to promote its \u2018 Simple Truth \u2019 store brand chicken as having been sourced from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humane environment \u2019 , \u201d reads the complaint .\nKroger fought and opposed the claims but eventually settled the lawsuit in October of that year before removing the label from its Simple Truth packaging .\nWhile once again we may never know the truth , it \u2019 s just an example of why it \u2019 s so important to keep companies honest and to question everything .\nThis type of alleged deception is one reason why some consumers are overly cautious about spending extra money on organic and \u201c natural \u201d foods .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural by association \u201d food product lines reveals even more to be cautious about .\nWhat is the \u2018 Simple Truth , \u2019 Anyway ?\nWhile the Simple Truth brand at Kroger does offer products with fewer ingredients in general and less of the at-risk ingredients including preservatives and synthetic additives , it is well worth noting that many of these products contain likely genetically modified ingredients .\nRecently not too long after the lawsuit news broke , I visited a local Kroger and did a random scan of Simple Truth products .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ GMOs with ingredients including \u201c corn \u201d and \u201c canola ( oil ) \u201d not featuring any designation as to whether or not they are GMO .\nConsidering that the vast majority of all corn and canola in the U.S. is genetically modified , there \u2019 s a strong likelihood that these products indeed contain GMOs and are therefore far from \u201c Simple.\n\u201d Unofficially , Simple Truth products were more likely to be non-GMO than not , but without clear labels as to whether they are , the new name is useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra feelings of trust in the informed consumer .\nPictures below showing vegetable chips cooked in unlabeled ( as to whether it \u2019 s GMO or not ) canola oil ( or safflower oil which is non-GMO ) and Greek Yogurt from unlabeled ( \u201c \u201d ) cow \u2019 s milk add to the reservations about the product line .\nThe Greek yogurt below may be considered \u201c healthy \u201d by the general public , but considering it \u2019 s pasteurized and almost certainly made from cows that ate plenty of GMOs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as \u201c simple \u201d and \u201c healthy \u201d or even \u201c natural , \u201d if our goal is to preserve the integrity of the \u201c natural \u201d term , that is .\nOther Product Lines to Watch Out For If you \u2019 d like to view the list of the 101 different items Simple Truth products are \u201c free from , \u201d you can view it on Kroger \u2019 s website \u2014 but buyer beware , as the company makes no claims of avoiding GMO ingredients within this list , unless you happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course .\nIn addition to Simple Truth , other product lines have been released by major chain stores , each of them attempting to put the correct marketing \u201c spin \u201d on ambiguously natural products .\nThe drug store chain CVS for example has a \u2018 Just the Basics \u2019 product line that includes dried snacks , cereal and much more in a more basic overall package to make it seem \u201c natural by association.\n\u201d But this line contains likely GMOs as well .\nEven Whole Foods \u2019 \u2018 365 \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , something a good portion of consumers don \u2019 t realize ( Whole Foods announced it would only label GMOs , not ban then from their stores , by 2018 ) .\nWith so much unused produce and so many ingredients floating around out there due to consumer rejection of GMO and unnatural products , it \u2019 s only \u201c natural \u201d that more and more stores and companies will now work to find new ways to brand and market them .\nTheir goal is to keep the GMO issue on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the norm to unsuspecting consumers .\nThat \u2019 s where you come in , of course .\nStick to the \u201c basics , \u201d buy more whole foods , read the labels like always and know at-risk ingredients , and you should be fine .\nThanks for reading !\nThis article was first written in November 2015 and updated on June 2 , 2021 .\nIf you \u2019 re

at the beginning of September and I got a nice review on Publisher \u2019 s Weekly .\nSo , I write about the brain chemicals that make us feel good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other books are about four chemicals ; dopamine , serotonin , oxytocin and endorphins .\nThe chemical that triggers good feelings about status and motivates us to seek status is serotonin ; I decided to devote a whole book to that because it is so complicated to understand and accept .\nI signed a contract just before the lockdown , and had been happily writing it since then .\nDopamine is the one often blamed with the habit of seeking .\nPeople are always seeking the next thing .\nThat \u2019 s the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to motivate you and to make you feel good when you have a positive expectation ; \u201c I \u2019 m expecting something good.\n\u201d Serotonin I feel is important to be proud , confident and strong , that \u2019 s serotonin .\nNM : What do you think about people using social media in an attempt to produce more of these chemicals , is that a bad thing in your opinion ?\nLB : The way people are blaming these feelings on social media today is not really something I agree with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of time .\nMy books are about how animals have these type of behaviors , which I explain .\nThat \u2019 s why every generation finds new ways to seek these chemicals with whatever technology becomes available .\nreport this adOur brains are wired by past experience so whatever triggered your happy chemicals when you were young , the neurons connected .\nThey \u2019 re not connected when we \u2019 re young .\nYou get a ( similarly delivered ) message from your coworker and you \u2019 re likely to perceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your cortisol and consider it a threat because you already have that chemical .\nLB ( continued ) : So if a person receiving it could interpret it in a positive way that would be nice , but ( oftentimes ) they might interpret it in a bad way like , Loretta is

be a bad response , it was just an old circuit turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel may be new , but they can feel like an unhealthy circuit which is old .\nLike a lens , every brain builds that lens to see the world through their own lens .\nNM : How does this work in the animal kingdom , and what role do the animal parts of our brain work in perceiving these messages either positively or negatively ?\nLB : So the way it works in the animal world is that if an animal wants a banana and it reaches for that banana , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could bite it .\nSo you feel like you want to protect yourself from getting bitten more than you want the banana , so your brain is always comparing yourself to other people and the brain releases the threat chemical cortisol to look for an opportunity to be in a position of strength .\nIf I compare myself to others I feel I \u2019 m the strong , then my brain releases the chemicals and I reach for the banana .\nIf someone always thinks they \u2019 re the weaker monkey ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like they don \u2019 t belong as part of the group for some reason , real or imagined ) , they never stimulate serotonin , and never stimulate themselves to take any risks to get rewards .\nWhen we compare ourselves to others we may think rational thoughts , but we are still wired to past experiences .\nThe old pathways are built during childhood and adolescence , but when you \u2019 re aware of them you can build new pathways .\nNM : Have you heard about different ways to create new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use therapy , biofeedback machines and emotional release work , and have you written about methods like these in your books ?\nLB : I \u2019 ve written a lot of books myself because I don \u2019 t really agree with what \u2019 s being done .\nBiofeedback for example , I think that \u2019 s a great step .\nMany things either create a victim feeling or they stop the old thought loop , but they don \u2019 t create a new thought loop ; you have to repeat a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build a new ( mental pathway ) .\nA lot of people don \u2019 t do that , but the inner mammal needs to feel strong and confident in its own survival skills to have an adult life , rather than to think that the world should take care of you .\nMy books explain this\u2026The simplest one is \u2019 14 Days to Sustainable Happiness , \u2019 it \u2019 s a step-by-step method to understand your old pathways for turning on these chemicals and then designing steps to build new chemicals .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ science including the habits of a happy brain , it retrains your brain to boost serotonin , dopamine and oxygen levels .\nNM : Can you talk a little bit more about how these different pathways are formed in our brains ?\nI know I often feel a lot of stress and cortisol when I need to \u201c intrude \u201d on someone else or ask for help .\nLB : We all have mirror neurons , which take in information from the people around us .\nWhen we were young the way we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people around us .\nI would guess when you were young you were exposed to a person who had a lot of these kinds of feelings of other people intruding on them .\nAnother is because we \u2019 re all wired for personal experience .\nMy brother is 15 months younger than me so when I was young , everything that was mine , it was like he was there taking it from me .\nThat was my earliest experience in life , so once you have this experience it builds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look at your world , it \u2019 s easy to find the information that fits , but you don \u2019 t see the rest of the story .\nThe more you feel like things are going to help you in the long run , the more you feel lighter , you take action , you take risks .\nAlso , you have to be realistic .\nFor example , a person who is young thinking , \u201c I \u2019 m going to be a rock star.\n\u201d If they don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star , their brain stops releasing the chemical that makes them excited , dopamine .\nWhen you \u2019 re climbing a mountain you get excited when you \u2019 re closer to the top , if not , dopamine stops .\nPractical goals and consistently taking action will build those small steps closer and every step closer releases more dopamine that leads you to take another step .\nNM : What about finances , financial difficulties and cortisol , what is the connection there that often takes place ?\nLB : I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s natural for finances to trigger our cortisol response , because when you think about money it feels like a matter of life-and-death .\nThat \u2019 s because our brains are inherited from , let \u2019 s say the caveman who had to find fire all the time , coal , food , he had to meet his immediate survival needs .\nWhen you don \u2019 t have enough money or you didn \u2019 t have enough money in the past , it \u2019 s wired to , it really feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive .\nThe brain compares survival and money in your bank account .\nSo if you grew up with a real fear of not having enough money that would be a big pathway .\nNext problem , suddenly you have enough money , do you save it or spend it all at once ?\nMy husband said if he didn \u2019 t eat his cookie right away , his big brother would grab his cookie , so you had to be in a hurry to eat it first .\n\u2018 Fourteen Days to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and find those old moments wired in certain behavior , to change the behavior .\nThat \u2019 s why it takes a lot of repetition to build a new pathway , you take small steps , you put five dollars in a savings account , the next week ten dollars in a savings account , and that repetition builds a neural pathway that makes it feel like something that will last .\nThe final thing is to understand the difference between your human brain and your animal brain , everyone has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s almost the same as animals and it controls our chemicals .\nOn top of that we have a human cortex which gives us the ability to use language and the ability to think about the future .\nWhen we talk to ourselves it is all about the human part of our brain .\nEveryone is in the same boat , so don \u2019 t worry about the social comparisons , just worry about the empowering part , you can build new pathways in small steps .\nDr. Loretta G.

Aging Loved Ones , \u2019 sat down with AltHealthWorks.com for a discussion on these and other topics related to aging , health , and coming to terms with grief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other taboo subjects .\nO \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s perspective is unique because she has spent time with countless patients in their 80s , 90s and beyond , and spent quite a bit of time with these patients and their loved ones .\nHer decades of experience as a care manager has given her unique insight into what happens during these years of patients \u2019 and their families \u2019 lives .\nThe following is our interview with Amy : AHW : What do you think people should know about the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved ones ?\nHow does it generally happen ?\nAOR : The first thing I would want you to know is , people will die on their own terms .\nBut it \u2019 s not always that way .\nI have seen this many times , people will wait for a relative to come and then they will die .\nI \u2019 ve watched sons

make it to 85 .\nDuring the Fragile Years , which the book is about , the pace of movement is generally slower .\nMy rule of thumb is , less acute care in the Fragile Years ( is generally a good thing

.\nIn the middle of dying , she said that .\nIt came from this quiet , not a lot of talking in that period of time .\nreport this adIt was a forever affirmation and validation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not forcing anything , just from being there .\nAside from those experiences , I \u2019 ve worked with a lot of different people with a lot of differing opinions on how they should be cared for in their \u2018 Fragile Years.\n\u2019 I \u2019 ve worked with people who really love going to the doctor or the pulmonologist , they see it as social time .\nOthers dread it and don \u2019 t want to go , or they don \u2019 t want to talk or take any medicine .\nOthers take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their 80s .\nThey have think their doctor is the next thing to the Dalai Llama .\nAHW : Can you tell me a little about the book and how it has been received so far ?\nAOR : I \u2019 ve had a lot of elders reading the book and giving it to their children saying this is who they \u2019 re going to be in their Fragile

written inside the drug \u2019 s insert that is available to doctors but not usually the patients .\nWhat she also did not know is that there are multiple issues to be concerned about with this

nutritional lifeline for people who are extremely sick .\nEnsure is owned by Abbott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Big Food corporation masquerading as a healthy alternative you \u2019 ll ever see .\nThe company

adding to the contributions for illnesses in the whole body , including different types of cancers .\nWhile our bodies , especially when sick , do require a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge difference between natural vitamins derived from food or natural sources , versus synthetic vitamins .\nUnfortunately , the vitamins contained in Ensure products and other commercialized \u201c health \u201d foods and supplements are almost always synthetic , and are manufactured with chemicals .\nGenerally speaking , when a new study comes out that claims that some vitamin is toxic at high levels , it is because

GMO-fed dairy products are far from ideal when it comes to health .\nFor many of us , almond milk seems like the perfect replacement .\nIt turns out it may not be the case , at least considering the way commercial almond milks are being made .\nWhile almond milk has gained a solid reputation as a healthy planted-based alternative , there are more than a few things you need to know about this beverage that most consumers are still not aware of because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertised .\nAll of which of course beg the question : shouldn \u2019 t this product actually be called almond water instead ?\nMost almond milks contain very little actual almonds according to one industry insider .\nMany also contain carrageenan to add to the drink \u2019 s thickness which has been linked to digestive problems and more .\nHow Many Almonds Are Actually in Your Almond Milk ?\nAlthough almond milk does not necessarily have the harmful cocktail of antibiotics , growth hormones , and the health hazards of factory farming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little in terms of true nutritional value .\nIf you \u2019 re currently drinking a glass of fresh almond milk , you may want to put it down , because this may actually infuriate you : it turns out that a half gallon carton of almond milk contains less than handful of almonds .\nTo be precise : one analysis of UK almond milk brand Alpro revealed that almonds only make up 2 % of the total drink .\nAnd when it comes to big brands in the U.S. whose bottom lines are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole lot different : one spokesperson for the Almond Board of California said that ingredient combinations are \u201c pretty similar \u201d among UK and US almond milks in this article from Business Insider .\nYou read correctly , only 2 % of almond milk is almonds .\nI think a more appropriate term should be \u201c colored water that may contain a hint of almond.\n\u201d But at least it doesn \u2019 t have any of the deadly side effects of massed produced dairy products , you might say .\nYeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It even robs almond milk of the main reason why almonds are so amazing : they \u2019 re an amazing vegetarian source of protein .\nIf almond milk has basically no almonds , it \u2019 s just an illusion of a \u201c healthy drink \u201d stuffed full of synthetic vitamins the body can barely even process .\nIf this were only one rogue almond producer cutting corners , this would not be such a big issue .\nHowever , when contacted by multiple news outlets , almond growers and processors have revealed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry standard across the board .\nHow Almond Milk Stacks Up to Regular Almonds The short answer is that almond milk simply doesn \u2019 t stack up to regular almonds .\nOne study revealed that a standard serving of almonds contains roughly 160 calories .\nA whole cup of almond milk ?\nJust a measly 30 calories , since it doesn \u2019 t have a whole lot of actual substance to it .\nAnd when it comes to the selling point of protein it \u2019 s simply depressing .\nA standard serving of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grams of healthy fat .\nA cup of almond milk , on the other hand , only has 1 gram of protein and 2.5 grams of healthy fat .\nIn other words , to get the same nutritional value as a single serving of almonds from almond milk you would have to drink roughly a carton instead of one cup .\nNo one loves almond milk that much .\nIn fact , mass produced almond milk needs a moniker more worthy of its ingredients : multivitamin water with illusions of grandeur .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothie bars , health food stores and raw food places that actually make their own almond milk on site .\nAlternatively , if you have the right hardware ( most blenders work ) , you can make your own almond milk at home rather quickly .\nThe standard online ratio for most online almond milk recipes : one cup of almonds per half gallon .\nSounds way better than just 2 % , right ?\nThis article was written by guest

report about the safety of the procedure , and claims that it is safe when done \u201c appropriately \u201d but states that some experience discomfort .\nThe stated reasons for disinsection are risks

here is the interview .\nSpecial thanks to Kevin for joining us on this one !\nQ : Can you talk about how you got into acupuncture personally , and what type of benefits did you receive after trying it for the first time , and doing it consistently ?\nKM : My career path in Chinese medicine actually began when I was young growing up in the bayou country of Louisiana where I was exposed to more alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain and discomfort was to pursue treatments that were non-pharmaceutical .\nIf I was in pain , then there was a root cause , and medicine to address the symptoms was not the best treatment .\nThrough my younger years , I had a spiritual yearning that introduced me to Siddha yoga , Zen Buddhism , Tibetan Buddhism , energy healing through the Ancient Incan prism\u2026I was a searcher and eager student .\nAcupuncture and Chinese Medicine were very intriguing to me as I also practiced various forms of martial arts through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s , I was working around the clock in digital media , training for triathlons , and burning the candle at all ends , when I decided to try acupuncture for a shoulder strain .\nI was lucky to be introduced to a very talented healer in New York , Abdi Assadi , and had a profound experience from my first treatment .\nI continued with my acupuncture treatments quite regularly , and over time developed a healthy curiosity of Chinese Medicine Theory .\nIn addition to Abdi , I developed a solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City and became a strong advocate of acupuncture to any of my friends , colleagues , and family that were in discomfort .\nAfter the economic collapse of 2008 , my executive position in digital media was eliminated and I was at a crossroads : continue working in media sales , or transition to the health & wellness space which was really calling to me as I was doing lots of volunteer work at the time .\nWhen it came down to which direction in health & wellness I should embark , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicine was something that I believed in 100 % , and I felt I could make a difference in people \u2019 s lives as it had with me .\nWith that I enrolled in graduate school for Acupuncture and never looked back .\nQ : Can you please tell me the difference between Dry Needling and other forms of acupuncture ?\nI am not familiar with it as a term , although it sounds similar to the type I \u2019 ve done !\nreport this adKM : \u201c Dry Needling \u201d is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since many PT \u2019 s are not allowed within their scope of practice to insert needles .\nAcupuncturists refer to this technique as \u201c trigger point release .\n\u201d Dry Needling/Trigger Point Release is the use of acupuncture needles to release trigger points , or knots , in muscle tissue allowing for management of neuromusculoskeletal pain and movement impairments .\nIt is highly effective in resolving muscle knots and tension , which is why PT \u2019 s want to make it a part of their treatments .\nThere is a really big turf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and LAc \u2019 s ( licensed acupuncturists ) due to this .\nMy mindset is that if PTs are properly trained how and where to needle effectively , and can help a patient recover , than it serves the goal of medicine which encompasses the relief of pain and suffering Q : What differentiates your approach in terms of Sports Medicine Acupuncture from traditional acupuncture that you would get at a traditional place or perhaps even a community acupuncture center ?\nKM : Sports Medicine Acupuncture is an advanced orthopedic approach to acupuncture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to more effectively address many sports and orthopedic injuries .\nDiagnostics include advanced manual muscle testing and postural assessments to better differentiate type of injury , and advanced treatment that includes needling motor points , trigger points , and precise orthopedic muscular techniques , in addition to Traditional Chinese Medicine acupuncture point protocols .\nQ : You said you \u2019 ve worked with teens and young adults to combat stress .\nHave you administered your techniques in schools before ?\nHow do these kids and young adults tend to react after trying acupuncture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few years ago during the height of the opioid crisis , there was a significant uptick in my area of students committing suicide and hurting themselves .\nThere was lots of pain in the community , and need for creating better coping skills for our youth .\nGiven acupuncture is noted for reducing stress and anxiety , I created a teen clinic , free of charge , for all young adults , which became well attended producing great results .\nThe treatment was \u201c community clinic \u201d style where I had multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did a basic , non-invasive ( didn \u2019 t ask too many deep emotional questions ) intake with each teen patient to determine how stress and anxiety manifested in their bodies .\nNext , they leaned back into a comfy lounge chair receiving a needle protocol designed to calm their nervous system and activate their immune system .\nThey were also given headphones with binaural music , an audio technology designed to balance the hemispheres of the brain causing the listener to fall into a forced Delta state of meditation and chill .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 minute break from their negative thought patterns and hopefully feel a sense of optimism .\nEach week we discussed additional coping mechanisms depending on their need state , such as meditation , exercise , proper diet , etc .\nQ : What would you say to someone who is scared of needles but wants to try acupuncture ?\nKM : Acupuncture is a painless , yet can have a profound effect on the body .\nI describe how it works and what they can expect to feel , then insert the needles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , checking in with the patient as the treatment progresses .\nGenerally , their fear of needles is abated once they feel the results .\nQ : Can you tell us a little bit about your new Dragon Hemp line please , and where can people find it ?\nKM : Dragon Hemp is a therapeutic line of products that blend premium grade CBD hemp with Chinese herbs and native botanicals designed to enhance performance , recovery and improve overall health and wellness .\nOver the past years , I have used CBD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to address many of the most common complaints including musculoskeletal pain and anxiety/stress/insomnia .\nIn many cases , there is an element of inflammation present in these cases .\nCBD is emerging as a promising plant medicine to address inflammatory conditions , and Chinese herbs have been used for over 2,000 years to both address inflammation and reduce pain by dispersing qi and blood stagnation .\nI have found that by blending specific herbs and botanicals with CBD has produced a more effective therapeutic result , and thus Dragon Hemp was born .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines , RELIEF Recovery formula for pain and inflammation , REACH Clarity & Focus formula , and REST sleep

herbs are organically sourced , and all are lab-tested for purity .\nQ : Do you have any books you have written , or if not , are there any books on natural health you would recommend that got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Most of my learning about the CBD hemp plant and industry came from attending the CBD and Cannabis summits in New York , California , and Colorado over the years .\nOne of my early reads on CBD and medical cannabis was \u2018 Medical Marijuana and CBD : A Physician \u2019 s Guide for Patients \u2019 by Matthew L Mintz , which became a solid early resource .\nFor Chinese herbs , the main

organisms ( GMOs ) and other harmful synthetic ingredients in their food , companies are scrambling to find new ways to do what they \u2019 ve been doing to unsuspecting shoppers for years : to make them think what they \u2019 re buying is all-natural even when it \u2019 s clearly not .\nYou may recall the scene from the popular movie \u2018 Food , Inc. \u2019 during which a scan of grocery store products was done , showcasing all of the \u201c wholesome \u201d and \u201c family farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into thinking they were buying something other than mass-produced , factory farm fare .\nThis sort of \u201c natural by association \u201d ( or \u201c organic by association ) marketing push from big food companies is designed to lull consumers into a false sense of security through the use of new branding efforts so that they \u2019 ll add such products into their shopping carts now and ask questions later .\nOne such new grocery store brand is the \u2018 Simple Truth \u2019 line from Kroger , the popular Ohio-based grocer .\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Superior Court of Los Angeles County claiming that the line \u2019 s poultry products feature misleading labels , however .\nThe suit alleges that Simple Truth poultry products are \u201c raised in the same close confines \u201d that are standard at large poultry farms .\n\u201c Looking to profit from growing consumer awareness of , and concern with , the treatment of farm animals raised for meat production , Kroger engaged in a deceptive and misleading marketing scheme to promote its \u2018 Simple Truth \u2019 store brand chicken as having been sourced from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humane environment \u2019 , \u201d reads the complaint .\nKroger fought and opposed the claims but eventually settled the lawsuit in October of that year before removing the label from its Simple Truth packaging .\nWhile once again we may never know the truth , it \u2019 s just an example of why it \u2019 s so important to keep companies honest and to question everything .\nThis type of alleged deception is one reason why some consumers are overly cautious about spending extra money on organic and \u201c natural \u201d foods .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural by association \u201d food product lines reveals even more to be cautious about .\nWhat is the \u2018 Simple Truth , \u2019 Anyway ?\nWhile the Simple Truth brand at Kroger does offer products with fewer ingredients in general and less of the at-risk ingredients including preservatives and synthetic additives , it is well worth noting that many of these products contain likely genetically modified ingredients .\nRecently not too long after the lawsuit news broke , I visited a local Kroger and did a random scan of Simple Truth products .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ GMOs with ingredients including \u201c corn \u201d and \u201c canola ( oil ) \u201d not featuring any designation as to whether or not they are GMO .\nConsidering that the vast majority of all corn and canola in the U.S. is genetically modified , there \u2019 s a strong likelihood that these products indeed contain GMOs and are therefore far from \u201c Simple.\n\u201d Unofficially , Simple Truth products were more likely to be non-GMO than not , but without clear labels as to whether they are , the new name is useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra feelings of trust in the informed consumer .\nPictures below showing vegetable chips cooked in unlabeled ( as to whether it \u2019 s GMO or not ) canola oil ( or safflower oil which is non-GMO ) and Greek Yogurt from unlabeled ( \u201c \u201d ) cow \u2019 s milk add to the reservations about the product line .\nThe Greek yogurt below may be considered \u201c healthy \u201d by the general public , but considering it \u2019 s pasteurized and almost certainly made from cows that ate plenty of GMOs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as \u201c simple \u201d and \u201c healthy \u201d or even \u201c natural , \u201d if our goal is to preserve the integrity of the \u201c natural \u201d term , that is .\nOther Product Lines to Watch Out For If you \u2019 d like to view the list of the 101 different items Simple Truth products are \u201c free from , \u201d you can view it on Kroger \u2019 s website \u2014 but buyer beware , as the company makes no claims of avoiding GMO ingredients within this list , unless you happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course .\nIn addition to Simple Truth , other product lines have been released by major chain stores , each of them attempting to put the correct marketing \u201c spin \u201d on ambiguously natural products .\nThe drug store chain CVS for example has a \u2018 Just the Basics \u2019 product line that includes dried snacks , cereal and much more in a more basic overall package to make it seem \u201c natural by association.\n\u201d But this line contains likely GMOs as well .\nEven Whole Foods \u2019 \u2018 365 \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , something a good portion of consumers don \u2019 t realize ( Whole Foods announced it would only label GMOs , not ban then from their stores , by 2018 ) .\nWith so much unused produce and so many ingredients floating around out there due to consumer rejection of GMO and unnatural products , it \u2019 s only \u201c natural \u201d that more and more stores and companies will now work to find new ways to brand and market them .\nreport this adTheir goal is to keep the GMO issue @ @ @ @ @ @

discovery \u2013 that one particular , obscure type of honey is capable of killing just about everything scientists throw at it , including some of the worst bacteria known to man .\nThe findings were published in the European Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases ( June 2009 edition ) , and could hold special significance at a time when many of the world \u2019 s top antibiotics are failing , especially against resistant \u201c superbugs.\n\u201d The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey , which is produced in New Zealand and also goes by the name of jelly bush honey .\nThe honey has become so popular in the past few years that shortages have been reported and fake products have been sold , leading New Zealand manuka producers to seek trademark protection ( similar to French champagne or Scottish whiskey for example ) .\nIt even caught on like wildfire in the U.S. when celebrity Kourtney Kardashian tweeted about her obsession with manuka honey , which she said she began using after having her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand ambassador for the Manuka Doctor skincare line .\n\u201c After I had ( her son ) Mason , I stopped taking medicine\u2014I just changed my lifestyle and felt like I wanted the most natural things that I could find and so I became really into Manuka honey.\n\u201d It \u2019 s easy to see why now that the secret is out about this honey \u2019 s incredible health benefits , and it doesn \u2019 t take a celebrity to see the biggest reason why .\nManuka honey is created by bees foraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Zealand manuka bush , as well as tea trees native only to Australia and New Zealand .\nIn the aforementioned studies , Australian researchers found that the honey killed every bacteria or pathogen it was tested on , according to a report by The Australian .\nThe honey can be applied topically to help fight against infections of the skin , cuts and insect bites , or taken internally .\nThe most exciting difference with the manuka honey that was tested is that none of superbugs killed by the honey were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common problem with today \u2019 s antibiotics .\n\u201c New antibiotics tend to have short shelf lives , as the bacteria they attack quickly become resistant , \u201d said Dr. Dee Carter of the University of Sydney \u2019 s School of Molecular and Microbial Biosciences .\n\u201c Many large pharmaceutical companies have abandoned antibiotic production because of the difficulty of recovering costs .\nDeveloping effective alternatives could therefore save many lives.\n\u201d According to Dr. Carter the manuka honey contains a compound called methyglyoxal , that combines with other unknown compounds to cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacteria .\nManuka honey is now sold in health food stores and online , although the supply levels have fluctuated in recent years and fake honey scams have been documented .\nWhen looking for manuka honey it is best to look for one that is UMF certified .\nThe term UMF stands for Unique Manuka Factor , which is the phytochemical property derived from the manuka bushes that gives it its unique properties .\nThis term is regulated by the Unique Manuka Factor Honey Association of New Zealand and a

research so I knew exactly what to do .\nAs soon as I saw the red bump ( thinking the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I scratched it , but the second day I realized that it had to be something else .\nMy husband immediately knew what it was since we had been dealing with our friend \u2019 s case of MRSA .\nI got my hands on this Manuka honey and put on the area of skin that was affected and then it is

shows plenty of promise in defeating one of the biggest health challenges faced by humanity in the 21st century , and this research should not be taken lightly .\nIf you \u2019 re looking for manuka honey in its healthiest and most medicinal form , I personally recommend buying honey that is raw and unpasteurized , as well as manuka honey with a UMF Factor Rating of 15+ , such as this one from

, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the ones to focus on .\nScrolling down , you will find the unvarnished truth .\nThis is one of the unhealthiest ingredients you could consume .\nHigh fructose corn syrup is typically made from genetically engineered ( GMO ) corn .\nGenetically modified corn makes up over 90 % of the crop each year in the United States , so it \u2019 s highly likely this ingredient is GMO

"Coconuts are one of the most renowned superfoods in the world , providing health benefits whether dried , juiced , pureed , drank from , or cooked .\nLately , nutrition scientists have been working overtime to maximize the health benefits of coconuts , creating more concentrated versions of the benefits they bring to the table .\nAmong them are a type of oil that has gained popularity within the ketogenic diet and \u201c paleo \u201d health circuits , but is still relatively unknown among the mainstream .\nIt may sound like something that is difficult to get into and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits of this highly concentrated coconut-based oil supplement are simply too numerous to count .\nThe Beneficial and Unique Properties of MCT Oil Among coconut \u2019 s many beneficial properties , the presence of medium-chain triglycerides stand out more than any other .\nThis type of fatty acid is almost exclusive to coconuts ( it \u2019 s also found in dairy products and palm kernel oil ) , and it works by providing an alternate fuel source for the brain that differs from traditional glucose .\nThese MCT substances are more quickly absorbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is why they show promise for healing people with Alzheimer \u2019 s and helping elders to memorize and retain information more effectively .\nWhen it comes to MCT oil itself , the specific benefit is that you are consuming this specific part of the coconut , which in a certain sense is the most energy-rich part .\nMost people began putting MCT oil , along with a popular product called Brain Octane Oil , after the release of the 2014 book \u2018 The Bulletproof Diet.\n\u2019 The book , written by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biohacker \u2019 named Dave Asprey , detailed a relatively strict ( yet highly enjoyable ) dietary plan based around three basic concepts : \u2022 Drinking mold-free coffee with healthy fats such as grass-fed butter , ghee , MCT oil , and Brain Octane Oil \u2022 Eating a Paleo style , low-inflammation diet packed with organic vegetables and pasture-raised , organic or regeneratively-raised meats ( like these meats from REP Provisions which are sourced from pesticide-free fields ) The goal of the diet is to flood your brain with healthy fats , and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digestion , alertness , and circulation with organic , mold-free coffee .\nThe healthy fats from coconut are a key pillar of this diet , including MCT and Brain Octane Oil , both of which contain concentrated forms of medium chain triglycerides from coconuts .\nIt \u2019 s a delicious and healthy diet that Asprey says will help him live to be somewhere in the 150 years or above range some day .\nI personally have tried this diet and I felt incredible benefits , although it was quite expensive and restrictive at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil , Brain Octane Oil , butter in my coffee , and organic MCT oil powder are \u201c hacks \u201d that I have taken with me and still use to this day .\nRecently , holistic doctor and keto diet advocate Dr. Eric Berg detailed the top health benefits of MCT oil for human health .\nAmong them are : \u2022 Better Brain and Cognitive Function\u2013 MCT oil is loaded with health saturated fats that the brain can readily use as fuel .\nIt is a more concentrated form of the \u201c rocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is why it has become such a popular supplement .\n\u2022 Reduced Hunger- While taking MCT and Brain Octane oils and powders in my coffee , I noticed I wasn \u2019 t nearly as hungry .\nMy brain had all of the fuel it needed to complete every task , while my focus and intuition remained sharp .\nTaking MCT oil is ideal for anyone who works a desk job .\nIt \u2019 s also great for anyone who has a high-pressure or high-stress job of any kind .\nJust make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat , because I personally noticed that not always eating enough was one of the potential side effects of this diet .\n\u2022 Antimicrobial Benefits- Coconut is one of the healthiest foods on Earth not just because of the energy it provides , but also because it can attack foreign invaders and pathogens in the body including viruses and other microbes ( viruses are considered to be the smallest of all microbes , with the sole purposes to multiply inside the cells of other living things ) .\n\u2022 Lowered Blood Sugar- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diabetes risk factors , including insulin resistance , in a small group of participants with Type II Diabetes .\n[ Get organic MCT powder here ] \u2022 Improves Mood- When I was on the Bulletproof Diet drinking MCT and Brain Octane Oil each morning with my \u2018 Bulletproof

something that comes with a little practice but it \u2019 s well worth it to preserve one of the more nutritious foods in your pantry ( especially if they \u2019 re sweet potatoes which are far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regular ones ) .\nRecently a meme has been circulating on the Internet that placing an apple in a bag of potatoes will keep them from sprouting , but is that exactly true ?\nRead on for tips on how to keep your potatoes from sprouting naturally .\nMost sources state that sprouted potatoes are safe to eat in moderation .\nStill , there is some concern with eating sprouting potatoes too often according to Healthline.com .\nWhen potatoes sprout , two compounds from the \u2018 glycoalkaloid \u2019 family increase .\nThese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar and cholesterol effects , but not

the simple ones , but unfortunately many people end up breaking these rules and see their potatoes go bad quicker than they should !\nTo best preserve your potatoes do the following : 1 .\nStore them in a dark place- Do not place a bag of potatoes on or around your fruit basket , or leave them exposed on the counter .\nPotatoes prefer a dark , cool place like under the cabinet preferably 50 degrees or even lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do not get them wet !\n- Potatoes that have been exposed to water will rot and/or sprout faster than the dry ones , so be sure to dry them off after you \u2019 ve washed them .\nWashing them is always a good idea since they are one of the highest pesticide containing foods out there ; but of course it \u2019 s far better to buy them organic .\nUnfortunately the organic potato market is not exactly booming right now but with the right purchases we can send a message .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Onions are capable of making them sprout faster , so avoid this combination at all costs .\n4 .\nDo not store with bananas or other fruit !\n- Storing potatoes near bananas and other fruit can also encourage them to sprout faster .\nFruit gives off ethylene gas which can cause the ripening to happen faster .\n5 .\nStore in a brown paper bag- This is one of the best ways to keep them cool and dark , as opposed to in the containers that they \u2019 re found in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf they happen to somehow get damp , let them dry off on the counter before cooking and serving .\n6 .\nAdd dried herbs or essential oils- If you \u2019 re serious about stopping potatoes from sprouting you can use dried sage , lavender and/or rosemary herbs in a cotton drawstring ( muslin ) bag .\nResearch from the University of Idaho also shows that the essential oils of clove , spearmint and peppermint can also prevent potatoes from sprouting .\nDoes the Apple Trick Work for Preventing Potato Sprouts ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ about whether placing an apple in a bag of potatoes can prevent them from sprouting early but it seems as though this was based off of experiments in the 1930s .\nRecent science suggests otherwise ; that the ethylene given off by apples during their ripening process could actually do the opposite and make potatoes sprout faster .\nAt the end of the day it \u2019 s best to follow the tips above and maybe try the apple trick out as a science experiment on a bag of cheap non-organic potatoes to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good results with it and there are others out there who have as well , but some skeptics remain .\nFinal Thoughts on Preventing Your Potatoes from Sprouting At any rate , following the above tips are your best bets to keep your potatoes from sprouting , along with cooking and using them quickly so you don \u2019 t forget about them down there in the dark .\nYou can also freeze mashed potatoes and other recipes to preserve your food and most of the nutrients .\nYou should try and use them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these tips can extend

for blood type diets these days , but D \u2019 Adamo is considered to be the most prominent ( see video below for a quick primer ) .\nThe Same Nutritional Approaches Do Not Work For Everyone We hear all the time about new diets that helped help our friends lose weight lose weight , increase vitamin absorption , reduce pain , and helped heal an ailment , et cetera .\nAnd yet when we try it , it either doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even work against us .\nRecent research shows that the reason for that may be the biochemical uniqueness of each of us .\nDr. D \u2019 Adamo believes that the blood type is one of the most important pieces of genetic information to use when creating a perfect diet protocol for an individual .\nHis research of genetics , medical history and anthropology led him to believe that blood type is \u201c the key that unlocks the door to the mysteries of health , disease , longevity , physical vitality , and emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : O , A , B , and AB , and knowing which one you have will help you navigate through the choices of personal nutrition .\nBelow you will find how Dr. D \u2019 Adamo describes each type and what he recommends for diet and lifestyle choices .\nType A : Carbohydrates are the best source of nutrients Historically people with Type A were shifting away from hunting and towards agriculture and keeping livestock .\nOver time that made them adapt to digesting carbohydrates by producing high levels of disaccharidases \u2014 digestive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time Type A have low levels of hydrochloric acid in the stomach , which is needed to digest meat .\nTherefore it is easier for Type A to be vegetarian or vegan .\nThe diet for Type A should mainly consist of fresh vegetables .\nFresh organic produce will really give the immune system a boost , which will then guard against disease .\nWhen it comes to illnesses , Type A have a naturally higher risk of diabetes , cardiovascular disease and cancer .\nThey also have higher cortisol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more susceptible to issues that have to do with stress : sleep problems , obsessive-compulsive disorder and hypothyroidism .\nTo reduce cortisol levels , it is best for Type A to avoid sugar , caffeine and alcohol .\nFinally , it is recommended that Type A eat less food but more frequently to help balance the blood sugar .\nIt is extremely important to not skip meals .\nType B : Balance is the best approach Type B carry the genetic ability to adapt to changing conditions , therefore for the diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vegetables , low-fat dairy and eggs .\nIt is best to avoid corn , wheat , buckwheat , peanuts , and lentils .\nThese foods can promote weight gain , and cause fatigue and fluid retention .\nAnother food that Dr. D \u2019 Adamo recommends eliminating is chicken , because of its lectin levels .\nLectin can cause agglutination ( cell clumping ) reactions , which can lead to strokes and autoimmune illnesses .\nInstead , the doctor recommends lamb , mutton , venison , rabbit , and goat .\nThe main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much cortisol when stressed and having a naturally greater risk for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases .\nWhen it comes to exercise , Dr. D \u2019 Adamo recommends types of activities that challenge mind as well as the body , such as martial arts , tennis and cycling .\nFor emotional well-being , Type B also benefits the most from meditation and visualization .\nType O blood carries two antibodies \u2013 for types A and B , and while that makes receiving blood transfusion challenging , this blood type has great defense mechanisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stomach acid , they are able to easily digest protein and fat .\nThey are also more adapt to healing the digestive track and absorb calcium .\nHowever , Type O have a harder time with grains , and simple sugars .\nThe best diet for Type O incorporates organic meats , vegetables and fruits , but limits wheat and dairy .\nIt is best to avoid caffeine and alcohol .\nWhen it comes to stress Type O are the \u201c fight or flight \u201d people .\nThey are more prone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThese reactions come out when Type O are bored , tired or depressed .\nTo fight boredom and promote health , Type O will benefit from regular physical activity the most out of all the blood types .\nAerobics are recommended for 30-45 minutes at least four times a week .\nType AB : Less than 5 % of the population !\nType AB is the first blood type that appeared because of intermingling and not evolution .\nThis type has a combination of characteristics of blood types A and B .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ seafood , tofu ( fermented and organic is preferable ) , dairy ( cultured is best ) , and green vegetables , which are especially good for weight loss .\nIt is best to avoid all cured and smoked meats as these foods put people at a higher risk of cancer if they have low levels of stomach acid ( something type AB inherited from type A ) .\nTo counteract digestive issues due to low stomach acid , it is recommended to eat small portions more frequently .\nType AB also has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain types of food .\nFor example , it is best to avoid starches and proteins in one meal .\nWhen it comes to physical activity , Type AB tend to overproduce adrenaline .\nAt the same time , they often internalize emotions , which may lead to build-up anger .\nEngaging in physical activity is equally important for AB \u2019 s physical and emotional health as well , as it plays a big role in their stress reduction .\nAs it always happens to any scientific hypothesis , there are those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study that is trying to disprove it .\nCanadian researchers studied the diets of 1,455 healthy young adults and compared what they ate to the four blood type diet plans .\nThe study concluded that there was not enough evidence to support the hypothesis .\nThe study however had two potential flaws .\nThe first is that they picked only young adults .\nThe younger the person is , the easier it is for their body to absorb nutrients and guard against illness no matter what the diet they follow .\nThe genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play much bigger role in the later years .\nTo really put the diet to the test , participants should have been chosen from different age groups and with different health conditions .\nSecondly , the participants were put on the diet for just one month .\nAs with most dietary changes , the body needs to adjust before any big shifts happen .\nIt would be vital to see how this diet would affect the same individuals after 3 or even 6 months .\nAnd what do the people say ?\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom this type of diet made a real difference .\nAnd the book itself \u201c Eat Right For Your Type \u201d has an almost 5-star rating out of 1,608 reviews on Amazon.com .\nReviewers are saying that the diet helped them lose weight , relieve allergies , reduce stress , even help with depression , and reduced or eliminated few dozen other symptoms .\nThere are a few people who say the diet did not work for them , but many more who had great success .\nPerhaps the blood type diet works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which not enough studies have been done yet

doesn \u2019 t end well .\nBut raw honey is different because of its natural composition , to the point where some doctors are even recommending it be taken before bedtime .\nAmong them is Dr. Ron Fessenden , MD , who authored the book \u2018 The Honey Revolution : Restoring the Health of Future Generations.\n\u2019 Fessenden is among those recommending honey as an ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken at many different times of day , but perhaps most interestingly before bed in order to support a healthy night \u2019 s sleep .\nHoney may be one of the sweetest foods out there , but that doesn \u2019 t

perfect liver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pure water , your body should have most of what it needs to perform its restorative and detoxing functions .\nAccording to this blog post from Fessenden , honey promotes a truly deep and restorative sleep in two main ways .\nFirst , it allows for an adequate supply of liver glycogen overnight while your body is fasting and stores are low .\nHe notes that the average adult liver only has about 75 to 100 grams worth of storage space for glycogen , which varies between men and women of different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumes about 10 grams of glycogen during the day , leaving our stores quite low by the time our heads hit the pillow at 11 p.m. That leaves less liver glycogen than is needed for eight hours of sleep if you ate dinner at 6 p.m. , Fessenden says .\nHowever , if you take a teaspoon or two of honey before bed , you \u2019 ll be re-stocking your liver with glycogen so that your brain doesn \u2019 t activate a stress response , which often occurs when glycogen is low .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ melatonin in the brain , as it leads to a slight spike in insulin levels and the release of tryptophan in the brain .\nTryptophan leads to serontonin which is made into melatonin in the dark .\nFinally , when adding honey to your diet at night , you \u2019 ll be supporting a healthy metabolism as your liver goes to work breaking down the toxins that are ultimately stored in fat cells .\nIn addition to the ability to help us have a restful night \u2019 s sleep , honey has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tested throughout time .\nHoney virtually never spoils , as it has been found in Egyptian tombs still intact after many hundreds of years .\nThe popular sweetener is also anti-fungal , anti-bacterial , excellent for reducing throat irritation , great for athletes , and much more , as this article notes .\nRegardless of how you use your honey , don \u2019 t forget to buy organic and raw from a local farmer : the benefits of honey have been enjoyed for thousands

Because of the documented health risks of fluoride , many people have launched campaigns to remove the chemical from their water supplies , to varying degrees of success .\nSuch initiatives usually @

coordinate these efforts and to accelerate translation of science into prevention , we propose the urgent formation of a new international clearinghouse.\n\u201d The report coincides with 2013

grains destroy their natural nutrients , and if that \u2019 s not bad enough , mills are so impatient they speed up the whitening process by bleaching flour with chlorine .\nWhite processed flour quickly raises blood sugar and insulin levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could spread cancer cells quickly by feeding the cells directly .\nMost lunch meats , sausages , hot dogs , and bacon are processed meats ,

of processed meats increased chances of early death by 44 % .\nKnown carcinogens include chemicals and preservatives like sodium nitrates .\nThis is essentially vegetable oil that has been chemically removed from the source .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly unstable Omega 6 fatty acids that turn into trans fats when heated , which can lead to heart disease and skin cancer .\nThis stuff is in a wide variety

as one of the biggest indicators of a person \u2019 s overall health .\nMaintaining a healthy gut can be a difficult job , however , considering the sheer amount of bacteria that make up our \u201c

healthy foods including both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about probiotics , which are used to mitigate the effects of antibiotics and build healthy levels of \u201c good bacteria \u201d in the body , few know the complex role that prebiotics play .\nLet \u2019 s explore , and discuss the best sources of healthy prebiotics that you may want to consider adding into your diet .\nThe Health Benefits of Prebiotics for the Gut Prebiotics are not found in a ton of foods , but the role they play in protecting and nourishing our guts can not be understated .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are basically a type of dietary fiber that help feed the colon and allow it to work as efficiently as possible , also work in tandem with probiotics to allow the \u201c good \u201d bacteria to flourish .\nWhen you add more fermented foods into your diet such as kimchi , sauerkraut , kombucha , or even its little known Tibetan cousin Jun , they go to work in your gut , producing healthy gut-friendly bacteria .\nBut

Top 8 Prebiotic Foods to Add to Your Diet Like probiotics , prebiotics come from a specialized class of foods that includes everything from fruits to seeds , vegetables , and little-known herbal remedies .\nThe top 8 prebiotic-containing foods are as follows : Probably the easiest and most convenient food to find in grocery stores and to eat consistently on this list , bananas have been shown to support gut health by reducing bloating and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBe sure to by organic whenever possible because conventional varieties may essentially be \u201c cloned.\n\u201d About 95 % of them come from a single variety , Cavendish , and are seedless .\nThese bananas may still be relatively healthy in the short term , but why bother when organic bananas are only a few cents cheaper on average ?\nOften used as a replacement for coffee , chicory root is usually brewed like a tea and can be drank as a complement to meals encouraging healthy digestion .\nWhat makes chicory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is comprised of about 47 % inulin , the fibrous compound that nourishes gut bacteria , improves digestion and helps relieve symptoms of constipation , according to recent studies and this article from Dr. Arlene Semeco .\nThese powerful vegetables are not only excellent for building the body because of its relatively high mineral and protein content , but they also contain a high amount of inulin : as much as 2-3 grams per serving .\nPair asparagus with enough healthy probiotic foods and eat it consistently and you have a recipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to why apples are so benefical for gut health , it \u2019 s important to note that this is one fruit that should always be consumed organic .\nApples are banned throughout Europe because of the chemicals we treat them with here in the United States , and are high in pesticides when bought from the \u201c conventional \u201d section in the grocery store .\nThat being said , you can \u2019 t go wrong with apples when it comes to promoting and

produce butyrate , a short-chain fatty acid that nourishes the good bacteria in your bacteria while also decreasing the bad bacteria , as Dr. Semeco notes .\nIn addition to asparagus , prebiotic fiber can also be found in cruciferous vegetables including broccoli , cabbage , and cauliflower .\nAll of these vegetables are also excellent for cancer prevention in addition to their prebiotic benefits .\nIf you can \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your diet , you may want to try organic inulin powder instead .\nInulin powder is a prebiotic supplement that feeds the probiotics in your gut .\nIt \u2019 s more convenient than eating vegetables and can be taken morning and night .\nTake one full scoop of this organic powder daily , three times a day .\nThis will help to feed the \u201c good \u201d bacteria in your gut so they stay healthy and outnumber the bad guys .\nWhile the Jerusalem artichoke is not something most people likely to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean it should be discarded .\nThis rarely eaten vegetable happens to be even better at helping to proliferate healthy gut bacteria than chicory root , as 76 % of its dietary fiber comes from inulin .\nThe Jerusalem artichoke can be found in the produce section of select grocery stores or at farmer \u2019 s markets , and goes well baked or roasted in the oven tossed in olive oil and spices at about 350 degrees for 35-45 minutes .\nYou can also find Jerusalem artichoke in the supplement aisle or online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inulin powder that helps to improve your body \u2019 s absorption of electrolytes like calcium and magnesium , while also helping it to produce more beneficial gut bacteria .\nSimilar in properties with high sulphur and natural antibacterial content , onions and garlic ( along with their lesser-known cousins , the leek ) contain high levels of prebiotics including fructooligosaccharides ( FOS ) , another type of prebiotic found in many of the foods on this list .\nIn addition to its well known high-magnesium benefits and antioxidants , cacaos flavanol compounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gut bacteria , and may lower cholesterol and improve heart health as well according to Dr. Semeco .\nWhen buying cacao , look for brands that are lower in sugar and high in actual cacao content .\nMany popular chocolate brands get their taste more from sugar than actual cacao , which is the source of this longtime superfood

new sources of food to meet the growing demand for organics in the United States , it \u2019 s becoming more likely that your organic food could come from China or other countries rather than U.S. farmers .\nAccording to a 2017 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 80 percent of organic food eaten in America was imported , with Turkey and China the two rising sources for organic food during the Obama administration , which increased spending for the USDA \u2019 s National Organic Program but also greatly supported the GMO food industry at the same time , and oversaw a decline in certified organic standards .\nGrowth of organic farming in the U.S. has increased in many ways , but the concern remains .\nConsidering the country \u2019 s overall level of pollution and shocking lack of standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a serious problem .\nHere are six reasons why : 1 .\nOrganic Products from China Can Contain an Unlimited Amount of Heavy Metals While certified organic does mean that the producer can not add pesticides , herbicides , heavy metals and other toxins when growing the produce , there are no rules about the outside environmental factors such as pollution .\nA farmer in China can use water with mercury or chemicals on the crops and keep the organic label .\nSince many parts of China have been experiencing extreme pollution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been buying canned air out of desperation ) , a lot of its water is heavily polluted .\nBut the lack of traceability in comparison to U.S. organic farms means you \u2019 ll have a hard time finding out any more information on how it was grown .\nChina accounts for half of all pesticide use in the world according to a 2020 report in The Conversation , hinting that pesticide drift on organic products is a concern .\nOver-application of fertilizer use in China , which uses four times more fertilizer per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could also be contaminating food products from the China according to the same article , which said that the practice could be causing additional chemical residues in food as well as nitrogen infiltration into groundwater .\nChina uses about 2.5 times the world average for chemical use per acre on its non-organic farms , even as China positions itself as a world leader in organic food production .\nLack of regulation has caused the country to experience record air pollution in Beijing , and studies have shown that at least 40 % of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90 % of groundwater , reported The Guardian in 2013 .\nThe water has been recorded as being so polluted that around that same time , an eyeglass-retailer executive dared a local environmental protection chief Bao Zhenming to swim in a river for 20 minutes for more than \u00a320,000 .\nBao declined .\nThis is the same water source that may be used to water the \u201c organic

berries were full of unsafe pesticides in past years .\nWhichever agency on the Chinese side approved the shipment was not following regulations .\nReports have also stated that numerous Chinese food growers may sometimes buy organic certification paperwork illegally and then grow foods in a non-organic way .\n4 .\nSupplements and Herbs from China Are Often Contaminated with Lead Because many herbs have detoxifying properties , they absorb heavy metals easily .\nIt has been tested , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contaminated with aluminum , and also contained arsenic , cadmium and lead .\nAlthough not organic , many conventional green tea companies have illegally used banned chemicals , as reported by Greenpeace .\nCan it happen to organic tea ?\n\u2013 It might , because organic

for years .\nAnd in 2011 USDA released evidence of a fraudulent organic certificate made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fake certification to pass non-organic soy , millet and buckwheat as organic , according to the Cornucopia , the nation \u2019 s farming watchdog .\nThe agency in charge of certifying organics in China is The Chinese Organic Certification Center ( COFCC ) .\nHowever there has been concern in the past of a lack of certification of its products , as many 30 % of products .\nThough organic products imported to the U.S. are supposed to be certified by a USDA certifier , there are not enough certifiers to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hiring third party certifiers in China .\nOn at least one occasion the certifier from China provided the paperwork but did not physically confirm that the organic food complied with the organic regulations .\nUntil more comprehensive regulations are enforced in China , and the country resolves its pollution problem , it might be wise to avoid food from China altogether , even if it has the \u201c organic \u201d stamp on it .\nBecause even if it was not forged , it might not mean a whole lot considering the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this adA Chinese

According to Dr. Berg , it doesn \u2019 t take much organic apple cider vinegar to see a big difference in terms of visceral body fat .\nDr. Berg explains in the video below that just one ounce of

"Throughout the course of our lives , we all face hardships that are unique to us , many of which we don \u2019 t share with many people .\nSometimes , these moments damage us to the point where we have a hard time seeing the silver lining .\nOther times , they provide us with an epiphany , an \u201c A-ha !\n\u201d moment we wouldn \u2019 t have experienced otherwise .\nAnd then there are moments , or situations that happen again , and again , and again until the lesson really sinks in .\nThese are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and illuminate our path forward in life .\nFor Dave Moore , a speaker , author , Navy , Coast Guard and Air Force pilot , those lessons came in the form of a series of incidents that no one could have ever predicted : four plane crashes , each of which taught him several difficult lessons \u2014 and ultimately forged him into the person he is today .\nRecently Moore , a dedicated aviator who has flown into hurricanes for the Coast Guard and lived to tell about it , decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trauma , seeing through the fog that it brings into our lives , and emerging stronger than ever , despite the scars we accumulate along the way .\nAHW : Hi Dave , thank you for joining us .\nWhat made you want to become a pilot at such a young age , and what was the most challenging part of getting started down that path ?\nDM : The easiest way to explain my desire for aviation at a young age was that aviation was in my blood .\nMy story is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military , but these passions are the catalyst that allowed me to uncover real life solutions to face seemingly insurmountable obstacles .\nAnyone who can uncover or find a purpose at a young age will achieve and accomplish well outside their \u2018 education \u2019 or \u2018 abilities \u2019 just knowing what they want .\nSo many people wander through life cloaked in mediocracy because they have not uncovered their passion .\nThe most challenging part of getting started , as the son of a postman , was finding the funds .\nI worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved my own money and paid for my passion .\nAt the time , airline jobs were hard to come by .\nMy dad would tell me that there were U.S. Air pilots working the French fry machine at McDonald \u2019 s , basically that I was wasting my time and money pursuing this .\nWhen you know what you want , you need to approach with laser-point focus and put blinders on to the naysayers , no matter who they are , and go for what you are trusting in your gut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What can you tell me about your first plane crash .\nWas it something you ever expected to happen ?\nWas it painful ?\nDid your life flash before your eyes ?\nDM : There is so much to say about the lessons learned from my first plane crash , it \u2019 s hard to write it all in this one article .\nI can tell you for certain , that I never in a million years thought something like this would happen to me .\nUnfortunately , there is a tremendous amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along that journey and my goal is to help others skip a decade or two of the dark fight to learning and overcoming these lessons , understanding the tools needed to combat and how to commit to leading yourself for the one life you are given and making it your best life .\nThe physical pain is obvious that I went through , but as the bones heal and the surgeon put my face back together to look better than before I crashed I have realized the fight had not even begun .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a mid-life crisis having to face my own mortality .\nNot something we usually consider at a young age , luckily I was young , strong and eager to fight to get right so I could accomplish my passion of aviation .\nThis drive is what brings me to you , as it gave me a no-fail option that I would uncover the secrets to healing post traumatic stress and turning it into what I call post-traumatic growth .\nThis , after many years of combating everything laid on me from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesson : I realized that you can break a bone , but nothing can break your soul unless you allow it .\nFor my life flashing before my eyes , I believe more than that happened .\nI believe I died that night and came back a completely new person .\nWhether it happened metaphorically , or in reality is insignificant because the change and what I discovered that could possibly help others makes this part of the story irrelevant .\nAHW : You managed to overcome your fear of flying again .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ crashes .\nLooking back , are you at all surprised about this ?\nDM : Yes !\nAfter two years out of the cockpit taking the initial time to get myself just to re-enter the cockpit , I probably would have not pursued aviation knowing what was to come .\nWhat a loss that would had been , knowing all the great adventures I have gotten to live , the amazing missions I have flown , the friendships I have made and the personal growth I have received by pursuing this passion ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage and proclaim that \u201c I always knew there would be a third one , but now I am all done.\n\u201d Since my fourth incident , it was the key to me re-understanding exactly what the first \u2018 C \u2019 of Uncrashable Leadership that I speak on is about : The crashes of life will come .\nAnd you have a lot less control than you think .\nSo even at this stage of tremendous growth in my life , I am still learning .\nIt just reinforces why I give my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help others overcome all obstacles they face in life , daily , not life and death but the battles of life we constantly need to face and fight .\nIt has given me the childlike excitement to wonder again what today will bring , live in expectation and passion knowing I have built myself so strong that whatever comes it will turn out for the good of Dave Moore , and nothing will crush my soul or my fighting spirit .\nAHW : How do people react when you tell them about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think were the mistakes that led to them happening ?\nDM : Most react in the same way , \u201c Loved your talk but don \u2019 t be offended if I ever get on an airplane , see you upfront and get off.\n\u201d I am a very safe pilot , believe it or not !\nA crew member who flew with me in the Coast Guard would say to me , \u201c Mr .\nMoore , if I am ever in a crash on the Falcon Jet I want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exciting situations outside of my crashes , and a fellow pilot down in Miami would say , \u201c if it \u2019 s going to happen , it will happen when Dave is in the cockpit.\n\u201d I found this to be a good thing , because my abilities and skills as an aviator I had mastered and are top notch .\nI was promoted to positions of authority over the pilot groups accordingly .\nThis leads us to your next question .\nLike a 3 year old who says \u201c it wasn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were really not me : 1st crash : Hit a deer on takeoff , at night never saw it and just as we were getting airborne .\nClassified by the NTSB ( National Transportation Safety Board ) as an Act of God .\n2nd crash : Refueling a C-130 ( a large transport aircraft used by the Air Force and Coast Guard ) on a training mission , the C-130 ran into the back of our KC-135 smashing the boom up into the aircraft and missed taking our tail off by a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety award by our unit for our response .\n3rd crash : Took a Honda Jet off the runway at Nashville international .\nThe manufacturer tried claiming it was all my fault , so I said okay and took full responsibility .\nThe FAA ( federal aviation administration ) investigated the accident and said , it \u201c takes a real man of integrity to step up and take responsibility like that .\nGuys like you just don \u2019 t run off the runway.\n\u201d It was a failed seal on a new aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel control box and that moisture would mess up the electronic impulse to the airplane and it would turn the nose hard left un-commanded .\nThe manufacturer has since hired new leadership in the shop and fixed the seal .\n4th crash : Nose wheel separated from the airplane after landing .\nThis only supports my 3 \u2018 Cs \u2019 of uncrushable leadership , we have little control over what life is going to throw at us today , we have all the control of how we handle the situation ; learn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally and professionally .\nAHW : Were there any turning point type of moments that led you to get back in the pilot \u2019 s seat again during your journey ?\nAnd if so , can you describe one of them to us ?\nDM : It took me : \u2022 None Two years to fly again after my first crash .\n\u2022 None Two weeks to fly again after my second crash .\n\u2022 None Two days to fly again after my third crash .\n\u2022 None Two seconds and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash .\nI actually wanted \u2018 selfies \u2019 at the plane after we knew there was no fire .\nThe largest first step of overcoming myself and my self-imposed limitations was after the first accident .\nCompletely paralyzed in fear , uncertainty and doubting if I was actually mentally handicapped , as who I was had changed so much it was no easy feat to continue on .\nAfter closing a successful , large sale working as an account executive , the excitement was short lived .\nI was driving down the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , \u201c Dave , what are you doing ?\nYou are a pilot and need to get back up in that sky !\n\u201d DM ( continued ) : I went out to a local flight school where I had originally started my training and earned my private pilot \u2019 s license .\nI was respected as a pilot before my crash , and was really good at what I did .\nThe results were not what I expected after two years .\nI actually rolled the simulator over and crashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I need to work on my mental challenges of overcoming myself , my proficiency as a pilot had been completely lost .\nGetting back in the saddle by completely focusing was paying off .\nI was getting good at my craft again , as I had my instructor license reinstated after passing my check ride again with an FAA designated examiner .\nI found myself working three times as hard as everyone else , because now instead of sitting back and \u2018 enjoying the ride , \u2019 I now said \u2018 what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenario .\nThis was an obvious fallout from my initial crash , realizing that all could change on a dime at no fault of your own .\nThe result : I was tired after every flight , but my knowledge base and expertise grew exponentially as my head was focused on every scenario and how I would handle it .\nThe twists and turns of life gave me a strong desire to enlist in the Coast Guard as a pilot .\nThe satisfaction of saving another human \u2019 s life , combined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school to compete against the best in the world would truly allow me to prove to myself I was not mentally handicapped and would force me to challenge and overcome myself .\nBeing accepted to Coast Guard OCS ( Officer Candidate School ) and earning a slot to go to Navy Flight school did just this .\nGraduating at the top of my class , I was probably the only student naval aviator competing against themselves rather than their peers .\nGraduation and being pinned with those Wings of Gold proved to myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of becoming an \u2018 Uncrashable Leader , \u2019 and that I was not mentally handicapped but fully capable of taking \u2018 new Dave \u2019 on a spin towards a better version of me .\nAHW : You have a system that helps people overcome their fears .\nCan you tell us a little bit about it , and maybe one or two practical ways people can start down that path to conquering their own fears ?\nDM : I have created the three C \u2019 s of Uncrashable Leadership : \u2022 None The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How to Combat the Crashes I am able to condense 30 years of gained knowledge and help others use these tools in their own lives to accomplish what they desire .\nI have personally used

grown in labs has been a hot topic of conversation for the last seven years , with some media outlets hailing it as the future of food and a \u201c cleaner \u201d way to do meat .\nBut when the real thing hits supermarket shelves , will customers be kept in the dark about how it \u2019 s really made , and perhaps more importantly , will anybody actually want to eat it ?\nReady or not , lab-grown meat from stem cells is on its way , and it \u2019 s being propped up by one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetically modified food ( GMOs ) \u2014 Microsoft founder and long-time Monsanto supporter Bill Gates , along with another wealthy investor , Sir Richard Branson , founder of the Virgin Group .\nIn recent years , the two famous figures placed a big-time bet on the self-proclaimed \u201c clean \u201d lab-grown meat company Memphis Meats , to the tune of $ 17 million .\nBut will customers flock to this new so-called \u201c murder free \u201d meat , or are Gates and Branson making a mistake in betting on a an under-tested technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human health ?\nStartup Companies to Grow Meat in the Lab Memphis Meats and Hampton Creek ( recently accused of labeling lies with its other products aimed at reducing animal agriculture ) are the most commonly-heard of , but not the only companies who are working on creating lab-grown meat .\nMosaMeat of the Netherlands , founded by Professor Mark Post , first started with a product with a $ 325,000 price tag .\nSince then , \u201c cultured meat \u201d has become much more affordable \u2014 but has continued to avoid conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not , and whether consumers will know if they have been made with GMO ingredients or not .\nAnother company is SuperMeat in Israel .\nAlso founded by a professor , its goal is to create lab-grown chicken meat .\nThe company raised $ 229,269 on Indiegogo to begin its efforts .\nThese companies are just the tip of the iceberg for what industry insiders hope becomes the new standard for meat eaters everywhere .\nAll of the lab-grown meat companies have a similar mission , as evidenced by these slogans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn \u2019 t require raising and slaughtering animals.\n\u201d \u2013 Memphis Meats ( now known as Upside Foods ) \u2022 \u201c Let \u2019 s change the way meat gets to the plate.\n\u201d \u2013 Memphis Meats Besides their pledge to save animals , lab-grown meat companies make big claims when it comes to helping the environment .\nUpside Foods says they expect the following results from their products : \u2022 An up to 90 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional meat \u2022 The same reduction of land and water use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food crisis and combat climate change , but doesn \u2019 t say much about animal welfare .\nTheir main technique requires one sample of muscle cells to be taken from live animals for every 20,000 tons of lab-grown meat , saying the biopsy is harmless and noting that the animal survives the procedure .\nSuperMeat promises to be humane , eco-friendly , to fight world hunger , and to create meat that is supposedly healthier and cheaper .\nHow the meat is actually grown , however , is another story entirely ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem eager to reveal to future customers ) .\nWhile a humane , environmentally friendly and even \u201c healthy \u201d burger sounds like a dream come true for meat lovers , there are plenty of misconceptions here that the public is being kept in the dark about .\nThe first issue with lab-grown meat is how the meat cells are being harvested .\nSlate recently reported that most lab-grown beef comes from a surprising , and highly unappetizing source \u2014 fetal bovine serum ( also known as FBS ) .\nWhat happens is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slaughterhouse is pregnant , when she is slaughtered , the fetus is removed and brought into a blood collection facility .\nWhile still alive , the fetus is drained of its blood until it dies by a process of sticking a needle in its heart .\nIt takes about five minutes , and this is what produces FBS , and ultimately , these so-called healthier burgers .\nEven though cows and bulls are kept separately , the percentage of dairy cows who are pregnant is between 17 and 31 percent .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaughtered is in the millions .\nThe FBS from these slaughtered fetuses can then be used in the lab , grown in a petri dish into a meat-like substance by feeding the cells nutrients for about a month .\nFetal bovine serum is the easiest to grow , because cells when separated from the body are suicidal .\nThe FBS contains growth factors that prevent them from killing themselves .\nThis process is not the only way to make lab-grown meat , but it is the fastest way .\nIt can be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , and may be added to a petri dish with chicken cells to create a similar product .\nAt the end of the day , this reliance on FBS means some animals are still being killed for lab-created meat ; cultured meat is definitely not vegetarian as some may hope .\nThe ethical question of killing animals still remains : is slaughtering fetuses to make this highly unnatural product really any better than killing adult farm animals ?\nThe controversial FBS is also used in creating vaccines for people , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 billion chance of contracting mad cow disease .\nThis low risk is much higher in cultured meat , which is why the Food and Drug Administration discouraged its use for the past 25 years ( before wealthy investors like Gates and Branson decided to bring it to the forefront of the food industry , that is ) .\nIs Lab Grown Meat Really A Better Choice ?\nWhat will the cultured meat companies do , and can Gates and Branson steer clear of the controversy that is sure to arise when people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made ( much like genetically modified organisms from Monsanto ) ?\nEach company ends up hiding its true plans because their products have to be licensed , and there are plenty of proprietary issues that come into play .\nIt seems that they are trying to avoid FBS , but there are no conclusions to be drawn yet .\nHampton Creek says they will try to create meat using plant-based products to make the cells grow using bioreactors or giant tanks , using a process that will look similar to beer brewing .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ first product without FBS , and are now working on applying it further .\nThey are now focusing on lab-grown chicken made from chicken cells , and have had Sir Richard Branson in to test their lab grown products .\nIt seems as if these companies are all about their image and reputation rather than being fully transparent with their processes , as shown by the vague nature of their new website .\nCultured meat companies are oftentimes mum about the processes they are using .\nThere \u2019 s a strong chance these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least according to a representative from the company Finless Fish as quoted by Gizmodo .\nThe environmental claims made by lab grown meat companies may not be what they seem , either .\nHampton Creek for example says its lab-meat will be up to ten times more environmentally efficient than conventional meat , but the evidence is lacking .\nA 2011 study concluded that this type of meat product might produce less greenhouse gas , yet that it uses the same amount of energy as the pork industry .\nAnother 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same amount of energy as the conventional meat industry .\nDespite the controversies , It seems that many animal rights groups are supporting lab-grown meat .\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) offered a one-million dollar prize to the first company who can produce a commercially successful cultured meat .\nHowever , the deadline of the contest has passed as commercial lab-grown meat is still in the works .\nIt seems that company gave up on inspiring everyone to cut out animal products and is willing to compromise .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is produced through cellular agriculture instead of slaughter.\n\u201d It might not be much better for the environment after all .\nMeanwhile , the consumers are being fed an eerily-hypnotizing ads to hype up our expectations .\nAmerica \u2019 s biggest meat corporation is also jumping on the bandwagon : The Future Is Here : Vegans Can Now Eat a Plant Burger That \u201c Bleeds.\n\u201d But

scientists recently made a startling discovery \u2013 that one particular , obscure type of honey is capable of killing just about everything scientists throw at it , including some of the worst bacteria known to man .\nThe findings were published in the European Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases ( June 2009 edition ) , and could hold special significance at a time when

honey , which she said she began using after having her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand ambassador for the Manuka Doctor skincare line .\n\u201c After I had ( her son ) Mason , I stopped taking medicine\u2014I just changed my lifestyle and felt like I wanted the most natural things that I could find and so I became really into Manuka honey.\n\u201d It \u2019 s easy to see why now that the secret is out about this honey \u2019 s incredible health benefits , and it doesn \u2019 t take a celebrity to see the biggest reason why .\nManuka honey is created by bees foraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Zealand manuka bush , as well as tea trees native only to Australia and New Zealand .\nIn the aforementioned studies , Australian researchers found that the honey killed every bacteria or pathogen it was tested on , according to a report by The Australian .\nThe honey can be applied topically to help fight against infections of the skin , cuts and insect bites , or taken internally .\nThe most exciting difference with the manuka honey that was tested is that none of superbugs killed by the honey were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common problem with today \u2019 s antibiotics .\n\u201c New antibiotics tend to have short shelf lives , as the bacteria they attack quickly become resistant , \u201d said Dr. Dee Carter of the University of Sydney \u2019 s School of Molecular and Microbial Biosciences .\n\u201c Many large pharmaceutical companies have abandoned antibiotic production because of the difficulty of recovering costs .\nDeveloping effective alternatives could therefore save many

in health food stores and online , although the supply levels have fluctuated in recent years and fake honey scams have been documented .\nWhen looking for manuka honey it is best to look for one that

user JoshuaOne9 on Amazon .\nThankfully , I had already done the research so I knew exactly what to do .\nAs soon as I saw the red bump ( thinking the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I scratched it , but the second day I realized that it had to be something else .\nMy husband immediately knew what it was since we had been dealing with our friend \u2019 s case of MRSA .\nI got my hands on this Manuka honey and put on the area of skin that was affected and then it is very important that you cover it with a bandaid .\nWithin hours I felt relief and within a few days it was completely gone\u2026 While

and well known as the largest producer of cherries in the United States .\nFarmers in the nearby Leelanau Peninsula sell their crop everywhere from roadside farm stands to stores and markets across the U.S. , but not all of it ends up being used .\nAccording to one frustrated Traverse City farmer , a little known government marketing program is essentially forcing cherry farmers to dump huge portions of their crop , leaving it to rot in the sun \u2014 ultimately making way for imports from other countries to be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santucci farm shared the news on July 30 of this year in a Facebook post that went viral , garnering nearly 67,000 shares .\n\u201c These cherries are beautiful !\nBut , we have to dump 14 % of our tart cherry crop on the ground to rot .\nWhy ?\nSo we can allow the import of 200 million pounds of cherries from overseas !\nIt just doesn \u2019 t seem right\u2026 \u201d Santucci continued in the Facebook post aimed at unleashing his frustrations , and raising awareness about an agreement imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he believes is outdated and harmful .\n\u201c What do you think ?\nPlease share this on your Facebook page ?\n?\n?\n.\nJust to let everyone know we are not allowed to donate or in any way use diverted cherries , \u201d he continued on the Facebook post .\n\u201c I have people who would buy them if I could sell them.\n\u201d The type of cherries grown , and left to rot by Santucci because of the rule , are tart cherries , which have a \u201c very short shelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth of them each year , but a marketing order passed in 1937 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as part of the Agricultural Agreement Act imposes limitations on how much can be sold in order to make way for imports , which led to the wasting of a large portion of his cherry crop .\nThe act is a \u201c vain attempt to prop up the price of cherries , \u201d Santucci said to the Detroit Free Press in this article .\nPerry Hedin of the Cherry Industry Administrative Board in DeWitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherry growers have been paid better prices over the past 20 years because of the order , which was opted into by tart cherry growers and processors in 1995 .\nThe stated goal of the rule is to add stability to what can be unpredictable yields crop from year-to-year for cherry growers .\nBut when it comes to independent , smaller-to-medium scale cherry farmers like Santucci who don \u2019 t have processing equipment , the rule can be a serious hindrance .\nUnlike other growers , Santucci doesn \u2019 t have the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cherry concentrate , or other products with a longer shelf life .\nAnd even if he could , the cherry board is still keeping \u201c millions of pounds \u201d of cherry concentrate off the market that could be sold , in order to make way for imports , he said .\nSantucci says he has no choice but to leave their crops to rot , because he can \u2019 t process them and access to facilities that can is limited .\nThe order is voted on every five years by cherry producers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with access to their own processing equipment benefit from it and continue to vote for it , to the detriment of smaller farmers .\nMeanwhile , Santucci and many other cherry farmers are likely to continue losing market share to imports from areas like Turkey and Eastern Europe .\nHe can \u2019 t sell them , and he says that growers are not allowed to donate them to food pantries or shelters , either .\nThe CIAB sends out people to make sure they are left out to rot in order to enforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to sell these excess cherries for less , I might not make that much more , \u201d Santucci said .\n\u201c But if we \u2019 re ever going to stop the increase in imports , we \u2019 ve got to compete with them head to head on every cherry we produce .\nIf we don \u2019 t do that , we \u2019 re leaving the market wide open to them.\n\u201d The cherries that are diverted can not be sold or given away , Santucci said in a Facebook post in response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes the cherry board will consider alternatives to the rule and perhaps that Congress will take up the issue .\n\u201c Dropping cherries on the ground isn \u2019 t going to change \u201d the increasing low-cost cherry import dynamic , \u201c and will probably only encourage it , \u201d he said .\nHe added in a Facebook post that he \u2019 s not trying to keep out all imports , and that farmers do receive a small payment for the cherries that they are forced to dump .\nHe says he doesn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to see an end to the whole program , and encouraged people to write Congress asking for a change .\n\u201c I posted ( the photo ) because I want people to know that we sometimes do stupid things in this country in attempt to do the right thing \u2014 we end up doing the wrong thing , \u201d Santucci said to UpNorthLive.com .\n\u201c Unless we can make the people who count understand and know what \u2019 s going on , we \u2019 ll never change it.\n\u201d In response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing program and Santucci \u2019 s post , Paul W. Jackson , editor of Michigan Farm News , wrote this editorial piece addressing what he believes to be misconceptions surrounding the issue .\nHe reiterated through Kevin Robson , horticulture specialist with Michigan Farm Bureau , that the program is established by a majority vote of tart cherry growers .\nreport this ad \u201c It \u2019 s also enforced by the growers themselves , \u201d he said .\n\u201c It is for the betterment of the industry as a whole , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even those who voted against it.\n\u201d Robson included a historical example of how prices remain stable because of the order .\n\u201c In 1988 , when the entity was called the Cherry Administrative Board , growers voted to eliminate the marketing order .\nPrices began to follow a rollercoaster that led , within 10 years , to tart cherry prices that fell into single figures .\nSome growers went out of business.\n\u201d Robson also said that Santucci \u2019 s assertion that the cherries can not be donated is untrue .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ growers like Santucci who don \u2019 t have access to processing facilities would be difficult .\n\u201c Farmers can use the cherries for research and development , and they could make thousands of cherry pies and donate them to charity if they want , \u201d Robson said .\n\u201c Remember these are tart cherries .\nThey need to be processed \u2014 and quickly \u2014 to make a viable product .\nThey aren \u2019 t sweets that you just eat by the handful.\n\u201d Robson added that the cherry processors make the decision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dumping does not occur directly because of the marketing order itself .\nBut for all the people who \u2019 ve seen the Facebook posting of thousands of pounds of perfectly good cherries going to waste , the emotional

natural side effect to this imbalanced approach the U.S. has when it comes to health .\nAs an herbalist I have actively conducted case studies with adaptogens to advance herbal sciences .\nI \u2019 ve seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce stress and improve immunity , which resulted in improved health in the midst of many ailments many considered life-long and incurable .\nI attributed these results to the phytonutrients inside of the herbs working like or better than medicine .\nIt wasn \u2019 t until a couple years of practicing the herbal arts and continuing to work with other more experienced herbalists that I realized that herbs are not designed to be medications for sickness .\nAHW : Can you talk a bit about your charitable efforts and why they \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Our goal is to really bring the whole process full circle .\nYou see nowadays the idea of monocropping and industrialized farming gaining steam and is really corporatizing our food supply .\nSo moving forward we are

, and not against her , we give ourselves a chance to leave the world a happier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With that in mind , we are working to source our ingredients from independent farmers who understand this , and share their farming practices with the world , giving them the recognition they deserve .\nOn the back end , a portion of the profits will go directly back to the farms we source from , so

see below ) : AHW : Hi Dr. Platt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you realize that adrenaline dominance and the stress response played such a huge role in our health ?\nWas there a \u201c lightbulb \u201d moment for you ?\nMP : It was not until 2008 that I became aware of how adrenaline in excess had a significant impact on a person \u2019 s health .\nIt initially revolved around ADHD , which is all about adrenaline , and progressed to other conditions associated with excess adrenaline .\nThere was no \u201c ah-ha \u201d moment , just a series of observations with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : What made you decide to write the book \u2018 Adrenaline Dominance ?\n\u2019 MP : For many years , my goal has been to change healthcare in this country .\nMy first attempt was with my book \u2018 The Miracle of Bio-identical Hormones.\n\u2019 This book brought thousands of patients to my office from all over the country and all over the world .\nIt is the number one hormone book in Germany , a country that appears to have a lot more interest in exploring new methods of wellness .\nMy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write a manual to teach doctors about hormone therapy .\nIt is called \u2018 The Platt Protocol for Hormone Balancing \u2019 and provides a lot more useful information than doctors can receive at medical conferences .\nIt provides the only information in the medical literature to tell doctors how to eliminate problems related to excess adrenaline in their patients .\nHowever , getting doctors to accept ideas that are not provided by drug companies is a tough sell .\nIt has occurred to me that if healthcare is to change , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be because of patients who get angry enough to demand change and who start questioning their physicians as well as a medical system that has little interest in their being healthy .\nThis is the primary reason for my new book , \u2018 Adrenaline Dominance.\n\u2019 AHW : It seems like this is a problem many naturopathic doctors have attempted to tackle but still seem a bit baffled by at times .\nIs there a point that you think a lot of people are missing or is it more a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands ?\nMP : You are correct about naturopaths being baffled .\nThey are the ones who focus on a condition called \u2018 adrenal fatigue \u2019 .\nIt is a classic example of why it is so important when dealing with hormone therapy to treat the patient , rather than their lab tests .\nThis condition resulted from the presence of low cortisol levels in morning specimens of saliva .\nSaliva tests can be exceedingly inaccurate , especially in people with high adrenaline levels .\nAdrenaline , as part of the fight-or-flight response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body not needed for survival .\nThis results in cold hands and feet , IBS , tinnitus , and a cutoff of circulation to the salivary glands causing a significant disruption of hormones in the saliva .\nAll the symptoms of \u2018 adrenal fatigue \u2019 are actually those of adrenaline dominance .\nAnd yes , definitely , people have to be proactive about their health .\n\u2018 Adrenaline Dominance \u2019 provides not only insight as to why people can put out excess adrenaline even when there is no perceived danger .\nit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adrenaline , and it provides the knowledge of how to successfully lower adrenaline levels using an approach not requiring the intervention of a doctor .\nIt literally puts a patient \u2019 s healthcare in their own hands .\nAHW : A lot of authors and doctors seem to claim that there is one main cause of ill health whether it be inflammation , too much sugar , etc .\nWhat makes the stress response in particular such a key issue for the natural health community to focus on ?\nMP : The stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevated sugar levels .\nStress is the number one cause of cancer and heart disease .\nIt shortens telomeres , again shortening the life span .\nAdrenaline , the number one cause of stress , is responsible for more conditions felt to be incurable than any other factor .\nAHW : If you had to pick 5 foods that help with the stress response the best what would they be and why ?\nMP : I will start with the two most helpful and then add some others : Coconut oil ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best fuels because they produce ketone bodies \u2013 the best fuel for the brain .\nThe second best are green vegetables , which represent the best sugar for the brain .\nYellow vegetables , black beans , oatmeal , brown rice , and sweet potatoes or yams ( are also great for supporting nourishing the adrenals ) .\nAHW : Anything people should know about your book in particular ?\nThank you for joining us !\nMP : It is not hard to get patients well \u2013 you just need to treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not well .\nThis book empowers people to eliminate conditions felt to be incurable \u2013 fibromyalgia , interstitial cystitis , PMDD , bipolar disorders , depression , anxiety , etc .\nHormones run in families , and all families have members that have excess adrenaline .\nThe book is divided into the good , the bad , and the ugly factors associated with excess adrenaline .\nThe good part of adrenaline is ADHD , and most people ( and all doctors and schools ) do not realize it is all about adrenaline .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is not a learning disorder .\nAnother important aspect about the book is that there is a strong likelihood that the most common cause of excess weight can actually be attributed to excess adrenaline .\nAs a result of this , many people are actually gaining weight while they are sleeping .\nThanks for

.\nThey contain a positive or negative charge , and bond quickly with water molecules .\nThese properties allow them to be distributed evenly through the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minerals also help to maintain a consistent , evenly distributed electrical charge across cell membranes , which increases the latent energy potential of each cell .\nThis type of minerals may also help improve proper cellular function by acting as a catalyst for the naturally found enzymes within each cell .\nEnzymes allow the cell to perform its specific job or jobs , resulting in a healthy , full functioning human organism .\nWithout enough minerals , and perhaps more specifically enough properly absorbed minerals , the process remains dormant , and health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature may arise .\nSome of the top

Webster Kehr of the Independent Cancer Research Foundation , \u201c The FDA , NIH , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are their puppets.\n\u201d 3 .\nOur Medical Community Ignores the Power of Plant Medicine and Calls It \u2018 Pseudoscience \u2019 Pharmaceutical companies have set out to discredit holistic treatments \u2014 especially in areas with the highest drug profits , such as cancer , heart disease , psychiatric disorders , and allergies , even though they are widely used in other countries and steeped in tradition .\nD rug companies use the term \u201c scientific evidence \u201d as a political definition to control the FDA and the National Institutes of Health .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They pay doctors and psychiatrists to speak on their behalf and offer expensive trips and steep payments .\nThey block financial contributions using terms like \u201c unproven treatments , \u201d and many \u201c charitable organizations \u201d are entirely controlled along with Congress .\n4 .\nThe Biggest Corporate Sponsors of the American Academy of Pediatrics Are Pharma Companies The Academy of Pediatrics was created in 1930 as an \u201c independent \u201d forum for the health and well-being of our children .\nToday , corporate Friends of Children Fund members include Pfizer , Sanofi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Merck , GlaxoSmithKline , Johnson & Johnson , etc .\nA conflict of interest ?\nHave our doctors been bought ?\nI believe so .\n5 .\nConventional Doctors Tend to Address Only One Organ at a Time One of the fundamental flaws of our existing medical paradigm is the tendency to approach health and sickness only through a disease-based or single organ-focused lens .\nWe treat the body as a machine with separate parts , assign a diagnosis label , and match it with a corresponding pharmaceutical .\nIn reality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web of biochemistry .\nTherefore , we need more medical doctors who understand that we must start to treat the \u201c whole body \u201d like holistic and functional doctors do .\n6 .\nOur Genetics Is Not the End of Our Story Just because ADHD , depression , or even autoimmune issues \u00adrun in the family does not mean that is our fate .\nWe have more control over it than the medical industry wants us to believe .\nWe may start with a genetic vulnerability ; however , we need to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruct our genes on how to express themselves .\nThe foods we eat or don \u2019 t eat , the nutrients we take or don \u2019 t take , our stress levels , our sleep habits , and our exposure to toxins determine our gene expression .\n7 .\nMost Doctors Know Very Little About Nutrition Most disease is preventable and related to nutrition , yet doctors today do not know the science of how healthy food heals the body .\nNor do they see the impact \u201c fake \u201d food , pesticides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health .\nAccording to The American Journal of Clinician Nutrition , most graduating medical students rate their nutrition preparation as inadequate .\nAccording to Michael Greger , M.D .\nFACLM , a physician and internationally recognized professional speaker on some important public health issues , medical students are still getting fewer than 20 hours of nutrition education over four years .\nEven most of that has limited clinical relevance .\nYou can not get health from a pill .\nWhen referred to a specialist like a gastroenterologist , endocrinologist , rheumatologist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they rarely discuss healing foods , detoxification , and other modalities that heal the body .\nInstead , they prescribe drugs , namely immunosuppressants or steroid therapy , to mask symptoms \u2014 never getting to the root cause of any illness or healing any disease .\nAnd these medications often do more harm than good .\n9 .\nInsurance Companies Do Not Cover Important Treatments and Therapies Health insurers can limit coverage they deem experimental or not medically necessary , and they often do .\nMany consider \u201c alternative \u201d interventions medically necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectiveness in the peer-reviewed published medical literature supports it .\nI find this funny , weighing more than 100,000 people die each year from complications caused by prescription drugs .\nAnd thousands more die of drug overdoses after getting hooked on prescription pain medication .\nBut , again , money and politics are why insurance won \u2019 t cover safer alternatives .\nThe more services they exclude from coverage while still selling policies to patients , the better for their bottom lines .\n10 .\nHealthcare Today Puts Band-Aids On Splinters Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods are beneficial for treating acute , life-threatening health issues .\nHowever , these approaches do not consider the complex communication between the body \u2019 s various systems for more nuanced disorders .\nAs a result , they can ultimately lead to a breakdown in communication followed by a loss of function .\nOften the side effects of these treatments can be as harmful and worse than the original symptom itself .\nEastern medicine modalities are ancient systems of healthcare that take into account all of the biological systems of the whole body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body \u2019 s natural capacity to heal itself , leading to healing on a much deeper level .\nCalling for a Shift in Our Mental Health Paradigm Although many parents claim that psychotropic medication has improved their child \u2019 s life , we must not forget that giving a six-year-old medicine does nothing to improve the conditions that derail their development in the first place .\nPolicymakers have all but called off the search for a better understanding of the conditions \u2014 even though these medications often cause many short-term and long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all parents everywhere to let love guide them to explore all available options rather than simply settling for what conventional specialists suggest .\nIt isn \u2019 t enough to be alive .\nThe quality of life is also essential .\nWe need more due diligence in our healthcare system .\nWe need an \u201c Integrative Medicine \u201d approach , a healing-oriented medicine that takes the whole person ( body , mind , and spirit ) into account \u2014 including all aspects of lifestyle .\nWe must emphasize the therapeutic relationship and use all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a medical system that neither rejects traditional medicine nor accepts alternative therapies uncritically .\nGood medicine should be based on sound science , inquiry-driven , and open to new paradigms .\nWe must use natural , effective , and less invasive interventions whenever possible .\nWe need a system that promotes the prevention of illness as well as the treatment of disease .\nWe need to wake up and make a stand for real change .\nWe can no longer put a price tag on our physical and mental health .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our children is a high price to pay for

actually believe it)", "content": "Popular international magazine New Scientist found itself in the midst of an intense controversy ( of the social media variety , that is ) after publishing an article titled \u2018 Stop buying organic food if really want to save the planet , \u2019 along with a video that was viewed more millions of times on Facebook .\nViewers were caught off guard by the video \u2019 s defiant and authoritative tone \u2014 and many of them fired back in the comments section , defending organic food from what they saw as an unwarranted and misguided attack .\nAt a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and supporters of organic agriculture truly believe they \u2019 re making a positive difference , the video , barely over a minute long and devoid of sources ( except for the link to a short companion article in the comments section and accessible only by creating an account with the website ) , came as a shock to many .\nSo , do the claims of New Scientist really hold water ?\nOr are supporters of organic food being unfairly demonized ?\nLet \u2019 s examine further .\nBut first , check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the fuss is about : Video Claim # 1 : \u201c Farming is the 2nd Largest Source of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Worldwide \u201d and \u201c Organic Food Results On Average in Higher Greenhouse Gas Emissions Than Conventional Farming \u201d The second source of global greenhouse gas emissions ( after electricity and heat production ) falls under the category of agriculture , forestry , and other land use ( a total of 24 % of all emissions ) .\nThis is a large group combining different sources of gas emissions together that needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to fully understand its complexity .\nThe biggest source is enteric fermentation , accounting for 40 % of total emissions in this category .\nIt is a process of emitting methane gas produced in digestive systems of ruminants , grazing animals such as cattle , sheep , and goats .\nEnteric fermentation also takes place in non-ruminant animals but to a lesser extent .\nThe data shows that large-scale animal agriculture in general , is greatly responsible for greenhouse gas emissions .\nA total of 18 % of greenhouse emissions ( more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture , which makes switching to a more plant-based diet one of the best things you can to help curb these emissions .\nAfter animal farming , other sources of greenhouse gas emissions are manure left on pasture ( 16 % ) , synthetic fertilizers ( 13 % ) , rice cultivation ( 10 % ) , and manure management ( 7 % ) .\nUnfortunately , the video doesn \u2019 t address what \u2019 s actually causing these emissions , misleading people into thinking growers of organic crops are solely to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers plenty of solutions that aren \u2019 t being utilized .\nFertilizers : How Organic Can Flip the Script Manure is used primarily on organic crops , and perhaps one of the biggest issues organic farming can still improve upon ( large amounts of it could be eliminated if animal agriculture was reduced and people ate less animal products ) .\nThere are other organic fertilizers that can be used , however , such as a combination of different mixtures of plant compost , rotation crops such as legumes , and mineral treatments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others .\nBesides organic fertilizers , organic agriculture also is far more likely to utilize crop rotation , a system of planting crops in a specific order , which feeds the needed nutrients into each next crop and lessens the need for synthetic fertilizers .\nA recent study by Stanford researchers found that planting legumes as part of a crop rotation can act as a natural fertilizer , reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers that cause emissions as well as environmentally devastating algal blooms and oxygen-depleted \u201c dead zones \u201d through farm runoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the untapped potential of an organic farming approach .\nWhile organic farming is often seen as a monolithic system , there are plenty of other branches that are capable of tackling problems , using other symbiotic techniques including crop rotations .\nOne such system is biodynamics , a holistic technique that follows the natural rhythms of the planet and creates a balanced ecosystem for the crops to get the nutrients they need naturally .\nPermaculture is another system of integrating all parts of the environment to work together , allowing crops to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe system has been used most effectively in Cuba since the 1990s and created a food revolution for the country , a dynamic growing system that flows in a natural rhythm similar to how food grows in the wild .\nAnother proposed solution is regenerative agriculture , which utilizes grazing animals in traditional ways while growing food .\nWhile it does leave manure on pasture , supporters say that this type of agriculture can help sequester carbon in the soil and bring carbon net emissions back into balanced and safe levels .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , the true abilities of these systems are not being adequately studied or supported .\nMost top agricultural universities are fully on board the GMO and agrochemical train because of how profitable it is , due to multi-million dollar corporate donations ( learn more here ) .\nAnd most media sources ( like New Scientist , for example ) are too busy promoting and defending these industries to even notice the potential of organic .\nAs for government funding of conventional vs. organic , it \u2019 s not even close to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sustainable Agriculture Coalition , the amount of research being allocated to organic and holistic farming techniques is still merely \u201c a tiny fraction of the over $ 2.8 billion annual federal investment in food and agriculture research.\n\u201d Perhaps it \u2019 s time to move in a different direction ?\nThe next large category of farming emissions is rice cultivation .\nAnd in some studies , organic rice has been shown to produce more gases than conventional rice , but it strongly depends on how that rice is grown .\nIn India , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need GMO rice or synthetic chemicals to grow a large harvest .\nSumar Kumar and his family grew an incredible 22.4 tons of rice from one hectare of land in 2013 , sparking a rice revolution in India .\nInstead of planting old rice seeds in clumps , the family used System of Root Intensification ( SRI ) , which can also be used on wheat , potatoes , sugar cane , yams , and many other crops .\nUsing this system requires only half the seeds usually needed , and maximizes yields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seeds , then transplanting them as seedlings into the field one-by-one with enough space in between allowing roots to get air .\nThe system works on the premise that \u201c less is more.\n\u201d Whether using SRI system or other methods , a study from Spain has shown that for many other crops besides rice , many other crops emit fewer gases when grown organically , such as cereals , legumes , open-air and greenhouse gardening .\nOrganic agriculture has a lot of tools to grow the harvest even more with less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regenerative farming , permaculture , SRI and many other systems are capable of leading the way to the future .\nAs a whole , organic has been shown to be better not only for human health but also better for the environment .\nAnd as you \u2019 ll see shortly , farmers in developing countries are producing more on less land despite having far less resources than the monoculture , corporate-driven agriculture you \u2019 ll find in the United States .\nLet \u2019 s look at other claims New Scientist brings up .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ farms , we do see how organic farmers , such as the aforementioned Kumar in India , can overcome that obstacles with ingenuity , experience , and knowledge of their land and tools .\nUrban farming is yet another untapped system that has great promise , even in harsh conditions .\nWill Allen , a former professional basketball player based out of the projects of Milwaukee , has been spotlighted in several outlets including the The New York Times .\nAllen works out of the Growing Power center , where he grows enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Allen famously claimed he grew a million pounds on three acres .\nWhile the exact numbers have been disputed , Allen has clearly demonstrated the power of growing food indoors using a thriving , closed-loop ecosystem that incorporates aquaponics , complementary plant and animal life , and much more .\nWhile it is true that there are studies showing greater yields per acre for conventional farms , others actually show far more potential for organic crops , particularly in places where food security is low .\nOne study from the Research Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic farms were 20 percent less productive than conventional over a 21-year period .\nHowever others show a much smaller gap , or improved yields from organics .\nBill Liebhardt , an agricultural scientist from the University of California-Davis , found that U.S. organic corn yields were 94 percent of conventional yields , wheat was 97 percent , and soybean 94 percent .\nOrganic tomatoes showed no yield difference .\nStill other studies have shown results that most people would never believe possible from organic farmers .\nBut they oftentimes don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the perception that organic farming is unsophisticated or archaic .\nMany farmers in the developing world are shattering yield records , as noted in this article : More evidence from India also shows the potential of organic farming : a seven-year study from Maikaal District in central India showed yields as much as 20 percent higher for several organic crops .\nAnd an international study from University of Michigan researchers found that organic farming yielded less in developed nations , but actually yielded more in developing ones .\nIn both cases they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world .\n\u201c We were all surprised by what we found , \u201d said Catherine Badgley , one of the Michigan study \u2019 s lead researchers and a paleoecologist .\nThe study was based on a local farmer \u2019 s experience growing an incredible 27 tons of vegetables on just six-tenths of a hectare during a short growing season in the Great Lakes State .\nIt inspired the team to look for as many comparisons between organic and non-organic yields as possible , and 293 were uncovered in total .\nThe team ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional farms in the developed world , and yield ratios of organic farms in the developing world , to the entire planet .\nEven when the more conservative organic yield model ( from the developed world ) was applied to the rest of the world , it still produced significantly more food than is necessary per person per day .\nApplying the second model showed a huge benefit to going organic : Badgley said that concerns about clearing wild areas , such as the tropical forest shown in the New Scientist video , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those areas are mostly cleared to make way for cattle farms and GE soy to feed them ) .\nA holistic , organic approach , if done right , combines the beauty of a diverse natural world with the production of the world \u2019 s top farms .\nStudies routinely shower greater biodiversity for organic farms .\n\u201c If we simply try to maintain biodiversity in islands around the world , we will lose most of it , \u201d Badgley said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very important to make areas between those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those areas being pesticide-drenched fields is just going to be a disaster for biodiversity , especially in the tropics .\nThe world would be able to sustain high levels of biodiversity much better if we could change agriculture on a large scale.\n\u201d Small Scale Natural Farming Can Feed the World and Respond to Climate Change In 2013 , the United Nations said that small-scale organic farming is the best way to \u201c feed the world \u201d and protect the environment in its report \u2018 Wake Up Before It \u2019 s Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farming as an untapped resource .\n\u201c What is called for is a better understanding of the multi-functionality of agriculture , its pivotal importance for pro-poor rural development and the significant role it can play in dealing with resource scarcities and in mitigating and adapting to climate change , \u201d the report said .\n\u201c Questionably , priority in international policy discussions remains heavily focused on increasing industrial agricultural production , mostly under the slogan \u201c growing more food at less cost to the environment.\n\u201d Overall , the message was clear : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farms to assure that we produce enough food to feed the world , or to protect the environment .\nWe need to change the system from the ground up .\nVideo Claim # 3 : \u201c The Most Promising Technology for Reducing Farming Emissions is Genetic Modification \u201d The New Scientist video says that \u201c The Most Promising Technology for Reducing Farming Emissions is Genetic Modification , \u201d adding that \u201c GM Crops Are Being Developed to Capture More of the Sun \u2019 s Energy and Require Less Fertilizer.\n\u201d But the video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short article that is only readable after registering for the site , and that article \u2019 s source for its claims on GMOs is a November 4 article titled \u2018 Trials Planned for GM Superwheat That Boosts Harvests By 20 % .\n\u2019 The article mentions a new genetically engineered \u201c superwheat \u201d that is said to increase the effects of photosynthesis , having the potential to \u201c boost yields by 15 to 20 percent.\n\u201d But it still hasn \u2019 t even been approved for field trials in the UK , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown .\nOne of the \u201c superwheat \u201d crop \u2019 s researchers , Malcolm Hawkesford , admitted that new strains would have to be developed in the future and it \u2019 s anyone \u2019 s guess as to whether they will perform the same in the field \u2014 the crops are \u201c a long way off , \u201d as the New Scientist article \u2019 s author Michael La Page put it \u2014 a message that clearly doesn \u2019 t come close to backing up the boasts of the controversial video .\n\u201c It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot in a greenhouse , \u201d Hawkesford said .\n\u201c But in the real environment , you often don \u2019 t see the same response.\n\u201d And once again , no long-term safety or environmental testing for this new GMO crop has been conducted .\nGenetically engineered crops have a history of causing environmental damage , as admitted by the USDA .\nAnd while the \u201c superwheat \u201d crop comes with big claims , GMO companies have a long history of making bold claims with results that simply don \u2019 t measure up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 2016 New York Times investigation titled \u2018 Doubts About the

@ The Energy Whisperer , \u2019 joined AltHealthWorks.com for an email-based interview on his business , its progression , healthcare in Europe vs. the United States , the intersection between health and technology , and much more .\nThe interview can be read below : AHW : You have a background as an engineer and you \u2019 ve spent time in the tech industry .\nHow did you get started in holistic health and with this company ?\nI had burnout from a multitasking career as a producer-entrepreneur-consultant about 20 years ago , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as immune suppression and chronic symptoms .\nThe modern healthcare system could not help me , and I had to learn from scratch how to take care of my body and energy with natural methods to get back into my prime .\nWhat I discovered were paradigm-shifting truths about health and wellbeing .\nAHW : Your company has worked with healthcare practitioners in Germany , Switzerland and Austria .\nWhat are some of the biggest differences in how they handle healthcare over in Europe compared with the U.S. ?\nWhat are some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JW : As far as the mainstream healthcare system is concerned , I see no huge differences .\nThe approach and philosophy are the same .\nWhen treating chronic disease , they focus on symptom management rather than discovering and addressing root casualties .\nIn Germany , an older alternative medicinal culture remains quite hidden due to regulatory reasons but is getting more attention now that the latest pandemic measures have been a disappointment .\nGermany also has an incredibly powerful history in natural treatments .\nThe literature before the world wars in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with incredible insights into treating chronic issues from a root causative perspective .\nAHW : Can you give us a cliff notes version of what Vital Field products are and how they work ?\nIs this something people can begin wearing on their own or do they need a prescription , doctor \u2019 s recommendation or anything ?\nJW : FrequenCell products , like the Energy Cells , are classified as health and wellness products , so they don \u2019 t compete or classify with medical alternatives .\nThey are entirely non-chemical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shelf life of up to two years .\nTheir principle is based on subtle vibrations , electromagnetic frequencies that regulate cell communication in a way that helps damaged or stressed areas regenerate faster .\nThe principle boils down to cell coherence and its ability to help the body distribute energy and information where it most needs it .\nAHW : How did the idea for Vital Field products come about ?\nAnd is it something that has been widely adopted thus far in Europe or the United States ?\nJW : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s , used by some of the top alternative clinics in Europe , but it \u2019 s historically been a word-of-mouth game , where only a select clientele has a chance to use these methods .\nThese are machines that are expensive and heavy .\nWe changed this in 2020 when we brought out the first end-user solutions with cost-efficient and wearable solutions , with full return rights should the product not work for your particular condition .\nThis year , in 2022 , we are going global with this offering and introducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AHW : Have you used these devices recently and if so what does it feel like when you use them ?\nWhat would you like prospective customers to know about how they can help ?\nJW : I live with these solutions and use them daily .\nThey were also part of my own healing process .\nI recommend them to everyone who has not been able to find satisfactory solutions from pills or prescriptions or who is interested in 100 % non-chemical , safe alternatives without side effects .\nFrequency applications are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are the future .\nAHW : Anything else you \u2019 d like to share with the audience ?\nJW : It \u2019 s important to find your own individual approach to maintaining your optimal health .\nWe rely on too many off-the-shelf , one-size-fits-all type of solutions .\nFrequency applications take into account our individual energetic profile , which is an important step in the right direction .\nThanks to Jan for joining us , and thank you for reading !\nI have been using the No Pain and Pineal Gland cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More info can be found on Vital

many things considered to be \u201c healthy \u201d by big , mainstream corporations and only includes many of the best organic and non-GMO ingredients , something I tasted first-hand .\nAccording to Illea , she and her company attempted hundreds of different recipes before decided on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available .\nThe ones I tried are as follows : Chocolate- This bar is made with dates , egg white powder , almonds , cacao , salt , and the company \u2019 s signature , functional organic mushroom blend that includes Chaga , Lion \u2019 s Mane , Cordyceps , Reishi , Turkey Tail , Shiitake , and Tremella .\nOverall I really liked this flavor .\nThe dates blended in more than standing out and added a delightful sweetness to the recipe .\nI couldn \u2019 t really taste the mushrooms .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ superfood bar .\nThe size is a little smaller than most other organic nutrition bars I have tried but the bars are surprisingly filling at 190 calories each .\nThe chocolate bar has 11 grams of protein , more than the next flavor on this list .\nI really enjoyed how each flavor has a different nutritional profile instead of being created from one cookie-cutter mold designed to meet nutrition macros .\nThese bars have five grams of protein and are flavored with strawberries .\nThe dates and the strawberries combined well in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I distinctly remember craving ice cream

nutrition and flavor , I wolfed this one down so fast I don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I definitely loved it .\nI am a sucker for coffee-flavored ice cream , desserts ( tiramisu is my favorite ) , and protein/nutrition bars , and this one lived up to my expectations .\nThe coffee flavor is savory and rich and there are 11 grams of protein with 1000 milligrams of organic mushroom extracts in these bars .\nI could see myself taking these on a hike or camping trip and enjoying every bite even more thoroughly than I did in my kitchen while trying these for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mushroom bars from AktivBar here After trying this flavor , there was no doubt in my mind : AktivBar has hit a home run with these nutrition bars .\nreport this adNot many companies are able to create sweet and savory products that both taste amazing and are packed with nutrition , but AktivBar has both styles down pat .\nThis particular bar is incredibly delicious and fragrant .\nYou can find it in the AktivBar seven-bar sampler pack by clicking here .\nAll things considered , these bars are a work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone seeking to live an active lifestyle .\nThe flavors are incredible and the nutrition is excellent .\nThe one caveat is that not every single ingredient is organic , but most of the ingredients are organic including the brilliant functional mushroom blend in each and every bar .\nAs someone who \u2019 s been taking mushrooms seriously for a long time lately , I can see the value these bars bring to the table .\nConsistently eating organic mushrooms like the ones found in these bars will increase your immunity tremendously while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cognitive function like nothing else on the market .\nIf you \u2019 re someone who \u2019 s an athlete , hiker , or

are gluten and dairy free , non-GMO , and have been specifically designed to lower LDL ( low-density lipoprotein ) cholesterol .\nRecently , Dr. Klodas sat down to answer questions from AltHealthWorks.com on the mission behind her products , the best practical steps people can take to improve heart health , and much more .\nAHW : What are some of the best heart-healthy nutrients in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Step One \u2019 s foods were specifically formulated to deliver clinically impactful levels of fiber , omega 3 fatty acids , antioxidants and plant sterols in just two servings per day .\nAll of these nutrients come from whole real food ingredients ( such as oats , walnuts , berries and chia ) , the only fortification being plant sterols as meaningful amounts of these are difficult to obtain in just two servings of plant-based foods .\nAll the foods are interchangeable in terms of nutrients of interest so individuals can choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same nutritional benefits .\nThis nutrient combination , as derived from the specific ingredients in Step One Foods , has been demonstrated \u2013 in a randomized controlled clinical trial \u2013 to yield highly significant , rapid cholesterol reductions .\nSome trial participants experienced medication-level cholesterol responses in just 30 days .\nWith food .\nNot with drugs .\nWith food .\nAHW : What are some of the best , most practical steps that people can take to improve their heart health today from a dietary perspective ?\nEK : If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today from a dietary perspective , the most efficient way to improve nutritional quality and help lower cholesterol would be through using Step One Foods !\nAfter all , that \u2019 s why those products were developed \u2013 and they \u2019 re super simple to incorporate intoanyone \u2019 s routine .\nFor more do-it-yourselfers , increasing intake of whole plant-based foods is the key .\nThere is something special about plants .\nPer calorie , they can \u2019 t be beat for nutrient content , especially when it comes to vitamins and minerals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt \u2019 s the fuel our bodies need .\nThe more plant based your diet the better .\nBut remember , it \u2019 s not just plants in any form .\nA potato chip is a plant-based food .\nIt \u2019 s about plants in their most whole and unadulterated forms .\nAHW : What do you say to the people who are pro certain types of saturated fat such as butter and grass fed animal protein ?\nDo you think that this approach is correct for long-term health and longevity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of foods too often ?\nJust asking because it seems as if there are two camps of people : one who believes the American Heart Association is 100 percent correct and the other who believe that saturated fat has been unfairly demonized .\nI was wondering if you have ever taken note of this perspective and if you have any thoughts on it .\nEK : When it comes to food or food components , I think both quality and quantity matters .\nSaturated fats can raise LDL ( bad ) cholesterol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts we eat makes sense .\nBut you also have to pay attention to the quality of the nutrient source .\nThe fat present in grass-fed free-range cows raised without hormones and antibiotics will be less damaging than fat from cows raised under industrial farming practices .\nBut that doesn \u2019 t mean you get to eat a 16 oz grass fed steak and feel like that has no consequences !\nSame for unsaturated fats \u2013 just because they \u2019 re liquid at room temperature and come from plant-based sources ( and carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being anti-inflammatory ) doesn \u2019 t make them automatically good for us .\nSome oils are highly processed and refined ( like corn oil and vegetable oil ) and might contain processing contaminants .\nYou are best off consuming unsaturated fats as close to their original form as possible \u2013 so cold pressed extra virgin single source olive oil , avocados , raw nuts , and wild caught fish .\nreport this adIn the end , the best dietary advice I \u2019 ve ever run across comes from Michael Pollan \u2013 \u2018 Eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants.\n\u2019 By \u201c eat food \u201d he means real , whole food that \u2019 s minimally processed and as close to its original form as possible .\nFood that our great grandmothers would recognize as food .\n\u201c Not too much \u201d \u2013 means don \u2019 t stuff yourself and watch your portions \u2013 especially when it comes to less health promoting foods .\nI eat butter .\nJust not too much .\nAHW : Can you talk about the best lifestyle and exercise-related ways to live as healthy as possible from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 4 main lifestyle factors that contribute to not only heart health but also healthy longevity .\nIn addition to diet , as outlined above , the 3 others are : 1 .\nDaily moderate exercise .\nYou should move your body every day .\nYou don \u2019 t have to be a marathon runner or triathlete .\nBut you still have to get out there and do SOMETHING .\nIt could be gardening , or yoga or a physically demanding job .\nIdeally , you should move your body somewhat vigorously for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n2 .\nSocial interconnectedness .\nIt \u2019 s important to be part of a group and be an active member of that group .\nIt could be your neighborhood , your faith community , your extended family , your group of friends .\nWe are social animals .\nWe thrive when we experience meaningful human connections .\n3 .\nAn inner sense of purpose and joy .\nFinding and nurturing a pursuit that gives you personal satisfaction and contentment reduces stress which has wide ranging benefits .\nThat pursuit could be reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it could be your work , it could be meditation or a hobby or learning something new .\nIt \u2019 s whatever gives you a reason to get up in the morning .\nMy Experience With Step One Foods For the purposes of this review I was given the chance to try products from Step One Foods .\nAs someone who likes to hike and play sports I really enjoyed the nutrition bars , of which I tried the chocolate and cranberry .\nThe chocolate has a nice crunchy texture to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiking and playing basketball .\nThe cranberry bars also were light and filling but not too filling .\nI consumed them before a three hour kayaking trip to Turnip Rock in Port Austin , Michigan .\nThe Anytime Sprinkle product is another one that I enjoyed because it is packed full of healthy fats and nutrition and I liked how I could sprinkle it on my cereal or in a bowl that I made with black currants similar to an acai bowl .\nOverall , these foods are well worth checking out if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , delicious and healthy .\nI would have liked to have had an organic version , but I love that these foods are non-GMO and contain a lot of healthy foods like walnuts , blueberries , and even the rare Saskatoon berries .\nMore information can be found by

quick online search for the term \u201c climate change \u201d reveals an onslaught of news on the topic , most of it focusing on emissions and the shift away from \u201c carbon-based fossil-fuel energy projects.\n\u201d What the mainstream media refuses to focus on , however , is the solution staring them right in the face : the shift in agricultural policy from GMOs and pesticide-intensive monoculture to the worldwide change that would net the biggest positive impact : a return to organic , regenerative agriculture , which the UN pushed for in its landmark 2013 report \u2018 Wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 Regenerative agriculture is not only highly productive and chemical-free , it also helps to replenish the vitally important , lost layers of topsoil that have recently gone missing from farms across the United States , which can help stave off droughts , sequestering both water and carbon , while provide more nourishing , mineral , and antioxidant-rich food .\nWhile the potential of organic , regenerative agriculture has gone mostly unrealized in recent decades , there \u2019 s at least one major obstacle standing in the way of its implementation : corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Gates , the latter of which is now the largest owner of farmland in the United States .\nNative American Author Takes \u201c Farmer Bill \u201d Gates to Task Over Lack of Farming Knowledge As a professor in the American Studies Department at the University of New Mexico , co-founder of The Red Nation ( an Indigenous resistance organization ) , citizen of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe , and author of several books , Nick Estes knows a thing or two about land ownership , and what he \u2019 s seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Gates becoming the largest owner of private land in the United States does not sit well with him , to say the least .\n\u201c Gates has been buying land like it \u2019 s going out of style , \u201d Estes wrote in a wide-ranging letter to Gates published by The Guardian .\n\u201c He now owns more farmland than my entire Native American nation.\n\u201d While the collective wealth of the world \u2019 s billionaires rose a whopping 54 % since the beginning of the coronavirus situation in March 2020 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % ) , Estes is focused on an entirely different kind of wealth , namely the power that comes with land ownership .\nGates has a long history of pushing genetically engineered crops and pesticides on farmers in third world countries , while supporting the same system here .\nMuch like his positioning as an expert on the coronavirus in the mainstream media , Gates is out of his element yet again , Estes said .\n\u201c Bill Gates has never been a farmer , \u201d Estes notes in the article .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him \u2018 Farmer Bill \u2019 this year ?\n\u201c The third richest man on the planet doesn \u2019 t have a green thumb .\nNor does he put in the back-breaking labor humble people do to grow our food and who get far less praise for it.\n\u201d Gates currently owns about 242,000 acres of farmland with more than $ 690 million in assets , Estes notes in The Guardian .\n\u201c To put that in perspective , that \u2019 s nearly the size of Hong Kong , and twice the acreage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I \u2019 m an enrolled member , \u201d Estes said .\n\u201c A white man owns more farmland than my entire Native American nation

continues to rise , Gates and the world \u2019 s ruling class continue to push for GMOs and Roundup-drenched crops .\nBecause of the lack of organic farmland , the United States actually imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its organic products , while refusing to adjust and continuing to poison its land , air , water , and soil .\n\u201c The United States is defined by the excesses of its ruling class .\nBut why do a handful of people own so much land ?\n\u201d Estes asks in the letter .\n\u201c Land is power , land is wealth , and more importantly , land is about race and class.\n\u201d Estes cited an example of billionaire Ted Turner , who currently owns two million acres and has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herd .\n\u201c Those animals , which are sacred to my people and were nearly hunted to extinction by settlers , are preserved today on nearly 200,000 acres of Turner \u2019 s ranchland within the boundaries of the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty territory in the western half of what is now the state of South Dakota , land that was once guaranteed by the U.S. government to be a \u2018 permanent home \u2019 for Lakota people.\n\u201d Estes said that small farmers are far more careful with the land ,

low T affects 10-40 % of all men worldwide .\nIn men , testosterone is far too important to ignore .\nLow testosterone levels may change a man \u2019 s body , energy and health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTestosterone is thought to regulate the following functions in men : Testosterone production generally drops over time , as does the production of estradiol , a form of estrogen found in men that is essential for a healthy libido , erectile function , and spermatogenesis ( the production and development of sperm ) .\nA drop in estradiol may also affect a man \u2019 s testosterone levels over

implement them in your life : Exercise is a given when it comes to improving our health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , but what most people fail to implement are specific types of exercises that are the most effective for this important purpose .\nThe first is HIIT , or high-intensity interval training .\nHigh-intensity interval training is similar to regular running , either on the treadmill or out in the open , in that the same basic motion is performed .\nIn this case , the intensity is ratcheted up more than a few notches over the course of the exercise .\nHigh-intensity interval training typically starts out with walking , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dial is turned up , so to speak , to a more intense sprinting motion .\nHigh-intensity interval training \u2019 s goal is to engage all systems of the body and to add a healthy form of stress to your workout routine while challenging the body , instead of letting it get comfortable by moving at the same speed for several minutes or longer .\nreport this adA typical HIIT session may include a 30-second jog followed by a 30-second run .\nThis engages all systems of the body , boosts testosterone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise .\nIncreased physical activity has been found to be more beneficial than calorie restriction for increasing testosterone levels , and resistance training such as weightlifting at the gym is one of the best ways to improve testosterone in the short term .\nWeight training also increases a person \u2019 s resting metabolic rate in the long-term , which prevents fat storage and increases testosterone levels in over time as well .\n2 .\nEat a Balanced Diet with the Right Building Blocks- There \u2019 s an old saying that abs are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely the case with testosterone in many cases as well .\nEating foods like cookies , cakes , pies , candy and similar items may take an immense toll on your production of healthy hormones like testosterone over time , especially if you live a sedentary

testosterone .\nProtein is especially important , as it has been strongly linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could actually decrease your T levels , so make sure you \u2019 re eating enough foods like avocados , nuts and seeds , fatty , wild caught fish and yes , even grass-fed butter and coconut oil as well .\nTestosterone supplements aren \u2019 t as noticeable as things like Vitamin C or Vitamin D at the health food store , but they can make an immense difference in your testosterone levels when taken consistently .\nSome of the best testosterone boosters include adaptogenic compounds , herbs and nutrients that aren \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diets .\nKorean ginseng for example has been shown to increase testosterone along with several different markers of male health and male reproductive health .\nOther herbs and vitamin compounds act as estrogen blockers , helping to improve testosterone levels in the body .\nThis class of estrogen blockers includes ashwagandha root , vitamin K2 ,

of grain \u201d simply because of all of the unsavory things that we \u2019 ve done to our bread in the name of profit ?\nMichael Pollan , author of the best-selling books \u2018 In Defense of Food , \u2019 \u2018 Cooked : A Natural History of Transformation \u2019 and others , has said before that getting more whole grains in our diet is the number one thing Americans can do to improve their

Vani Hari , aka the Food Babe , which resulted in a PR nightmare and a pledge to remove them .\nMany majority of all supermarket breads still likely contain this highly controversial chemical , however , and that \u2019 s just the tip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DATEM , sodium stearoyl lactylate , ammonium chloride , monoglycerides , diglycerides and others have all been linked to health problems of

remove as many anti-nutrients as possible and to make it more suitable for consumption .\nMany of the world \u2019 s longest living cultures use these processes , as detailed in the book \u2019 50 @ @

?\nReally ?\n\u201d - A large percentage of the breads on store shelves also contain unnecessary genetically engineered ingredients such as soybean oil , canola oil , beet sugar ( this is labeled

finding a permanent home on store shelves , ironically enough .\nLet \u2019 s all make it happen and vote with our dollars from now on .\nReal Bread Alternatives You Can Try Ideally , there would be a

deep breathing is paramount for digestive health .\nDeep breathing places the body in a parasympathetic state , which means it is mostly stress-free .\nThis allows the digestive system to relax and better do its job .\nPraying before a meal , meditating , practicing yoga , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or walking barefoot and many other practices help with deep breathing .\nDr. Cole recommends inhaling through
