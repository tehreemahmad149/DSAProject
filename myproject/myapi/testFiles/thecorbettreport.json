''\nI think it was number 74 , but don \u2019 t hold me to that [ *CORRECTION : Where Can We Run To ?\n- Questions For Corbett # 072 ] .\nAnyway , you can find it on my site where I address that question .\nBecause I get that question a lot from people at least a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : `` I want to move .\nWhere should I\u2026 What country should I move to ? ''\nI can not and will not answer that question for anyone because it \u2019 s such a personal question dependent on a thousand different personal context sort of things .\nSo , for some people , I \u2019 m sure Mexico is a great place to go .\nFor others , I \u2019 m sure it is not .\nAnd I wouldn \u2019 t presume to say either way .\nFor me personally , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that when I got to Japan , and was planning to stay here for one year , I \u2019 ve stayed here for 18 years ?\nWhat is it about Japan that drew me to it and I felt comfortable ?\nAt this point , I feel more at home in Japan than I would in Canada .\nSo why is that ?\nI don \u2019 t know .\nThat \u2019 s a million different personal things that go into that .\nBut people always ask me : `` Why did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if it was some sort of big political decision that I made or some sort of calculation or strategic thing .\nNo , I was young , dumb , single , carefree , was just looking for a way to kill a year and make some money .\nSo : `` I \u2019 ll go teach English in Asia ! ''\nAnd it turns out I really liked it in Japan .\nThat \u2019 s the long and short of it .\nAs it turns out , that was actually , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of ways .\nOne of which is that because I was not fluent Japanese speaker in Japan at in early 2000s .\nMy lifeline , the sort of the thing that I was getting information and news and things from was online .\nAnd so , I was a very early adopter of podcasts and what have you , because it was just a very easy way for me to stay in touch with what was going on back home in Canada .\nAnd as a result of that , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things like podcasting and other things , which helped me out in the long run .\nAnd , also , I think it is easier to do this work that I do from a remove .\nI talk a lot about Canada and the US and other places .\nBut it \u2019 s good to have that actual distance , so I can sort of see things from afar and get a different perspective on them .\nYeah .\nMy story is the same .\nI thought I \u2019 d go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI became a Mexican .\nI \u2019 ve been here for 10 years and even Mexicans ask me , why \u2019 d you come here ?\nAnd I \u2019 m like , \u201c I \u2019 m still trying to figure out the question\u2026 the answer to that question , \u201d so that \u2019 s just life .\nYou know , life happens .\nAnd as you say , I agree when people ask me , should I go to Russia or Mexico or Latin America ?\nAnd I often tell them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put where you are .\nSo I wanted to get your thoughts on what \u2019 s most pressing you at the moment ?\nThere \u2019 s a lot of questions I can ask you .\nAnd often I ask my guests , what \u2019 s on your mind right now ?\nI cover a lot of top topics , but I \u2019 ve kind of gotten tired of the geopolitical war talk with this , US , Russia , cycle at the moment .\nAnd I kind of view it as a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great reset and all that it entails is my number one worry , at the moment .\nThat includes this cyber pandemic and all of this stuff that you and I and listeners know about .\nI \u2019 m kind of disregarding all of this talk of the restrictions being canceled .\nMany of the articles that I \u2019 m reading , in fact they say , \u201c Oh , we \u2019 re getting rid of the restrictions \u201d , but they still outline that the COVID passports are here to stay .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ already operating , they \u2019 re already talk about expanding them .\nSo now they \u2019 re attempting to install this global social credit system , which went in place will basically turn off my ability to do anything .\nI don \u2019 t think I \u2019 m exaggerating that it will literally starve me and my family to death .\nThat \u2019 s kind of my worry , that \u2019 s on my radar .\nWhat \u2019 s what are some of the things on your radar at the moment ?\nWell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much in line with that COVID-1984 has as much to do with a virus as Watergate had to do with a hotel , which is to say nothing .\nIt \u2019 s not about that .\nAnd so whatever happens in terms of this pandemic that we \u2019 re living through right now , it doesn \u2019 t matter .\nThe infrastructure for the biosecurity state is being laid , has already to some extent , been laid and will not be pride out without some major revolutionary times to come .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , at least for this particular moment and what we \u2019 re living through right now .\nAnd I have always , and will always cite one of the writers and thinkers that helped me to not understand this , but to articulate it .\nIt was Giorgio Agamben , who was the one from whom I got that term biosecurity and he formulated it very simply , very precisely in a very early on .\nAnd I think he definitely saw where this was going from a very early stage .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about Giorgio Agamben , he wrote a\u2026 He \u2019 s an Italian philosopher .\nHe \u2019 s written about states of emergency and how they are used to override constitutions and other things , which basically , I think shows that the political , the governance paradigm that we live under is not really what we think it is and can change at a moment \u2019 s notice as we have seen .\nAnd he \u2019 s really articulated what this is and where it \u2019 s going , and the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the planet .\nFor example , when he did an interview in May of 2020 , so very early on called polemos epidemios , where he said : And it goes on to say : Well , that \u2019 s a pretty good articulation of what \u2019 s happened over the past couple of years .\nAnd , as I say this , this has nothing to do with the particularities of this particular moment .\nAnd people who have followed my work for any length of time , hopefully know by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Medical Martial Law over a decade ago , precisely because the legislative institutional groundwork for this has been laid over the past couple of decades at the very least .\nSo this particular thing is being used as the moment : `` OK , let \u2019 s pull the trigger on this . ''\nBut the gun was already loaded and ready to go .\nAnd it didn \u2019 t take a crystal ball to see where this was going .\nThis is the new governance paradigm for the planet , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along .\nWe went from the homeland security state of the early two thousands into the biosecurity state without missing a beat .\nAnd there are a number of parallels there .\nAnd I did a piece in 2020 on September 11th , I released COVID-911 , where I specifically drew those parallels between homeland security and biosecurity .\nAnd you can look at some very specific examples .\nI believe it was the clear health pass was something that was started in\u2026 or 2002 , 2003 , something like that as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the homeland security state and screening for terrorism and what have you .\nAnd that company has effortlessly switched over to , well , now they \u2019 re going to be providing the health check screening passports that now won \u2019 t just be at the airports .\nNow it \u2019 s moving out into your everyday life .\nAnd exactly , as you say , it \u2019 s creating the infrastructure for a state where they can turn your ability to participate in society on or off with a flick of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see coming is , in the very near term , yes , all of this vaccine , health passport is just the fig leaf for the implementation of the digital ID system , which will then be used and forwarded through social credit scores and the central bank digital currency , which is what I see as the midterm in the next five years .\nWe are going to start seeing the implementations of CBDCs in various countries , which will be directly controlled by central banks .\nThey will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want to impose limits , for example , we want\u2026 we need to quarantine this city .\nSo your CBDC wallet will no longer work if you leave the city and we have your GPS , because it \u2019 s on your smartphone .\nSo we know where you are .\nWe know who you \u2019 re transacting with .\nWe know what you \u2019 re buying at every moment that you \u2019 re buying it , we can allow or disallow that transaction .\nThat is the nightmare in the midterm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , within the next decade , I do see hot war geopolitical war as a very real possibility .\nYeah .\nI had a similar view , actually I had Agamben \u2019 s book on my wish list .\nNow I \u2019 m going to get it that you mentioned it .\nAnd I think about a year ago , I think I was one of the first to interview , Robin Monotti , the architect ; and he was mentioning , Italian architect and he was mentioning Agamben .\nBut I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re seeing goes back even way further like a century .\nI interviewed the Jewish historian , Edwin Black , where he talks about the algorithm ghetto .\nAnd on his show just two weeks ago , the topic was how in 1938 , the Governor of Connecticut , Eugenicist had drawn up plans to actually take people .\nThey deemed as undesirables , send them to extermination camps in the Ozarks .\nWe \u2019 re talking about Connecticut in the United States in 1938 .\nSo he lost reelection , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he was influenced by the Nazis who were in turn influenced earlier by the American Eugenicist .\nSo it seems like what they \u2019 re trying to do now , they \u2019 ve been trying to do this for a century .\nAnd it \u2019 s insane , and as you say , a lot of people say , I \u2019 m too pessimistic or cynical , but I don \u2019 t see this going away like we \u2019 re in it .\nThey \u2019 re laying the infrastructure .\nThere \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I \u2019 m just kind of like bating down the hatches and kind of preparing for the worst .\nIt \u2019 s just\u2026 I mean , what are your thoughts going forward ?\nYes , I agree .\nWe should not be taking this lightly .\nAs we \u2019 re recording this , I wrote an editorial just the past weekend called `` Do NOT Go Back to Sleep !\nThis is NOT the End ! ''\nbecause I see the same sort of rhetoric going around , people celebrating : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the restrictions ! ''\nYes , OK , let \u2019 s be happy about the steps that are being taken in the right direction , but we may be winning certain battles .\nWe are not winning this war , not by a long shot .\nNot yet .\nSo there \u2019 s a lot more work to be done .\nOn that note that you mentioned about the historical context for this and stepping back and looking at the bigger , bigger picture of where this is coming from and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s extremely important to be able to understand that this is not just the happenstance incompetent boobs , bumbling their way through a response to this thing that came up , oh , what are we going to do ?\nNow , this is part and parcel of a plan that is in line with an ideology that has been pervasive at the very least demonstrably for over a century now .\nAnd I tried to tie that history to get other in my , How & Why Big Oil Conquered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see is the early iteration of this philosophy ideology guiding principles of the oligarchs was framed around the concept of eugenics .\nThe pseudoscience of eugenics that developed in the late 19th century in England , but quickly spread to the United States and then to Germany , etcetera .\nBut , of course , after World War II , when all of that , well , it \u2019 s\u2026 we can \u2019 t really claim to be eugenicist anymore .\nIt \u2019 s kind of got a dark .\nWe don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo we have to take an underground .\nAnd the American Eugenics Society and others explicitly said , we need start crypto eugenics .\nYou had Julian Huxley , the founder of UNESCO writing in the founding document of UNESCO .\nWe need to make eugenic policies thinkable again , all of this .\nWell , how do we do that ?\nWell , you have people like Julian Huxley and others who come together in organizations like the World Wildlife Federation .\nWhat a wonderful thing ?\nYay !\nAll these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in conservatorship , kind of organizations , World Wildlife Federation , these sorts of things that are just about protecting nature .\nAnd then we get the next iteration of the eugenics ideas , which was reformulated as population control to save the planet and population control in every sense , not just in terms of numbers and controlling fertility and sterility and what have you .\nBut also controlling the population and what they can do and what they \u2019 re allowed to do .\nAnd that starts to go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way of restricting people \u2019 s ability to access various parts of nature .\nAnd eventually , of course , who can own and what will we do with this nature .\nAnd that \u2019 s culminating , as I was reporting late last year in this Global Financial Alliance for Net Zero , which came about at the top 26 in Scotland .\nWhere they \u2019 re talking about , `` Oh , we \u2019 re going to form these new natural asset classes , which will then be traded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such investment companies !\nAnd we \u2019 re going to have these billionaires stewarding over the world \u2019 s natural resources in the name of saving mother earth , of course . ''\nAnd where I see this going long term is into the next iteration of the same idea , the fundamental idea of eugenics , which for people who don \u2019 t know , look it up , but essentially the idea that there are certain people who are genetically fit to rule over others , they are genetically superior and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future .\nThe genes of the poor and the criminals and the mentally defective , they need to be removed from the gene pool .\nThat \u2019 s essentially what we \u2019 re talking about .\nIt \u2019 s just a justification for ruling class ideology , but the long term , the next stage of that is going to be transhumanism .\nAnd that sounds absolutely crazy to the average person as it should , but don \u2019 t talk to me or to the average person talk to Klaus Schwab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourth industrial revolution , talking about the merging of our digital , biological and physical identities , the brain chips , and all these crazy ideas that , again , it \u2019 s not James Corbett who 's talking about it .\nIt \u2019 s Klaus Schwab and his cronies talking about these ideas that are coming that will be tied into the central bank digital currencies and the digital IDs and the social credit scores and the vaccine passports .\n.\n.\nwhich , for some reason , they \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after country .\nI wonder if there \u2019 s some carbon credits that are coming in the future .\nYou \u2019 ll have a carbon allowance that you \u2019 ll be allowed to spend each month , which ties into technocracy , which is an entire other idea , which ties very nicely into the eugenic story that I \u2019 m painting here .\nWhere , literally , it was a plan to structure the economy , not around dollars and cents or pesos or yen , but around jewels of energy .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of energy each month by the technocratic rulers of the technique who rule over you .\nAnd they will allow you to spend a certain amount of energy each month .\nSo products and services that you buy will be priced in units of energy .\nAnd this will all be balanced by the scientists and engineers who know best for you .\nAgain , all of this fits together .\nAnd to anyone who doesn \u2019 t understand or doesn \u2019 t know any part of what I just talked about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diarrhead all over the place for the last couple of minutes .\nBut when you start to know all of the pieces of that puzzle and how they fit together , it is absolutely breathtaking .\nAnd that is the reason why people like yourself know that whatever little rollbacks we \u2019 re getting on this or that mandate here and there is not the end of this battle .\nYeah .\nI just saw recently someone I interviewed some months ago , the Australian Senator Malcolm Roberts , he \u2019 s going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been weekly now talking about this Australian Digital Identity Bill .\nAnd basically using the same language as you , he \u2019 s saying that they want to put our all aspects of our lives to make it a subscription service to them .\nAs you laid out every single aspect of our lives , and I don \u2019 t know how important this is .\nHow would you qualify this system ?\nFor me , it \u2019 s not that important .\nIt \u2019 s ultimately total .\nIt \u2019 s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have total control , the financial aspect , money and power .\nBut we hear , you \u2019 ve mentioned biosecurity states , technocracies , some people call this Marxist , monopoly , capitalist , transhumanist .\nIt seems to be like this beast that \u2019 s got flavors of each , how would you kind of qualify it ?\nYes .\nIn a sense , perhaps trying to put the definitive single label on it is self-defeating , precisely because it can morph and change shape to suit whatever the etiology of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that hundreds or thousands of years ago , people believed that their rulers were either literally gods or appointed by God to rule over them .\nThat doesn \u2019 t fly in the modern , enlightened , scientific era .\nSo they needed to come up with a news story .\nOkay .\nIt \u2019 s genes , actually , when eugenetics started , they didn \u2019 t even know about genetics per se .\nMendel was still doing his pea pod experiments and stuff .\nSo they didn \u2019 t really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey just called it germplasm .\nAnd said , \u201c Well , our germplasm , our goo is better than your goo .\nAnd this is the scientific way of doing this.\n\u201d So they will morph and change the narrative to suit whatever timeframe they happen to be in .\nAnd I think the one for the coming decades is going to be technocracy .\nIt \u2019 s going to be , don \u2019 t worry guys , the scientists trust the science .\nThey know what \u2019 s best , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know everything .\nWhere do the people in the white lab coats get their funding and resources ?\nAnd no , never ever think about that question .\nNo , it \u2019 s just , they \u2019 re floating on clouds and they will tell you what to do .\nAnd I think that \u2019 s going to be the fig leaf of justification for this in the coming years .\nSo I think , for example , Patrick Wood has it nailed .\nI think this is technocracy as the governance paradigm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the coming decades .\nAnd that \u2019 s going to dictate the way that this unfolds and it \u2019 s a nightmare , unless we are aware of this and consciously working towards .\n.\n.\nAnd I wouldn \u2019 t even say `` fighting against '' the implementation of the system so much as building up the actual alternative to this system .\nBecause their entire system is going to be predicated on being able to control and monitor and disallow any interaction or any transaction with any person in real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to build up the alternative infrastructure for an alternative economy now .\nWe should have been doing it 20 , 50 , a hundred years ago .\nBut , hey , might as well start today .\nAnd if we don \u2019 t have that in place by the time this CBDC and all of these things are in place , it will be game over for free humanity .\nYeah .\nI talked to Patrick about a month ago .\nAnd on this podcast , we often talk about parallel structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit about Mr .\nGlobal .\nThen there \u2019 s a lot of smart people that I interview .\nAnd as you said earlier , when you listen to my podcast , people have to get it through their head that I don \u2019 t necessarily agree with my guests , but you got to hear different points of views and a comment .\nA listener was telling me like , \u201c Everyone \u2019 s got a little piece of the puzzle that maybe you didn \u2019 t think about before.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like recently I had on Ron Unz , who thinks that COVID was a US bio weapon launched against China .\nRight before that , I spoke to Jeff Nyquist who thinks it \u2019 s a Chinese-Russian bio weapon launched against the US and the west .\nAnd then before that I had the Dutch academic Kees Van Der Pijl , who wrote the fantastic book States of Emergency .\nAnd I agree with him where we \u2019 re seeing\u2026 Other people that I \u2019 ve talked to , like Michael Rectenwald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same that we \u2019 re seeing factions of ruling elites or ruling elites in all nations .\nThey have some sort of a global network where they \u2019 re working together , because how else can you explain all nations from Mexico to Kazakhstan , where I used to live , to everywhere , applying the same measures .\nAnd so , I mean , what are your thoughts on\u2026 what do you think is going on ?\nIs there this one global power structure that \u2019 s infiltrated all nations ?\nYes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent .\nSo let me clarify that .\nBut let me say , I have listened to all three of those conversations and although I disagree to some extent with all of them , I certainly agree the most with Van Der Pijl ?\nWas that his name ?\nYeah .\nHe was more in line with the way I \u2019 m thinking about this .\nAlthough I tend to disagree with his economic framing and what have you .\nBut , yes , clearly this is more than a nation state 2D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now .\nAnd so for people who are interested in this , I have talked at length a number of times about the concept of 3D chess , geopolitically .\nI \u2019 m sure this is not a new concept of people by this point in 2022 .\nBut essentially , no , I do not think that the nation states waring against each other is the entirety of the game , so to speak .\nI think it is part of the game , but I think there are forces and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past couple of years are enacting an agenda across nation state borders .\nAnd a clear example of this , whether you think Russia are the good guys in some fight against evil NATO , or whether you think that they \u2019 re the bad guys that we should be trying to contain .\nIn any sense , just look at their COVID policies and the vaccine passports and the vaccines rolling out and all of this , it \u2019 s wow , it \u2019 s almost identical to what \u2019 s happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought these were arch rivals .\nWhat \u2019 s going on here ?\nAnd then you start to look at the actual specific people like the CEO of Sberbank .\nGref ?\nI forget his name .\nPeople like this that are clearly connected into the world , economic forum , explicitly , and organizations like this .\nAnd I always try to stress , I don \u2019 t think the world economic forum is running the world .\nBut I think it \u2019 s a good example that you can put your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s an organization with all these spokes that tend to go out into all of these different places that connect all of these players and all of these different supposedly waring countries .\nWhat \u2019 s going on here ?\nAnd I \u2019 ve talked about this many , many times .\nI will point once again , and I will always make the caveat that I \u2019 m not promoting this person .\nBut I think it \u2019 s a good one to use it to people who are to point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2008 , the mini Kissinger\u2026 What \u2019 s his name ?\nHe was the head of Kissinger and Associates for some time , he ran foreignpolicy.com .\nHe \u2019 s a beltway insider in Washington .\nIs that Rothkopf or something ?\nDavid Rothkopf , right ?\nRight .\nYeah .\nHe wrote The Superclass , which was a book talking explicitly about this .\nThe fact that there are actors who are not necessarily politicians , they are not in national governments who\u2026 there \u2019 s about 6,000 of them who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enact agendas across national borders .\nAnd , of course , every time he was giving Rothkopf , every time he was giving a speech about this or an interview in that time period , when the book came out , he was like , \u201c Oh , I \u2019 m not a conspiracy theorist .\nThis isn \u2019 t a conspiracy theory .\nI \u2019 m not .\nDon \u2019 t tell me [ inaudible 00:28:25 ] .\n\u201d But everything he \u2019 s saying is exactly what the crazy conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a superclass that is an oligarchical elite that is able to enact an international agenda through various bodies and things like the world economic forum , or like the Bilderberg group or these other places of power and influence where clearly there is an international agenda being set and implemented , again , as we have seen over the past couple of years .\nSo , yes , clearly there is some much , much bigger thing happening right now than merely a nation state 2D [ inaudible 00:28:57 ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Putin coffee cup .\nI \u2019 m not a Putin fanboy .\nI have it for fun .\nI picked it up when I was in St. Petersburg few years ago .\nBut I think people have to think , imagine how you , whatever citizen you are of whatever country , how you feel with your own government , right ?\nAs you said , you left statism and you became sort of an anarchist .\nAnd I think a lot of us understand that our governments are evil .\nYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with the term democide .\nDeath by Government .\nIn 20th century , government killed the most people was the cause of most deaths .\nNow imagine , if you \u2019 re a Russian living in Russia , you \u2019 re going to feel the same way as an American feels against this corrupt American government , as a Russian against its own Russian government .\nThere \u2019 s no reason for us to think the Russians are any better or the Chinese or whatever other country .\nAnd in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviewed , who was former RT , who is in Russia .\nHe lays out , his subtech is amazing .\nHe \u2019 s showing you how Russia \u2019 s going full great reset .\nAnd actually , he \u2019 s going to be contributing original material articles for Geopolitics & Empires , so people [ crosstalk 00:30:06 ] - Awesome .\nGood .\nYeah .\nHe \u2019 s doing good work .\nLet me put in a plug for him .\nI agree , I think , yeah , it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective , because it can be easy for someone in America or somewhere else to look at .\nOh , well , Putin such great leader in such the , it \u2019 s easy to say that when you are not actually in Russia beholden to the Russian system , Oh , the Russian vaccine passports are just so much better than the American version .\nLike what ?\nWhat \u2019 s going on ?\nNo , clearly , yeah .\nIt \u2019 s important to keep that perspective in mind that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other flip side of that , of course , is that it \u2019 s not I \u2019 m saying , oh , you know , we should go in and invade Russia to free them from Putin .\nThat \u2019 s , again , that \u2019 s the wrong , wrong way of thinking about it .\nSo I \u2019 m trying to bring up these are some of the big questions for me as we \u2019 ve been discussing .\nAnd war also which you mentioned that you think coming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USC war , I see the same and a number of my guests have said the same .\nI \u2019 ve talked to the Australian , Special Forces Australia , one politician , Riccardo Bosi who thinks , I \u2019 m a historian , I studied history .\nHe \u2019 s like , \u201c The default and history is war .\nPeace is the anomaly .\nWe \u2019 re going to have war again.\n\u201d The question is kind of what \u2019 s it going to kind of look like between who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other guests have also said the same that they see war from between 2025 closer to 2030 .\nBut it \u2019 s just that kind of interesting dynamic as you laid out , we \u2019 ve got these , these snakes that have infiltrated as you laid out our national government .\nSo they \u2019 re working for this global kind of power , but yet at the same time , we \u2019 ve got this overt kind of rivalry .\nWe \u2019 re seeing now between US , Russia , China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually go to war .\nSo how do you explain the logic behind that ?\nI guess what one past guest also discussed that war allows them to transform the entirety of society as well , so they can use that very much to their advantage .\nSo what are your thoughts about war in the future ?\nAll right .\nSo I sometimes tend to just say that I \u2019 m not a cartoon conspiracy theorist , where I think there \u2019 s one group that controls everything and they all meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s lay that out in detail .\nIt \u2019 s not like there is a thing called the elite and you get your membership card to the elite .\nAnd along with that you get the plan and here is the plan and here \u2019 s what \u2019 s going to happen .\nAnd here \u2019 s what you have to do with this .\nAnd does anyone think that \u2019 s how it works ?\nI certainly don \u2019 t .\nSo there are different players involved in this game who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And in sort of whether they \u2019 re on the inner side of the inner circle or the outer side of the inner circle , or the outer side of the outer circle .\nAnd different levels of understanding who are , have their own motivations , individual psychology , let alone sort of where they \u2019 re , what they believe that they \u2019 re doing and what part they \u2019 re playing .\nSo I don \u2019 t think there is a singular plan that everyone is working towards .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is part of what is happening right now .\nAnd there are nation states that do have militaries and I have no doubt that a lot of people in the military of their respective nation states are on board with the idea of the 2D chess war .\nAnd they really do see it in that those terms and they really are working towards containing , if not eradicating the enemy in the simplistic terms , etcetera .\nThere are certain people above them who may be giving orders or funding certain things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are at a different level of the game , who might understand things a bit differently and might have different allegiances .\nThey might have some allegiance to their nations state of origin , but they might have allegiance to some sort of broad category of economic interest or their fellows in various organizations , etcetera .\nSo again , a lot of people different understandings and levels that they \u2019 re playing at .\nSo , one way that hot war can actually eventuate is the hot head on the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut once there is enough pieces in place on the chess board , it just takes one wrong move at one wrong time to put the clockwork machinery into motion .\nAnd that \u2019 s one way of looking at World War I .\nYes , the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand started World War I .\nWhy ?\nLike what\u2026 How did that motivate all these different people ?\nWell , because the clockwork machinery for all of this war was already in place , all it needed was a trigger event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trigger event is ?\nWell , not necessarily , no , it was a trigger event and it set everything into motion .\nEverything had already been set up .\nIn the same way , again , like I \u2019 ve been trying to stress with the biosecurity state .\nAll of the pieces were in place .\nEverything was there , all it needed was a trigger event .\nDoes it really matter what particular trigger event it is ?\nNo it \u2019 s already set up .\nSo I think all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place right now for a hot war scenario .\nSo will it matter necessarily what the particular trigger event is ?\nWell , yeah , it \u2019 ll be interesting to see , but does it matter in terms of whether or not war originates ?\nNo , not necessarily .\nMy bigger sort of perspective on this , because people say , \u201c Well , okay .\nIf they \u2019 re both sides are controlled by the same people.\n\u201d And again , I think that might be a bit too simplistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would they then have , why would they need war at all if they control everything .\nWell , again , I don \u2019 t think they control everything .\nAnd besides the point of war is\u2026 Has always been to get land resources .\nI mean , these are the geopolitical imperatives throughout history .\nBut at this stage , the war is not against Russians or Chinese or Iranians or what have you .\nIt is against the people , the free people of the world .\nThat is what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we \u2019 re talking about .\nIdeological battle , the eugenics or transhumanism or whatever way it \u2019 s being framed in our current timeframe .\nThe real war is against the people that \u2019 s governing structures that want to consolidate power over more and more people .\nHow can they best do that ?\nWar might be a way to do that .\nTo consolidate control because one of the automatic effects of any war time is everyone rallies around the flag and supports , \u201c Okay , we \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes immediate and almost universal , which is certainly helpful .\nEspecially , during times of incredible geopolitical , economic , societal , chaos , uncertainty , a lot of things can happen .\nClearly , there are some real revolutionary forces that are happening right now , and it \u2019 s starting to manifest as , for example , the Freedom Convoy in Canada , whatever you make of that is an expression of people calling out .\nNo , this has to change .\nSomething is really wrong here .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get people in line ?\n`` Uh-oh , look at what Russia is doing !\nOkay .\nNow everybody , we have to go.\n\u201d So that \u2019 s one way of framing this .\nBut that \u2019 s why I actually did a piece on `` How Will World War III Be Fought ? ''\na year or two ago , in which I answered that question .\nI was talking about some of the technology for warfare that has really changed what warfare will look like in the future .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked nothing like war of the 19th century .\nWorld War II looked nothing like World War I .\nWorld War III will not look anything like World War II .\nBut the actual answer is that World War III is already happening .\nIt is a war of the governments of the world against their own populations .\nAnd in that war , that \u2019 s the real .\n.\n.\nthe game for all the marbles .\nSo one way of envisioning 2D chess taking place in this 3D chess universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have Oceania , you have Eurasia , you have East Asia and they \u2019 re always at war .\nOr at least we \u2019 re told , we \u2019 re at war with Eurasia , no .\nEast Asia ?\nOh , I got to check the newspaper .\nOh , it says Eurasia .\nOkay .\nI guess we \u2019 re at war with them today .\nAnd there \u2019 s bombs dropping down and we \u2019 re being told it \u2019 s well , I guess it \u2019 s Eurasia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eurasia now .\nOkay .\nIt must be them , I guess .\nI don \u2019 t know .\nAnyway , we \u2019 re at war .\nSo we have to just do what the government tells us .\nThat \u2019 s one way of thinking about this .\nObviously , I don \u2019 t mean it in that literal sense .\nThere will be real bombs dropping in the event of real hot war and they will really kill people .\nBut the idea that this is being waged simply at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s about a nation state versus a nation state rather than control of the general population .\nI think we have to get out of that mindset of thinking of it at that nation state level .\nAnd speaking of mindset , I kind of wanted to bring this up .\nSomeone in my telegram , Geopolitics & Empire Telegram channel , chat was saying , \u201c Oh , the Canada trucker convoy is a sigh up by the elites to really take down the supply chain.\n\u201d And I just kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there \u2019 s a lot of people on\u2026 I \u2019 m sure you \u2019 re listeners , my listeners and other folks , they have very partisan views and I \u2019 ve got my own views , but I \u2019 m not banging it over the head of anyone .\nAnd as you said , you listen to my last three episodes .\nAnd obviously you don \u2019 t disagree with these people , but you kind of just sit there and just , listen .\nAnd I don \u2019 t think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going about things in a way that I think is not very healthy .\nThey \u2019 ll comment , \u201c Oh , no .\nThere \u2019 s no virus , stop talk about germ theory.\n\u201d Others going to say , \u2018 No , it \u2019 s gain of function.\n\u201d Or Kazakhstan , for example they say , \u201c No , it \u2019 s a color revolution.\n\u201d And you saw my take where I gave a very nuanced view .\nAnd today it was reported in Kazakhstan that there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they \u2019 re seeing terrorists and armed groups like months before what was happening .\nThat lends credence to the idea that maybe it was a false flag or an internal coup .\nAnd so what would you say ?\nI think it \u2019 s like , \u201c Bro chill.\n\u201d We have to be a bit more respectful and nuanced , and there \u2019 s a lot of people that are just angry , hateful .\nAnd what are your thoughts on this needing to [ crosstalk 00:40:15 ] .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There \u2019 s a couple of different things I \u2019 d like to say about that .\nOne is never , ever , ever take at face value interactions that you have online with avatars that you don \u2019 t see and don \u2019 t know .\nBecause we know , 100 % , we know that there are armies of social media bots that are being run by militaries and intelligence agencies around the world .\nDocumented on a record .\nI did a podcast on that a couple of years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People can check into for the documented , we know country after country , Canada , America , Israel , all of them have botnets that they employ .\nSo don \u2019 t ever take interactions online as authentic expressions of real human beings .\nWe don \u2019 t know that , necessarily .\nBut secondarily , there are people I think , who are genuinely acting in and interacting the way that you say .\nAnd here \u2019 s the way I would frame this .\nSo think about\u2026 All right .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and imagine you \u2019 re learning guitar and you know three or four chords and someone teaches you a new chord .\n\u201c Oh , here \u2019 s a B7 .\nWoo !\nB7 .\nawesome ! ''\nSo what do you do as the sort of you \u2019 re trying to figure out what , how to play and what to do .\nAnd so now you \u2019 ve got this new chord .\nSo now you tried to put B7 in every song and everything you play .\n\u201c Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B7 chord .\nWow !\nLook at this chord.\n\u201d I understand and it \u2019 s a natural part of growing .\nSo , unfortunately , as we know , not everyone is intellectually .\n.\n.\nfiring on all cylinders .\nAnd not everyone \u2019 s a deep researcher , deep thinker , or what have you .\nAnd a lot of people who are just sort of the mainstream masses , who would just consume CNN 20 years ago , now realize at the very least , `` OK , CNN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they start to learn about false flag operations and psyop and these kinds of things .\nAnd so it \u2019 s like teaching someone the B7 chord .\nOkay , B7 .\nSo now they \u2019 re going to play that chord every single time : `` It \u2019 s a psyop !\nIt \u2019 s a pysop !\nIt \u2019 s a false flag ! ''\nBecause it \u2019 s the one thing that they know how to do .\nAnd so let \u2019 s , particularize this to the freedom convoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read that editorial , I talked about\u2014 '' Do NOT Go Back to Sleep !\nThis is NOT the End '' \u2014of course , I acknowledge absolutely this can go wrong in a lot of different ways .\nBut it always can .\nYou can \u2019 t think of any freedom movement or protest or anything that could not be co-opted , could not be corrupted , could not be used for an ulterior agenda .\nSo let \u2019 s think .\nTruckers .\nAnd now , suddenly , truckers have become synonymous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s all the truckers .\nAnd now we \u2019 re starting to see people in America and Australia and other places talking about truckers and `` We \u2019 ll have a trucker freedom convoy ! ''\nIt \u2019 s all about trucker , trucker , trucker , which is a weird way of particularizing this .\nNo , it \u2019 s actually about the broader question of mandates and freedom and what have you .\nWhy is it being particularized to truckers ?\nWell , one way that could play out .\n.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ been tested and is already being implemented in various ways .\nAutonomous self-driving trucks , specifically .\nIn fact , the first cross country , American autonomous vehicle that I ever heard about actually being tested and used was a truck , specifically for trucking .\nI mean , that \u2019 s long term .\nIf we \u2019 re going to demonize a certain class of people in order to facilitate the removal of their industry , essentially , wouldn \u2019 t that be a convenient tool ?\nSure .\nThat \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least in the long term .\nOr , at the very least , if we all associate it with the truckers and what the truckers are doing , then it can become only about that particular , that class or that person or that thing .\nAnd that could be spun in various ways by the people who are controlling the narrative , the mass media .\nSo , yes , could it be a psyop ?\nA false flag ?\n`` We \u2019 re going to implant some protestors with Nazi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in Canada , of course , they 're always marching with Confederate flags , right ?\nThat \u2019 s so natural ! ''\nOf course !\nThey \u2019 ll plant provocateurs and all sorts of things .\nAs we know , they did that at the 2007 SPP protests in Montebello , Quebec .\nThey were caught .\nThe Quebec provincial police\u2014the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec\u2014put in agents provocateur to go in there , threatening the police line with rocks in their hands , in order to promote a police response .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAbsolutely .\nAnd it can happen and presumably will happen in any movement of any size and importance .\nSo , what \u2019 s the point of this ?\nThere are clearly genuinely hundreds of thousands , if not millions of people in Canada energized and talking about the freedom mandates .\nNot every one of them is an agent provocateur .\nI \u2019 m sure there are many people\u2014Canadians in the crowd , listening to this\u2014who know genuine people or they themselves genuinely support what is happening here and the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYay , I \u2019 m behind this idea . ''\nSo it \u2019 s up to us to put that message out there and to expose the false flags and psyops and the way that they will try to spin it into some other narrative .\nIt is not up to us to sit there and wait for the CBC and the CTV and other mainstream outlets to please report this in the way we want you to report it .\nThat \u2019 s not their job .\nIn the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their boss .\nSo we have to be that .\nAnd for this brief sliver of time\u2014think of the vast expanse of human historyvfor the last 20 or so years , it has been genuinely feasible for some no name in Japan , sitting in his living room , to reach tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands , occasionally millions of people with a message so that we can put our own spin on things and say , \u201c No , no , it isn \u2019 t that .\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative .\nIt is , in some ways , the most exciting time in all of human history .\nAnd we are not spectators to what \u2019 s happening .\nAnd we are not on the sidelines analyzing and just , \u201c Oh , B7 , B7 , B7 .\nFalse flag , psyop , psyop , false flag . ''\nNo !\nWe are actually people who can make a difference to this world changing historical narrative that is playing out right now .\nAnd we can tell that story for ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for them to do it .\nIt \u2019 s an exciting time to be alive .\nIt \u2019 s an incredibly dangerous time .\nThere \u2019 s all sorts of things that can happen .\nBut , at any rate , we have a part to play in this .\nYeah , I would agree .\nIt \u2019 s exciting .\nAnd it \u2019 s what we \u2019 re doing .\nIt \u2019 s fun and as I \u2019 ve mentioned before , I feel like it \u2019 s the 1930s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well .\nAnd you started a great # SolutionsWatch series .\nAnd I often end my interviews by asking my guests , so what do we do now ?\nAnd the most frequent answers I get from many of my guests are , decentralized , move from urban to rural .\nGrow food , have your own water form , a community , very important .\nInvest in physical assets become less dependent and more independence .\nAnd I \u2019 m also worried about the cyber pandemic , that \u2019 s in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t have time to ask you about that , but it seems like we \u2019 re going to have to be dealing with it .\nThey \u2019 re discussing , taking down podcasts now , and even the platforming websites , like these are our last lines of defense .\nI think our podcasts and , and websites , that \u2019 s why I moved to epic hosting , but I think part of this Joe Rogan scandal now is they \u2019 ve been talking for a signaling for the last few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , they , they can \u2019 t control podcasts .\nSo in general , what are some of your\u2026 What do we do going forward ?\nYeah .\nThank you for picking up on that actually , because that \u2019 s actually , I talked about the midterm agenda of CBDCs and the long term agenda of some sort of hot war .\nI think the short term is actually cyber related .\nCyber pandemic or cyber false flag or something along those lines to lead us towards greater control of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always : `` OK , great .\nLots of problems .\nWe know about the problems , James .\nWhat do you do about them ? ''\nSo that is why I did start the # SolutionsWatch series where every week , week in and week out , I \u2019 m looking at specific things that people can do or apply in their lives to make their lives better .\nI do not believe there \u2019 s a silver bullet .\nI think there are thousands bullets and not every bullet works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different guns to extend that analogy way too far .\nBut , at any rate , use whatever you can to improve your life in whatever ways you can .\nAnd hopefully , people who are consciously setting their intent on getting out of the systems and strictures of control can find ways to do so .\nAnd so I look at various ways .\no , for example , on the cyber pandemic and the threats to the internet , as we \u2019 ve known it and the very real threat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve seen that absolutely for the past couple of years : \u201c Oh , no , podcasts .\nPeople can say whatever they want .\nOh , please , someone censor !\n\u201d Well , there \u2019 s different ways that that can happen .\nAnd one of them is that the easiest censorship point will be the Spotifys , the Apple Podcast , the Google Podcasts .\n.\n.\nof course , all the centralized hubs where people go to get podcasts will be censored , first of all .\nBut that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at base how podcasting even works .\nAt base , podcasting is based on RSS , Really Simple Syndication , which you do not need to go through the Apple Store or Spotify or whatever , to get a podcast .\nYou can go directly to a website or as long as you have that RSS feed , you can plug that into any number of different applications and you will be able to get that podcast delivered to you .\nSo that \u2019 s a one like basic fallback step that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solution , but it \u2019 s a step away from that centralization of control .\nLearn about RSS and what it is and how it works .\nAnd suddenly , even if they take the corporate report or Geopolitics & Empire off of Apple podcasts or whatever , you \u2019 ll still be able to get the podcast !\nWouldn \u2019 t that be nice ?\nSo steps like that .\nAnd then you build up from there .\nOK , well they \u2019 re going to come after domains .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nbecause the domain name system is like the telephone book for the internet .\nIf they take away the telephone book , I won \u2019 t be able to call corbettreport.com .\nWell , OK .\nSo what can we do about that ?\nThere are decentralized domain ideas , the dot crypto addresses and others that are , do not rely on the DNS system and thus can not be just scrubbed at the whim of a nation state .\nThings like that .\nBut then , they \u2019 re going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldwide web itself .\nThey \u2019 re going to make you scanned to get on the web .\nAnd so , OK .\nSo can we bypass the ISPs ?\nCan we go , do we need the worldwide web ?\nWhat about IPFS or some of these other ways of connecting peer to peer ?\nLike , the internet is supposed to be used , but we \u2019 ve all just been conditioned into thinking Facebook and TikTok are , is the internet , right ?\nNo , no , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start learning about that .\nIf you \u2019 re talking about vaccine mandates , I \u2019 ve done an entire post about different ways to protest or fight against or work around vaccine mandates .\nIf you are talking about the CBDC agenda and digital currency and all of this .\nI \u2019 ve talked about Cash Fridays or Black Market Fridays , different ways to start increasing your\u2026 Decreasing your reliance on digital forms of exchange and increasing and your reliance on things like cash , which still exists for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use while we still have it .\nEt cetera , et cetera .\nFor everything that we have talked about today , there are things that are being done , there are people that are working on ideas .\nThere are things that you can start implementing in your life today .\nThe only question is , are you interested in that ?\nAnd if you are then go out there and start finding and let me know about it too , because I \u2019 m always looking for ideas for solutions watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did an episode on RSS , which I remember looking at .\nAll right , apart from Corbettreport.com , is there any other website or project you \u2019 re working on that we should know about ?\nI think that \u2019 s the place to go .\nAnd from there , you can find all of my minds and odyssey , and all my channels and everything , but just go to corbettreport.com for the time being that is the place to go .\nBut also on the sidebar at the very bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on IPFS where you can click and you can get the IPFS backup of The Corbett Report site .\nAll of the audio and video is backed up .\nI believe it hasn \u2019 t backed up since last April because my site map broke , and I haven \u2019 t had time to fix it .\nI \u2019 m going to do that .\nAnd when it does it \u2019 ll update again .\nAt any rate , if the corporate report suddenly disappeared overnight , well , at least all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on IPFS .\nAll right , everyone , again : bookmark Corbettreport.com .\nSign up for the free newsletter .\nI get it .\nAnd also consider supporting James for as low as even $ 1 a month for us podcasters and content creators , every single digital peso counts .\nThank you for being at Geopolitics & Empire , se\u00f1or

''\nThe assailant , 41-year-old Tetsuya Yamagami , did not attempt to escape .\nHe was arrested and has been interrogated by police .\nThe gun used by Yamagami has been described as a `` bizarre homemade firearm '' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been published : The crude gun , we are told , was likely assembled using the weapons training that Yamagami received during his three year stint in Japan 's Maritime Self-Defense Force ( the Japanese Navy in all but name ) .\nPolice have since raided what we are told is Yamagami 's apartment and have reportedly discovered a variety of similarly handmade weapons .\nFor example , this : Although Abe was an ex-prime minister\u2014having stepped down in 2020 due to health issues\u2014 he was still very much a force in Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese Diet and , crucially , still wielding enormous influence in the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , the perennial ruling party of Japan .\nHe came from a politically influential family\u2014his maternal grandfather , Nobusuke Kishi , served as prime minister from 1957 to 1960 and was known as `` the Monster of the Showa Era '' for his brutal rule over Manchuria in the 1930s\u2014which likely accounted for his first appointment as prime minister in 2006 .\nAbe 's first stint as PM did not go well : His cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during his term the LDP lost its control of the upper house of the Japanese Diet for the first time in its 52-year political history .\nAs a result , he only lasted one year as PM before resigning the position .\nBut , in a testament to his enduring power behind the scenes in the bureaucratic Japanese government , Abe got a second shot at the nation 's top job in 2012 .\nThis time , he came to power with an ambitious agenda : he wanted to transform Japan 's `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by reforming the Japanese constitution and abolishing its pacifist clause .\nHe wanted to pull the Japanese economy out of its decades-long tailspin with a set of economic reforms that would be dubbed `` Abenomics . ''\nAnd he wanted to reassert Japan geopolitically , buddying up to Trump , warmongering with China and starting a trade war with South Korea in the process .\nAbe 's record speaks for itself .\nHe did not pull Japan out of its economic tailspin .\nHe lied about the safety of Fukushima .\nHe oversaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill '' that allows the government to suppress free speech and reporting in the country .\nHe played along with the scamdemic .\nHe was a World Economic Forum darling and pushed the UN Agenda 2030 Sustainable Enslavement agenda , from the carbon eugenics swindle to the ESG scam .\nHe dreamed of a Klaus Schwab-like transhuman fourth industrial revolution nightmare , which he dubbed `` Society 5.0 . ''\nIn other words , Abe was just another obedient globalist supergopher .\nHe certainly had his political enemies , of course , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed assured .\nWhy , then , would he be gotten rid of ?\nAccording to reports , Yamagami has told investigators he was not motivated by disagreement with Abe 's political beliefs , but `` rumors about the former leader 's connection to a certain organization that police did not identify . ''\nOther reports assert that Yamagami blamed the group for having bankrupted herself by donating to the organization .\nSpeculation about the identity of this `` certain organization '' is currently centered around The Unification Church .\nThe Family Federation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Unification Church but perhaps best known as the church that `` The Moonies '' belong to\u2014was founded by the Reverend Sun Myung Moon in 1954 .\nAlthough known primarily in the West for its mass weddings ( and its ownership of The Washington Times ) , its Japanese branch has been identified as part of `` the grassroots conservative movement in Japan . ''\nMore to the point , some have noted that `` Abe \u2019 s grandfather had played a major role in establishing the early Unification Church in Japan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congratulatory telegram to a `` front group '' for the church back in 2006 , an act which generated some controversy at the time .\nAnother organization that comes up in association with Abe ( and with the Unification Church ) is Nippon Kaigi .\nDescribed as the `` largest and most powerful conservative right-wing organization '' , Nippon Kaigi ( the `` Japan Conference '' ) was established in 1997 as a result of a combination of two previous Japanese political groups .\nIt pushes a wish list of Japanese nationalist agenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as head of state , the restoration of the Japanese military , constitutional changes and education reforms\u2014that only the hard-of-thinking will fail to notice coincide with Abe 's political agenda .\nThis is no coincidence ; Abe served as a `` special advisor '' to the group 's parliamentary league .\nAnd then there 's \u60aa\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\u7d50\u793e ( Evil secret organization ) .\nIf that sounds like a weird , made up thing from the fringier side of the conspiracy theory world , that 's because it is .\nApparently the Japanese version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014which was reportedly established in December of last year with the explicit aim or `` protect [ ing ] children \u2019 s lives from COVID vaccination , '' and which was responsible for storming a vaccination site in April where they demanded to be shown the ingredients of the vaccine\u2014contains some members with some rather outlandish beliefs .\nAccording to an investigative report done by some Japanese ambush journalists , Yamato Q believes that `` The Yamato people ( Japanese ) originally inherited the genes of good aliens and dragon gods , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information control of the deep state ( dark power ) and Illuminati ( secret society of evil ) . ''\nNaturally , they believe it is up to members of the group to `` awaken the sleeping DNA to awaken the true power of the Yamato people . ''\nTo be clear , the most straightforward statement about the `` certain organization '' that has emerged so far is a report that Yamagami `` intended to target a senior official of a religious group '' who was , apparently , not at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't even the primary target of the assassin .\nThen again , the same report also indicates that `` the suspect has made nonsensical statements , and Nara Prefectural Police are carefully investigating whether he is mentally competent to be held criminally responsible , '' so take all of this information with a gigantic grain of salt .\nIn any event , the fact that police appear to be purposefully withholding the name of this organization\u2014ostensibly in order to avoid a religious or racist backlash against the group and its members\u2014will likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yamagami who reportedly believe that the group in question controls the media and powerful politicians like Abe .\nThere is still much we do not know about the incident : \u2022 Who is Yamagami ?\nA patsy ?\nA decoy ?\nA lone gunman ?\nA wingnut ?\nAn agent of a dark agenda ?\n\u2022 Was Abe 's death politically motivated , or was it\u2014as reports of Yamagami 's testimony now indicate\u2014religiously motivated ?\nNeither of the above ?\n\u2022 Was there deep state complicity in this event or was it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What effect will this have on the course of Japanese politics ?\nOn domestic security laws ?\nAlthough we are unlikely to receive believable answers to these questions from the police and the establishment media any time soon , the answers to these questions will become clear in the coming days and weeks .\nAs James Evan Pilato often observes , the real action of potentially world-changing events like this one is in the reaction .\nThankfully , the idea that this event will be blamed on some foreign power and used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point ( although reports indicate that the Chinese government has had to step in to `` tamp down '' the cries of celebration from certain corners of Chinese social media ) .\nBut there are other agendas that this assassination could serve .\nMedia reports about Yamagami 's homemade arsenal , for example , could be played up to warn of the dangers of lone nuts ordering parts off the internet and any number of security laws could be implemented on the back of this incident .\nThe political reorganization that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in Japanese government policy that may result from that reorganization also remain open questions for now , but ones that , when answered , could provide clues as to the real meaning of this assassination .\nTime will tell .\nIn the meantime , Corbett Report members are urged to continue the open source investigation as information continues to come out on the incident .", "author": "Corbett", "url": "https://www.corbettreport.com/the-assassination-of-abe/", "published": "Sat, 09 Jul 2022 12:33:06 +0000",

mirrors\u2014were fiendishly difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead or pewter plates with a curved mirror in the middle\u2014were even more difficult to make .\nBut in fifteenth-century Germany , they were in hot demand .\nIt all goes back to the year 800 , when Emperor Charlemagne gifted four holy relics from Jerusalem to the Cathedral in Aachen in modern-day Germany : the swaddling clothes and loin cloth of Jesus , Mary 's robe , and the cloth that held John the Baptist 's decapitated head .\nThe relics were thought to have miraculous restorative powers .\nAnd so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were removed from the Cathedral 's golden shrine and put on display for the public once every seven years , attracting tens of thousands of pilgrims from across Christendom .\nSoon , the belief developed that a curved mirror could be held up to the relics to capture their miraculous powers and bring them back to the pilgrims ' home in whatever far-flung land they hailed from .\nNow , the mirror was not a mirror like the ones we 're used to today .\nIt was a pilgrim badge and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Middle Ages .\nThey were lucrative products to make .\nSo lucrative , in fact , that the goldsmiths and stamp cutters of Aachen could n't keep up with the demand .\nEnter Johannes Gutenberg .\nBorn around the turn of the fifteenth-century to a wealthy family in Mainz , in modern-day Germany , Gutenberg\u2014whose father was a companion of the ecclesiastical mint\u2014had a background in goldsmithing , coinmaking and metalwork .\nArriving in Strasbourg in 1434 , he thought to put his skills to work on a profitable venture : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1439 .\nThere was only one problem : he did n't have the capital to make the badges himself .\nSo he entered into a cooperative with three business partners , each of whom ponied up a portion of the money required for Gutenberg to start producing the mirrors .\nBut just as the pilgrimage approached and it looked like the inventor was going to make a tidy profit for himself and his business partners , the Black Death struck again .\nAn outbreak of the plague ravaged the Upper Rhine Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year .\nGutenberg had already produced a number of the mirrors , but his capital was running out .\nAnd so he set his sights on a new venture\u2014one so audacious , so revolutionary that he made his partners sign a contract swearing them to secrecy before he would let them in on it .\nIn fact , so secret was this project that the only reason we know anything at all about it is because one of the business partners died and his brother tried to take his place in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to let him in on the plot , the would-be co-conspirator sued Gutenberg in Strasbourg court .\nThe court documents that survive are themselves cryptic\u2014referring to the `` adventure and art '' of `` the work '' that Gutenberg and his partners were engaged in , but never specifying what that work was , exactly .\nWe know that it involved presses fastened with screws and engraved `` forms '' supplied by a local goldsmith , that some quantity of metal had been purchased for the venture , that the work was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the

Media Matrix .\nYou see , in the Middle Ages , mirrors\u2014especially curved mirrors\u2014were fiendishly difficult to make .\nAnd pilgrim badges\u2014elaborately designed lead or pewter plates with a curved mirror in the middle\u2014were even more difficult to make .\nBut in fifteenth-century Germany , they were in hot demand .\nIt all goes back to the year 800 , when Emperor Charlemagne gifted four holy relics from Jerusalem to the Cathedral in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes and loin cloth of Jesus , Mary 's robe , and the cloth that held John the Baptist 's decapitated head .\nThe relics were thought to have miraculous restorative powers .\nAnd so , after the Black Death of 1349 , they were removed from the Cathedral 's golden shrine and put on display for the public once every seven years , attracting tens of thousands of pilgrims from across Christendom .\nSoon , the belief developed that a curved mirror could be held up to the relics to capture their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pilgrims ' home in whatever far-flung land they hailed from .\nNow , the mirror was not a mirror like the ones we 're used to today .\nIt was a pilgrim badge and it was one of the few mass-manufactured items of the Middle Ages .\nThey were lucrative products to make .\nSo lucrative , in fact , that the goldsmiths and stamp cutters of Aachen could n't keep up with the demand .\nEnter Johannes Gutenberg .\nBorn around the turn of the fifteenth-century to a wealthy family in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was a companion of the ecclesiastical mint\u2014had a background in goldsmithing , coinmaking and metalwork .\nArriving in Strasbourg in 1434 , he thought to put his skills to work on a profitable venture : creating badges for the next Aachen Pilgrimage in 1439 .\nThere was only one problem : he did n't have the capital to make the badges himself .\nSo he entered into a cooperative with three business partners , each of whom ponied up a portion of the money required for Gutenberg to start producing the mirrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it looked like the inventor was going to make a tidy profit for himself and his business partners , the Black Death struck again .\nAn outbreak of the plague ravaged the Upper Rhine Valley in 1438 , postponing the pilgrimage by a year .\nGutenberg had already produced a number of the mirrors , but his capital was running out .\nAnd so he set his sights on a new venture\u2014one so audacious , so revolutionary that he made his partners sign a contract swearing them to secrecy before he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , so secret was this project that the only reason we know anything at all about it is because one of the business partners died and his brother tried to take his place in the cooperative .\nBut after the surviving partners refused to let him in on the plot , the would-be co-conspirator sued Gutenberg in Strasbourg court .\nThe court documents that survive are themselves cryptic\u2014referring to the `` adventure and art '' of `` the work '' that Gutenberg and his partners were engaged in , but never specifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We know that it involved presses fastened with screws and engraved `` forms '' supplied by a local goldsmith , that

our lives in it and through it .\nWe structure our lives around it .\nBut it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get here ?\nAnd where is the media technology that increasingly governs our lives taking us ?\nThis is the story of The Media Matrix .\nThere 's a story about the famous Battle of Waterloo in 1815 that is not usually included in the history textbooks .\nThe story is that John Roworth\u2014a trusted employee of Nathan Rothschild , the English heir of the infamous Rothschild banking family\u2014was at the battlefield that day and , when the battle was decided and it was apparent that Napoleon had been defeated , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news across the English channel .\nThe messenger arrived at his employers 's London office a full 24 hours before the official government courier and Rothschild , always looking for a way to turn a profit , decided to use the news to his advantage .\nHe made a show of selling his shares at the London Stock Exchange and the public , believing the famed stockbroker had received word that Napoleon had won the battle , began selling as well .\nThe stock market plummeted and Rothschild secretly bought up the shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news finally reached Londoners that Wellington\u2014not Napoleon\u2014was the victor at Waterloo , the coup was complete : Nathan Rothschild was the richest man in the realm .\nThis story , like so many historical adventure yarns , has been much decorated in the retelling : John Roworth was not at Waterloo , for one thing , and there was no great market sell-off in the hours before the official news of the battle reached London .\nBut the central part of the tale is true : Nathan Rothschild did receive early news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` do well '' by that information , as Roworth admitted in a letter the month after the incident .\nBut whatever this story tells us about the world of finance , it tells us something more fundamental about something far more important : power .\nKnowledge is power , and , as we saw in Part 1 of this series , Gutenberg had brought that power to the masses .\nWith the printing press , knowledge could be copied and spread to the far corners of the globe faster and easier and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n.\n.\n.\n.\nbut it still had to be carried .\nOn horseback , on foot , by train , by carrier pigeon .\nInformation was still a physical thing and even the news of Napoleon 's defeat at Waterloo had to be physically transported from one place to another .\nBut did it have to be this way ?\nWhat if information could be communicated directly by electric current and sent across wires or through the air at the speed of light ?\nMorse was not a scientist or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed that the idea for sending messages through electrical wires came to him in a flash of genius on a lengthy ship journey from Europe to America in 1832 , and thus that he deserved credit as the sole inventor of the telegraph .\nIn reality , research along these lines had been going on for nearly a century .\nThe idea of sending electrical messages through wires was first proposed in Scots Magazine in 1753 and it was demonstrated numerous times over the years\u2014most memorably by Francisco Salv\u00e1 , who in 1795 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned each of them a letter , and instructed them to shout their letter out when they received a shock .\nIgnorant of this history , Morse had to rely on real scientists and inventors for his important breakthroughs .\nLike Professor Leonard Gale , who helped develop the technique of using relays to help the messages travel further than a few hundred yards .\nAnd Alfred Vail , a bright young machinist whose improvements to Morse 's crude prototype brought the idea into reality .\nMany even contend that it was Vail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of dots and dashes that we know as Morse Code .\nNonetheless , history is written by the winners , and Morse proved to be the winner .\nGetting the credit , the glory and , more to the point , the patent for the telegraph , Morse received a congressional appropriation of $ 30,000 to build the first telegraph line from Washington to Baltimore in 1844 .\nHe sent the first official telegraph message from the US Capitol to Alfred Vail at a railroad station in Baltimore .\nThe message had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter of the Patent Commissioner with whom Morse was lodging while he was stationed in Washington .\nShe chose a passage from the Bible fitting of the momentous occasion : `` What hath God wrought ! ''\nThe passage , from the book of Numbers , is one of praise\u2014rejoicing at the wonders that God had wrought for Israel\u2014and ends with an exclamation mark .\nBut the telegraph message did n't contain punctuation , and so the press misreported the phrase with a question mark at the end : `` What hath God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to change the message .\nIt 's difficult for us to appreciate just how incredible it was for those who first witnessed communication from a distance with a disembodied electric ghost .\nIn fact , it was almost impossible for people to understand this type of communication in anything but spiritual terms .\nEven the word `` medium '' evokes the specter of contact with the spirit world .\nWhen the radio was introduced to Saudi Arabia , the country 's conservative Islamic clerics declared it `` the devil hiding in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ban the infernal contraption .\nThe king saw the potential use of the radio for the development of the country , but , relying on the clerics for support , he could n't outright reject their council .\nInstead , the crafty monarch proposed a test : the radio would be brought before him the next day and he would listen to it himself .\nIf what the clerics said was true , then he would ban the devil 's device and behead those responsible for bringing it into the country .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the king at the appointed time .\nBut the king had secretly arranged with the radio engineers to make sure the Quran was being read at the hour of the test .\nSure enough , when he switched it on and passages from the Quran were heard .\n`` Can it be that the devil is saying the Quran ? ''\nhe asked .\n`` Or is it perhaps true that this is not an evil box ? ''\nThe clerics conceded defeat and the radio was allowed into Saudi Arabia .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not the first or the last to mistake media technology for devilry .\nIn 1449 , Johann Fust\u2014the scion of a wealthy and powerful family in Mainz\u2014lent Gutenberg an enormous sum of money to start producing his famed Bible and confiscated the books from the printer when he could n't afford to repay the loan .\nWhen Fust later appeared on the streets of Paris , selling multiple copies of Gutenberg 's Bible , the bewildered Parisians\u2014who had never seen printed books before and so could n't imagine how so many strangely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced so quickly\u2014arrested him for witchcraft .\nThe essence of the mass media\u2014its ability to project the voices of people who are n't there using electronic gadgets and wireless networks\u2014is the essence of magic , bringing to life the scrying mirrors and palantirs of lore .\nBut is this media technology a dark art , or can its powers be used for good ?\nAs the new medium of commercial radio rose in the early decades of the 20th century , listeners had cause to side with the Saudi clerics in their determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a devil in a box .\nListeners like those who tuned into a strange news report on the Columbia Broadcasting System on the evening of Sunday , October 30 , 1938 .\nOf course , this was n't a news broadcast at all .\nIt was the infamous `` Halloween Scare , '' Orson Wells ' radio adaptation of The War of the Worlds , which infamously caused panic among some members of the listening audience who were flipping through the dial and mistook the dramatized news `` interruptions '' for actual reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become fashionable in recent years to downplay the incident as a myth .\nThere was no real scare , only a few dimwits who got frightened .\nThe newspapers\u2014looking for any excuse to belittle radio , its fast-rising competition for the public 's attention and corporate advertising dollars\u2014ginned up the story and sold the public on a panic that never was .\nBut there was something to the Halloween Scare .\nThe City Manager of Trenton , New Jersey\u2014mentioned by name in the broadcast\u2014even wrote to the Federal Communications Commission to demand an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response , a team of researchers fanned out , collecting information , conducting interviews and studying reports about the panic to better understand what had happened and what could be learned about this new medium 's ability to influence the public .\nThe team was from the Princeton Radio Project\u2014a research group founded with a two-year , $ 67,000 grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to study the effect of radio through the lens of social psychology .\nThe team was led by Hadley Cantril , the old Dartmouth College roommate of Nelson Rockefeller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ r ] adio is an altogether novel medium of communication , preeminent as a means of social control and epochal in its influence upon the mental horizons of men . ''\nCantril 's report on Wells ' Halloween broadcast , The Invasion from Mars , concluded that such a large-scale media-induced frenzy could happen again `` and even on a much more extensive scale . ''\nThis was important information for the funders of the Princeton Radio Project ; their next major research project was a study of how radio could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly important subject as the world slipped into the maw of World War II .\nThe question of electronic media 's ability to influence the public became even more important as the radio revolution of the early twentieth century flowed into the television revolution of the mid-twentieth century .\nTelevision had actually been ready to roll out as a commercial medium in the 1930s , but the Depression and then the war delayed the mass production of television sets .\nThe first mass-produced commercial television hit the market in 1946 , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted technologies in history to that point , finding its way into the majority of American homes within a decade .\nStrangely , as sociologist Robert Putnam documented in his 2000 bestseller , Bowling Alone , the era of television adoption precisely coincides with a severe drop-off in civic engagement among the American public .\nCould there be a relation ?\nIf so , what could it be ?\nOne intriguing possibility comes from research conducted by Herbert Krugman in 1969 .\nKrugman\u2014who would go on to become manager of public opinion research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discover what happens physiologically in the brain of a person watching TV .\nHe taped a single electrode to the back of his test subject 's head and ran the wire to a Grass Model 7 Polygraph , which in turn interfaced with a Honeywell 7600 computer and a CAT 400B computer .\nHe turned on the TV and began monitoring the brain waves of his subject .\nHe found through repeated testing that `` within about thirty seconds , the brain-waves switched from predominantly beta waves , indicating alert and conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicating an unfocused , receptive lack of attention : the state of aimless fantasy and daydreaming below the threshold of consciousness . ''\nKrugman 's initial findings were confirmed by more extensive and accurate testing : TV rapidly induces an alpha-state consciousness in its viewers , putting them in a daydream state that leaves them less actively focused on their activities and more receptive to suggestion .\nThis dream state combines with the nature of the medium itself to create a perfect tool for disengaging the viewers intellectually , removing them from active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience with the simulacrum of experience .\nAs we have seen , it was only a matter of years from the advent of commercial radio as a medium of communication until monopolistic financial interests were funding studies to determine how best to use it to mould the public consciousness .\nAnd , it seems , the television\u2014with its brain wave-altering , hypnosis-inducing , cognitive impairment abilities\u2014was designed from the very get-go to be a weapon of control deployed against the viewing public .\nBut if these media are weapons , if they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public 's attention and , ultimately , their thoughts , it begs some questions : Who is wielding these weapons ?\nAnd for what purpose ?\nThis is no secret conspiracy .\nThe answer is not difficult to find .\nTimeWarner and Disney and Comcast NBC Universal and News Corp and Sony and Universal Music Group and the handful of other companies that have consolidated control over the `` mediaopoly '' of the electronic media are the ones wielding the media weapon .\nTheir boards of directors are public information .\nTheir major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network of wealthy and powerful people control what is broadcast by the corporate media , and , by extension , wield the media weapon to shape society in their interest .\nIn Part 1 of this series , we noted how technological advancements in the printing press and the development of new business models for the publishing industry had taken Gutenberg 's revolutionary technology out of the hands of the public and put it into the hands of the few rich industrialists with the capital to afford their own newspaper or book publisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemingly inevitably , to the Morgan conspiracy .\nBut that process did n't end with the electrification of the media ; it accelerated .\nBy the end of the twentieth century , a handful of media companies controlled the vast majority of what Americans read , saw and heard .\nThat this situation was used to control what the public thought about important topics is , by now , obvious to all .\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century , this media oligopoly had cemented its control over the public mind .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and radio had the ability to direct people 's thoughts on any given topic , or even what they thought about .\nThe zenith of that era was reached on September 11 , 2001 , when billions across the globe watched the dramatic events of 9/11 play out on their television screens like a big-budget Hollywood production .\nBut the media was not done evolving .\nTechnologies were already being rolled out that would once again change the public 's relationship to the media .\nTechnologies that would once again leave people questioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a box , wondering whether this new media was a tool of empowerment or control , and asking the question : What hath God wrought ?\nNext week : Into the Metaverse",

our lives around it .\nBut it was n't always this way .\nSo how did we get here ?\nAnd where is the media technology that increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the story of The Media Matrix .\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century , if you saw anything , read anything , listened to anything , it was , more likely than not , placed in front of you by one of the handful of corporations that controlled the major television and radio networks , newspaper syndicates , film studios and music companies .\nThese companies did n't control what people thought ; it was more subtle than that .\nThese companies controlled what people thought about .\nWe all knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We all heard the latest Billboard chart topper .\nWe all saw the latest episode of Must See TV and we all knew about the latest Hollywood blockbuster .\nEven if we managed to avoid these media ourselves , we knew them anyway from cultural osmosis .\nYes , by the year 2000 we had arrived at the pinnacle of mediated reality .\nThe media oligopoly 's control of society was complete , and nothing could ever come along to change it .\nAnd then something did .\nGiven that the only thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the internet is ruining society , it 's difficult to remember that the general public 's introduction to the World Wide Web was accompanied by a torrent of hyperbole and over-the-top enthusiasm that would make a pimply-faced teenager blush .\nThe internet was going to solve all of our problems !\nIt was going to democratize information .\nIt was going to give a voice to the voiceless .\nIt was going to bring the world together .\nAnd most importantly , it was going to help us order pizza without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's easy to laugh at the gee-whizery and pie-in-the-sky promises of the Information Superhighway hype .\nBut make no mistake : the advent of the web was a revolution .\nIt did upend the economic model that had given rise to the media oligopoly in the first place .\nAnd it did give a voice to countless millions around the globe who would never have been heard at all if it were n't for the advent of new media platforms .\nAs the general public started to get online in the 1990s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cyber-utopian fancy could have imagined the sea change in news and information that was about to sweep over the public .\nAs the printing press had given birth to our very concept of `` the news '' and as radio and then television again transformed our understanding of what it meant to hear or see the news , so , too , did this new medium change our perceptions of world events and our relationship to them .\nSuddenly , `` the news '' was not something you heard a well-coiffed elderly man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar studio reading to you from a teleprompter .\nIn the online age , the news was as likely to be a story written from home by a guy in his pajamas or a video of a protest uploaded from someone 's smartphone or a tweet by an anonymous account .\nBlogs and websites , and , later , Facebook feeds and Reddit posts , became places people went for news and analysis on breaking events .\nInformation was condensed into memes , and meme literacy became necessary to even understand what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the media whose hold over the public mind had seemed so unassailable mere decades ago was now old hat , reduced to just another stream of information accessible on the always on , infinite scrolling online content feeds .\nBut if we have learned anything from this study of mass media history by now , it 's that a predictable pattern is at play : a new technology transforms the way people communicate and promises a flowering of knowledge and understanding .\nThe existing power structure then spends all of its considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ultimately , using the new media as an even more effective tool for spreading propaganda .\nAs we saw in Part 1 of this series , the Gutenberg press sparked a true revolution , overturning the social , political and economic order and empowering individuals to share ideas on a scale never before imaginable .\nBut we also saw the censors swooping in to repress those ideas before the corporatization of the press finally tamed the mighty juggernaut that Gutenberg had unleashed .\nAnd , as we saw in Part 2 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompted the Rockefellers and other entrenched financial interests to begin studying how best to use the electronic media to shape the public consciousness .\nAnd television , with its ability to put its viewers into an alpha brainwave state of susceptibility , proved to be an even more effective tool for the corporate interests that soon monopolized the public airwaves .\nThe story of the World Wide Web follows a depressingly similar trajectory .\nWhatever promise the internet held to kick off a new Gutenberg revolution\u2014putting the power of the press back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been consistently betrayed by the the centralization of online discovery and identity into corporations , as even Twitter founder Jack Dorsey now admits .\nPerhaps the fact that the web has been so quickly co-opted into a medium of control is n't surprising .\nAfter all , the internet is no movable type printing press .\nHowever much work went into the design of the printing press , it was still possible for a skilled fifteenth century craftsman to create and operate one with nothing more than the knowledge of the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business partners .\nBut the internet arose not from a medieval tinkerer 's workshop , but from the bowels of the Pentagon .\nThe long history of collusion between Big Tech , the Pentagon and the US intelligence community is by now a well-documented one .\nThe story leads from Silicon Valley\u2014home of Big Tech and the site of much of the research that helped birth the personal computer revolution and the internet\u2014through Pentagon research grants and In-Q-Tel investments to the development of the ARPANet , the birth of the internet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Facebook and the World Wide Web as we know it today .\nThe result of that history is apparent to all by now .\nA medium that should be the most participatory medium ever invented has become a web to trap its audience in an infinite scroll of social media distraction , one designed specifically to keep its users seeking the scientifically scheduled hit of their next dopamine reward .\nThe results of Big Tech 's experiment are now in : the would-be social engineers were successful beyond their wildest expectation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its wake lay the increasingly mechanistic automatons of the social media revolution , eschewing the dull world of human interaction for the cyber world of likes , shares and dopamine rewards .\nThe smartphone has become the digital god of the zombie hordes , demanding we bow down in prayer at every free moment .\nPerhaps most frightening of all is the astonishing speed with which this revolution is taking place .\nAs transformative as Gutenberg 's press was , it took decades for the technology to propagate out across Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that technological upheaval to play itself out in the body politic .\nThe electronic media revolution took the better part of a century of development from its earliest iteration , the telegraph , to its introduction to the average person 's living room in the form of radio sets , and , later , televisions .\nBut the online media revolution has happened with astonishing speed .\nIn the span of one decade , smartphones went from curious novelties to ubiquitous items , and they are now on the cusp of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis incredible change is already manifesting in a world of profound and rapid dislocations in every facet of our lives : political , economic and social .\nSo where is this revolution taking us ?\nCan we learn to navigate this new world of nearly constant mediated experience ?\nShould we ?\nTo answer that , we need to look at the nature of media itself .\nMedia , from the earliest smoke signals and scratches in clay tablets to the printed page to the recorded images and sounds of the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means for extending our bodies in space and time .\nThe written word is an extension of our mind out into the world , allowing people in far-distant places and far-off times to read our innermost thoughts .\nThe phonograph was an extension of our voice , the filmed image an extension of our bodies themselves , permitting them a type of 2D immortality .\nBut somewhere along the way , the balance between the media and the real world that it represents began to shift .\nWe went from this world to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see , most of what we hear , most of what we think we know about the world comes not from the people and places that populate our direct , lived experience , but from mere representations .\nWe have our friends , of course , but we also have Friends .\nWe have neighbours , but we also have Neighbours .\nWe have something better than real life .\nWe have reality TV !\nWe have entered the world of the simulacrum .\nAt a certain point , the boundaries between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media begin to blur .\nIs television reflecting the types of people we are , or are we emulating the characters we see on TV ?\nAre the sad songs we listen to the product of broken-hearted people or the cause ?\nBut if nothing is less real than reality TV , what is the reality that that TV is attempting to portray ?\nDoes it even exist anymore ?\nThis is no idle question .\nAs pervasive as the online media has become , as important as our participation in that mediated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a new medium has already appeared .\nThe metaverse .\nIntroduced to the public consciousness by the likes of Mark Zuckerberg , the metaverse represents the apotheosis of the media revolution .\nSoon , the internet will not exist as a cyperspace that we access through our clunky smartphone gadget .\nInstead , it will be a fully realized , immersive , 3D virtual world that we can literally step into .\nNo matter our reluctance to enter this virtual world , we will soon , all of us , have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether by putting on the glasses and adding an augmented reality layer to the world as we know it , or by strapping on the goggles and entering the cyber domain completely .\nAnd , after we do so , we may find the idea of living our lives in bare , unmediated reality will be as quaint , as unthinkable , as living in a world of smoke signals and clay tablets .\nWe stand at a precipice .\nOn one side is `` reality '' : the original , authentic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side is the metaverse : the world of constantly mediated experience .\nIn the middle is hyperreality , that blurry space between the real world and the mediated world .\nAnd , living as we do on this side of the electronic media revolution , it is the only place we have ever known .\nIt has been suggested that the metaverse is not a space\u2014not a virtual world that we can jack ourselves into and live a virtual life , like in The Matrix\u2014but a time .\nSpecifically , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives become more meaningful to us than our `` real '' lives .\nIf that is the case , then who can deny that , for an increasing number of people around the world , that time has already arrived ?\nIn this series we have examined the history of the mass media , from the Gutenberg Revolution to today .\nBut if we do n't understand that history , then we will be like the ignorant masses identified by George Santayana , condemned to repeat a past that we can not remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of media is merely the story of the development of the machinery of communciation .\nThe movement from the printing press to the telegraph to the radio to the television to the internet to the metaverse is a story of technological progress , and each new technology brings us closer to the ideal of total communication .\nBut there is a more fundamental perspective , one that sees media not as a technology , but as the expression of our need as human beings to connect with others , to fight off our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked into the world through communion with others .\nBut as our technology of communication begins to create its own world and as we increasingly place ourselves inside that media world , we would do well to ask ourselves , `` At what point do we lose our essential nature as human beings ?\nOnce we 're jacked into the metaverse , are we still homo sapiens , or will we have become homo medias ?\nHave we considered what that means ?\nDo we care ? ''\nPerhaps it 's inevitable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has finally brought us here , to the black mirror at the doorway to the metaverse .\nPerhaps we were destined to end up here .\nPerhaps this is an expression of a fundamental urge that is part of human nature .\nPerhaps .\nBut it 's also good to know that this has an `` off '' button .\nThat the real world still exists .\nThat you are watching an image on a screen .\nAnd that the power to turn it all off is still in our hands .", "author": "James Corbett", "url": "https://www.corbettreport.com/metaverse/", "published": "Mon, 01 Aug 2022 22:17:02 +0000", "published_utc": 1659406622, "collection_utc": 1659395802}, {"id": "thecorbettreport--2022-08-03--A Mass Media Reading List -

Bush 's address to Congress on September 20 , 2001 : Some even believe that the war ended with Barack Obama 's declaration of May 23 , 2013 : But , as convenient as these statements are for creating bookends for the story of the war on terror , they do not tell the real story of that war .\nIn fact , the origins of the global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the general public has been led to believe .\nIn 1962 , the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , led by General Lyman Lemnitzer , issued a startling proposal to President John F. Kennedy on how to get the public on board with military invention in Cuba to remove Fidel Castro from power .\nCalled Operation Northwoods , the plan suggested a number of staged provocations , secretly committed by the US itself but blamed on Castro , including : blowing up a US ship in Guantanomo Bay and blaming the incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks in the United States to be blamed on Cuban terrorists ; and even painting up a remote-controlled plane to resemble a passenger jet and destroying it over Cuba .\nThe incredible plan , rejected by Kennedy , who subsequently refused to renew Lemnitzer 's term as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , was classified and was not revealed to the public until 2001 , just months before 9/11 .\nBut even after its rejection , the Northwoods idea of using spectacular terror attacks as the justification for a widescale war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn November 1998 , Philip Zelikow\u2014who would go on to chair the 9/11 Commission\u2014co-wrote an article in Foreign Affairs , the Council on Foreign Relations ' publication , with Ashton Carter , the future Secretary of Defense under President Obama , and John Deutsch , the former director of the CIA .\nTitled `` Catastrophic Terrorism : Tackling the New Danger , '' the article warns of a potential `` transforming event , '' such as an attack on the World Trade Center : The solution to this impending threat of catastrophic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is to take that threat seriously\u2014as the US government did in 1940 when it `` pondered what kind of forces it would need to wage a global war '' \u2014and to create new offices for coordinating homeland security and waging pre-emptive strikes against potential terrorists around the world .\nThen , unnoticed by much of the public , the global war on terror was first proposed on live TV on the morning of 9/11 .\nAt 11:28 AM New York time , as the blanket of dust from the freshly exploded towers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world was still trying to process what was happening , a guest on BBC World News laid out the dawning of the new age of global terror with remarkable foresight .\nBut this prediction was not delivered by a US government official or an American intelligence agent or a Washington Beltway insider .\nIt was delivered by Ehud Barak , the former Prime Minister of Israel .\nIn the chaos of September 11 , 2001 , mere minutes after the destruction of the Twin Towers , the global viewing public was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : that `` this is the time to deploy a globally concerted effort led by the United States '' ; that `` the world will not be the same from today on '' ; and , of course , that we `` do n't know who was responsible , '' although `` we will know in 12 hours . ''\nBut the name immediately implanted in the minds of the audience\u2014not for the first nor the last time on that long day of news coverage\u2014was that of Osama bin Laden .\nIn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking points for the US government and its allies around the world .\nBefore the day was over , President Bush was already laying the rhetorical groundwork for the coming war , vowing that `` we stand together to win the war against terrorism . ''\nBy the end of the week , the American public was being prepared for a conflict much bigger than a conventional war : `` This crusade , this war on terrorism is going to take a while . ''\nAnd , in the following week , Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the moment of the live televised strike on the World Trade Center : By the end of the month , the public had heard so many authoritative pronouncements about `` the evidence '' pointing to bin Laden 's responsibility for the 9/11 attacks that few noticed when the US government declined to release a promised white paper outlining that evidence\u2014a decision prompted by a `` lack of solid information '' about the plot , according to government sources cited by veteran journalist Seymour Hersh .\nInstead , the presentation of such evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in the global war on terror would be\u2014to a third-party nation-state : the United Kingdom .\nOn September 30 , 2001 , UK Prime Minister Tony Blair appeared on the BBC 's Breakfast with Frost program to declare he had been shown `` absolutely powerful , incontrovertible evidence of [ bin Laden 's ] link to the events of the 11th of September , '' but because the evidence came from `` sensitive sources '' he could not simply reveal it to the public .\nRather , the UK government would release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osama in great detail .\nThat dossier , titled `` Responsibility for the terrorist atrocities in the United States , '' was released on October 4th and was touted by the press as `` the clearest case yet of Osama bin Laden 's involvement in the September 11 attacks . ''\nThe document opens , however , by noting that it `` does not purport to provide a prosecutable case against Osama bin Laden in a court of law . ''\nThe first 60 points of the report provide general background information about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Al Qaeda , and the last ten points , dealing with `` Osama bin Laden and the 11 September attacks , '' are almost incomprehensibly vague .\nIt claims that `` at least three '' of the hijackers have been identified as `` associates of Al Qaeda , '' without listing how this conclusion was arrived at or even who these associates are .\nIt claims that the attack `` follows the modus operandi '' of Al Qaeda and is `` entirely consistent '' with the planning of previous attacks attributed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it states that `` [ t ] here is evidence of a very specific nature relating to the guilt of bin Laden and his associates that is too sensitive to release . ''\nAt almost the exact same time , momentous events were taking place in Europe , where the North Atlantic Council , NATO 's main decision-making body , was receiving a classified briefing from a US State Department operative .\nThis was no ordinary briefing .\nThe result of that briefing was that for the first time in its history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charter\u2014the self-defence clause that compels the organization to assist any member nation that is attacked by an outside force .\nBy `` proving '' that bin Laden had committed the attack in connection with the Taliban , the United States could launch the war on terror and compel NATO to assist in its invasion of Afghanistan .\nGiven the stakes involved , questions long swirled around this mysterious , classified briefing .\nWhat had Ambassador Frank Taylor told the North Atlantic Council that was so compelling ?\nWhat information persuaded the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch an invasion of another nation ?\nThe public , it seemed , would never know .\nBut then , in 2009 , intelwire.com quietly posted a document online under the title `` Secret Post-9/11 Briefing to World Leaders . ''\nThe document is a US State Department cable addressed to the American embassies in the NATO countries and American allies around the world under the subject line `` September 11 : Working together to fight the plague of global terrorism and the case against Al Qaeda . ''\nThe cable is dated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor 's meeting with the North Atlantic Council\u2014and instructs its recipients to brief their host country 's government on `` the information linking the Al Qaeda terrorist network , Osama bin Laden , and the Taliban regime to the September 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon and the crash of United Airlines Flight 93 . ''\nThe document went largely unnoticed until 2018 , when Professor Niels Harrit wrote an article , `` The Mysterious Frank Taylor Report : The 9/11 Document that Launched US-NATO \u2019 s 'War on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' connecting the dots between this document and the briefing that Ambassador Taylor gave to the North Atlantic Council .\nMuch like the UK government dossier , the State Department cable contains no actual evidence of a link between bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks .\nIn fact , the cable is virtually identical to the UK report .\nAfter spending a full fifteen pages talking in generalities about terror , about the US government 's officially sanctioned history of Al Qaeda , and of previous attacks attributed to Al Qaeda and Osama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at `` Part III '' purporting to demonstrate Al Qaeda 's involvement in the attacks .\nBut Part III begins by admitting that the investigation into the attacks is `` still in the early stage '' and that `` [ t ] here are still gaps in our knowledge . ''\nIt then goes on to detail circumstantial `` evidence , '' including the observation that `` bin Laden and his associates seemed to be anticipating what we could only identify as an important event or activity . ''\nFinally , the document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactically similar to earlier attacks '' because it involved planning and a desire to inflict mass casualties .\nAnd with that complete lack of evidence , the war on terror was launched and the invasion of Afghanistan began .\nAnd so , in October 2001 , the bombs began dropping on Afghanistan .\nThe war of terror had officially begun , and the public was told that one of the key objectives of that war was to kill or capture Osama bin Laden .\nBut as we have seen , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reign of terror was its agents ' uncanny ability to cross borders illegally , evade capture repeatedly and generally slip through intelligence agency dragnets unimpeded .\nThis remarkable string of `` good luck '' included : \u2022 the `` Blind Sheik '' Omar Abdel Rahman , who entered the US with CIA support and lived there unmolested even after his green card was revoked ; \u2022 World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef , who entered the US without the proper paperwork , working and living with a suspected terror ring that was under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he was even a person of interest in the WTC investigation ; \u2022 Khalid Al-Mihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi , whose entry to the US from an Al Qaeda summit in Malaysia was known about and actively covered up by the CIA and who lived openly in the United States under their real names for over a year , repeatedly calling the Al Qaeda communications hub in Yemen that was being monitored by the NSA ; \u2022 and , most infamously , Al Qaeda `` triple agent '' Ali Mohammed , whose career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` failed '' CIA asset , a trusted aide to Al Qaeda second-in-command Ayman Al-Zawahiri , a US special forces training officer , a volunteer fighter in Afghanistan , an FBI deep-cover asset , Osama bin Laden 's personal bodyguard and the trainer of many of Al Qaeda 's terrorists throughout the 1990s is so improbable that it is generally ignored in most histories of Al Qaeda .\nAs incredible as all of those stories are , however , they pale in comparison to the story that was about to unfold : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ostensibly the most wanted man on the planet , from under the noses of the American military and intelligence services .\nOsama bin Laden 's remarkable post-9/11 `` disappearance '' actually began on 9/11 itself , when his whereabouts were not a mystery to America or its allies in the region .\nIn fact , his location and activities on the night before 9/11 were well known to the US , although that information would not be revealed to the public until after his `` escape . ''\nDespite knowing bin Laden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the moment of 9/11 , however , and despite the fact that the Al Qaeda leader was already a wanted fugitive subject to international arrest warrants and under indictment by a US federal court , bin Laden continued to move around internationally with the full knowledge and complicity of state intelligence services .\nAnd , as remarkable as this may seem , bin Laden 's trip to Rawalpindi on the eve of 9/11 was neither the first nor the last time that the US would allow him to evade capture .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taliban offered to try bin Laden in Afghanistan or even hand him over to a third-party country if the US provided them with the same proof of Bin Laden 's guilt for 9/11 that Ambassador Taylor had supposedly provided NATO .\nBush turned the offer down .\nThen , after the invasion of Afghanistan began in October , the Taliban again tried to hand bin Laden over , this time dropping the request for proof of his guilt .\nBush again refused .\nThe war of terror , it turned out , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if bin Laden had been captured or killed , it would have derailed the carefully laid plans for the Bush Administration 's aggressive new foreign policy .\nBut , having been sold on the simplified version of the war on terror\u2014the one that held the objective of that war was to kill or capture Osama bin Laden and to liquidate the Al Qaeda network\u2014the public believed that the fighting would be short and decisive , like the first Gulf War .\nAfter all , how hard would it be for the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employing the tools of the most high-tech intelligence community in history to capture a lone fighter on dialysis in the caves of Tora Bora ?\nBush administration officials were quick to temper the public 's expectations on this point .\nThis was no ordinary elderly man living in an undefended cave , after all .\nThis was a comic book supervillain , an evil millionaire mastermind directing a terrorist army from his elaborate cave fortress .\nThis was a lie , of course .\nThere were no high-tech cave fortresses , no `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , '' no `` secret exits on the side , '' no ventilation system or computer systems .\nIt was a fabrication , a literal artist 's rendering with as much reality as that of a comic book or a cartoon .\nBut , as an unfolding drama for the public following the war on their television sets half a world away , this story had enough twists and turns to keep any audience engaged .\nThe first phase of the war went as predicted .\nBy November , America 's relentless bombing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from Kabul toward Kunduz in the north .\nThere , the trapped fighters\u2014including not only Taliban but Al Qaeda members as well as Pakistani Army officers , intelligence advisers , and volunteers\u2014were saved from certain defeat by a miracle : the arrival of a squadron of Pakistani aircraft that flew in and airlifted them back to Pakistan .\nIt was later confirmed that the operation\u2014dubbed the `` airlift of evil '' \u2014was signed off on by the Bush Administration , who had cut a secret deal with Pakistani President Musharraf to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States Central Command to set up a special air corridor to help insure the safety of the Pakistani rescue flights . ''\nBut what about Osama bin Laden ?\nAs it turns out , his whereabouts were no great mystery to American forces , and , once again , he was allowed to escape .\nOn the eve of the invasion of Afghanistan in October , the Guardian reported that `` Osama bin Laden was in Kabul last week and US and British intelligence agencies have a 'pretty good idea ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that `` Western intelligence has a much clearer picture of bin Laden 's recent movements than has been admitted . ''\nThe report went on to note that bin Laden 's `` capture or death would reduce the pressure for wider military action against Afghanistan . ''\nBut this intelligence did not lead to bin Laden 's apprehension .\nAs American forces honed in on Kabul in early November , bin Laden and all of his closest advisors managed to escape to Jalalabad in a very conspicuous late-night convoy .\nOne eyewitness reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were n't all killed the night before , because they came in a convoy of at least 1,000 cars and trucks .\nIt was a very dark night , but it must have been easy for American pilots to see the headlights . ''\nOn November 13th , just one day before the Northern Alliance captured Jalalabad , bin Laden escaped once again , this time in a convoy of several hundred cars .\nDespite believing bin Laden to be in one of the vehicles , US forces opted to ignore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airport .\nBin Laden and his men , now numbering a few hundred fighters , arrived in mid-November at the mountainous Khyber Pass on the border of Pakistan .\nOn November 15th , with the remaining Al Qaeda and Taliban holdouts pinned down in the caves of Tora Bora , the US military was in a position to eliminate the Al Qaeda threat , kill Osama bin Laden and end the war on terror .\nBut , remarkably , the Marines , special forces and CIA operatives who were positioned and ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their own superiors .\nThe story , exhaustively documented by CIA operatives , special forces operators , journalists and even a US Senate report , is clear and unambiguous .\nAs the US Senate report notes : `` By early December 2001 , bin Laden \u2019 s world had shrunk to a complex of caves and tunnels carved into a mountainous section of eastern Afghanistan known as Tora Bora . ''\nBoth the CIA and Delta Force\u2014the US Army 's elite special operations unit\u2014had tracked bin Laden from Jalalabad to Tora Bora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Al Qaeda almost from their arrival , allowing them to track movements and gauge the effectiveness of the bombing '' and were able to pick up radio communications featuring bin Laden directly issuing commands to his troops .\nThey had him surrounded on three sides , and the relentless air strikes\u2014including the use of a 15,000 pound `` daisy cutter '' not used since Vietnam\u2014were decimating what was left of bin Laden 's forces .\nAll that was needed was to secure the mountain pass leading out of Tora Bora and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the CIA 's paramilitary operation against the Taliban and Al Qaeda , knew that the Afghan militias that the US had cobbled together were not up to the job of securing the pass .\nFrom mid-November to mid-December , he repeatedly begged his superiors for one battalion of US Army Rangers\u2014just 800 troops\u2014to help stop bin Laden from slipping away .\nAs the US Senate later noted , fulfilling Berntsen 's request `` would have been a manageable task '' : General James Mattis , the commander of the Marines at Kandahar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could seal off Tora Bora , but his superiors rejected the plan .\nBerntsen fared no better in his quest to obtain 800 Army Rangers for the mission .\nNot only was his request rejected , but , remarkably , in the middle of the most important battle of the war , he was replaced as head of the CIA force in Afghanistan , effective immediately .\nHis replacement was to be Rich Blee , the same CIA bin Laden unit chief who had helped conceal the information about Al-Mihdhar and Alhazmi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBlee was accompanied to Afghanistan by Michael Anne Casey , the bin Laden unit staffer who had actually stopped Doug Miller from sharing that info with the FBI .\nAt first , Berntsen was told that his request was denied because it might `` alienate our Afghan allies . ''\n`` I do n't give a damn about alienating our allies ! ''\nhe replied .\n`` I only care about eliminating Al Qaeda and delivering bin Laden 's head in a box ! ''\nLater , though , a different story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the exact same time that bin Laden was holed up in Tora Bora , US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld ordered General Tommy Franks , who was leading the Afghan invasion , to redirect planning resources from Afghanistan to the Pentagon 's next target in the war of terror : Iraq .\nAs even the official story of the war on terror acknowledges , bin Laden and his top aides , seizing their opportunity , simply walked out of Tora Bora and into Pakistan .\nAnd , just like that , the bogeyman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allowed to escape yet again .\nHe would reappear from time to time to continue reminding the public about the origins of the terror war .\nBut now , the public 's attention was being turned to a new bogeyman .\nThat the Bush Administration would pivot so quickly from hunting Osama bin Laden to toppling Saddam Hussein was only surprising to those who did not know the neocons populating the Bush administration or their well-documented and long-held desire to affect regime change in Iraq .\nIn 1996 , a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and David Wurmser\u2014wrote a report for then-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .\nTitled `` A Clean Break : A New Strategy for Securing the Realm , '' the report urged Israel to `` shape its strategic environment '' by `` weakening , containing , and even rolling back Syria . ''\nThe way to do this , the report concluded , was to `` focus on removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq\u2014an important Israeli strategic objective in its own right\u2014as a means of foiling Syria \u2019 s regional ambitions . ''\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go on to serve in the Bush Administration , and even Jeb Bush , the future president 's brother\u2014signed a `` Statement of Principles '' as the founding charter of a new think tank called the Project for the New American Century ( PNAC ) .\nThe statement called on then-President Clinton to reverse the defense spending cuts that marked the post-Cold War era and to `` increase defense spending significantly . ''\nIn 1998 , the group followed up with an open letter to Clinton urging him to `` turn your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for removing Saddam 's regime from power . ''\nSurrounding himself with neocons on the campaign trail and eventually installing those neocons in all of the key security positions in his cabinet , President George W. Bush wasted no time in making these regime change dreams a reality .\nAs Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill later revealed , at his first major national security council meeting\u2014held just ten days into the new administration\u2014 '' President Bush tasked Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Hugh Shelton to begin preparing options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the northern and southern no-fly zones in Iraq to support an insurgency to bring down the Saddam regime . ''\nThe second national security council meeting of the Bush administration , held two days later , also discussed regime change in Iraq , with one briefing document at the meeting marked `` secret '' and bearing the title `` Plan for post-Saddam Iraq . ''\nAnd , infamously , on the day of 9/11 itself , the administration was already beginning plans for a retaliatory strike not just on bin Laden in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken at 2:40 PM on September 11 , 2001 , records Rumsfeld saying he wanted `` best info fast .\nJudge whether good enough to hit Saddam Hussein at the same time .\nNot only bin Laden . ''\nHe also made sure to order staff to `` go massive '' and `` sweep it all up '' including `` things related and not . ''\nFrom before Bush even got into office , there was no doubt that he would attack Iraq .\n9/11 and the war on terror merely presented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that agenda .\nThe only problem was how to tie Iraq into the war on terror in the minds of the public , a problem that Bush himself admitted to .\nThe job of connecting the public face of the war on terror\u2014bin Laden and Al Qaeda\u2014to Saddam and Iraq was made more difficult by the fact that there was no such connection .\nDifficult , but not impossible , for a committed cadre with no qualms about using mendacity to achieve their political objectives .\nThe most direct link between Al Qaeda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta was reported to have made to the Iraqi consulate in Prague in April 2001 .\nAfter Atta 's pictures were published in the media in the wake of 9/11 , a Middle East informant told Czech intelligence that he had seen Atta meeting with a suspected Iraqi intelligence agent in the Czech Republic that spring .\nThe story became even more salacious when\u2014at the height of the anthrax scare in October 2001\u2014 '' anonymous Israeli intelligence sources '' planted a story in the German media that Atta had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact in Prague .\nBut the entire story was such a preposterous lie that it was quickly disowned by both the FBI and the CIA .\nInvestigators found `` there was no evidence Atta left or returned to the US '' during that time frame and `` pointed to other evidence , including Atta 's cell phone records , to cast doubt on the idea that any meeting had occurred . ''\nAnd , despite the fantastical , anonymous , evidence-free reports in German media , the anthrax used in the anthrax attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not source from Iraq , but from the US military 's own bioweapons laboratory .\nNone of this stopped Vice President Dick Cheney from repeating the lie in his media appearances in the run-up to the Iraq War , however .\nThe story of Iraqi agents handing flasks of anthrax to 9/11 hijackers was a little too fanciful even for the credulous American public , however , and it was soon dropped from the neocons ' sales pitch for the Iraq war .\nInstead , a different set of lies would need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the illegal invasion of a sovereign nation .\nOn January 31 , 2003\u2014six months after senior British intelligence complained behind closed doors that the `` facts were being fixed around the policy '' of invading Iraq\u2014Bush met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair at the White House for a discussion on the matter .\nAs a now-infamous memo documenting the meeting records , Bush had already decided on military action , and a start date for the bombing of March 10th `` was now pencilled in . ''\nGiven that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution authorizing the invasion absent some compelling incident , Bush suggested a way that Iraq could be provoked into aggressive action .\nAccording to the memo : `` The US was thinking of flying U2 reconnaissance aircraft with fighter cover over Iraq , painted in UN colours .\nIf Saddam fired on them , he would be in breach '' of existing UN resolutions , thus justifying military action .\nThe stunning and documented admission that President Bush had suggested staging a false flag event as one option for provoking a war received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has since largely been forgotten .\nAfter all , they did not need to get Iraq to shoot down a spy plane .\nThe neocons had hit on a different strategy for selling the war to the public .\nAs decades of after-the-fact journalism has exhaustively documented , every aspect of the `` Weapons of Mass Destruction '' story was a transparent and admitted lie .\nBut it was a remarkably successful lie .\nSix months into the Iraq war , a stunning 82 % of the American public believed that Saddam Hussein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bin Laden and Al Qaeda , and 69 % believed that Saddam was personally involved in the September 11th attacks .\nAs the months wore on , however , it became harder to hide the fact that the mythical WMD stashes and mobile weapons labs and aluminum tubes that the public had been assured were keys to the `` imminent threat '' posed by Saddam 's regime simply were n't there .\nEven the corporate press that had worked so hard to sell these lies to the public had to start pointing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lied in order to sell an illegal invasion of a sovereign country to the American public and to the people of the world .\nThe neocons realized that a renewed effort was going to be needed to connect Iraq to the war on terror in order to keep the public on board with the war as the invasion of Iraq morphed into the occupation of Iraq .\nAnd , as always , the Al Qaeda threat would serve the purpose of terrifying the public into rallying once again behind their government .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortal enemies might have been an insurmountable obstacle to anyone concerned with the truth .\nBut these were neocons .\nTheir logic was simple : if the Al Qaeda bogeyman did n't exist in Iraq , they would have to create it .\nSo that 's exactly what they did .\nFounded in Jordan in 1999 , even the official history of the terrorist organization that became known as `` Al Qaeda in Iraq '' acknowledges that the group originally had nothing to do with either Al Qaeda or Iraq .\nInstead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Jordanian militant whose terror cell Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad , or `` Congregation of Monotheism and Jihad , '' was dedicated to the overthrow of the Jordanian monarchy .\nLike many of the figures in the Al Qaeda story , the biography of al-Khalaylah is not that of a devout Muslim , let alone a dedicated jihadi .\nA high school dropout , al-Khalaylah was known for drunken brawls and drug dealing and was jailed for sexual assualt before going to Afghanistan to join the Mujahideen in 1989 , just as the Soviets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of this soon-to-be-feared terrorist leader tells us he returned to Jordan `` a few years later , '' founded a terror cell known as Jund al-Sham that attracted the attention of the authorities , and was sent to prison in 1992 where he `` adopted more radical Islamic beliefs . ''\nAfter his release from the Jordanian prison in 1999 , he immediately became involved in a new plot to bomb the Radisson SAS Hotel in Amman and several tourist sites in Jordan just before New Year 's Day 2000 .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Pakistan to Afghanistan , where , we are told , he met with bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders , with whose assistance he set up a terrorist training camp for Jordanian militants in Herat .\nJoining the resistance to the US invasion after 9/11 and adopting the nom de guerre Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , he fled to Iran in January 2002 .\nHis whereabouts and activities during 2002 are `` difficult to pin down '' but `` Western and Arab intelligence agencies '' assured The Washington Post that , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by numerous governments , Zarqawi , like many other Al Qaeda figures , `` moved frequently and with relative ease among Iran , Syria , Lebanon and Iraq , expanding his network . ''\nThen , in 2003 , still a relative unknown even within the world of militant jihad , Zarqawi turned up in Baghdad , where he was catapulted to international infamy not by his actions , nor by the promotion of Osama bin Laden or other jihadis , but by the US government .\nThe remarks , delivered during Colin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion of Iraq to the UN Security Council in February of 2003 , were\u2014like most of the specific accusations in the address\u2014demonstrably false .\nZarqawi was a relative nobody in Iraq at the time ; the CIA later admitted there was no evidence that Hussein had been `` harboring '' him ; and his group was not , in fact , affiliated with Al Qaeda when Powell made his speech .\nNevertheless , these falsehoods started to become true after the spotlight of attention was showered on Zarqawi by the US State Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zarqawi were relatively few , but received inordinate amounts of attention from the international press .\nThese attacks were often designed to inflame Shia/Sunni hatred , thus turning resistance to the occupation into a full-on sectarian conflict that tore the country to its roots .\nAnd in 2004 , Zarqawi\u2014who , we are told , calculated that attaching the Al Qaeda brand name to his group would give it more cach\u00e9 in the jihadi world\u2014pledged his allegiance to Osama bin Laden and received the Al Qaeda title `` Emir of Al Qaeda in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The specter of Al Qaeda in Iraq\u2014just another cynical and calculated lie when used by Powell to justify the Iraq invasion\u2014had become a reality .\nWhat resulted from this US government-promoted character was a career so remarkable that it could only be believed in a Hollywood action movie .\n.\n.\nor a history of Al Qaeda .\nIn 2004 , after being allegedly caught and freed by Iraqi security forces in the Fallujah area because `` they did n't realize who he was , '' Zarqawi was then reportedly killed in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March before pledging his allegiance to Osama and officially joining Al Qaeda in October .\nIn 2005 , Zarqawi was , according to various sources : arrested in Baakuba in January ; left `` seriously injured , possibly dead '' after a US-led offensive in May ; evacuated to a neighbouring country `` with the help of doctors from the Arab Peninsula and the Sudan '' ; killed in fighting in Ramadi in June and buried in Fallujah ; and killed again in a terrorist bombing in Mosul in November .\nThis remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we were told , Zarqawi had been killed yet again ( and presumably for good ) in June of 2006 .\nBut not everyone believed that this final account of Zarqawi 's death was the true one .\nRather than simply mistakes in reporting , other members of the Iraqi resistance insisted that Zarqawi had in fact been killed early on in the US invasion and that his name was simply being used to create an excuse for the continued American occupation of the country .\nSheikh Jawad Al-Khalessi , a noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Le Monde as saying : Al-Khalessi was not the only one with his doubts about Zarqawi 's true nature .\nThe Project on Defense Alternatives of the Commonwealth Institute in Massachusetts released a report in 2004 excoriating the US government for its propaganda attempting to portray Zarqawi as a terrorist leader in Iraq : Similarly , The Financial Times , The Telegraph , Knight Ridder Newspapers , The Los Angeles Times and Newsweek all published stories in 2004 calling various aspects of the Zarqawi myth into question .\nA report in The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figurehead around whom dissident groups in Iraq were rallying , rather than an elusive fighter directing military operations , '' noting that `` the more the Americans blamed al-Zarqawi for terrorist atrocities , the greater his credibility on the Arab street , '' and quoting an `` unnamed Sunni insurgent leader '' as calling Zarqawi `` an American , Israeli and Iranian agent who is trying to keep our country unstable so that the Sunnis will keep facing occupation . ''\nAccording to The Atlantic , even Osama bin Laden himself `` suspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom al-Zarqawi had been granted amnesty [ in 1998 ] had been infiltrated by Jordanian intelligence . ''\nAnd then , right before he was reported dead for the last time , skeptics of the Zarqawi narrative were proven right in a remarkable fashion .\nOn April 9 , 2004 , The Washington Post published proof in the form of internal military documents that the US government had played up the myth of Zarqawi and Al Qaeda in Iraq as part of a psychological operations campaign : In case there was any doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans , the program included the Pentagon `` selectively leaking '' a letter to a US reporter purported to be written by Zarqawi and boasting of his role in the wave of suicide attacks terrorizing Iraq .\nThe letter was dutifully covered by The New York Times even though there were serious questions about whether it was real at all .\nThe Washington Post expos\u00e9 quotes an internal briefing document produced by US military headquarters in Iraq revealing that US military chief spokesman Brig .\nGen. Mark Kimmitt boasted that `` [ t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most successful information campaign to date . ''\nAnd then , two months after these explosive revelations , Zarqawi was reported dead for the last time , a character written out of the script once his value as a propaganda construct was exhausted .\nWith Zarqawi out of the picture , something else would would be required to keep the American public , and the people of the world , invested in the War on Terror .\nThe main villain in the battle would have to return .\nThankfully for the US government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to oblige .\nFrom the time of his miraculous `` escape '' from Tora Bora on , the outside world only knew Osama bin Laden from his occasional video releases .\nThe most infamous of these productions was a video released to the public by the US Defense Department on December 13 , 2001 .\nSupposedly `` obtained in Afghanistan during the search of a private home in Jalalabad '' after anti-Taliban forces moved in to the city , the tape , we are told , `` bore a label indicating it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` shows bin Laden sitting on the floor in a bare room in a house in Kandahar '' with `` several other men , including two aides and an unidentified cleric , or Sheikh . ''\nMost importantly , it contains\u2014according to the Pentagon-provided subtitles that were added to the video before its distribution to the press\u2014bin Laden 's confession to planning the 9/11 attacks .\n`` We had notification since the previous Thursday that the event would take place that day , '' the US government translation has bin Laden saying .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of casualties from the enemy who would be killed based on the position of the tower . ''\nThe press release provided by the Pentagon noted that , due to the poor quality of the tape , they were not able to produce a verbatim transcript , but that their translation `` does convey the messages and information flow '' of the conversation , an answer that was apparently good enough for the White House press corps .\nBut this answer was not sufficient for the foreign press .\nThe following week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edition of their investigate program , `` Monitor , '' in which they hired their own independent translators to check the Pentagon 's transcript of the tape .\nThe report calls the Pentagon translation `` very problematic , '' noting that `` at the most important places where it is held to prove the guilt of bin Laden , it is not identical with the Arabic . ''\nTranslator Dr. Murad Alami , for instance , found that in the sentence `` We calculated in advance the number of casualties from the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' had simply been inserted by the US government translators .\nThose words did not appear on the tape .\nSimilarly , the word `` previous '' in `` We had notification since the previous Thursday , '' was never said , and the subsequent statement that an event would take place on that day can not be heard in the original Arabic version .\nThe Monitor report concludes that the Pentagon translation of Osama bin Laden 's supposed confession tape\u2014deliberately adding words in key passages to make it sound like a confession\u2014was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Gernot Rotter , a professor of Islamic and Arabic Studies at the Asia-Africa Institute at the University of Hamburg , states in the report : `` The American translators who listened to the tapes and transcribed them apparently wrote a lot of things in that they wanted to hear but that can not be heard on the tape no matter how many times you listen to it . ''\nThe startling revelation that the Osama bin Laden confession tape was not a confession tape at all\u2014aired on Germany 's premiere public broadcaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never reported in the US .\nThat video was followed in short order by a 30-minute video of a visibly gaunt and graying Osama bin Laden delivering what appears to be a last message to the Arab world .\nReleased on December 27 , 2001 , and presumably recorded during the fight at Tora Bora , bin Laden comments on his own mortality : `` God willing , America 's end is near .\nAnd it does n't depend on my continued existence .\nWhether Osama is killed or not , the awakening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video , bin Laden does not move his left arm at all and appears visibly weak .\nInterested at that moment in turning the public 's attention away from Osama bin Laden and toward the next front in the War on Terror , Iraq , the Bush administration dismissed the video as `` sick propaganda possibly designed to mask the fact the Al Qaeda leader was already dead . ''\n`` He could have made the video and then ordered that it be released in the event of his death , '' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying .\n`` The guy is trying to show he 's untouched by the US bombing but he looks under pressure to me . ''\nRecorded months after his reported journey to Rawalpindi for kidney dialysis , this video would not be the first or the last time that Osama bin Laden would be reported as dead or dying .\nLike Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , bin Laden was also reported dead on several occasions in the ensuing years , including : \u2022 on December 26 , 2001 , when it was reported that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious lung complication in Tora Bora ; \u2022 on January 18 , 2002 , when Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf told CNN : `` I think now , frankly , he is dead for the reason he is a .\n.\n.\nkidney patient '' ; \u2022 in September 2006 , when French intelligence leaked a report suggesting bin Laden had died of typhoid fever in Pakistan ; \u2022 and in March 2009 , when former US foreign intelligence officer Angelo Codevilla stated : \u201c All the evidence suggests Elvis Presley is more alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also like Zarqawi , none of these reported deaths stopped the Osama bin Laden character from reappearing on the TV screens of a traumatized public to remind them of the importance of the ongoing war on terror .\nWhat followed in the ensuing years was a series of video and audio releases of questionable provenance , often reported in carefully worded turns of phrase that gave the press plausible deniability as to whether or not the recordings really were of Osama bin Laden .\nA message aired on Al Jazeera in February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the BBC as `` a poor quality audio recording in which a man 's voice , identified as bin Laden 's , is heard calling for suicide attacks against Americans and resistance to any attack on Iraq . ''\nThe recordings were often mundane .\nAn April 2006 audio message of a speaker `` believed to be Osama bin Laden '' called on Muslims to `` prepare for a long war '' in Sudan .\nA January 2010 audio message warned of the dangers of climate change .\n`` Talk about climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reality , '' the speaker , purportedly bin Laden , told his fellow jihadis .\nOther recordings appeared at opportune times for the planners of the war on terror , catapulting the terror threat back into the public consciousness just when questions about that narrative were beginning to emerge .\nThe 2004 US presidential election contest between George Bush and John Kerry , for instance , featured an unusual `` October surprise '' : a new Osama bin Laden videotape in which the terror mastermind appears to claim responsibility for 9/11 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes .\nAnd then again , in September 2007 , just days before General David Petraeus was set to deliver his report to Congress on the controversial `` surge '' in Iraq and just days before the sixth anniversary of 9/11 , there was Osama bin Laden to remind the public of the ever-present terror threat .\nCapitalizing on the conveniently timed video release , President Bush was quick to cite it as evidence that Al Qaeda was connected to the war in Iraq and that the increasingly unpopular war\u2014now generally understood to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false pretenses\u2014was in fact an essential part of the war on terror .\nBut buried beneath the attention-grabbing headlines and substance-less soundbites with which the media covered this release , troubling questions began to arise about the nature of the video .\nThe aging , weary , gaunt , graying and partially paralyzed Osama bin Laden of 2001 was gone , replaced by a visibly younger and healthier man , despite having numerous health problems and despite having presumably spent the better part of a decade on the run as the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and what many media commentators pointed out looked like a fake beard , the figure on the screen seems to be moving in an unrealistic way .\nBizarrely , the video freezes at the 1-minute-and-58-second mark while the audio continues .\nThe image remains frozen for most of the video message , only resuming briefly around the 12-minute mark .\nWhat 's more , all of the references to current events\u2014those parts referenced in passing on the evening news as `` proving that Osama is still alive '' \u2014take place during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , the video proved so unusual that media commentators had to go out of their way to assure their viewers that it was indeed real .\nPerhaps the strangest part of the video , however , was the manner in which it was released to the public .\nThe video , it turns out , was not released by Al Qaeda , but by the US government .\nThe month after the video 's release it was reported that the video had originally been `` intercepted '' by SITE Intelligence Group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , commercial intelligence firms that specialize in intercepting al-Qaeda 's internet communications , often by clandestine means . ''\nAccording to The Washington Post : It was not explained how SITE had `` obtained an early copy '' of an Osama bin Laden video , but it was far from the only time that mysteriously well-connected internet researchers had unexplained exclusive access to Al Qaeda video productions .\nResearchers and companies who supposedly scooped the intelligence agencies by `` discovering '' and publishing Al Qaeda messages ( sometimes even ahead of Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the `` Search for International Terrorist Entities , '' whose promotional materials touted the company 's `` one-of-a-kind access '' to `` messages , videos , and advance warnings of suicide bombings '' from `` the most hard-to-reach corners of violent online extremist communities , '' whose clientele included leading media outlets and even government agencies , and whose founder , Rita Katz , was born in Iraq to a wealthy Jewish businessman father who was convicted of spying for Israel in 1969 in a military tribunal and executed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told , Katz did not think had much bearing on her work ) and who , despite not having any intelligence connections herself , found a job allowing her to search for terrorists online shortly after moving to New York in the 1990s ; \u2022 `` Laura Mansfield , '' a pseudonymous South Carolina housewife who\u2014despite being a self-described `` mom sitting here in her dining room typing away on my computer '' \u2014is fluent in Arabic , who likes to `` monitor '' jihadi message boards and chat rooms , and who\u2014with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of terror or espionage\u2014was consistently able to find and publicize Al Qaeda videos before anyone else , including : a `` 2007 '' video of Osama bin Laden that , it was quickly discovered , was actually a five-year-old video that had already been previously released but reported as `` new '' by the credulous mainstream press ; and multiple releases featuring `` Azzam the American , '' a.k.a .\nAdam Pearlman , the Jewish Californian whose grandfather was a board member of the Anti-Defamation League and who , we are told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet post and was quickly recruited by Al Qaeda to serve as `` translator , video producer , and cultural interpreter '' for their media committee ; \u2022 and IntelCenter , a company described as `` a private contractor working for intelligence agencies '' and headed by Ben Venzke\u2014the former Director of Intelligence Special Projects at iDefense , where he worked alongside people like Jim Melnick , a psychological operations specialist who served sixteen years in the US Army and the Defense Intelligence Agency\u2014that similarly supplied the US government and media with Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror group 's media production arm , and somehow exclusively obtained by this private contractor in Virginia .\nThe public had good reason to question the reality of these suspiciously timed and mysteriously sourced audio and video recordings .\nIn 1999 , William Arkin wrote a piece for The Washington Post called `` When Seeing and Hearing Is n't Believing '' in which he reported on the digital morphing technologies that were then being worked on by research teams at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and elsewhere .\nHe reported on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gen. Carl W. Steiner , former Commander-in-Chief , US Special Operations Command , announcing `` Gentlemen !\nWe have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the United States government . ''\nThe fake audio was so impressive that General Steiner asked for a copy .\nAnother demonstration involved Colin Powell announcing that he was being well treated by his captors .\nThe technology continued to feature in PSYOPS planning as the war of terror dragged on .\nIn 2003 , the CIA Iraq Operations Group came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for discrediting Saddam Hussein in the eyes of his people : to create a video purporting to show the Iraqi dictator having sex with a teenage boy .\nAmazingly , Stein also confirmed that the CIA did make a fake video of Osama bin Laden : But as successful as these information operations and Al Qaeda media releases were in keeping the terror threat in the minds of the public , the neocons directing this war of terror were going to need much more than that to meet their objectives .\nThe war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waged in Iraq , was never meant to end there .\nBut getting the public\u2014already weary of the years-long struggle in Afghanistan and increasingly disillusioned with the debacle in Iraq\u2014on board with the invasion of yet another country was going to be difficult unless another spectacular terror event came along to justify opening up yet another front in the war on terror .\nAnd , if the terror bogeyman was not willing to provide such a justification , the neocons were once again ready and willing to create it .\nSeymour Hersh was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of the Bush White House staging a terror event in the waning days of its administration to trigger a bold new escalation with Iran .\nEven Zbigniew Brzezinski\u2014whose involvement in Operation Cyclone started the American involvement in Afghanistan that led to the creation of Al Qaeda in the first place\u2014warned the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2007 that a military provocation or terrorist act whose origin `` would be very difficult to trace '' could be staged and blamed on Tehran in order to justify US military action on Iran .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounting domestic difficulties and the ramifications of a global financial crisis\u2014no longer had the political capital to stage terror events and garner public approval for their agenda .\nBy 2008

getting tired .\nThey did n't want the neocons and their endless war on terror .\nThey were hoping for change .\nLuckily for them , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to offer .\nThe public was ready for change .\nIn fact , the idea of a shift from the bellicose , belligerent , aggressive foreign policy and the war on terror rhetoric of the neocons to the promised hope and change of the Obama administration was so enticing that not only did Obama win the 2008 election , he also won over the world at large .\nSo excited were people for the prospect of peace that the Nobel Peace Prize committee decided to bestow their 2009 prize on Obama before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in office .\nThose not swept up in the hope and change delirium were quick to point out that the committee had made a mistake in handing a peace prize to a president still actively involved in military engagements .\nWhat not even his most cynical critics seemed prepared for , however , was the idea that Obama would not only continue the Bush administration 's war on terror but that he would greatly expand it .\nFrom the two-front war in Afghanistan and Iraq under Bush , Obama would ultimately lead the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of Obama 's first moves in office was to oversee a dramatic escalation in Afghanistan , a `` troop surge '' that was meant to resolve the security issues in the country but actually exacerbated them , finally leading to the dramatic downfall of the US-backed regime and the reinstallation of the Taliban in 2021 .\nAnd , as we shall see , despite promising a swift resolution to the war in Iraq , not only was the handover of authority to the Iraqi government delayed as long as legally possible but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the terror group that they fostered led to a battle against the Islamic State .\nBut the newly revitalized war on terror\u2014now given new cover by a smiling , peace-prizing-winning , softer-spoken Commander-in-Chief\u2014did not end there .\nObama oversaw the expansion of Bush 's drone war into Pakistan : He led the `` kinetic military action '' in Libya against previous war on terror ally Moammar Gaddafi : He began the decade-long attempt to overthrow previous war on terror ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria : He waged war in Yemen along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fostered terror groups in the region for years : And he extended the `` Authorization for Use of Military Force '' \u2014the legislation passed in the wake of 9/11 authorizing the president to `` use all necessary and appropriate force '' against those nations , organizations or persons he determines `` planned , authorized , committed or aided '' that attack\u2014to include Al-Shabaab in Somalia .\nBut although these escalations appeared to be a mere continuation of the War on Terror that was sold to the public in the wake of 9/11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it quickly became apparent that a remarkable transition had begun to occur .\nAl Qaeda , the ultimate face of evil and the undisputed enemy in the grand terror war narrative , were now the `` good guys '' \u2014or at least serviceable allies\u2014in the fight against the next target in the war of terror .\nThis unbelievable turnaround had in fact begun during the Bush administration , when the neocons had started to set their sites on Iran .\nBeing predominately Shiite , Iran is in fact the enemy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ranks of Al Qaeda and other Sunni terror groups .\nIn targeting Iran , the US\u2014like the British Empire before them\u2014found it convenient to switch allegiances , arming , funding and promoting the very radicals they had just been at war with in order to defeat their enemy of the moment .\nAs Hersh detailed in his articles on `` The Redirection '' and `` Preparing the Battlefield , '' and as other mainstream sources eventually corroborated , this `` shift in Middle East strategy '' by the Bush administration included : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force led by a `` former associate of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi '' dedicated to `` spreading the ideology of Al Qaeda '' \u2014in their struggle against Iranian ally ( and Israeli enemy ) Hezbollah ; \u2022 providing covert funds to the Mujahedin-e-Khalq , a strange cult-of-personality that , as a violent group of radicals that participated in bombings inside Iran and even aided Mossad in assassinating Iranian scientists , was not merely lauded by the US but openly promoted at gala events by neocons and their fellow-travellers ; \u2022 secretly backing `` opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iran 's most important regional allies ; \u2022 and `` supplying money and weapons '' to Jundullah , a group with `` close ties to Al Qaeda '' ( including reportedly being at one time headed by alleged `` 9/11 mastermind '' Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ) that `` conducted raids into Iran from bases in Pakistan '' with covert CIA assistance .\nThat these operations would have started under Bush and the neocons came as little surprise to those who knew anything about the real nature of the so-called war on terror .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanded under Obama , the Ambassador of Hope and Change , was more surprising to those who did not yet grasp the true scale and scope of this war .\nNo , the substance of the Bush redirection did not change under Obama , only the tone and flavour of that policy changed .\nObama did not win multiple advertising awards for his 2008 Hope and Change election campaign for nothing .\nAs a shrewd salesman of an unpopular agenda , he knew that to get the public on board with such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to need an equally radical event to take place to tie a bow on the Osama bin Laden narrative and redirect the public 's attention .\nAnd , on May 2 , 2011 , that event occurred .\nCodenamed Operation Neptune Spear , the mission to kill bin Laden involved a daring team of Navy SEALs flying two stealth-modified Black Hawk helicopters from the Jalalabad military base in Afghanistan through Pakistani air space straight to Abbottabad\u2014the affluent military town where the world 's most wanted man had evidently been living for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history .\nCrash landing one of the choppers in the compound courtyard , a massive firefight broke out .\nThe SEALs , clearing weapons stashes and barricades while fending off bin Laden 's henchmen , made their way to the third-floor bedroom where the dastardly villain used one of his wives as a human shield .\nShooting her in the leg to get her out of the way , the SEALs then managed to land two shots on their target , one hitting bin Laden in the head and the other in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the gun he kept at the ready by his headboard .\nMaking good their escape , the Navy SEAL heroes blew up their damaged helicopter while a standby chopper that had been prepared for the mission in case of an emergency flew in and whisked the remaining task force members out with bin Laden 's body in tow .\nReturning to Bagram Air Base , bin Laden 's body was immediately flown out to the USS Carl Vinson , where it was buried at sea in accordance with Islamic tradition .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPublic Enemy number one , the face of the war on terror , was dead ; slain by the valiant Navy SEALs in a daring operation that was broadcast in real time to the White House Situation Room , where the Commander-in-Chief of the War of Terror , Barack Obama , and his iron-willed cabinet of terror warriors watched with steely determination .\nIndeed , this was not the stuff of history books , no dry , dusty tale of some minor police action or military operation .\nIt may not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortress that the public had been prepared for , but\u2014befitting the comic book supervillain of the war on terror narrative\u2014this was the stuff of Hollywood blockbusters .\nYes , this was the stuff of Hollywood blockbusters .\nBut , like a Hollywood blockbuster , the story of the raid was itself fiction .\nIn fact , in the face of mild questioning by the generally deferential press , every single aspect of the confusing and often contradictory story that was told to the public in those euphoric hours after Obama 's momentous announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There had been no firefight .\nHe did not use his wife as a human shield .\nBurial at sea was not part of Islamic tradition .\nIn fact , it was directly opposed to that tradition .\nEven the famous picture from the Situation Room was a lie ; there had been no live video feed of the raid .\nBut it was n't just the details of the raid itself that had been a fabrication ; the entire story of the decade-long manhunt for Osama , dramatized in Oscar-winning movies like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports , books and tell-alls , proved to be similarly fraudulent .\nIn fact , the story began to fall apart from the very moment it was told to the public .\nBut while most of the press remained content to pick at the corners of the story , leaving the substance of the narrative intact , others dug deeper , looking for answers amid the confusing confluence of lies , obfuscations , cover-ups and contradictions that surrounded the raid .\nIn a lengthy article for The London Review of Books in 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no direct knowledge of the events recounted\u2014was about as solidly sourced as the official account , Seymour Hersh alleged that , while bin Laden had indeed been killed in Abbottabad , he had in fact been living at the compound as a prisoner of the ISI for years and that every part of the official narrative of the raid\u2014from the story of the `` Al Qaeda courier '' by which the CIA allegedly discovered the compound to the phony vaccination drive to collect bin Laden 's DNA to the burial at sea\u2014was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seemingly unnecessary ) cover story to obscure that fact .\nIn a piece for The Independent the year after the raid , Patrick Cockburn pointed out the inherent contradiction between early reports that the raid had uncovered a `` treasure trove '' of intelligence that `` portrayed bin Laden as a spider at the centre of a conspiratorial web '' and later admissions that he had had almost no contact with the outside world and was increasingly delusional about his organization and its capabilities .\nOthers simply pointed out that , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which journalists , politicians , intelligence officials or others had pronounced Osama bin Laden dead , it was not to be believed without evidence .\nBut that evidence was not forthcoming .\nInstead , the government went to extraordinary lengths to cover it up .\nAll the files from the raid\u2014including `` copies of the death certificate and autopsy report for bin Laden as well as the results of tests to identify the body '' \u2014were deleted from the Pentagon 's computers and transferred to the CIA , where they could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act requests .\nPictures and video of the raid , including pictures of Osama bin Laden 's dead body that\u2014the public were told\u2014may be released , were instead sealed away forever .\nAt the time , all that was released were a few short videos of a man purported to be Osama bin Laden that\u2014it was claimed\u2014had been taken from the compound ( although it was never explained why bin Laden would have poorly shot video of his back to the camera , watching himself on TV ) and some salacious details about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's computers\u2014like the devout Muslim jihadi 's predilection for porn\u2014that seemed reminiscent of the CIA 's previous `` wacky ideas '' for faking videos about Hussein and bin Laden .\nBut CIA director Leon Panetta did leak classified details of the raid at a 2011 award ceremony attended by Mark Boal , the screenwriter who would go on to write and produce Zero Dark Thirty , the Hollywood dramatization of the manhunt for Osama that portrayed the official version of the raid on the silver screen and even falsely implied that the CIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in helping to track down the terror kingpin .\nThe full truth of what happened in Abbottabad , now obscured by lies , misinformation , selective `` leaks , '' self-serving tell-alls and still-classified data will likely never see the light of day .\nBut to the directors of the War of Terror , that is beside the point .\nOsama bin Laden had served his purpose as the villain in the terror war story .\nAnd , having served that purpose , he was being written out of the script .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bin Laden had ever been : a character in the terror war drama .\nOne so good that , if he did n't exist , they would have had to invent him .\nThe death of Osama bin Laden may have ended one chapter in the War on Terror , but it was not the end of the story .\nIn a key sense , that story would simply repeat , with the rise of Al Qaeda serving as a template that the terror war planners could draw upon as needed in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe alignment with radical Islamists to achieve short-term geostrategic goals\u2014a strategy refined by the British Empire over centuries of practice in the `` Great Game '' of global geopolitics and reaching its apotheosis with the US operation to arm the Afghan Mujahideen in the 1980s\u2014was simply employed once again as the US led its NATO allies in a `` humanitarian war '' against Moammar Gaddafi in Libya .\nFormer enemies in the war on terror , including veterans of the Iraq insurgency who had been killing American troops in Iraq , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tortured by the CIA , were now the good guys , helping to overthrow Gaddafi 's government in Tripoli .\nThat same story played out yet again in Syria , where the US and its regional allies once again made a deal with the devil , this time in the name of toppling the government of Bashar al-Assad .\nArming the most radical elements of these terror groups with US-procured weapons and training them at a US joint operation base in Jordan , it was not long before the Bush-era `` redirection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Al Qaeda was now widely recognized as a convenient ally of the US in Syria .\nIn 2012 , Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) Senior Fellow Ed Husain wrote of `` Al-Qaeda 's Specter in Syria , '' noting that `` The Syrian rebels would be immeasurably weaker today without Al Qaeda in their ranks . ''\nIn 2014 , a trio of foreign policy `` experts '' published a piece for the CFR on `` The Good and Bad of Ahrar al-Sham : An Al Qaeda\u2013Linked Group Worth Befriending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mendelsohn\u2014writing in the pages of the same Foreign Affairs magazine in which Philip Zelikow and his co-authors had `` predicted '' the terror war\u2014penned `` Accepting Al Qaeda : The Enemy of the United States ' Enemy , '' in which he argued : In conclusion , Mendelson writes flatly : `` It is certainly ironic that at this point , when the United States is the closest it has ever been to destroying Al Qaeda , its interests would be better served by keeping the terrorist organization afloat and Zawahiri alive .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ bin Laden years , were suddenly not only thinkable but were being openly promoted in Beltway foreign policy think tank circles .\nThat such a dramatic turnaround could even be considered , let alone advocated , so soon after the years-long propaganda campaign portraying Al Qaeda as an existential threat to the West is only surprising to those who were ignorant of the real history of Al Qaeda and the real origins of the terror war .\nTo those who did know this history , the fact that those in the State Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodation of and even alliance with Al Qaeda came as no surprise .\nAnd it similarly came as no surprise that this alliance led\u2014exactly as it had in Afghanistan in the 1980s\u2014to the rise of a new terror group : the Islamic State .\nRising from the ashes of the same Al Qaeda in Iraq that had been led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi\u2014the US military 's self-proclaimed `` most successful information campaign to date '' \u2014the Islamic State rose to international prominence in 2014 when it captured Raqqa in Syria and began a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tikrit in northern Iraq before announcing the establishment of a caliphate .\nAs a convenient justification for reengaging the American military in Iraq and as another excuse for military intervention in Syria , it was only later that the truth began to emerge : not only had the US armed and trained these very ISIS fighters that they were now engaged in mortal struggle with and not only had the US ' own Defense Intelligence Agency precisely predicted the rise of an Islamic State in this area of Syria and Iraq two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces repeatedly stood down as ISIS convoys moved unimpeded , allowing them to take Ramadi in 2015 and allowing a convoy of stranded ISIS fighters to return home in 2017 .\nThe career of the group 's new leader , Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , followed the now-familiar terror bogeyman pattern .\nLike his predecessor Zarqawi , Baghdadi was pronounced dead , alive , arrested , dead and alive again so often that news of his actions quickly descended into farce .\nDetained by US forces at Camp Bucca in Iraq in 2004 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2007 and killed in May of that year before being arrested yet again in 2009 and killed yet again in 2010 , at which point even The Times was forced to concede , `` The arrest or death of Mr. Baghdadi , the insurgent fighter , has been reported so many times that it has become a macabre joke .

Bush 's address to Congress on September 20 , 2001 : Some even believe that the war ended with Barack Obama 's declaration of May 23 , 2013 : But , as convenient as these statements are for creating bookends for the story of the war on terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of that war .\nIn fact , the origins of the global war on terror go back much further than the general public has been led to believe .\nIn 1962 , the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , led by General Lyman Lemnitzer , issued a startling proposal to President John F. Kennedy on how to get the public on board with military invention in Cuba to remove Fidel Castro from power .\nCalled Operation Northwoods , the plan suggested a number of staged provocations , secretly committed by the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : blowing up a US ship in Guantanomo Bay and blaming the incident on the Cuban government ; staging terror attacks in the United States to be blamed on Cuban terrorists ; and even painting up a remote-controlled plane to resemble a passenger jet and destroying it over Cuba .\nThe incredible plan , rejected by Kennedy , who subsequently refused to renew Lemnitzer 's term as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , was classified and was not revealed to the public until 2001 , just months before 9/11 .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of using spectacular terror attacks as the justification for a widescale war continued to be employed by military planners .\nIn November 1998 , Philip Zelikow\u2014who would go on to chair the 9/11 Commission\u2014co-wrote an article in Foreign Affairs , the Council on Foreign Relations ' publication , with Ashton Carter , the future Secretary of Defense under President Obama , and John Deutsch , the former director of the CIA .\nTitled `` Catastrophic Terrorism : Tackling the New Danger , '' the article warns of a potential `` transforming event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the World Trade Center : The solution to this impending threat of catastrophic terrorism , Zelikow and his co-authors argue , is to take that threat seriously\u2014as the US government did in 1940 when it `` pondered what kind of forces it would need to wage a global war '' \u2014and to create new offices for coordinating homeland security and waging pre-emptive strikes against potential terrorists around the world .\nThen , unnoticed by much of the public , the global war on terror was first proposed on live TV on the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York time , as the blanket of dust from the freshly exploded towers was still settling on Manhattan and much of the world was still trying to process what was happening , a guest on BBC World News laid out the dawning of the new age of global terror with remarkable foresight .\nBut this prediction was not delivered by a US government official or an American intelligence agent or a Washington Beltway insider .\nIt was delivered by Ehud Barak , the former Prime Minister of Israel .\nIn the chaos of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the destruction of the Twin Towers , the global viewing public was presented all the key takeaways of 9/11 : that `` this is the time to deploy a globally concerted effort led by the United States '' ; that `` the world will not be the same from today on '' ; and , of course , that we `` do n't know who was responsible , '' although `` we will know in 12 hours . ''\nBut the name immediately implanted in the minds of the audience\u2014not for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long day of news coverage\u2014was that of Osama bin Laden .\nIn the following days , these takeaways became the talking points for the US government and its allies around the world .\nBefore the day was over , President Bush was already laying the rhetorical groundwork for the coming war , vowing that `` we stand together to win the war against terrorism . ''\nBy the end of the week , the American public was being prepared for a conflict much bigger than a conventional war : `` This crusade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a while . ''\nAnd , in the following week , Bush confirmed what the public had been told since the moment of the live televised strike on the World Trade Center : By the end of the month , the public had heard so many authoritative pronouncements about `` the evidence '' pointing to bin Laden 's responsibility for the 9/11 attacks that few noticed when the US government declined to release a promised white paper outlining that evidence\u2014a decision prompted by a `` lack of solid information '' about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by veteran journalist Seymour Hersh .\nInstead , the presentation of such evidence was outsourced\u2014as so much of the dirty work in the global war on terror would be\u2014to a third-party nation-state : the United Kingdom .\nOn September 30 , 2001 , UK Prime Minister Tony Blair appeared on the BBC 's Breakfast with Frost program to declare he had been shown `` absolutely powerful , incontrovertible evidence of [ bin Laden 's ] link to the events of the 11th of September , '' but because the evidence came from `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal it to the public .\nRather , the UK government would release a report laying out its case against Osama in great detail .\nThat dossier , titled `` Responsibility for the terrorist atrocities in the United States , '' was released on October 4th and was touted by the press as `` the clearest case yet of Osama bin Laden 's involvement in the September 11 attacks . ''\nThe document opens , however , by noting that it `` does not purport to provide a prosecutable case against Osama bin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' The first 60 points of the report provide general background information about bin Laden and previous terror attacks attributed to Al Qaeda , and the last ten points , dealing with `` Osama bin Laden and the 11 September attacks , '' are almost incomprehensibly vague .\nIt claims that `` at least three '' of the hijackers have been identified as `` associates of Al Qaeda , '' without listing how this conclusion was arrived at or even who these associates are .\nIt claims that the attack `` follows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is `` entirely consistent '' with the planning of previous attacks attributed to the group .\nAnd , most remarkably , it states that `` [ t ] here is evidence of a very specific nature relating to the guilt of bin Laden and his associates that is too sensitive to release . ''\nAt almost the exact same time , momentous events were taking place in Europe , where the North Atlantic Council , NATO 's main decision-making body , was receiving a classified briefing from a US State Department operative .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of that briefing was that for the first time in its history , NATO invoked Article 5 of its charter\u2014the self-defence clause that compels the organization to assist any member nation that is attacked by an outside force .\nBy `` proving '' that bin Laden had committed the attack in connection with the Taliban , the United States could launch the war on terror and compel NATO to assist in its invasion of Afghanistan .\nGiven the stakes involved , questions long swirled around this mysterious , classified briefing .\nWhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic Council that was so compelling ?\nWhat information persuaded the world 's largest and most powerful military alliance to launch an invasion of another nation ?\nThe public , it seemed , would never know .\nBut then , in 2009 , intelwire.com quietly posted a document online under the title `` Secret Post-9/11 Briefing to World Leaders . ''\nThe document is a US State Department cable addressed to the American embassies in the NATO countries and American allies around the world under the subject line `` September 11 : Working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorism and the case against Al Qaeda . ''\nThe cable is dated October 1 , 2001\u2014the day before Ambassador Taylor 's meeting with the North Atlantic Council\u2014and instructs its recipients to brief their host country 's government on `` the information linking the Al Qaeda terrorist network , Osama bin Laden , and the Taliban regime to the September 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon and the crash of United Airlines Flight 93 . ''\nThe document went largely unnoticed until 2018 , when Professor Niels Harrit wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor Report : The 9/11 Document that Launched US-NATO \u2019 s 'War on Terrorism ' in the Middle East , '' connecting the dots between this document and the briefing that Ambassador Taylor gave to the North Atlantic Council .\nMuch like the UK government dossier , the State Department cable contains no actual evidence of a link between bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks .\nIn fact , the cable is virtually identical to the UK report .\nAfter spending a full fifteen pages talking in generalities about terror , about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al Qaeda , and of previous attacks attributed to Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden , the document finally arrives at `` Part III '' purporting to demonstrate Al Qaeda 's involvement in the attacks .\nBut Part III begins by admitting that the investigation into the attacks is `` still in the early stage '' and that `` [ t ] here are still gaps in our knowledge . ''\nIt then goes on to detail circumstantial `` evidence , '' including the observation that `` bin Laden and his associates seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify as an important event or activity . ''\nFinally , the document talks about how the incident is `` tactically similar to earlier attacks '' because it involved planning and a desire to inflict mass casualties .\nAnd with that complete lack of evidence , the war on terror was launched and the invasion of Afghanistan began .\nAnd so , in October 2001 , the bombs began dropping on Afghanistan .\nThe war of terror had officially begun , and the public was told that one of the key objectives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osama bin Laden .\nBut as we have seen , one of the defining hallmarks of Al Qaeda throughout its reign of terror was its agents ' uncanny ability to cross borders illegally , evade capture repeatedly and generally slip through intelligence agency dragnets unimpeded .\nThis remarkable string of `` good luck '' included : \u2022 the `` Blind Sheik '' Omar Abdel Rahman , who entered the US with CIA support and lived there unmolested even after his green card was revoked ; \u2022 World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paperwork , working and living with a suspected terror ring that was under FBI surveillance , and fleeing the country before he was even a person of interest in the WTC investigation ; \u2022 Khalid Al-Mihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi , whose entry to the US from an Al Qaeda summit in Malaysia was known about and actively covered up by the CIA and who lived openly in the United States under their real names for over a year , repeatedly calling the Al Qaeda communications hub in Yemen that was being monitored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infamously , Al Qaeda `` triple agent '' Ali Mohammed , whose career as an Egyptian army officer , a `` failed '' CIA asset , a trusted aide to Al Qaeda second-in-command Ayman Al-Zawahiri , a US special forces training officer , a volunteer fighter in Afghanistan , an FBI deep-cover asset , Osama bin Laden 's personal bodyguard and the trainer of many of Al Qaeda 's terrorists throughout the 1990s is so improbable that it is generally ignored in most histories of Al Qaeda .\nAs incredible as all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale in comparison to the story that was about to unfold : the `` disappearance '' of Osama bin Laden , ostensibly the most wanted man on the planet , from under the noses of the American military and intelligence services .\nOsama bin Laden 's remarkable post-9/11 `` disappearance '' actually began on 9/11 itself , when his whereabouts were not a mystery to America or its allies in the region .\nIn fact , his location and activities on the night before 9/11 were well known to the US , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public until after his `` escape . ''\nDespite knowing bin Laden 's precise location and activities right up to the moment of 9/11 , however , and despite the fact that the Al Qaeda leader was already a wanted fugitive subject to international arrest warrants and under indictment by a US federal court , bin Laden continued to move around internationally with the full knowledge and complicity of state intelligence services .\nAnd , as remarkable as this may seem , bin Laden 's trip to Rawalpindi on the eve of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last time that the US would allow him to evade capture .\nIn the weeks after the attack , the Taliban offered to try bin Laden in Afghanistan or even hand him over to a third-party country if the US provided them with the same proof of Bin Laden 's guilt for 9/11 that Ambassador Taylor had supposedly provided NATO .\nBush turned the offer down .\nThen , after the invasion of Afghanistan began in October , the Taliban again tried to hand bin Laden over , this time dropping the request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again refused .\nThe war of terror , it turned out , was not about getting Osama .\nIn fact , if bin Laden had been captured or killed , it would have derailed the carefully laid plans for the Bush Administration 's aggressive new foreign policy .\nBut , having been sold on the simplified version of the war on terror\u2014the one that held the objective of that war was to kill or capture Osama bin Laden and to liquidate the Al Qaeda network\u2014the public believed that the fighting would be short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War .\nAfter all , how hard would it be for the army of the world 's unrivaled military superpower employing the tools of the most high-tech intelligence community in history to capture a lone fighter on dialysis in the caves of Tora Bora ?\nBush administration officials were quick to temper the public 's expectations on this point .\nThis was no ordinary elderly man living in an undefended cave , after all .\nThis was a comic book supervillain , an evil millionaire mastermind directing a terrorist army from his elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course .\nThere were no high-tech cave fortresses , no `` multi-tiered bedrooms and offices on the top , '' no `` secret exits on the side , '' no ventilation system or computer systems .\nIt was a fabrication , a literal artist 's rendering with as much reality as that of a comic book or a cartoon .\nBut , as an unfolding drama for the public following the war on their television sets half a world away , this story had enough twists and turns to keep any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war went as predicted .\nBy November , America 's relentless bombing had already routed the Taliban , driving them from Kabul toward Kunduz in the north .\nThere , the trapped fighters\u2014including not only Taliban but Al Qaeda members as well as Pakistani Army officers , intelligence advisers , and volunteers\u2014were saved from certain defeat by a miracle : the arrival of a squadron of Pakistani aircraft that flew in and airlifted them back to Pakistan .\nIt was later confirmed that the operation\u2014dubbed the `` airlift of evil '' \u2014was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had cut a secret deal with Pakistani President Musharraf to let the fighters escape and who `` ordered the United States Central Command to set up a special air corridor to help insure the safety of the Pakistani rescue flights . ''\nBut what about Osama bin Laden ?\nAs it turns out , his whereabouts were no great mystery to American forces , and , once again , he was allowed to escape .\nOn the eve of the invasion of Afghanistan in October , the Guardian reported that `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week and US and British intelligence agencies have a 'pretty good idea ' where he is now , '' suggesting that `` Western intelligence has a much clearer picture of bin Laden 's recent movements than has been admitted . ''\nThe report went on to note that bin Laden 's `` capture or death would reduce the pressure for wider military action against Afghanistan . ''\nBut this intelligence did not lead to bin Laden 's apprehension .\nAs American forces honed in on Kabul in early November , bin Laden and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape to Jalalabad in a very conspicuous late-night convoy .\nOne eyewitness reported : `` We do n't understand how they were n't all killed the night before , because they came in a convoy of at least 1,000 cars and trucks .\nIt was a very dark night , but it must have been easy for American pilots to see the headlights . ''\nOn November 13th , just one day before the Northern Alliance captured Jalalabad , bin Laden escaped once again , this time in a convoy of several hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in one of the vehicles , US forces opted to ignore the convoy and instead bombed the nearby Jalalabad airport .\nBin Laden and his men , now numbering a few hundred fighters , arrived in mid-November at the mountainous Khyber Pass on the border of Pakistan .\nOn November 15th , with the remaining Al Qaeda and Taliban holdouts pinned down in the caves of Tora Bora , the US military was in a position to eliminate the Al Qaeda threat , kill Osama bin Laden and end the war on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marines , special forces and CIA operatives who were positioned and ready to do this were blocked from doing so by their own superiors .\nThe story , exhaustively documented by CIA operatives , special forces operators , journalists and even a US Senate report , is clear and unambiguous .\nAs the US Senate report notes : `` By early December 2001 , bin Laden \u2019 s world had shrunk to a complex of caves and tunnels carved into a mountainous section of eastern Afghanistan known as Tora Bora . ''\nBoth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's elite special operations unit\u2014had tracked bin Laden from Jalalabad to Tora Bora .\nThey had `` real-time eavesdropping capabilities on Al Qaeda almost from their arrival , allowing them to track movements and gauge the effectiveness of the bombing '' and were able to pick up radio communications featuring bin Laden directly issuing commands to his troops .\nThey had him surrounded on three sides , and the relentless air strikes\u2014including the use of a 15,000 pound `` daisy cutter '' not used since Vietnam\u2014were decimating what was left of bin Laden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to secure the mountain pass leading out of Tora Bora and into Pakistan .\nGary Berntsen , the head of the CIA 's paramilitary operation against the Taliban and Al Qaeda , knew that the Afghan militias that the US had cobbled together were not up to the job of securing the pass .\nFrom mid-November to mid-December , he repeatedly begged his superiors for one battalion of US Army Rangers\u2014just 800 troops\u2014to help stop bin Laden from slipping away .\nAs the US Senate later noted , fulfilling Berntsen 's request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' : General James Mattis , the commander of the Marines at Kandahar , told a journalist that his troops could seal off Tora Bora , but his superiors rejected the plan .\nBerntsen fared no better in his quest to obtain 800 Army Rangers for the mission .\nNot only was his request rejected , but , remarkably , in the middle of the most important battle of the war , he was replaced as head of the CIA force in Afghanistan , effective immediately .\nHis replacement was to be Rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit chief who had helped conceal the information about Al-Mihdhar and Alhazmi 's entry to the US from the FBI .\nBlee was accompanied to Afghanistan by Michael Anne Casey , the bin Laden unit staffer who had actually stopped Doug Miller from sharing that info with the FBI .\nAt first , Berntsen was told that his request was denied because it might `` alienate our Afghan allies . ''\n`` I do n't give a damn about alienating our allies ! ''\nhe replied .\n`` I only care about eliminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head in a box ! ''\nLater , though , a different story emerged .\nAs it turns out , at the exact same time that bin Laden was holed up in Tora Bora , US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld ordered General Tommy Franks , who was leading the Afghan invasion , to redirect planning resources from Afghanistan to the Pentagon 's next target in the war of terror : Iraq .\nAs even the official story of the war on terror acknowledges , bin Laden and his top aides , seizing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bora and into Pakistan .\nAnd , just like that , the bogeyman of the war on terror was gone , allowed to escape yet again .\nHe would reappear from time to time to continue reminding the public about the origins of the terror war .\nBut now , the public 's attention was being turned to a new bogeyman .\nThat the Bush Administration would pivot so quickly from hunting Osama bin Laden to toppling Saddam Hussein was only surprising to those who did not know the neocons populating the Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to affect regime change in Iraq .\nIn 1996 , a group of prominent neoconservatives\u2014including Richard Perle , Douglas Feith and David Wurmser\u2014wrote a report for then-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .\nTitled `` A Clean Break : A New Strategy for Securing the Realm , '' the report urged Israel to `` shape its strategic environment '' by `` weakening , containing , and even rolling back Syria . ''\nThe way to do this , the report concluded , was to `` focus on removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq\u2014an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right\u2014as a means of foiling Syria \u2019 s regional ambitions . ''\nIn 1997 , twenty-five prominent neocons\u2014including ten who would go on to serve in the Bush Administration , and even Jeb Bush , the future president 's brother\u2014signed a `` Statement of Principles '' as the founding charter of a new think tank called the Project for the New American Century ( PNAC ) .\nThe statement called on then-President Clinton to reverse the defense spending cuts that marked the post-Cold War era and to `` increase defense spending significantly .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with an open letter to Clinton urging him to `` turn your Administration 's attention to implementing a strategy for removing Saddam 's regime from power . ''\nSurrounding himself with neocons on the campaign trail and eventually installing those neocons in all of the key security positions in his cabinet , President George W. Bush wasted no time in making these regime change dreams a reality .\nAs Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill later revealed , at his first major national security council meeting\u2014held just ten days into the new administration\u2014 '' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rumsfeld and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Hugh Shelton to begin preparing options for the use of US ground forces in the northern and southern no-fly zones in Iraq to support an insurgency to bring down the Saddam regime . ''\nThe second national security council meeting of the Bush administration , held two days later , also discussed regime change in Iraq , with one briefing document at the meeting marked `` secret '' and bearing the title `` Plan for post-Saddam Iraq . ''\nAnd , infamously , on the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already beginning plans for a retaliatory strike not just on bin Laden in Afghanistan but on Iraq .\nA note taken at 2:40 PM on September 11 , 2001 , records Rumsfeld saying he wanted `` best info fast .\nJudge whether good enough to hit Saddam Hussein at the same time .\nNot only bin Laden . ''\nHe also made sure to order staff to `` go massive '' and `` sweep it all up '' including `` things related and not . ''\nFrom before Bush even got into office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would attack Iraq .\n9/11 and the war on terror merely presented the neocons with the perfect opportunity to fulfill that agenda .\nThe only problem was how to tie Iraq into the war on terror in the minds of the public , a problem that Bush himself admitted to .\nThe job of connecting the public face of the war on terror\u2014bin Laden and Al Qaeda\u2014to Saddam and Iraq was made more difficult by the fact that there was no such connection .\nDifficult , but not impossible , for a committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve their political objectives .\nThe most direct link between Al Qaeda and Iraq was a trip that alleged 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta was reported to have made to the Iraqi consulate in Prague in April 2001 .\nAfter Atta 's pictures were published in the media in the wake of 9/11 , a Middle East informant told Czech intelligence that he had seen Atta meeting with a suspected Iraqi intelligence agent in the Czech Republic that spring .\nThe story became even more salacious when\u2014at the height of the anthrax scare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources '' planted a story in the German media that Atta had in fact received anthrax spores from his Iraqi contact in Prague .\nBut the entire story was such a preposterous lie that it was quickly disowned by both the FBI and the CIA .\nInvestigators found `` there was no evidence Atta left or returned to the US '' during that time frame and `` pointed to other evidence , including Atta 's cell phone records , to cast doubt on the idea that any meeting had occurred . ''\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence-free reports in German media , the anthrax used in the anthrax attacks on America in the fall of 2001 did not source from Iraq , but from the US military 's own bioweapons laboratory .\nNone of this stopped Vice President Dick Cheney from repeating the lie in his media appearances in the run-up to the Iraq War , however .\nThe story of Iraqi agents handing flasks of anthrax to 9/11 hijackers was a little too fanciful even for the credulous American public , however , and it was soon dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iraq war .\nInstead , a different set of lies would need to be found to sell the public on the illegal invasion of a sovereign nation .\nOn January 31 , 2003\u2014six months after senior British intelligence complained behind closed doors that the `` facts were being fixed around the policy '' of invading Iraq\u2014Bush met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair at the White House for a discussion on the matter .\nAs a now-infamous memo documenting the meeting records , Bush had already decided on military action , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 10th `` was now pencilled in . ''\nGiven that it was unlikely that the UN would pass a resolution authorizing the invasion absent some compelling incident , Bush suggested a way that Iraq could be provoked into aggressive action .\nAccording to the memo : `` The US was thinking of flying U2 reconnaissance aircraft with fighter cover over Iraq , painted in UN colours .\nIf Saddam fired on them , he would be in breach '' of existing UN resolutions , thus justifying military action .\nThe stunning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staging a false flag event as one option for provoking a war received some press attention at the time but has since largely been forgotten .\nAfter all , they did not need to get Iraq to shoot down a spy plane .\nThe neocons had hit on a different strategy for selling the war to the public .\nAs decades of after-the-fact journalism has exhaustively documented , every aspect of the `` Weapons of Mass Destruction '' story was a transparent and admitted lie .\nBut it was a remarkably successful lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a stunning 82 % of the American public believed that Saddam Hussein had `` provided assistance '' to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda , and 69 % believed that Saddam was personally involved in the September 11th attacks .\nAs the months wore on , however , it became harder to hide the fact that the mythical WMD stashes and mobile weapons labs and aluminum tubes that the public had been assured were keys to the `` imminent threat '' posed by Saddam 's regime simply were n't there .\nEven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to sell these lies to the public had to start pointing out the obvious : the Bush administration had lied in order to sell an illegal invasion of a sovereign country to the American public and to the people of the world .\nThe neocons realized that a renewed effort was going to be needed to connect Iraq to the war on terror in order to keep the public on board with the war as the invasion of Iraq morphed into the occupation of Iraq .\nAnd , as always , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of terrifying the public into rallying once again behind their government .\nThe fact that Iraq and Al Qaeda were mortal enemies might have been an insurmountable obstacle to anyone concerned with the truth .\nBut these were neocons .\nTheir logic was simple : if the Al Qaeda bogeyman did n't exist in Iraq , they would have to create it .\nSo that 's exactly what they did .\nFounded in Jordan in 1999 , even the official history of the terrorist organization that became known as `` Al Qaeda in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had nothing to do with either Al Qaeda or Iraq .\nInstead , its founder , Ahmed al-Khalaylah , was a Jordanian militant whose terror cell Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad , or `` Congregation of Monotheism and Jihad , '' was dedicated to the overthrow of the Jordanian monarchy .\nLike many of the figures in the Al Qaeda story , the biography of al-Khalaylah is not that of a devout Muslim , let alone a dedicated jihadi .\nA high school dropout , al-Khalaylah was known for drunken brawls and drug dealing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Afghanistan to join the Mujahideen in 1989 , just as the Soviets were leaving .\nFrom there , the story of this soon-to-be-feared terrorist leader tells us he returned to Jordan `` a few years later , '' founded a terror cell known as Jund al-Sham that attracted the attention of the authorities , and was sent to prison in 1992 where he `` adopted more radical Islamic beliefs . ''\nAfter his release from the Jordanian prison in 1999 , he immediately became involved in a new plot to bomb the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourist sites in Jordan just before New Year 's Day 2000 .\nThe plot was foiled , and al-Khalaylah fled through Pakistan to Afghanistan , where , we are told , he met with bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders , with whose assistance he set up a terrorist training camp for Jordanian militants in Herat .\nJoining the resistance to the US invasion after 9/11 and adopting the nom de guerre Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , he fled to Iran in January 2002 .\nHis whereabouts and activities during 2002 are `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western and Arab intelligence agencies '' assured The Washington Post that , despite being a known terror operative and wanted by numerous governments , Zarqawi , like many other Al Qaeda figures , `` moved frequently and with relative ease among Iran , Syria , Lebanon and Iraq , expanding his network . ''\nThen , in 2003 , still a relative unknown even within the world of militant jihad , Zarqawi turned up in Baghdad , where he was catapulted to international infamy not by his actions , nor by the promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but by the US government .\nThe remarks , delivered during Colin Powell 's infamous speech justifying the forthcoming invasion of Iraq to the UN Security Council in February of 2003 , were\u2014like most of the specific accusations in the address\u2014demonstrably false .\nZarqawi was a relative nobody in Iraq at the time ; the CIA later admitted there was no evidence that Hussein had been `` harboring '' him ; and his group was not , in fact , affiliated with Al Qaeda when Powell made his speech .\nNevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spotlight of attention was showered on Zarqawi by the US State Department .\nAttacks attributed to or claimed by Zarqawi were relatively few , but received inordinate amounts of attention from the international press .\nThese attacks were often designed to inflame Shia/Sunni hatred , thus turning resistance to the occupation into a full-on sectarian conflict that tore the country to its roots .\nAnd in 2004 , Zarqawi\u2014who , we are told , calculated that attaching the Al Qaeda brand name to his group would give it more cach\u00e9 in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laden and received the Al Qaeda title `` Emir of Al Qaeda in the Country of Two Rivers . ''\nThe specter of Al Qaeda in Iraq\u2014just another cynical and calculated lie when used by Powell to justify the Iraq invasion\u2014had become a reality .\nWhat resulted from this US government-promoted character was a career so remarkable that it could only be believed in a Hollywood action movie .\n.\n.\nor a history of Al Qaeda .\nIn 2004 , after being allegedly caught and freed by Iraqi security forces in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize who he was , '' Zarqawi was then reportedly killed in an American bombing raid in northern Iraq in March before pledging his allegiance to Osama and officially joining Al Qaeda in October .\nIn 2005 , Zarqawi was , according to various sources : arrested in Baakuba in January ; left `` seriously injured , possibly dead '' after a US-led offensive in May ; evacuated to a neighbouring country `` with the help of doctors from the Arab Peninsula and the Sudan '' ; killed in fighting in Ramadi in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed again in a terrorist bombing in Mosul in November .\nThis remarkable career finally came to an end when , we were told , Zarqawi had been killed yet again ( and presumably for good ) in June of 2006 .\nBut not everyone believed that this final account of Zarqawi 's death was the true one .\nRather than simply mistakes in reporting , other members of the Iraqi resistance insisted that Zarqawi had in fact been killed early on in the US invasion and that his name was simply being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued American occupation of the country .\nSheikh Jawad Al-Khalessi , a noted Shiite imam in Baghdad , was quoted in Le Monde as saying : Al-Khalessi was not the only one with his doubts about Zarqawi 's true nature .\nThe Project on Defense Alternatives of the Commonwealth Institute in Massachusetts released a report in 2004 excoriating the US government for its propaganda attempting to portray Zarqawi as a terrorist leader in Iraq : Similarly , The Financial Times , The Telegraph , Knight Ridder Newspapers , The Los Angeles Times and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various aspects of the Zarqawi myth into question .\nA report in The Telegraph in 2006 called him `` a figurehead around whom dissident groups in Iraq were rallying , rather than an elusive fighter directing military operations , '' noting that `` the more the Americans blamed al-Zarqawi for terrorist atrocities , the greater his credibility on the Arab street , '' and quoting an `` unnamed Sunni insurgent leader '' as calling Zarqawi `` an American , Israeli and Iranian agent who is trying to keep our country unstable so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' According to The Atlantic , even Osama bin Laden himself `` suspected that the group of Jordanian prisoners with whom al-Zarqawi had been granted amnesty [ in 1998 ] had been infiltrated by Jordanian intelligence . ''\nAnd then , right before he was reported dead for the last time , skeptics of the Zarqawi narrative were proven right in a remarkable fashion .\nOn April 9 , 2004 , The Washington Post published proof in the form of internal military documents that the US government had played up the myth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a psychological operations campaign : In case there was any doubt that the propaganda campaign was targeted at Americans , the program included the Pentagon `` selectively leaking '' a letter to a US reporter purported to be written by Zarqawi and boasting of his role in the wave of suicide attacks terrorizing Iraq .\nThe letter was dutifully covered by The New York Times even though there were serious questions about whether it was real at all .\nThe Washington Post expos\u00e9 quotes an internal briefing document produced by US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military chief spokesman Brig .\nGen. Mark Kimmitt boasted that `` [ t ] he Zarqawi PSYOP program is the most successful information campaign to date . ''\nAnd then , two months after these explosive revelations , Zarqawi was reported dead for the last time , a character written out of the script once his value as a propaganda construct was exhausted .\nWith Zarqawi out of the picture , something else would would be required to keep the American public , and the people of the world , invested in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the battle would have to return .\nThankfully for the US government , Osama bin Laden was only too happy to oblige .\nFrom the time of his miraculous `` escape '' from Tora Bora on , the outside world only knew Osama bin Laden from his occasional video releases .\nThe most infamous of these productions was a video released to the public by the US Defense Department on December 13 , 2001 .\nSupposedly `` obtained in Afghanistan during the search of a private home in Jalalabad '' after anti-Taliban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tape , we are told , `` bore a label indicating it was made on November 9 '' and `` shows bin Laden sitting on the floor in a bare room in a house in Kandahar '' with `` several other men , including two aides and an unidentified cleric , or Sheikh . ''\nMost importantly , it contains\u2014according to the Pentagon-provided subtitles that were added to the video before its distribution to the press\u2014bin Laden 's confession to planning the 9/11 attacks .\n`` We had notification since the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day , '' the US government translation has bin Laden saying .\n`` We calculated in advance the number of casualties from the enemy who would be killed based on the position of the tower . ''\nThe press release provided by the Pentagon noted that , due to the poor quality of the tape , they were not able to produce a verbatim transcript , but that their translation `` does convey the messages and information flow '' of the conversation , an answer that was apparently good enough for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer was not sufficient for the foreign press .\nThe following week , German TV channel Das Erste broadcast an edition of their investigate program , `` Monitor , '' in which they hired their own independent translators to check the Pentagon 's transcript of the tape .\nThe report calls the Pentagon translation `` very problematic , '' noting that `` at the most important places where it is held to prove the guilt of bin Laden , it is not identical with the Arabic . ''\nTranslator Dr. Murad Alami , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence `` We calculated in advance the number of casualties from the enemy , '' the words `` in advance '' had simply been inserted by the US government translators .\nThose words did not appear on the tape .\nSimilarly , the word `` previous '' in `` We had notification since the previous Thursday , '' was never said , and the subsequent statement that an event would take place on that day can not be heard in the original Arabic version .\nThe Monitor report concludes that the Pentagon translation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape\u2014deliberately adding words in key passages to make it sound like a confession\u2014was not only inaccurate but actually manipulative .\nAs Gernot Rotter , a professor of Islamic and Arabic Studies at the Asia-Africa Institute at the University of Hamburg , states in the report : `` The American translators who listened to the tapes and transcribed them apparently wrote a lot of things in that they wanted to hear but that can not be heard on the tape no matter how many times you listen to it . ''\nThe startling revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a confession tape at all\u2014aired on Germany 's premiere public broadcaster and widely discussed in the German press\u2014was never reported in the US .\nThat video was followed in short order by a 30-minute video of a visibly gaunt and graying Osama bin Laden delivering what appears to be a last message to the Arab world .\nReleased on December 27 , 2001 , and presumably recorded during the fight at Tora Bora , bin Laden comments on his own mortality : `` God willing , America 's end is near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my continued existence .\nWhether Osama is killed or not , the awakening has begun . ''\nIn the 30-minute video , bin Laden does not move his left arm at all and appears visibly weak .\nInterested at that moment in turning the public 's attention away from Osama bin Laden and toward the next front in the War on Terror , Iraq , the Bush administration dismissed the video as `` sick propaganda possibly designed to mask the fact the Al Qaeda leader was already dead . ''\n`` He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it be released in the event of his death , '' The Telegraph quoted one White House aide as saying .\n`` The guy is trying to show he 's untouched by the US bombing but he looks under pressure to me . ''\nRecorded months after his reported journey to Rawalpindi for kidney dialysis , this video would not be the first or the last time that Osama bin Laden would be reported as dead or dying .\nLike Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , bin Laden was also reported dead on several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u2022 on December 26 , 2001 , when it was reported that Osama bin Laden had died from a serious lung complication in Tora Bora ; \u2022 on January 18 , 2002 , when Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf told CNN : `` I think now , frankly , he is dead for the reason he is a .\n.\n.\nkidney patient '' ; \u2022 in September 2006 , when French intelligence leaked a report suggesting bin Laden had died of typhoid fever in Pakistan ; \u2022 and in March 2009 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Codevilla stated : \u201c All the evidence suggests Elvis Presley is more alive today than Osama bin Laden.\n\u201d But , also like Zarqawi , none of these reported deaths stopped the Osama bin Laden character from reappearing on the TV screens of a traumatized public to remind them of the importance of the ongoing war on terror .\nWhat followed in the ensuing years was a series of video and audio releases of questionable provenance , often reported in carefully worded turns of phrase that gave the press plausible deniability as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Osama bin Laden .\nA message aired on Al Jazeera in February 2003 , for instance , was reported by the BBC as `` a poor quality audio recording in which a man 's voice , identified as bin Laden 's , is heard calling for suicide attacks against Americans and resistance to any attack on Iraq . ''\nThe recordings were often mundane .\nAn April 2006 audio message of a speaker `` believed to be Osama bin Laden '' called on Muslims to `` prepare for a long war '' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message warned of the dangers of climate change .\n`` Talk about climate change is not an ideological luxury but a reality , '' the speaker , purportedly bin Laden , told his fellow jihadis .\nOther recordings appeared at opportune times for the planners of the war on terror , catapulting the terror threat back into the public consciousness just when questions about that narrative were beginning to emerge .\nThe 2004 US presidential election contest between George Bush and John Kerry , for instance , featured an unusual `` October surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ videotape in which the terror mastermind appears to claim responsibility for 9/11 and to warn the American public of future strikes .\nAnd then again , in September 2007 , just days before General David Petraeus was set to deliver his report to Congress on the controversial `` surge '' in Iraq and just days before the sixth anniversary of 9/11 , there was Osama bin Laden to remind the public of the ever-present terror threat .\nCapitalizing on the conveniently timed video release , President Bush was quick to cite it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war in Iraq and that the increasingly unpopular war\u2014now generally understood to have been an illegal invasion waged on false pretenses\u2014was in fact an essential part of the war on terror .\nBut buried beneath the attention-grabbing headlines and substance-less soundbites with which the media covered this release , troubling questions began to arise about the nature of the video .\nThe aging , weary , gaunt , graying and partially paralyzed Osama bin Laden of 2001 was gone , replaced by a visibly younger and healthier man , despite having numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better part of a decade on the run as the world 's most wanted man .\nSporting jet black hair and what many media commentators pointed out looked like a fake beard , the figure on the screen seems to be moving in an unrealistic way .\nBizarrely , the video freezes at the 1-minute-and-58-second mark while the audio continues .\nThe image remains frozen for most of the video message , only resuming briefly around the 12-minute mark .\nWhat 's more , all of the references to current events\u2014those parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as `` proving that Osama is still alive '' \u2014take place during the times when the video is frozen .\nIn fact , the video proved so unusual that media commentators had to go out of their way to assure their viewers that it was indeed real .\nPerhaps the strangest part of the video , however , was the manner in which it was released to the public .\nThe video , it turns out , was not released by Al Qaeda , but by the US government .\nThe month after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the video had originally been `` intercepted '' by SITE Intelligence Group , described as `` one of several small , commercial intelligence firms that specialize in intercepting al-Qaeda 's internet communications , often by clandestine means . ''\nAccording to The Washington Post : It was not explained how SITE had `` obtained an early copy '' of an Osama bin Laden video , but it was far from the only time that mysteriously well-connected internet researchers had unexplained exclusive access to Al Qaeda video productions .\nResearchers and companies who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovering '' and publishing Al Qaeda messages ( sometimes even ahead of Al Qaeda itself ) included : \u2022 SITE , or the `` Search for International Terrorist Entities , '' whose promotional materials touted the company 's `` one-of-a-kind access '' to `` messages , videos , and advance warnings of suicide bombings '' from `` the most hard-to-reach corners of violent online extremist communities , '' whose clientele included leading media outlets and even government agencies , and whose founder , Rita Katz , was born in Iraq to a wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spying for Israel in 1969 in a military tribunal and executed in a public hanging ( which , we are told , Katz did not think had much bearing on her work ) and who , despite not having any intelligence connections herself , found a job allowing her to search for terrorists online shortly after moving to New York in the 1990s ; \u2022 `` Laura Mansfield , '' a pseudonymous South Carolina housewife who\u2014despite being a self-described `` mom sitting here in her dining room typing away on my computer '' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to `` monitor '' jihadi message boards and chat rooms , and who\u2014with no special training or connections to the world of terror or espionage\u2014was consistently able to find and publicize Al Qaeda videos before anyone else , including : a `` 2007 '' video of Osama bin Laden that , it was quickly discovered , was actually a five-year-old video that had already been previously released but reported as `` new '' by the credulous mainstream press ; and multiple releases featuring `` Azzam the American , '' a.k.a .\nAdam Pearlman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a board member of the Anti-Defamation League and who , we are told , converted to Islam with a single internet post and was quickly recruited by Al Qaeda to serve as `` translator , video producer , and cultural interpreter '' for their media committee ; \u2022 and IntelCenter , a company described as `` a private contractor working for intelligence agencies '' and headed by Ben Venzke\u2014the former Director of Intelligence Special Projects at iDefense , where he worked alongside people like Jim Melnick , a psychological operations specialist who served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Defense Intelligence Agency\u2014that similarly supplied the US government and media with Al Qaeda videos released by As-Sahab , the terror group 's media production arm , and somehow exclusively obtained by this private contractor in Virginia .\nThe public had good reason to question the reality of these suspiciously timed and mysteriously sourced audio and video recordings .\nIn 1999 , William Arkin wrote a piece for The Washington Post called `` When Seeing and Hearing Is n't Believing '' in which he reported on the digital morphing technologies that were then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and elsewhere .\nHe reported on one demonstration of this technology\u2014a fake recording of Gen. Carl W. Steiner , former Commander-in-Chief , US Special Operations Command , announcing `` Gentlemen !\nWe have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the United States government . ''\nThe fake audio was so impressive that General Steiner asked for a copy .\nAnother demonstration involved Colin Powell announcing that he was being well treated by his captors .\nThe technology continued to feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror dragged on .\nIn 2003 , the CIA Iraq Operations Group came up with a `` wacky idea '' for discrediting Saddam Hussein in the eyes of his people : to create a video purporting to show the Iraqi dictator having sex with a teenage boy .\nAmazingly , Stein also confirmed that the CIA did make a fake video of Osama bin Laden : But as successful as these information operations and Al Qaeda media releases were in keeping the terror threat in the minds of the public , the neocons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to need much more than that to meet their objectives .\nThe war on terror , launched in Afghanistan and waged in Iraq , was never meant to end there .\nBut getting the public\u2014already weary of the years-long struggle in Afghanistan and increasingly disillusioned with the debacle in Iraq\u2014on board with the invasion of yet another country was going to be difficult unless another spectacular terror event came along to justify opening up yet another front in the war on terror .\nAnd , if the terror bogeyman was not willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were once again ready and willing to create it .\nSeymour Hersh was not the only one warning about the possibility of the Bush White House staging a terror event in the waning days of its administration to trigger a bold new escalation with Iran .\nEven Zbigniew Brzezinski\u2014whose involvement in Operation Cyclone started the American involvement in Afghanistan that led to the creation of Al Qaeda in the first place\u2014warned the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2007 that a military provocation or terrorist act whose origin `` would be very difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Tehran in order to justify US military action on Iran .\nBut the neocons\u2014suffering from plummeting approval ratings , mounting domestic difficulties and the ramifications of a global financial crisis\u2014no longer had the political capital to stage terror events and garner public approval for their agenda .\nBy 2008 , after seven long years in the grip of the existential threat that they were told was the basis for a generation-defining , civilizational struggle with no end in sight , the American public was getting tired .\nThey did n't want the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey were hoping for change .\nLuckily for them , that 's precisely what the 2008 US presidential election seemed to offer .\nThe public was ready for change .\nIn fact , the idea of a shift from the bellicose , belligerent , aggressive foreign policy and the war on terror rhetoric of the neocons to the promised hope and change of the Obama administration was so enticing that not only did Obama win the 2008 election , he also won over the world at large .\nSo excited were people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobel Peace Prize committee decided to bestow their 2009 prize on Obama before he had taken a single substantive action in office .\nThose not swept up in the hope and change delirium were quick to point out that the committee had made a mistake in handing a peace prize to a president still actively involved in military engagements .\nWhat not even his most cynical critics seemed prepared for , however , was the idea that Obama would not only continue the Bush administration 's war on terror but that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war in Afghanistan and Iraq under Bush , Obama would ultimately lead the war of terror into seven countries .\nOne of Obama 's first moves in office was to oversee a dramatic escalation in Afghanistan , a `` troop surge '' that was meant to resolve the security issues in the country but actually exacerbated them , finally leading to the dramatic downfall of the US-backed regime and the reinstallation of the Taliban in 2021 .\nAnd , as we shall see , despite promising a swift resolution to the war in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of authority to the Iraqi government delayed as long as legally possible but the US was ultimately drawn in again as the terror group that they fostered led to a battle against the Islamic State .\nBut the newly revitalized war on terror\u2014now given new cover by a smiling , peace-prizing-winning , softer-spoken Commander-in-Chief\u2014did not end there .\nObama oversaw the expansion of Bush 's drone war into Pakistan : He led the `` kinetic military action '' in Libya against previous war on terror ally Moammar Gaddafi : He began the decade-long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria : He waged war in Yemen along with the Saudi government , who had supported and fostered terror groups in the region for years : And he extended the `` Authorization for Use of Military Force '' \u2014the legislation passed in the wake of 9/11 authorizing the president to `` use all necessary and appropriate force '' against those nations , organizations or persons he determines `` planned , authorized , committed or aided '' that attack\u2014to include Al-Shabaab in Somalia .\nBut although these escalations appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Terror that was sold to the public in the wake of 9/11 , they were not .\nIn fact , it quickly became apparent that a remarkable transition had begun to occur .\nAl Qaeda , the ultimate face of evil and the undisputed enemy in the grand terror war narrative , were now the `` good guys '' \u2014or at least serviceable allies\u2014in the fight against the next target in the war of terror .\nThis unbelievable turnaround had in fact begun during the Bush administration , when the neocons had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBeing predominately Shiite , Iran is in fact the enemy of the radical Wahabbis and Salafist Muslims that populate the ranks of Al Qaeda and other Sunni terror groups .\nIn targeting Iran , the US\u2014like the British Empire before them\u2014found it convenient to switch allegiances , arming , funding and promoting the very radicals they had just been at war with in order to defeat their enemy of the moment .\nAs Hersh detailed in his articles on `` The Redirection '' and `` Preparing the Battlefield , '' and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` shift in Middle East strategy '' by the Bush administration included : \u2022 supporting Fatah al-Islam\u2014a militant Islamic fighting force led by a `` former associate of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi '' dedicated to `` spreading the ideology of Al Qaeda '' \u2014in their struggle against Iranian ally ( and Israeli enemy ) Hezbollah ; \u2022 providing covert funds to the Mujahedin-e-Khalq , a strange cult-of-personality that , as a violent group of radicals that participated in bombings inside Iran and even aided Mossad in assassinating Iranian scientists , was not merely lauded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gala events by neocons and their fellow-travellers ; \u2022 secretly backing `` opposition groups '' in Syria , one of Iran 's most important regional allies ; \u2022 and `` supplying money and weapons '' to Jundullah , a group with `` close ties to Al Qaeda '' ( including reportedly being at one time headed by alleged `` 9/11 mastermind '' Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ) that `` conducted raids into Iran from bases in Pakistan '' with covert CIA assistance .\nThat these operations would have started under Bush and the neocons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew anything about the real nature of the so-called war on terror .\nThat they would be continued and even expanded under Obama , the Ambassador of Hope and Change , was more surprising to those who did not yet grasp the true scale and scope of this war .\nNo , the substance of the Bush redirection did not change under Obama , only the tone and flavour of that policy changed .\nObama did not win multiple advertising awards for his 2008 Hope and Change election campaign for nothing .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he knew that to get the public on board with such a radical shift in objectives , he was going to need an equally radical event to take place to tie a bow on the Osama bin Laden narrative and redirect the public 's attention .\nAnd , on May 2 , 2011 , that event occurred .\nCodenamed Operation Neptune Spear , the mission to kill bin Laden involved a daring team of Navy SEALs flying two stealth-modified Black Hawk helicopters from the Jalalabad military base in Afghanistan through Pakistani air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the world 's most wanted man had evidently been living for years , evading the most comprehensive dragnet in history .\nCrash landing one of the choppers in the compound courtyard , a massive firefight broke out .\nThe SEALs , clearing weapons stashes and barricades while fending off bin Laden 's henchmen , made their way to the third-floor bedroom where the dastardly villain used one of his wives as a human shield .\nShooting her in the leg to get her out of the way , the SEALs then managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one hitting bin Laden in the head and the other in the chest\u2014just as the terror kingpin was reaching for the gun he kept at the ready by his headboard .\nMaking good their escape , the Navy SEAL heroes blew up their damaged helicopter while a standby chopper that had been prepared for the mission in case of an emergency flew in and whisked the remaining task force members out with bin Laden 's body in tow .\nReturning to Bagram Air Base , bin Laden 's body was immediately flown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it was buried at sea in accordance with Islamic tradition .\nAnd just like that , it was done .\nPublic Enemy number one , the face of the war on terror , was dead ; slain by the valiant Navy SEALs in a daring operation that was broadcast in real time to the White House Situation Room , where the Commander-in-Chief of the War of Terror , Barack Obama , and his iron-willed cabinet of terror warriors watched with steely determination .\nIndeed , this was not the stuff of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some minor police action or military operation .\nIt may not have been the grand showdown in the cave fortress that the public had been prepared for , but\u2014befitting the comic book supervillain of the war on terror narrative\u2014this was the stuff of Hollywood blockbusters .\nYes , this was the stuff of Hollywood blockbusters .\nBut , like a Hollywood blockbuster , the story of the raid was itself fiction .\nIn fact , in the face of mild questioning by the generally deferential press , every single aspect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told to the public in those euphoric hours after Obama 's momentous announcement was proven to be a lie .\nThere had been no firefight .\nHe did not use his wife as a human shield .\nBurial at sea was not part of Islamic tradition .\nIn fact , it was directly opposed to that tradition .\nEven the famous picture from the Situation Room was a lie ; there had been no live video feed of the raid .\nBut it was n't just the details of the raid itself that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of the decade-long manhunt for Osama , dramatized in Oscar-winning movies like Zero Dark Thirty and recounted in countless reports , books and tell-alls , proved to be similarly fraudulent .\nIn fact , the story began to fall apart from the very moment it was told to the public .\nBut while most of the press remained content to pick at the corners of the story , leaving the substance of the narrative intact , others dug deeper , looking for answers amid the confusing confluence of lies , obfuscations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn a lengthy article for The London Review of Books in 2015 that\u2014sourcing to unnamed , retired officials with no direct knowledge of the events recounted\u2014was about as solidly sourced as the official account , Seymour Hersh alleged that , while bin Laden had indeed been killed in Abbottabad , he had in fact been living at the compound as a prisoner of the ISI for years and that every part of the official narrative of the raid\u2014from the story of the `` Al Qaeda courier '' by which the CIA allegedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive to collect bin Laden 's DNA to the burial at sea\u2014was in fact an element of an elaborate ( and seemingly unnecessary ) cover story to obscure that fact .\nIn a piece for The Independent the year after the raid , Patrick Cockburn pointed out the inherent contradiction between early reports that the raid had uncovered a `` treasure trove '' of intelligence that `` portrayed bin Laden as a spider at the centre of a conspiratorial web '' and later admissions that he had had almost no contact with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his organization and its capabilities .\nOthers simply pointed out that , given this was at least the ninth occassion in which journalists , politicians , intelligence officials or others had pronounced Osama bin Laden dead , it was not to be believed without evidence .\nBut that evidence was not forthcoming .\nInstead , the government went to extraordinary lengths to cover it up .\nAll the files from the raid\u2014including `` copies of the death certificate and autopsy report for bin Laden as well as the results of tests to identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pentagon 's computers and transferred to the CIA , where they could be more carefully guarded from Freedom of Information Act requests .\nPictures and video of the raid , including pictures of Osama bin Laden 's dead body that\u2014the public were told\u2014may be released , were instead sealed away forever .\nAt the time , all that was released were a few short videos of a man purported to be Osama bin Laden that\u2014it was claimed\u2014had been taken from the compound ( although it was never explained why bin Laden would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camera , watching himself on TV ) and some salacious details about the records allegedly seized from the compound 's computers\u2014like the devout Muslim jihadi 's predilection for porn\u2014that seemed reminiscent of the CIA 's previous `` wacky ideas '' for faking videos about Hussein and bin Laden .\nBut CIA director Leon Panetta did leak classified details of the raid at a 2011 award ceremony attended by Mark Boal , the screenwriter who would go on to write and produce Zero Dark Thirty , the Hollywood dramatization of the manhunt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the raid on the silver screen and even falsely implied that the CIA 's illegal torture program had been essential in helping to track down the terror kingpin .\nThe full truth of what happened in Abbottabad , now obscured by lies , misinformation , selective `` leaks , '' self-serving tell-alls and still-classified data will likely never see the light of day .\nBut to the directors of the War of Terror , that is beside the point .\nOsama bin Laden had served his purpose as the villain in the terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that purpose , he was being written out of the script .\nIn the end , that was all Osama bin Laden had ever been : a character in the terror war drama .\nOne so good that , if he did n't exist , they would have had to invent him .\nThe death of Osama bin Laden may have ended one chapter in the War on Terror , but it was not the end of the story .\nIn a key sense , that story would simply repeat , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ template that the terror war planners could draw upon as needed in their efforts to prolong their never-ending conflict indefinitely .\nThe alignment with radical Islamists to achieve short-term geostrategic goals\u2014a strategy refined by the British Empire over centuries of practice in the `` Great Game '' of global geopolitics and reaching its apotheosis with the US operation to arm the Afghan Mujahideen in the 1980s\u2014was simply employed once again as the US led its NATO allies in a `` humanitarian war '' against Moammar Gaddafi in Libya .\nFormer enemies in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iraq insurgency who had been killing American troops in Iraq , and even designated terrorists who had been rendered and tortured by the CIA , were now the good guys , helping to overthrow Gaddafi 's government in Tripoli .\nThat same story played out yet again in Syria , where the US and its regional allies once again made a deal with the devil , this time in the name of toppling the government of Bashar al-Assad .\nArming the most radical elements of these terror groups with US-procured weapons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base in Jordan , it was not long before the Bush-era `` redirection '' of the terror war was complete and Al Qaeda was now widely recognized as a convenient ally of the US in Syria .\nIn 2012 , Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) Senior Fellow Ed Husain wrote of `` Al-Qaeda 's Specter in Syria , '' noting that `` The Syrian rebels would be immeasurably weaker today without Al Qaeda in their ranks . ''\nIn 2014 , a trio of foreign policy `` experts '' published a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good and Bad of Ahrar al-Sham : An Al Qaeda\u2013Linked Group Worth Befriending . ''\nAnd in 2015 , Barak Mendelsohn\u2014writing in the pages of the same Foreign Affairs magazine in which Philip Zelikow and his co-authors had `` predicted '' the terror war\u2014penned `` Accepting Al Qaeda : The Enemy of the United States ' Enemy , '' in which he argued : In conclusion , Mendelson writes flatly : `` It is certainly ironic that at this point , when the United States is the closest it has ever been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be better served by keeping the terrorist organization afloat and Zawahiri alive .

''\nBut beginning with the invasion of Afghanistan and continuing throughout the so-called `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern emerged : the targets of the terror war always `` coincidentally '' happened to have geopolitical , geostrategic and geoeconomic value for the US and its allies beyond its status as a supposed terrorist haven .\nAfghanistan affords a prime transportation corridor for rich Caspian Sea oil and gas reserves , a fact that led the Taliban to Texas in the 1990s for talks with Unocal .\nAs the heart of the so-called `` Golden Crescent , '' Afghanistan supplied as much as 90 % of the world 's opium until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year prior to the invasion .\nThe country also harbors one of the richest treasure troves of untapped minerals and rare earth elements in the world , with copper , iron ore , lanthanum , neodymium , aluminum , gold , silver , zinc , mercury and lithium deposits estimated to have a value of over $ 1 trillion .\nAnd , in 1997 , Zbigniew Brzezinski\u2014who , as we have already seen , helped draw the Soviets into Afghanistan by launching Operation Cyclone in 1979 , thereby playing his own part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American military intervention in Eurasia was going to be needed to assure America \u2019 s `` global primacy '' in the 21st century .\nHe also warned that getting the American public on board with such a military undertaking was going to be extremely difficult `` except in the circumstance of a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat . ''\nPerhaps it is no surprise , then , to learn that the first major military directive of the Bush Administration\u2014National Security Presidential Directive 9 , calling for `` military options against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , command-control , air and air defense , ground forces , and logistics '' \u2014was requested in March of 2001 , drafted by June , and presented to the president on September 4 , 2001 , seven days before 9/11 .\nDONALD RUMSFELD : By the first week of September , the process had arrived at a strategy that was presented to principals and later became NSPD-9 , the President 's first major substantive national security decision directive .\nIt was presented for a decision by principals on September 4th , 2001 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later signed by the President , with minor changes and a preamble to reflect the events of September 11th , in October .\nOn September 17 , 2001 , President Bush signed a still-classified directive granting the CIA the power to secretly imprison and interrogate detainees at so-called `` black sites . ''\nBy November , the CIA general counsel was already attempting to expand the definition of `` interrogation '' to include torture .\nAs the Jerusalem Post later reported : On November 26 , 2001 , soon after the September 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general counsel wrote that \u201c the Israeli example \u201d could serve as \u201c a possible basis for arguing .\n.\n.\nregarding terrorist detainees that \u2018 torture was necessary to prevent imminent , significant , physical harm to persons , where there is no other available means to prevent the harm.\n\u2019 \u201d But torture had not been foresworn by the United States and most other nations out of moral concerns for the rights of terrorists .\nIt has long been understood that torture is useless for obtaining reliable intelligence from detainees .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ is getting those detainees to `` confess '' whatever their interrogators want them to confess .\nThe CIA , under pressure from the Pentagon and the White House to produce intelligence linking Al Qaeda and Iraq , suddenly had a way to produce that intelligence and they would not have to wait long for their opportunity to use it .\nAt around the same time that bin Laden was retreating to Tora Bora , a Libyan national named Ibn al-Libi was captured by the Pakistani army and handed over to US forces at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was turned over to the CIA for interrogation under the agency 's new `` enhanced interrogation '' rules .\nUnder the supervision of newly appointed station chief Rich Blee , Michael Anne Casey managed the handling of al-Libi , and it was not long before he was saying exactly what his interrogators wanted him to say : bin Laden had sent two high-level Al Qaeda terrorists to Iraq for biological and chemical weapons training .\nOf course , the story was not true .\nAl-Libi could n't answer even the most basic questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name any of the Iraqi officials involved , identify what biological or chemical materials were being used for the training or even identify where the training occurred .\nThe Defense Intelligence Agency immediately dismissed the story as a fabrication , noting that `` it is more likely this individual is intentionally misleading the debriefers . ''\nRemarkably , even the CIA itself issued a highly classified report on `` Iraqi Support for Terrorism '' warning that the claim of Iraqis training Al Qaeda agents came from `` sources of varying reliability . ''\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen apart .\nAl-Libi had recanted his claim and the CIA had withdrawn all intelligence reports based on his information .\nBut by that point , they had already served the administration 's purpose , becoming another part of the growing Al Qaeda/Iraq myth .\nCONDOLEEZZA RICE : Several of the detainees , in particular , some high-ranking detainees , have said that Iraq provided some training to Al Qaeda in chemical weapons development .\nSo yes , there are contacts between Iraq and Al Qaeda .\nBUSH : We 've learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb-making and poisons and deadly gases .\nBut fabrications about clandestine meetings and secret training could only go so far toward motivating the public for war .\nIn order to really sell the public on Iraq 's centrality to the war on terror , it would be helpful for the neocons to be able to point to an act of terror undeniably perpetrated by the Iraqis .\nAnd , since Saddam Hussein was not willing to oblige , an incident would have to be created .\nGEN.

Rockefeller hired Ivy Ledbetter Lee to transform him from the head of the Standard Oil hydra into the kind old man handing out dimes to strangers .\nMore to the point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adoration of the public , he had to appear to give them what they want : money .\nHe devoted hundreds of millions of dollars of his vast oil monopoly fortune to establishing institutions that , he claimed , were for the public good .\nThe General Education Board .\nThe Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research .\nThe Rockefeller Foundation .\nSimilarly , Bill Gates has spent much of the past two decades transforming himself from software magnate into a benefactor of humanity through his own Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's legacy with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation long having eclipsed The Rockefeller Foundation as the largest private foundation in the world , with $ 46.8 billion of assets on its books that it wields in its stated program areas of global health and development , global growth , and global policy advocacy .\nAnd , like Rockefeller , Gates ' transformation has been helped along by a well-funded public relations campaign .\nGone are the theatrical tricks of the PR pioneers\u2014the ubiquitous ice cream cones of Gates ' mentor Warren Buffett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Rockefeller-handing-out-dimes gimmick .\nNo , Gates has guided his public image into that of a modern-day saint through an even simpler tactic : buying good publicity .\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation spends tens of millions of dollars per year on media partnerships , sponsoring coverage of its program areas across the board .\nGates funds The Guardian 's Global Development website .\nGates funds NPR 's global health coverage .\nGates funds the Our World in Data website that is tracking the latest statistics and research on the coronavirus pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health and development issues , both through its BBC Media Action organization and the BBC itself .\nGates funds world health coverage on ABC News .\nWhen the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer was given a $ 3.5 million Gates foundation grant to set up a special unit to report on global health issues , NewsHour communications chief Rob Flynn was asked about the potential conflict of interest that such a unit would have in reporting on issues that the Gates Foundation is itself involved in .\n`` In some regards I guess you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heck of a lot of things you could touch in global health these days that would not have some kind of Gates tentacle , '' Flynn responded .\nIndeed , it would be almost impossible to find any area of global health that has been left untouched by the tentacles of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .\nIt was Gates who sponsored the meeting that led to the creation of Gavi , the Vaccine Alliance , a global public-private partnership bringing together state sponsors and big pharmaceutical companies , whose specific goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for vaccines and other immunisation products . ''\nAs a founding partner of the alliance , the Gates Foundation provided $ 750 million in seed funding and has gone on to make over $ 4.1 billion in commitments to the group .\nGates provided the seed money that created the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria , a public-private partnership that acts as a finance vehicle for governmental AIDS , TB , and malaria programs .\nWhen a public-private partnership of governments , world health bodies and 13 leading pharmaceutical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accelerate progress toward eliminating or controlling 10 neglected tropical diseases , '' there was the Gates Foundation with $ 363 million of support .\nWhen the Global Financing Facility for Women , Children and Adolescents was launched in 2015 to leverage billions of dollars in public and private financing for global health and development programs , there was the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as a founding partner with a $ 275 million contribution .\nWhen the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations was launched at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2017 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was the Gates Foundation with an initial injection of $ 100 million .\nThe examples go on and on .\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation 's fingerprints can be seen on every major global health initiative of the past two decades .\nAnd beyond the flashy , billion-dollar global partnerships , the Foundation is behind hundreds of smaller country and region-specific grants\u2014 $ 10 million to combat a locust infestation in East Africa , or $ 300 million to support agricultural research in Africa and Asia\u2014that add up to billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as no surprise , then , that\u2014far beyond the $ 250 million that the Gates Foundation has pledged to the `` fight '' against coronavirus\u2014every aspect of the current coronavirus pandemic involves organizations , groups and individuals with direct ties to Gates funding .\nFrom the start , the World Health Organization has directed the global response to the current pandemic .\nFrom its initial monitoring of the outbreak in Wuhan and its declaration in January that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission to its live media briefings and its technical guidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the WHO has been the body setting the guidelines and recommendations shaping the global response to this outbreak .\nBut even the World Health Organization itself is largely reliant on funds from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .\nThe WHO 's most recent donor report shows that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is the organization 's second-largest donor behind the United States government .\nThe Gates Foundation single-handedly contributes more to the world health body than Australia , Canada , France , Germany , Russia and the UK combined .\nWhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is , in fact , like Bill Gates himself , not a medical doctor at all , but the controversial ex-Minister of Health of Ethiopia , who was accused of covering up three cholera outbreaks in the country during his tenure .\nBefore joining the WHO , he served as chair of the Gates-founded Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria , and sat on the board of the Gates-founded Gavi , the Vaccine Alliance , and the Gates-funded Stop TB Partnership .\nThe current round of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries was enacted on the back of alarming models predicting millions of deaths in the United States and hundreds of thousands in the UK .\nThe work of two research groups was crucial in shaping the decision of the UK and US governments to implement wide-ranging lockdowns , and , in turn , governments around the world .\nThe first group , the Imperial College COVID-19 Research Team , issued a report on March 16th that predicted up to 500,000 deaths in the UK and 2.2 million deaths in the US unless strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The second group , the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Bill Gates ' home state of Washington , helped provide data that corroborated the White House 's initial estimates of the virus ' effects , estimates that have been repeatedly downgraded as the situation has progressed .\nUnsurprisingly , the Gates Foundation has injected substantial sums of money into both groups .\nThis year alone , the Gates Foundation has already given $ 79 million to Imperial College , and in 2017 the Foundation announced a $ 279 million investment into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health data and creating models .\nAnthony Fauci , meanwhile , has become the face of the US government 's coronavirus response , echoing Bill Gates ' assertion that the country will not `` get back to normal '' until `` a good vaccine '' can be found to insure the public 's safety .\nBeyond just their frequent collaborations and cooperation in the past , Fauci has direct ties to Gates ' projects and funding .\nIn 2010 , he was appointed to the Leadership Council of the Gates-founded `` Decade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vaccine Action Plan\u2014a project to which Gates committed $ 10 billion of funding .\nAnd in October of last year , just as the current pandemic was beginning , the Gates Foundation announced a $ 100 million contribution to the National Institute of Health to help , among other programs , Fauci 's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ' research into HIV .\nAlso in October of last year , the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation partnered with the World Economic Forum and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauging the economic and societal impact of a globally-spreading coronavirus pandemic .\nGiven the incredible reach that the tentacles of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have into every corner of the global health markets , it should not be surprising that the foundation has been intimately involved with every stage of the current pandemic crisis , either .\nIn effect , Gates has merely used the wealth from his domination of the software market to leverage himself into a similar position in the world of global health .\nThe whole process has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philanthropy , but the foundation is not structured as a charitable endeavour .\nInstead , it maintains a dual structure : the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation distributes money to grantees , but a separate entity , the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust , manages the endowment assets .\nThese two entities often have overlapping interests , and , as has been noted many times in the past , grants given by the foundation often directly benefit the value of the trust 's assets : This is no mere theoretical conflict of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hero for donating $ 35.8 billion worth of his Microsoft stock to the foundation , but during the course of his `` Decade of Vaccines , '' Gates ' net worth has actually doubled , from $ 54 billion to $ 103.1 billion .\nThe Rockefeller story provides an instructive template for this vision of tycoon-turned-philanthropist .\nWhen Rockefeller faced a public backlash , he helped spearhead the creation of a system of private foundations that connected in with his business interests .\nLeveraging his unprecedented oil monopoly fortune into unprecedented control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockefeller was able to kill two birds with one stone : molding society in his family 's own interests , even as he became a beloved figure in the public imagination .\nSimilarly , Bill Gates has leveraged his software empire into a global health , development and education empire , steering the course of investment and research and ensuring healthy markets for vaccines and other immunization products .\nAnd , like Rockefeller , Gates has been transformed from the feared and reviled head of a formidable hydra into a kindly old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public .\nBut not everyone has been taken in by this PR trick .\nEven The Lancet observed this worrying transformation from software monopolist to health monopolist back in 2009 , when the extent of this Gates-led monopoly was becoming apparent to all : This brings us back to the question : Who is Bill Gates ?\nWhat are his driving interests ?\nWhat motivates his decisions ?\nThese are not academic questions .\nGates ' decisions have controlled the flows of billions of dollars , formed international partnerships pursuing wide-ranging agendas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' for Big Pharma vaccine manufacturers .\nAnd now , as we are seeing , his decisions are shaping the entire global response to the coronavirus pandemic .\nNext week , we will further explore Gates ' vaccination initiatives , the business interests behind them , and the larger agenda that is beginning to take shape as we enter the `` new normal '' of the COVID-19 crisis .", "author": "James Corbett", "url": "https://www.corbettreport.com/flashback-how-bill-gates-monopolized-global-health-2020/", "published": "Sat, 24 Sep 2022 11:33:07 +0000",
