Triumph of the National Security State My next article will deal in depth with the illegal Contra resupply operation and the Iran arms deal .\nThis article is meant to serve as a brief introduction to the case followed by a much broader analysis of the whole Iran Contra era .\nI thought it was best to get some tangents out of my system in this extended introduction .\nIn following the threads that make up the tapestry of the Iran-Contra scandal one is quickly covered with a web of connections that cover the world .\nThe globalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not begin in this era reached new heights .\nFaced with the threat of congressional oversight the national security state outsourced covert operations to allied and even enemy countries .\nIt also increasingly privatized covert war turning to networks of ex spies and military men , arms dealers , mercenaries , NGO \u2019 s lobbyists , religious groups , and drug cartels .\nThe Iran Contra era stretches from late 1975-1992 covering the final third of the Cold War which begins in the aftermath of the liberation and reunification of Vietnam a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first postwar chapter of the Cold war had stretched from 1945 ( secretly 1943 ) to 1959 with the Cuban Revolution marking the beginning of the second part of the Cold War .\nThe Cold War had actually begun in 1917 with the Russian revolution and the failed invasion to crush the soviet union , followed by the attempt to isolate the USSR while arming Nazi Germany for an attack on the USSR .\nWorld War 2 was only a minor interruption in this cold war .\nThe postwar cold war began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted to install the Greek fascist collaborators and death squads into power and to destroy the communist Partisans that had already liberated Greece .\nThe OSS and MI6 were already planning to recruit the Nazis and their allies to battle the Soviets .\nThe postwar cold war had seen dissent crushed to make way for an anti-soviet hysteria , the fixing of the Italian elections to prevent a communist victory the victory of the Chinese Revolution , the Korean war , the CIA creation of South Vietnam , coups in Iran and Guatemala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third of the Cold War covered the Cuban Revolution , the failed bay of Pigs Invasion , the export of US counter-insurgency advisers around the world to teach torture , and assassination to prevent \u201c another Cuba \u201d and the transformation of the Vietnam war from a covert counter-insurgency campaign to a genocidal military occupation .\nHowever the empire managed a major diplomatic success opening relations with the People \u2019 s Republic of China .\nIn the Iran-Contra era China would help the US arm and sometimes train counter-revolutionary forces around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Contras , and the Afghan Mujahideen .\nIt also worked with the US backing the Khemer rouge in Cambodia and waging war on Vietnam .\nDomestically during this second phase of the cold war the civil rights movement and the Anti-war movement had briefly awakened some awareness of the ugly realities of the empire .\nWatergate , the Coup in Chile , exposed an imperial presidency and the CIA \u2019 s role in replacing democratic socialism with fascism .\nThe third chapter began with the post-independence war in Angola when Cuba intervened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa .\nCongress passed the Clark amendment barring further US involvement but the CIA merely turned to it \u2019 s allies in the Safari club to continue the war which would last until 1992 .\nThe Safari club would also play a key role in giving birth to Al Qaeda .\nThe CIA was already meddling in Afghanistan by the late 70 \u2019 s in part through the Shah of Iran .\nThe Cuban victory in Angola would ultimately lead to the fall of Apartheid South Africa in the early 90 \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American soft power ( The NED ) had infiltrated and destroyed the Soviet Union thanks to the treachery and incompetence of Mikhail Gorbachev .\nGorbachev was himself overthrown the Soviet Union disbanded .\nThe Warsaw pact was absorbed into NATO .\nRussia was ruled by a drunken US puppet Boris Yeltsin hundreds of millions were plunged into poverty and chaos as the country was looted .\nBetween 1975-1992 the US waged covert and overt dirty wars around the globe in Afghanistan , Libya , Angola , Mozambique , Namibia , Uganda , Congo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lebanon , Syria , Grenada , Cambodia , East Timor , Guatemala , El Salvador , Argentina , Nicaragua , Panama , Uruguay , Ecuador , Chile and more .\nThe US was supplying both sides in the Iran/Iraq war it was backing Israel \u2019 s plans to dominate and balkanize the middle east .\nIt was backing South Africa \u2019 s efforts to dominate Southern Africa .\nThese were the true crimes of the Iran/Contra era the crimes of the American empire .\nIt would take a team of historians to catalog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era which covered four presidencies Ford , Carter , Reagan , and Bush and to begin to assess the death count .\nThe Clinton years that strange period between the end of the Cold War and the beginning of the War on Terror saw the US create chaos around the globe in order to justify the continued existence of the National Security State the destruction of Yugoslavia , and the wars in Rwanda and the Congo which lead to millions of dead were examples of sophisticated psychological warfare .\nThe US covertly instigated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while pretending merely to be a concerned bystanders and eventually \u201c saviors \u201d when they overtly intervened .\nThe Clinton years with the destruction of Yugoslavia and it \u2019 s massive NATO expansion set the stage for the second cold war .\nThe conventional narrative of Iran-Contra Scandal was consciously created to narrow the focus in time and geography so as to expose as little as possible about the American empire .\nIt also narrowed the focus on the domestic implications of the scandal .\nCongress only investigated activities between 1984-1986 to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power in a soft coup in 1980 .\nBack in late 1975 CIA director William Colby had been fired and replaced with George H. W. Bush .\nBush \u2019 s ties to the agency went back to the 1950 \u2019 s when he was recruited into the CIA a fact he successfully kept secret for decades .\nWhile Ambassador to China Bush and the CIA chief of station James Lilley had recruited Deng Xiaoping who would later rule China and rollback socialism .\nBush \u2019 s reign as CIA director in 1976 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge when Cuban forces managed to halt the South African advance in Angola .\nHe turned to the Safari Club to help the US wage war in Angola He was in charge when the Argentine Junta seized power and began their bloody dirty war .\nBush was CIA director when the CIA cubans formed CORU and launched an international terrorist campaign which included blowing up a Cuban airliner .\nThe culprit Louis Posada Carrilles would later be mysteriously \u201c escape \u201d ( via CIA bribes ) a Venezuelan prison and ended up as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1976 was also the Year of the Orlando Letlier bombing when Chile \u2019 s former Ambassador was killed in a car bomb set by CIA cubans working for DINA ( chilean Intelligence . )\nBush had ignored the warnings he received that DINA assassins were trying to obtain fake passports for the assassination and then after it took place he tried to blame left wing exiles for the Letelier assassination to protect fascist Chile .\nWhen President Carter won the 1976 election promising to reform the National Security State Bush begged him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused and Bush vowed revenge .\nOver 40 ex and current CIA employees made up the CIA agents for Bush contingent during the Republican primary and the 1980 election .\nReagan \u2019 s campaign manager was an old OSS hand Bill Casey who had also invented the tax shelter .\nHe created his own team of spies that had moles inside the Carter Administration like Donald Gregg at the NSC a Bush loyalist .\nThey set out to destabilize Carter .\nTheir friends in the oil industry launched a full scale economic war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil shortage .\nCarter \u2019 s brother was lured into a Libyan arms deal and then exposed .\nFinally the Reagan campaign resorted to outright treason negotiating a deal with Iran for a huge amount of weapons in exchange for not freeing the hostages until after the election .\nThis part of the scandal is so shocking ( to most Americans ) that media and academia have largely ignored all the evidence that has emerged over the years in support of it .\nIt is known as the October Surprise .\nThere is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the US the UK and France and their allies with Savak and the Shah \u2019 s government intentionally helped install Khoemeini as preferable to a nationalist or socialist style government in Iran .\nThe October surprise arms deal undermined the secular minded Iranian President Bani Sadr while elevating Khoemeni \u2019 s faction .\nThe whole world has been reshaped in Reagan \u2019 s image neo-liberalism has triumphed at home and abroad .\nReagan can never be allowed to be exposed as a traitor .\nThe fact that it is accepted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genocide around the world show the minor importance most westerners place on the lives of billions of third world people .\nTo get excited or angry about such things is bad form .\nNo US president had ever been prosecuted for war crimes .\nThe Iran Contra era can thus be seen from multiple angles .\nAmerica \u2019 s War on the World .\nThe National Security State vs the illusion of democracy .\nThe triumph of capitalism , the slashing of the social safety net .\nThe taming of the media .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIA .\nThe rise of Bush from CIA director to President .\nThe mobilization of the Christian right and far right voters .\nThe rise of the imperial presidency .\nThe triumph of the executive branch over any form of checks and balances.The birth of the NED .\nIran Contra is part of an interlocking pattern of scandals , coups , wars and deep events that go back to the early years of the cold war and before .\nParticularly relevant are the coups in Guatemala and Iran , the Bay of Pigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RFK assassinations , Vietnam , the secret war in Laos , Watergate , The Chilean coup of 73 , The Letelier bombing , GLADIO , Nugan Hand , Koreagate , the Ed Wilson affair , the EATSCO scandal , Iraqgate , WACL , BCCI , Inslaw .\nA rotating cast of characters making multiple appearances .\nPeople like E. Howard Hunt , Frank Sturgis , Ted Shackley , Thomas Clines , Richard Secord , and George H.W .\nBush .\nThe same names keep popping up .\nThe never ending scandal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c really work \u201d money laundering , fraud , corruption as standard operating procedure in the alliance between politicians , organized crime , intelligence , and big business that form the basis for the study of \u201c Deep Politics \u201d As I write it is the 35th anniversary of the unraveling of the Iran-Contra scandal .\nThe Reagan administration was caught waging an illegal war on Nicaragua funded in part with profits from the sale of anti-tank and and anti-air missiles to Iran in exchange for freeing American hostages .\nBack in 1984 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbidding any aid or advice to the Contras after the CIA was caught mining Nicarguan Harbors and supplying the Contras with what the press dubbed an \u201c Assassination Manual \u201d a Phoenix program style guide to Psychological warfare .\nCongress was less offended by the Contras numerous war crimes then being consistently lied to about what the CIA were up to in Nicaragua .\nCasey had gotten them to agree originally to a 500 man force whose purpose was solely to prevent Nicaragua from arming the Salvadoran Guerrillas attempting to overthrow the mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had grown to 12,000 men .\nCongress passed the 1st Boland amendment forbidding the Contras from being used to overthrow the Nicaraguan government Reagan and Casey \u2019 s actual goal .\nNow by authorizing the Harbor mining without properly informing them Casey had made congress look like fools .\nThe fact that the Contras operated like a death squad mutilating some village doctor for providing health care or a teacher for providing education were less important to congress .\nThe story of the National Security Council and Oliver North \u2019 s role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had begun to leak in the press in 1985 thanks to journalists Robert Parry , Brian Barger and Alfonso Chardy .\nHowever when Congress had chosen to accept administration denials Parry \u2019 s editors at AP tried to kill the story .\nIt was Lee Hamilton head of the House Intelligence Committee and who later chaired the Iran/Contra hearings who decided to trust North and ignore the investigative journalists .\nThe media was secretly aware that Oliver North was negotiating the hostages release because some of the hostages were journalists but covered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNorth was in fact in regular contact with Parry \u2019 s editors at AP on efforts to release AP journalist Terry Anderson .\nNorth was also a favorite source for journalists .\nNorth \u2019 s role at NSC was basically an open secret .\nThere was also a civil suit filed by the Christic Institute in the wake of the La Penca bombing which hoped to expose a vast criminal conspiracy by ex-CIA and ex-Military who were acting as private contractors in the illegal Contra resupply operation and an even more illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1986 a plane carrying arms to the Nicaraguan Contras was shot down by a 14 year old Sandinista with a soviet surface to air missile .\nThe cargo kicker a former Air America ( the notorious drug smuggling CIA airline ) employee Eugene Hasenfus was wearing a parachute and managed to jump out of the plane and parachute to the ground .\nHe was captured and began to talk saying he was working for the CIA and naming \u201c Max Gomez \u201d and others working on the illegal contra resupply operation .\nMax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felix Rodriguez a drug dealing Cuban CIA man who \u2019 s history went back to the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba and who had helped capture and kill Che Guevara in Bolivia reportedly keeping Guevara \u2019 s severed hands in a jar .\nHe had served in the Phoenix program in Vietnam under Vice President George H.W .\nBush \u2019 s National Security adviser Donald Gregg .\nPresident Ronald Reagan had personally ordered his National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane to find ways to circumvent the Boland Amendment and keep the Contras together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had put Oliver North in charge of the illegal Contra resupply operation The scandal went all the way to the top .\nLikewise by following the threads of the careers of men like Felix Rodriguez it was possible to unravel a great deal of secret history .\nCongress had ironically agreed the summer of 1986 restore 100 million in lethal aid to the Contras and the Reagan Administration was desperate to cover up their blatant violation of the Boland amendment in case congress decided to change it \u2019 s mind .\nThere was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became available so the illegal contra resupply operation had continued .\nElliot Abrams who had been supervising the whole illegal contra resupply as the State Department representative on the Restricted Interagency Group along with the NSC \u2019 S Oliver North and the CIA \u2019 S Alan Fiers .\nElliot Abrams was sent out to the press and Congress to deny everything .\nAbrams was an expert in lies and denial his prior role had been Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights when he pretended that El Salvador and Guatemala were showing progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a campaign of mass murder and genocide .\nHis lies got honest reporters like Raymond Bonner reassigned for exposing massacres diring the Central American dirty wars .\nOnce again many in the media fell for Elliot Abrams categorical denials of any connection between the Reagan administration and the contra resupply operation that Hasenfus exposed .\nGenerally the US media parrot the line put out by the US state department which is why a supposedly independent press are in practice government propagandists .\nJournalists may be interested in exposing the truth but their editors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national security state .\nThey all go to the same dinners and cocktail parties .\nLuckily before before contra resupply story story could be killed news of the Iran arms for hostages deals were published in the Lebanese newspaper Al Shiraa and once the western press picked up on it the story exploded .\nReagan had publicly called Iran murder incorporated , it \u2019 s allies Hezbollah in Lebanon had bombed the US embassy killing a dozen CIA middle east operatives , kidnapped the CIA station chief William Buckley , then bombed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iran had been officially labeled a terror sponsor by the US which was waging an international campaign Operation Staunch to force it \u2019 s allies to stop selling arms to Iran .\nUnlike the illegal war on Nicaragua which was in line with Reagan \u2019 s public rhetoric , the Iran arms deals had the potential to alienate Reagan \u2019 s right wing base and if the facts had been known and if there had been the political will , President Reagan could have been impeached or even sent to prison for violation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first the Reagan administration tried it \u2019 s usual strategy of denial but it soon became clear that scapegoats and limited hangouts would be required .\nThe current Attorney General Ed Meese a key adviser to Reagan for decades took charge of the coverup .\nHe conducted a brief investigation and his aides discovered a memo from Oliver North on plans to divert funds from the Iran Arms Sales to the Contras .\nMeese checked with North , CIA director Bill Casey , and National Security Adviser Admiral John Poindexter who all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretending he didn \u2019 t know about the diversion .\nIt became known as the \u201c Diversion Memo \u201d and Meese used it as a giant diversion from Reagan \u2019 s illegal authorization of Arms sales from Israel to Iran in the fall of 1985 .\nInstead the issue became did the President know about the diversion ?\n\u201c What did he know ?\nand When did he Know it ?\n\u201d was the media refrain echoing Watergate coverage .\nNorth was all to happy to play the political fall guy taking full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would later reveal that Reagan knew everything he was doing .\nBy then however the press were again told to kill the story by their editors .\nRobert Parry at Newsweek was told in 1989 the North trial wasn \u2019 t newsworthy .\nGeorge H.W .\nBush was now president thanks to the inability of the press , the legislative and Judicial Branches to get to the bottom of the Iran Contra scandal in which Bush was deeply implicated .\nReturning to late 1986 President Reagan appointed the Tower Commission to confirm Meese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myth of a rogue National Security Council which Reagan had failed to properly supervise .\nThen the House and Senate held a circus like joint investigation of the Iran Contra scandal held on nationwide television the democrats aimed to embarrass rather then destroy Reagan but their strategy backfired when the telegenic Oliver North was embraced as a hero .\nThe republicans however decided that the only crime had been congress \u2019 s passage of the Boland amendment and their attempt to meddle in the President \u2019 s control of foreign policy .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick Cheney who was then a House Rep. for Wyoming serving on the Iran Contra committee .\nIn 2004 at the height of the war on terror he would cite the minority report on the Iran-Contra scandal and it \u2019 s argument for absolute executive power as a blueprint for the Bush Administrations policies .\nThe price of this failed spectacle which catapulted North to stardom was congress grant of limited immunity to North and Poindexter for anything they might say .\nThis would later sabotage the criminal investigation of the Iran Contra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissed and they were forced to pay 1 million dollars in damages .\nThe Kerry Committee investigated the Contra drug connection but the media ignored or mocked him .\nAn Independent Council was appointed in December of 1986 they would conduct a 6 year investigation they would gradually unravel the true story of Iran Contra but they faced non-stop obstruction from the intelligence community , Department of Justice , and the court of appeals which overturned the convictions of North and Poindexter .\nFinally President George Bush whose Iran/Contra role was becoming ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iran Contra figures after loosing the 1992 election to Bill Clinton who as Governor of Arkansas was tied to CIA man Barry Seals contra resupply and drug smuggling operations .\nNeedless to say President Clinton did not want anyone digging into Iran Contra either .\nThe story was revived briefly by the heroic journalist Gary Webb his career was destroyed , and he committed suicide .\nIronically however thanks to his work the Contra drug connection a part of the scandal many in the media and Congress wanted to suppress is now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHaving laid out the basics of the scandal I \u2019 ll provide some historical background .\nEarly in the 19th the US had proclaimed the Monroe doctrine which while framed as opposing European imperialism in the Americas was in reality the US laying claim to the entire hemisphere .\nAs it \u2019 s power grew it began to enforce these claims with bribery , invasions and coups .\nIn the 19th century Nicaragua was embroiled in a civil war between the liberals and conservatives .\nWilliam Walker had attempted to conquer northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party hired American mercenary William Walker and his \u201c Fillibusters \u201d to intervene but he decided to seize power and institute slavery he ruled Nicaragua for a year as a dictator but was forced out when Nicaragua \u2019 s neighbors invaded to expel him .\nHe died when he tried to invade and seize power again .\nShortly before World War 1 the US had invaded and occupied Nicaragua for nearly 20 years .\nRevolutionary General Augusto Sandino would fight a Guerrilla war to attempt to expel them .\nNicaragua would become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a counter-insurgency campaign .\nSandino was able to survive the bombs and the endless manhunt by US marines outsmarting US forces .\nHowever once he signed a peace deal he was assassinated .\nThe US had trained the Nicaraguan National Guard to carry out the dirty war against the Nicaraguan people .\nThey appointed their lackey Anastasio Somoza as it \u2019 s head and he would soon seize power his family ruling Nicaragua for decades until the 1979 Nicaraguan Revolution .\nSomoza would be a key backer of the coup to overthrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe coup in Guatemala would form a blueprint for the later failed Bay of Pigs invasion and later the attempt to overthrow the Sandinistas in Nicaragua .\nHowever the Dirty war on Nicaragua would be far more brutal and last far longer then the earlier campaigns .\nAfter the Cuban Revolution the US had spent 2 decades training Latin American countries to wage dirty wars on their people .\nIn each country Intelligence , agencies , the Military , and the police waged a coordinated campaign of kidnapping torture and assassination .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ would unite the regimes in one vast dirty war on the continent .\nThis would occur in the wake of the CIA backed Chilean coup of Pinochet against Allende in 1973 .\nThe roots went back to the beginnings of the cold war and the chain of fascist coups had started much earlier in Brazil in 1964 .\nBrazil , Chile , Argentina , Ecuador , Uruguay , Bolivia , and Paraguay were the first 7 members of a network of countries that carried out a coordinated campaign of assassination , torture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s this was increasingly combined with installing neoliberal shock therapy economic reforms in Chile and Argentina .\nTiny Central America was home to even worse horrors as hundreds of thousands were killed in dirty wars in Guatemala , El Salvador and Nicaragua under Somoza .\nGuatemala \u2019 s campaign of terror had begun when a wave of military uprisings swept the country in protest over the training of Cuban exiles for the upcoming bay of pigs invasion in camps in Guatemala .\nBy the late 60 \u2019 s it had evolved in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with CIA and special forced advisers to wage a scorched earth campaign to destroy the Guerrillas .\nIn El Salvador after a huge massacre was conducted by the fascist dictator General Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez of Indians and suspected communists that killed 32,000 the government had faced little opposition .\nThe US still sent in it \u2019 s advisers in the 1960 \u2019 s and by the 1970 \u2019 s their endless murder of political opponents and labor had forced the opposition to take up arms .\nIn Nicaragua a revolution had begun in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had waged a brutal scorched earth campaign in an attempt to hold onto power .\nBut on July 26 1979 he was forced to flee the country and for the first time since Cuba in 1959 a revolution had succeeded in overthrowing a brutal US backed dictator .\nThe Carter administration had cut off aid to Somoza because of his outrageous war crimes and refusal to negotiate with the opposition .\nSomoza turned to Israel for arms .\nIsrael was also playing key roles in the dirty wars in El Salvador and Guatemala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out genocide against the Maya Indians .\n500 of Somoza \u2019 s national guard who had carried out numerous war crimes relocated briefly to Guatemala taking shelter with the \u201c Godfather of the Death Squads \u201d Mario Sandoval Alarcon .\nThey were determined to follow the example of the Cuban exiles and wage covert war on revolutionary Nicaragua .\nSoon they were joined by Argentine advisers fresh from their dirty war and having recently carried out the Bolivian cocaine coup arrived to advise these contras or Counter Revolutionaries .\nThe Carter administration hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicaragua \u2019 s new government .\nThe CIA was doubtless already backing the Contras who named themselves The September 15th Legion and began carrying out kidnappings , terrorism , and drug smuggling .\nReagan would be elected in part through illegal campaign donations from Central American oligarchs in Guatemala and El Salvador who had been promised their full support in waging their dirty wars by former DIA dir General Daniel Graham and General John Singlaub a military/CIA man and future World Anti-Communist League head .\nReagan would keep his promise vastly escalating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die in Guatemala and El Salvador in the name of preventing \u201c another Nicaragua.\n\u201d Torture rape and mass murder were standard operating procedures .\nLike in Nicaragua the administration would lie to congress to carry out the dirty wars in Guatemala and El Salvador and constantly find ways to circumvent any limits they put on US support .\nThis never became a scandal .\nIn Nicaragua 35,000 would perish in attacks by the contra death squads .\nCasey put Duane \u201c Dewey \u201d Clarridge in charge of Latin America and he ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliver North in the wake of Boland II .\nClarridge was transferred to head the European Division where he would help arm the Contras and facilitate the Iran arms deals .\nTo summarize the cold war history of the middle east would be impossible in so short a space and would require months or years of extra research .\nThe US \u2019 s backing of Israel alienated the entire region .\nThe US scheme to create a middle eastern version of NATO and it \u2019 s constant coups to install pro-western regimes would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIA overthrew Prime minister Mossadegh and installed the shah .\nHe had been branded a communist for nationalizing the British owned Anglo-Iranian oil company .\nHe had expelled all the british spies and diplomats after their failed coup plots and attempt to lay siege to the country to prevent it \u2019 s selling oil .\nThe British were forced to turn to the CIA and after the coup they turned over half of Iran \u2019 s oil over to US corporations .\nThe CIA and Mossad trained the Shah \u2019 s secret police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents .\nIran became a top customer of the American military industrial complex .\nRichard Secord would serve as an air force adviser in the 1960 \u2019 s and then after serving in Vietnam and Laos return in the late 1970 \u2019 s as head of the US military assistance program .\nHe would meet various corrupt Iranian businessmen with intelligence ties that would later appear in the October surprise and Iran Contra scandals .\nThen he would supervise arms sales at the Pentagon .\nIn Egypt the CIA recruited Nasser \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1973 Arab Israeli war , expel the soviet advisers from Egypt and then President Carter convinced him to completely betray the Arab cause by signing a peace deal with Israel .\nHis reward was a massive increase in weapons sales from the US .\nSecord at the Pentagon was a silent partner along with Ted Shackley in Ed Wilson and Thomas Clines EATSCO a transport company created to profit off the Egyptian arms sales .\nHowever Sadat \u2019 s peace deal was an obstacle to plans Israeli plans to invade Lebanon .\nHis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to EATSCO and the Muslim Brotherhood assassinated him .\nMubarak who was also a key figure in the egypyian side of skimming money from the arms sales was installed as Egypt \u2019 s new leader .\nEd Wilson in the late 1970 \u2019 s would be part of a scheme to supply huge amounts of C4 explosives and special forces advisers to Libya in order to gain intelligence to the revolutionaries and nationalists that Gaddafi allowed to train there and in the hopes of stealing soviet weapons systems .\nWilson was carrying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIA but they denied any connection to him .\nHis business partners Secord , Shackley , and Clines had grown envious of the vast wealth he had amassed running CIA front companies .\nOnce Reagan became president Libya was falsely blamed for a number of terrorist attacks like the Belle disco attack and the Lockerbie bombing .\nThe US would wage a proxy war on Libya via Chad , and shoot down Libyan aircraft and boats attempting to defend their territorial waters during American war games .\nThe campaign would culminate in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would wound his wife and 7 children and kill his adopted baby daughter .\nDozens of civilians would also be killed .\nThis occurred in 1986 during the height of the Iran Contra scandal and Oliver North who was also the terror Czar was a key planner of the attacks .\nGaddafi would survive until the 2011 NATO war when Libya was bombed into submission while Al Qaeda contras seized the country .\nLebanon was another country that was key to understanding the Iran Contra affair .\nIsrael saw it as a key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yinon style plans to balkanize the middle east .\nLebanon was divided along religious lines and it \u2019 s political parties each represented a different faction .\nThe Christians minority held disproportionate power , the Sunnis were divided into pro-western and pro-arab nationalist factions , the Shiite \u2019 s were under represented .\nAt one point in the mid 70 \u2019 s left wing Arab Nationalists were on the verge of seizing power and Kissinger had convince Hafez Assad to prevent their victory in order to prevent an Israeli invasion .\nLebanon was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exiles who had been forced to flee Jordan after the events of \u201c Black September \u201d when Jordan had launched a brutal crackdown .\nThe Israelis encouraged the Christian Fascists to seize power and failing that break away and form their own country .\nThis lead to the Lebanese civil war .\nIn 1978 Israel invaded southern Lebanon but the Carter administration convinced them to withdraw .\nIn 1982 Israel would invade again this time with the support of the Reagan administration they kidnapped a number of visiting Iranian officials and of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lebanese just as it has arrested imprisoned and tortured untold numbers of Palestinians over the decades .\nIn 1982 Iran sent the IRGC into Lebanon to help train Hezbollah .\nIsrael captured Beirut and installed the Christian Phalange as president .\nHe was assassinated and in revenge thousands of Palestinians cordoned off by the Israeli army were massacred by the Christian Phalange in Sabra and Shatila .\nThe US pretended neutrality but sided with Israel .\nThe marines were sent in and the US navy began shelling Lebanese villages .\nIn 1983 Hezbollah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bombings .\nIn 1984 it began kidnapping Americans to use as leverage to free the 17 Da \u2019 awa prisoners in Kuwait who had attacked French and US targets there .\nThey had also kidnapped the CIA station chief William Buckley who was tortured into revealing decades of dirty secrets .\nThe stage was set for the Iran arms for hostages deals .\nOf course the stage had already been set during the October surprise negotiations that got Reagan elected in the first place .\nIsrael would be the middle man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early Iran Contra arms deals .\nEgypt would be the middle man in the Iraqgate arms deals .\nThe course of the Iran-Iraq war would be prolonged as the US supplied arms to both sides nearly 1 million Iraqis and Iranians would die .\nThe US supplied Iraq Intelligence so it could use it \u2019 s chemical weapons to best effect against Iran .\nThen in 1986 the us began supplying Iran with intelligence that shifted the balance of the war .\nThe fallout of the Iran Contra affair would lead to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started authorizing huge loans and weapons shipments to Iraq while encouraging Kuwait to provoke Iraq , Bush had the State department give Iraq the green light to invade Kuwait .\nfollowed by sanctions which killed another million , followed by the invasion and occupation of Iraq , and the intentional creation of a sectarian civil war that would claim at least a million more lives .\nThe Iran Contra era saw the seeds planted that would more recently bloom into many more recent wars .\nThe invasion of Iraq , the destruction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syria .\nIn the case of Syria the US and Israel had helped launch a muslim brotherhood uprising in 1983 with the aid of Iraq that would eerily mirror the Syrian war of 2011 to today .\nAnd then of course

Thanks to Dr. T. P. Wilkinson The Iran/Contra scandal is so complex that I \u2019 ve decided to separate the Nicaragua and Iran parts into separate articles .\nMany of the cast of characters introduced in this article will reappear in the next .\nNames like National Security Advisers Robert McFarlane and John Poindexter , Oliver North , Richard Secord , Albert Hakim , Thomas Clines , and Duane \u201c Dewey \u201d Clarridge .\nIsrael would play an important role in both Central America and the Middle East .\nAnd of course President Ronald Reagan , Vice President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would play major roles in both scandals .\nThe CIA and National Security Council having assembled \u201c the Enterprise \u201d to wage an illegal war on Nicaragua in 1984-1986 employing private contractors who were ex-military or CIA Secord , Clines , Hakim .\nThe NSC would employ the same enterprise to handle logistics in the Iran arms deals starting in the fall of 1985 .\nThis is the mainstream version .\nOn the other hand the true origins of the \u201c Enterprise \u201d went back to much earlier middle east arms deals .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early 1960 \u2019 s and returned in the late 1970 \u2019 s supervising the Pentagon \u2019 s Military Assistance Program to the Shah \u2019 s Iran .\nSecord was also suspected of being a partner in EATSCO with Thomas Clines , Ted Shackley and Ed Wilson .\nBy beginning the story in Nicaragua I am not implying that this is the true origins of the affair .\nHowever since this article is on the mainstream version of the Iran-Contra affair I will not attempt to trace the history of the Iran Contra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure in 1986 as the Christic Institute attempted to do in their civil case against \u201c The Secret Team \u201d which inspired my earlier series on the Iran/Contra scandal and my biography of Ted Shackley .\nI will merely comment that Secord and Clines had both been deeply involved in running covert operations with drug smuggling allies in places like Laos and Vietnam .\nI plan to do a whole series on the Contra drug connection next year so I will not deal with that aspect of the scandal in depth here .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ were deeply involved in drug smuggling .\nMore all of the US right wing military dictatorships like Guatemala , El Salvador , Argentina , and Chile as well as nominally democratic but brutally repressive countries like Colombia , Mexico and Honduras were all involved in drug smuggling .\nAll received tacit permission and CIA protection for this massive drug trade .\nIt is a pattern that has continued long after the cold war nor is it restricted to Latin America .\nSouth East Asia , Central Asia , the Middle East , Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their stories of CIA protected drug trades and the CIA is not unique intelligence agencies around the world are involved in the global drug trade .\nIt \u2019 s all so obvious that it would be widely known if not for the cowardice of most academics and journalists or more accurately their role in propagandizing the public on behalf of the empire .\nThe war on drugs like the war on terror is a complete farce but few dare to point out this fact .\nThe United States invaded and occupied Nicaragua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep order when they left .\nAnastasio Somoza was the head of this force and always eager to please his American sponsors .\nHe seized power in 1936 and his family would rule till it was overthrown by the Sandinistas July 17 1979 .\nThis was during the Jimmy Carter presidency .\nCarter \u2019 s record in Central America was rather more sinister then the myth of his supposed obsession with human rights would suggest .\nHe authorized a massive escalation in military aid to El Salvador in his final years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off military aid to Somoza however because his refusal to negotiate and brutal war crimes endangered the US \u2019 s ability to manage the transition of power .\nCarter hoped to use the promise of aid to keep the Sandinistas in line .\nTheir were doubtless secret plans to undermine them at the same time there is always a \u201c Track 2.\n\u201d Little aid was delivered but Carter \u2019 s policies were viewed as treacherous and weak by future President Ronald Reagan .\nIn the fantasy world of Reagan and the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a popular revolution but a sinister soviet plot to dominate the western hemisphere .\nDestroying Nicaragua and preventing revolutions in El Salvador and Guatemala would become major priorities of the new administration .\nReagan \u2019 s election in 1980 amounted to a soft coup as I discussed in my introductory article involving illegal campaign contributions from rich oligarchs in El Salvador and Guatemala who were given the green light to commit atrocities and mass murder .\nThese schemes involved Michael Deaver future Contra supplier Major General John K. Singlaub and Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allen .\nThe Reagan campaign also sent emissaries to the Contras .\nMost importantly the Reagan campaign made a deal with Khoemeini \u2019 s faction to prevent the release of the American hostages in Iran the so called \u201c October surprise \u201d which personally involved George .\nH.W .\nBush , Bill Casey , Richard Allen and future National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane among other key players in the Iran Contra scandal .\nI \u2019 ll expand on this in the Iran Section .\nWhen Reagan came to power in 1981 he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn the fall of 1981 the Contras were a tiny force of 250 men mostly veterans of Somoza \u2019 s National Guard in exile in Guatemala under the protection of the \u201c Godfather of the death squads \u201d Mario Sandoval Alarcon .\nOthers Contras were in exile in Honduras .\nHonduras would be the Contras main future base backed by the Honduran military , Argentine advisers fresh from their dirty war in Argentina and the Bolivian Cocaine coup , and Cuban bay of pigs Veterans .\nThe future contras were also living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alliance with the Cuban exiles .\nThey engaged in terror attacks , drug dealing bank robbery and kidnapping to finance their counter-revolution some survived by armed robbery and stealing livestock .\nThey had named themselves the 15th of September Legion .\nThis was the situation in fall of 1981 when the Reagan administration began it \u2019 s war on Nicaragua .\nIn August of 1981 Duane \u201c Dewey \u201d Clarridge the new head of the CIA \u2019 s Latin America division was sent down to Honduras to meet with the Honduran military who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Argentine Advisers .\nClarridge was a veteran of Operation Gladio in both Turkey and Italy .\nDCI Casey had picked him despite the fact that he didn \u2019 t speak Spanish , because he was a reckless \u201c cowboy \u201d used to operating above the law doing whatever dirty work was necessary .\nClarridge operated under the alias Maroni while the contras jokingly called him \u201c GarCIA \u201d .\nClarridge would run the Contra war until mid 1984 when his harbor mining and assassination scandals would alienate congress and eventually get them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of being fired Casey would promote him to the even more prestigious position of head of the European division .\nIn November of 1981 Reagan signed NSDD 17 authorizing a full scale covert war on Nicaragua .\nOn December 1 1981 Reagan would sign a Presidential Finding on Nicaragua meant to deceive congress on the full scope of what he was up to .\nIn the wake of the CIA scandals of the 1970 \u2019 s and the congressional investigations a system of oversight was put into place , House and Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in order to conduct a covert operation a president had to sign a Presidential finding and inform congress within 30 days .\nReagan and Bill Casey planned a massive expansion of the CIA and in order to get congress to agree they had included oversight and the need for presidential findings in the bill .\nThis would be an important legal detail later in the scandal .\nCasey despised the idea of congressional oversight keeping congress in the dark as much as possible .\nCasey even wanted to exempt the CIA from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every day a CIA officer resigned over fear their name might be revealed in a FOIA request .\nReagan would conduct covert operations without signing the proper findings which could have gotten him impeached .\nIn this case Reagan \u2019 s finding on Nicaragua was a deceptive cover story .\nKnowing that Congress wouldn \u2019 t approve their plan to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government Reagan and Casey created the cover story that they merely wanted to create a 500 man force to interdict arms going from Nicaragua to the El Salvadoran guerrillas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the fact that they were already working to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government .\nBill Casey was a key architect of the Iran-Contra affair and the mastermind of the Reagan doctrine that America must wage covert war on any socialist or independent minded country or as they put it \u201c aid freedom fighters around the world.\n\u201d Casey \u2019 s father worked in the sanitation department but was extremely well connected to the Irish political machine in New York .\nCasey became a lawyer and an expert on corporate law and tax evasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHe joined the OSS during the war running intelligence in the European theater .\nHe loved his job but decided to leave the government and make his fortune .\nActually Casey was part of a network of old ex-OSS men who ran CIA front NGO \u2019 s like in Casey \u2019 s case the International Rescue Committee and the Crusade for Freedom covers for their work with fascist emigres .\nAnother group of ex-OSS men ran the media and Casey would later acquire huge media holdings .\nThanks to Casey \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the creation of the concept of the tax shelter he got rich .\nHe remained active in politics and was rewarded for his support for Nixon with the position of head of the SEC , The Export Import Bank , and the State Department \u2019 s economic division .\nHe turned down the job Deputy Director of Operations for the CIA offended they hadn \u2019 t offered him the director spot .\nFinally Reagan was convinced to hire Casey as his campaign manager and he ran the campaign like a covert op @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other dirty tricks .\nHe wanted to be rewarded with the position of Secretary of State or Defense but was rejected because he was a notorious slob and a mumbler .\nInstead he became CIA director which was elevated to a cabinet post .\nHe would oversee a massive expansion of the CIA and would also push for a massive expansion of the military \u2019 s special forces .\nHe was impatient with the CIA \u2019 s bureaucracy and despised the analytical division for throwing cold water on the anti-soviet hysteria the Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole division replacing them with analysts who would toe the party line .\nYet he fully realized how vulnerable the Soviet Union was and helped engineer it \u2019 s downfall .\nTo get around CIA red tape Casey like to rely on private businessmen and other cut outs .\nTo be closer to the President Casey had opened office in the Executive Office Building close to Oliver North \u2019 s .\nNorth met with Casey regularly and Casey was a major influence over National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane .\nNorth would report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iran Contra project .\nJust as the Iran/Contra scandal was breaking Casey \u2019 s brain cancer incapacitated him and he was sent to a CIA approved hospital for radical brain surgery which left him conveniently unable to communicate .\nHe died a few months later .\nThe war on Nicaragua would escalate in a major way spring 1982 .\nNow renamed the FDN and having the full support of the CIA the contras launched 106 attacks between March 14 1982 and June 21 1982 .\nThey blew up the bridges connecting Honduras and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began sniper attacks on Nicaraguan troop convoys .\nAlso in 1982 the CIA would recruit Eden Pastora who played a heroic role during the revolution but turned traitor .\nHe would relocate to Costa Rica where his much smaller force ARDE would attempt to open up a southern front .\nLate in 1982 the CIA would recruit 8 civilians with anti-Somoza reputations to serve as the FDN \u2019 s civilian directorate in an attempt to defuse criticism that the FDN were made up of entirely of Somoza \u2019 s National Guard who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were carrying out equally horrific crimes against Nicaragua with CIA backing .\nThis was only a small part of the psychological warfare strategy the Reagan administration was waging on the US public and the world at large .\nIn 1982 Casey would transfer veteran CIA propagandist Walter Raymond Jr. to the NSC to run the Intelligence division and begin launch a Public Diplomacy campaign .\nPublic Diplomacy ( like the term public relations ) was the latest euphemism for propaganda and psychological operations .\nRaymond led the campaign to ensure that Reagan \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America would become the prevailing wisdom .\nRaymond and his lackey Otto Reich who would be in charge of the State Departments office of Public Diplomacy for Latin American affairs or S/LPD would wage war on investigative journalists .\nThe press was used to \u201c Following the State Department line.\n\u201d Now if they failed to follow that script by exposing war crimes in Central America , Otto Reich might personally arrive to bully their editors or producers .\nOliver North worked closely with Raymond and Reich attending over 70 meetings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result .\nThey also spread wild rumors about journalists critical of administration policy accusing female journalists of having Sandinista lovers and male journalists of being supplied by the Sandinistas with prostitutes of either sex .\nNorth went further telling the FBI Robert Parry had poisoned his dog which had died of old age .\nThey also set up a network of journalists who were actually secretly on the state payroll to print opinion pieces in the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal .\nLater they would also illegally fund the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Channell , Richard Miller , and Frank Gomez who were also working closely with Oliver North raising money to buy arms for the Contras and illegally lobby Congress .\nRaymond \u2019 s main goal was \u201c to paint black hats on the Sandinistas and white hats on the Contras \u201d in the process he managed to effectively kill investigative journalism by the end of the 1980 \u2019 s according to Robert Parry one of his victims .\nRaymond called it \u201c Project Truth.\n\u201d Perhaps it is time to fully introduce Oliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over at the NSC while \u201c Dewey \u201d Dewey Clarridge was running the Contra war .\nIn 8th grade he had been sent away for a year of military school despite being a very well behaved kid .\nLater after attending a marine training camp in High School he became obsessed with joining the marines , attended the Naval Academy , became an officer in the marines and happily went to Vietnam his one worry was that the war would end before he could get there .\nNorth was a true believer never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lead a platoon in Vietnam .\nAfter serving his tour returned to testify on behalf of a friend who had helped massacre a village in an incident the press dubbed \u201c The Marine Corps \u2019 s My Lai \u201d .\nWhile waiting to testify North joined a black ops marine intelligence unit on night time missions assassinating the Vietnamese on what was basically his vacation .\nNorth got his first taste of fame when he and several marines signed a letter claiming that in all their time in Vietnam they had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights violation by either American or South Vietnamese forces .\nThis was an absolutely absurd lie but it got him invited onto ex-CIA media pundit William F. Buckley \u2019 s talk show .\n( Not to be confused with the CIA station chief William Buckley kidnapped in Beirut ) North began training marines in Counter-Insurgency both in the States and in Okinawa .\nWhen his wife threatened to leave him he had a nervous breakdown in 1974 and threatened to commit suicide muttering \u201c I \u2019 m no good \u201d and waving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovered his wife didn \u2019 t leave him .\nThe whole incident was covered up later allowing him to be picked for the NSC .\nIn 1975 he was assigned to marine headquarters in the manpower division where he befriended the top brass .\nHe was promoted to major and assigned to Camp Lejeune .\nIn 1978 after a superior officer gave him a faith healing of his leg North became an enthusiastic born again Christian raised catholic he now joined a charismatic Episcopalian church .\nThis would prove useful in the Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Christian Right to drum up support for the Contras and joining the influential Council on National Policy ( CNP . )\nIn 1980 he was sent to the Naval War College .\nIn1981 National Security Adviser Richard Allen picked North to join the NSC .\nAllen would be replaced by National Security Adviser William Clark an old Reagan crony from his days as Governor of California and the NSC suddenly had a lot more access to Reagan .\nClark would be replaced by his deputy Robert McFarlane who had been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to China .\nMcFarlane hoped to emulate his mentor Kissinger raising the power of the National Security Adviser .\nLike North McFarlane was a marine and they soon formed a close father and son type relationship fueling North \u2019 s meteoric rise .\nOne of North \u2019 s first assignment was to lobby for the AWACS sale to Saudi Arabia when he met Richard Secord who was also deeply involved with the AWACS sale over at the Pentagon .\nNorth was assigned to work on Continuity of Government planning where he worked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martial law and round up tens of thousands of anti war activists and hundreds of thousands of Central American refugees in the event of civil unrest in response to the invasion of Nicaragua .\nReagan had dreamed of instituting martial law back when he was Governor of California waging war on Anti-war protestors , Black and Latino radicals and others .\nLuis Giuffrida as head of California Specialized Training Institute was a key mastermind of this plan called Cable Splicer .\nAs president Reagan appointed Luis Giuffrida to run FEMA .\nIn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expand from post-nuclear war scenarios to terror attacks or even civil unrest .\nIn 1984 Oliver North would use the Rex-84 exercise as part of a scheme to funnel \u201c surplus \u201d weapons to the Contras .\nThe 1980 \u2019 s Continuity of Government plans would form the blueprint for the government response to 9/11 .\n\u201c Paranoia \u201d over FEMA camps would continue for decades on the far right .\nIronically back in the 1980 \u2019 s the plan was to recruit the militia movement to serve as State Defense Forces who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American refugees and for decades right wing militias have been allowed to terrorize refugees at the borders .\nNorth also began to take an increasing interest in Central America serving under Roger Fontaine on the NSC eventually replacing him as the NSC point man in charge of Central America .\nNorth would serve on the Kissinger Commission which drew up a blueprint for continuing Reagan \u2019 s dirty war in Central America .\nSoon North was serving as the NSC representative on the RIG the Restricted Interagency Group on Central America where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative .\nEventually the RIG composed of Oliver North of the NSC , CIA Central America Task Force chief Alan Fiers , and Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Elliot Abrams would run Central American policy also supervising Walter Raymond \u2019 s Public Diplomacy campaign as the RIG triumvirate or RIGlet .\nHaving introduced North let \u2019 s return to \u201c Dewey \u201d Clarridge \u2019 s Contra war back in late 1982 .\nIn December 1982 in response to the massive expansion of the Contras , their aggressive attacks , reports of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Costa Rica ( which since it was to Nicaragua \u2019 s south could not play any role in the cover story of interdicting arms heading for El Salvador ) Boland I was passed it forbade the Reagan administration from using the Contras to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government .\nReagan signed it and DCI Casey merely ignored it since he could deny that his goal was to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government up until he actually succeeded in doing so .\nInstead his worry was that the war was behind schedule .\nIn 1983 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Contra war .\nIn 1983 Dewey Clarridge commissioned the Contra handbook \u201c Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare.\n\u201d which the press would later dub the \u201c assassination manual \u201d or \u201c the murder manual \u201d it argued for selective terror against loyal Nicaraguans and assassinating contras to create martyrs .\nIgnoring Boland I it called for the overthrow of the Nicaraguan Government .\nIt would cause a scandal when exposed by journalist Robert Parry .\nIn May of 1983 Reagan for the first time openly praised the Contras as freedom fighters and bragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would later claim \u201c I am a Contra.\n\u201d and compare them to the US founding fathers .\nHe was serving as the mouthpiece for the public diplomacy campaign which advised claiming that the contras were freedom fighters fighting for democracy when they might more accurately described judging them by their tactics and origins as bloodthirsty death squads and terrorists pining for the days when Nicaragua was run by a fascist dictator .\nThe Contras massacred peasants , raped , tortured , and killed in the grisly manner favored by CIA trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an machetes .\nThe Contras blew up buildings and burned down hospitals and grain silos .\nThey terrorized not just Nicaraguans but Hondurans , and Costa Ricans .\nBy summer 1983 it had become clear that \u201c Dewey \u201d Clarridge wouldn \u2019 t be able to meet his deadline to topple the Sandinistas by Christmas 1983 .\nCuban and Soviet economic aid were preventing the US sanctions and economic warfare from collapsing the economy .\nNicaragua was successfully repelling the contra attacks .\n\u201c Dewey \u201d Clarridge came up with a plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the Contras weren \u2019 t up to the job he would have the CIA do it themselves utilizing UCLAs or Unilaterally Controlled Latino Assets Cuban-Americans , Mexican Americans , and Puerto Ricans who were military and probably special forces veterans but who if killed could be passed off as Nicaraguans .\nHe purchased a huge mothership as a base for a fleet of speedboats and starting in fall 1983 began trying to destroy Nicaragua \u2019 s oil infrastructure .\nOn September 8 1983 the UCLAs attacked an oil pipeline and docks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UCLAs set fire to the oil storage facility in Corinto forcing the entire town to evacuate .\nIn December of 1983 as a compromise between those who wanted to end all aid to Contras and those who wanted it to continue Congress voted to put a 24 million limit on aid to the Contras in Fiscal Year 1984 .\nUndeterred Dewey Clarridge presented a plan to Casey to mine Nicaraguan harbors an act of open warfare under international law .\nCasey and Reagan gave Dewey Clarridge the green light .\n\u201c Dewey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take responsibility although in reality it was the CIA \u2019 s UCLAs who carried out the mining .\nThe mining began on January 1st and lasted till April 24 1984 .\nCasey claimed he had properly informed Congress but since he was a mumbler and it was buried in the middle of his testimony no one had noticed .\nWhile Casey had mentioned the mining he had lied and said the Contras had carried out the mining .\nIn any case when the press reported the mining in April of 1984 it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent nearly all the Contras 24 million 1984 budget on the mining and other attacks and when the scandal broke Clarridge was in South Africa begging for arms and cash to fund the Contras .\nSouth Africa was willing to send arms and money since it was working closely with the US running it \u2019 s own Contra style wars against Angola and Mozambique against Nicaragua \u2019 s Cuban allies in the case of Angola .\nThe Reagan administration decided that because of the mining scandal it should avoid further controversy by involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong supporter .\nEventually the Harbor mining scandal and the assassination manual scandal would lead to the passage of Boland II in October 1984 .\nIn the meantime Reagan would order his National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane to find a way to keep the Contras together \u201c Body and Soul \u201d even if Congress cut them off .\nMcFarlane picked his protege Oliver North to run the operation .\nIt had been planned to hand the contra war over to the NSC back in 1983 when the 24 million spending cap was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Israel to take over the Contras .\nThe Israelis had basically taken over for the US in Guatemala although the US was secretly still heavily involved there and McFarlane hoped they would play a similar role advising the Contras .\nIsrael refused for fear of endangering their bipartisan stranglehold on the US congress but they would play a key role in arming the Contras .\nDewey Clarridge introduced North to the Contra leaders as the new point man on the Contra Operation .\nCasey suggested North recruit Richard Secord to run the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to meet with the Contra \u2019 s and obtain \u201c a shopping list \u201d of weapons and supplies they needed .\nSecord would be in charge of weapons procurement charging a 38 % markup to the Contras .\nHis partner Iranian exile Albert Hakim began setting up a network of shell companies like Energy Resources International , Lake Resources , Udall corp , and Amalgamated Commercial Enterprises in addition to the shell companies and fronts they \u2019 d already set up as part of their business like Stanford Technology Group .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u201c Project Democracy \u201d the dark underbelly of the newly created National Endowment for Democracy .\nStandard operating procedure in shadowy world of military contractors , arms dealers , offshore bankers , private intelligence firms , transport specialists , and crisis management populated by ex-spies , ex-military operating under the unofficial protection of the US and other governments .\nSoon Secord hired his old EATSCO partner Thomas Clines to handle the arms deal when his first deal involving Canada \u2019 s Transworld Arms and China faced delays over the fake Guatemalan end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guatemala was a close ally of Taiwan .\nClines source was Defex of Portugal whose board had close ties to Clines .\nClines would bring in CIA Cuban and assassin Rafael \u201c Chi Chi \u201d Quintero to run things on the ground in El Salvador .\nAnother key member of the Enterprise was Rob Owen supposedly a civilian .\nOwen \u2019 s brother was in the State Department ( or possibly CIA ) and was killed in Vietnam .\nOwen went to work for the International Rescue Committee a CIA front in Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff .\nCIA rancher John Hull paid him a visit and Owen became obsessed with helping the Contras .\nHe went to work for CIA tied Gray & Co a PR firm owned by Robert Keith Gray who had long worked with the CIA in looting Latin America .\nThe Contras tried to hire Gray & Co to do their PR but the deal was vetoed by a former Kennedy aid .\nOwen quit and went to work for the FDN and soon became North \u2019 s courier to the Contras .\nOwen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammer \u201d and \u201c Old Blood and Guts.\n\u201d Owen ran his own one man pro-contra NGO IDEA .\nIn addition to setting up a privatized network to cope with reduced CIA involvement it was necessary to find a new source of funds .\nNational Security Adviser Robert McFarlane turned to the Saudis meeting with Ambassador Bandar Bin Sultan ( aka \u201c Bandar Bush \u201d ) in May of 1984 .\nAmbassador Bandar Bin Sultan agreed to supply 1 million a month to the Contras with the permission of King Fahd .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double their donation after President Reagan met with King Fahd .\nThe Saudi \u2019 s gave a total of 32 million .\nWACL head retired General John Singlaub and Oliver North eventually convinced Taiwan to donate 2.7 million .\n\u201c Dewey \u201d Clarridge had gotten the South Africans to provide arms money and advisers but the deal was canceled or delayed do to the harbor mining scandal .\nSouth Africa did supply millions to the network of cold war lobbyists and new right propagandists the Reagan Administration relied on to sell their policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressional opponents critical of the Contras and other Reagan policies .\nIn 1986 prior to the scandal breaking Elliot Abrams convinced the Sultan of Brunei to give 10 million to the Contras but due to a supposed clerical error by Fawn Hall North \u2019 s secretary the money ended up instead in the Swiss bank account of Israeli expat Bruce Rappaport a shadowy figure ( ie connected to organized crime , big business , intelligence and the Israeli labor party ) who was a key element in the Iraqgate schemes to build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had promised to pay tens of millions to Israeli politicians for the promise not to blow up the Iraqi pipeline .\nAbrams blanket denials to congress when questioned on whether the State Department was soliciting 3rd country donors saying \u201c We are not in the fundraising business \u201d would almost land him in prison .\nThe Reagan Administration would solicit aid from over two dozen countries on behalf of the Contras .\nIt was also vital to keep Central American countries supportive of the Contras a policy that was as unpopular in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTheir support was maintained via illegal quid pro quo deals .\nThe Reagan administration could only ask for aid to the Contras if there were no strings attached , if congress was informed and if there was a presidential finding .\nPresident Reagan and Vice President Bush would personally violate the law intervening with heads of state in Central America offering quid pro quos and threatening aid cut offs .\nIf the countries agreed to support the Contras they would get huge increases in military and economic aid .\nIf they tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened with aid cut offs .\nIn El Salvador and Guatemala these arms shipments would be used in their US backed dirty wars on peasants and workers that would claim 300,000 lives .\nMexico was home to Contra training camps under the protection of the infamous Guadalajara cartel that were considered so sensitive that DEA agent Enrique \u201c Kiki \u201d Camarena Salazar and Mexico \u2019 s top investigative journalist Manuel Buendia were both murdered to cover it up .\nBuendia was assassinated by Mexico \u2019 s CIA trained DFS .\nBush \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Kiki \u201d Camarena as the cartel tortured him to death .\nGuatemala was used to supply fake end user certificates for the Enterprise \u2019 s Contra arms deals .\nEl Salvador \u2019 s Ilopongo airbase would be the supply depot for the Contras as Honduras didn \u2019 t want direct supply flights from the US .\nBush \u2019 s National Security Adviser Donald Gregg had sent Felix Rodriguez to El Salvador as an adviser on using helicopter strike teams in their dirty war in the countryside as well as to run the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run a similar program under Gregg in Vietnam when they were in the CIA .\nRodriguez had formed a tight bond with the El Salvadoran Air Force General Juan Rafael Bustillo .\nBefore leaving for El Salvador Rodriguez met with Bush and then SouthCom Commander in chief Paul Gorman who flew Rodriguez down to Ilopongo .\nEventually Rodriguez would clash with the Enterprise .\nHonduras was the Contras main base and the US was constantly forced to intervene whenever Honduras would threaten to withdraw support or jealously seize Contra weapon shipments of surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Contras but not Honduras .\nVice President Bush personally flew to Honduras as Reagan \u2019 s special envoy to offer Honduras a quid pro quo to Honduran President Suazo .\nAmusingly at an earlier National Security Planning Group meeting Bush had warned the cabinet that such quid pro quos were illegal .\nThe Honduran military who worked closely with the Contras were also involved in a massive drug smuggling operation .\nHonduran General Jose Bueso-Rosa was busted in Florida and $ 40 million dollars in cocaine was seized by the FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use this drug deal finance the assassination of Honduras \u2019 new President .\nOliver North and Elliot Abrams lobbied on his behalf to get the charges dropped and when that failed to get him a lighter sentence in a minimum security prison .\nThey were worried General Bueso-Rosa might expose the illegal contra resupply operation .\nPanama was a key Contra supporter General Noriega \u2019 s main adviser was Michael \u201c Mad Mike \u201d Harari a notorious Mossad veteran who was making a fortune supplying Panama \u2019 s air force with US parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smuggle cocaine to the US .\nA longtime CIA asset Noriega donated tens of millions to the Contras along with his bussiness partner Harari in exchange for the US \u2019 s ignoring his involvement in drug smuggling and money laundering .\nPanama would supply an explosives expert to ex-SAS British Mercenary David Walker for an attack that blew up an arms depot in downtown Nicaragua that sparked a fire destroying a nearby military hospital .\nJust prior to the Iran/Contra scandal breaking Oliver North met personally with Noriega on a plan to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s PR problems in exchange for Noriega \u2019 s help launching terror attacks on Nicaragua .\nNoriega offered to loan the US teams to carry out assassinations .\nThe plan also called for setting up a Contra training base in Panama where Panamanian and Israeli advisers would create a western front in the Contra war targeting the capital Managua .\nNoriega was having PR problems because Sy Hersh had exposed Noriega \u2019 s drug empire in the New York times a couple months before .\nCasey and Bush had also held personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host to a much smaller Contra force then Honduras but was even more resistant to supporting the Contras .\nIt was home to secret airstrips to supply the Contras the most infamous being John Hull \u2019 s Ranch where drugs were smuggled , mercenaries housed , and the La Penca bombing was allegedly planned .\nThe La Penca bombing took place May 30 1984 .\nPastora had refused to merge his forces with the FDN ignoring a CIA ultimatum .\n8 people were killed including 3 journalists one of them an American Linda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avirgan .\nAvirgan and his wife Martha Honey would investigate the bombing and the trail lead to John Hull \u2019 s Ranch and meeting attended by North \u2019 s courier Rob Owen and CIA station chief Joe Fernandez .\nHull had been plotting Pastora \u2019 s assassination for months who he viewed as a \u201c Commie.\n\u201d Mercenaries who frequented Hulls ranch claimed that there was also a plot to kill Ambassador Lewis Tambs and blame Nicaragua as a pretext for a US invasion .\nIt would also allow the Contras to collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had put on Tambs .\nAvirgan and Honey sought the aid of the Christic Institute when Hull sued them for Libel and tried to frame them as drug traffickers .\nEventually they became the plaintiffs in the Christic Institute civil lawsuit of the Iran Contra conspirators .\nCosta Rica was also home to the Santa Elena airstrip which North had the Enterprise purchase through the dummy corporation the Udall Research Corporation set up by North \u2019 s friend ex-marine William Haskell under the fake name Robert Olmstead .\nNorth \u2019 s alias throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goode \u201d Secord \u2019 s was Richard Copp .\nCopp Goode and Olmstead were listed as the board of directors of Udall Research Corp .\nThe Airstrip was built through the efforts of Ambassador Lewis Tambs and CIA chief of Station Joe Fernandez .\nThe Costa Rica \u2019 s Minister for Public Security Benjamin Piza was on the CIA payroll and was the airstrips Costa Rican protector .\nHis reward was a trip to DC for a personal photo op with Reagan .\nCIA chief of station Fernandez would blatantly violate the Boland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers supervising arms drops .\nCharges were later dropped against Fernandez when the CIA refused to cooperate .\nWhen Oscar Arias was elected President of Costa he ordered Santa Elena shut down but his government ignored him .\nEventually in 1986 his government would raid Santa Elena and expose the Udall corporation despite the panicked efforts of the Reagan Administration .\nArias would later win the Nobel prize for his Arias Peace plan the blueprint for ending Central America \u2019 s bloody dirty wars .\nIn addition to seeking donations and support from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundraising network raising illegal tax free donations for the Contras , funding a vast domestic propaganda campaign on behalf of Reagan \u2019 s Central American dirty wars and engaged in illegal meddling with congressional elections .\nCarl \u201c Spitz \u201d Channell was the key fundraiser setting up a network of NGO \u2019 s like the NEPL ( The National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty ) and ACT ( The American Conservative Trust .\nHis network was closely tied with that of Richard Miller and Frank Gomez who ran IBC ( International Business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by NEPL and the US State departments S/LPD ( Latin American Public Diplomacy . )\nNorth would be his unofficial partner North would give a sales pitch in the form of an intelligence briefing often at his NSC offices .\nNorth was a great salesman he could reduce donors to tears .\nThen after explaining what the Contras needed and what it cost he would exit the room and Channell would ask for a donation .\nThe biggest funders were right wing widows like Ellen Garwood the Contras named the helicopter she bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she donated millions to Channell .\nHollywood had this elderly widow played by Julia Roberts in Charlie Wilson \u2019 s war as she was also a key backer of the Afghan Mujahideen .\nThe second biggest donors were infamous right wing billionaires like Nelson Bunker Hunt and Joseph Coors who had been funding a vast network of warmongering , racist , sexist and homophobic NGO \u2019 s for decades .\nHunt , Coors and other men gave hundreds of thousands to the NEPL .\nDonors who gave over $ 300,000 were rewarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNorth wrote them thank you notes on NSC stationary , and sent them commemorative souvenirs , while Channell would send the lonely widows gift baskets for the holidays .\nThe NEPL raised $ 3.9 million in 1985 and $ 7 million in 1986 .\nThe NEPL spent half the money it raised on $ 5 million in consulting fees and salaries for Channell and his cronies .\nA quarter went to the Contras via Secord \u2019 s Lake Resources Swiss accounts $ 2.7 million .\nAnother $ 2.3 million funded the \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in states with swing votes on Contra funding .\nThey also funded a vast domestic propaganda campaign on behalf of the Contras .\nAlthough the public remained opposed in 1985 Congress gave in and voted for 27 million in \u201c Humanitarian Assistance \u201d to the Contras .\nIn summer 1986 their lobbying campaign would convince congress to vote 100 million in lethal aid to the Contras .\nHowever there was a 3 month delay before the funds became available so the illegal resupply operation continued and was exposed on October 5 1986 when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Contras relied on 3 main arms dealers , \u201c The Arms Supermarket \u201d , Secord \u2019 s Enterprise , and Singlaub \u2019 s GeoMiliTech .\nAs North and Secord \u2019 s affairs became more entangled and corrupt North forced the Contras to buy solely from \u201c The Enterprise \u201d and even put \u201c The Enterprise \u201d in charge of all the Contras funds .\nThe Arms Supermarket had been set up with the support of Vice President Bush , and his National Security Adviser Donald Gregg who sent Felix Rodriguez to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 14 million in drug money ( according to North ) and was run by Ronald Martin , James McCoy Mario Dellamico another Cuban exile .\nIt ran a massive warehouse with millions of dollars in weapons It was closely allied to the Honduran Military via Col. Hector Aplicano and the Israelis .\nThe Arms Supermarket was implicated in the death of money launderer and cuban exile John F. Molina who was killed by a Colombian hit team in Panama .\nGeoMiliTech ( GMT ) was owned by Barbara Studley a former beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a strange company it partnered with both China and Israel to supply Chinese and east bloc weapons to \u201c Contras \u201d waging covert wars around the world in Afghanistan , Ethiopia , Cambodia and of course Nicaragua .\nThey also bought East Bloc arms from Austrian arms dealer Werner Glatt who supplied the CIA with East Bloc Weapons .\nGMT became an exclusive dealer of certain Israeli weapons system and had offices in Israel .\nGMT supplied 5.3 million in weapons to the Contras .\nBehind Barbara Studley were General John K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the DIA .\nSinglaub had been forced to retire as head of US and Korean forces in South Korea after publicly criticizing President Carter \u2019 s troop reductions in South Korea .\nHe had served in the OSS in China and Europe , the CIA and the military in Korea and had headed the Special Operations Group in Vietnam ( SOG-MACV . )\nHe had started the new US WACL branch the USCWF the US Council on World Freedom and would be elected to head WACL worldwide The World Communist League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and former nazis , right wing politicians , drug dealing asian dictators , and Latin American death squad heads like Mario Sandoval Alrarcon and Roberto D \u2019 Aubuisson .\nIn the 1980 \u2019 s WACL was a vehicle for implementing the Reagan doctrine of global \u201c low intensity warfare \u201d generating solidarity among fascists worldwide and support for World War 3 as they called the \u201c cold war \u201d .\nThe Ukrainains had actually long argued for the need to start a nuclear war to \u201c liberate \u201d eastern europe .\nWACL was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s enterprise funneling private donations to the Contras .\nSinglaub sent millions in non-lethal aid to the Contras on behalf of WACL .\nSinglaub was very tight with Taiwan and South Korea who funded the US chapter of WACL and who he would approach to solicit donations with North and McFarlane \u2019 s permission .\nWhen the Hasenfus flight was shot down exposing the illegal contra resupply operation Elliot Abrams tried to blame the whole thing on Singlaub who angrily denied it .\nGeoMiliTech would later go bankrupt in the 1990 \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Enterprise purchased it \u2019 s weapons from DEFEX in Portugal arms bought with fake Guatemalan end user certificates .\nAround June 28 1985 North called a meeting of Contra leaders in Miami including Adolfo Calero and Richard Secord .\nNorth set the stage by tearing into Adolfo Calero about corruption and incompetence in Contra ranks .\nThen he announced that from then on the Enterprise would be in charge of the Contras funds .\nHe also announced The Enterprise would set up a system to airdrop arms to Contras in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run the Enterprise \u2019 s private air force later replacing him with the more competent Robert Dutton .\nAll 3 had been involved in planning Carter \u2019 s failed hostage rescue back in 1980 that ended in disaster .\nGadd set up a shell company to rent planes from \u201c former \u201d CIA airline SAT Southern Air Transport which had a long history of drug trafficking .\nIt took a while to get going and many of the air drops had to be canceled because the Contras failed to signal or the pilots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but eventually weapons were being dropped airdropped or unloaded in Honduras , Costa Rica , and within Nicaragua itself .\nSoon the Contras had more arms then they could carry .\nIt was all based in Ilopongo military airbase .\nThe CIA owned one hangar while North \u2019 s Enterprise controlled the other .\nFelix Rodriguez , and Colonel James Steele the head of US advisers in El Salvador ( who would later set up death squads in Iraq ) worked with the Salvadorans and the Enterprise pilots .\nAlso there was Cuban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a Cubana airliner in 1976 killing 73 people .\nAnother CIA Cuban in Ilopongo was Rafael \u201c Chi Chi \u201d Quintero working for Tom Clines .\nPredictably Ilopongo became a major drug smuggling hub .\nIn 1985 Congress had caved in and voted $ 27 million in \u201c humanitarian assistance \u201d to the Contras .\nThe CIA and the military were barred from having anything to do with it so the State Department set up the NHAO Nicaraguan Humanitarian Assistance Office run by Robert Duemling .\nHowever unknown to Congress , Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fiers and Elliot Abrams of the RIG .\nThey forced him to hire Rob Owen and soon the NHAO was hiring the enterprise as well as known drug traffickers to carry \u201c humanitarian assistance.\n\u201d NHAO flights were run out of Ilopongo and Felix Rodriguez did not bother to keep the NHAO operation separate from the enterprise .\nBy day they were NHAO flights by night the same planes and pilots were used to fly arms .\nIn late1985 North got the idea to use the proceeds of the Iran Arms sales to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan adopted North and Poindexter \u2019 s plan to cut the Israeli \u2019 s out of the Iran arms deals having the Enterprise act as the middleman .\nThe diversion idea soon was put into place although Secord and Hakim didn \u2019 t send the Contras as much as North wanted giving them around $ 3.5 million instead of the $ 12 million North had originally envisioned in the \u201c Diversion Memo \u201d .\nThey had operating costs and of course wanted to make a hefty profit .\nNorth the true believer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself when he had funneled the Saudi money to the Contras Cayman bank account controlled by Adolfo Calero , Calero had then sent North $ 100,000 in travelers checks North could use to cover expenses North used this slush fund however he pleased giving out travelers checks to Rob Owen and Fawn Hall and spending them on himself .\nNorth also had Secord buy him an electric gate installed by ex-CIA man Glen Robinette .\nSecord had also hired Robinette to dig up dirt on Tony Avirgan and Martha Honey down in Costa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albert Hakim set up a 200,000 dollar trust for North \u2019 s children in the event of North \u2019 s death .\nBy fall of 1986 100 million in congressional funds were about to become available .\nEarlier in the year Reagan North and Abrams had come up with a \u201c Plan B \u201d if Contra aid failed to pass they would have had the Contras seize a strip of Nicaraguan territory defended by the Guatemalan and El Salvadoran militaries which the US would then recognize as an independent state allowing Reagan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAbrams would later adapt this scheme for Venezuela recognizing Juan Guiado as Venezuela \u2019 s president so they could seize all the countries assets .\nHowever Walter Raymonds Public Diplomacy and the NEPL contra lobby managed to pressure congress into passing the 100 million in aid .\nNorth was relieved he had only been sleeping 3 or 4 hours a night for years he was so busy .\nHe was starting to go a bit crazy McFarlane and his replacement John Poindexter worried .\nNorth hoped the CIA would buy the Enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Enterprise would be redeployed into a new theater in the war perhaps Africa .\nThe Reagan administration was on the verge of getting away with blatantly violating the Boland amendment .\nIt had been exposed in the press back in 1985 and again in 1986 but the press backed off once Congress decided to accept North , McFarlane , and Poindexter \u2019 s lame denials .\nOn October 5th 1986 one of the Enterprise planes flown by Buzz Sawyer and William Cooper flew from Ilopongo , down Nicaragua 's coast into Costa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 year Sandinista with a soviet surface to air missile launcher shot the plane down .\nEugene Hasenfus \u201c the kicker \u201d was the only one wearing a parachute and managed to jump out of the crashing plane wandering the jungle before being captured the next morning and paraded around the capital and in front of international television .\nFelix Rodriguez had been the 1st to break the news of the missing flight calling the Vice Presidents office Donald Gregg was out so he told Gregg \u2019 s aide Sam Wilson .\nNorth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s when he got the news .\nThe plane had once belonged to infamous CIA drug smuggler Barry Seal .\nSeal had been killed February 19 , 1986 by a Colombian hit squad after threatening to expose the Contra resupply operation and Vice President George H.W .\nBush .\nAfter their arrest the Colombian \u2019 s said they were taking orders from a Lt. Col. they later identified as Oliver North .\nThat story would be buried .\nThe mainstream version was that Seal was killed by the Colombians after being exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North \u2019 s scheme to frame the Sandinista \u2019 s for drug trafficking .\nHasenfus testimony provoked a media firestorm by claiming he was working for the CIA and naming \u201c Max Gomez \u201d .\nThe press discovered the phone records of one of the enterprise safe houses showing calls to the NSC .\nReagan , Secretary of State Schultz , and Elliot Abrams all went public denying any government connection to the Contra resupply operation .\nAbrams went on CNN and issued one of his trademark blanket denials even when asked specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Congress he had no idea who \u201c Max Gomez \u201d was so did the CIA \u2019 s Deputy Director of Operations Claire George who held in his hands a briefing book identifying Max Gomez as Felix Rodriguez .\nMeanwhile the entire Enterprise air force was supposedly flown out of El Salvador to the US where it was buried with massive quantities of explosives blown up then set on fire .\nI find it a little hard to believe since usually these CIA drug planes are transferred from shell company to shell company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet again many in the media and Congress choose to accept administration denials of involvement in supporting the Contras in violation of the Boland Ammendment , ignoring the mountains of evidence implicating the Reagan Administration .\nIt was only when the Iran deal was exposed the next month and Attorney General Ed Meese exposed the \u201c diversion \u201d of profits to the Contras that the scandal would finally explode .\nEd Meese had seized on the diversion memo to divert attention from Reagan \u2019 s involvement in the illegal Iran arms sales of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidential finding and which violated the arms export control act which if exposed could potentially lead to President Reagan \u2019 s impeachment and jail time for many of the Iran-Contra conspirators .\nAt least that \u2019 s what might have happened if American \u2019 s truly lived in a democracy rather then a national security state .\nI will deal with the Iran arms for hostage deals in part 3 .\nMalcolm Byrne \u2019 s Iran-Contra : Reagan \u2019 s Scandal and the Unchecked Abuse of Presidential Power is the definitive mainstream version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cocaine , The Press & Project Truth by Robert Parry gives many details left out of mainstream accounts .\nHe has an in depth discussion of the Contra drug connection as well as the role of drugs in Panama and Honduras .\nHe also discusses the Reagan Administration Public Diplomacy campaign that destroyed investigative journalism in the US .\nTheodore Draper wrote the earlier definitive mainstream account back in the 1990 \u2019 s \u2018 A Very Thin Line : The Iran Contra Affairs \u201d It is longer and more detailed then Byrne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinister past ( former communist turned anti-communist scholar for various CIA funded fronts ) that makes him all too willing to trust the CIA and fail to dig deeply into the scandal .\nHe never mentions drugs .\nStill it \u2019 s worth reading for anyone interested in the Iran side of Iran Contra .\nFirewall : The Iran Contra Conspiracy and Cover-Up by Lawrence E. Walsh the Independent Counsel in The Iran-Contra Investigation offers a long account of his offices investigation and prosecution of Oliver North and other Iran Contra Conspirators .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ case slowly unravel and Walsh \u2019 s investigation revealed a great deal that Congress failed to uncover and he gradually begins to have more evidence about the role of then President George H.

second element in the Iran-Contra scandal were the arms for hostages deals .\nAt the time they were the most controversial aspect of the scandal .\nIran and it \u2019 s ally Hezbollah had inflicted a series of humiliations on the US that began during the Iranian Revolution and escalated during the war on Lebanon .\nThe Iran Hostage Crisis , the US embassy bombing in Beiruit , the kidnapping of CIA Chief of Station William Buckley and most dramatically the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut .\nThe US had branded Iran a state terror sponsor and the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pressure the whole world to stop selling arms to Iran .\nThe US was allied with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Monarchs in backing Iraq in the Iran/Iraq war .\nReagan had publicly called Iran \u201c Murder Incorporated \u201d and claimed the US would never negotiate or make concessions with terrorists .\nYet at the same time as Reagan was publicly condemning Iran the US was supplying them with thousands of anti-tank missiles , helping Iran rebuild it \u2019 s air defenses and providing it with intelligence that managed to shift the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s favor .\nThis was all in an effort to free seven American hostages in Beirut .\nOf course the deeper geopolitical purpose was to prolong the Iran/Iraq war making it as bloody and destructive as possible a goal the Israeli Mossad veteran David Kimche openly admitted .\nPresident Ronald Reagan over ruled objections from his own cabinet to carry the deal out .\nEven when warned that he could face impeachment and prison Reagan pushed for the deals to continue .\nAmong Reagan \u2019 s cabinet only Vice President George H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistently supported the continuation of the arms for hostage deals .\nAt a lower level North and Secord once they were brought in on the deals , also consistently backed the plans as they benefited \u201c The Enterprise.\n\u201d Secord was able to turn a profit while North was able to funnel money to the Contras in Nicaragua .\nThe Iran-Contra investigations failed to investigate the true origins of the Iran arms for hostages deal .\nFirst there had been the role of the Shah \u2019 s Iran as one of the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex .\nIn the final years of the Shah \u2019 s reign Richard Secord had headed the Military Assistance program in Iran helping his arms dealing friends generate vast profits .\nWhen the Iranian revolution overthrew the Shah the Rockefeller family interests in the form of Chase Manhattan bank were worried the new Iranian government might withdraw the hundreds of millions Iran had deposited in their bank .\nThey had helped to launch the career of President Carter \u2019 s National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski .\nBrzezinski convinced Carter to allow the exiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBack in Iran many thought the US was preparing to launch another coup like the one that had toppled Mossadegh and installed the Shah back in 1953 .\nIn protest of the US admission of the Shah and in hopes of finding out what the US was plotting a group of Iranian students seized the embassy .\nThey captured 52 Americans on the embassy staff officials of the state department , the CIA , and the military .\nThey also seized all the files documenting decades of US support for the Shah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people .\nThe Hostage Crisis began on November 4 1979 .\nPresident Carter retaliated by freezing Iran \u2019 s overseas accounts allowing Chase-Manhattan to keep Iran \u2019 s money .\nThis at least is one simplified version of events the Iranian revolution was far more complex then most realize and in fact went through two stages .\nFirst the initial overthrow of the Shah by broader movement that included left wing forces and nationalists .\nSecond the triumph of Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic revolution .\nAlso there is evidence that the rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were manipulated by western intelligence .\nIran \u2019 s mullahs had long been on the CIA payroll since the days of the 1953 coup .\nIran is by no means a puppet of the US or it \u2019 s allies .\nIran remains one of the few countries willing to stand up to the US and Israel .\nHowever despite the hostile rhetoric from both sides secret deals were made between the US and Iran .\nPresident Jimmy Carter began a year of efforts to rescue or negotiate the release of the hostages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration he was being targeted for a soft coup by the GOP , disgruntled elements of the CIA , and big business in the form of David Rockefeller and his allies .\nIt became known as the \u201c October Surprise \u201d a term for last minute manipulations in October aiming to alter the election results in November .\nThe GOP were obsessed with the idea Carter would free the hostages in October 1980 swinging the election in his favor .\nYet the GOP began to manipulate events far earlier then October 1980 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Khomeini faction took place at least as early as March 1980 .\nReagan \u2019 s campaign manager was OSS veteran Bill Casey .\nCasey set up an October Surprise group to monitor Carter \u2019 s efforts to free the hostages .\nElements within the Carter administration like Donald Gregg at the NSC and Robert Gates at the CIA were leaking information to Casey .\nBush had his own CIA agents for Bush contingent which included Robert Gambino .\nMany CIA agents for Bush would join Casey \u2019 s October surprise group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate .\nTo negotiate with Iran Carter \u2019 s administration had picked Cyrus Hashemi .\nCyrus and his brother Jamshid Hashemi had close ties to Mehdi and Hassan Karrubi in Iran .\n( Hassan Karrubi and Cyrus Hashemi would both be deeply involved in the Iran Contra scandal . )\nThe Hashemi brothers were also close to Admiral Madani who was the main rival of Iran \u2019 s President Bani Sadr .\nUnknown to Carter Cyrus Hashemi had close ties to Bill Casey through Lebanese American businessman John Shaheen .\nCasey had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shaheen for decades .\nCyrus Hashemi became a double agent for the Reagan campaign initially providing them intelligence on Carter \u2019 s negotiations and then acting as a middleman to set up negotiations between Casey and the Iranians .\nCyrus Hashemi \u2019 s bank First Gulf and Trust had been used by the CIA , the Shah \u2019 s Family , and the new Iranian government to move money .\nIt had close ties to BCCI an infamous CIA backed bank whose clients included drug cartels and terrorists .\nA series of meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crony Earl Brian ( who served as Secretary of Health under Governor Reagan ) and Robert \u201c Bud \u201d McFarlane ( who would later set the Iran Contra arms for hostage deals in motion ) along with Bill Casey met in Madrid with Iranian Mehdi Bazargan ( Close to Hashemi \u2019 s contact Mehdi Karrubbi ) to arrange a deal whereby Iran would refuse to release the hostages until after the election in exchange for massive

in Madrid .\nAfter meeting with Khomeini Karrubi requested another meet with Casey that was held in August 1980 .\nMeanwhile the Carter administration was working from a hard bargaining stance completely unaware that the Iranians had already gotten a better offer from the GOP .\nOn April 24 1980 the US mounted a disastrous rescue attempt \u201c Operation Eagle Claw \u201d either through bad luck , incompetence , or sabotage it ended in complete disaster when two of the helicopters crashed in the Iranian desert landing zone called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US military died in the crash the others were forced to flee as they no longer had enough helicopters to carry out the rescue .\nThe corpses of the dead Americans were paraded through Tehran enraging the US public and humiliating Carter .\nRichard Secord , Robert Dutton , and Richard Gadd future members of \u201c The Enterprise \u201d were all involved in the hostage rescue plans .\nThe failure would lead to a massive re-expansion of the Special Forces that began under Carter growing under Reagan and continuing to expand into our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s luck was finally poised to change .\nIran \u2019 s President Bani Sadr had learned of the GOP \u2019 s secret deal with Khomeini and planned to go public on September 8 1980 .\nTo keep him quiet Khomeini agreed to reopen negotiations with the US .\nIran was also worried about an increasingly hostile Iraq .\nKhomeini sent Sadegh Tatabani to make a deal and Carter \u2019 s negotiators seized on the opportunity .\nYet once again Brzezinski \u2019 s machinations would sabotage Carter .\nBrzezinski had convinced Saddam Hussein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war began on September 22 1980 and Tatabani was unable to return to Iran because Iraq was bombing the Tehran airport .\nIn late September or early October the Iranians would meet with GOP representatives at the L \u2019 Enfant Plaza Hotel in Washington DC where Israeli Housang Lavi , Americans Richard Allen , Robert McFarlane , and Lawrence Silberman met with Iranian representatives .\n( President Reagan would later appoint Silberman a judge and Judge Silberman would overturn North and Poindexter \u2019 s Iran Contra convictions ) The DC meeting was followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris October 17-18 1980 attended by Bill Casey and Vice Presidential Candidate George H.

Iranians to hold onto the hostages until after the election .\nNow it wanted Iran to hold onto them even longer so that Reagan could come into office with a boost in popularity .\nTo cement the deal a French Israeli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 23 1980 consisting of 250 F4 spare tires and M6 tank spare parts .\nOn November 4 , 1980 the US election was held on the one year anniversary of the start of the hostage crisis Carter lost to Reagan .\nOn January 20 , 1981 Reagan was inaugurated President and the hostages were released .\nThe US was soon supplying Iran with hundreds of millions in arms through Israel , South Korea and it \u2019 s NATO allies .\nIsrael used it \u2019 s knowledge of the \u201c October Surprise \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly a billion dollars in arms in 1981-1983 .\nNaive Americans believed the strange coincidence of the hostages being released on the day of the inauguration was because of Reagan \u2019 s tough stance on terrorism .\nBy massively expanding Carter \u2019 s war in Afghanistan Reagan and Casey would play a major role in giving birth to Al Qaeda .\nThe Reagan years would also see the origins of the same rhetoric and tactics of the later \u201c War on Terror.\n\u201d Although Reagan did not personally take part in the October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on the secret .\nIt is the only way to explain his obsession with pursuing the Iran-Contra arms for hostage deals despite their quickly evolving into a farce filled with lies and broken promises .\nThe October Surprise would be covered up by Congress and most of the media .\nThe October Surprise story has been confirmed by dozens of witnesses from around the world including former President Bani Sadr , Ari Ben Menashe , Ariel Sharon , Yasser Arafat , Alexandre DeMarenches ( former head of French Intelligence and close Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iranian Government offered to send proof to Bill Clinton .\nIn the years that followed the bloody Iran-Iraq war would continue eventually claiming over a million lives .\nThe US was busy supplying Iraq with arms via Egypt and the CIA provided the Iraqis intelligence to plan their attacks .\nIn 1982 Israel invaded Lebanon and installed a puppet government .\nThe Israeli \u2019 s had sparked the Lebanese civil war back in 1975 encouraging their fascist christian phalange allies to try to seize control of the country .\nSouthern Lebanon was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shell Israel .\nThe Israelis were even more annoyed with them when the Palestinians maintained a ceasefire .\nIn 1978 Israel had invaded and occupied Southern Lebanon but Carter had forced them to withdraw .\nNow with Reagan in office in 1982 Israel invaded Lebanon eventually creating a puppet state in Southern Lebanon .\nSouthern Lebanon was also home to a huge Shiite population and with the aid of Iran \u2019 s IRGC they formed Hezbollah in 1982 .\nThe US became increasingly involved in Lebanon siding with the Israelis and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt would take Hezbollah nearly 20 years to force Israel to withdraw from Lebanon .\nHezbollah would force the US to withdraw in just 1 year .\nOn April 18 1983 Hezbollah set off a van packed with explosives outside the US embassy 63 were killed .\nA dozen high level CIA personnel including their top Mid-East analyst Robert Ames who Casey had sent to Beirut .\nRobert McFarlane was sent as a special emissary to Beirut and he escalated US involvement in the war shelling and bombing Lebanese civilians .\nThen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bombed in Beirut by a huge truck bomb .\n241 members of the US military were killed .\nThe US claimed it wouldn \u2019 t pull out but quietly did .\nTo distract the US public the US launched the Invasion of Grenada where it had just carried out a coup .\nOliver North helped plan the invasion .\nOn March 7 1984 CNN journalist Jeremy Levin was kidnapped .\nThen on March 16 1984 the CIA station Chief William Buckley was kidnapped by Hezbollah on the way to work he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torture .\nHis capture and worry over what he might reveal was a major factor in motivating the US to trade arms for hostages .\nBuckley would tell all to the Iranians and they transcribed his confession into a 400 page book .\nBuckley would die before he could be freed .\nSix more American hostages would be kidnapped by Hezbollah or it \u2019 s front groups in Beirut between May 8 1984 and June 9 1985 .\nThey were Reverend Benjamin Weir , Peter Kilburn ( librarian at American University ) Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Terry Anderson ( AP journalist ) David Jacobsen ( Hospital Director at American University ) and finally Thomas Southerland ( Director of Agriculture at American University ) They were kidnapped to gain leverage to free the Dawa prisoners being held in Kuwait after a series of attacks on American and French targets there .\nTheir kidnappings would provide the motivations or the excuse for the US to carry out the arms for hostage deals .\nExcept for Jeremy Levin would seemingly escape after being ransomed .\nA key factor behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a web of groups set up by Vice President George H.W .\nBush that dealt with Crisis management and Counter-Terrorism .\nIt was thanks to the key role that North played in the counter-terror network or as Peter Dales Scott calls it \u201c a Cabal \u201d that North became not just the point man for the Contras but also in charge of counter-terrorism and eventually in charge of the Iran arms for hostages negotiations .\nThe \u201c Cabal \u201d included Admiral John Poindexter ( NSC ) , Oliver North ( NSC ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Charles Allen ( CIA ) , Robert Oakley ( State Department ) , Noel Koch ( DOD ) Lt Gen John Moellering ( Joint Chiefs of Staff ) and Oliver \u201c Buck \u201d Revell ( FBI ) .\nThey communicated via \u201c Flashboard \u201d a secret email system .\nNSDD ( National Security Directive ) 3 had put Vice President Bush in charge of crisis management back in 1982 .\nBush recruited North and his secretary Fawn Hall to work on crisis management .\nThis lead to North drawing up Continuity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suspending the constitution , total surveillance , and rounding up tens of thousands of dissidents and hundreds of thousands of refugees in the event of nuclear war , terror attacks , or even civil unrest .\nDonald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney would also be involved in these plans during the Clinton administration .\nThey formed the blueprint for America \u2019 s post 9/11 response .\nBush also created a Crisis Preplanning group and a Special Situations Group .\nNorth worked on the creation of a Crisis Management Center .\nIn April of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TIWG ( Terrorist Incident Working Group ) 2 TIWG members would work closely with North , Craig Coy and Robert Earl .\nIn July of 1985 President Reagan convened the Vice President \u2019 s Task Force on Combatting Terrorism .\nAt the exact same time the US suddenly reversed it \u2019 s Iran strategy opening the door for the Iran arms for hostage deals Peter Dale Scott points out .\nOn January 20 86 just as the US was preparing to make direct arms sales to Iran NSDD 207 put North in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret Office to Combat Terrorism run by Oliver North staffed by veterans of Bush \u2019 s Counter-terror cabal .\nMichael Ledeen and the Israeli Amiram Nir were also part of this counter-terror network and like North would play major roles in the Iran Contra Scandal along with Robert Oakley and Dewey Clarridge .\nThrough counter-terror network Bush and North became close .\nThanks to this shadowy network within the government Bush became as deeply embroiled in the Iran side of the scandal as he had been in the contra side .\nIt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a bunch of shell companies .\nThe bloodiest incident in North \u2019 s war on terror was the attempt to assassinate a Hezbollah leader Muhammed Hussein Fadallah with a car bomb 80 people were killed in the attack but Fadallah survived .\nNow it \u2019 s time to introduce North \u2019 s bosses at the NSC Robert \u201c Bud \u201d McFarlane and John Poindexter .\n\u201c Bud \u201d McFarlane was the son of democratic congressman in Texas .\nHe graduated from Annapolis Naval Academy in 1959 , was commissioned as a marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat unit in Vietnam .\nHe studied in Switzerland and received a White House Fellowship .\nAl Haig Henry Kissinger \u2019 s deputy at the NSC brought on McFarlane as his military assistant .\nMcFarlane came to regard Kissinger as his mentor and McFarlane was involved in his secret negotiations with China .\nMcFarlane would later hope that his Iran initiative would earn him a similar place in history .\nHe retired from the marines as a Lt .\nColonel and served two years on the Senate Arms Services Committee under Senator John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the October Surprise and was picked by Reagan to investigate/Cover-up the Iran Contra scandal .\nOnce Reagan was President he picked Al Haig as his Secretary of State .\nHaig brought McFarlane on as a Counselor to the State Department .\nThen with Haig on the way out as Secretary of State McFarlane returned to the NSC as National Security Advised Willam Clark \u2019 s deputy .\nWhen Clark stepped down as National Security Adviser the Ed Meese , Michael Deaver , and Jim Baker faction called the \u201c Troika \u201d which dominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Baker as the new National Security Adviser .\nBaker was a close friend of George H.W .\nBush who has become infamous as the Bush family \u201c Fixer.\n\u201d Bill Casey blocked the appointment and McFarlane was chosen as the National Security adviser as a compromise .\nSince \u201c Bud \u201d McFarlane and Ollie North were both marine Lt. Colonels serving on the NSC and both workaholics they developed a sort of father son relationship and McFarlane came to rely ever more on North .\nMcFarlane was also a longtime friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign Ministry David Kimche .\nMcFarlane put great trust in the advice of Bill Casey .\nMcFarlane trust in both Casey and Kimche would lead him to plunge into the disastrous Iranian arms for hostage deals .\nVice Admiral John Poindexter was McFarlane \u2019 s deputy at NSC and would succeed him as National Security Adviser in early December 1985 .\nHe was born in a small farming town in Indiana .\nHe graduated top of his class at Annapolis Naval Academy then received a PHD in nuclear physics from the California Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretaries of the Navy and as executive assistant to the Chief of Naval Operations Admiral James Holloway .\nHe also commanded a guided missile cruiser and a destroyer squadron .\nPoindexter was recruited to set up the computer network for Bush \u2019 s Crisis Management Center .\nHe had IBM install a prototype version of the Internet at the NSC allowing North and the other Iran Contra conspirators to email each other via PROF messages .\nThe NSC crisis management network linked the NSC computer network to the computer networks of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , numerous law enforcement agencies , military bases around the world and foreign intelligence services .\nThis was a few years before anyone in the general public knew what an email was .\nThis would come back to haunt Poindexter , North and others when they deleted all their PROF messages only to have some low level research assistant to the Tower Committee figure out how to recover them all .\nOn the internet nothing is ever really deleted .\nPoindexter was secretive and a bit more reckless then McFarlane .\nAt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would save Reagan by testifying to Congress ( almost certainly falsely ) that Reagan had not been informed of the diversion of funds from the Iran arms sales to the Contras .\nAdnan Khashoggi the Saudi Billionaire who the press dubbed \u201c the world \u2019 s wealthiest man \u201d had made a fortune being a CIA conduit for bribes to middle eastern officials to buy American weapons systems .\nHe was famous for his yachts , lavish parties and high class call girl ring .\nOne of Khashoggi \u2019 s call girls would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nKhashoggi was close friends with Donald Trump and sold him a yacht .\nAdnan was the uncle of Jamal Khashoggi who made news when he was murdered in a Saudi Embassy in Turkey on orders of King Muhammed bin Salman back in 2018 .\nBetween 1983 and 1984 Khashoggi met frequently with \u201c Bud \u201d McFarlane at NSC trying to sell him on various schemes .\nIn late 1984 Khashoggi would team up with Manucher Ghorbanifar on a scheme to sell arms to Iran in order to free the hostages .\nIran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied tanks were smashing them on the battlefield .\nIraq was bombing Iran and Iran was running out of missiles and parts for it \u2019 s air defense system .\nIt would later emerge during the Iraqgate investigations that Vice President Bush had provided intelligence and encouragement for Iraq to bomb Iran to pressure Iran during the arms for hostage scheme but this was probably later .\nManucher Ghorbanifar the middleman in the Iran arms deals was an arms dealer who had served in Savak , become an Israeli agent , and supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreliable they issued a burn notice on him as a known fabricator after he failed too many lie detector tests .\nThe Iranians were desperate enough for weapons that they were willing to use a known Israeli agent like Ghorbanifar .\nGhorbanifar would become infamous for lying to both the Americans and the Iranians to get them to the bargaining table .\nGhorbanifar \u2019 s Iranian contacts Hassan Karrubi and Mohsen Kangarlou had been involved in the earlier October Surprise negotiations .\nGhorbanifar hoped to make millions off the Arms deals .\nOliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Ghorbanifar practicing that special American brand of bullshitting necessary to the salesman or the sports coach .\nDesperate to gain the confidence of the American \u2019 s after the CIA had discarded him Ghorbanifar met with Theodore Shackley in Hamburg Germany on November 20 1984 .\nGhorbanifar warned ( falsely ) that Iran was in danger of becoming a soviet satellite in 5 years .\nGhorbanifar wanted to buy TOW anti-tank missiles and offered to free the kidnapped CIA station chief William Buckley and to provide captured soviet equipment to the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management firm Research Associates Inc. and was closely monitoring the Iran-Iraq war .\nShackley had hired an Iranian named Razmara who introduced Shackley to the former head of the Savak \u2019 s Counter-Intelligence General Manucher Hashemi in October 1984 and Hashemi had arranged the meet with Ghorbanifar .\nAccording to veteran CIA Iran operative George Cave Shackley was working for the NSC .\nShackley was also working for Vice President George H.W .\nBush while ostensibly in the private intelligence business .\nShackley was close to both Secord and Clines his \u201c former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a memo on November 22 1984 and sent it to Vernon Walters Reagan \u2019 s ambassador at large and fellow CIA veteran infamous for his role in the 1964 coup in Brazil .\nWalters forwarded the memo Robert Oakley the State Department \u2019 s point man on counter-terrorism ( Part of the Bush/North Counter terror network ) and to Assistant Secretary of State for the Near East Richard W. Murphy .\nBecause of Ghorbanifar \u2019 s dubious reputation the offer was initially rejected .\nBy March 1988 Shackley \u2019 s memo landed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably falsely ) that he never read it but forwarded it to Oliver North .\nLedeen was another of Shackley \u2019 s friends from the October Surprise days .\nMichael Ledeen would jump start the languishing Iran arms for hostages deal .\nLedeen was a CIA press asset , a contractor for Italy \u2019 s SISMI intelligence agency along with Shackley .\nIn Italy Ledeen would help cover up GLADIO and spread the myth of the Soviet Union being behind all the world \u2019 s terror attacks .\nLedeen had close ties to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neo-con , and had earlier befriended Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres when Ledeen was sent to infiltrate the socialist international of which Peres \u2019 s Labor Party was a member .\nCurrently Ledeen was a consultant on counter terrorism at the NSC .\nLedeen got McFarlane \u2019 s permission to travel to Israel to explore using Israel \u2019 s contacts to gain intelligence on Iran .\nOnce in Israel the Israelis introduced Ledeen to the Iranian Manucher Ghorbanifar , the Saudi Adnan Khashoggi , along with two Israeli arms dealers Adolph Schwimmer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disinformation to sell Ledeen along with the promise to free the seven American hostages .\nThe disinformation was that Iran was in danger of falling into the soviet orbit , but that Ghorbanifar was in contact with a pro-western faction that hoped to take power once Khomeini was dead .\nSupposedly Iran was divided into 3 factions a pro-soviet faction , a neutral faction , and a pro-western faction .\nGhorbanifar promised to put the US in contact with the \u201c Moderates.\n\u201d In reality Iranian politics in the Islamic republic had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war dynamics .\nThere were no pro-soviet factions and no pro-american factions .\nBack in 1983 a Soviet defector had supplied the CIA with a complete list of KGB assets and Casey decided to send the list to Iran .\nKhoemeini had them killed or arrested .\nHowever like most countries Iran was ruled by ruthless pragmatists who were willing to buy arms from Israel or the US because of the Iran-Iraq war .\nArms procurement was controlled by Iran \u2019 s IRGC the revolutionary guard but they were used to operating through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhile in Israel Ledeen also met with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and David Kimche the director general of the Israeli Foreign ministry a Mossad veteran .\nKimche would go on to advise the greatest mass murderer of recent times Rwanda \u2019 s President Paul Kagame in the 1990 \u2019 s .\nKimche would fly to Washington DC to meet with McFarlane a couple weeks after Ledeen \u2019 s return .\nWhen Ledeen met with the Israeli Prime Minister Peres vouched for Ghorbanifar , Khashoggi , Schwimmer , and Nimrodi and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Bud McFarlane.\n\u201d Schwimmer was a major backer of Peres and the Iran deal was meant to reward him .\nThe Labor party had been cut out of the lucrative arms market by the Likud party , the Mossad , and the Israeli defense department and Peres hoped that with US backing his cronies could get into the Iran arms sales business .\nReturning to the US Ledeen briefed McFarlane on the arms for hostage deal and passed on Peres \u2019 s message .\nMcFarlane bought the cover story on Iranian moderates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the US orbit he would earn his place alongside his mentor Kissinger in the history books .\nCIA director Bill Casey encouraged this delusion he intentionally kept the CIA \u2019 s top Iranian analysts reports from reaching the NSC lest they discredit the cover story about selling arms to Iranian moderates .\nInstead Casey had Graham Fuller ( later infamous for his role backing al Qaeda style groups in Central Asia ) write a report calling for a complete reversal on US policy towards Iran .\nSoon the NSC had a draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would enable the Iran arms for hostage deals to go forward .\nNow it was a decision for the President and his NSPG ( National Security Planning Group a modified NSC . )\nThe idea was strongly opposed by both Secretary of State George Schultz and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger .\nCasey , McFarlane , and Vice President Bush supported the arms for hostages scheme .\nThe idea got a boost in June 1985 when Iran and Syria helped negotiate the release of the TWA 847 hostages being held in Beirut after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front Islamic Jihad .\nIsrael freed hundreds of shiite prisoners it was holding in exchange .\nThe deal was brokered by Iranian speaker of the parliament Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani who was also a key player behind the scenes on the arms for hostage deals .\nThe decisive voice belonged to President Ronald Reagan and he was in favor of going ahead .\nPresident Reagan gave the final green light to McFarlane on July 13 1985 while in the hospital recovering from a polyp operation .\nManucher Ghorbanifar had promised to free all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missiles were delivered .\nIsrael was to act as the middle man it would ship TOWS from it \u2019 s own stocks and the US promised to send replacements .\nTo finance the deal Ghorbanifar borrowed $ 1 million from Khashoggi .\nYaacov Nimrodi and Al Schwimmer charged Ghorbainfar $ 10,000 for each missile .\nThe Israeli Defense Ministry sold them to the two Israeli arms dealers for only $ 6,000 each .\nGhorbanifar charged Iran $ 12,000 for each TOW .\nOn August 20 1985 Israel delivered 96 TOW missiles to Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their stockpile .\n( apparently TOWs are shipped in 8 packs ) On landing in Iran the IRGC immediately seized the TOWs .\nNo hostages were released .\nGhorbanifar used the excuse that since the IRGC not the \u201c Moderates \u201d had gotten the missiles the moderates hadn \u2019 t freed any hostages .\nHowever Ghorbanifar had a new deal for 400 more TOW missiles plus the 4 TOWs Israel owed them from the first shipment Iran would get a hostage freed .\nAmazingly the arrogant US agreed to this second deal after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time .\nOn September 15 , 1985 Israel delivered 408 TOWs to Iran .\nWithin hours the hostage Reverend Benjamin Weir was released .\nThe US had hoped to free CIA station chief William Buckley first , Casey had even played Reagan a video of Buckley being tortured .\nThe Iranian \u2019 s claimed Buckley was to ill to travel in reality he had died in June of 1985 .\nIran now hoped to rebuild it \u2019 s air defenses with the next deal .\nThe Iranians were now demanding HAWK surface to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US refused to sell the Phoenix missiles which it didn \u2019 t even supply to most of it \u2019 s allies .\nIt agreed to sell the HAWKs however .\nThe deal was for 120 IHAWK missiles Iran would pay 18 million or $ 225,000 each .\nIHAWKS were the more advanced version .\nThe plan was for Israel to ship them to Iran via Portugal .\nThis is when Oliver North was recruited to run the Iran arms for hostages deals .\nAt first McFarlane had put North in charge of replenishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the arms control summit in Geneva .\nHowever Portugal was refusing permission to allow the missiles to land and take off from their country .\nOn November 17 1985 Israeli defense minister Yitzhak Rabin called North to fix the problem and McFarlane called soon after to confirm that he had referred Rabin to North .\nNorth brought in Secord who \u2019 s partner Tom Clines had close contacts with the Portuguese arms company DEFEX .\nHowever DEFEX had strong ties to the party that had recently been voted out of office instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal quickly turned into a fiasco .\nSecord \u2019 s attempt to hold an unscheduled meeting with the foreign minister at the airport only upset Portugal .\nThe US embassy was ignorant of the deal and told Portugal not to approve it .\nNorth brought in Duane \u201c Dewey \u201d Clarridge serving as the CIA \u2019 s head of European operations to get the CIA \u2019 s help in pressuring Portugal .\nAl Schwimmer lost patience and tried to send the plane in without clearance hoping the problem would be solved before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn around and it \u2019 s lease ran out .\nThe Israeli \u2019 s agreed to pay Secord \u2019 s \u201c Enterprise \u201d 1 million for transport .\nDewey Clarridge called Langley to get the name of a CIA controlled airline St. Lucia .\nThis would raise also sorts of legal problems once the scandal broke .\nTo engage in a covert operation the CIA needed a Presidential finding .\nAnyways the St. Lucia plane was smaller then the one Schwimmer had rented and could carry fewer missiles .\nSecord arranged for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then over Turkey to Iran .\nCyprus didn \u2019 t give official permission but someone probably paid off the right people as no one interfered .\nOn November 25 , 1985 18 HAWK missiles arrived in Iran .\nThe Iranians were furious they were not the IHAWKS they had been promised but the less advanced HAWKS and Israel hadn \u2019 t bothered to scrape off the \u201c stars of David \u201d on them .\nGhorbanifar called North in a panic warning the Iranians were furious and the hostages lives were in danger .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ more cautious deputy director John McMahon demanded that a \u201c retroactive \u201d Presidential finding be created to cover for the CIA .\nA retroactive finding was created and signed by President Reagan December 5 1985 and then thrown into an NSC safe .\nThe whole point of a finding was to inform congress and there was not supposed to be any such thing as a retroactive finding .\nOn December 4 1985 President Reagan had announced that McFarlane was resigning as National Security Adviser to be replaced by Admiral John Poindexter .\nMcFarlane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms deals he wanted all the hostages freed first before more weapons were sent and was beginning to realize that he had been duped about the possibility of installing a \u201c moderate \u201d government in Iran .\nAfter the scandal broke in November 1986 Poindexter would burn the retroactive finding because it clearly showed an arms for hostage deal .\nNorth had another scheme to free the hostages alongside the Iran arms for hostages deal .\nTwo DEA agents William Dweyer and Frank Tarallo had come to North with a scheme to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major drug trafficker to act as middle man in arranging to ransom the hostages .\nNorth turned to Texas Billionaire H. Ross Perot to provide the ransom .\nPerot made his money in electronics and so had tight ties with the intelligence community .\nDuring the Iran hostage crisis he had managed to free 4 of his employees .\nThere were a couple attempts to ransom a hostage in Beirut ending in failure .\nThe first try the informant claimed he had spent $ 300,000 in bribes and was suspected of pocketing some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned to treat the ransom with a chemical that would cause the money to disintegrate days later a scheme which would have damaged all future hostage negotiations .\nFinally the deal fell through when the informant demanded a million dollars up front .\nThe DEA men refused .\nPerot was very angry over the failure but was consoled with a personal letter from Reagan thanking him for his efforts .\nIt \u2019 s believed that during Perot \u2019 s involvement in the Iran Contra scandal he developed a lasting grudge against George H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third party campaign in 1992 that sabotaged President Bush \u2019 s re-election campaign .\nBetween December of 1985 and January of 1986 the Iran arms for hostages deals would undergo a major shift .\nNorth blamed the Israelis for the fiasco with the IHAWKS , Schwimmer , Nimrodi and Kimche were to be cut out of the deals and replaced with Peres \u2019 counter-terrorism adviser Amiram Nir .\nNorth and Nir had worked closely together on the Achille Lauro Hijacking back in October 1985 .\nNorth \u2019 s plan to intercept the escaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe passage by Egypt in exchange for releasing the hostages nearly provoked an armed clash between US special forces and the Italian Carabinieri on an Italian runway that the US air force had forced their plane to land on .\nNir had been in constant contact with North during the crisis providing Israeli intelligence .\nNow Nir would replace Schwimmer and Nimrodi as the Israeli liaison to the operation .\nThen it was decided to cut the Israeli role as middlemen .\nThe arms deals in 1985 had been illegal under the Arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that a loophole in the economy act would make the deals legal .\nThe new middleman would be Secord \u2019 s enterprise .\nThe Pentagon would sell the weapons to the CIA , the CIA would sell them to Secord , and then Secord would sell them to Iran .\nThis scheme making the Secord \u2019 s Enterprise the middleman had the added bonus of allowing North to divert the profits to the Nicaraguan Contras .\nDuring the HAWKs deal Israel had paid the Enterprise $ 1 million to cover transport .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ after only 18 HAWKs were delivered the Enterprise only spent $ 200,000 renting the CIA plane and other on costs leaving them with $ 800,000 Israel allowed them to keep .\nNorth diverted some of this to the Contras .\nNow with the Defense department selling the TOW missiles for only $ 3,469 each and Ghorbanifar still paying $ 10,000 each the Enterprise would make a hefty profit on each missile .\nThe new plans that January envisioned a series of deals whereby the US would sell Iran 4,000 TOW missiles and Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to diverting money to the Contras North diverted some of the money to Nir \u2019 s scheme to train a 40 man team of Druze in Beirut that would carry out pre-emptive assassinations and perhaps even act as a hostage rescue force .\nOn January 17 1986 President Reagan signed a finding authorizing the scheme to supply arms to Iran via the DOD , CIA , and the Enterprise .\nThe new finding was kept secret from Congress .\nOn February 17 1986 a shipment of 500 TOWs was shipped to Iran on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u201c former \u201d CIA airline that was also being used to smuggle arms to the Contras .\nOn February 27 , 1986 another 500 TOW missiles were delivered .\nNo hostages were freed .\nWith the involvement of the Enterprise the deal had developed a momentum of it \u2019 s own .\nEven if no hostages were freed the Enterprise profited and the resources of North \u2019 s \u201c off the Shelf \u201d Project Democracy were expanded .\nGhorbanifar was now promising direct contacts with the highest levels of the Iranian government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a trip to Iran .\nOriginally the meet was to take place on the Isle of Kish but the location was soon changed to Iran \u2019 s capital Tehran .\nVice President Bush arranged to have the meeting delayed until after his planned visit to Saudi Arabia to avoid being asked awkward questions from an angry ally which hated Iran and was backing Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war .\nAfter a series of meetings in Europe with the Iranians to arrange the details plans were finalized .\nThe US was to arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival all the hostages were to be freed .\nAt least that was what Ghorbanifar told them .\nHe told the Iranians that the Americans were bringing all the HAWK spare parts 15 million worth .\nGhorbanifar had borrowed the money for the deal from Khashoggi .\nOn May 25 , 1986 the McFarlane delegation arrived for the infamous Tehran meetings .\nThey flew in from Israel where they purchased a chocolate cake and they brought along a bunch of revolvers and a small amount of HAWK spare parts .\nThey had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once the hostages were freed .\nThe delegation included McFarlane , North , Secord , Secord \u2019 s partner and Iranian exile Albert Hakim , ex-CIA George Cave , Howard Teicher of the NSC and a CIA radio man .\nCasey had given them cyanide pills in case the Iranians decided to hold them hostage .\nThe meeting was badly timed taking place in the month of Ramadan when muslims fast during the day .\nThe Iranians weren \u2019 t up to negotiating till after their evening meal .\nNo one was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegation .\nGhorbanifar arrived late and the delegation traveled to a hotel .\nFinally some low ranking Iranian officials arrived to negotiate .\nMcFarlane was outraged at the slight .\nThe Iranians were angry that the US hadn \u2019 t brought all the HAWK spare parts .\nThe US realized that the Iranians hadn \u2019 t even begun to bargain to free the hostages .\nThen after Iran contacted Hezbollah , Hezbollah demanded Israel abandon it \u2019 s occupation of Southern Lebanon withdraw from the Golan heights and other just but costly demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negotiations began to improve higher level officials began to arrive , Hezbollah lowered it \u2019 s demands to freeing the Dawa prisoners .\nReagan authorized the shipment of the remaining HAWK spares and Iran was promising to free 2 hostages if they could be given a little more time .\nTo North and Secord \u2019 s disappointment McFarlane and Poindexter convinced Reagan to cancel the deal .\nThey wanted all the hostages freed first and McFarlane was tired of waiting he wanted to leave Tehran .\nThe Iranians begged him to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 hostages in exchange for the HAWK spare parts .\nMcFarlane refused and on May 28 , 1986 the plane carried the delegation back to Israel .\nOn returning to the US to brief the president McFarlane advised Reagan to abandon the arms for hostage deals .\nHowever President Reagan and Oliver North had not given up hope yet .\nNorth would work hard to convince his boss Poindexter to abandon the \u201c All or Nothing \u201d approach and adopt the more realistic \u201c Sequential \u201d release approach .\nThe Iranians were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by freeing all the hostages in advance .\nYet sequential release would ultimately prove futile as in September through October of 1986 Hezbollah would kidnap 3 more Americans Joseph Cicippio , Frank Reed , and Edward Tracy , while the arms for hostage deals would only get 3 hostages released meaning the total number of hostages would end up the same .\nIt would take until 1992 for the final hostages to be freed .\nIn June of 1986 after the failed Tehran meeting the Reagan administration began to plan a hostage rescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pentagon .\nIt proved too difficult to locate the hostages locations .\nNorth received a call from Nir and Ghorbanifar promising to free a hostage on the 4th of July .\nNorth excitedly told the Reagan and Bush .\nExpensive arrangements were made to escort the hostage home .\nThen on the 4th of July nothing happened North was made to look like a fool and refused to speak to Nir for weeks forcing Nir to go through Charles Allen at the CIA who would later be given the task of babysitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1986 Ghorbanifar and Nir finally came through and the hostage Reverend Lawrence Jenco was freed .\nGhorbanifar was desperate to restart the arms for hostages deals .\nHe was millions in debt to Khashoggi because Iran refused to pay him for the HAWK parts that had never been delivered during the Tehran meet .\nGhorbanifar and Khashoggi had become ticking time bombs unless they were paid off they might go public .\nNorth considered paying off Ghorbanifar from the Enterprise \u2019 s coffers or convincing the Iranians to pay him off .\nOn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Israel to meet with Nir who bragged that they were dealing with the most \u201c radical elements \u201d in Iran because they were the ones who could get things done .\nTehran had another disastrous result for Ghorbanifar it had convinced the Americans that they should find a \u201c second Channel \u201d into Iran their term for a 2nd middleman .\nSecord assigned his Iranian partner Albert Hakim to find one .\nThrough his exile contacts Hakim was introduced to Ali Hashemi Bahramani the young nephew of Iran \u2019 s speaker of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the IRGC .\nPoindexter and North were so pleased with Bahramani that they had Secord smuggle him to Washington DC for a meeting at the NSC \u2019 s offices in the Old Executive building .\nThe .\nNorth took Bahramani on a white house tour and arranged CIA approved call girls for him and his party .\nOn October 6-8 North Secord Hakim met with Bahramani and other Iranians in Frankfurt to arrange the next arms deal .\nNorth brought a bible signed by president Reagan .\nNorth had to leave early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of international television after being shot down over Nicaragua .\nThe Iran-Contra scandal was beginning to unravel but the Iran deals continued .\nThe Iranians warned the Americans that 5 million pamphlets describing McFarlane \u2019 s visit had been printed in Tehran .\nAlbert Hakim took over the negotiations agreeing on a 9 point plan with the Iranians to free all the hostages sequentially in exchange for HAWK parts , technical assistance 1500 TOWS , intelligence on Iraq and the freeing of the Dawa prisoners in Kuwait .\nOn October 28 1986 500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 2 , 1986 just in time for the midterm elections hostage David Jacobsen was freed .\nThe next day November 3 , 1986 the Lebanese magazine Ash-Shiraa published an expose on the McFarlane visit to Tehran .\nThe American press picked up the story and the controversy over the Iran Contra scandal exploded .\nReagan went on TV and denied everything .\nThe cover up went into high gear .\nActually back in the fall of 1985 after Congressman Michael Barnes began demanding to see NSC documents on North \u2019 s contra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North \u2019 s plan to start altering NSC files to cover up violations of the Boland amendment .\nThen once Hasenfus was captured Casey had warned North to start shredding documents .\nNow the whole Reagan Administration was desperate to cover up Iran Contra .\nOn November 13 , 1986 Reagan held a disastrous press conference claiming that there had been no arms for hostage deal and that the arms sent could fit on one small plane a blatant lie .\nOn November 19 , 1986 Reagan held another failed press conference where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been involved .\n20 minutes later his aides issued a correction that there had been a 3rd country .\nReagan was especially vulnerable on the Iran issue .\nHis approval rating dropped from 67 % to 46 % during November 1986 .\nReagan had violated the Arms Export Control , sold arms to a country designated a terror sponsor and also conducted covert operations without any presidential finding .\nViolating the Boland amendment carried no legal penalty .\nLongtime Reagan loyalist Attorney General Ed Meese who had served under Reagan since his days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cover up .\nOn November 21 , 1986 Meese launched a formal inquiry into the Iran Contra affair he failed to involve the DOJ Criminal division and failed to take notes at important meetings with Casey , McFarlane , and Poindexter .\nEven as he was being supposedly investigated North was allowed to continue to shred documents .\nWhile North was busy shredding Meese \u2019 s Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds discovered the so called \u201c diversion memo \u201d North had written back in April of 1986 summarizing the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s plans to divert 12 million to the Contras .\nMeese saw it as a perfect opportunity to divert attention from Reagan \u2019 s illegal arms deals in 1985 and onto North the NSC and the diversion .\nNorth had long bragged that he was willing to take the fall for Iran Contra if necessary to protect the President .\nPoindexter had already offered to resign and after interviewing him Meese was certain that he would deny having told Reagan about the diversion .\nReagan \u2019 s Chief of Staff Donald Regan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coverup .\nHe began to leak damaging info on McFarlane to the press .\nOn November 25 , 1986 Reagan announced that Meese had informed him of some shocking news , Meese then took the stage and revealed the diversion to the Press .\nHe announced that Poindexter had resigned but North had been \u201c relieved of his duties \u201d meaning fired .\nNorth found out about it watching it live on TV .\nThen he received a call from President Reagan who told North he was an \u201c American Hero \u201d and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie .\nNorth transferred back to the Marine corps .\nIt would take another article or even a book to do justice to the whole aftermath once the scandal was exposed and this article is long enough already .\nI dealt with the aftermath back in the first part of my Iran Contra series .\nI also discuss it in an interview on Our Hidden History that either has come out or will come out soon depending on when this article is released .\nBefore the scandal had broken the Christic institute had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iran contra conspirators .\nAfter the scandal broke there followed the Tower Commission , the Joint House and Senate Iran Contra hearings and a 6 year long investigation by the Office of the independent council .\nNearly a dozen people were convicted or signed plea deals .\nBush pardoned them all .\nThe one exception was Thomas Clines who was jailed for income tax invasion for failing to report his income from the enterprise .\nDemocracy and rule of law versus the national security state it \u2019 s sort of like Bambi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ) the outcome was never in doubt .\nThere is the way things are \u201c supposed \u201d to work and the way they really work .\nOn the international stage the aftermath of Iran-Contra lead directly to the wars in Panama and Iraq .\nThe Iraq war in various forms continues 30 years later a horrifying bloodbath that has cost millions of lives .\nThanks to the efforts of the NED and a populace exhausted by contra terror and sick of the economic blockade the Sandinistas were voted out of power in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America \u2019 s neoliberal puppets in Nicaragua the Sandinistas were voted back into power and the US is once again intent on overthrowing the Nicaraguan government .\nThere has never been any serious official investigation into the CIA supplying arms cash and advisers to al Qaeda style terrorists

too powerful for the US to invade and occupy .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guerrilla warfare targeting military targets and avoiding civilian targets .\nThey have defeated Israel twice forcing it to withdraw

time they were the most controversial aspect of the scandal .\nIran and its ally Hezbollah had inflicted a series of humiliations on the US that began during the Iranian Revolution and escalated during the war on Lebanon .\nThe Iran Hostage Crisis , the US embassy bombing in Beirut , the kidnapping of CIA Chief of Station William Buckley and most dramatically the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut .\nThe US had branded Iran a state terror sponsor and the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pressure the whole world to stop selling arms to Iran .\nThe US was allied with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf monarchs in backing Iraq in the Iran/Iraq war .\nReagan had publicly called Iran \u201c Murder Incorporated \u201d and claimed the US would never negotiate or make concessions with terrorists .\nYet at the same time as Reagan was publicly condemning Iran the US was supplying them with thousands of anti-tank missiles , helping Iran rebuild its air defences and providing it with intelligence that managed to shift the balance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favour .\nThis was all in an effort to free seven American hostages in Beirut .\nOf course the deeper geopolitical purpose was to prolong the Iran/Iraq war making it as bloody and destructive as possible , a goal the Israeli Mossad veteran David Kimche openly admitted .\nPresident Ronald Reagan overruled objections from his own cabinet to carry the deal out .\nEven when warned that he could face impeachment and prison Reagan pushed for the deals to continue .\nAmong Reagan \u2019 s cabinet only Vice President George H. W. Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continuation of the arms for hostages deals .\nAt a lower level North and Secord , once they were brought in on the deals , also consistently backed the plans as they benefited \u201c The Enterprise.\n\u201d Secord was able to turn a profit while North was able to funnel money to the Contras in Nicaragua .\nThe Iran-Contra investigations failed to investigate the true origins of the Iran arms for hostages deal .\nFirst , Iran under the rule of Shah Pahlavi had been one of the top customers for America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final years of the Shah \u2019 s reign , Richard Secord had headed the Military Assistance program in Iran , helping his arms dealing friends generate vast profits .\nWhen the Iranian revolution overthrew the Shah , the Rockefeller family interests in the form of Chase Manhattan bank were worried the new Iranian government might withdraw the hundreds of millions Iran had deposited in their bank .\nThey had helped to launch the career of President Carter \u2019 s National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski .\nBrzezinski convinced Carter to allow the exiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBack in Iran many thought the US was preparing to launch another coup like the one by which CIA officer Kermit Roosevelt had toppled Mossadegh and restored the Shah back in 1953 .\nIn protest against the US admission of the Shah and in hopes of finding out what the US was plotting , a group of Iranian students seized the embassy .\nThey captured 52 Americans on the embassy staff : State department officials , the CIA , and the military .\nThey also seized all the files documenting decades of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty war on the Iranian people .\nThe Hostage Crisis began on 4 November 1979 .\nPresident Carter retaliated by freezing Iran \u2019 s overseas accounts , allowing Chase-Manhattan to keep Iran \u2019 s money .\nThis at least is one simplified version of events .\nThe Iranian revolution was far more complex than most realize and in fact went through two stages .\nFirst there was the initial overthrow of the Shah by a broader movement that included left wing forces and nationalists .\nSecond came the triumph of Ayatollah Khomeini and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that the rise of Khomeini and the whole hostage crisis were manipulated by western intelligence .\nIran \u2019 s mullahs had long been on the CIA payroll since the days of the 1953 coup .\nIran is by no means a puppet of the US or its allies .\nIran remains one of the few countries willing to stand up to the US and Israel .\nHowever despite the hostile rhetoric from both sides secret deals were made between the US and Iran .\nPresident Jimmy Carter began a year of efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hostages .\nHowever unknown to Carter or his administration he was being targeted for a soft coup by the GOP , disgruntled elements of the CIA , and Big Business in the form of David Rockefeller and his allies .\nIt became known as the \u201c October Surprise \u201d a term for last minute manipulations in October aiming to alter the election results in November .\nThe GOP were obsessed with the idea Carter would free the hostages in October 1980 swinging the election in his favour .\nYet the GOP began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980 .\nThe first secret deals between the GOP and the Khomeini faction took place at least as early as March 1980 .\nReagan \u2019 s campaign manager was OSS veteran Bill Casey .\nCasey set up an October Surprise group to monitor Carter \u2019 s efforts to free the hostages .\nElements within the Carter administration like Donald Gregg at the NSC and Robert Gates at the CIA were leaking information to Casey .\nBush had his own CIA agents for Bush contingent , which included Robert Gambino .\nMany CIA agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October surprise group once Reagan picked Bush as Vice Presidential candidate .\nTo negotiate with Iran Carter \u2019 s administration had picked Cyrus Hashemi .\nCyrus and his brother Jamshid Hashemi had close ties to Mehdi and Hassan Karrubi in Iran .\n( Hassan Karrubi and Cyrus Hashemi would both be deeply involved in the Iran-Contra scandal . )\nThe Hashemi brothers were also close to Admiral Madani who was the main rival of Iran \u2019 s President Bani Sadr .\nUnknown to Carter , Cyrus Hashemi had close ties to Bill Casey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done legal work for them and had known Shaheen for decades .\nCyrus Hashemi became a double agent for the Reagan campaign initially providing them intelligence on Carter \u2019 s negotiations and then acting as a middleman to set up negotiations between Casey and the Iranians .\nCyrus Hashemi \u2019 s First Gulf and Trust bank had been used by the CIA , the Shah \u2019 s family , and the new Iranian government to move money .\nIt had close ties to BCCI , an infamous CIA-backed bank whose clients included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meetings were held .\nIn March 1980 Reagan crony Earl Brian ( who served as Secretary of Health under Governor Reagan ) and Robert \u201c Bud \u201d McFarlane ( who would later set the Iran-Contra arms for hostage deals in motion ) along with Bill Casey met in Madrid with Iranian Mehdi Bazargan ( close to Hashemi \u2019 s contact Mehdi Karrubbi ) to arrange a deal whereby Iran would refuse to release the hostages until after the election in exchange for massive shipments of arms and other concessions .\nThe Israelis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel had begun selling arms to Iran back in September 1979 and would act as middleman in the October Surprise arms deals .\nAfter the Madrid meet Israel supplied Iran with 300 tyres for Iran \u2019 s F4 fighter jets in March 1980 .\nIranian born Israeli Ari Ben Menashe would play a major role in the arms deals and in later exposing the October Surprise .\nIn return the Reagan Administration would turn a blind eye as Israel sold nearly a billion dollars in arms to Iran in the early 1980s .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shackley , would later meet with the Iranians in London and Hamburg .\nHe was Bush \u2019 s point man on October Surprise .\nA Bush memo was uncovered revealing that Bush later told Richard Allen ( who would go on to be Reagan \u2019 s first National Security Adviser ) to contact Shackley with any last minute details on Carter \u2019 s hostage negotiations .\nShackley was also close to Michael Ledeen who was involved in the October surprise and the \u201c BillyGate \u201d scandal targeting Carter \u2019 s brother .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of secret meetings with Iranian representatives including Mehdi Karrubi in Madrid .\nAfter meeting with Khomeini , Karrubi requested another meeting with Casey , held in August 1980 .\nMeanwhile the Carter administration was working from a hard bargaining stance completely unaware that the Iranians had already gotten a better offer from the GOP .\nOn 24 April 1980 , the US mounted a disastrous rescue attempt \u201c Operation Eagle Claw \u201d .\nEither through bad luck , incompetence , or sabotage it ended in complete disaster when two of the helicopters crashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desert One .\nEight men from the US military died in the crash .\nThe others were forced to flee since they no longer had enough helicopters to carry out the rescue .\nThe corpses of the dead Americans were paraded through Teheran , enraging the US public and humiliating Carter .\nRichard Secord , Robert Dutton , and Richard Gadd future members of \u201c The Enterprise \u201d were all involved in the hostage rescue plans .\nThe failure would lead to a massive re-expansion of the Special Forces that began under Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own time .\nIn September 1980 Carter \u2019 s luck was finally poised to change .\nIran \u2019 s President Bani Sadr had learned of the GOP \u2019 s secret deal with Khomeini and planned to go public on 8 September 1980 .\nTo keep him quiet Khomeini agreed to reopen negotiations with the US .\nIran was also worried about an increasingly hostile Iraq .\nKhomeini sent Sadegh Tatabani to make a deal and Carter \u2019 s negotiators seized on the opportunity .\nYet once again Brzezinski \u2019 s machinations would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hussein \u2019 s Iraq to invade Iran .\nThe war began on 22 September 1980 .\nThus Tatabani was unable to return to Iran because Iraq was bombing the Teheran airport .\nIn late September or early October the Iranians would meet with GOP representatives at the L \u2019 Enfant Plaza Hotel in Washington DC where Israeli Housang Lavi , Americans Richard Allen , Robert McFarlane , and Lawrence Silberman met with Iranian representatives .\n( President Reagan would later appoint Silberman a judge and Judge Silberman would overturn North and Poindexter \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting was followed by a meeting at the Ritz Hotel in Paris from 17 \u2013 18 October 1980 , attended by Bill Casey and Vice Presidential Candidate George H. W. Bush along with Robert McFarlane , Robert Gates , Donald Gregg and George Cave .\nThe Iranians agreed to hold the hostages until after the inauguration .\nIt was bad enough the GOP was convincing the Iranians to hold onto the hostages until after the election .\nNow it wanted Iran to hold onto them even longer so that Reagan could come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To cement the deal a French Israeli arms shipment was sent to Iran on 23 October 1980 , consisting of 250 F4 spare tyres and M6 tank spare parts .\nOn 4 November 1980 , the US general election was held .\nOn the first anniversary of the start of the hostage crisis Carter lost to Reagan .\nOn 20 January 1981 , Reagan was inaugurated President and the hostages were released .\nThe US was soon supplying Iran with arms worth hundreds of millions of dollars through Israel , South Korea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of the \u201c October Surprise \u201d secret to get away with selling Iran nearly a billion dollars in arms in 1981-1983 .\nNaive Americans believed the strange coincidence of the hostages being released on the day of the inauguration was because of Reagan \u2019 s tough stance on terrorism .\nBy massively expanding Carter \u2019 s war in Afghanistan , Reagan and Casey would play a major role in giving birth to Al Qaeda .\nThe Reagan years would also see the origins of the same rhetoric and tactics of the later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not personally take part in the October Surprise negotiations , he was almost certainly informed of the secret .\nIt is the only way to explain his obsession with pursuing the Iran-Contra arms for hostages deals despite their quickly evolving into a farce filled with lies and broken promises .\nCongress and most of the media would cover up the October Surprise .\nThe October Surprise story has been confirmed by dozens of witnesses from around the world including former President Bani Sadr , Ari Ben Menashe , Ariel Sharon , Yasser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of French Intelligence and close Bush ally ) Russian Intelligence , and the Iranian Government offered to send proof to Bill Clinton .\nIn the years that followed the bloody Iran-Iraq war would continue , eventually claiming over a million lives .\nThe US was busy supplying Iraq with arms via Egypt .\nMeanwhile the CIA provided the Iraqis intelligence to plan their attacks .\nIn 1982 Israel invaded Lebanon and installed a puppet government .\nThe Israelis had sparked the Lebanese civil war back in 1975 encouraging their fascist Christian Phalange allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country .\nSouthern Lebanon was being used as a base for Palestinian forces to shell Israel .\nThe Israelis were even more annoyed with them when the Palestinians maintained a ceasefire .\nIn 1978 Israel had invaded and occupied Southern Lebanon but Carter had forced them to withdraw .\nNow with Reagan in office in 1982 Israel invaded Lebanon eventually creating a puppet state in Southern Lebanon .\nSouthern Lebanon was also home to a huge Shiite population and with the aid of Iran \u2019 s IRGC they formed Hezbollah in 1982 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ siding with the Israelis and the Phalange while pretending to be neutral peacekeepers .\nIt would take Hezbollah nearly 20 years to force Israel to withdraw from Lebanon .\nHezbollah would force the US to withdraw in just one year .\nOn 18 April 1983 , Hezbollah detonated a van packed with explosives outside the US embassy , killing 63 people .\nA dozen high level CIA personnel , including their top Mid-East analyst , Robert Ames , whom Casey had sent to Beirut .\nRobert McFarlane was sent as a special emissary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involvement in the war , shelling and bombing Lebanese civilians .\nThen on 23 October 1983 , a huge truck bomb tore into the Marine Barracks in Beirut .\n241 US military personnel were killed .\nThe US claimed it would not pull out but quietly did .\nThe American public was distracted from this withdrawal by US regime \u2019 s Invasion of Grenada , where it had already deposed the country \u2019 s leader , Maurice Bishop .\nOliver North helped plan that invasion .\nOn 7 March 1984 , CNN journalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 March 1984 , Hezbollah kidnapped the CIA station chief , William Buckley , on his way to work .\nHe was later sent to Iran for questioning under torture .\nHis capture and worry over what he might reveal was a major factor in motivating the US to trade arms for hostages .\nBuckley would tell all to the Iranians and they transcribed his confession into a 400-page book .\nBuckley would die before he could be freed .\nSix more American hostages would be kidnapped by Hezbollah or its front groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 June 1985 .\nThey were Reverend Benjamin Weir , Peter Kilburn ( librarian at American University ) Father Lawrence Martin Jenco ( Catholic relief services ) , Terry Anderson ( AP journalist ) David Jacobsen ( Hospital Director at American University ) and finally Thomas Southerland ( Director of Agriculture at American University ) They were kidnapped to gain leverage to free the Dawa prisoners being held in Kuwait after a series of attacks on American and French targets there .\nTheir kidnappings would provide the motivations or the excuse for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostage deals .\nOnly Jeremy Levin would seemingly escape after being ransomed .\nA key factor behind the Iran-Contra scandal that few delved into was a web of groups set up by Vice President George H.W .\nBush that dealt with crisis management and counter-terrorism .\nIt was thanks to the key role that North played in the counter-terror network or as Peter Dales Scott calls it \u201c a Cabal \u201d that North became not just the point man for the Contras but also in charge of counter-terrorism and eventually in charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The \u201c Cabal \u201d included Admiral John Poindexter ( NSC ) , Oliver North ( NSC ) , Duane \u201c Dewey \u201d Clarridge ( CIA ) Charles Allen ( CIA ) , Robert Oakley ( State Department ) , Noel Koch ( DOD ) Lt Gen John Moellering ( Joint Chiefs of Staff ) and Oliver \u201c Buck \u201d Revell ( FBI ) .\nThey communicated via \u201c Flashboard \u201d a secret email system .\nNSDD ( National Security Directive ) 3 had put Vice President Bush in charge of crisis management back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his secretary Fawn Hall to work on crisis management .\nThis lead to North drawing up Continuity of Government plans calling for declaring martial law , suspending the constitution , total surveillance , and rounding up tens of thousands of dissidents and hundreds of thousands of refugees in the event of nuclear war , terror attacks , or even civil unrest .\nDonald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney would also be involved in these plans during the Clinton administration .\nThey formed the blueprint for America \u2019 s post 9/11 response .\nBush also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Special Situations Group .\nNorth worked on the creation of a Crisis Management Center .\nIn April 1984 North Drafted an NSDD that created the TIWG ( Terrorist Incident Working Group ) .\nTwo TIWG members would work closely with North , Craig Coy and Robert Earl .\nIn July 1985 , President Reagan convened the Vice President \u2019 s Task Force on Combatting Terrorism .\nAt the exact same time , the US suddenly reversed its Iran strategy , opening the door for the Iran arms for hostage deals Peter Dale Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as the US was preparing to make direct arms sales to Iran , NSDD 207 put North in charge of counter-terrorism and set up a secret Office to Combat Terrorism run by Oliver North and staffed by veterans of Bush \u2019 s counter-terror cabal .\nMichael Ledeen and the Israeli Amiram Nir were also part of this counter-terror network and like North would play major roles in the Iran-Contra scandal , along with Robert Oakley and Dewey Clarridge .\nThrough the counter-terror network Bush and North became close .\nThanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became as deeply embroiled in the Iran side of the scandal as he had been in the Contra side .\nIt was sort of the government equivalent of setting up a bunch of shell companies .\nThe bloodiest incident in North \u2019 s war on terror was the attempt to assassinate a Hezbollah leader Muhammed Hussein Fadallah with a car bomb .\n80 people were killed in the attack , but Fadallah survived .\nNow it is time to introduce North \u2019 s bosses at the NSC , Robert \u201c Bud \u201d McFarlane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McFarlane was the son of a Democratic congressman in Texas .\nHe graduated from the US Naval Academy in 1959 and was commissioned into the Marine Corps .\nMcFarlane lead the first US combat unit in Vietnam .\nHe studied in Switzerland and received a White House Fellowship .\nAlexander Haig , an Army general and Henry Kissinger \u2019 s deputy at the NSC , brought in McFarlane as his military assistant .\nMcFarlane came to regard Kissinger as his mentor .\nMcFarlane had even participated in Kissinger \u2019 s secret China negotiations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iran initiative would earn him a similar place in history .\nHe retired from the Marine Corps as a lieutenant colonel and served two years on the Senate Armed Services Committee under Senator John Tower .\nTower was also involved in the October Surprise and was picked by Reagan to investigate/ cover-up the scandals .\nOnce Reagan was President he picked Alexander Haig as his Secretary of State .\nHaig brought McFarlane on as a counsellor to the State Department .\nThen , with Haig on the way out as Secretary of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Security Adviser William Clark \u2019 s deputy .\nWhen Clark stepped down as National Security Adviser the Edwin Meese , Michael Deaver , and James Baker faction , called the \u201c Troika \u201d , which dominated the early Reagan Administration tried to appoint James Baker as the new National Security Adviser .\nBaker was a close friend of George H.W .\nBush who became infamous as the Bush family \u201c Fixer.\n\u201d William Casey blocked the appointment and McFarlane was chosen as the National Security Adviser as a compromise .\nSince \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Marine lieutenant colonels serving on the NSC and both workaholics they developed a sort of father-son relationship .\nMcFarlane came to rely ever more on North .\nMcFarlane was also a long-time friend of Mossad veteran and director of the Israeli Foreign Ministry David Kimche .\nMcFarlane put great trust in Casey \u2019 s advice .\nMcFarlane \u2019 s trust in both Casey and Kimche would lead him to plunge into the disastrous Iranian arms for hostage deals .\nVice Admiral John Poindexter was McFarlane \u2019 s deputy at NSC and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early December 1985 .\nHe was born in a small farming town in Indiana .\nHe graduated top of his academy class at Annapolis then received a PhD in nuclear physics from the California Institute of Technology .\nHe served under three Secretaries of the Navy and as executive assistant to the Chief of Naval Operations Admiral James Holloway .\nHe also commanded a guided missile cruiser and a destroyer squadron .\nPoindexter was recruited to set up the computer network for Bush \u2019 s Crisis Management Center .\nHe had IBM install @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NSC allowing North and the other Iran-Contra conspirators to email each other via PROF messages .\nThe NSC crisis management network linked the NSC computer network to the computer networks of the State Department , the CIA , the Pentagon , numerous law enforcement agencies , military bases around the world and foreign intelligence services .\nThis was a few years before anyone in the general public knew what an email was .\nThis would come back to haunt Poindexter , North and others when they deleted all their PROF messages only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Tower Committee figure out how to recover them all .\nOn the Internet nothing is ever really deleted .\nPoindexter was secretive and a bit more reckless then McFarlane .\nAt the height of the Iran-Contra scandal Poindexter would save Reagan by testifying to Congress ( almost certainly falsely ) that Reagan had not been informed of the diversion of funds from the Iran arms sales to the Contras .\nAdnan Khashoggi , the Saudi Billionaire who the press dubbed \u201c the world \u2019 s wealthiest man \u201d , had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bribes to Middle Eastern officials to buy American weapons systems .\nHe was famous for his yachts , lavish parties and high-class call girl ring .\nOne of Khashoggi \u2019 s call girls would bring down presidential hopeful Senator Gary Hart .\nKhashoggi was close friends with Donald Trump and sold him a yacht .\nAdnan was the uncle of Jamal Khashoggi whose murder in the Saudi embassy in Ankara , on orders of King Muhammed bin Salman , made news back in 2018 .\nBetween 1983 and 1984 Khashoggi met frequently with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell him on various schemes .\nIn late 1984 Khashoggi would team up with Manucher Ghorbanifar on a scheme to sell arms to Iran in order to free the hostages .\nIran was desperate for weapons .\nThe Iraqi \u2019 s Soviet-supplied tanks were smashing them on the battlefield .\nIraq was bombing Iran and Iran was running out of missiles and parts for its air defence system .\nIt would later emerge during the Iraqgate investigations that Vice President Bush had provided intelligence and encouragement for Iraq to bomb Iran to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme , but this was probably later .\nManucher Ghorbanifar , the middleman in the Iran arms deals , was an arms dealer who had served in Savak , become an Israeli agent , and supplied information to the CIA .\nThat information was deemed so unreliable that the agency had issued a burn notice on him as a known fabricator after he failed too many lie detector tests .\nThe Iranians were desperate enough for weapons that they were willing to use a known Israeli agent like Ghorbanifar .\nGhorbanifar would become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Iranians to get them to the bargaining table .\nGhorbanifar \u2019 s Iranian contacts , Hassan Karrubi and Mohsen Kangarlou , had been involved in the earlier October Surprise negotiations .\nGhorbanifar hoped to make millions of dollars off the arms deals .\nOliver North was as big of a liar as Ghorbanifar practicing that special American brand of bullshitting necessary to the salesman or the sports coach .\nDesperate to gain the confidence of the Americans after the CIA had discarded him , Ghorbanifar met with Theodore Shackley in Hamburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned ( falsely ) that Iran was in danger of becoming a Soviet satellite within 5 years .\nGhorbanifar wanted to buy TOW anti-tank missiles and offered to free the kidnapped CIA station chief William Buckley and provide captured Soviet equipment to the US .\nTed Shackley was running a risk management firm , Research Associates Inc. , and was closely monitoring the Iran-Iraq war .\nShackley had hired an Iranian named Razmara who introduced Shackley to the former head of the Savak \u2019 s counter-intelligence , General Manucher Hashemi , in October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting with Ghorbanifar .\nAccording to veteran CIA Iran operative George Cave , Shackley was working for the NSC .\nShackley was also working for Vice President George H.W .\nBush while ostensibly in the private intelligence business .\nShackley was close to both Secord and Clines , his \u201c former \u201d business partners .\nShackley drafted a memo on 22 November 1984 and sent it to Vernon Walters Reagan \u2019 s ambassador at large and fellow CIA veteran\u2014 also infamous for his role in the 1964 Brazil coup .\nWalters forwarded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department \u2019 s point man on counter-terrorism ( Part of the Bush/North Counter terror network ) and to Assistant Secretary of State for the Near East Richard W. Murphy .\nBecause of Ghorbanifar \u2019 s dubious reputation the offer was initially rejected .\nBy March 1988 Shackley \u2019 s memo landed on the desk of NSC consultant Michael Ledeen who claimed ( probably falsely ) that he never read it , but forwarded it to Oliver North .\nLedeen was another of Shackley \u2019 s friends from the October Surprise days .\nMichael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hostages deal .\nLedeen was a CIA press asset and a contractor for Italy \u2019 s SISMI intelligence agency along with Shackley .\nIn Italy , Ledeen would help cover up GLADIO and spread the myth of the Soviet Union being behind all the world \u2019 s terror attacks .\nLedeen had close ties to Israeli intelligence , was a far right neo-con , and had earlier befriended Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres , when Ledeen was sent to infiltrate the Socialist International , of which Peres \u2019 Labour Party was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on counter terrorism at the NSC .\nLedeen got McFarlane \u2019 s permission to travel to Israel to explore using Israel \u2019 s contacts to gain intelligence on Iran .\nOnce in Israel the Israelis introduced Ledeen to the Iranian Manucher Ghorbanifar , the Saudi Adnan Khashoggi , along with two Israeli arms dealers , Adolph Schwimmer and Yaacov Nimrodi .\nThey had a pile of disinformation to sell Ledeen along with the promise to free the seven American hostages .\nThe disinformation was that Iran was in danger of falling into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contact with a pro-Western faction that hoped to take power once Khomeini was dead .\nSupposedly Iran was divided into three factions : a pro-Soviet faction , a neutral faction , and a pro-Western faction .\nGhorbanifar promised to put the US in contact with the \u201c moderates.\n\u201d In reality Iranian politics in the Islamic republic had nothing to do with such simple Cold War dynamics .\nThere were no pro-Soviet factions and no pro-American factions .\nBack in 1983 a Soviet defector had supplied the CIA with a complete list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send the list to Iran .\nKhomeini had them killed or arrested .\nHowever , like most countries , Iran was ruled by ruthless pragmatists , who were willing to buy arms from Israel or the US because of the Iran-Iraq war .\nArms procurement was controlled by Iran \u2019 s IRGC , the Revolutionary Guard .\nHowever they were used to operating through Iranian exiles and shady characters like Ghorbanifar .\nWhile in Israel Ledeen also met with Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres and David Kimche , the director general of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nKimche would go on to advise the greatest mass murderer of recent times Rwanda \u2019 s President Paul Kagame in the 1990s .\nKimche would fly to Washington DC to meet with McFarlane a couple weeks after Ledeen \u2019 s return .\nWhen Ledeen met with the Israeli prime minister , Peres vouched for Ghorbanifar , Khashoggi , Schwimmer , and Nimrodi and asked Ledeen to deliver a personal message to \u201c Bud McFarlane.\n\u201d Schwimmer was a major backer of Peres and the Iran deal was meant to reward him .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lucrative arms market by the Likud party , the Mossad , and the Israeli defence department and Peres hoped that with US backing his cronies could get into the Iran arms sales business .\nReturning to the US , Ledeen briefed McFarlane on the arms for hostages deal and passed on Peres \u2019 message .\nMcFarlane bought the cover story on Iranian moderates and hoped that by bringing Iran back into the US orbit he would earn his place in the history books alongside his mentor Kissinger .\nCIA director Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept the CIA \u2019 s top Iranian analysts reports from reaching the NSC lest they discredit the cover story about selling arms to Iranian moderates .\nInstead Casey had Graham Fuller ( later infamous for his role backing al Qaeda style groups in Central Asia ) write a report calling for a complete reversal on US policy towards Iran .\nSoon the NSC had a draft finding on a new Iran policy that would enable the Iran arms for hostages deals to go forward .\nNow it was a decision for the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Group , a modified NSC ) .\nThe idea was strongly opposed by both Secretary of State George Schultz and Secretary of Defence Caspar Weinberger .\nCasey , McFarlane , and Vice President Bush supported the arms for hostages scheme .\nThe idea got a boost in June 1985 .\nThen Iran and Syria helped negotiate the release of the TWA 847 hostages being held in Beirut after their plane had been hijacked by a Hezbollah front Islamic Jihad .\nIsrael freed hundreds of Shiite prisoners it was holding in exchange .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parliament Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani who was also a key player behind the scenes on the arms for hostages deals .\nThe decisive voice belonged to President Ronald Reagan and he was in favour of going ahead .\nPresident Reagan gave the final green light to McFarlane on 13 July 1985 , while in the hospital recovering from a polyp operation .\nManucher Ghorbanifar had promised to free all of the hostages once 100 TOW anti-tank missiles were delivered .\nIsrael was to act as the middleman .\nIt would ship TOWS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised it would send replacements .\nTo finance the deal Ghorbanifar borrowed USD 1 million from Khashoggi .\nYaacov Nimrodi and Al Schwimmer charged Ghorbainfar USD 10,000 for each missile .\nThe Israeli Defence Ministry sold them to the two Israeli arms dealers for only USD 6,000 each .\nGhorbanifar charged Iran USD 12,000 for each TOW .\nOn 20 August 1985 Israel delivered 96 TOW missiles to Iran , choosing the defective or obsolete TOWs from their own stockpile .\n( Apparently TOWs are shipped in 8 packs ) On landing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNo hostages were released .\nGhorbanifar used the excuse that since the IRGC not the \u201c moderates \u201d had gotten the missiles the moderates had not freed any hostages .\nHowever Ghorbanifar had a new deal for 400 more TOW missiles plus the four TOWs Israel still owed them from the first shipment .\nIran would get a hostage freed .\nAmazingly the arrogant US agreed to this second deal after Ghorbanifar had failed to deliver the first time .\nOn 15 September 1985 , Israel delivered 408 TOWs to Iran .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ was released .\nThe US had hoped to free CIA station chief William Buckley first ; Casey had even played Reagan a video of Buckley being tortured .\nThe Iranians claimed Buckley was too ill to travel .\nIn reality he had died in June 1985 .\nIran now hoped to rebuild its air defences with the next deal .\nThe Iranians were now demanding HAWK surface to air missiles and Phoenix missiles .\nThe US refused to sell the Phoenix missiles , which it did not even supply to most of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAWKs however .\nThe deal was for 120 IHAWK missiles Iran would pay USD 18 million or USD 225,000 each .\nIHAWKS were the more advanced version .\nThe plan was for Israel to ship them to Iran via Portugal .\nThis is when Oliver North was recruited to run the Iran arms for hostages deals .\nAt first McFarlane had put North in charge of replenishing Israeli stocks .\nMcFarlane was busy preparing for the arms control summit in Geneva .\nHowever Portugal was refusing permission to allow the missiles shipment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOn 17 November 1985 , Israeli defence minister Yitzhak Rabin called North to fix the problem and McFarlane called soon after to confirm that he had referred Rabin to North .\nNorth brought in Secord whose partner Tom Clines had close contacts with the Portuguese arms company DEFEX .\nHowever DEFEX had strong ties to the party that had recently been voted out of office instead of the new government .\nThe HAWK deal quickly turned into a fiasco .\nSecord \u2019 s attempt to hold an unscheduled meeting with the foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe US embassy was ignorant of the deal and told Portugal not to approve it .\nNorth brought in Duane \u201c Dewey \u201d Clarridge serving as the CIA \u2019 s head of European operations to get the CIA \u2019 s help in pressuring Portugal .\n( It has been suggested that the officially unexplained death of Portugal \u2019 s prime minister Francisco de Sa Carneiro in an airplane crash on 4 December 1980 was not unrelated to such attempts to use Portugal for intermediary purposes . )\nAl Schwimmer lost patience and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearance hoping the problem would be solved before it landed .\nThe plane was forced to turn around and its lease ran out .\nThe Israelis agreed to pay Secord \u2019 s \u201c Enterprise \u201d USD 1 million for transport .\nDewey Clarridge called Langley to get the name of a CIA-controlled airline in St. Lucia .\nThis would raise all sorts of legal problems once the scandal broke .\nTo engage in a covert operation the CIA needed a Presidential finding .\nIn any case , the St. Lucia plane was smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could carry fewer missiles .\nSecord arranged for the flight to be rerouted through Cyprus and then over Turkey to Iran .\nCyprus gave no official permission but someone probably paid off the right people as no one interfered .\nOn 25 November 1985 , 18 HAWK missiles arrived in Iran .\nThe Iranians were furious that these were not the IHAWKS they had been promised but the less advanced HAWKS .\nNor had Israel bothered to scrape off the \u201c David \u201d stars on them .\nGhorbanifar called North in a panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostages lives were in danger .\nBack at the CIA Casey \u2019 s more cautious deputy director John McMahon demanded that a \u201c retroactive \u201d presidential finding be created to cover for the CIA .\nA retroactive finding was created and signed by President Reagan on 5 December 1985 and then thrown into an NSC safe .\nThe whole point of a finding was to inform Congress .\nThere was not supposed to be any such thing as a retroactive finding .\nOn 4 December 1985 , President Reagan had announced that McFarlane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be replaced by Admiral John Poindexter .\nMcFarlane was getting increasingly frustrated with the Iran arms deals .\nHe wanted all the hostages freed before any more weapons were sent .\nHe was also beginning to realize that he had been duped about the possibility of installing a \u201c moderate \u201d government in Iran .\nAfter the scandal broke in November 1986 , Poindexter would burn the retroactive finding because it was clear evidence of arms for hostages deals .\nNorth had another scheme to free the hostages alongside the Iran arms for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dweyer and Frank Tarallo had come to North with a scheme to use an informant they had in Beirut , a major drug trafficker , to act as middleman in arranging to ransom the hostages .\nNorth turned to Texas Billionaire H. Ross Perot to provide the ransom .\nPerot made his money in electronics and so had tight ties with the intelligence community .\nDuring the Iran hostage crisis he had managed to free four of his employees .\nThere were a couple attempts to ransom a hostage in Beirut ending in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informant claimed he had spent $ 300,000 in bribes and was suspected of pocketing some of the money .\nAnother time North planned to treat the ransom with a chemical that would cause the money to disintegrate days later , a scheme which would have damaged all future hostage negotiations .\nFinally the deal fell through when the informant demanded a million dollars up front .\nThe DEA men refused .\nPerot was very angry over the failure but was consoled with a personal letter from Reagan thanking him for his efforts .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ s involvement in the Iran-Contra scandal he developed a lasting grudge against George H. W. Bush .\nThis is supposed to have inspired Perot to launch the third party campaign in 1992 that sabotaged President Bush \u2019 s re-election campaign .\nBetween December 1985 and January 1986 , the Iran arms for hostages deals would undergo a major shift .\nNorth blamed the Israelis for the fiasco with the IHAWKS , Schwimmer , Nimrodi and Kimche were to be cut out of the deals and replaced with Peres \u2019 counter-terrorism adviser Amiram Nir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together on the Achille Lauro hijacking back in October 1985 .\nNorth \u2019 s plan to intercept the escaping Achille Lauro hijackers who had been offered safe passage by Egypt in exchange for releasing the hostages nearly provoked an armed clash between US Special Forces operatives and the Italian Carabinieri on an Italian runway where the US Air Force had been forced to land their plane .\nNir had been in constant contact with North during the crisis , providing Israeli intelligence .\nNow Nir would replace Schwimmer and Nimrodi as the Israeli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was decided to cut the Israeli role as middlemen .\nThe arms deals in 1985 had been illegal under the Arms Export Control Act .\nThe Reagan Administration believed that a loophole in the Economy Act would make the deals legal .\nThe new middleman would be Secord \u2019 s Enterprise .\nThe Pentagon would sell the weapons to the CIA , the CIA would sell them to Secord , and then Secord would sell them to Iran .\nThis scheme making the Secord \u2019 s Enterprise the middleman had the added bonus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Nicaraguan Contras .\nDuring the HAWKs deal , Israel had paid the Enterprise USD 1 million to cover transport .\nBut since the deal had been aborted after only 18 HAWKs were delivered the Enterprise only spent USD 200,000 renting the CIA plane and other on costs leaving them with USD 800,000 , which Israel allowed them to keep .\nNorth diverted some of this to the Contras .\nNow with the Defence department selling the TOW missiles for only $ 3,469 each and Ghorbanifar still paying $ 10,000 each , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on each missile .\nThe new plans that January envisioned a series of deals whereby the US would sell Iran 4,000 TOW missiles and Iran would free 4 hostages .\nIn addition to diverting money to the Contras , North diverted some of the money to Nir \u2019 s scheme to train a 40-man team of Druze in Beirut that would carry out pre-emptive assassinations and perhaps even act as a hostage rescue force .\nOn 17 January 1986 , President Reagan signed a finding authorizing the scheme to supply arms to Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Enterprise .\nThe new finding was kept secret from Congress .\nOn 17 February 1986 , 500 TOWs was shipped to Iran on Enterprise planes rented from Southern Air Transport , the \u201c former \u201d CIA airline that was also being used to smuggle arms to the Contras .\nOn 27 February 1986 , another 500 TOW missiles were delivered .\nNo hostages were freed .\nWith the involvement of the Enterprise the deal had developed a momentum of it \u2019 s own .\nEven if no hostages were freed the Enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s \u201c off the shelf \u201d Project Democracy were expanded .\nGhorbanifar was now promising direct contacts with the highest levels of the Iranian government .\nMcFarlane would act as special envoy on a trip to Iran .\nOriginally the meeting was to take place on the Isle of Kish but the location was soon changed to Iran \u2019 s capital Teheran .\nVice President Bush arranged to have the meeting delayed until after his planned visit to Saudi Arabia to avoid being asked awkward questions from an angry ally who hated Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war .\nAfter a series of meetings with the Iranians in Europe to arrange the details , plans were finalized .\nThe US was to arrive bringing HAWK spare parts and upon their arrival all the hostages were to be freed .\nAt least that was what Ghorbanifar told them .\nHe told the Iranians that the Americans were bringing all the HAWK spare parts , USD 15 million worth .\nGhorbanifar had borrowed the money for the deal from Khashoggi .\nOn 25 May 1986 , the McFarlane delegation arrived for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Israel where they purchased a chocolate cake .\nThey brought along a bunch of revolvers and a small amount of HAWK spare parts .\nThey had left the rest in Israel to be delivered once the hostages were freed .\nThe delegation included McFarlane , North , Secord , Secord \u2019 s partner and Iranian exile Albert Hakim , ex-CIA George Cave , Howard Teicher of the NSC and a CIA radioman .\nCasey had given them cyanide pills in case the Iranians decided to hold them hostage .\nThe meeting was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month of Ramadan when Muslims fast during the day .\nThe Iranians were not ready to negotiate until after their evening meal .\nNo one was there at the airport to meet the McFarlane delegation .\nGhorbanifar arrived late and the delegation travelled to a hotel .\nFinally some low ranking Iranian officials arrived to negotiate .\nMcFarlane was outraged at the slight .\nThe Iranians were angry that the US hadn \u2019 t brought all the HAWK spare parts .\nThe US realized that the Iranians had not even begun to bargain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iran contacted Hezbollah , Hezbollah demanded Israel abandon its occupation of Southern Lebanon , withdraw from the Golan heights and other just but costly demands .\nGradually over the next couple of days the negotiations began to improve .\nHigher-level officials began to arrive .\nHezbollah lowered its demands to freeing the Dawa prisoners .\nReagan authorized the shipment of the remaining HAWK spares .\nIran promised to free 2 hostages if they could be given a little more time .\nTo North \u2019 s and Secord \u2019 s disappointment McFarlane and Poindexter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They wanted all the hostages freed first and McFarlane was tired of waiting .\nHe wanted to leave Tehran .\nThe Iranians begged him to stay for 6 more hours , offering to free 2 hostages in exchange for the HAWK spare parts .\nMcFarlane refused and on 28 May 1986 , the plane carried the delegation back to Israel .\nOn returning to the US to brief the president McFarlane advised Reagan to abandon the arms for hostages deals .\nHowever President Reagan and Oliver North had not given up hope yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boss Poindexter to abandon the \u201c all or nothing \u201d approach and adopt the more realistic \u201c sequential \u201d release approach .\nThe Iranians were not about to give up all their leverage by freeing all the hostages in advance .\nYet sequential release would ultimately prove futile .\nFrom September through October 1986 Hezbollah would kidnap three more Americans : Joseph Cicippio , Frank Reed , and Edward Tracy , while the arms for hostage deals would only get 3 hostages released .\nThat meant the total number of hostages would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take until 1992 for the last hostages to be freed .\nIn June 1986 after the failed Teheran meeting , the Reagan administration began to plan a hostage rescue mission using Secord , the CIA and the Pentagon .\nIt proved too difficult to locate the hostages \u2019 locations .\nNorth received a call from Nir and Ghorbanifar promising to free a hostage on the 4th of July .\nNorth excitedly told the Reagan and Bush .\nExpensive arrangements were made to escort the hostage home .\nThen on the 4th of July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like a fool and refused to speak to Nir for weeks , forcing Nir to go through Charles Allen at the CIA Allen would later be given the task of babysitting Ghorbanifar .\nOn 25 July 1986 , Ghorbanifar and Nir finally came through .\nThe hostage Reverend Lawrence Jenco was freed .\nGhorbanifar was desperate to restart the arms for hostages deals .\nHe was

with Nir , who bragged that they were dealing with the most \u201c radical elements \u201d in Iran because they were the ones who could get things done .\nTeheran had another disastrous result for

the Lebanese magazine Ash-Shiraa published an expose on the McFarlane visit to Teheran .\nThe American press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the Iran-Contra scandal exploded .\nReagan went on TV and denied

had OK \u2019 d North \u2019 s plan to start altering NSC files to cover up violations of the Boland amendment .\nThen once Hasenfus was captured Casey had warned North to start shredding documents .\nNow the whole Reagan Administration was desperate to cover up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Reagan held a disastrous press conference claiming that there had been no arms for hostages deal and that the arms sent could fit on one small plane\u2014a blatant lie .\nOn 19 November 1986 , Reagan held another failed press conference where he claimed that no third country had been involved .\nTwenty minutes later his aides issued a correction that there had been a third country .\nReagan was especially vulnerable on the Iran issue .\nHis approval rating dropped from 67 % to 46 % during November 1986 .\nReagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sold arms to a country designated a terror sponsor and also conducted covert operations without any presidential finding .\nHowever , violating the Boland amendment carried no legal penalty .\nLong-time Reagan loyalist , Attorney General Edwin Meese , who had served under Reagan since his days as Governor of California , took charge of the cover up .\nOn 21 November 1986 , Meese launched a formal inquiry into the Iran-Contra affair .\nHe failed to involve the DOJ Criminal division and failed to take notes at important meetings with Casey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he was being supposedly investigated North was allowed to continue to shred documents .\nWhile North was busy shredding Meese \u2019 s Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds discovered the so-called \u201c diversion memo \u201d North had written back in April 1986 , summarizing the history of the Iran arms deal and containing North \u2019 s plans to divert USD 12 million to the Contras .\nMeese saw it as a perfect opportunity to divert attention from Reagan \u2019 s illegal arms deals in 1985 and onto North , the NSC and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was willing to take the fall for Iran-Contra if necessary to protect the President .\nPoindexter had already offered to resign and after interviewing him Meese was certain that he would deny having told Reagan about the diversion .\nReagan \u2019 s chief of staff Donald Regan was Meese \u2019 s partner in the cover-up .\nHe began to leak damaging info on McFarlane to the press .\nOn 25 November 1986 , Reagan announced that Meese had informed him of some shocking news .\nMeese then took the stage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He announced that Poindexter had resigned but North had been \u201c relieved of his duties \u201d meaning fired .\nNorth found out

P. Wilkinson The Iran/Contra scandal is so complex that I \u2019 ve decided to separate the Nicaragua and Iran parts into separate articles .\nMany of the cast of characters introduced in this article will reappear in the next .\nNames like National Security Advisers Robert McFarlane and John Poindexter , Oliver North , Richard Secord , Albert Hakim , Thomas Clines , and Duane \u201c Dewey \u201d Clarridge .\nIsrael would play an important role in both Central America and the Middle East .\nAnd of course President Ronald Reagan , Vice President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would play major roles in both scandals .\nThe CIA and National Security Council having assembled \u201c the Enterprise \u201d to wage an illegal war on Nicaragua in 1984-1986 employing private contractors who were ex-military or CIA \u2019 s Secord , Clines , Hakim .\nThe NSC would employ the same enterprise to handle logistics in the Iran arms deals starting in the fall of 1985 .\nThis is the mainstream version .\nOn the other hand the true origins of the \u201c Enterprise \u201d went back to much earlier Middle East arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the early 1960 \u2019 s and returned in the late 1970 \u2019 s supervising the Pentagon \u2019 s Military Assistance Program to the Shah \u2019 s Iran .\nSecord was also suspected of being a partner in EATSCO with Thomas Clines , Ted Shackley and Ed Wilson .\nBy beginning the story in Nicaragua I am not implying that this is the true origin of the affair .\nHowever since this article is about the mainstream version of the Iran-Contra affair .\nI will not attempt to trace the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the scandal \u2019 s exposure in 1986 as the Christic Institute attempted to do in their civil case against \u201c The Secret Team \u201d , which inspired my earlier series on the Iran/Contra scandal and my biography of Ted Shackley .\nI will merely comment that Secord and Clines had both been deeply involved in running covert operations with drug smuggling allies in places like Laos and Vietnam .\nI plan to do a whole series on the Contra drug connection next year so I will not deal with that aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Contra leaders of every faction were deeply involved in drug smuggling .\nMoreover all of the US right wing military dictatorships like Guatemala , El Salvador , Argentina , and Chile as well as nominally democratic but brutally repressive countries like Colombia , Mexico and Honduras were involved in drug smuggling .\nAll received tacit permission and CIA protection for this massive drug trade .\nIt is a pattern that has continued long after the Cold War .\nNor is it restricted to Latin America .\nSouth East Asia , Central Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , and increasingly Africa all have their stories of CIA protected drug trades .\nThe CIA is not unique .\nIntelligence agencies around the world are involved in the global drug trade .\nIt is all so obvious that it would be widely known if not for the cowardice of most academics and journalists or more accurately their role in propagandizing the public on behalf of the empire .\nThe war on drugs , like the war on terror , is a complete farce but few dare to point out this fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicaragua from 1912-1933 training a brutal national guard to keep order when they left .\nAnastasio Somoza was the head of this force and always eager to please his American sponsors .\nHe seized power in 1936 and his family would rule the country until overthrown by the Sandinistas on 17 July 1979 .\nThis was during the Jimmy Carter presidency .\nCarter \u2019 s record in Central America was rather more sinister then the myth of his supposed obsession with human rights would suggest .\nHe authorized a massive escalation in military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in office for example .\nCarter had cut off military aid to Somoza because Somoza \u2019 s refusal to negotiate and the regime \u2019 s brutal war crimes endangered the US \u2019 s ability to manage the transition of power .\nCarter hoped to use the promise of aid to keep the Sandinistas in line .\nThere were doubtless secret plans to undermine them at the same time .\nThere is always a \u201c Track 2.\n\u201d Little aid was delivered but Carter \u2019 s policies were viewed as treacherous and weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fantasy world of Reagan and the National Security State what had happened in Nicaragua was not a popular revolution but a sinister Soviet plot to dominate the western hemisphere .\nDestroying Nicaragua and preventing revolutions in El Salvador and Guatemala would become major priorities of the new administration .\nReagan \u2019 s election in 1980 amounted to a soft coup .\nAs I discussed in my introductory article , this also involved illegal campaign contributions from rich oligarchs in El Salvador and Guatemala who were given the green light to commit atrocities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Deaver , future Contra supplier Major General John K. Singlaub and Reagan \u2019 s first National Security Adviser Richard Allen .\nThe Reagan campaign also sent emissaries to the Contras .\nMost importantly the Reagan campaign made a deal with Khomeini \u2019 s faction to prevent the release of the American hostages in Iran , the so-called \u201c October surprise \u201d which personally involved George H.W .\nBush , Bill Casey , Richard Allen and future National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane among other key players in the Iran Contra scandal .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section .\nWhen Reagan came to power in 1981 he began plans to wage his war on Nicaragua .\nIn the fall of 1981 the Contras were a tiny force of 250 men , mostly veterans of Somoza \u2019 s National Guard in exile in Guatemala under the protection of the \u201c Godfather of the death squads \u201d Mario Sandoval Alarcon .\nOthers Contras were in exile in Honduras .\nHonduras would be the Contras main future base backed by the Honduran military , Argentine advisers fresh from their dirty war in Argentina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuban Bay of Pigs veterans .\nFuture Contras were also living in Miami where they had formed an alliance with the Cuban exiles .\nThey engaged in terror attacks , drug dealing , bank robbery and kidnapping to finance their counter-revolution .\nSome survived by means of armed robbery and livestock rustling .\nThey had named themselves the 15th of September Legion .\nThis was the situation in fall of 1981 , when the Reagan administration began its war on Nicaragua .\nIn August 1981 , Duane \u201c Dewey \u201d Clarridge , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin America division , was sent down to Honduras to meet with the Honduran military , who had been working with the Contras and their Argentine advisers .\nClarridge was a veteran of Operation Gladio in both Turkey and Italy .\nDCI Casey had picked him despite the fact that he did not speak Spanish because he was a reckless \u201c cowboy \u201d used to operating above the law doing whatever dirty work was necessary .\nClarridge operated under the alias Maroni while the contras jokingly called him \u201c GarCIA \u201d .\nClarridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when his harbour mining and assassination scandals would alienate Congress and eventually induce it to forbid further aid to the Contras .\nInstead of being fired Casey would promote him to the even more prestigious position of head of the European division .\nIn November 1981 , Reagan signed NSDD 17 authorizing a full-scale covert war on Nicaragua .\nOn 1 December 1981 , Reagan would sign a Presidential Finding on Nicaragua meant to deceive congress as to the full scope of his intentions .\nIn the wake of the CIA scandals in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system of oversight was created .\nHouse and Senate Intelligence committees were set up .\nBefore covert operations could be initiated , the President was required to sign a presidential finding and inform Congress ( effectively the respective intelligence committees and usually no one other than the chair of each committee ) within 30 days .\nReagan and Bill Casey planned a massive expansion of the CIA and in order to get Congress to agree they had included oversight and the need for presidential findings in the bill .\nThis would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandal .\nCasey despised the idea of congressional oversight , keeping Congress in the dark as much as possible .\nCasey even wanted to exempt the CIA from FOIA requests .\nLying to Congress , he claimed that every day a CIA officer resigned over fear that an FOIA request would expose their name .\nReagan would conduct covert operations without signing the proper findings .\nSuch failures could have gotten him impeached .\nIn this case Reagan \u2019 s finding on Nicaragua was a deceptive cover story .\nKnowing that Congress would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overthrow the Nicaraguan government , Reagan and Casey created the cover story that they merely wanted to raise a 500-man force to interdict arms going from Nicaragua to the El Salvadoran guerrillas .\nCongress was kept in the dark about the fact that they were already working to overthrow the Nicaraguan government .\nBill Casey was a key architect of the Iran-Contra affair and the mastermind of the Reagan doctrine that America must wage covert war on any socialist or independently minded country or as they put it \u201c aid freedom fighters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father worked in the sanitation department but was extremely well connected to the Irish political machine in New York .\nCasey became a lawyer and an expert on corporate law and tax evasion , publishing guides for corporations on tax loopholes .\nHe joined the OSS during the war , running intelligence in the European theatre .\nHe loved his job but decided to leave the government and make his fortune .\nActually Casey was part of a network of old ex-OSS men who ran CIA front NGO \u2019 s such as\u2014in Casey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Crusade for Freedom .\nThese were covers for their work with fascist \u00e9migr\u00e9s .\nAnother group of ex-OSS men ran the media and Casey would later acquire huge media holdings .\nThanks to Casey \u2019 s connections and his skills at tax evasion , including inventing the concept of the tax shelter , he got rich .\nHe remained active in politics and was rewarded for his support of Nixon with the position of head of the SEC , The Export Import Bank , and the State Department \u2019 s economic division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deputy Director of Operations in the CIA ; offended he had not been offered the Director spot .\nFinally Reagan was convinced to hire Casey as his campaign manager .\nHe ran the campaign like a covert op , stealing Carter \u2019 s debate book among other dirty tricks .\nHe wanted to be rewarded with the position of Secretary of State or Defence but was rejected because he was a notorious slob and a mumbler .\nInstead he became CIA director , which was elevated to a cabinet post .\nHe would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would also push for a massive expansion of the military \u2019 s special forces .\nHe was impatient with the CIA \u2019 s bureaucracy and despised the analytical division for throwing cold water on the anti-Soviet hysteria the Reagan administration was drumming up .\nHe purged the whole division replacing them with analysts who would toe the party line .\nYet he fully realized how vulnerable the Soviet Union was and helped engineer its downfall .\nTo get around CIA red tape Casey liked to rely on private businessmen and other cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Casey had took an office in the Executive Office Building close to Oliver North \u2019 s .\nNorth met with Casey regularly .\nCasey was a major influence on National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane .\nNorth would report to both Casey and McFarlane on his Iran-Contra project .\nJust as the Iran/Contra scandal was breaking Casey \u2019 s brain cancer incapacitated him .\nHe was sent to a CIA approved hospital for radical brain surgery , which left him conveniently unable to communicate .\nHe died a few months later .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major way in spring 1982 .\nNow renamed the FDN and having the full support of the CIA , the Contras launched 106 attacks between 14 March 1982 and 21 June 1982 .\nThey blew up the bridges connecting Honduras and Nicaragua , assassinated minor government officials and began sniper attacks on Nicaraguan troop convoys .\nAlso in 1982 the CIA would recruit Eden Pastora who played a heroic role during the revolution but turned traitor .\nHe would relocate to Costa Rica where his much smaller ARDE force would attempt to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CIA would recruit 8 civilians with anti-Somoza reputations to serve as the FDN \u2019 s civilian directorate in an attempt to defuse criticism that the FDN was made up of entirely of Somoza \u2019 s National Guard , infamous for the horrific war crimes committed under Somoza and continuing equally horrific crimes against Nicaragua with CIA backing .\nThis was only a small part of the psychological warfare strategy the Reagan administration was waging on the US public and the world at large .\nIn 1982 Casey would transfer veteran CIA propagandist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run the Intelligence division and launch a Public Diplomacy campaign .\nPublic Diplomacy ( like the term public relations ) was the latest euphemism for propaganda and psychological operations .\nRaymond led the campaign to ensure that Reagan \u2019 s delusional analysis of events in Central America would become the prevailing wisdom .\nRaymond and his lackey Otto Reich , who would be in charge of the State Departments office of Public Diplomacy for Latin American affairs or S/LPD , would wage war on investigative journalists .\nThe press was used to \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they failed to follow that script by exposing war crimes in Central America , Otto Reich might personally arrive to bully their editors or producers .\nOliver North worked closely with Raymond and Reich attending over 70 meetings of the S/LPD .\nMany journalists were fired as a result .\nThey also spread wild rumours about journalists critical of administration policy accusing female journalists of having Sandinista lovers and male journalists of being supplied by the Sandinistas with prostitutes of either sex .\nNorth went further , telling the FBI Robert Parry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually died of old age ) .\nThey also set up a network of journalists , who were actually secretly on the state payroll , to write opinion pieces for publication in the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal .\nLater they would also illegally fund the \u201c Contra Lobby \u201d : Carl \u201c Spitz \u201d Channell , Richard Miller , and Frank Gomez who were also working closely with Oliver North raising money to buy arms for the Contras and illegally lobby Congress .\nRaymond \u2019 s main goal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandinistas and white hats on the Contras \u201d in the process he managed to effectively kill investigative journalism by the end of the 1980 \u2019 s , according to Robert Parry one of his victims .\nRaymond called it \u201c Project Truth.\n\u201d Perhaps it is time to fully introduce Oliver North , whose power was steadily growing at the NSC , while \u201c Dewey \u201d Clarridge was running the Contra war .\nIn 8th grade he had been sent away for a year of military school , despite being a very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Marine training camp in high school , he became obsessed with joining the Marines , attended the Naval Academy , was commissioned into the Marines and happily went to Vietnam .\nHis one worry was that the war would end before he could get there .\nNorth was a true believer , never questioning the genocidal war in Vietnam .\nHe led a platoon in Vietnam .\nAfter serving his tour returned to testify on behalf of a friend who had helped massacre a village in an incident the press dubbed \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhile waiting to testify North joined a black ops Marine intelligence unit joining night missions to assassinate Vietnamese on what was basically his vacation .\nNorth got his first taste of fame when he and several Marines signed a letter claiming that in all their time in Vietnam they had never witnessed a single war crime or human rights violation by either American or South Vietnamese forces .\nThis was an absolutely absurd lie but it got him invited onto Firing Line the talk show moderated by ex-CIA media pundit William F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the CIA station chief William Buckley , kidnapped in Beirut ) North began training Marines in counter-insurgency , both stateside and in Okinawa .\nWhen his wife threatened to leave him he had a nervous breakdown in 1974 .\nHe threatened to commit suicide muttering , \u201c I \u2019 m no good \u201d and waving a pistol around .\nHe was hospitalized and recovered .\nHis wife did not leave him .\nThe whole incident was covered up later allowing him to be picked for the NSC .\nIn 1975 he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manpower division where he befriended the top brass .\nHe was promoted to major and then assigned to Camp Lejeune .\nIn 1978 , after a superior officer gave him a faith healing of his leg , North became an enthusiastic born again Christian .\nRaised Catholic he now joined a charismatic Episcopalian church .\nThis would prove useful in the Reagan era since North would also work closely with the Christian Right to drum up support for the Contras .\nHe also joined the influential Council on National Policy ( CNP .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Naval War College .\nIn 1981 National Security Adviser Richard Allen picked North to join the NSC .\nAllen would be replaced as National Security Advisor by William Clark , an old Reagan crony from his days as Governor of California .\nThe NSC suddenly had a lot more access to Reagan .\nClark would be replaced by his deputy Robert McFarlane , who had been an aide to Kissinger during his secret trips to China .\nMcFarlane hoped to emulate his mentor Kissinger raising the power of the National Security Adviser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they soon formed a close father and son type relationship fuelling North \u2019 s meteoric rise .\nOne of North \u2019 s first assignments was to lobby for the AWACS sale to Saudi Arabia when he met Richard Secord who was also deeply involved with the AWACS sale over at the Pentagon .\nNorth was assigned to work on Continuity of Government planning where he worked on contingency plans to suspend the Constitution , declare martial law and round up tens of thousands of anti-war activists and hundreds of thousands of Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrest in response to the invasion of Nicaragua .\nReagan had dreamed of instituting martial law back when he was Governor of California waging war on anti-war protestors , Black and Latino radicals and others .\nLuis Giuffrida as head of California Specialized Training Institute was a key mastermind of this plan called Cable Splicer .\nAs president Reagan appointed Luis Giuffrida to run FEMA .\nIn the Reagan era continuity of government plans would expand from post-nuclear war scenarios to terror attacks including even civil unrest .\nIn 1984 Oliver North would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scheme to funnel \u201c surplus \u201d weapons to the Contras .\nThe 1980s Continuity of Government plans would form the

movement to serve as State Defence Forces who would conduct these round ups of Central American refugees while right wing militias have been allowed to terrorize refugees at the borders for decades .\nNorth also began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving under Roger Fontaine at the NSC , eventually replacing him as the NSC point man in charge of Central America .\nNorth would serve on the Kissinger Commission , which drew up a blueprint for continuing Reagan \u2019 s dirty war in Central America .\nSoon North was serving as the NSC representative on the RIG the Restricted Interagency Group on Central America , where he worked closely with Dewey Clarridge , the CIA representative .\nEventually the RIG , composed of Oliver North of the NSC , CIA Central America Task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Elliot Abrams , would run Central American policy while also supervising Walter Raymond \u2019 s Public Diplomacy campaign as the RIG triumvirate or RIGlet .\nHaving introduced North , let us return to \u201c Dewey \u201d Clarridge \u2019 s Contra war back in late 1982 .\nIn December 1982 in response to the massive expansion of the Contras , their aggressive attacks , reports of massacres , the expansion of the war to Costa Rica ( which since it was south of Nicaragua did not fit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for El Salvador \u201d ) Congress adopted \u201c Boland I \u201d forbidding the Reagan administration from using the Contras to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government .\nReagan signed it and DCI Casey merely ignored it .\nIn Casey \u2019 s view , he could deny that his goal was to overthrow the Nicaraguan government up until he actually succeeded in doing so .\nInstead his worry was that the war was behind schedule .\nIn 1983 there was yet another escalation in the Contra war .\nIn 1983 Dewey Clarridge commissioned the Contra handbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Press would later dub the \u201c assassination manual \u201d or \u201c the murder manual \u201d .\nIt argued for selective terror against loyal Nicaraguans and assassinating contras to create martyrs .\nIgnoring Boland I , it called for the overthrow of the Nicaraguan government .\nIt would cause a scandal when exposed by journalist Robert Parry .\nIn May 1983 Reagan openly praised the Contras as freedom fighters for the first time and bragged that the US was funding them .\nHe would later claim , \u201c I am a Contra.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Founding Fathers .\nHe was serving as the mouthpiece for the public diplomacy campaign , which advised claiming that the Contras were freedom fighters fighting for democracy , when they might more accurately be described , judging them by their tactics and origins , as bloodthirsty death squads and terrorists pining for the days when Nicaragua was run by a fascist dictator .\nThe Contras massacred peasants , raped , tortured , and killed in the grisly manner favoured by CIA-trained death squads , mutilating their victims with knives and machetes .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals and grain silos .\nThey terrorized not just Nicaraguans but Hondurans , and Costa Ricans .\nBy summer 1983 it had become clear that \u201c Dewey \u201d Clarridge would be unable to meet his deadline to topple the Sandinistas by Christmas 1983 .\nCuban and Soviet economic aid were preventing the US sanctions and economic warfare from collapsing the economy .\nNicaragua was successfully repelling the Contra attacks .\n\u201c Dewey \u201d Clarridge came up with a plan to destroy Nicaragua \u2019 s economic infrastructure .\nSince the Contras were not up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIA do it themselves utilizing UCLAs or Unilaterally Controlled Latino Assets Cuban-Americans , Mexican Americans , and Puerto Ricans who were military and probably special forces veterans but who , if killed , could be passed off as Nicaraguans .\nHe purchased a huge mother ship as a base for a fleet of speedboats and starting in fall 1983 began trying to destroy Nicaragua \u2019 s oil infrastructure .\nOn 8 September 1983 , the UCLAs attacked an oil pipeline and docks at Puerto Sandino .\nOn 10 October 1983 , the UCLAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Corinto , forcing the entire town to evacuate .\nIn December 1983 , as a compromise between those who wanted to end all aid to Contras and those who wanted it to continue , Congress voted to cap Contra aid at USD 24 million in fiscal year 1984 .\nUndeterred Dewey Clarridge presented a plan to Casey to mine Nicaraguan harbours , an act of open warfare under international law .\nCasey and Reagan gave Dewey Clarridge the green light .\n\u201c Dewey \u201d Clarridge convinced the Contra leadership to take responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s UCLAs who carried out the mining .\nThe mining began on 1 January and lasted until 24 April 1984 .\nCasey claimed he had properly informed Congress but since he was a mumbler and it was buried in the middle of his testimony no one had noticed .\nWhile Casey had mentioned the mining he had lied and said the Contras had carried out the mining .\nIn any case when the Press reported the mining in April 1984 , it was a major scandal .\nDewey Clarridge had spent nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1984 budget on the mining and other attacks .\nWhen the scandal broke Clarridge was in South Africa begging for arms and cash to fund the Contras .\nSouth Africa was willing to send arms and money since it was working closely with the US running its own Contra-style wars in Angola and Mozambique .\nNicaragua \u2019 s Cuban allies were aiding Angola \u2019 s MPLA government against what became a disastrous South African invasion .\nThe Reagan administration decided that because of the mining scandal it should avoid further controversy that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartheid regime\u2014although Reagan was one of its strong supporters .\nEventually the harbour mining scandal and the assassination manual scandal would lead to the passage of Boland II in October 1984 .\nIn the meantime Reagan would order his National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane to find a way to keep the Contras together \u201c Body and Soul \u201d even if Congress cut off their funds .\nMcFarlane picked his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Oliver North to run the operation .\nIt had been planned to hand the Contra war over to the NSC back in 1983 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was imposed .\nIn February 1984 McFarlane had asked Israel to take over the Contras .\nThe Israelis had basically taken over for the US in Guatemala although the US was secretly still heavily involved there .\nMcFarlane hoped they would play a similar role advising the Contras .\nIsrael refused for fear of endangering their bipartisan stranglehold on the US Congress , but they would play a key role in arming the Contras .\nDewey Clarridge introduced North to the Contra leaders as the new point man on the Contra operation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ run the Contra resupply operation .\nNorth sent Secord down to meet with the Contras and obtain \u201c a shopping list \u201d of weapons and supplies they needed .\nSecord would be in charge of weapons procurement charging a 38 % mark-up to the Contras .\nHis partner Iranian exile Albert Hakim began setting up a network of shell companies like Energy Resources International , Lake Resources , Udall Corp , and Amalgamated Commercial Enterprises , adding to the shell companies and fronts they had already set up as part of their business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called it the Enterprise while North called it \u201c Project Democracy \u201d , the dark underbelly of the newly created National Endowment for Democracy .\nAll this is standard operating procedure in the shadowy world of military contractors , arms dealers , offshore bankers , private intelligence firms , transport specialists , and crisis management populated by ex-spies , ex-military operating under the unofficial protection of the US and other governments .\nSoon Secord hired his old EATSCO partner Thomas Clines to handle the arms deal when his first deal involving Canada \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the fake Guatemalan end user certificates .\nThese had made China hesitant because Guatemala was a close ally of Taiwan .\nClines \u2019 source was Defex of Portugal whose board had close ties to Clines .\nClines would bring in CIA Cuban and assassin Rafael \u201c Chi Chi \u201d Quintero to run things on the ground in El Salvador .\nAnother key member of the Enterprise was Rob Owen supposedly a civilian .\nOwen \u2019 s brother was in the State Department ( or possibly CIA ) and was killed in Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Rescue Committee , a CIA front , in Vietnam .\nHe then joined future Vice President Dan Quayle \u2019 s staff .\nCIA rancher John Hull paid him a visit and Owen became obsessed with helping the Contras .\nHe went to work for CIA-tied Gray & Co , a PR firm owned by Robert Keith Gray who had long worked with the CIA in looting Latin America .\nThe Contras tried to hire Gray & Co to do their PR but the deal was vetoed by a former Kennedy aid .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FDN and soon became North \u2019 s courier to the Contras .\nOwen worshipped North whom he called \u201c The Hammer \u201d and \u201c Old Blood and Guts.\n\u201d Owen ran his own one-man pro-contra NGO IDEA .\nIn addition to setting up a privatized network to cope with reduced CIA involvement it was necessary to find a new source of funds .\nNational Security Adviser Robert McFarlane turned to the Saudis , meeting with Ambassador Bandar Bin Sultan ( aka \u201c Bandar Bush \u201d ) in May 1984 .\nAmbassador Bandar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million a month to the Contras with the permission of King Fahd .\nIn February 1985 the Saudi \u2019 s would double their donation after President Reagan met with King Fahd .\nThe Saudis total contribution was USD 32 million .\nWACL head retired General John Singlaub and Oliver North eventually convinced Taiwan to donate USD 2.7 million .\n\u201c Dewey \u201d Clarridge had gotten the South Africans to provide arms money and advisers but the deal was cancelled or delayed due to the harbour mining scandal .\nSouth Africa did supply millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and New Right propagandists the Reagan Administration relied on to sell their policies to the public and pressure or unseat congressional opponents critical of the Contras and other Reagan policies .\nIn 1986 prior to the scandal breaking Elliot Abrams convinced the Sultan of Brunei to give USD 10 million to the Contras but due to a supposed clerical error by Fawn Hall , North \u2019 s secretary , the money ended up instead in the Swiss bank account of Israeli expat Bruce Rappaport a shadowy figure ( i.e .\nconnected to organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Israeli Labour Party ) Rappaport was a key element in the Iraqgate schemes to build a Bechtel oil pipeline in Iraq .\nRappaport had promised to pay tens of millions of dollars to Israeli politicians for the promise not to blow up the Iraqi pipeline .\nAbrams would almost land in prison for his blanket denials to Congress when questioned on whether the State Department was soliciting 3rd country donors saying , \u201c We are not in the fundraising business \u201d .\nThe Reagan Administration would solicit aid from over two dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was also vital to keep Central American countries supportive of the Contras , a policy that was as unpopular in their countries as it was in the US .\nTheir support was maintained via illegal quid pro quo deals .\nThe Reagan administration could only ask for aid to the Contras if there were no strings attached , if congress was informed and if there was a presidential finding .\nPresident Reagan and Vice President Bush would personally violate the law intervening with heads of state in Central America offering quid pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the countries agreed to support the Contras they would get huge increases in military and economic aid .\nIf they tried to interfere with the Contras they were threatened with aid cut offs .\nIn El Salvador and Guatemala these arms shipments would be used in their US backed dirty wars on peasants and workers that would claim 300,000 lives .\nMexico was home to Contra training camps under the protection of the infamous Guadalajara cartel that were considered so sensitive that DEA agent Enrique \u201c Kiki \u201d Camarena Salazar and Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were both murdered to cover it up .\nBuendia was assassinated by Mexico \u2019 s CIA trained DFS .\nBush \u2019 s man Felix Rodriguez was there to interrogate \u201c Kiki \u201d Camarena as the cartel tortured him to death .\nGuatemala was used to supply fake end user certificates for the Enterprise \u2019 s Contra arms deals .\nEl Salvador \u2019 s Ilopongo airbase would be the supply depot for the Contras as Honduras did not want direct supply flights from the US .\nBush \u2019 s National Security Adviser Donald Gregg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an adviser on using helicopter strike teams in their dirty war in the countryside as well as to run the Contra resupply at Ilopongo .\nRodriguez had run a similar program under Gregg in Vietnam when they were in the CIA .\nRodriguez had formed a tight bond with the El Salvadoran Air Force General Juan Rafael Bustillo .\nBefore leaving for El Salvador Rodriguez met with Bush and then SouthCom Commander in chief Paul Gorman who flew Rodriguez down to Ilopongo .\nEventually Rodriguez would clash with the Enterprise .\nHonduras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US was constantly forced to intervene whenever Honduras would threaten to withdraw support or jealously seize Contra weapon shipments of surface to air missiles that the US supplied to the Contras but not Honduras .\nVice President Bush personally flew to Honduras as Reagan \u2019 s special envoy to offer a quid pro quo to Honduran President Suazo .\nAmusingly at an earlier National Security Planning Group meeting Bush had warned the cabinet that such quid pro quos were illegal .\nThe Honduran military , who worked closely with the Contras , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smuggling operation .\nHonduran General Jose Bueso-Rosa was busted in Florida and USD 40 million in cocaine was seized by the FBI .\nGeneral Buso Rosa was planning to use this drug deal to finance the assassination of Honduras \u2019 new President .\nOliver North and Elliot Abrams lobbied on his behalf to get the charges dropped and when that failed to get him a lighter sentence in a minimum-security prison .\nThey were worried General Bueso-Rosa might expose the illegal contra resupply operation .\nPanama was a key Contra supporter General Noriega @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mad Mike \u201d Harari a notorious Mossad veteran who was making a fortune supplying Panama \u2019 s air force with US parts and using that as a cover to smuggle cocaine to the US .\nA long-time CIA asset Noriega donated tens of millions to the Contras along with his business partner Harari in exchange for the US \u2019 s ignoring his involvement in drug smuggling and money laundering .\nPanama would supply an explosives expert to ex-SAS British mercenary David Walker for an attack that blew up an arms depot in downtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed a nearby military hospital .\nJust prior to the Iran/Contra scandal breaking Oliver North met personally with Noriega on a plan to pay Panama one million dollars and fix Noriega \u2019 s PR problems in exchange for Noriega \u2019 s help launching terror attacks on Nicaragua .\nNoriega offered to loan the US teams to carry out assassinations .\nThe plan also called for setting up a Contra training base in Panama where Panamanian and Israeli advisers would create a western front in the Contra war targeting the capital Managua .\nNoriega @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Seymour Hersh had exposed Noriega \u2019 s drug empire in the New York Times a couple months before .\nCasey and Bush had also held personal meetings with Noriega .\nCosta Rica was host to a much smaller Contra force than Honduras but was even more resistant to supporting the Contras .\nIt was home to secret airstrips used to supply the Contras .\nThe most infamous was John Hull \u2019 s ranch where drugs were smuggled , mercenaries housed , and the La Penca bombing was allegedly planned .\nThe La @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEden Pastora had refused to merge his forces with the FDN , ignoring a CIA ultimatum .\nEight people were killed , including three journalists , one of whom was an American , Linda Frazier .\nSeventeen were injured , including Tony Avirgan .\nAvirgan and his wife Martha Honey would investigate the bombing .\nThe trail would lead to John Hull \u2019 s Ranch and a meeting attended by North \u2019 s courier Rob Owen and CIA station chief Joe Fernandez .\nFor months Hull had been plotting the assassination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Commie.\n\u201d Mercenaries who frequented Hull \u2019 s ranch claimed that there was also a plot to kill Ambassador Lewis Tambs and blame Nicaragua as a pretext for a US invasion .\nIt would also allow the Contras to collect a million dollar bounty the Medellin Cartel had put on Tambs .\nAvirgan and Honey sought the aid of the Christic Institute when Hull sued them for libel and tried to frame them as drug traffickers .\nEventually they became the plaintiffs in the Christic Institute civil lawsuit against the Iran Contra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Santa Elena airstrip which North had the Enterprise purchase through the dummy corporation , Udall Research Corporation , set up by North \u2019 s friend ex-Marine William Haskell under the fake name Robert Olmstead .\nNorth \u2019 s alias throughout the Iran Contra affair was \u201c William Goode \u201d Secord \u2019 s was Richard Copp .\nCopp Goode and Olmstead were listed as the board of directors of Udall Research Corporation .\nThe airstrip was built through the efforts of Ambassador Lewis Tambs and CIA chief of Station Joe Fernandez .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security Benjamin Piza was on the CIA payroll and was the airstrip \u2019 s Costa Rican protector .\nHis reward was a trip to DC for a personal photo op with Reagan .\nCIA chief of station Fernandez would blatantly violate the Boland amendment by serving as the Contra \u2019 s communications officer supervising arms drops .\nCharges were later dropped against Fernandez when the CIA refused to cooperate .\nWhen Oscar Arias was elected President of Costa he ordered Santa Elena shut down , but his government ignored him .\nEventually in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expose the Udall Corporation despite the panicked efforts of the Reagan Administration .\nArias would later win the Nobel Prize for his Arias Peace plan , the blueprint for ending Central America \u2019 s bloody dirty wars .\nIn addition to seeking donations and support from other governments North partnered with a domestic fundraising network raising illegal tax-free donations for the Contras ; funding a vast domestic propaganda campaign on behalf of Reagan \u2019 s Central American dirty wars and engaging in illegal meddling with congressional elections .\nCarl \u201c Spitz \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a network of NGO \u2019 s like the NEPL ( The National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty ) and ACT ( The American Conservative Trust ) .\nHis network was closely tied with that of Richard Miller and Frank Gomez who ran IBC ( International Business Communications ) and other shell companies funded by NEPL and the US State departments S/LPD ( Latin American Public Diplomacy . )\nNorth would be his unofficial partner .\nNorth would give a sales pitch in the form of an intelligence briefing often at his NSC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could reduce donors to tears .\nThen after explaining what the Contras needed and what it cost he would exit the room and Channell would ask for a donation .\nThe biggest funders were right wing widows like Ellen Garwood .\nThe Contras named the helicopter she bought them the Lady Ellen in her honour and she donated millions to Channell .\nHollywood had this elderly widow played by Julia Roberts in Charlie Wilson \u2019 s War since she was also a key backer of the Afghan Mujahedeen .\nThe second biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nelson Bunker Hunt and Joseph Coors , who had been funding a vast network of warmongering , racist , sexist and homophobic NGO \u2019 s for decades .\nHunt , Coors and other men gave hundreds of thousands to the NEPL .\nDonors who gave over $ 300,000 were rewarded with a personal meeting with President Reagan .\nNorth wrote them thank you notes on NSC stationary , and sent them commemorative souvenirs , while Channell would send the lonely widows gift baskets for the holidays .\nThe NEPL raised USD 3.9 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1986 .\nThe NEPL spent half the money it raised on USD 5 million in consulting fees and salaries for Channell and his cronies .\nA quarter went to the Contras via Secord \u2019 s Lake Resources Swiss accounts USD 2.7 million .\nAnother USD 2.3 million funded the \u201c Contra Lobby \u201d which bought attack ads in states with swing votes on Contra funding .\nThey also funded a vast domestic propaganda campaign on behalf of the Contras .\nAlthough the public remained opposed in 1985 Congress gave in and voted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d to the Contras .\nIn summer 1986 their lobbying campaign would convince Congress to vote USD 100 million in lethal aid to the Contras .\nHowever there was a 3-month delay before the funds became available so the illegal resupply operation continued , only to be exposed on 5 October 1986 when a plane carrying arms was shot down .\nThe Contras relied on three main arms dealers , \u201c The Arms Supermarket \u201d , Secord \u2019 s Enterprise , and Singlaub \u2019 s GeoMiliTech .\nAs North and Secord \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North forced the Contras to buy solely from \u201c The Enterprise \u201d and even put \u201c The Enterprise \u201d in charge of all the Contras funds .\nThe Arms Supermarket had been set up with the support of Vice President Bush , and his National Security Adviser Donald Gregg , who sent Felix Rodriguez to help supervise it .\nIt was founded with USD 14 million in drug money ( according to North ) and was run by Ronald Martin , James McCoy , and Mario Dellamico another Cuban exile .\nIt ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in weapons .\nIt was closely allied to the Honduran Military via Colonel Hector Aplicano and the Israelis .\nThe Arms Supermarket was implicated in the death of money launderer and Cuban exile John F. Molina , who was killed by a Colombian hit team in Panama .\nGeoMiliTech ( GMT ) was owned by Barbara Studley , a former beauty queen turned talk show host .\nGeoMiliTech was a strange company .\nIt partnered with both China and Israel to supply Chinese and East Bloc weapons to \u201c Contras \u201d waging covert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethiopia , Cambodia and of course Nicaragua .\nThey also bought East Bloc arms from Austrian arms dealer Werner Glatt , who supplied the CIA with East Bloc weapons .\nGMT became an exclusive dealer for certain Israeli weapons systems and had offices in Israel .\nGMT supplied USD 5.3 million in weapons to the Contras .\nBehind Barbara Studley were General John K. Singlaub and General Daniel Graham the former head of the DIA .\nSinglaub had been forced to retire as head of US and Korean forces in South Korea after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reductions in South Korea .\nHe had served in the OSS in China and Europe , the CIA and the military in Korea and had headed the Special Operations Group in Vietnam ( SOG-MACV . )\nHe had started the new US WACL branch the USCWF the US Council on World Freedom and would be elected to head WACL worldwide The World Communist League was an umbrella group combining fascist \u00e9migr\u00e9s and former Nazis , right wing politicians , drug dealing Asian dictators , and Latin American death squad heads like Mario Sandoval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the 1980s WACL was a vehicle for implementing the Reagan doctrine of global \u201c low intensity warfare \u201d , generating solidarity among fascists worldwide and support for World War 3 as they called the \u201c cold war \u201d .\nThe Ukrainians had actually long argued for the need to start a nuclear war to \u201c liberate \u201d Eastern Europe .\nWACL was used as a diversion from North \u2019 s enterprise funnelling private donations to the Contras .\nSinglaub sent millions in non-lethal aid to the Contras on behalf of WACL .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Korea who funded the US chapter of WACL and whom he would approach to solicit donations with North and McFarlane \u2019 s permission .\nWhen the Hasenfus flight was shot down , exposing the illegal contra resupply operation , Elliot Abrams tried to blame the whole thing on Singlaub , who angrily denied it .\nGeoMiliTech would later go bankrupt in the 1990 \u2019 s as a result of embezzlement and fraud .\nThe Enterprise purchased its weapons from DEFEX in Portugal , arms bought with fake Guatemalan end user certificates .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meeting of Contra leaders in Miami including Adolfo Calero and Richard Secord .\nNorth set the stage by tearing into Adolfo Calero about corruption and incompetence in Contra ranks .\nThen he announced that from then on the Enterprise would be in charge of the Contras funds .\nHe also announced The Enterprise would set up a system to airdrop arms to Contras in the field .\nSecord recruited Richard Gadd to run the Enterprise \u2019 s private air force , later replacing him with the more competent Robert Dutton .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s failed hostage rescue back in 1980 that had ended in disaster .\nGadd set up a shell company to rent planes from \u201c former \u201d CIA airline SAT Southern Air Transport , which had a long history of drug trafficking .\nIt took a while to get going .\nMany of the air drops had to be cancelled because the Contras failed to signal or the pilots could not find the drop zones .\nEventually weapons were being dropped airdropped or unloaded in Honduras , Costa Rica , and within Nicaragua itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they could carry .\nIt was all based in Ilopongo military airbase .\nThe CIA owned one hangar while North \u2019 s Enterprise controlled the other .\nFelix Rodriguez , and Colonel James Steele , the head of US advisers in El Salvador ( who would later set up death squads in Iraq ) , worked with the Salvadorans and the Enterprise pilots .\nAlso there was Cuban exile terrorist Luis Posada Carriles , who had blown up a Cubana airliner in 1976 killing 73 people .\nAnother CIA Cuban in Ilopongo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working for Tom Clines .\nPredictably Ilopongo became a major drug smuggling hub .\nIn 1985 Congress caved in and voted USD 27 million in \u201c humanitarian assistance \u201d to the Contras .\nThe CIA and the military were barred from having anything to do with it so the State Department set up the NHAO Nicaraguan Humanitarian Assistance Office run by Robert Duemling .\nHowever unknown to Congress , Robert Duemling was forced to answer to North , Fiers and Elliot Abrams of the RIG .\nThey forced him to hire Rob Owen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enterprise as well as known drug traffickers to carry \u201c humanitarian assistance.\n\u201d NHAO flights were run out of Ilopongo and Felix Rodriguez did not bother to keep the NHAO operation separate from that of the Enterprise .\nBy day they were NHAO flights by night the same planes and pilots were used to fly arms .\nIn late 1985 North got the idea to use the proceeds of the Iran arms sales to fund the Contras .\nEarly in 1986 Reagan adopted North and Poindexter \u2019 s plan to cut the Israelis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Enterprise act as the middleman .\nThe diversion idea soon was put into place although Secord and Hakim did not send the Contras as much as North wanted , giving them around USD 3.5 million instead of the USD 12 million North had originally envisioned in the \u201c Diversion Memo \u201d .\nThey had operating costs and of course wanted to make a hefty profit .\nNorth , the true believer , was not above a bit of petty corruption himself when he had funnelled the Saudi money to the Contras Cayman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calero had then sent North $ 100,000 in travellers \u2019 checks North could use to cover expenses .\nNorth used this slush fund however he pleased , issuing travellers \u2019 checks to Rob Owen and Fawn Hall as well as spending them on himself .\nNorth also had Secord buy him an electric gate installed by ex-CIA man Glen Robinette .\nSecord had also hired Robinette to dig up dirt on Tony Avirgan and Martha Honey down in Costa Rica .\nFinally Secord \u2019 s partner Albert Hakim set up a USD 200,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event of North \u2019 s death .\nBy fall of 1986 , USD 100 million in congressional funds were about to become available .\nEarlier in the year Reagan , North and Abrams had come up with a \u201c Plan B \u201d .\nIf Contra aid failed to pass they would have had the Contras seize a strip of Nicaraguan territory defended by the Guatemalan and El Salvadoran militaries , which the US would then recognize as an independent state allowing Reagan to send tens of millions in emergency aid .\nAbrams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizing Juan Guiado as Venezuela \u2019 s president so they could seize all the countries assets .\nHowever Walter Raymonds Public Diplomacy and the NEPL Contra lobby managed to pressure congress into passing the USD 100 million in aid .\nNorth was relieved .\nHe had only been sleeping 3 or 4 hours a night for years , he was so busy .\nHe was starting to go a bit crazy .\nMcFarlane and his replacement John Poindexter worried .\nNorth hoped the CIA would buy the Enterprise air force for a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a new theatre in the war perhaps Africa .\nThe Reagan administration was on the verge of getting away with blatantly violating the Boland amendment .\nIt had been exposed in the Press back in 1985 and again in 1986 but the Press backed off once Congress decided to accept North , McFarlane , and Poindexter \u2019 s lame denials .\nOn 5 October 1986 , one of the Enterprise planes flown by Buzz Sawyer and William Cooper flew from Ilopongo , down Nicaragua 's coast into Costa Rica and into southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane down with a Soviet surface to air missile launcher .\nEugene Hasenfus \u201c the kicker \u201d was the only one wearing a parachute and managed to jump out of the crashing plane wandering the jungle before being captured the next morning and paraded around the capital and in front of international television .\nFelix Rodriguez had been the first to break the news of the missing flight , calling the Vice President \u2019 s office .\nDonald Gregg was out so he told Gregg \u2019 s aide Sam Wilson .\nNorth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got the news .\nThe plane had once belonged to infamous CIA drug smuggler Barry Seal .\nSeal had been killed 19 February 1986 by a Colombian hit squad after threatening to expose the Contra resupply operation and Vice President George H.W .\nBush .\nAfter their arrest the Colombian \u2019 s said they were taking orders from a lieutenant colonel they later identified as Oliver North .\nThat story would be buried .\nThe mainstream version was that Seal was killed by the Colombians after being exposed as a DEA informant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to frame the Sandinista \u2019 s for drug trafficking .\nHasenfus \u2019 testimony provoked a media firestorm by claiming he was working for the CIA and naming \u201c Max Gomez \u201d .\nThe Press discovered the phone records of one of the Enterprise safe houses showing calls to the NSC .\nReagan , Secretary of State Schultz , and Elliot Abrams all went public denying any government connection to the Contra resupply operation .\nAbrams went on CNN and issued one of his trademark blanket denials even when asked specifically about a possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no idea who \u201c Max Gomez \u201d was .\nSo did the CIA \u2019 s Deputy Director of Operations Claire George , who held in his hands a briefing book identifying Max Gomez as Felix Rodriguez .\nMeanwhile the entire Enterprise air force was supposedly flown out of El Salvador to the US where it was buried with massive quantities of explosives , blown up , then set on fire .\nI find it a little hard to believe since usually these CIA drug planes are transferred from shell company to shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYet again many in the media and Congress choose to accept administration denials of involvement in supporting the Contras in violation of the Boland Amendment , ignoring the mountains of evidence implicating the Reagan Administration .\nIt was only when the Iran deal was exposed the next month and Attorney General Edwin Meese exposed the \u201c diversion \u201d of profits to the Contras that the scandal would finally explode .\nEd Meese had seized on the diversion memo to divert attention from Reagan \u2019 s involvement in the illegal Iran arms sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conducted without a presidential finding and in violation of the Arms Export Control Act , been exposed , President Reagan could have faced impeachment , with jail sentences for many of the Iran-Contra conspirators .\nAt least that is what might have happened if American \u2019 s truly lived in a democracy rather then a national security state .\nI will deal with the Iran

"and the Triumph of the National Security State My next article will deal in depth with the illegal Contra resupply operation and the Iran arms deal .\nThis article is meant to serve as a brief introduction to the case followed by a much broader analysis of the whole Iran-Contra era .\nI thought it was best to get some tangents out of my system in this extended introduction .\nIn following the threads that make up the tapestry of the Iran-Contra scandal one is quickly covered with a web of connections that cover the world .\nThe globalization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not begin in this era , reached new heights .\nFaced with the threat of congressional oversight the national security state outsourced covert operations to allied and even enemy countries .\nIt also increasingly privatized covert war , turning to networks of ex-spies and military men , arms dealers , mercenaries , NGO \u2019 s lobbyists , religious groups , and drug cartels .\nThe Iran Contra era stretches from late 1975-1992 covering the final third of the Cold War , which begins in the aftermath of the liberation and reunification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Empire .\nThe first post-war chapter of the Cold war had stretched from 1945 ( secretly 1943 ) to 1959 with the Cuban Revolution marking the beginning of the second part of the Cold War .\nThe Cold War had actually begun in 1917 with the Russian revolution and the failed invasion to crush the Soviet Union , followed by the attempt to isolate the USSR , while arming Nazi Germany for an attack on the USSR .\nWorld War 2 was only a minor interruption in this cold war .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WW2 as the British attempted to install the Greek fascist collaborators and death squads into power and to destroy the communist partisans that had already liberated Greece .\nThe OSS and MI6 were already planning to recruit the Nazis and their allies to battle the Soviets .\nThe post-war cold war had seen dissent crushed to make way for an anti-Soviet hysteria , the fixing of the Italian elections to prevent a communist victory , the victory of the Chinese Revolution , the US partition of Korea and its subsequent war to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Vietnam , coups in Iran and Guatemala and around the world .\nThe Second third of the Cold War covered the Cuban Revolution , the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion , the export of US counter-insurgency advisers around the world to teach torture , and assassination to prevent \u201c another Cuba \u201d and the transformation of the Vietnam war from a covert counter-insurgency campaign to a genocidal military occupation .\nHowever the empire managed a major diplomatic success opening relations with the People \u2019 s Republic of China .\nIn the Iran-Contra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm and sometimes train counter-revolutionary forces around the world including UNITA in Angola , the Nicaraguan Contras , and the Afghan Mujahedeen .\nIt also worked with the US backing the Khmer rouge in Cambodia and waging war on Vietnam .\nDomestically during this second phase of the cold war the civil rights movement and the anti-war movement had briefly awakened some awareness of the ugly realities of the empire .\nWatergate , the Pinochet coup in Chile , exposed an imperial presidency and the CIA \u2019 s role in replacing democratic socialism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the post-independence war in Angola when Cuba intervened to foil a US-backed invasion from apartheid South Africa .\nCongress passed the Clark amendment barring further US involvement but the CIA merely turned to its allies in the Safari club to continue the war , which would last until 1992 .\nThe Safari club would also play a key role in giving birth to Al Qaeda .\nThe CIA was already meddling in Afghanistan by the late 70s , in part through the Shah of Iran .\nThe Cuban victory in Angola would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South African apartheid regime in the early 90s .\nHowever at the same time American soft power ( the NED ) had infiltrated and destroyed the Soviet Union , thanks to the treachery and incompetence of Mikhail Gorbachev .\nGorbachev was himself overthrown and the Soviet Union disbanded .\nThe Warsaw pact was absorbed into NATO .\nRussia was ruled by a drunken US puppet named Boris Yeltsin .\nHundreds of millions were plunged into poverty and chaos as the country was looted .\nBetween 1975-1992 the US waged covert and overt dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libya , Angola , Mozambique , Namibia , Uganda , Congo , Chad , Ethiopia , Somalia , Lebanon , Syria , Grenada , Cambodia , East Timor , Guatemala , El Salvador , Argentina , Nicaragua , Panama , Uruguay , Ecuador , Chile and more .\nThe US was supplying both sides in the Iran/Iraq war .\nIt was backing Israel \u2019 s plans to dominate and balkanize the Middle East .\nIt was backing South Africa \u2019 s efforts to dominate Southern Africa .\nThese were the true crimes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American empire .\nIt would take a team of historians to catalogue all the covert wars of the Iran-Contra era , which covered four presidencies , Ford , Carter , Reagan , and Bush and to begin to assess the death count .\nThe Clinton years , that strange period between the end of the Cold War and the beginning of the War on Terror , saw the US create chaos around the globe in order to justify the continued existence of the National Security State : the destruction of Yugoslavia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congo which lead to millions of dead were examples of sophisticated psychological warfare .\nThe US covertly instigated civil wars , fuelling ethnic and tribal strife , while pretending merely to be a concerned bystander and eventually \u201c saviours \u201d when they overtly intervened .\nThe Clinton years , with the destruction of Yugoslavia and its massive NATO expansion , set the stage for the second cold war .\nThe conventional narrative of Iran-Contra Scandal was consciously created to narrow the focus in time and geography so as to expose as little as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also narrowed the focus to avoid the domestic implications of the scandal .\nCongress only investigated activities between 1984-1986 .\nThus the soft coup that brought Reagan to power in 1980 could remain shrouded .\nBack in late 1975 , CIA director William Colby had been fired and replaced with George H. W. Bush .\nBush \u2019 s ties to the agency went back to the 1950 \u2019 s when he was recruited into the CIA , a fact he successfully kept secret for decades .\nWhile Ambassador to China , Bush and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had recruited Deng Xiaoping who would later rule China and rollback socialism .\nBush \u2019 s reign as CIA director in 1976 was brief but memorable .\nHe was in charge when Cuban forces managed to halt the South African advance in Angola .\nHe turned to the Safari Club to help the US wage war in Angola .\nHe was in charge when the Argentine junta seized power and began their bloody dirty war .\nBush was CIA director when the CIA Cubans formed CORU and launched an international terrorist campaign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The culprit Louis Posada Carrilles would later mysteriously \u201c escape \u201d ( via CIA bribes ) from a Venezuelan prison and end up as part of the Contra resupply operation .\n1976 was also the year of the Orlando Letlier bombing when Chile \u2019 s former Ambassador was killed in a car bomb set by CIA Cubans working for DINA ( Chilean Intelligence . )\nBush had ignored the warnings he received that DINA assassins were trying to obtain fake passports for the assassination .\nAfter it took place he tried to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect fascist Chile .\nWhen President Carter won the 1976 election promising to reform the National Security State , Bush begged him to let him keep his job .\nCarter refused and Bush vowed revenge .\nOver 40 former and current CIA employees made up the CIA officers for Bush contingent during the Republican primary and the 1980 election .\nReagan \u2019 s campaign manager was an old OSS hand Bill Casey who had also invented the tax shelter .\nHe created his own team of spies that had moles inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NSC , a Bush loyalist .\nThey set out to destabilize Carter .\nTheir friends in the oil industry launched a full-scale economic war on the US to create a phony oil shortage .\nCarter \u2019 s brother was lured into a Libyan arms deal and then exposed .\nFinally the Reagan campaign resorted to outright treason negotiating a deal with Iran for a huge amount of weapons in exchange for not freeing the hostages until after the election .\nThis part of the scandal is so shocking ( to most Americans ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the evidence that has emerged over the years in support of it .\nIt is known as the October Surprise .\nThere is another theory called the deep October Surprise in which the US , the UK and France and their allies with Savak and the Shah \u2019 s government intentionally helped install Khomeini as preferable to a nationalist or socialist style government in Iran .\nThe October surprise arms deal undermined the secular minded Iranian President Bani Sadr while elevating Khomeini \u2019 s faction .\nThe whole world has been reshaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has triumphed at home and abroad .\nReagan can never be allowed to be exposed as a traitor .\nThe fact that it is accepted that his policies lead to mass murder and genocide around the world show the minor importance most Westerners place on the lives of billions of Third World people .\nTo get excited or angry about such things is bad form .\nNo US president has ever been prosecuted for war crimes .\nThe Iran-Contra era can thus be seen from multiple angles .\nAmerica \u2019 s War on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vs the illusion of democracy .\nThe triumph of capitalism , the slashing of the social safety net .\nThe taming of the media .\nThe triumphant return to impunity for the CIA .\nThe rise of Bush from CIA director to President .\nThe mobilization of the Christian right and far right voters .\nThe rise of the imperial presidency .\nThe triumph of the executive branch over any form of checks and balances .\nThe birth of the NED .\nIran-Contra is part of an interlocking pattern of scandals , coups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the early years of the Cold War and before .\nParticularly relevant are the coups in Guatemala and Iran , the Bay of Pigs , the JFK , MLK , and RFK and Malcolm X assassinations , Vietnam , the secret war in Laos , Watergate , The Chilean coup of 1973 , the Letelier bombing , GLADIO , Nugan Hand , Koreagate , the Ed Wilson affair , the EATSCO scandal , Iraqgate , WACL , BCCI , Inslaw .\nA rotating cast of characters making multiple appearances .\nPeople @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ted Shackley , Thomas Clines , Richard Secord , and George H.W .\nBush .\nThe same names keep popping up .\nThe never-ending scandal of the CIA drug connection .\nThe way things \u201c really work \u201d money laundering , fraud , corruption as standard operating procedure in the alliance between politicians , organized crime , intelligence , and big business that form the basis for the study of \u201c Deep Politics \u201d As I write it is the 35th anniversary of the unravelling of the Iran-Contra scandal .\nThe Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Nicaragua funded in part with profits from the sale to Iran of anti-tank and surface-to-air missiles in exchange for freeing American hostages .\nBack in 1984 Congress had passed the Second Boland Amendment forbidding any aid or advice to the Contras after the CIA was caught mining Nicaraguan harbours and supplying the Contras with what the Press had dubbed an \u201c Assassination Manual \u201d , a Phoenix program style guide to psychological warfare and armed propaganda .\nCongress was less offended by the Contras numerous war crimes than the constant lies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing in Nicaragua .\nCasey had gotten them to agree originally to a 500-man force whose purpose was solely to prevent Nicaragua from arming the Salvadoran guerrillas\u2014the FMLN , who were attempting to overthrow the US-supported , mass-murdering regime in San Salvador .\nIn a couple years they had grown to 12,000 men .\nCongress passed the first Boland amendment forbidding the Contras from being used to overthrow the Nicaraguan government , Reagan \u2019 s and Casey \u2019 s actual goal .\nNow by authorizing the harbour mining without properly informing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe fact that the Contras operated like a death squad mutilating some village doctor for providing health care or a teacher for providing education were less important to Congress .\nThe story of the National Security Council and Oliver North \u2019 s role in waging an illegal war against Nicaragua had begun to leak in the Press in 1985 thanks to journalists Robert Parry , Brian Barger and Alfonso Chardy .\nHowever when Congress chose to accept administration denials , Parry \u2019 s editors at AP tried to kill the story .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House Intelligence Committee and who later chaired the Iran/Contra hearings , who decided to trust North and ignore the investigative journalists .\nThe media was secretly aware that Oliver North was negotiating the hostages release because some of the hostages were journalists .\nHowever the colluded in the cover up rather than risk sabotaging the deals .\nNorth was in fact in regular contact with Parry \u2019 s editors at AP on efforts to release AP journalist Terry Anderson .\nNorth was also a favourite source for journalists .\nNorth \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret .\nThere was also a civil suit filed by the Christic Institute in the wake of the La Penca bombing which hoped to expose a vast criminal conspiracy by ex-CIA and ex-military who were acting as private contractors in the illegal Contra resupply operation and an even more illegal drug importation operation .\nOn 5 October 1986 , a plane carrying arms to the Nicaraguan Contras was shot down by a 14-year-old Sandinista with a Soviet surface to air missile ( SAM ) .\nThe cargo kicker , a former Air America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) employee Eugene Hasenfus , was wearing a parachute and managed to jump out of the plane and parachute to the ground .\nHe was captured and began to talk , saying he was working for the CIA and naming \u201c Max Gomez \u201d and others working on the illegal contra resupply operation .\nMax Gomez turned out to be the notorious Felix Rodriguez , a drug dealing Cuban CIA man whose history went back to the Bay of Pigs invasion and who had helped capture and kill Che Guevara in Bolivia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a jar .\nHe had served in the Phoenix program in Vietnam under Vice President George H.W .\nBush \u2019 s National Security adviser Donald Gregg .\nPresident Ronald Reagan had personally ordered his National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane to find ways to circumvent the Boland Amendment and keep the Contras together \u201c Body and Soul \u201d .\nMcFarlane had put Oliver North in charge of the illegal Contra resupply operation .\nThe scandal went all the way to the top .\nLikewise by following the threads of the careers of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unravel a great deal of secret history .\nIn summer 1986 , Congress had ironically agreed to restore USD 100 million in lethal aid to the Contras .\nHence the Reagan Administration was desperate to cover up their blatant violation of the Boland amendment in case congress decided to change its mind .\nThere was a three-month delay before the funds became available so the illegal contra resupply operation had continued .\nElliot Abrams who had been supervising the whole illegal Contra resupply as the State Department representative on the Restricted Interagency Group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliver North and the CIA \u2019 s Alan Fiers .\nElliot Abrams was sent out to the Press and Congress to deny everything .\nAbrams was an expert in lies and denial .\nHis prior role had been Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights when he pretended that El Salvador and Guatemala were showing progress on human rights while they were still waging a campaign of mass murder and genocide .\nHis lies got honest reporters like Raymond Bonner reassigned for exposing massacres during the Central American dirty wars .\nOnce again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abrams categorical denials of any connection between the Reagan administration and the Contra resupply operation that Hasenfus exposed .\nGenerally the US media parrot the line put out by the US State Department , which is why a supposedly independent press are in practice government propagandists .\nJournalists may be interested in exposing the truth but their editors or producers prefer a cosy relationship with the national security state .\nThey all go to the same dinners and cocktail parties .\nLuckily before the Contra resupply story could be killed news of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Lebanese newspaper Al Shiras .\nOnce the Western press picked up on it , the story exploded .\nReagan had publicly called Iran murder incorporated .\nIts ally , Hezbollah in Lebanon , had bombed the US embassy killing a dozen CIA Middle East operatives ; kidnapped the CIA station chief William Buckley , then bombed the US Marine barracks killing 241 .\nIran had been officially labelled a terror sponsor by the US , which was waging an international campaign Operation Staunch to force its allies to stop selling arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Nicaragua which was in line with Reagan \u2019 s public rhetoric , the Iran arms deals had the potential to alienate Reagan \u2019 s right wing base .\nMoreover if the facts had been known and if there had been the political will , President Reagan could have been impeached or even sent to prison for violation of the Arms Export Control Act .\nAt first the Reagan administration tried its usual strategy of denial but it soon became clear that scapegoats and limited hangouts would be required .\nThe current Attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Reagan for decades , took charge of the cover-up .\nHe conducted a brief investigation .\nThen his aides discovered a memo from Oliver North on plans to divert funds from the Iran arms sales to the Contras .\nMeese checked with North , CIA director Bill Casey , and National Security Adviser Admiral John Poindexter who all agreed that they would shield Reagan by pretending he did not know about the diversion .\nIt became known as the \u201c Diversion Memo \u201d and Meese used it as a giant diversion from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales from Israel to Iran in the fall of 1985 .\nInstead the issue became did the President know about the diversion ?\n\u201c What did he know ?\nand When did he Know it ?\n\u201d was the media refrain echoing Watergate coverage .\nNorth was all to happy to play the political fall guy taking full responsibility although when criminal charges loomed he would later reveal that Reagan knew everything he was doing .\nBy then however the Press were again told to kill the story by their editors .\nRobert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North trial was not newsworthy .\nGeorge H.W .\nBush was now president thanks to the inability of the Press , the legislative and judicial branches to get to the bottom of the Iran-Contra scandal in which Bush was deeply implicated .\nReturning to late 1986 : President Reagan appointed the Tower Commission to confirm Meese \u2019 s version of events , creating the myth of a rogue National Security Council that Reagan had failed to properly supervise .\nThen the House and Senate held a circus-like joint investigation of the Iran-Contra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimed to embarrass rather then destroy Reagan .\nTheir strategy backfired when the telegenic Oliver North was embraced as a hero .\nThe Republicans however decided that the only crime had been Congress \u2019 passage of the Boland amendment and their attempt to meddle in the President \u2019 s control of foreign policy .\nThat was the view of future Vice President Dick Cheney who was then a House Rep. for Wyoming serving on the Iran-Contra committee .\nIn 2004 at the height of the war on terror he would cite the minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument for absolute executive power as a blueprint for the Bush Administration \u2019 s policies .\nThe price of this failed spectacle which catapulted North to stardom was Congress \u2019 grant of limited immunity to North and Poindexter for anything they might say .\nThis would later sabotage the criminal investigation of the Iran-Contra scandal .\nThe Christic Institute lawsuit was dismissed and they were forced to pay USD 1 million in damages .\nThe Kerry Committee investigated the Contra drug connection but the media ignored or mocked him .\nAn independent counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-year investigation would gradually unravel the true story of Iran-Contra .\nHowever with non-stop obstruction from the intelligence community and the Department of Justice , the court of appeals would overturn the convictions of North and Poindexter .\nFinally President George Bush , whose Iran-Contra role was becoming ever more exposed , decided to pardon a dozen Iran-Contra figures after loosing the 1992 election to Bill Clinton .\nClinton had been tied to CIA man Barry Seals while governor of Arkansas\u2014where much of the gunrunning and drug trafficking was staged .\nNeedless to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digging into Iran-Contra either .\nThe story was revived briefly by the heroic journalist Gary Webb .\nWebb \u2019 s career was destroyed .\nHis life ended with apparent suicide .\nIronically however thanks to his work the Contra drug connection , a part of the scandal many in the media and Congress wanted to suppress , is now the most well known aspect of the scandal .\nHaving laid out the basics of the scandal I will provide some historical background .\nEarly in the 19th the US had proclaimed the so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperialism in the Americas , it was in reality the US laying claim to the entire hemisphere .\nAs its power grew it began to enforce these claims with bribery , invasions and coups .\nIn the 19th century Nicaragua was embroiled in a civil war between the liberals and conservatives .\nWilliam Walker had attempted to conquer northern Mexico but failed .\nThe Nicaraguan Liberal party hired American mercenary William Walker and his \u201c Filibusters \u201d to intervene but he decided to seize power and institute slavery .\nHe ruled Nicaragua for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced out when Nicaragua \u2019 s neighbours invaded to expel him .\nHe died when he tried to invade and seize power again .\nShortly before World War I , the US had invaded and occupied Nicaragua for nearly 20 years .\nRevolutionary general Augusto Sandino would fight a guerrilla war in the attempt to expel them .\nNicaragua would become a laboratory for the use of air power in a counter-insurgency campaign .\nSandino was able to survive the bombs and the endless manhunt by US Marines , outsmarting US forces .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal he was assassinated .\nThe US had trained the Nicaraguan National Guard to carry out the dirty war against the Nicaraguan people .\nThey appointed their lackey Anastasio Somoza as its head .\nHe would soon seize power with his family ruling Nicaragua for decades until the 1979 Nicaraguan Revolution .\nSomoza would be a key backer of the coup to overthrow Jacobo Arbenz in nearby Guatemala in 1954 .\nThe coup in Guatemala would form a blueprint for the later , failed Bay of Pigs invasion and later the attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirty war on Nicaragua would be far more brutal and last far longer then the earlier campaigns .\nAfter the Cuban Revolution the US had spent two decades training the militaries in Latin American countries to wage dirty wars on their people .\nIn each country Intelligence agencies , the military , and the police waged a coordinated campaign of kidnapping torture and assassination .\nIn the Southern cone countries Operation Condor would unite the regimes in one vast dirty war on the continent .\nThis would occur in the wake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who overthrew elected president Salvador Allende in 1973 .\nThe roots went back to the beginnings of the Cold War and the chain of fascist coups that had started much earlier in Brazil in 1964 .\nBrazil , Chile , Argentina , Ecuador , Uruguay , Bolivia , and Paraguay were the first seven members of a network of countries that carried out a coordinated campaign of assassination , torture , and kidnapping .\nIn the 1970s this was increasingly combined with installing neoliberal shock therapy economic reforms in Chile and Argentina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even worse horrors as hundreds of thousands were killed in dirty wars in Guatemala , El Salvador and Nicaragua under Somoza .\nGuatemala \u2019 s campaign of terror had begun when a wave of military uprisings swept the country in protest over the training of Cuban exiles for the upcoming Bay of Pigs invasion in camps in Guatemala .\nBy the late 60s , it had evolved into a revolutionary armed struggle .\nThen Guatemala was flooded with CIA and Special Forces advisers to wage a scorched earth campaign to destroy the Guerrillas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massacre was conducted by the fascist dictator General Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez of Indians and suspected communists that killed 32,000 , the government had faced little opposition .\nThe US still sent in its advisers in the 1960s and by the 1970s their endless murder of political opponents and labour had forced the opposition to take up arms .\nIn Nicaragua a revolution had begun in the mid-1970s and Somoza had waged a brutal scorched earth campaign in an attempt to hold onto power .\nBut on 26 July 1979 , he was forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time since Cuba in 1959 , a revolution had succeeded in overthrowing a brutal US-backed dictator .\nThe Carter administration had cut off aid to Somoza because of his outrageous war crimes and refusal to negotiate with the opposition .\nSomoza turned to Israel for arms .\nIsrael was also playing key roles in the dirty wars in El Salvador and Guatemala providing arms and advisers , helping Guatemala carry out genocide against the Maya Indians .\nFive hundred of Somoza \u2019 s national guard , who had carried out numerous war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelter with the \u201c Godfather of the Death Squads \u201d Mario Sandoval Alarcon .\nThey were determined to follow the example of the Cuban exiles and wage covert war on revolutionary Nicaragua .\nSoon they were joined by Argentine advisers fresh from their own dirty war .\nThey arrived after having recently carried out the Bolivian cocaine coup and began to advise these Contras or counter-revolutionaries .\nThe Carter administration hoped to use aid as leverage to control Nicaragua \u2019 s new government .\nThe CIA was doubtless already backing the Contras , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began carrying out kidnappings , terrorism , and drug smuggling .\nReagan would be elected in part through illegal campaign donations from Central American oligarchs in Guatemala and El Salvador who had been promised full support in waging their dirty wars by former DIA director General Daniel Graham and General John Singlaub , a military/CIA man and future World Anti-Communist League head .\nReagan would keep this promise , vastly escalating the wars in Central America .\n300,000 would die in Guatemala and El Salvador in the name of preventing \u201c another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were standard operating procedures .\nLike in Nicaragua , the administration would lie to Congress to carry out the dirty wars in Guatemala and El Salvador and constantly find ways to circumvent any congressional limits to US support .\nThis never became a scandal .\nIn Nicaragua 35,000 would perish in attacks by the Contra death squads .\nCasey put Duane \u201c Dewey \u201d Clarridge in charge of Latin America and he ran the Contras until turning them over to Oliver North in the wake of Boland II .\nClarridge was transferred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would help arm the Contras and facilitate the Iran arms deals .\nTo summarize the Cold War history of the Middle East would be impossible in so short a space and would require months or years of extra research .\nThe US \u2019 s backing of Israel alienated the entire region .\nThe US scheme to create a Middle Eastern version of NATO and its constant coups to install pro-western regimes would backfire .\nIn Iran in 1953 the CIA overthrew prime minister Mossadegh and restored Shah Pahlavi .\nMossadegh , a fervent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communist for nationalizing the British owned Anglo-Iranian Oil Company ( British Petroleum ) .\nHe had expelled all the British spies and diplomats after their failed coup plots and attempt to lay siege to the country and prevent it from selling oil .\nThe British were forced to turn to the CIA and after the coup they turned over half of Iran \u2019 s oil over to US corporations .\nThe CIA and Mossad trained the Shah \u2019 s secret police , the Savak , to torture and murder their opponents .\nIran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military industrial complex .\nRichard Secord would serve as an air force adviser in the 1960s and then after serving in Vietnam and Laos return in the late 1970s as head of the US military assistance program .\nHe would meet various corrupt Iranian businessmen with intelligence ties that would later appear in the October surprise and Iran Contra scandals .\nThen he would supervise arms sales at the Pentagon .\nIn Egypt the CIA recruited Nasser \u2019 s successor Sadat .\nHe would sabotage the 1973 Arab Israeli war , expel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then convinced Sadat to completely betray the Arab cause by signing a separate peace deal with Israel .\nHis reward was a massive increase in weapons sales from the US .\nSecord at the Pentagon was a silent partner along with Ted Shackley in EATSCO , a transport company run by Ed Wilson and Thomas Clines , created to profit off the Egyptian arms sales .\nHowever Sadat \u2019 s peace deal was an obstacle to Israeli plans to invade Lebanon .\nHis security personnel were trained by American advisers connected to EATSCO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mubarak who was also a key figure in the Egyptian side of skimming money from the arms sales was installed as Egypt \u2019 s new leader .\nIn the late 1970s , Ed Wilson would be part of a scheme to supply huge amounts of C4 explosives and special forces advisers to Libya in order to gain intelligence on the revolutionaries and nationalists that Gaddafi allowed to train there and in the hopes of stealing Soviet weapons systems .\nWilson was carrying out an off the books operation for the CIA but they

decided to intervene in Ukraine .\nBack in December 2021 Russia asked NATO for security guarantees on Ukraine and reminded them that NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia was a red line .\nThe US and NATO refused to make any concessions .\nOn February 16 Ukraine began a massive escalation in shelling in Donetsk and Lugansk .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized the Donetsk and Lugansk People \u2019 s

Z.\n\u201d On February 24th 2022 Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine with 150,000 troops wreaking havoc with 160 cruise missiles on Ukraine \u2019 s air defenses , command and control , communications , supply depots and other targets .\nSuddenly Russian troops arrived in helicopters attempting to seize Kiev \u2019 s airport ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confusion Russian forces were seemingly everywhere .\nHowever it soon became clear that Russia had only established control on the perimeter of Ukraine \u2019 s North , South , East and West on a map it looks like a sideways U .\nInstead of racing to capture Kiev Russia is concentrating on controlling Ukraine \u2019 s southern coast .\nHowever they are close enough to Kiev to pin down Ukrainian forces .\nUkraine is stuck on the defensive and can \u2019 t counter attack or reinforce it \u2019 s troops .\nHowever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce resistance and so Russia \u2019 s day to day progress is slow .\nIt \u2019 s a pattern familiar to those who followed the earlier war in Ukraine or the war in Syria long periods of indecisive clashes followed by decisive victories and mop up operations .\nRussia has managed to take Kherson and restored Crimea \u2019 s supply of fresh water which Ukraine had cut off in revenge for it voting to rejoin Russia .\nCurrently Russia is focused on liberating the city of Mariupul which rose up in rebellion back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pro-Russian uprising and gave the city to the Azov battalion .\nFor 8 years they have terrorized the populace , running a secret prison at the local airbase where they kidnapped , tortured , raped , and murdered their victims .\nOnce Mariupul is liberated Russia may shift it \u2019 s attention to destroying the 120,000 Ukrainian troops occupying the Donbass who have massively increased their shelling and missile attacks on the civilian population there .\nIn the last 4 years the Ukrainian military and fascist paramilitaries have killed over 13,000 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the world remained silent .\nThat \u2019 s more 4 times the number of civilians that the west claim have been killed in the Russian invasion so far 2,500 .\nBoth sides conceal their own casualties and give exaggerated accounts of enemy casualties .\nHowever isn \u2019 t it interesting that the west claims Russia is exclusively targeting civilians and also claims that Russia has lost 12-15,000 troops .\nWhen has America ever had a lower civilian body count then the number of troops it has lost ?\nIn Iraq the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraqis were killed .\nAlso how many of those 2,500 civilians killed were killed by the Ukrainian military shelling of the Donbas ?\nhow many were killed by fascist paramilitaries ?\nHow many were killed as a result of Zelensky handing out 10,000 automatic weapons to drunken mobs in Kiev who have been using them to rob , loot , and execute suspected traitors .\nIn impotent rage fascist Ukrainians are targeting ethnic minorities like the Roma beating them and tying them to lampposts before posting pictures of their victims on social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaten for trying to get on the same buses or trains as white Ukrainians a brief scandal that was quickly hushed up .\nIf you \u201c Stand with Ukraine \u201d you are standing with fascism .\nThe west has rushed to condemn this as an unprovoked attack on a sovereign nation .\nAmerica the ultimate rogue state now poses as the champion of international law .\nHowever Russia \u2019 s attack was not unprovoked .\nThe war in Ukraine began in 2014 with the Maidan coup installing a fascist government .\nThe new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians and in response Crimea voted to rejoin Russia and the people of Donetsk and Lugansk declared their independence .\nUkraine then launched a major offensive to retake Lugansk and Donetsk .\nUkraine passed laws forbidding people to criticize Ukrainian Nazis or to praise the Soviet Union .\nHowever with Russia \u2019 s covert assistance the heroic people of Donetsk and Lugansk inflicted two crushing defeats on the Ukrainian armed forces and the Nazi paramilitary groups .\nUkraine was forced to sign a first and second Minsk agreement to end the war .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Minsk agreement which would have granted Donetsk and Lugansk autonomy while forcing them to remain part of Ukraine but neither Ukraine or the US ever honored it .\nInstead for 8 years Ukraine continued to shell the people of the Donbass and since 2018 have killed at least 13,000 people .\nAmerica and Ukraine started this war hopefully Russia will be able to end it .\nWhile condemning Russia the corporate media remain silent on the fact that the US is still illegally occupying Iraq and Syria , and is waging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Saudi proxies .\nIn the 30 years since the destruction of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war the US and often NATO 30 years have been destroying country after country Panama , Iraq , Yugoslavia , Rwanda , the Congo , Afghanistan , Iraq again , Libya , and Syria Yemen and Ukraine .\nIn Rwanda and Congo alone 7-13 million people died .\nThis is not even going into the coups and failed coups , the sanctions , the economic warfare and the billions who live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imperialism evolves over time and takes different forms .\nToday there is only one empire America and it \u2019 s network of allies countries like England , and France who \u2019 s empires plundered , massacred , and destroyed everywhere they went in Asia , Africa , and the Americas .\nAmerica \u2019 s empire absorbed fascist countries like Germany and Japan who between them slaughtered 50 million people Jews , Russians , Chinese , Roma and many more peoples .\nThe American empire absorbed the sinister old European empires , and the @ @

planet to believe in American benevolence .\nIt \u2019 s advertising created a worldwide consumer culture .\nIt \u2019 s music shaped teenage rebellion around the globe .\nOnly those who were the victims of American imperialism were able to see the monstrous empire for what it was .\nWhen the US recruited Reinhard Gehlen and hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) World War 2 they also absorbed Gehlen \u2019 s Ukrainian lackeys in the OUN .\nThe OUN began as a terrorist group after World War 1 assassinating Polish government officials .\nThey then formed an alliance with Nazi Germany the OUN provided recruits for the territorial police and the Waffen SS after Germany invaded the Soviet Union .\nThe OUN murdered millions of victims Jews , Poles , Ukrainians and Russians .\nThey loved to uses axes or saws to slaughter their victims in the goriest manner possible and to save bullets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first covert war in Ukraine back in the 1940 \u2019 s using these SS veterans Frank Wisner bragged that his guerrilla army of Ukrainian Nazis killed 30,000 people .\nUkraine was only one of many covert wars the US waged on the Soviet republics and the socialist eastern bloc countries .\nAlthough initially defeated in Ukraine the fascist emigres of the OUN would be supported by the US , the UK , and West Germany throughout the cold war and they dominated the umbrella group of former fascist collaborators from within the USSR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYaroslav Stetsko former Ukrainian ruler of the Nazi puppet state would spend the entire cold war demanding the US and NATO launch a nuclear war to destroy the Soviet Union .\nReagan and his Vice President Bush invited Stetsko to the White House for a photo op .\nToday thanks to the recklessness of the Biden administration Stestko \u2019 s apocalyptic dream of a nuclear war may yet come to pass .\nA hard core of Ukrainian fascists indoctrinated their children and their children \u2019 s children in the ideology of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids to Ukrainian fascist summer camps where they are indoctrinated in the OUN ideology .\nWhen the Soviet Union was destroyed by a combination of Gorbachev \u2019 s treachery and incompetence and a series of NED/CIA Color revolution style coups and destabilizations the OUN were able to return to Ukraine .\nColor Revolutions utilize NED and corporate foundations to build networks of NGO \u2019

\u2019 s propaganda campaign targeting the Soviet Union Radio Liberty \u2019 s Ukrainian broadcasts ( Radio liberty is half of RFE/RL ) .\nIn the 1990 \u2019 s with the help of the west the Ukrainian fascists began their campaign to revive fascism in Ukraine .\nLike in Russia the end of Socialism brought poverty and chaos .\nIn this chaos Ukrainian Nazi Paramilitaries began to prosper doing dirty work for various Ukrainian Oligarchs .\nIn 2004 the US would launch a \u201c Color Revolution \u201d the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro western government run by Viktor Yuschenko overturning the election victory of Viktor Yanukovych .\nThe new government began to glorify the Ukrainian Nazi collaborators .\nSoon discredited by it \u2019 s unchecked corruption Ukraine elected the also corrupt but neutral Yanukovych .\nIn early 2014 Yanukovych was overthrown by a much uglier color revolution in which the fascist paramilitary groups provided the muscle .\nIn hindsight it is clear that in overthrowing the deeply flawed Yanukovych the US destroyed any chance for an independent or democratic Ukraine .\nThe new government outlawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and allowed fascist paramilitary groups to terrorize anyone calling for moderation .\nThey banned Russian provoking a rebellion in Eastern Ukraine .\nMany in eastern Ukraine also rose up in opposition to the corrupt capitalist system in Ukraine .\nThen came the Odessa massacre when a mob of Ukrainian fascists chased a crowd of anti-war protestors ( protesting the impending civil war on ethnic Russians ) into a trade union building then setting it alight killing 39 people officially as many 150 unofficially .\nThe fascist Kiev regime celebrated openly while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they had burned themselves alive despite the whole horrific episode being captured on video .\nThe people of Donetsk and Lugansk realized that they were facing genocide and ethnic cleansing .\nThe war followed and thanks to the covert assistance of Russia , Donetsk and Lugansk were able to inflict two major humiliating defeats on the Ukrainian army .\nTheir strategy was to slowly encircle the Ukrainian forces trapping them in \u201c Cauldrons \u201d where surrounded by artillery and cut-off from resupply they were completely decimated .\nRussia , Donetsk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThus while western military experts are currently bragging about Ukraine \u2019 s success and Russia \u2019 s impending defeat eventually the Ukrainian forces will likely be encircled and destroyed .\nIt is the same strategy that the Soviet Union used to destroy the German army during WW2 .\nA major difference between the fighting now and in 2014-2015 ( or during World War 2 ) is that Russia now has air superiority and thus is slowly destroying Ukraine \u2019 s supplies of fuel and weapons .\nIt will be a long and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victorious .\nRussia must win this war it \u2019 s very survival is at stake .\nPutin has made a dangerous gamble but ultimately he had no choice .\nNATO and the US have turned Ukraine into a fascist puppet state that was never going to give up it \u2019 s dream of conquering the Donbass and eventually retaking Crimea .\nDespite being involved in an ongoing conflict with Russia , Ukraine had altered it \u2019 s constitution to permanently pursue NATO membership .\nAnd the Biden administration recklessly pushed to admit Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let Ukraine become a full NATO member some would argue .\nThis is equally insane they were willing to provoke a Russian invasion rather then assure Russia that Ukraine would not be admitted into NATO despite not actually planning to allow Ukraine to join .\nAnd despite Ukraine not being a NATO member NATO runs the Ukrainian army and holds massive war games in Ukraine where 20,000 NATO advisers train the Ukrainian Army and practice declaring nuclear war on Russia .\nPutin worried NATO planned to install intermediate range nuclear missiles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the invasion that Ukraine planned to start it \u2019 s own nuclear program .\nSince Ukraine already has the nuclear power plants and the technical know how from the soviet era the threat was very real .\nUkraine also hosts more then a dozen US biowarfare laboratories .\nRussia was faced with the choice of fighting a conventional war now or a nuclear war later .\nIf the west doesn \u2019 t come to it \u2019 s senses and insists on installing a No Fly Zone over Ukraine as Zelensky and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be destroyed in a nuclear apocalypse .\nWho is this President Zelensky who has become the idol of millions ?\nZelensky is a Eurovision winner turned comedian .\nHis patron is the oligarch Igor Kolmoisky who was also patron to the Nazi Right Sector prior to the Maidan coup .\nKolmoisky is jewish like Zelensky which didn \u2019 t stop him from hiring the Nazi right sector to act as muscle in the Ukrainian version of a \u201c hostile takeover \u201d where they acted as his private mercenaries seizing assets of his business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people claim that Ukraine can \u2019 t be a fascist country because it has a jewish president .\nIsrael has provided major funding and advisers to the Ukrainian Nazi Aidar Battalion alliances are often paradoxical .\nIsrael made it \u2019 s own secret deal with Gehlen at the start of the cold war .\nKolmoisky gave Zelensky a job playing an ordinary guy elected to the presidency on his TV channel and then Zelensky ran for the presidency on the peace platform and beat Petro Poroshenko .\nPoroshenko had won Ukraine \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Zelensky Poroshenko has gone on to ally himself with the hardcore nazis .\nHowever Ukraine was rapidly becoming a failed state and it \u2019 s western economic advisers had plunged the nation into poverty .\nZelensky \u2019 s popularity began to fall to 25 % .\nThe post-maidan version of the Yanukovych \u2019 s former party of regions now called the Opposition Party for life run by Viktor Medvechuk was gaining in popularity .\nLuckily for Zelensky and unluckily for Ukraine Biden had been elected and the new administration was determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump .\nTrump had been framed as a Russian agent but had sent arms to Ukraine that Obama had delayed .\nBiden as Vice President had been in charge of Ukraine .\nBiden appointed Victoria Nuland to the number three spot in the State Department Nuland had supervised the Maidan coup and had handpicked the new government .\nAnyways the Biden administration encouraged Zelensky to take a more hawkish turn .\nZelensky banned the opposition parties charging Medvechuk and Poroshenko for illegal deals with the Donbass and placing them under house arrest .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ He announced he would take back the Donbass .\nThis was back in 2021 .\nThis is why Putin began to move forces closer to Russia \u2019 s border with Ukraine both to pressure Zelensky and to respond to an attempt to take back the Donbass .\nRussia claims Ukraine planned to launch an attack on the Donbass in March 2022 .\nZelensky had already built up the already massive force stationed on the border of the separatist republics .\nWhen it appeared that Russia would back down Ukraine launched a massive artillery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize the republics .\nNow Zelensky \u2019 s star continues to rise he \u2019 s been given the role of the lifetime and he shouts his heroic defiance from in front of a green screen knowing that the Ukrainian people will be forced to pay the price .\nIf Ukraine looses the war he \u2019 ll go on a world tour before settling down to a luxurious retirement as head of the government in exile .\nOn the other hand if he tries to surrender he may be killed or overthrown by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recently Zelensky banned 11 more opposition parties and seized all private media putting it under state control .\nSo far Biden has shown enough restraint to avoid a nuclear war .\nInstead he \u2019 s decided to nuke the global economy with his sanctions on Russia .\nThese sanctions have sent food and energy costs skyrocketing and will cause untold misery and chaos worldwide .\nFor the first time Americans themselves will suffer from the sanctions it so heartlessly puts on other countries .\nThe global economy is already in tatters due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID epidemic .\nEurope will be even harder hit while the third world will suffer starvation and death .\nIronically by sending energy prices soaring the sanctions will help Russia survive the economic embargo the west has launched on their country .\nRussia is now the most heavily sanctioned country on the planet surpassing North Korea and Iran .\nMore sanctions are on the way .\nThe US is destroying one of the key tools it uses to control the world the petrodollar .\nBiden \u2019 s disastrous strategy is pressing the fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the US empire .\nMeanwhile ordinary people will pay the price .\nThe media is of course blaming the Russian invasion rather then sanctions for the price hikes .\nReturning to the war it is certain to be a long and bloody war .\nYet while the western media cry crocodile tears for Ukraine , America and it \u2019 s allies are doing all they can to insure that the war leaves Ukraine in complete ruin .\nNATO hopes that as many Ukrainian civilians die as possible so that it can terrify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia for years to come .\nIn fact they are so full of hubris that they are already boasting of what they call their \u201c Afghanistan Option \u201d and their plans to set up a Ukrainian GLADIO in the event of a Russian victory .\nHillary Clinton has been given the job of publicly promoting the Afghanistan option and promising that the war will be as long and bloody as possible to bleed Russia .\nThe fact that Ukraine like Afghanistan could suffer decades of war poverty and chaos in the aftermath does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brag that they are setting up a stay behind network that will continue to launch terror attacks and create an insurgency that will continue long after the Russian victory .\nThe strategy for now could more accurately be called \u201c Plan Syria.\n\u201d Ukrainian forces are preventing civilians from evacuating their cities so that they will die in the crossfire .\nThey are stationing their military equipment in vital civilian infrastructure like hospitals , schools , and shopping malls then firing on Russian forces from these positions .\nWhen Russia fires back they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or school ( schools are thankfully empty at the moment ) .\nIn Syria it was the same story the terrorists turned hospitals into military bases and secret prisons .\nWhile the western press repeatedly claimed that Assad had destroyed \u201c The last Hospital in Syria \u201d Often Ukrainian forces , abandon fortifications outside of the city and move their military into civilian areas .\nThere have been numerous reports of the Ukrainian military massacring civilians who try to flee the warzone .\nThey plan to turn Kiev into a hellhole of urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to untrained volunteers who will get themselves slaughtered .\nThe reappearance of the same tactics used in Syria in the war in Ukraine reveals that NATO , the CIA , and western intelligence masterminded the Syrian terrorists criminal strategy all along and now they are giving the same disastrous advice to Ukraine .\nSyria meanwhile is suffering from the \u201c Gaza option \u201d harsh sanctions prevent Syria from rebuilding while the west is deliberately trying to starve the population into submission .\nIn the case of Ukraine luckily the Russian military is already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed to wreck Syria .\nThe west has also rushed thousands of fascists , mercenaries , and veterans to fight in the war in Ukraine however this strategy backfired when Russia fired a missile on March 13 , 2022 at their training camp near Lviv the International Peace Keeping and Security Center.\n\u201d killing 35 and sending the rest into a panic some of the survivors took to social media warning everyone not to come to Ukraine to die as canon fodder .\nThe west has also been funneling billions in arms to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow up with more missiles .\nRussian , Donetsk , and Lugansk ground forces have also seized huge stockpiles of American weapons .\nEvery day another Ukrainian arms stockpile , logistics hub , or military barracks is destroyed by Russian air power .\nShort of starting a nuclear war by trying to enforce a No-Fly zone their is little the US and NATO can do to negate Russia \u2019 s advantage in the air .\nStill Russia will probably have to expand the size of their ground force if it wants to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s goal to denazify and demilitarize Ukraine .\nIf Russia wins two main scenarios are possible .\nEither the US will have Zelensky sign a peace deal and Ukraine will be divided into a pro-western part and a Russian controlled part .\nIf the US refuses to make a deal Russia will takeover the entire country and install a pro-Russian government .\nUkraine and Belarus will then become Russia \u2019 s buffer to the west .\nAt this point there is no way to predict how long the war will last it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd even if Russia gains a victory it will face a NATO supplied Ukrainian insurgency for years after that .\nThanks to the Maidan coup Ukraine has

help of the CIA and other NATO countries intelligence agencies are willing to carry out daring attacks on Russian targets .\nSupplied with US intelligence Ukraine was able to sink the Moskva most likely with a missile and drones .\nThankfully most of the crew survived but it was a major blow to Russian morale .\nThe US is planning on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly brags about the role it played in the attack on the Moskva the sort of dangerous games that could lead to a nuclear war .\nUsing helicopters and drones Ukraine was able to blow up fuel storage tankers within Russia itself .\nMore recently however Russia has been successfully preventing these helicopter and drone attacks although Ukrainian saboteurs are probably still operating in Russia .\nUkraine has also been firing artillery across the border shelling Russian civilians and a number of mysterious fires have been breaking out at sites related to Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine also continues to target civilians in Donetsk and Lugansk firing artillery and rockets packed with cluster munitions at civilian targets .\nOnly when the battle of the Donbass is won will the people of Donetsk and Lugansk finally see an end to the nearly decade of hell they have suffered at the hands of the Ukrainian military .\nSome of these daring Ukrainian attacks however have bordered on the pointless and suicidal like the ill fated attempt to retake snake island in time to ruin Moscow \u2019 s victory day parade .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraines snake island defenders had told the Russians to \u201c fuck off \u201d and then heroically fought to the last man .\nIn reality they surrendered but Ukrainians prefer the legend to the reality .\nZelensky personally ordered a series of raids to retake the island .\nInstead of scoring a symbolic victory Ukrainian forces and their NATO advisers were slaughtered trying to take the island .\nNear Kharkov Ukrainian forces launched a counter attack Russian forces withdrew to avoid them and Ukraine moved their small force up to the Russian border .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ battalion terrorized the locals who might be kidnapped or killed if they had accepted humanitarian aid from Russia .\nUkraine already controls a large stretch of it \u2019 s border with Russia that so their offensive was pointless except as a means to distract Russia from advancing in the Donbass .\nHowever the media played up the episode as if Ukraine was now ready to advance to the gates of Moscow in a transparent attempt to distract the world \u2019 s attention from the impending disaster Ukraine was facing in the Donbass .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare with it \u2019 s CIA advisers , it \u2019 s western PR firms , and the decades of training in media warfare that Ukrainians have received from the US NED .\nThe NED is the National Endowment For Democracy the CIA front that manipulates elections , turns foreign political parties into American puppets , and stages coups and color revolutions .\nThe NED has funded NGO \u2019 s to train Ukrainian \u2019 s in journalism and social media activism for over 20 years .\nThus Ukraine excels at propaganda .\nEven if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t matter however as the corporate media unquestioningly repeat whatever claims Ukrainian government officials make while dismissing anything the Russians say .\nMainstream media dishonesty already terrible to begin with , has reached a new low in Ukraine .\nThis has provided fertile ground for false flag attacks and other forms of black propaganda .\nFor example when Russian forces abandoned the siege of Kiev and withdrew Ukrainian forces staged the Bucha massacre in their wake .\nUkrainian forces slaughtered a bunch of civilians they suspected of being traitors and then blamed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to debunk the Bucha massacre Ukraine fired a missile at the Kramatorsk railway station and again blamed Russia .\nNext President Biden and US intelligence basically invited Ukraine to stage a chemical weapons attack and to blame Russia falsely claiming that they had intelligence a Russian chemical attack was imminent .\nBiden warned that any such attack would be a red line that could provoke direct US involvement .\nThe administration later admitting they made the whole thing up .\nThere is a danger that the whole world could be dragged into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical , nuclear or biological attack in Ukraine .\nThe whole world would be turned to atomic ash before the truth could ever be exposed .\nThankfully it is doubtful if the US want to get directly involved in Ukraine in a conventional war with Russia where both sides would suffer heavy casualties let alone a nuclear war in which the world would be destroyed .\nStill with America fighting a proxy war with Russia while busily provoking a war with China it would be unwise to underestimate the insanity of the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setbacks and Ukraine and the US are winning the propaganda war .\nHowever propaganda can only carry you so far before the realities on the battlefield expose your claims as absurd lies .\nThe western triumphalist narrative on Ukraine is about to come crashing down at least temporarily .\nRussia is winning the battle of the Donbass .\nThis is a simplified account as the fighting covers dozens of tiny villages with long names that can be spelled completely differently depending on which system of transliteration you use , or whether it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow the war closely you need to follow the action daily on the various war maps available on social media via various amateur military analysts .\nFirst Russia launched an offensive out of Izyum .\nUkraine kept poring forces into the meat grinder to stop the slow Russian advance .\nUkrainian forces put up fierce resistance but the Russians are using the tactic of relying on their artillery and rockets to soften up targets for weeks and months before sending forces in with probing attacks .\nIf they are repelled then Russian forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map it may look like Russian forces were making no progress but Ukraine was suffering heavy casualties and their morale is plummeting .\nIn Popasnaya Russia pursued the same strategy .\nPopasnaya was a cornerstone of Ukraine \u2019 s defenses in Lugansk fighting to take the town lasted months .\nHowever once it fell Ukraine \u2019 s defenses began to collapse .\nRussia massed forces in the town which commands the heights and is advancing in multiple directions out of Popasnaya .\nSo far Russian successes have mostly been in the North of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being encircled in Severodonetsk , are close to being encircled in Lisichansk , and are in danger of being encircled in Avdeevka .\nUkraine has abandoned it \u2019 s stronghold Svetlodarsk Donetsk .\nRussia has captured the town of Lyman another major part of Ukraine \u2019 s defensive lines .\nCurrently things are moving so fast that this article will be outdated before it can appear .\nInitially Russia \u2019 s victories were in the North of Donbass in Lugansk but now they are also making progress in the South in Donetsk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s attention after capturing or destroying Ukrainian forces in Lugansk .\nA key symbolic victory will be the liberation of Slavyansk which was once the heart of the rebellion against the Maidan coup but the rebels were forced to abandon the town rather then be encircled .\nThe defense of Slavyansk had given Donetsk and Lugansk time to prepare their defenses and inspired thousands of volunteers to join the struggle .\nSlavyansk \u2019 s battle hardened defenders would form the backbone of the Donetsk and Lugansk forces .\nUkraine has transformed Slavyansk into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer then expected in this war so there is no telling how long the battle for the Donbass will last but clearly things are not going well for Ukraine .\nIf Russia wins the battle for the Donbass the west may decide to let Ukraine negotiate rather then risk losing the rest of Ukraine .\nIf Ukraine won \u2019 t make a deal after losing Russia may decide to take the rest of Ukraine \u2019 s coastline taking Nikolaev and Odessa preventing Ukraine from firing more missiles at Russia \u2019 s black sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 would include Dnipetrovesk where Ukraine is already desperately trying to build up their defenses in central Ukraine or the city of Kharkov in the North .\nBack in 2014 Kharkov was to have been the capital of Novorossiya but Ukraine crushed the rebellion there and turned the city into it \u2019 s main base for the war on Donbass .\nIt will be difficult to capture as it was designed in Soviet times to resist a full scale NATO invasion .\nIronically this is another reason the war is taking so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War 2 the Soviets rebuilt the entire country to resist a western invasion and even a nuclear war adopting a strategy of fortress cities .\nIn places like Azovstal Soviet construction has proven more effective then the latest defective American weapons sent to Ukraine like the Javelin anti-tank missile .\nNow to turn to the economic war against Russia which predictably has turned into a major disaster for the west .\nEnergy prices are skyrocketing , food prices are rising and there are shortages in the west .\nMeanwhile Russia is forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rubles .\nAs the US knows full well skyrocketing energy prices benefit the Russian economy .\nBut perhaps there is method to this madness and the true target of this economic war are America \u2019 s \u201c allies \u201d in Europe and Asia .\nPresident Biden has pretty much destroyed the global economy and people are beginning to naively wonder why the US is sending 40 billion to Ukraine while there is a shortage of infant formula .\nNaive in that the US always has money for weapons and never has money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact spent trillions in the cold war to keep the rest of the planet poor .\nActually much of the 40 billion is actually going to the US military industrial complex to replace all the weapons the US and it \u2019 s allies have already sent .\nAnother huge chunk is going to NATO .\nUkraine with it \u2019 s economy in tatters due to the neo-liberal reforms imposed after the 2014 coup is expected to pay back the 40 billion .\nI \u2019 ve been reading a lot about Ukraine recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Chris Kaspar de Ploeg which I definitely recommend .\nWith \u201c Bidenomics \u201d destroying the global economy it \u2019 s a good time to revisit the now mostly forgotten role of then Vice President Joe Biden played in Ukraine .\nIn other words some of the scandalous details of \u201c Ukrainegate \u201d Joe Biden played a key role in events in Ukraine he spent more then 2-3 hours a week on the phone with then President Poroshenko who was waging a brutal war on the Donbass that would kill at least 14,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s refusal to implement the Minsk protocols .\nBiden joked that he spoke to Poroshenko \u201c more then my wife \u201d Biden was the main proponent of \u201c Ukrainian energy independence \u201d which translates into a scheme for Ukraine to start fracking oil and natural gas .\nThe main beneficiary was Igor Kolmoisky who gratefully put Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma holdings along with John Kerry \u2019 s former chief of staff David Leiter and Kerry \u2019 s former adviser Devon Archer .\nThis is the same Igor Kolmoisky who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nKolmoisky was also the patron of the Neo-Nazi Dmitry Yarosh and what would become Right Sector and a key funder of the Azov Battalion .\nThanks to the 2014 coup Komoisky was able to steal billions of dollars .\nHe laundered the money in the US buying and looting American factories and putting the American workers out of work .\nHis protege Zelensky also stole nearly half a billion dollars and moved it offshore a fact exposed in the Panama papers and the western press but since conveniently forgotten along with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Azov battalion .\nLets connect the dots Joe Biden and Hunter Biden connect with Igor Kolmoisky who connects with Zelensky and the Azov battalion .\nJoe Biden also had the corrupt Natalie Jaresko named Ukraine \u2019 s finance minister .\nA US citizen who illegally became a dual Ukrainian citizen .\nBefore becoming Finance Minister she had mismanaged a USAID investment scheme WNISEF meant to \u201c foster investment \u201d in Moldova and Ukraine .\nHer salary was capped at $ 150,000 but she managed to pay herself millions while managing an investment portfolio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scandal exposed by the late Robert Parry .\nJoe Biden also backed the appointment of Yuriy Lutsenko as Ukraine \u2019 s prosecutor general despite him lacking any legal experience .\nLutsenko then had two officials at NABU ( Ukraine \u2019 s National Anti-Corruption Bureau ) arrested and beaten and cut off NABU \u2019 s access to the criminal database .\nTo summarize Biden was blatantly corrupt , openly encouraged corruption , and supported a crackdown on Ukraine \u2019 s pathetic attempt to rein in corruption .\nWhile Biden \u2019 s family and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden was pushing hard for Ukraine to adopt austerity policies that would decimate Ukrainians already low standard of living creating untold misery .\nNow Biden is imposing neo-liberal shock therapy on the entire planet creating runaway inflation and an economic depression at the same time .\nDoubtless Biden is merely serving the interests of the ultra-rich who by impoverishing the planet hope to widen their profit margins .\nThe economic disaster is already dampening the obnoxious Ukraine-mania fad that swept the west at the start of the war .\nRussia \u2019 s impending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donbass will destroy the fantasy that Ukraine can be used to destroy Russia .\nUnfortunately the war will most likely continue and the west will continue to flood Ukraine with weapons , advisers , intelligence officers .\nRussia is ready for a long war and has been holding most of it \u2019 s forces in reserve .\nHopefully the American empire will suffer a disastrous defeat in Ukraine and the country will be fully denazified and demilitarized .\nMy earlier article on the Russia-Ukraine War", "author": "Hugo Turner (noreply@blogger.com)", "url": "http://anti-imperialist-u.blogspot.com/2022/05/the-battle-for-donbass.html",

.\nPart two will cover the horrific war crimes the OUN carried out during the war .\nIn part one I will be relying mostly on the definitive \u201c Stepan Bandera The Life and Afterlife of a Ukrainian Nationalist : Fascism , Genocide , and Cult \u201d by Grzegorz Rossolinski-Liebe , which I recommend to anyone looking to do an in-depth study of the history of the OUN .\nThe early Ukrainian nationalists were socialist leaning moderates .\nThey were poets , romantics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasants and Cossacks and their unique Russian dialect , which was also spoken in Southern Russia .\nThe name Ukraine simply meant borderland and its people were known as Malorussians , which meant \u201c little Russians \u201d .\nYet as the craze for nationalism swept Europe some intellectuals began to think of Ukraine as a separate nation .\nOf these the main influence on the later fascist Ukrainian nationalists was the historian Mykhailo Hrushev \u2019 sky his monumental history of Ukraine portrayed Ukrainians as a completely separate race from Poles or Russians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closely interlinked Russia and Ukraine .\nRussians traced their origins to the Kievan Russ ( centred in modern day Kiev , Ukraine ) and viewed Ukrainians and Byelorussians as close cousins to the Russians .\nMany Ukrainians viewed themselves as Russians .\nAlso many Russians moved to Ukraine during the 18th and 19th centuries .\nEven today most Ukrainians speak Russian .\nThe Russian empire encouraged this merging of the two identities and tried to discourage the use of Ukrainian .\nHrushevs \u2019 ky \u2019 s work would inspire another far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mykola Mikhnovs \u2019 kyi , who would preach a worldview that saw a Ukrainian race surrounded by enemies that needed to be eliminated .\nHe inserted 19th century Social Darwinism and scientific racism into Ukrainian nationalism , writing in the majority Russian city of Kharkov .\nHe labelled \u201c Russians , Poles , Magyars , Romanians and Jews as enemies of Ukraine \u201d ( as long as they ruled or exploited Ukrainians ) and hoped to create a Ukrainian state stretching from the Caucuses to the Carpathian Mountains .\nHis Ten Commandments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded in 1904 would be a major influence on the OUN .\nIt included such memorable lines as \u201c Do not marry a foreign woman because your children will become your enemies.\n\u201d Elsewhere Mikhnovs \u2019 kyi wrote \u201c Ukraine for Ukrainians , and as long as even one alien enemy remains on our territory , we are not allowed to lay down our arms.\n\u201d 80 % of Ukrainians lived within the Russian empire .\nThe other 20 % lived in an area that had once been controlled by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased to exist in the late 18th century , were ruled by the Austro-Hungarian Empire .\nThey were known as Ruthenians and their language was closer to Polish than to the dialect spoken in Russian Ukraine .\nThe Austro-Hungarian Empire encouraged extreme Ukrainian nationalism seeing Ukrainians as a vital counterbalance to the rebellious Poles .\nThe area the Ukrainians or Ruthenians lived in was known as Eastern Galicia .\nThis was the situation when Stepan Bandera was born in 1909 .\nThe OUN had its origins entirely in this western controlled part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War 1 and the Russian Civil War this territory would be controlled by a reborn Poland once again in the form of Poland \u2019 s Second Republic .\nThe Second Republic also included the Western Ukrainians in Volhnyia part of Russian Ukraine conquered in its war against the Soviets .\nOver the centuries Ukrainian aristocrats in Poland had decided to assimilate and become Polish nobles .\nThus most of the Ukrainians were peasants .\nPoland also encouraged the creation of the Greek Catholic Church , which continued to follow the Orthodox Christian rite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Orthodox Patriarch .\nBy Bandera \u2019 s time the Greek Catholic Church was an important element of Western Ukrainian identity and many OUN leaders like Stepan Bandera were the children of Greek Catholic priests , who were also hard-core Ukrainian nationalists .\nWhile swearing loyalty to the Polish state the Greek Catholic Church would enrage the Polish government by acting to support the OUN ringing church bells when OUN members were executed , or as a warning when police were on the way to disrupt Ukrainian nationalist events and holding memorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c heroes of Ukraine \u201d .\nThey were adopted as nationalist martyrs in the OUN cult .\nUkrainians in western Ukraine were mostly peasants ( until 1848 they were serfs ) working for Polish landlords and their Jewish managers .\nWest Ukraine thus gave birth to a nationalism that was full of hatred for Jews and Poles .\nThe OUN would target both for extermination .\nThe OUN would combine traditional Ukrainian anti-Semitism with Nazi \u201c racial science.\n\u201d However Poland was an authoritarian military dictatorship .\nThis was another major influence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dmytro Dontsov found it much safer to vilify the Russians and the Soviet Union who were enemies of Poland then to risk the wrath of the Polish state .\nDontsov was a former Marxist who argued that Ukrainian nationalism should purge itself of all elements of socialism or democracy both of which he blamed for the failure to establish a Ukrainian state .\nBy 1922 Dontsov had found his model in Mussolini \u2019 s fascist Italy .\nHe was even more impressed by Hitler and the Nazis .\nDontsov translated these fascist thinkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introductions for fawning biographies glorifying Mussolini and Hitler .\nHe popularized fascism , anti-Semitism and Russophobia among the students of Bandera \u2019 s generation .\nHis vulgarized version of the philosophy of Nietzsche , Fichte , and Rousseau argued that Ukrainians must cast aside conventional morality and be willing to commit any crime if it meant the birth of a Ukrainian state .\nDontsov praised fanaticism as a virtue .\nHowever he resisted numerous invitations to join the OUN for fear of being arrested by the Polish government .\nHaving introduced some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascism , let us go back in time to World War 1 and the Russian Revolution to introduce the historical origins of the OUN .\nThe OUN were made up of two generations .\nThe older generation had fought on the side of the Austro-Hungarian Empire during World War 1 .\nSome formed the Sich Riflemen , which included future OUN leader Levhen Konovalets .\nThey were from Western Ukraine .\nDuring World War 1 , Galicia would be a battleground between Russia and the Austrian and German forces .\nRussia captured Galicia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhen in 1917 , the February Revolution overthrew the Tsar and installed a mildly left wing \u201c democracy \u201d ruled by Kerensky , Ukrainian Nationalists in Russian Ukraine created a Rada and declared their autonomy within the Russian Empire .\nIt was headed by the left wing Vinnichenko as Prime Minister .\nLater that year the October Revolution overthrew the Kerensky government in Russia .\nThe Rada decided to take advantage of the chaos and declare a Ukrainian People \u2019 s Republic ( UNR ) on 20 November 1917 .\nThe head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would become infamous for his mass murders of Jews during the civil war , killing 50-60,000 of them .\nThe OUN would adopt him as a hero of Ukraine .\nIn 1926 Petlura would be assassinated by a Jewish survivor who had lost his family , anarchist Sholom Schwartz .\nExposing the horrific crimes of Petliura \u2019 s forces at the trial Schwartz was declared not guilty by the sympathetic jury .\nToday Petliura has once again been declared a hero of Ukraine .\nThe Soviets were desperate to end the war with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be known as the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk .\nThe Ukrainian People \u2019 s Republic had sent envoys to the negotiations and the Germans and Austrians recognized their claims , as did the Soviet negotiators .\nThe Soviet Union was also backing a self-proclaimed Soviet Ukrainian republic .\nWhen this Soviet Ukraine sent envoys the Germans refused to let them participate .\nTensions were rising between the Soviets and the Ukrainian People \u2019 s Republic or UNR .\nThe UNR were allowing the white Russian army ( the Counter-Revolutionaries ) , led by General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Cossacks , lead by Hetman Kaledin , to operate on their territory while disarming Red Army troops and forces loyal to the Ukrainian Soviets and urging Ukrainian troops serving in the Red Army to return to Ukraine .\nOn 15 December 1917 the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed giving Germany and Austria control of huge swaths of Russian territory in exchange for peace .\nFreed from the German threat on 17 December 1917 , the Soviet Government sent the Ukrainian People \u2019 s Republic an ultimatum demanding that the UNR cease shielding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and blocking the passage of the Red Army .\nBritish and French envoys promised to aid the Rada if it resisted the Soviet ultimatum .\nThe Soviets were backing Ukrainian communists attempt to set up a communist parallel government in Kharkov while officially recognizing the Ukrainian People \u2019 s Republic .\nThe detail is too complicated to discuss here .\nHowever Ukraine became a battleground between the Red Army , the Germans , the Polish , and the white Russian counter-revolutionary forces .\nAlso fighting were the West Ukrainian army , Petlura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ukrainian Anarchist Makhno , and various bandit warlords and Cossacks .\nKiev would change hands more then a dozen times .\nInitially the Ukrainian People \u2019 s Republic rejected the Soviet ultimatum to allow the Red Army to pass through to attack the white forces .\nHowever war was avoided for a couple months .\nSoon the Red Army was occupying Kiev as the Rada lacked popular support .\nPeople wanted land reform not Ukrainization , something viewed as annoyance by many Russian speakers .\nThe Rada forces had deserted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control Kiev for only three weeks .\nThe Rada turned to the Germany and Austria who recognized the UNR .\nThe Germans invaded Ukraine forcing the Red army to withdraw .\nSymon Petliura \u2019 s forces took power .\nIn April 1918 , the Germans disbanded the Rada and installed a puppet Government under Hetman Skorpadsky .\nGermany was under an economic blockade with its people facing starvation .\nThe Germans proceeded to loot Ukraine \u2019 s grain , angering the peasants .\nIn November 1918 the German military collapsed and they abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petliura and the new Rada government called \u201c The Directorate \u201d seized power in Kiev yet again before being forced out by the Red Army .\nAs Petliura \u2019 s forces retreated they carried out massive pogroms against the Jews .\nPetliura \u2019 s forces often dressed up as communist forces to carry out these Pogroms murdering the communist sympathizers who came to greet them first , and then spending days robbing , raping , and murdering the rest of the Jews .\nWith Germany out of the war , Britain and France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloodthirsty white General Denikin in his attempt to destroy the Soviet Union .\nIronically Denikin was a Russian nationalist who viewed Ukraine as inseparable from Russia .\nDenikin \u2019 s forces carried out equally horrific pogroms .\nPetliura allied with Denikin and then with Poland .\nIn western Ukraine they declared their own Ukrainian republic the ZUNR on 1 November 1918 in Lvov .\nThe backbone of its military ( the UHA ) was veterans of the Sich Rifleman .\nAt the same time Poland proclaimed the independent Second Republic The war began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battled for control of the city .\nA Polish Ukrainian war began for control of Galicia .\nPoland eventually would crush and absorb the West Ukrainian republic .\nThe ZUNR leaders would go into exile and form the UVO .\nIronically many of the men from its army would desert to the Red Army .\nThis was because the Red Army was waging war against Poland and the Ukrainian People \u2019 s Republic ( in Russian Ukraine ) , which had signed a deal with Poland surrendering Polish control of Western Ukraine .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ war in Ukraine would need its own article or book to do it justice .\nHowever there are a couple of lessons that can be learned .\nUkrainian nationalists were happy to become tools of foreign powers while supposedly seeking independence .\nUkrainian nationalists were willing to see their country exploited economically by foreign powers .\nUkrainization had little appeal in Russian Ukraine .\nThe Soviets won because the Ukrainian people were more concerned with their economic situation .\nAlthough briefly united by treaty on 22 January 1919 , the Western Ukrainian ZUNR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter enemies .\nIronically the OUN , with their dreams of genocide , still considered the mass murderer Petliura a hero although he had sold out to Poland , recognising the Polish claim to eastern Galicia in exchange for Polish support .\nTen years after Petliura \u2019 s assassination , the OUN issued a pamphlet urging Ukrainians to beat or kill a Jew to avenge Petliura .\nFinally the Polish-Soviet War ended on 18 March 1921 .\nPoland and the Soviet Union signed the Treaty of Riga awarding Poland control over Eastern Galicia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nUkrainians were Poland \u2019 s largest minority making up 16 % of the population .\nIn Galicia , which the OUN would plot to turn into a Ukrainian state , the population was 47 % Polish , 42 % Ukrainian and 11 % Jewish .\nIn Eastern Galicia , Ukrainians comprised 62 % of the population along , with 25 % Poles and 12 % Jews .\nThe rest of Ukraine became a Soviet republic within the USSR with 26 Million Ukrainians ( or Russians ) living there .\nAround 500,000 Ukrainians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romania .\nCzechoslovakia was supportive of Ukrainian nationalism allowing Ukrainian schools and universities .\nUkraine was home to many other ethnic groups including Hungarians , Romanians , and Germans .\nAfter the civil war ended , Soviet Ukraine was relatively stable .\nDuring the 1920s , the NEP ( New Economic Policy ) , a rollback of socialism , favoured the peasants .\nLenin gave the Soviet republic of Ukraine a huge swath of Russian territory along the Black Sea coast called Novorossiya along with the industrial areas of Donetsk and Lugansk .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemned by Russian nationalists for the decision ; one Russia appears intent on reversing in the current war .\nLenin strongly promoted Ukrainization , forcing government officials to learn Ukrainian and building Ukrainian schools and universities .\nIn 1923 the Soviets even convinced the nationalist Ukrainian historian Hrushevs \u2019 kyi to serve in the new government as head of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences .\nIn the 1930s , collectivization would lead to a famine and a low level civil war throughout the Soviet Union including Ukraine .\nWestern historians love to demonize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that it was collectivization that finally ended the periodic famines that had rocked Russia for centuries .\nCollectivization was necessary in order for the Soviet Union to industrialize and establish the military strength it would need to resist the coming genocidal German invasion .\nThe OUN diaspora has mythologized the famine during collectivization as an attempted genocide \u201c The Holodomor \u201d and used it to justify their horrific crimes during World War 2 .\nThe OUN claim that the famine was deliberately engineered to wipe out Ukrainians .\nThis ignores the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard hit .\nMoreover it overlooks the role of grain speculation and export of masses of grain to the West by Ukrainian merchants , offered high prices by Western buyers .\nThe famine was the result of bad weather and economic warfare waged by the West .\nMainstream historians , especially in the English language literature , continue to promote the view that the economic troubles in the Soviet Union and their consequences were always and entirely of the government \u2019 s own making .\nToday the OUN justify their crimes by vilifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no presence in Soviet Ukraine and operated only in Poland and from exile in Europe .\nIt was only after the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 , when the Soviets would occupy Western Ukraine as part of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact , was Ukraine briefly united .\nThe Soviets would launch a crackdown on the OUN , a fascist terrorist group spying for Nazi Germany , arresting thousands of suspected members and executing hundreds .\nThis would continue until the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic that the OUN would have its origins .\nIn 1920 the veterans of the Sich Riflemen who had fought for the ZUNR in western Ukraine founded the UVO an underground terrorist army .\nUVO stood for Ukrainian Military Organization in Ukrainian .\nIts founders were Levhen Konavalets , Andrii Melnyk and Roman Sushko .\nKonavalets would head the UVO and later the OUN until his death .\nMelnyk would head the OUN after Konavalets .\nThe UVO was not a mass political organization but instead a terrorist group that funded itself by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intelligence ) .\nInitially the main political party of the Ukrainian nationalists were the UNDO who sought to win independence through legal and democratic means and initially were opposed to fascism and terrorism .\nBy the 1930s however , the right wing of UNDO secretly worked closely with the OUN .\nThe UVO founded the OUN the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists at the 1st Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists in Vienna held between 28 January and 3 February 1929 .\nThe OUN were to be a mass political organization recruited from Ukrainian nationalist youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The OUN were to indoctrinate the public and wage a terror war against the Polish authorities .\nThe older generation of OUN leaders in exile formed the PUN while young recruits like Stepan Bandera worked for the Homeland Executive back in Poland .\nThe PUN tried and failed to unite all Ukrainian political parties but they did manage to infiltrate and gain control of many Ukrainian youth groups .\nThe younger generation of OUN were even more radical then their elders and their elders were openly fascist .\nThe younger generation had joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at age 15 graduated to groups for teenagers .\nAs teenagers they had devoured the works of Dontsov and other fascists .\nThe younger generation included names that would later become infamous for their crimes like Stepan Bandera , Yaroslav Stetsko , and Roman Shukhevych .\nAt the beginning of the 1930s , the younger generation of OUN were highly motivated , fanatical , reckless youth .\nHistorians call them the \u201c Bandera Generation.\n\u201d Stepan Bandera was born on 1 January 1909 to Andrii and Myroslava Bandera .\nHis father Andrii Bandera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ardent Ukrainian nationalist who had served as a deputy in the short-lived ZUNR ( West Ukraine ) had helped raise armed units of Ukrainian nationalists and had served as a chaplain in the ZUNR \u2019 s army the UHA .\nStepan \u2019 s mother Myroslava was the daughter of a Greek Catholic priest .\nThe Bandera family had four sons and 3 daughters .\nStepan Bandera didn \u2019 t attend elementary school because the village teacher had been drafted .\nInstead his parents home-schooled him , raising him to be a fanatical nationalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unlike his father , Stepan would value his nation even more than religion .\nYoung Stepan Bandera joined the nationalist scout group Plast where he befriended the future head of the OUN Homeland Executive Vasyl Okhrymovich .\nThat friendship would lead Bandera \u2019 s quick rise through the ranks of the OUN .\nBandera joined the nationalist youth group OVKUH where he met future infamous OUN members Roman Shukhevych and Yaroslav Stetsko .\nBy his teen years Bandera and other young future OUN leaders were fanatical fascists who spent their time reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kyi .\nBandera \u2019 s hobbies included singing , hiking , doing impressions , sticking pins under his fingernails , whipping himself , burning himself , and smashing his fingers in door jambs .\nHe was attempting to train himself to resist torture .\nFor young Ukrainian nationalists the Polish high schools were a battleground .\nPoland was determined to teach them loyalty to the new Polish state .\nUkrainians like Bandera were determined to resist by destroying symbols of Polish nationalism and disrupting class as much as possible .\nFor Bandera education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOnce he became head of the Homeland executive Bandera would have one of his former high school teachers Ivan Babii assassinated for being a Ukrainian who followed Polish government orders .\nBy 1927 Bandera had joined the UVO and was doing reconnaissance work for them .\nIn the fall of 1928 Bandera headed for University in Lviv a hotbed of Ukrainian nationalism .\nBandera would never graduate because his studies were constantly interrupted by arrests for nationalist agitation and ties to murders .\nBandera had a sort of split personality .\nHe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizing .\nYet when his work was done loved to joke and play pranks with his fellow OUN members .\nPhysically unimpressive he was a captivating speaker .\nIn the Spring of 1929 , Bandera joined the OUN .\nHe was a talented organizer and rose quickly through the ranks .\nBy 1930 Stepan Bandera was in charge of distributing OUN propaganda .\nHe was nicknamed \u201c Baba \u201d which meant woman because he often cross-dressed as a woman while carrying out his OUN missions .\nIn 1931 Bandera was put in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Gdansk .\nThat was also the year his best friend and the head of the OUN \u2019 s Homeland Executive Okhymovich died after being arrested and possibly tortured by the Polish authorities .\nIvan Habrosevych would became the new head of the Homeland Executive and when he was forced to flee wanted Bandera to replace him .\nHowever Bandera was in prison until June of 1932 and had to settle for being deputy leader upon his release .\nBy January of 1933 Bandera was the de facto head of the OUN Homeland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the OUN conference in Berlin in June of 1933 .\nBandera \u2019 s leadership would see a massive escalation in OUN activity and high profile assassinations .\nHe was acting on the orders of the PUN the OUN leadership in exile .\nThe PUN needed Bandera to stage spectacular attacks that would help their fundraising efforts among Ukraine \u2019 s diaspora in the United States and Canada .\nOUN power and influence in the form of the Ukrainian lobby would continue to grow in the United States and Canada in the decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukrainian population had been notoriously left wing and after the Russian October revolution were considered a serious national security risk because of their widespread support for the new communist regime .\nHowever at the end of the Russian civil war many white Russians and Ukrainian nationalists would relocate to Canada and the US .\nVeterans of the west Ukrainian UHA army formed the Ukrainian War Veterans Association , which along with the Ukrainian National Federation raised over $ 40,000 for the OUN .\nIn the US Henry Ford used a group of Ukrainian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The main sponsors of the OUN were Germany , Lithuania , and Italy .\nGermany and Lithuania provided funding , military training and passports .\nIn the border wars that followed World War 1 , Poland had captured an important chunk of Lithuania including its main city .\nLithuania funded the OUN in revenge .\nItaly provided OUN training bases and Stepan Bandera \u2019 s brother Oleksandr spent years in fascist Italy studying for a degree in political science and engaging in fascist activism .\nItaly was a major backer of the Croatian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Croatian Ustashi and the two groups trained and conspired together .\nBoth groups would later have the distinction of carrying out atrocities that were so horrible that even the Nazis were shocked .\nDuring the Cold War both groups would be among the most influential fascist \u00e9migr\u00e9 groups .\nBoth groups would also return to power at the end of the Cold War .\nA revived Ustashi in Croatia , under Franjo Tudjman in the early 1990s , and the OUN in 2004 and 2014 both incited civil wars and NATO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again in the destruction of Yugoslavia , while the latter would re-ignite war against Russia .\nNazi Germany would become the OUN \u2019 s most important sponsor .\nThe UVO/ OUN \u2019 s espionage no doubt helped the Germans when they invaded Poland .\nWe will return to the Nazi-OUN alliance later .\nIt is interesting to note that Poland also discovered that the OUN were being backed by Britain \u2019 s MI6 .\nBefore turning to the OUN terror campaign in Poland let us examine the OUN ideology .\nThe OUN would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny their collaboration with the Nazis .\nYet in reality they carried out their crimes not just to please their German masters but because it was also fully in accord with their own ideology .\nThe OUN were openly fascist , although there was some debate in their early years whether fascism was possible without control of a state .\nEventually they decided that they would need a fascist movement in order to create a state .\nThis movement would have to be like those Hitler and Mussolini had created to seize control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two types of revolution .\nThe first was a \u201c permanent revolution \u201d , what the OUN called their endless war to indoctrinate the masses with their version of Ukrainian nationalism .\nUkrainians were to be constantly mobilized in the struggle with the Polish government in the process becoming ever more radicalized .\nThe second revolution was to be a \u201c national revolution \u201d .\nUnified by the OUN the Ukrainian people would found a fascist dictatorship and create a Ukrainian state .\nThe OUN despised democracy even more than communism .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Providnyk or a Vozhd the Ukrainian version of a F\u00fchrer .\nOnce a national revolution had been succeeded , the OUN would proceed to eliminate all their enemies : Jews , Poles , Russians and the rest of the ethnic minorities .\nThe cities where Jews often outnumbered Ukrainians would be cleansed .\nIntermarriage between Ukrainians and other ethnicities would be banned .\nEvery area of life sports , culture , religion , and economics would be reorganized in support of the OUN goals .\nAll other political parties were to be banned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Nazi ideology .\nTheir plans had been inspired by the Nuremberg racial laws of Nazi Germany .\nBy the late 1930s Hitler was considered a hero in west Ukraine and the OUN hoped Germany would invade Poland and allow the Ukrainians to establish their own fascist dictatorship .\nHitler however had other plans for Ukraine .\nIn order to wage their permanent revolution , Bandera and the homeland executive waged a terror campaign that became a low intensity civil war .\nThe OUN correctly predicted their terror campaign would lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered to set up an OUN stay behind network that would operate from the forests .\nThe UVO had tried to assassinate the future Polish dictator Pilsudski back in 1921 .\nIt was the OUN assassination campaign that would launch Stepan Bandera into fame or infamy .\nDuring the 1930s the OUN would claim hundreds of victims .\nPoles who mocked Ukrainian nationalists would often end up dead .\nSo would Ukrainians who dared to criticize the OUN .\nBandera was also obsessed with killing suspected traitors within the OUN .\nBandera was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaigns .\nAny OUN member killed was turned into a martyr and a whole cult was set up around the person with the aid of the Greek Catholic Church .\nThis had begun before Bandera \u2019 s time but he was very successful at popularizing it .\nIn addition to foreign financing the OUN relied on armed robbery to raise cash .\nTheir favourite targets were banks and post offices .\nIf one of the robbers happened to be killed he was turned into a hero of Ukraine .\nEvery OUN trial or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the cause .\nThe Ukrainian nationalists had built mounds to honour the fallen UHA soldiers of the short-lived ZUNR government of Western Ukraine .\nBandera ordered all Ukrainian villages to build mounds whether or not there were any soldiers buried there so that they could gather for OUN events .\nThe Polish government in turn ordered the mounds destroyed .\nSoon all over Galicia Ukrainian villagers were battling police with hoes and pitchforks in defence of the mounds .\nThe OUN also began destroying the tombs of Polish soldiers and police .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounds they were often quickly rebuilt .\nBandera neither smoked nor drank .\nIn the Summer of 1933 Bandera decided to launch a national boycott of alcohol and tobacco .\nHowever his goals went beyond health concerns .\nHis real targets were the Jewish merchants who sold alcohol and tobacco , and the Polish Government that got a cut of the sales .\nBandera ordered any Ukrainian caught drinking during the boycott beaten and also ordered a campaign of arson to burn down Jewish-owned taverns .\nThe OUN launched another anti-Semitic campaign where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and break all the windows in Jewish neighbourhoods .\nThey also went around burning down Jewish houses and destroying Polish farms .\nThe OUN also tried to destroy Polish rail lines and telecommunications infrastructure .\nBandera launched a massive campaign to destroy Polish nationalist symbols in schools and ordered the assassination of teachers .\nThe OUN bombed a newspaper they thought was pro-communist .\nMost of the hundreds of OUN victims killed during this period were thus ordinary people whose names are lost to history .\nIt was the OUN \u2019 s high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infamous and nearly end Bandera \u2019 s career .\nOn 22 October 1933 , the OUN attempted to kill the Soviet Consul in Lvov to protest the famine in Ukraine .\nHowever in a case of mistaken identity the assassin killed the secretary to the consulate Aleksei Mailov instead , also wounding a Polish janitor .\nThe assassin Mykola Lemyk received a life sentence for his crime .\nOn 31 March 1934 , Bandera ordered the assassination of OUN member Bachyns \u2019 kyi whom he suspected had ties to Polish intelligence .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; so they all got drunk together and then killed their friend .\nOn 15 June 1934 , the OUN carried out their most successful assassination , killing Polish Interior Minister Bronislaw Pieracki in Warsaw .\nThe assassin Hryhorii Matseiko first tried to kill Pieracki in a suicide bombing .\nHowever he failed to press the trigger hard enough to detonate the bomb .\nInstead Maitseko followed Pieracki and shot him twice in the back of the head .\nHe then opened fire on his pursuers , wounding a policeman .\nManaging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was smuggled into Czechoslovakia and then fled to Argentina with a Lithuanian passport .\nThe morning of his death Pieracki had met with Joseph Goebbels , the Nazi propaganda minister , raising awkward questions after Germany offered refuge to some of the escaped OUN plotters .\nInitially the police suspected the Polish fascist group UNR was responsible .\nHowever the sloppy assassin had left clues like the unexploded bomb and his clothes with a yellow and blue Ukrainian flag sewn into them .\nStepan Bandera had actually been arrested the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured 20 other OUN members , including the bomb maker .\nApparently the Poles did not yet realize that Bandera was the head of the OUN Homeland Executive .\nBandera denied everything including being an OUN member .\nBy 17 June 1934 , the police had solved the Pieracki case .\nHowever they kept quiet .\nInstead Pilsudski turned Pieracki into a national martyr with all the pomp and circumstance that America uses to bury an assassinated president .\nA state of national mourning was declared in Poland .\nAll theatres were closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried around the country by train to be greeted everywhere by mourning crowds .\nThus Poland was at a fever pitch when the government announced that the OUN were responsible on 10 July 1934 .\nTwo weeks later the OUN would carry out another assassination on Bandera \u2019 s orders , killing a Ukrainian high school director and teacher Ivan Babii .\nBabii had once punished Bandera for helping a fellow student cheat on an exam .\nThe assassin , Mykhailo Tsar , shot himself in the head when he realized escape was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukrainian nationalist press , which denounced the OUN as terrorists .\nOn 9 October 1934 , the OUN were accomplices in the Ustashi assassination of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia and the French Foreign Minister Louis Barthou in Marseilles , France .\nMussolini was so embarrassed when his ties to both groups were exposed that he ordered the Ustashi and the OUN confined to two small separate villages in Sicily .\nThe trial of the Ustashi assassins would take place in 1935 , at the same time as the OUN trials in Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the OUN leadership .\nThe Warsaw trial dealt with the assassination of Pieracki and lasted from 18 November 1935 until 13 January 1936 .\nThe Lvov trials dealt with the OUN \u2019 s other murders and crimes and lasted from 25 May 1936 until 27 June 1936 .\nTogether some 20 defendants were tried .\nCzechoslovakian intelligence had raided an OUN leaders home , seizing thousands of pages of OUN documents to which they

members turned on the group and as state \u2019 s evidence agreed to testify , knowing the OUN would no doubt seek revenge by killing them .\nSome OUN defectors felt guilty for the murders of fellow Ukrainians especially fellow OUN members .\nOthers caved in under interrogation .\nThe Polish prosecutor , Zelenski , performed well in proving the state \u2019 s case against the OUN .\nAt the Warsaw trial Bandera and other defendants refused to testify in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluent ) while the court refused to hear testimony in Ukrainian .\nBandera was dragged out of the courtroom kicking and screaming for his contempt of court .\nIt was at the Warsaw trial that the OUN first started using the slogan \u201c Slava Ukraini \u201d publicly in combination with the Roman ( Nazi ) salute .\nVira Svientsitska was the first to shout the slogan with salute in court as she was being dragged from the courtroom for refusing to testify in Polish .\nBandera and Mykola Lebed would shout the slogan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the main OUN figure backed by the CIA , after carrying out horrific crimes for the Germans during the war .\nStepan Bandera , Mykola Lebed and the bomb maker Iaroslav Karpynets \u2019 would all receive death sentences when the Warsaw trial ended on 13 June 1936 .\nThe other defendants received long prison sentences of between 8 and 15 years .\nLuckily for the OUN the Polish Parliament had abolished the death penalty on 2 January 1936 .\nThis act spared the lives of the leaders of a movement that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Poles .\nInstead they were sentenced to life imprisonment .\nPoland used the Pieracki murder as a pretext to build a prison camp for Ukrainians .\nMany low level OUN members were given local trials .\nBy 1938 when Ukrainian owned agricultural firms were refusing to supply the cities\u2014in the wake of a Polish police crackdown on nationalist demonstrators\u2014Poland gaoled some 30,000 Ukrainians .\nThe Lvov trials were more relaxed .\nThe defendants were allowed to testify in Ukrainian and instead of denying their crimes the OUN sought to justify them .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtroom speech where he portrayed himself as a Robin Hood figure helping the poor Ukrainian peasants against the evil Poles and Russians .\nHe put himself forward as the OUN \u2019 s Providnyk or F\u00fchrer ignoring the OUN leader in exile Konavelets .\nIn his speech Bandera argued the true measure of the OUN was not their willingness to die but their willingness to kill and that not hundreds but thousands of people needed to die to in order to fulfil their goals .\nFull of self-serving lies Bandera \u2019 s legendary Lvov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fascists in Ukraine today .\nThe Lvov trial made Bandera a superstar among Ukrainians in Poland and the diaspora .\nArrested the day before the Pieracki assassination Bandera would remain in Polish prisons until his eventual escape in September 1939 .\nBandera and other OUN prisoners used their time in prison to study and organize .\nThey taught some of their fellow Ukrainian prisoners to read and write and each OUN leader gave lectures on a different academic topic .\nIn prison Bandera and the OUN mentored Hryorii Perehinak , who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mass murder of Poles in Volhynia during the war .\nBandera and the OUN waged three hunger strikes which the Polish prison guards ended by force-feeding them through their noses .\nThe OUN also plotted to free Bandera .\nOne plot involved impersonating monks to help Bandera escape .\nThe Polish authorities however were reading the OUN \u2019 s mail and arrested the plotters .\nAnother scheme involved bribing his prison guards to release him with money raised from overseas Ukrainians .\nThe OUN cancelled the plan either because they feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while escaping or they feared reprisals against other OUN prisoners if Bandera escaped .\nThe authorities were so concerned about these OUN plots that they built guard towers at one prison and also kept moving Bandera around .\nThe Bandera escape plans became even more intense after the OUN head Konavalets was assassinated in Rotterdam on 22 May 1938 .\nBandera \u2019 s supporters wanted him free so he could gain control of the OUN .\nPoland had him transferred to a prison in Brest .\nFinally on 1 September 1939 Nazi Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn the chaos Bandera was finally able to escape on 13 September 1939 .\nBandera headed for Lvov .\nA small part of the German military was occupying Galicia .\nThe OUN had risen up and begun by massacring 3,000 Poles and an unknown number of Jews .\nThe remnants of the Polish military were massacring Ukrainians and Jews .\nHowever Bandera quickly realized that the time was net yet right for the OUN to seize power because western Ukraine was about to become part of the Soviet sphere of influence as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBandera and many of the OUN headed for the German occupied portion of Western Poland called the General Government .\nOn 17 September 1939 , the Soviet Union invaded Poland and despite years of OUN propaganda many West Ukrainian \u2019 s welcomed them as liberators .\nBandera \u2019 s family would eventually get caught up in the Soviet crackdown on the OUN in western Ukraine .\nIn March 1941 , a couple months before the German invasion of the USSR , they arrested Stepan \u2019 s father Andrii and two of Stepan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member .\nHis sisters were deported to Siberia while his father was sentenced to be shot .\nBandera headed for Cracow , which was to become home to 30,000 OUN members and their sympathizers .\nAlong the way Bandera stopped in the town of Iavoriv where the OUN and the German military engaged in a brutal massacre of local Jews and burned down the local synagogue .\nBandera never mentioned the incident or other OUN mass murders .\nArriving in Cracow , Bandera soon met his future wife , OUN member Iaroslava Oparivska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1940 .\nBandera had more than romance on his mind .\nHe wanted to seize control of the OUN .\nIn November 1939 Bandera headed for a spa in Slovakia for an OUN meeting .\nThen he headed for Vienna where he met up with the current head of the Homeland Executive Lopatyns \u2019 kyi .\nThey decided to head to Rome to confront the new OUN head Andrii Melnyk .\nMelnyk had been a founding member of the UVO and OUN but was not as well known in Western Ukraine as Bandera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head at the 2nd congress of Ukrainian Nationalists held in Rome in August 1939 .\nThe assassinated OUN head Konovalets had named Melnyk as a successor in his will .\nBandera \u2019 s followers claimed the will was a forgery .\nBandera considered Melnyk \u2019 s top advisers to be traitors .\nBandera and Lopatyns \u2019 kyi arrived in Rome mid January 1940 .\nStepan reunited with his brother Oleksandr , who had earned a PhD in political economy since arriving in Rome in 1933 .\nThey then met with Melnyk and demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bandera \u2019 s picks to OUN leadership and then go into exile in Switzerland .\nMelnyk in return offered to make Bandera one of his advisers but demanded the obedience of the Homeland Executive .\nBandera believed that Melnyk also ordered his assassination so Bandera went into hiding .\nThe OUN was moving towards its split into the OUN/M headed by Melnyk and the OUN/B headed by Bandera .\nOn 10 February 1940 Bandera and his supporters like Roman Shukhevych declared a revolutionary leadership in the OUN .\nSoon each side was expelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side was accusing the other side of being married to Jews and being secretly controlled by the Soviet Union .\nIt became a bit of a comedy that would turn dark .\nDuring the war Bandera would have many of his OUN/M rivals assassinated including Melnyk \u2019 s advisers whom he had labelled as traitors .\nToday the Ukrainian nationalist obsession with traitors in high places remains a defining characteristic of post-Maidan Ukraine .\nBandera \u2019 s OUN/B would ultimately win the power struggle since they enjoyed better connections to OUN activists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among Ukrainians in German-controlled Poland and with the young .\nThe Nazis would work closely with both the OUN/M and the OUN/B .\nThey seemed to favour the OUN/M as more easy to control .\nIdeologically there was little difference between the two and the OUN/B and OUN/M fought over who was the more pro-Nazi .\nFrom 31 March until 3 April 1941 , the OUN/B held their own second Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists at Cracow , deliberately ignoring the Second Congress convened in Rome that had appointed Melnyk head of the OUN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OUN .\nThe OUN/B published a pamphlet expressing their ideology .\nIn the months leading up to the invasion of the Soviet Union they were planning with their German handlers in the Abwehr .\nThe OUN/B claimed \u201c Jews in the USSR are the main pillars of the Bolshevik Regime , and the avant-garde of the Moscow imperialism in Ukraine.\n\u201d They announced that they were planning to ally with Byelorussians , Finns , Lithuanians , Estonians , and Latvians and other \u201c enslaved nations \u201d to destroy the USSR .\nThey announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and replace them with a free enterprise system .\nThey created a red and black OUN/B flag symbolizing blood and soil .\nThey announced their policy as \u201c one people , one Party , and one Leader \u201d .\nOn 10 April 1941 , the OUN expressed elation when the Nazis allowed the Ustashi to carve a Croatian puppet state out of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia .\nThat clerical-fascist state , to which the first Croatian president in 1991 , Franjo Tudjman , belonged , waged a genocidal campaign against Jews , Gypsies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OUN/B sent Croatian dictator Ante Pavelic their personal congratulations by telegram .\nThe Nazis had already created a fascist puppet state in Slovakia .\nHence the OUN/B were convinced that the Nazis would allow Bandera to rule Ukraine as dictator after the German invasion .\nThroughout 1939-1941 both factions of the OUN were working closely with Germany \u2019 s military intelligence the Abwehr headed by Wilhelm Canaris , as well as with the SS .\nTheir Abwehr handlers were Wilhelm Canaris , Theodor Oberlander , Hans Koch , and Alfred Bisasz .\nOberlander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukrainian and Pan-Turkist SS units .\nThe Abwehr provided resources for the OUN to train and arm it \u2019 s forces in German-occupied Poland and Soviet-controlled West Ukraine .\nThe Abwehr recruited 350 OUN members into the Nachtigal Battalion and 330 OUN members into the Roland Battalion .\nA further 800 OUN/B members were trained at the Ievhen Konovalets Military School in Cracow to form task forces that would seize control of local governments and raise Ukrainian militias to carry out genocide .\nThe Abwehr recruited OUN members as spies , translators and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from west Ukraine and sent them back to infiltrate the Soviet Union .\nThe Soviets managed to capture 486 of them as they crossed the border .\nThe Abwehr planned to have the OUN attack Soviet forces from the rear .\nIn May of 1941 , after weeks of work , the OUN/B finalized plans for their role in the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union ( Operation Barbarossa ) , which would begin 22 June that year .\nThe Germans would tell the OUN the exact date of the invasion so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ready .\nTheir plan was recorded in the \u201c Struggles and Activities of the OUN in Wartime.\n\u201d or Struggles and Activities plan for short .\nIt was written by Stepan Bandera , future war criminal Roman Shukhevych , Lenkavs \u2019 kyi and Yaroslav Stetsko ( later head of the World Anti-Communist League \u2019 s Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations , who would be invited to the Reagan White House ) .\nIts goal was to \u201c establish the totalitarian power of the Ukrainian Nation in all Ukrainian territories.\n\u201d It listed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minorities in the Soviet Union like the Baltic States , Belarus , plus the Finns .\nOf course their key ally was the Nazi Germans themselves .\nOUN activists were to travel the countryside proclaiming an independent Ukraine and welcoming the Germans in the name of Stepan Bandera .\nThey would avoid combat with the Red Army leaving that for the German Wehrmacht .\nInstead they would organize the countryside .\nThe plan identified its enemies clearly as Poles , Russians , Jews , and Ukrainians who failed to support the OUN .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plan called for forming militias in the countryside comprising all males aged 18-50 .\nThese gangs would drag off their enemies to forests and other desolate places to be massacred .\nAll Jews were to be registered and then eliminated .\nThe OUN/B was to compile a death list of Poles and NKVD informers .\nThe OUN/B planned to recruit the countryside to purge the cities that were full of Jews , Russians , and Poles .\nThe OUN/B would seize control of all local government ; remake the education system along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the creation of youth groups that would indoctrinate children starting at age 6 .\nAt age 10 they would join the next group and at 18 the next group until at 21 they would join either the OUN , one of its paramilitary formations , cultural or sporting fronts .\nThe plan provided for a huge list of OUN/B fascist slogans to mobilize the masses like \u201c death to Muscovite Jewish Communism.\n\u201d and \u201c Ukraine for Ukrainians.\n\u201d In other words the OUN/B were planning on creating a fascist dictatorship lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews , Poles , and Russians as well as anyone in Ukraine who was an obstacle to their plans .\nHitler however had his own plans for Ukraine and the Soviet Union .\nIn Hitler \u2019 s insane dreams Ukraine was destined to become Germany \u2019 s version of America \u2019 s Wild West or British India .\nHe envisioned German settlers hardened and transformed by the colonization of Ukraine .\nHitler was a big fan of Westerns and cowboys .\nUkrainians were in his view just like the Russians inferior Slavs who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine would become part of Greater Germany .\nHe planned to enslave the populace .\nThe more pragmatic Nazi view was championed by Alfred Rosenberg and by the Waffen SS who saw many useful allies in Eastern Europe like the Ukrainians and championed an international view of fascism .\nDuring the war , as the tide turned against the Nazis , they would increasingly adopt this more pragmatic view ; relying increasingly on their Ukrainian fascist allies .\nOn 22 June 1941 , Germany would invade the Soviet Union and the OUN would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next years would bring untold suffering and horror to the Soviet people .\nThe

.\nWilkinson The Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists or OUN is the most successful post-war fascist group .\nDuring the war the OUN played a major role in helping the Germans carry out the Holocaust , which claimed 1.2 million Jewish lives .\nThey also attempted genocide against the Polish population in Volhynia and Galicia in what is today Western Ukraine .\nThese mass murders were carried out in the most brutal manner imaginable .\nJews were beaten to death with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with axes or cut in half with saws .\nThe OUN took a sadistic delight in humiliating their victims and torturing them to death .\nRussians were sometimes skinned alive .\nThe 2014 CIA coup in Ukraine made the OUN ideology the official ideology of the Ukrainian state .\nEven Ukraine \u2019 s current Jewish president Zelensky , whose family were victims of the mass murder in Ukraine , said of Stepan Bandera \u201c He is a hero for a certain percentage of Ukrainians , and it \u2019 s normal , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been falsified to portray the OUN as heroes who battled both the Nazis and the Soviets .\nYet it is not only in the madhouse that is post-Maidan Ukraine that the history of Ukraine has been falsified .\nBecause of the close ties of the OUN to the American , British , German , Polish and other governments the OUN have also been able to make their twisted mythology into the accepted mainstream version of events .\nThe OUN were considered too valuable by the CIA and other intelligence agencies to have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OUN became a major source for anti-Soviet propaganda , which then became mainstream history .\nDuring the Cold War academia became a major weapon in the battle between capitalism and communism .\nToday nothing has changed and in the new cold war with Russia Ukraine is currently the most important battleground .\nShielding Western publics from the truth about the insanity and cruelty of the Ukrainian fascists the West are supporting is the main goal of the media and academia when it comes to Ukraine .\nUkraine is only the most extreme example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waged across the former Soviet Union and the former Warsaw pact countries of Eastern Europe where pro-western governments seek to turn Nazi collaborators into heroes , demonize the Soviet Union , and destroy all monuments to the role the Soviet Union played in defeating fascism .\nI will be relying mainly on the brilliant work Stepan Bandera : The Life and Afterlife of a Ukrainian Nationalist Fascism , Genocide and Cult by Grzegorz Rossolinski-Liebe , the first critical and scholarly account of the history of the OUN .\nIronically his book was released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil war and Ukrainian nationalists did everything they could to prevent the book from being published , waging a public campaign against the author .\nIn part one of this series I described the origins of Ukrainian nationalism and its transformation into a fascist movement .\nI explained how present day Ukraine had long been divided with Central and Eastern Ukraine controlled by Russia .\nWestern Ukraine , which was originally part of Poland , became part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire when Poland was dismembered in the 18th century .\nAfter World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poland known as the Second Republic , which had absorbed the short , lived Republic of Western Ukraine .\nI traced the origins of the OUN and its terrorist campaign within Poland .\nThe OUN engaged in assassinations , massacres , arson and other crimes .\nThis landed the leader of the OUN \u2019 s Homeland executive Stepan Bandera in prison although his two trials made him famous .\nThe OUN was controlled by its leaders in exile .\nAfter Stepan Bandera escaped from prison , thanks to the German invasion of Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seize the leadership of the OUN .\nThis led the organization to split into an OUN/M answering to Andrei Melnyk and an OUN/B answering to Bandera .\nDuring the brief two-week window after the German invasion of Poland , but prior to the Soviet invasion , the OUN massacred thousands of Jews and also murdered many of the defeated Polish army who were trying to escape or return home .\nThe OUN leaders then headed for Western Poland .\nEastern Poland became Western Ukraine .\nOnce the Soviets arrived they reunified Ukraine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as on the OUN .\nThe exiled OUN leaders in German-occupied Poland , known as the General Government , along with tens of thousands of their supporters who had fled the Soviets , were busy working closely with the Germans , who had been their sponsors for decades , to plan the invasion of the Soviet Union .\nStepan Bandera and the other OUN/B leaders wrote down their plans in the months before the German invasion of the Soviet Union .\nIt was known as the \u201c Struggles and Activities \u201d plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activate its networks to give a welcome the Nazis and form militias for elimination of Jews , Poles , and all non-Ukrainians as well as any Ukrainians who opposed the OUN .\nThe OUN/B came up with a bunch of fascist anti-communist and anti-Semitic slogans with which to blanket the country .\nThe OUN/B and OUN/M were both working closely with the Abwehr , German military intelligence , who provided military training , police training , and political training .\n800 OUN/B members joined special task forces who were to follow the Wehrmacht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support their planned Nazi puppet Government .\n800 other OUN/B members joined the Nachtigall battalion , which was controlled by the Abwehr .\nThe OUN/B also had a network of 20,000 active members in Soviet western Ukraine along with 1.5 million supporters that could be mobilized .\nThe OUN/B planned to declare an \u201c independent \u201d Ukrainian state with Stepan Bandera as its Providnyk or fascist dictator .\nHitler however had other plans for Ukraine .\nHitler viewed Ukrainians as sub-human Slavs , like the Russians , who would have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German settlers .\nUkraine \u2019 s rich black soil would feed the German Reich .\nHitler thought Ukraine would be for Germany what India was for the British or America was for the U.S. who wiped out the Native Americans .\nThe OUN did have a major Nazi ally in the form of Alfred Rosenberg , Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories .\nRosenberg saw the potential of an OUN-controlled Ukraine as a valuable ally .\nThis was the situation on the eve of Nazi Germany \u2019 s invasion of the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1941 .\nThe war would lead to the death of 27 million people in the Soviet Union .\n5.2 million civilians would die in Ukraine .\n2.3 Million Ukrainians would be deported to German slave labour camps .\nOf Ukraine \u2019 s 2.7 million Jews 1.6 million would be killed .\n700 cities and town were destroyed in Ukraine along with 28,000 villages .\nThe impact of the OUN on the success of the Nazi plans to exterminate the Jews was dramatic .\nIn areas that had been long subjected to OUN propaganda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less chance of survival .\nIn Ternopil in Western Ukraine 97 % of the Jews were killed .\nIn contrast , in Kharkov in eastern Ukraine 91 % of the Jews managed to survive .\nThe OUN/B had been warned in advance of the invasion date and had smuggled the \u201c Struggles and Activities \u201d plan into Ukraine with its blueprint for the coming genocide .\nOUN activists spread out across the countryside setting up militias , and local governments .\nOn 25 June 1941 , the OUN/B tried to stage an uprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviets .\nSometimes the OUN/B forces would attack the retreating Red Army .\nHowever they usually waited until after the Red Army retreated before entering an area .\nOn 30 June 1941 , the Wehrmacht entered the city including the Ukrainian Nachtigall battalion whom locals greeted with flowers , calling them the Stepan Bandera battalion .\nThe Nachtigall battalion seized control of the radio station and began broadcasting Nazi and OUN propaganda .\nThat morning the Germans and the OUN discovered that the Soviet secret police the NKVD had massacred its political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent them from collaborating with the Germans .\nMany were doubtless OUN members killed before they could carry out horrific crimes , like Roman Shukhevych \u2019 s brother .\nThis happened in a number of areas and was used by the OUN to scapegoat the Jewish population for the killings .\nThey were falsely accused of being NKVD informants and blamed for the victims \u2019 deaths .\nThis would be the pattern across western Ukraine and where there had been no recent executions those executed in the terror years earlier were dug up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 30 June 1941 small-scale massacres of the Jews of Lvov began .\nThat night at 8 PM Yaroslav Stetsko held a ceremony in which he declared a new Ukrainian state under the leadership of Stepan Bandera .\nThe day would be celebrated by OUN exiles until today as a national holiday .\nWith Stetsko were the Metropolitan of the Greek Catholic Church in Lvov Andrei Sheptyts \u2019 kyi , clergyman and Nachtigall battalion member Ivan Hryn \u2019 okh and two officers in the German Abwehr Hans Koch and Wilhelm Ernst zu Eikern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of a Ukrainian state led by Bandera but paid lip service to the idea of tolerance for minorities .\nHis church would later be implicated in inciting genocide against both the Jews and Polish Catholics .\nThe German Abwehr officers welcomed the celebration but warned that it was not time to declare independence and that only Hitler could decide .\nHitler had already decided against an \u201c independent \u201d Ukraine , which was why Stepan Bandera had been forbidden from returning to Ukraine .\nAccording to OUN mythology and to the OUN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately sent to a concentration camp because of Stetsko \u2019 s premature declaration of independence .\nActually he and Stetsko were placed in \u201c honourable confinement \u201d which initially meant simply that he was confined to Berlin where he could roam freely and was even allowed to carry a pistol for self-defence .\nIt was the later OUN/B murders of leaders of the OUN/M carried out in broad daylight that then provoked a mild German crackdown on the OUN/B .\nI will return to this topic later .\nEven when Bandera was sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a special section reserved for prisoners who might prove useful later , like the leader of the Romanian Iron Guard or Stalin \u2019 s son .\nBandera was given special privileges and needless to say was not treated like the other inmates in a concentration camp .\nHe was not gassed , enslaved , shot , tortured , experimented on or starved to death .\nOn the contrary he was allowed conjugal visits from his wife who served as his go between to the OUN .\nBandera received weekly care packages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell .\nTo return to Lvov by 1 July 1941 the OUN/B and the Germans had whipped the populace up into a fury directed at the city \u2019 s Jews .\nAn angry mob rounded up thousands of Jews and brought them to the prisons where the NKVD \u2019 s victims had been found .\nThe Jewish men were made to move the rotting corpses while they were brutally beaten to death .\nJewish women were made to wash the rotting corpses and kiss their hands before being beaten to death , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by German military units .\nThe OUN/B had formed a Ukrainian militia to conduct the executions on the day they arrived .\nThey would soon be transformed into the Ukrainian police on the orders of Heinrich Himmler , the leader of the SS .\nThey would answer to the SS but remained loyal to Stetsko .\nIt was in their role as auxiliary police recruits that the OUN/B would play a major part in the Holocaust .\nIt was their role to round up the victims , to enforce all the anti-Jewish laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMuch of the killing in Lvov was carried out by angry mobs fired up by OUN propaganda .\nThey loved to humiliate their victims before killing them .\nWomen were stripped naked and often raped in the streets .\nJews were forced to clean up broken glass , with their bare hands and clean streets in front of jeering crowds , whipping them with steel cables .\nJews were forced to sing communist songs before being shot or they were forced to shout Slava Ukraini before being beaten to death .\nEverywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls were plastered with genocidal OUN slogans .\nThe pogrom would last until 3 July 1941 .\nOn 2 July , the Germans took thousands of Jews out to the forest for a mass execution .\nUkrainian peasants streamed in from the countryside with carts to carry the loot they planned to steal from their victims .\nGreed is often a major motivator in genocide .\nAt the high end it involved German corporate takeovers of Jewish-owned business , often financed by American investors .\nIn the Soviet Union there were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other collaborators or German soldiers were able to loot their victims \u2019 personal property .\nRobbery and extortion were a constant in these Ukrainian pogroms .\nAlways the victims were threatened into turning over their valuables then murdered anyway .\nBanderites became synonymous with bandits in the view of their potential victims .\nAround 8,000 Jews were killed in a couple days during the first Lvov Pogrom but the Nazis and the OUN were just getting started .\nDuring the Lvov Pogrom the OUN/B also supplied a death list of Polish professors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe professors were shot along with some of their family members and 100 Polish students .\nA month later to please the OUN/B , angry about Germany \u2019 s refusal to recognize Ukraine \u2019 s independence and the arrests of Bandera and Stetsko , the Germans gave them permission to hold a second Lvov Pogrom from 25-28 July 1941 , known as the Petliura days in honour of the mass murdering Symon Petliura .\nPetliura was infamous for his army \u2019 s massacres of Jews during the Russian Civil War , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the countryside the same pattern was repeated .\nThe OUN/B held Independence Day ceremonies , destroyed all communist symbols , put up Ukrainian flags and Nazi Swastikas and then launched pogroms .\nThere were up to 140 Pogroms in Western Ukraine in July 1941 and they claimed 35,000 to 39,000 victims .\nThe biggest pogroms besides Lvov were in Ternopil and Zolochiv .\nDuring this period the OUN/B were not merely carrying out German orders but were enthusiastically carrying out genocide in line with their own ideology .\nThey conducted massacres of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German presence .\nWhen the Hungarian forces forbade the OUN from carrying out a big pogrom , they defiantly carried out a little one and then complained to the Germans .\nAcross the countryside the OUN erected triumphal arches welcoming the Nazis and praising Stepan Bandera and Adolf Hitler .\nThe Nazis were greeted by adoring crowds and their invasion was blessed by the Greek Catholic clergy .\nOUN/B activists had the crowds sign \u201c plenipotentiary letters \u201d which praised Hitler and the German Army while also asking for the release of Stepan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early days of the German invasion , Stepan Bandera had set up his headquarters close to Ukraine and used couriers to communicate his orders to the OUN/B .\nHe had ordered and approved of the massacres of Jews .\nStetsko \u2019 s 30 June 1941 declaration of independence had angered the Germans .\nBandera did his best to repair relations with the Nazis .\nOn 3 July 1941 , Bandera attended a meeting in Cracow with the Undersecretary of State for the General Government Ernst Kundt ( German occupied Poland ) .\nBandera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the will of the people that he head Ukraine .\nKundt countered that only Hitler could decide such matters .\nBandera conceded that he could only create a Ukrainian state with German permission .\nOn 5 July 1941 , Bandera was sent to Berlin and placed in \u201c Honourable Captivity \u201d .\nOn 8 July 1941 , someone tried to assassinate Yarsolav Stetsko and on 9 July 1941 , Stetsko was arrested and escorted by the Abwehr to Berlin .\nOn 12 July 1941 Stetsko was freed .\nOn 14 July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined to Berlin and lived together in an apartment .\nBandera was allowed to carry a gun and held an ID issued by the RSHA ( Heidrich \u2019 s \u201c Homeland Security \u201d department ) .\nThese two networked with the Lithuanian fascists in exile and the Japanese ambassador .\nStetsko kept busy writing his autobiography for his German handlers : writing that , while he considered Moscow his main enemy , he fully endorsed exterminating the Jews since he considered them tools of Moscow .\nOn 19 July 1941 , Hitler decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government .\nThis offended the OUN/B who wanted to rule a united Ukraine .\nNow their territory was being absorbed back into German-occupied Poland .\nActually it turned out to be beneficial to the OUN/B \u2019 s interests as Ukrainians in Galicia were favoured over the Poles and Jews and they were allowed to continue to carry out Ukrainization of Polish educational institutions .\nUkrainians in East Galicia were treated like fascist allies Slovakia and Croatia .\nThe Nazis set up UTSK in the Ukrainian Central Committee run by Volodymyr Kubiiovych in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close ally of the OUN in the 1930s and shared their ideology while being more flexible .\nHe lobbied for the creation of a Ukrainian National Army to fight alongside the Nazis and argued that all Jewish property should be turned over to Ukrainians .\nIn 1943 he would get his wish with the creation of the Waffen-SS Galizia division , composed of Ukrainians .\nUkrainians in the former Soviet Ukraine on the other hand were mercilessly exploited .\nAll education beyond the 4th grade was banned .\nThe Germans modelled their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners treating Ukrainian peasants like Black slaves who could only be kept in check with whips and clubs .\nThe main goal was to loot Ukraine \u2019 s grain .\nThe result would be very different attitudes towards the memory of the Nazis in Western and Eastern Ukraine .\nOn 30 August 1941 , the OUN/B assassinated the OUN/M leaders Melina Senyk and Mykola Stibors \u2019 kyi in broad daylight on the streets in Zhytomyr .\nThis outraged the Germans and other Ukrainian nationalists .\nThe Germans were further outraged when the OUN/B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe OUN/M provided the Germans with names and addressees of OUN/B leaders who were then arrested .\nThe Germans also shot some OUN/B members as looters and closed their offices in Berlin and Vienna .\nThey tried and failed to purge the administration and police of OUN/B members .\nOn 13 September 1941 , Bandera and Stetsko were arrested again .\nDespite this both continued efforts to repair relations with the Germans .\nBoth sent orders to the OUN/B not to resist the Germans and to continue to supply recruits for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after being sent to a cushy concentration camp and even after two of his brothers died in a concentration camp , Bandera never ceased attempts at reconciliation with the Germans .\nEven when it became clear the Germans were losing in 1944 , Bandera was more committed then ever to allying the OUN/B with the Nazis .\nThe German purge was totally ineffective .\nThe OUN/B was continually flooded with new recruits and continued to grow in power .\nThe head of the Ukrainian police simply ignored orders to get rid of OUN/B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nazis turned on the OUN/B the organization continued to supply recruits for the police , which would play a major role in carrying out the holocaust .\nMany Ukrainian police would also go on to join the Waffen SS Galizia division .\nOthers would later join the UPA , using their experience in mass murder to massacre Poles .\nThe Ukrainian police were formed from the Ukrainian militias that the OUN/B had recruited in the wake of the German invasion .\nThey were known as the Schutzmannschaften or auxiliary police .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s earlier crackdown , the OUN/B ordered its members to join the police en masse .\nThe Ukrainian police answered ultimately to Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler , overall commander of the SS .\nIt was ordered that they be given two hours of Nazi indoctrination every day .\nIn the cities the Ukrainian police assisted in raids , deportations , and shootings .\nThey also patrolled the ghettoes .\nThey enforced the anti-Jewish laws , forced Jews to wear identifying arm bands , created death lists by interviewing locals , rounded up the victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the site of the execution and often shot the victims , especially if they were children .\nThe Nazis had their own killing squads , the Einsatzgruppe C that also carried out many of the mass executions .\nIn the countryside there were few German forces or German police and the Ukrainian Police played the leading role in destroying the Jews and then spent years hunting down the survivors .\nThe Ukrainian police often displayed the same sadistic brutality the OUN/B had shown in the Lvov pogroms .\nOne survivor recounted being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims who were forced to desecrate their holy books .\nSome had had their beards set aflame .\nThe fire then spread to their clothes and they were burned alive .\nOthers were beaten to death .\nThroughout it all the victims were forced to sing to entertain their Ukrainian tormentors .\nThe Ukrainian police were used not only to terrorize Ukraine but also to terrorize Belarus , Poland , Slovakia and other areas .\nParticularly infamous was Battalion 201 , which included Roman Shukhevych .\nHe would also join the Waffen-SS Galizia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nShukhevych , a monster like Bandera , is now widely promoted as a \u201c Hero of Ukraine.\n\u201d In addition to carrying out mass murders of Jews , Byelorussians and Poles ; Shukhevych loved to have Eastern Ukrainian \u2019 s shot for little or no reason and privately contemplated exterminating them all .\nMany recruits to Battalion 201 like Shukhevych had been part of the Abwehr \u2019 s Nachtigall and Roland battalions and carried out mass murders of Byelorussian civilians as part of their anti-partisan warfare in 1942 .\nEarly in 1943 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also known as the 14th Grenadier Division of the Waffen-SS .\nIt was called Galician instead of Ukrainian to pander to Hitler .\nHitler , born in Austria-Hungary , felt that since Galicia had once been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire , there was probably some German blood in them .\nOver 80,000 Ukrainians volunteered to join the SS Galizia but only 8,000 were accepted .\nIt soon expanded to 14,000 men by recruiting members of the Ukrainian police .\nThe Ukrainian general commanding the SS Galicia was Pavlo Shandruk .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Army .\nIt was also deployed to crush the Slovakian national uprising and played a major role in the destruction of Warsaw after the Warsaw uprising .\nOn 22 July 1944 the Waffen SS Galicia division , by then much larger , was encircled and destroyed by the 1st Ukrainian Front of the Red Army under the command of Pavel Rybalko .\nThey were decimated by the Soviet artillery and Katyusha rocket batteries .\nHowever the Germans were able to replace the units by recruiting more members and the SS Galicia division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partisans and civilians in Italy , Yugoslavia , France and Czechoslovakia .\nThey surrendered to the British two days after the war ended and with the help of the Vatican were able to avoid deportation back to the Soviet Union by claiming to be Polish citizens .\nEventually they would end up in Britain before being resettled in Canada and America strengthening the OUN diaspora during the Cold War .\nUnknown to most citizens of Canada and the US there are public monuments to these Waffen SS veterans in both countries .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OUN/B were joining the Waffen SS en masse , and while they were setting up the UPA to exterminate the Poles , the OUN/B was publicly distancing themselves from the Nazis and secretly trying to forge an alliance with the western allies for a future struggle with the Soviet Union .\nHere the considerations were the Soviet victory at Stalingrad foreboding Germany \u2019 s ultimate defeat .\nThe more farsighted Nazis were already planning their escapes , and their deals with Western intelligence agencies .\nThe hardliners in American and British Intelligence like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a covert war against the Soviet Union using committed anti-communists and anti-Russians among their current fascist \u201c enemies \u201d ( for men like Dulles they were friends and business partners ) .\nWhen Poland was investigating the Pieracki assassination in the mid-1930s , it discovered that the OUN had ties to MI6 as well as the German Abwehr .\nWhen it comes to such matters the historical evidence is always a sanitized version or some sort of limited hang out .\nThe CIA spent decades destroying incriminating records and declassifying misleading or altered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying we will never know the early history of the ties of the OUN with MI6 and the OSS and US military intelligence during the war .\nThe OUN/B was already trying to improve their image in the west in April 1942 .\nAt their second OUN/B conference they claimed that they would no longer take part in anti-Jewish actions .\nAt the same conference they still condemned Jews as \u201c a tool of Russian Bolshevik Imperialism .\nIn addition the OUN/B did not quit the police and so continued to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder of Jews .\nBy 1943 the Jews had largely been eliminated in western Ukraine .\nThe survivors were being hunted by the Ukrainian police , which was full of OUN/B members .\nAt their third Conference from 17-21 February , the OUN/B was now claiming that it would fight both Germany and the USSR and that they were now democrats ruled by a triumvirate , led by the ( war criminal ) Roman Shukhevych .\nIn July 1944 the OUN sent emissaries to attempt to make a deal with the Western allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the OUN internal security branch or SB , known for its bloodthirsty assassinations of alleged OUN traitors .\nLebed would later receive decades of backing from the CIA .\nIn July of 1944 the OUN/B furthered their \u201c Democratic \u201d rebranding , creating the front group UHVR , the Supreme Liberation Council of Ukraine .\nIt would later provide many recruits for the CIA and MI6 .\nA few months before the February 1943 OUN conference , the OUN started what was to become the UPA .\nContrary to myth the UPA only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms .\nIt made a secret deal with the German military to avoid confrontations .\nThe UPA was formed for the purpose of exterminating the Poles and despite the OUN \u2019 s public statements that it would fight the Germans , the UPA was secretly funded by the Abwehr ( German military intelligence ) .\nWhen the Germans retreated the Abwehr secretly turned over the Wehrmacht \u2019 s huge arms stockpiles to the UPA .\nStill the OUN \u2019 s two-faced strategy to win Western support would be very useful later for muddying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the OUN had battled both the Nazis and the Soviet Union .\nThe UPA would later become a CIA proxy army run with the help of war criminal Reinhard Gehlen .\nIt would wage an anti-Soviet war for five more years after the end of World War 2 .\nSeventy years later the return of Ukrainian fascism to power via the Maidan coup would be universally celebrated as the triumph of \u201c Democracy.\n\u201d The UPA was founded at the November 1942 OUN conference although it originally was called the UVV the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name UPA or Ukrainian Insurgent Army from a rival group of Ukrainian fascists lead by Taras Bulba-Borovets who led his own armed group in Ukraine with a similar ideology and methodology to the OUN/B .\nIt too shared responsibility for mass murders of Jews and other Ukrainians .\nThe OUN/B waged war on this rival group assassinating Bulba-Borovets \u2019 wife and many of his top officers .\nWhen he went to the Germans for help they instead sent him to the same cushy concentration camp as Bandera and Stetsko .\nIn March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word that its many members in the Ukrainian police should quit and join the UPA .\nOf 12,000 police , 5000 quit to join the UPA .\nOther Ukrainian police joined the Waffen-SS Galizia division .\nThe new UPA recruits brought their experience in mass murder of Jews to the new plan for ethnic cleansing of Volhynia and Galicia of Poles .\nPoles were given the ultimatum leave or die .\nOften the threat was posted on a murdered Pole who had been unspeakably tortured and mutilated .\nIn February and March of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed hundreds of lives .\nWhole Polish villages were wiped out .\nSoon Mykola Lebed ordered the complete cleansing to begin .\nThe UPA would arrive in carts to carry away the loot and often recruited local Ukrainian peasants to join their massacres .\nThe massacres were often carried out in the most horrific way possible with axes , pitchforks and saws .\nThe UPA would sometimes spend hours sadistically torturing their victims to death .\nThe aim was both to save bullets and to terrorize the Poles into fleeing .\nAnother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hand grenades or set them on fire when the whole town was attending .\nThey also liked to gather all their victims up for a town hall meeting and burn them alive .\nThe UPA would usually return again a couple days after their massacre so that they could kill all the survivors .\nThey even slaughtered nuns who were caring for Polish orphans .\nOn 11 July 1943 , the UPA launched attacks on 96 different Polish villages in a single day killing 10,000 Poles .\nThe UPA killed between 100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe UPA would often pretend to be Soviet partisans and in addition to carrying out false flag attacks that could be blamed on the partisans they were probably playing their role for German intelligence , gathering information on which villages were sympathetic to the partisans .\nThe UPA also continued to hunt the few remaining Jews who were hiding out in the forests or in Polish villages .\nThe UPA had learned from the Germans how to exploit their Jewish victims .\nSome were kept as slave labour working the farmlands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be liberated by the Red Army .\nOthers Jews who were doctors , dentists , nurses or tailors were conscripted into the UPA and then murdered when the Red Army was approaching .\nLater these facts would be spun by OUN apologists into the myth that the UPA wasn \u2019 t allied to the Nazis because it had Jewish members or that the UPA had acted to \u201c save \u201d the Jews .\nBy 1944 the UPA had grown to 25,000-30,000 members .\nWith Soviet forces advancing the UPA was now openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks on the Jews hiding in the forests were so terrible that some Jews actually fled to German concentration camps believing their chances of survival would be better as slave labourers .\nIn the summer of 1944 the Red Army would liberate Western Ukraine .\nThe UPA would continue to kill Poles and increasingly began to target any Ukrainians who submitted to Soviet authority .\nAnyone who paid their taxes or joined a collective farm could be killed or have their home burnt down by the UPA .\nThe UPA would become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind enemy lines , created first by the Nazis and then absorbed by MI6 and the CIA .\nThe UPA war with the Soviet Union would continue until 1950 .\nTheir network would survive into the 1960s .\nThe UPA war was not only waged in Ukraine but also in Poland , Byelorussia , and Czechoslovakia .\nThe story of the UPA will be continued in Part 3 of this series dealing with the Cold War .\nAs the war turned in favour of the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany faced defeat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the OUN/B .\nThe Nazis granted an OUN/B request to be allowed to meet with Stepan Bandera .\nThe details of Bandera \u2019 s imprisonment are clouded in mystery .\nIt is not clear when exactly he was transferred from Gestapo custody following the OUN/M murders to his cushy Sachenhausen concentration camp , where he received care packages and visits from his wife .\nStetsko claimed it was in January 1942 .\nBandera claimed it was in 1943 .\nRecords claim it was October 1943 .\nOn 28 September 1944 , the Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released Stetsko , Melnyk , Bulba-Borovets and 300 more OUN/B prisoners .\nMelnyk had been arrested when the OUN/M tried to contact Western intelligence in 1944 .\nThe OUN/M had had much better relations with the Nazis and was appointed to serve in the puppet government .\nIt had supplied many recruits to the Waffen SS Galicia division .\nBandera would spend the rest of the war working with the Nazis to recruit Ukrainian support to their cause .\nHowever Bandera would refuse to merge OUN forces with the Vlasov army \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Peoples of Russia- created 14 November 1944 .\nBandera claimed they were \u201c Russian Imperialists.\n\u201d Instead Rosenberg set up the separate Ukrainian National Committee ( UNK ) , which included Bandera , Melnyk , Kubiiovych and was headed by Shandruk , the general commanding the Waffen SS Galicia division on 23 February 1945 .\nPrior to this , in December 1944 , Bandera and Stetsko helped train the Abwehr Commando \u2019 s unit of Ukrainian paratroopers who were to be dropped into Lvov with one million rubles for UPA head Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union .\nBandera sent the message that he would return soon , a promise he never kept .\nStetsko claimed that he was still Prime Minister of Ukraine because of his earlier declaration back in 30 June 1941 ; the one that had unleashed a wave of OUN/B massacres .\nBandera \u2019 s next stop , after celebrating Greek Catholic Christmas with his family , was Weimar , Germany .\nBandera argued that the OUN/B must give its \u201c Full Support \u201d to Nazi Germany until the end .\nHe was busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukrainian National Army ( UNA ) .\nBandera spent three weeks in Berlin .\nHe then headed for Vienna where he was elected head of the Foreign Units of the OUN ( ZCh OUN ) .\nOn 5-6 February 1945 , the OUN in Ukraine elected Bandera as their leader but decided he should remain in exile .\nOn 17 March 1945 , the Germans announced the creation of the Ukrainian National Army ( UNA ) .\nThe Waffen SS Galicia division was rebranded the 1st division of the UNA and its commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UNA .\nMeanwhile Bandera fled Vienna as the Red Army approached , escaping to Czechoslovakia and then Innsbruck in Austria .\nEventually Bandera would end up under the protection of the infamous Reinhard Gehlen , the first president of the Bundesnachrichtendienst ( BND ) , the espionage service founded by the US Forces in the American occupation zone .\nGehlen had been recruited by the US intelligence services because he had been responsible for occupied Eastern Europe in the Abwehr .\nWhen German forces fled the Red Army back in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and war criminals fled west with them .\nDuring the Cold War many of these escaped Ukrainian war criminals would work for Western intelligence services .\nMany would eventually be resettled in the US and Canada .\nUkrainian fascism would live on in exile for decades .\nEventually with the help of its Western sponsors it would seize power in Ukraine yet again sparking a new covert war and triggering the on-going proxy war between NATO and Russia .\nFor Ukraine the war would not truly end until 1950 .\nHowever that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only a scratch to the surface of the history of Ukraine during the war .\nThe crimes of the Nazi Germany would require their own articles or books .\nThe Nazis created massive machinery for genocide .\nHowever they relied on Ukrainian collaborators every step of the way .\nAn article also needs to be written just about the German conquest of Ukraine and the Soviet liberation of Ukraine .\nThese were huge battles between millions of men .\nHowever the crimes of the OUN are clear .\nThey propagandized the Ukrainians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OUN/B created militias that carried out genocide in 1941 and again in 1943 .\nThey supplied recruits to the Ukrainian police , which played a major role in the Holocaust .\nThey joined the Waffen SS Galicia division along with the OUN/M .\nThey formed the UPA to carry out genocide and ethnic cleansing against the Poles .\nBandera was unable to supervise this directly but he came up with the plans before being imprisoned and after his release he worked enthusiastically for the Nazis .\nBandera never admitted to the OUN/B \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemning them .\nHis OUN followers took an active role carrying out unspeakable atrocities .\nBanderite became a synonym for murderous bandits .\nThere has been shamefully little written about the history of the OUN and much of what was written was from a pro-OUN perspective .\nSadly due to the nature of academia the more relevant the story of the OUN becomes the fewer people will dare to tell it for fear of being labelled \u201c Russian propagandists.\n\u201d After the Orange revolution of 2004 Stepan Bandera was declared a \u201c Hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamp was issued commemorating him .\nDuring the 2014 Maidan coup , a huge poster of Stepan Bandera hung on the stage .\nFew in the west had ever heard of Stepan Bandera or the OUN back in 2014 .\nNow in 2022 the world is on the brink of nuclear war and the global economy is collapsing all because CIA and other western intelligence agencies have been using Ukrainian fascists as proxies for nearly 80 years .\nIn Parts 3 and 4 , I intend to trace the history of the OUN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War and post-Cold War eras up to the Maidan coup and the Ukrainian civil war .\nMy main source is Stepan Bandera : The Life and Afterlife of a Ukrainian Nationalist : Fascism , Genocide and Cult , an in depth history of Stepan Bandera and the OUN .\nIt is a must read although written with the standard academic anti-Soviet bias .\nI also read \u201c Children of the Borderlands \u201d by Lucyna Kulinska , a collection of survivors \u2019 testimonies from the Polish victims of the UPA genocide .\nAn English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives a vivid and horrifying picture of events .\nHowever it is edited from a strongly anti-Soviet perspective .\nStill the author should be applauded for exposing a forgotten genocide , which the strongly pro-Ukrainian Polish government is intent on covering up .\nHitler \u2019 s Shadow Nazi , War Criminals , U.S. Intelligence and the Cold War by Richard Breitman and Norman J.W .\nGoda has a chapter on Mykola Lebed and the CIA ties to the OUN .\nBased on declassified U.S. intelligence files , it provides a limited hangout version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holocaust in Ukraine by Wendy Lower provides a horrifying picture of the German occupation and the complex machinery that carried out the genocide .\nHowever it is extremely misleading whenever discussing the OUN/B , always portraying it as hostile to the Nazis .\nPerhaps that is because the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute funded her work .\nWorse still , she worked closely with the archetypical Cold War propagandist/historian Timothy Snyder , who helped her edit the book .\nGenerally if you want to uncover an author \u2019 s shady connections look in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMoss Robeson on the history of the OUN One of my favourite documentary series the Unknown War had an episode on Ukraine while it doesn \u2019 t mention the
