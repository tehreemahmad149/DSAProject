Commercial", "content": "For months , media has been hyping the \u201c metaverse \u201d , a network of 3D virtual worlds in which people engage using avatars .\nConsidered to be the \u201c next phase of the internet \u201d , tech giants such as Microsoft are currently investing billions of dollars to create an alternate reality where people will be able to \u201c work , play , shop , and meet virtually \u201d .\nIndeed , nothing would make them happier than to turn humanity into a collection of isolated individuals who can not accomplish anything without some tech gizmo strapped to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invested in the metaverse , the main hypeman for it is Mark Zuckerberg .\nThe picture above aptly symbolizes the future they are trying to create : A bunch of people staring into machines as their overlord watches over .\nThis picture is also fascinating for another reason : The faces of the two main subjects in this picture .\nZuckerberg is smiling .\nThe sitting guy next to him .\nNot smiling at all .\nIn fact , his mouth is literally an upside-down smile .\nI didn \u2019 t even know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fact that every attempt at strapping crap on people \u2019 s heads resulted in monumental flops ( remember TVs with 3D glasses ? )\n, tech giants are marching on .\nAnd they keep flopping on .\nDespite the failures , Zuckerberg is so invested in the metaverse that he renamed his company Meta .\nThe Meta logo is a droopy-looking , deformed version of the infinity symbol .\nWhy did they choose this symbol ?\nOfficial PR says that it \u2019 s because \u201c the metaverse has infinite possibilities \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot more to it .\nThe infinity symbol has occult origins , tracing all the way back to the symbol of the Ouroboros .\nThe Ouroboros is found in countless occult and alchemical symbols , including the Leviathan Cross \u2013 also known as Satan \u2019 s Cross .\nThe Leviathan Cross is also known as Satan \u2019 s Cross .\nThe symbol is a combination of two images that each has a specific meaning .\nThe bottom loop represents infinity ; the double cross on top is the Cross of Lorraine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and higher spiritual realms .\nIn alchemy , this symbol also represents the chemical sulfur ( or brimstone ) and is believed to be an analogy for the human soul itself .\nCreated by the Knights of Templar and co-opted by the founder of the Church of Satan , Anton LaVey , this symbol is used to invite Satan into the soul .\nThe symbol was created to mock the cross and make a point about humans being their own centrum of balance and truth .\n\u2013 Graveyard Shift , Be Wary Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connections Did Meta select this symbol due to its occult origins ?\nThat might sound far-fetched .\nHowever , the ad meant to introduce Meta to the world is replete with occult symbolism .\nHere \u2019 s a look at it .\nBefore even watching the video on YouTube , we can notice that the likes/dislikes and comments are turned off .\nThat \u2019 s usually a clear indicator that people absolutely hate the video .\nBut why ?\nAlthough the ad is objectively well-produced , it sends off a creepy , disturbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people feel uneasy .\nAnd when one understands the symbolism on display , that feeling only gets worse .\nBehind the group are paintings by Hilma af Klint \u2013 a Swedish artist whose works are pure occultism .\nA 2016 article in The Guardian article titled \u201c Hilma af Klint : a painter possessed \u201d explains her work process .\nIn short , the makers of the Meta ad selected these paintings to be placed behind these kids for a reason : They foreshadow the occult symbolism we are about to witness .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting .\nAs the kids approach the painting , it becomes 3D .\nThen , things get weird .\nThe tiger says \u201c This is the dimension of imagination \u201d .\nIt \u2019 s actually a soundbite sampled from the intro of The Twilight Zone , a classic fantasy/horror TV show about surreal and paranormal experiences .\nAs we \u2019 ll see , this Meta ad is all about presenting this new technology as some sort of mystical , spiritual experience .\nBut there \u2019 s something \u201c off \u201d about that experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the tiger , a literal predator that \u2019 s in the process of killing a buffalo , introduces Meta to kids .\nWhen the kids approach the tiger , it pats the buffalo on the head , as if it was trying to deceive them into thinking that it is not predatory .\nThe kids then \u201c enter \u201d the painting and see more wildlife scenes .\nNone of these scenes are in actual Rousseau paintings , they are extrapolations made by the ad creators .\nMore importantly , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding strange symbols all over the place .\nFirst , there \u2019 s an owl \u2013 a symbol that has been representing the occult elite for centuries .\nWhile the owl alone in the ad might not be a direct reference to the occult elite , other symbols in the scene complete the picture .\nFor instance , in the background , for no specific reason , we see the planet Saturn .\nTo make sure you understand that this is all about occult symbolism , there \u2019 s also a hexagon .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ polygon sides points directly to one of the most ancient concepts in occultism : The ancient link between Saturn and the hexagram ( six-pointed star ) .\nIn short , the combination of the planet Saturn and the hexagon in the Meta ad is not \u201c pure randomness \u201d .\nIt is pure symbolism .\nInteresting fact : A few decades ago , astronomers discovered an actual hexagon on Saturn .\nGoing further in ancient symbolism , there is also a deep , occult connection between Saturn and the concept of Satan .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ could fill a book , but here \u2019 s the gist of it : Saturn is the ruling planet of the astrological sign of Capricorn , which is represented by a goat \u2019 s head .\nDepending on the culture , Saturn is associated with the goat-headed god Pan , the father of time Kronos ( who devours his children ) , and the grim reaper .\nSaturn is associated with the limitations of the physical realm versus the infinity of the spiritual realm .\nSo , yes , there \u2019 s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meta ad appears to go out of its way to confirm the occult meaning of these symbols .\nThe video ends with the phrase \u201c This is going to be fun \u201d .\nSounds like something a creep would say before doing something creepy .\nAn important detail that sums up the entire video : The buffalo only has one eye : One-eye sign .\nIn exactly 1 minute and 20 seconds , the Meta ad manages to convey several odd messages .\nFirst , this new technology preys on young people ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally a predator ) .\nSecond , it seeks to immerse ( or entrance ) these people into an alternate world where every pixel is created and controlled by a big tech company .\nFinally , this world is filled with heavy occult symbolism , which adds a spiritual dimension to this experience .\nIt is as if they were saying : \u201c God created this world , but WE are creating a new one \u201d .\nDo you want to be a part of it ?", "author": "Vigilant Citizen", "url": "https://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/the-occult-symbolism-of-the-creepy-meta-commercial/", "published": "Thu, 06 Jan 2022 15:38:46 +0000",

keeps winning all kinds of awards ; He keeps hooking up with celebrities such as Bella Hadid , Selena Gomez , and ( apparently ) Angelina Jolie ; He \u2019 s currently selling his Los Angeles pad dubbed \u201c The Mogul \u201d for $ 22.5 million \u2026 because he bought a $ 69 million megamansion in Bel Air .\nSeriously , The Weeknd is a BIG DEAL .\nAnd he knows it .\nFive years ago , he celebrated the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the song Starboy where he poignantly sings : \u201c I \u2019 m motherf*cking starboy \u201d .\nMore importantly , the video symbolically depicted his ascension to a higher level in the music industry .\nAs an ultimate confirmation of his superstardom , The Weeknd performed at the 2021 Super Bowl halftime show \u2013 the biggest televised event of the year .\nAnd that was all very symbolic as well .\nWhile we all know that The Weeknd is a BIG DEAL , there \u2019 s an important theme in nearly all of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great price .\nHis new album Dawn FM continues with the same narrative .\nThe concept behind Dawn FM is described as \u201c listening to a retro-pop radio station while in purgatory \u201d .\nThroughout the album , a radio DJ ( voiced by actor Jim Carey ) guides The Weeknd ( and the listeners ) towards \u201c the light \u201d , which might refer to death .\nAlthough that \u2019 s already a grim concept , \u201c the light \u201d might actually be something else .\nThe first video from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there \u2019 s a dark spiritual meaning behind the album .\nSeriously , that video is basically VC 101 .\nI mean , the name itself says it all : It \u2019 s all about sacrificing one \u2019 s soul to the occult elite .\nSome might say : Bro , check out the video and please tell me what part is about a relationship .\nThe video begins by introducing the concept behind Dawn FM .\nAs The Weeknd stands in a dark room , we hear the radio DJ say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbolism going on here .\nFirst , Lucifer is known as the \u201c son of the dawn \u201d in the Bible and various mythologies .\nAlso , the word Lucifer literally means \u201c light-bringer \u201d in Latin .\nThis is because Lucifer is esoterically associated with the planet Venus , the star seen at dawn .\nSo , when DJ Jim Carey ( from the station Dawn FM ) tells The Weeknd to \u201c walk into the light \u201d , we are deep in Luciferian symbolism .\nThis is not about physical death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebirth \u2013 the goal of occult initiations .\nThis is confirmed by the fact that Carey also says \u201c you \u2019 ve been in the dark for way too long \u201d .\nAnother element that hints at Sacrifice being about occult initiation : The REST OF THE ENTIRE VIDEO .\nThis scene is basically The Weeknd getting crucified .\nWe are witnessing a satanic black mass where Christian rites and symbols are twisted , mocked and desecrated .\nI \u2019 ve been analyzing music videos since 2009 and I \u2019 ve always stressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretly deeply ritualistic .\nToday , videos are all-out rituals , they \u2019 re no hiding it anymore .\nFurthermore , I \u2019 ve always highlighted the all-important color code in these videos where red represents sacrifice during initiation .\nWell , in this video called Sacrifice , The Weeknd gets \u201c initiated \u201d by a red hooded figure .\nAnd that initiation doesn \u2019 t seem pleasant at all .\nConsidering the occult context of the video , that red figure probably extracted The Weeknd \u2019 s soul or life force .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to make it big in the music industry .\nThen , the red-hooded figure is revealed .\nThe video ends with The Weeknd walking away .\nHe \u2019 s got some stuff to do and people to see .\nBecause he \u2019 s a BIG DEAL .\nIf somehow , you still believe that Sacrifice is about a relationship , the video for the remix makes things even clearer .\nThe remix video sums up the goal of the industry : After \u201c infecting \u201d The Weeknd with its rotten illness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world .\nWhile critics are swooning over the originality and the creativity of Dawn FM , the Sacrifice video is anything but original and creative .\nIn fact , it follows the same exact blueprint used by countless music videos with ritualistic symbolism , right down to the color red representing blood sacrifice and occult initiation .\nThe concept of Dawn FM is about following \u201c the light \u201d .\nHowever , when one understands the meaning of Sacrifice , it becomes abundantly clear that we are actually talking about \u2026 @ @ @ @", "author":

wonderful place of welcome and opportunity which allowed everyone to flourish and prosper .\nI was born and raised in Canada and I \u2019 ve always been proud and appreciative of this fact .\nIn fact , every time I hear the national anthem , I get slight chills when I hear this one specific line : But then COVID hit .\nAnd it did not take long before Canada lost some of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis is especially true in one specific province : Quebec .\nWhile most of the world had to deal with harsh COVID restrictions , Quebec consistently lead the world in the extreme severity of its measures .\nDespite an abundantly funded universal healthcare system that is \u201c the envy of the world \u201d , Quebec spent 13 out of the last 22 months in a strict lockdown where most businesses were closed and most social interactions banned .\nIn 2022 , although 90 % of the population is vaccinated , things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being set .\nHere \u2019 s a look at life in Quebec right now .\nWhen COVID hit Quebec in 2020 , it responded ( like most of the world ) with a massive and total lockdown .\nSchools and businesses were closed for two weeks to \u201c flatten the curve \u201d .\nThese weeks turned into months .\nDuring that time , a slew of measures was imposed on the public by a government that suspended democracy and began ruling by decree .\nThis is is still true today .\nIn January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was subjected to a curfew that lasted FIVE months .\nDuring that time , people who were caught outside of their homes after 8 PM were stopped by police and given fines .\nAs days got longer , people had to live with the absurdity of hiding inside their homes while the sun was still up .\nMeanwhile , vaccines were made available .\nPeople were told that these shots would lead to freedom and normality .\nThey were told that a 70 % vaccination rate would be enough to build solid herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were clearly sick and tired of the insane measures they had to deal with , rolled up their sleeves .\nThe province quickly neared a 90 % vaccination rate \u2013 one of the highest in the world .\nSo did Quebec reap the rewards of its compliance ?\nNo .\nDelta arrived .\nAnd , despite the fact that 9 out of 10 people were vaccinated , the government imposed a vaccine passport in most \u201c non-essential public places \u201d such as bars , restaurants , gyms , and much more .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a massive media campaign where nearly all \u201c news \u201d outlets and journalists backed the measure .\nThose who were opposed to it were silenced and censored .\nSo did the passport finally lead Quebec to freedom ?\nNo .\nOnly a few months after this controversial measure was forced on society , Quebec was subjected to another harsh lockdown .\nEverything closed again .\nWhy ?\nOmicron .\nFurthermore , on December 31th 2021 , Quebec became the only place in the world to impose another curfew on the entire population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curfews have an actual impact on the pandemic , the government simply replied that it had no proof .\nA dangerous precedent .\nOn New Year \u2019 s Eve , at 6:45 PM , while people were attempting to forget the fact that they lived in an Orwellian nightmare , every single phone in the province emitted a loud terrifying noise .\nIt was an \u201c emergency alert \u201d sent out by the government stating that \u201c it is forbidden to be outside your home \u201d .\nAs if that wasn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on TV screens with the same horrific noise .\nIt was , easily , the most dystopian moment in Quebec history .\nTo make things worse , the alert actually caused TV service to be interrupted for a few hours due to a \u201c bug \u201d .\nI \u2019 m not making this up .\nIn short , on New Year \u2019 s Eve , people were stuck at home and an Orwellian government alert caused TVs to stop working .\nNeedless to say , 2022 started poorly in Quebec .\nDespite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much weaker than previous variants , Quebec doubled down on the restrictions .\nHere are some of the measures that are currently in effect in Quebec .\nRight now .\n\u2022 All restaurants , bars , and casinos are closed \u2022 All places of worship are closed ( funerals are limited to 25 people ) \u2022 All gyms are closed , extracurricular activities are canceled , most sporting activities are banned \u2022 All schools were closed until January 17th .\nYouth sports are banned .\n\u2022 All spas and saunas are closed \u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schoolchildren as young as 6 years old must wear masks in school at all times , including during phys ed .\nAfter being told that vaccines would lead to freedom and , later , that vaccine passports would lead to freedom \u2013 vaccinated people are still not free .\nAnd unvaccinated people have been living as second-class citizens for months .\nFaced with growing criticism , the government engaged in the most cynical strategy possible : Scapegoating .\nAnd thus , all of the blame was placed on the unvaccinated for taking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as usual , that campaign was backed by some of the worst attempts of propaganda I \u2019 ve ever witnessed .\nIn the following example , a Quebec TV show uses children to push full-on vaccine mandates .\nIn the video , one girl says that the government should \u201c punish \u201d the unvaccinated by gradually ruining their lives .\nAnd that is exactly what is happening now .\nIndeed , the Quebec government is currently going down a highly dangerous road : The imposition of punitive measures .\nUp until 2022 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spread of the virus \u201d .\nHowever , in 2022 , the government introduced additional measures that have absolutely no impact on the spread of the virus .\nThese measures solely exist to punish the unvaccinated for not complying .\nFirst , the government imposed the vaccine passport in all liquor stores and marijuana dispensaries in the province .\nIn Quebec , these businesses are government-owned monopolies .\nTherefore , if you are unvaccinated , you can not buy a bottle of liquor anywhere .\nFurthermore , critics quickly pointed out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Including Pfizer .\nSome days later , the government imposed the vaccine passport in all businesses that are over 1,600 square feet ( except grocery stores and pharmacies ) .\nDespite the fact that they sell groceries and medicine , the unvaccinated are nevertheless banned from Walmart and Costco .\nThey are also banned from all large hardware stores , car dealerships , furniture stores such as Ikea , and much more .\nWhile this measure is meant to \u201c punish \u201d the unvaccinated , it is the fully-compliant vaccinated people who must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and present their QR codes every time they enter .\nBut that \u2019 s not all .\nThe government also announced that the unvaccinated would be subjected to a \u201c health tax \u201d of a substantial amount .\nDespite the fact that Quebec is already one of the most taxed places on earth , it intends to punish the unvaccinated by literally taking more money out of their pockets \u2026 which will be used to oppress them further .\nBut that \u2019 s not all .\nThe government also intends to contact every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to get the injection .\nThis will be done by mail , phone , and even in person .\nThe two measures mentioned above require one important yet disturbing element : The creation of a database of the unvaccinated containing all of their information and attempts at communication .\nQuebec is also leading the way in setting judicial precedents based on vaccination status .\nPlease read the following headline and tell me this is not madness \u2013 especially when one considers the well-known fact that current vaccines do not prevent the spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Quebec , a Canadian province where democracy has been on hold since 2020 and basic freedoms are being removed with no public debates and full media cooperation .\nDespite the fact that professionals are warning of the disastrous effect of these measures on the mental and physical health of the population ( especially young people ) , the measures keep piling on for \u2026 health purposes .\nEven worse , the latest measures have no impact on the pandemic .\nThey exist only to punish the unvaccinated .\nSome places around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , in Austria , mandatory vaccination is underway .\nIt will be enforced by \u201c routine paper checkups \u201d by police .\nThis is what police states do .\nAs the pandemic subsides , people are hoping for the complete disappearance of these measures .\nHowever , some governments are looking to make these betrayals of freedom and democracy permanent .\nIf you live in a place that actually values freedom and democracy , please make sure that things remain that way .\nIf you live in a Covidian nightmare similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell up .", "author": "Vigilant Citizen", "url":

, the city of San Angeles ( born from the merger of Santa Barbara , Los Angeles , and San Diego ) is under the control of Dr. Cocteau , a tyrannical figure who uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect \u201d

on the radio , some people would actually be offended by it .\nThey would request its censorship .\nIn other words , this satirical example of the least offensive song possible would still be considered offensive today .\nWe \u2019 re beyond satire .\nWhile Spartan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he discovers that some people are rebelling against it .\nThe un-chipped rebels in the movie are complete outcasts from society .\nThey are reminiscent of today \u2019 s unvaccinated people who are banned from public places because they have no passports .\nThey are also reminiscent of those today who are vilified because they want the freedoms that existed in the 20th century .\nAt one point , the leader of the rebels tells Spartan : Could this be more relevant today ?\nOf course , Cocteau hates these people .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Cocteau programmed Simon Phoenix to kill the rebels and stop their revolution .\nIn other words , Dr. Cocteau used Phoenix as a mind-controlled patsy to take care of his

How it predicted Arnold Schwarzenegger becoming a politician ; How it predicted people conversing with Alexa/Siri type machines all the time ; How it predicted the use of biometrics and artificial

Canada right now .\nAnd it could be a blueprint to what could happen in several other countries around the world .\nFor weeks , the Canadian government has done everything in its power to turn the Freedom Convoy protests into a national crisis .\nNot only did the government purposely allow the situation to fester , but every single word from Trudeau \u2019 s mouth was purposely calculated to inflame the situation .\nAnd now , instead of presenting Canadians with a plan to restore pre-COVID freedoms , Trudeau went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invoked \u2013 for the first time ever in Canadian history \u2013 the Emergencies Act which opens the door to all-out martial law .\nWas the invocation of the Emergencies Act necessary ?\nNearly all observers say absolutely not .\nIn fact , it appears that this crisis was purposefully engineered to lead to this specific outcome .\nThe main actor in this sad episode in Canadian history ?\nJustin Trudeau .\nIn order to understand the engine and the ideology behind Trudeau , one simply needs to view the following video where Klaus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forum ( WEF ) , talks about \u201c penetrating \u201d the Trudeau government .\nIn the video above , Schwab is \u201c really proud \u201d of controlling a \u201c young generation \u201d of leaders such as Trudeau .\nHe even adds that at least half of Trudeau \u2019 s cabinet is owned by the WEF .\nThis is not a \u201c conspiracy theory \u201d , this is Schwab himself telling it like it is .\nIn the past months , I \u2019 ve posted several articles about the WEF and its plans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Great Reset \u201d .\nThe WEF even posted some truly bizarre videos praising drastic lockdowns while attempting to normalize permanent pandemic measures .\nWhen one understands that the Trudeau government is completely controlled by the WEF , his attitude and policies start making sense .\nIndeed , when Trudeau was first elected in 2015 , he was all about \u201c sunny ways \u201d and uniting Canadians with a positive message .\nHowever , since the pandemic , his message took a drastic turn .\nIt is reflective of an agenda that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large portion of citizens into enemies of the state , which justifies repression against them .\nSadly , the pandemic , which is supposedly a \u201c health crisis \u201d , has turned into a political crisis .\nreport this adDespite the fact that Canada has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world , Trudeau has been hard at work driving a wedge in the country and demonizing those who did not get vaccinated .\nA few months ago , Trudeau infamously called the unvaccinated \u201c misogynists and racists \u201d .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie .\nHow can the unvaccinated be \u201c misogynists \u201d when half of them are women ?\nHow can they be \u201c racists \u201d when minorities and immigrants show the lowest vaccination rates in the country ?\nIn this toxic context , facts do not matter .\nIt is about throwing buzzwords and creating a narrative justifying oppression .\nIn January of 2022 , while places around the world were dropping COVID measures that were deemed outdated and unnecessary , the Trudeau government imposed a vaccine mandate to truckers going through the Canada-USA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those measures that have no purpose except driving a wedge in society .\nHow can truckers , who spend most of their time on highways , inside of trucks , be deemed a COVID threat ?\nFurthermore , the Omicron variant proved , without the shadow of a doubt , that the current vaccines do not stop the spread of the virus .\nConsidering these facts , one can ask : Why did the government choose to enforce this unnecessary policy ?\nWas it a pure provocation ?\nSo truckers responded by organizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country to gather in Ottawa .\nThe convoy apparently struck a nerve in COVID-exhausted Canada as it got a heroes \u2019 welcome everywhere it went .\nSeeing this massive movement gaining steam , did Trudeau attempt to nip it in the bud by opening a dialogue ?\nNo , he did the exact opposite .\nIn an infamous press conference , Trudeau said : Trudeau actually said that Canadian citizens who were against vaccine mandates held \u201c unacceptable views \u201d .\nBill Maher \u2013 a staunch liberal \u2013 compared Trudeau to Hitler .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full lockdown , Trudeau posted a tweet thanking truckers .\nAs soon as the truckers opposed one of Trudeau \u2019 s oppressive policies , they \u2019 ve turned into a \u201c fringe minority with unacceptable views \u201d .\nWhen the convoy finally arrived in Ottawa , thousands upon thousands of Canadians protested peacefully against vaccine mandates and other COVID restrictions .\nThis situation could have de-escalated very easily .\nTrudeau could have met with the protestors .\nA few months prior , he literally knelt down to BLM protestors who were tearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have announced the gradual lifting of contentious measures which shouldn \u2019 t even exist in the first place .\nThese simple gestures would have diffused the situation and most protestors would have packed their things and gone home .\nThose who remained would have shown bad faith .\nHowever , Trudeau did none of those things .\nOn the day prior to the Ottawa protest , Trudeau tweeted this .\nThen , he fled and went into hiding to an \u201c undisclosed location \u201d for several days .\nMeanwhile , media outlets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globalist forces that own Trudeau ) did everything in their power to demonize the protestors .\nAs usual , the words \u201c racist \u201d and \u201c white supremacist \u201d were thrown freely , despite the fact that a great number of protestors were minorities and immigrants .\nOnce again , facts did not matter .\nIt was about pushing a narrative .\nIn short , the powers that be wanted the situation to escalate and they wanted protestors to radicalize by needlessly provoking them .\nThis bizarre attitude caused members of Trudeau \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nJoel Lightbound , a member of Trudeau \u2019 s cabinet stated : While members of Trudeau \u2019 s own party denounced his dangerous and divisive tactics , opposition parties attempted to resolve the situation by proposing a timeline for lifting COVID restrictions .\nThis simple gesture would have been enough to send most truckers home .\nHowever , Trudeau \u2019 s government rejected this motion .\nWhy ?\nThe answer soon became obvious .\nThey wanted to turn the Freedom Convoy into a political crisis .\nAfter 17 days of complete inaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option possible : Martial law .\nOn February 14th , the Trudeau government enacted \u2013 for the first time ever in Canadian history \u2013 the Emergencies Act which gives the government sweeping powers .\nThis extreme measure was meant to be used in case of a dire national emergency : Nothing about the Freedom convoy requires the enactment of the Emergency Act .\nThe protests were overwhelmingly peaceful .\nOn the other hand , a few blockades at the Canada-USA border did prevent traffic from flowing freely .\nHowever , nearly all observers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to address these activities that were deemed illegal .\nBut none of these tools were used .\nThe situation was allowed to fester .\nWhile Trudeau states that the Emergencies Act was necessary , the prime ministers of several provinces , including Quebec , Alberta , Manitoba , and Saskatchewan all opposed its invocation .\nThe Emergencies Act gives the federal government special powers including : During the press conference , Trudeau stressed the fact that the Act would be \u201c limited in time and targeted to specific geographical regions \u201d .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be used against the public .\nHowever , Trudeau had also stated in the past that there would never be vaccine mandates in Canada .\nBut here we are .\nMore importantly , despite the words that were said during the press conference , the government nevertheless opened that legal door .\nBizarre fact : The only time martial law was declared in Canada was in 1970 and it was invoked Trudeau \u2019 s father \u2013 Pierre Elliot Trudeau .\nThe invocation of the Emergencies Act also came with new sweeping financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : In short , the Emergencies Act came with provisions regarding crowdfunding \u2013 a new precedent that will undoubtedly be imitated across the world .\nPeople from all sides of the political spectrum were baffled by Trudeau \u2019 s bizarre and irrational response to the trucker crisis .\nWhile some accuse him of \u201c lack of leadership \u201d , the truth goes way beyond a character flaw .\nTrudeau is actually backed by the most powerful leaders in the world .\nHe does not decide anything .\nKlaus Schwab himself stated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government .\nThe trucker crisis was purposely engineered to reach an impasse in order to justify the invocation of the Emergencies Act .\nAfter two years of COVID-policies that tested the limits of freedom and democracy , the Canadian government now took things to yet another level .\nNearly all observers agree that the threshold required for the invocation of the Emergencies Act ( endangerment of Canadians or national sovereignty ) was not crossed .\nFar from it .\nHowever , like most COVID measures of the past , a precedent is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeping powers has been lowered .\nIf the Emergencies Act can be invoked to stop a bunch of truckers from protesting , it can be used for anything .\nThe WEF wanted this to

sickness through popular culture .\nIn one single picture , Cruz Beckham accomplished all of this .\nHis mommy was so proud that she posted it on Instagram .\nThis picture of a teenage @ @ @ @ @ @ @

series .\nOf course , they \u2019 re right .\nThis picture is basically SPOTM 101 .\nHowever , there is so much going on in this pic ( and the entire photoshoot ) that I had to dedicate an entire article to it .\nNot because Cruz really matters , but because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sums up the sacrifices required to enter the industry .\nSo here \u2019 s a complete breakdown of this picture .\nTo fully understand the minding behind it , we must first look at the person behind it .\nSteven Klein is one of the elite \u2019 s favorite fashion photographers .\nHis works were featured on this site countless times because they consistently contain all of the symbolism and the obsessions of the occult elite .\nFor instance , Klein directed Lady Gaga \u2019 s video Alejandro , which I analyzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featured some of the main themes in Klein \u2019 s works : Homoeroticism , satanism , and a whole lot of one-eye signs ( which basically means fsubmission to the occult elite ) .\nLike many other industry insiders , Klein \u2019 s Instagram account is filled with bizarre posts which appear to be hinting at some of the sick past times of the occult elite .\nThroughout the years , Klein worked with the biggest stars in the world and his photoshoots never fail to contain symbolism that is too obvious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photoshoot with Justin Bieber has lots in common with the Cruz Beckham photos .\nWhen one understands the mindset behind Klein \u2019 s works ( and the occult elite in general ) , the meaning behind Cruz Beckham \u2019 s photoshoot becomes clearer \u2026 and more disturbing .\nThe Beckhams clearly want to see Cruz follow in the footsteps of Justin Bieber ( who is apparently his \u201c idol \u201d ) .\nTo do so , they \u2019 ve hired Poo Bear \u2013 one of Bieber \u2019 s songwriters .\nA marketing machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a photoshoot by Steven Klein for i-D magazine .\nBut there was more to this photoshoot than mere publicity .\nIt was about his initiation into an industry bent on child abuse , exploitation , and submission .\nAs said above , this picture is SPOTM 101 .\nFirst , at the time of taking this picture , Cruz was 16 years old .\nAnd Steven Klein , who is known for homoerotic pictures and videos , found it appropriate to have Cruz posing with his pants literally pulled down .\nThis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of minors in the industry .\nThen , there \u2019 s the butterfly tattoo .\nMany noted that it was illegal for minors to get tattoos in the UK .\nThat is true , but there is more to it .\nIn the entertainment industry , butterflies ( especially Monarch butterflies ) are references to Monarch programming \u2013 an offshoot of MKULTRA .\nAs explained in my article about it , Monarch mind control turns people into mental slaves using a process of intense trauma ( which includes sexual abuse ) and dissociation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that context in mind , the words \u201c out of body \u201d at the bottom of the picture become a creepy reference to dissociation .\nIndeed , under intense trauma , the minds of MK slaves dissociate from the body that is suffering as a defense mechanism .\nThen , there \u2019 s the pink hair .\nThe choice of color is not random .\nIt is perfectly in line with the elite \u2019 s agenda of feminizing men \u2013 especially those in the music industry .\nIn fact , I wouldn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wears a dress in the near future .\nFurthermore , celebrities who recently underwent MK programming often emerge with shaved heads and colored hair .\nOf course , this entire mess of a picture is crowned with a massive one-eye sign which clearly indicates that this is all about the occult elite \u2019 s agenda \u2013 and nothing else .\nI don \u2019 t normally dedicate an entire article to a single picture but this one deserved an in-depth explanation .\nCruz Beckham is an heir of celebrity royalty , the son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two monarchs have ascended to the top of the celebrity ladder decades ago , and they \u2019 ve remained at the top with constant media exposure .\nNow , Cruz is the next generation of the Beckham lineage .\nAnd , like many other children of celebrities , he \u2019 s being pushed into the spotlight .\nHowever , that spotlight comes at a cost .\nThere needs to be an initiation and there needs to be a sacrifice .\nIndeed , that fabled spotlight is

reeked .\nEvery time , for years afterwards when I looked at the 10 by 8 transparencies , the stench came straight back to me as pungent as if each image was saturated with it .\nThat , I concluded was death .\nThis is all rather messed up and disgusting .\nHowever , the picture perfectly fits with the main theme of the EAZY video : Death .\nConsidering the fact that Kanye has been outspoken about Christianity in the past years ( he \u2019 s been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does the burning church represent ?\nSome lines in his verse express the fact that the sentiments in this song are rather un-Christian .\nThen , Kanye appears .\nOr maybe his alter-persona .\nIn the past months , Kanye has been seen walking around in public with creepy masks and strange \u201c punishment haircuts \u201d .\nAll of this strangeness points to mind control .\nThis creepy version of Kanye is really mad at Pete Davidson \u2013 the new boyfriend of Kim Kardashian .\nBefore going further , we need to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete Davidson is a strange presence in the entertainment industry .\nThroughout the years , he dated several famous women and most of them share the same profile : They \u2019 re all deep in the industry , often since a young age .\nFor instance , Davidson dated Cazzie David , the daughter of Larry David \u2013 the creator of the hit shows Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm .\nThen , he famously dated Ariana Grande who is an ex-Disney child star turned industry pawn .\nThen , he dated Margaret Qualley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacDowell .\nThen he went out with a very young Kaia Gerber \u2013 the daughter of supermodel Cindy Crawford .\nIn short , Davidson is an \u201c industry insider \u201d who navigates from one high-profile relationship to another .\nKim Kardashian \u2019 s relationship with Davidson became public shortly after the deadly Astroworld fiasco .\nThat disastrous event starred Travis Scott ( the boyfriend of Kylie Jenner ) and ended up being a PR nightmare for the Kardashian clan .\nRumors quickly emerged that the Kim Kardashian/Pete Davidson relationship was \u201c fake \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also believes so .\nKim \u2019 s relationship with Pete Davidson appears to be custom-made to drive Kanye crazy .\nIn a January 2022 interview , Ye revealed that he was stopped from entering Kardashian \u2019 s home to visit his kids by security because Davidson was in the house .\nUsually , a \u201c noncustodial parent \u201d does not have legal physical custody over their child resulting from a court order .\nWhile this information was never officially released to the public , Kanye strongly implies that he \u2019 s been cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he truly bought the house next door to the Kardashians .\nBecause that \u2019 s the point of being rich .\nSo , in EAZY , Davidson is buried up to his head .\nKanye then sprinkles some rose seeds on Pete and waters him thoroughly .\nThat scene actually happened in real life a few weeks prior to the release of the video .\nUpon watching the video , the roses take on a creepy meaning : The roses actually grew from Pete Davidson \u2019 s rotting corpse .\nSo romantic .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ video , Kanye raps : Kanye believes that the Illuminati ( aka the occult elite ) is \u201c mad \u201d at him and is trying to destroy him .\nIs it because he accused Kris Jenner of pimping her daughters and the Kardashians of trying to destroy him ?\nIs it because he \u2019 s been outspoken about Christianity and conservative values ?\nIn a recent Instagram post ( which was later deleted ) , Kanye explains the conspiracy against him which involves Pete Davidson ( whom Kanye derogatorily calls \u201c Skete \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line about \u201c Illuminati mad \u201d , Kanye raps : What is Numinati ?\nThe name appears to combine the words \u201c new \u201d and \u201c Illuminati \u201d .\nIs it some sort of anti-Illuminati collective of artists ?\nIs it simply a clothing brand ?\nNot quite sure yet .\nHowever , The Game ( who raps the first verse on EAZY ) posted this on Instagram : The EAZY video ends with text saying \u201c Everyone lived happily ever after \u201d .\nThe video ends with another frame saying \u201c JK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not prevent a slew of celebrities from being angry about the vaguely threatening message of this video .\nYup , Kanye did it again , he got a bunch of people riled up .\nMostly himself .\nThroughout the years , I \u2019 ve published numerous articles about Kanye because he \u2019 s a clear example of a male artist tangled in the dark side of the music industry .\nFrom his mother \u2019 s wholesome values to the demonic influence of the occult elite , there \u2019 s a duality in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is constantly prevalent in everything he does .\nPart of his work appears to be rebelling against the elite while another part is completely in line with it .\nIndeed , while Kanye inherited his mother \u2019 s Christian faith , his dealings with the occult elite birthed in him a twisted and mutated version of Christianity that was expressed in the album Donda .\nEAZY is a continuation of this theme .\nWhile he talks about making the \u201c Illuminati mad \u201d , EAZY is nevertheless drenched in the dark energy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he \u2019 s not an industry puppet , I can still see strings attached to him .\nCut them off Kanye !",

that \u2019 s a vagina house and it was built to lure thirsty men .\nHowever , there \u2019 s a catch .\nThe entrance has \u201c teeth \u201d ( which are actually made of human legs ) .\nThis image is a reference to the ancient and archetypal ( which means \u201c embedded in the collective unconscious \u201d ) symbol known as \u201c vagina dentata \u201d .\nFound in the folk tales of various

Fighters released a horror-comedy movie called Studio 666 .\nThe subject of the movie ?\nMembers of the Foo Fighters get killed as blood sacrifices for the demonic music industry .\nreport this adWatching this movie now is a surreal experience .\nNot only does it blatantly expose the occult mindset of the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder of Taylor Hawkins by a demon-possessed Dave Grohl .\nHere \u2019 s a look at the movie .\nThe premise of the movie is quite simple : Dave Grohl wants to do something different for the Foo Fighters \u2019 tenth album .\nSo the band \u2019 s manager Jeremy Shill ( interesting last name ) sends them to a mansion in Encino , California to record their album .\nHowever , the band members are unaware of the mansion \u2019 s grisly history : In the 1990s , members of a band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the band moves inside the mansion , Dave Grohl discovers a basement filled with satanic objects and becomes possessed by a demon .\nSoon after , Grohl \u2019 s writer \u2019 s block is replaced with intense musical inspiration .\nIf you know a bit about occult symbolism , you instantly recognized this symbol : A unicursal hexagram .\nAlthough that symbol is quite ancient , it was popularized by the most famous occultist of the 20th century , Aleister Crowley ( read my article about him here ) .\nCrowley was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have been extremely influential to the occult elite : The Golden Dawn and the Ordo Templi Orientis ( O.T.O. )\n.\nThe influence of these organizations on the entertainment industry can not be understated .\nAs explained in previous articles on this site , these organizations are the forces behind the occult mega-rituals that randomly punctuate world events .\nIn my article about the Son of Sam , I cite several sources explaining that these murders were actually blood sacrifices carried out by cult members following Crowleyan teachings , under the influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn short , the presence of this symbol in Studio 666 is not random .\nIt is extremely deliberate and points to real occult concepts to which countless members of the elite feverishly adhere .\nAs Dave Grohl becomes increasingly demonic , he starts killing his bandmembers in the most gruesome ways possible .\nWhile the rest of the band still doesn \u2019 t understand what \u2019 s going on , a neighbor of the mansion sends them a secret message .\nWe soon understand that these murders are literal blood sacrifices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c the book \u201d .\nThe neighbor explains that the book was rumored to hold the secret incantations of Aleister Crowley and it requires blood to keep the occult power going .\nMeanwhile , Grohl is set on finishing a song titled Lacrimus de Ebrius which means Tears of God ( a very satanic title ) .\nSo he pushes Taylor Hawkins to outdo himself while recording the drum track .\nAfterward , the remaining band members attempt to save Grohl by performing an exorcism .\nThe ritual appears to work and Grohl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the band \u2019 s manager Jeremy Shill and the real estate developer ambush the remaining members ( while wearing black robes ) and reveal that they planned the whole thing .\nWith all of the Foo Fighters gone except Dave Grohl , Shill starts talking .\nAnd the things he says are just \u2026 facts .\nThis speech didn \u2019 t really need to be in the movie .\nIt was a blatant message from the occult elite to the masses .\nAfter this passionate speech , Shill realizes that Grohl is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie ends with a possessed Grohl about to perform for thousands of adoring fans .\nThe moral of the story : Those who last in the industry sold their souls .\nIn 2014 , Taylor Hawkins formed a group called Birds of Satan .\nIn 2022 , he starred in a movie called Studio 666 where he gets killed as a blood sacrifice .\nOne month after the release of that movie , Hawkins dies in bizarre circumstances .\nOn the day of his death , Dave Grohl \u2019 s concept album Dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s all about occult rituals and blood sacrifices .\nWas Hawkins \u2019 death planned from the get-go ?\nDifficult to say .\nHowever , as explained in my article about Poltergeist , movies with strong demonic themes are often \u201c cursed \u201d and are followed by the bizarre deaths of people who participated in them .\nThe forces and the symbols displayed in Studio 666 are not fictional , they are real .\nFurthermore , they are connected to real rituals and real sacrifices that have been happening for centuries , often around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd maybe that \u2019 s exactly what happened on March 25th .", "author": "Vigilant Citizen", "url":

16th century .\nShe was beautiful , highly educated and she spoke several languages .\nShe lived in lavish castles .\nHer family lineage was illustrious and owned land in the Kingdom of Hungary .\nShe was the niece of Stephen Bathory , the king of Poland , the grand duke of Lithuania , and the prince of Transylvania .\nShe did good deeds for local peasants who admired her .\nIn short , she had everything going for her .\nThen , rumors began circulating that she was a vampiric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her castle .\nLater , these rumors were proven true \u2026 and then some .\nIn fact , Bathory \u2019 s cruelty and depravity were so shocking that they inspired legends that we still hear about today .\nKnown as the \u201c Blood Countess \u201d or \u201c Countess Dracula \u201d , Bathory holds the Guinness record for \u201c most prolific female murderer in the Western world \u201d .\nShe is alleged to have killed over 600 virgins in order to drink their blood and bathe in it , ostensibly to

changed .\nBathory was born in Transylvania in 1560 .\nShe was the product of inbreeding between Baron George Bathory and Baroness Anna Bathory .\nHer family included kings , cardinals , knights , and judges .\nIt also included cruel , violent , and deranged psychopaths .\nDuring her childhood , Bathory witnessed numerous acts of cruelty committed by her family .\nFrom a young age , Bathory was surrounded by people with dark interests .\nAt the age of 15 , Bathory was married to Count Ferenc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The arranged marriage turned out to be a good match as both of them had heavy sadistic tendencies .\nNot unlike today \u2019 s elite , Elizabeth knew how to hide her family \u2019 s dark side with good deeds .\nTo please Elizabeth , her husband reportedly built a torture chamber to her

.\nPeasant girls from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seen again .\nSome were handed over by trusting parents who were eager to gain favor with the countess .\nOnce in Bathory \u2019 s castle , the girls were

accomplish , just so she could torture someone .\nBut rebukes and slaps were for sissies .\nIf a girl was suspected of theft , she was commanded to strip naked and was then tortured by the application of red-hot coins pressed against her bare skin .\nSometimes the countess opted to go organic ; The girls were whipped with stinging nettles after being beat with some other device .\nAnd even if a servant girl hadn \u2019 t misbehaved she might still end up as the day \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menu .\nGirls were placed into cages fitted with internal spikes that impaled them everywhere as the cage tightened , resulting in agonizing and bloody death .\nPincers and tongs , heated until they glowed , were used to tear off bits of flesh .\nScalding irons branded their tender skin .\nErzs\u00e9bet even perfected a technique of tearing a girl \u2019 s head apart by tugging the sides of her mouth until they ripped and her neck snapped in two .\nThe countess was said to have achieved sexual exstasy during these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the sights and sounds of her victim \u2019 s agony .\nShe enjoyed whipping them from the front , just so she could see the pain and terror on their faces .\nSometimes , for kicks and giggles Erzs\u00e9bet would slather a girl with honey and tie her to a tree , leaving her to the mercy of insects and other wildlife with a sweet tooth.\n\u201d \u2013 Ibid .\nWhen her husband died , Elisabeth took things to another level .\nFrom a young age , Bathory was obsessed with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the mirror while mumbling strange incantations .\nAfter her husband \u2019 s death , Bathory became a single mother of eight in her forties .\nAnd she was willing to do anything to preserve her youthful looks .\nAnything .\n\u201c Erzs\u00e9bet now convinced herself that torture and mutilation had an additional , and healthful , benefit .\nOne day , a hapless servant accidentally pulled the countess \u2019 s hair while she was drawing a section of her

called herself Darvulia ( real name Anna ) , and was known as \u201c the witch of the forest , \u201d had by then become one of Erzs\u00e9bet \u2019 s cohorts .\nDarvulia suggested to the countess that bathing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficial as a fountain of youth .\nSo Erzs\u00e9bet lured as many peasant girls as she could to Castle Csejthe , as well as to her other properties , including a town

.\nAccounts of the raid are nothing less than horrifying .\nDuring Bathory \u2019 s trial , testimonies from witnesses , accomplices , and survivors horrified the judges .\nInside her castle , authorities found a ledger containing the names of over 600 victims .\nAs the search went on , bodies were discovered everywhere on the premises , from shallow graves to hidden chambers inside the castle .\nDespite the overwhelming proof against Bathory , she was relatively spared .\nWhile her accomplices were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bathory did not attend the trial and was not executed .\nAfter four years of confinement in her castle , died at the age of 54 .\nThe story of Elizabeth Bathory was nearly erased from history .\nIt easily could have morphed into a fictionalized legend , like many other stories involving the occult elite .\nHer trial was held in secret in a remote Slovakian town in 1611 and her powerful family immediately sealed its records .\nThere were no newspapers to report on it .\nNone of the ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released to public scrutiny .\nElizabeth was not even allowed to appear at the trial .\nInstead of public execution , she was walled in alive inside one of her remote castles .\nIn many ways , Bathory \u2019 s life and downfall are highly reminiscent of a modern equivalent : Jeffrey Epstein .\nLike Epstein , Bathory had connections with some of the world \u2019 s most powerful people .\nAnd , like Epstein , Bathory lured young girls with promises of wealth and prestige .\nHowever , like Epstein , Bathory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumors across the land .\nHer

.\nAlthough she clearly struggles with her addiction , the series manages to present her experiences in an insidiously intriguing light .\nAt the beginning of the series , Rue states that she suffers

appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importantly , she \u2019 s making money .\nIn fact , the show explains exactly how Kat can get paid anonymously by using cryptocurrency .\nThe show keeps encouraging minors to

\u2019 s answer was rather vague and evasive .\nThat \u2019 s because the truth would probably upset Glamour magazine readers .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ll let you put together the pieces of this very easy puzzle .\nIn short , Barker and Kardashian are afflicted with the same sickness as Megan Fox and MGK .\nAnd Armie Hammer .\nAnd Elizabeth Bathory .\nAnd many others .\nIn the Glamour interview , Megan Fox \u2019 s blood ritual revelations were preceded and followed by a whole lot of Hollywood virtual signaling .\nIndeed , Fox began by talking about how she was a \u201c feminist icon who fought the patriarchy \u201d and so forth .\nThis generic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about literally DRINKING BLOOD as if it was not COMPLETELY INSANE .\nThe interview went on to discuss Fox \u2019 s son Noah who has been wearing dresses since he was two years old .\nTWO .\nFox went on to explain that she bought books written by \u201c transgender children \u201d to talk about this stuff to her son .\nHollywood witchery and sons wearing dresses go hand in hand .\nAsk Madonna .\nMegan Fox literally said that she partakes in blood rituals with her boyfriend who happens to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know about the entertainment industry ?\nThese people are completely sick .\nAnd that \u2019 s only the tip of the iceberg .\nIn these circles , the blood of children is deemed more potent .\nBut I guess that

, the English singer and songwriter released five albums to critical acclaim while winning industry trophies .\nHowever , despite her relative success , Charlie XCX still could not be called a \u201c major pop star \u201d .\nIndeed , the proverbial spotlight did not shine on Charli as intensely as others pop stars .\nSo what was missing ?\nLooks ?\nTalent ?\nHard work ?\nNo .\nShe had to sell her soul to the devil .\nAnd not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she did .\nIn occult circles , the initiation of a candidate involves a symbolic death and rebirth .\nThis is exactly what Charli \u2019 s album Crash is about .\nUpon the release of Crash , a slew of music videos was released .\nTwo of them stand out from the lot and they happen to be highly symbolic .\nHere \u2019 s a look at them .\nThe lyrics of the single Good Ones are about Charli wanting to end a healthy relationship because she craves evilness .\nThese lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song appears to be about Charli being attracted to bad boys , the video indicates that the \u201c relationship \u201d Charli refers to is actually \u2026 spiritual .\nThe entire video takes place at a funeral with people mourning and stuff .\nThen Charli emerges with her witch coven or something .\nSatanic black masses are all about the reversal and perversion of Christian rituals and symbols .\nEnshrining the guy who pierced Jesus instead of Jesus himself is a good example .\nIn short , Good Ones is all celebration of death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you believe I \u2019 m going a little far with this interpretation ritual , you should maybe check the alternative video .\nGood Ones is about Charli \u2019 s symbolic death and pending rebirth as a pawn of the music industry .\nThe video Beg For You appears to continue in this ritualistic narrative .\nThe lyrics of Beg For You are about longing for someone who is kind of a jerk .\nOf course , the video is about a ritualistic initiation that includes drinking blood .\nBecause , after letting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Sawayama are ready to take their careers to another level .\nBut first , they have to partake in weird , ritualistic crap .\nThe Beg For You video is all about that .\nThe coven is led to a place where something unholy is about to happen .\nI hope you \u2019 ve been noticing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about its obsession with drinking human blood .\nThe initiation ritual is complete and another crappy video is released to the world .\nAfter years of hard work in the music industry with albums leaning towards innovation and experimentation , Charli XCX wanted to go mainstream .\nSo she made mainstream music .\nMore importantly , she complied with the industry \u2019 s requirements of selling her soul and pushing a sick agenda .\nThe result is Crash \u2013 an album surrounded by over-the-top Illuminati madness .\nSome might argue that Charli \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is actually satirical , a second-degree comment on the state of the industry .\nThat might be a way of seeing things .\nHowever , the end result is the same : Through her works , Charli propagates in popular culture the same messages , the same symbolism , and the same satanic \u201c energy \u201d as others .\nWith that being said , did the soul-selling work out for Charli ?\nAt first glance , yes .\nShe \u2019 s enjoying that sweet mass media attention .\nBut was it worth it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s own

people \u2019 s minds .\nAppropriately enough , a recent recruitment video by the 4th PSYOP Group accomplished just that .\nPosted on the official social media accounts associated with the U.S. Military , the video titled Ghosts in the Machine gained some viral traction as viewers were impressed with the video \u2019 s production quality \u2026 while being baffled by its overarching message and symbolism .\nWhat does it all mean ?\nTo better understand this video , let \u2019 s look at the fascinating yet secretive world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological operations \u201d .\nIt can be defined as : When books describe PSYOPS , they often refer to WWI-era strategies such as dropping leaflets from a plane to demoralize the enemy .\nThat era is long gone .\nPSYOPS moved way beyond these primitive methods to adopt highly sophisticated techniques utilizing the latest technologies and the immense power of mass media .\nBut that is not all .\nThere was always a \u201c magical \u201d , supernatural element to PSYOPS .\nThese allusions to magic are not merely figurative .\nPSYOPS extensively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ESP ( extra-sensory perception ) and remote viewing .\nThis symbiotic relationship between PSYOPS and the occult is fully personified by an important yet controversial figure : Michael Aquino .\nMichael Aquino joined the U.S. Army in 1968 where he became an officer specializing in psychological warfare and , later , a Lieutenant colonel in military intelligence .\nAs Aquino climbed the ranks of the U.S. military , he also climbed the ranks of another organization : The Church of Satan .\nAs years passed , the relationship between Aquino and LaVey deteriorated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Satan was a symbolic force while Aquino believed in the literal existence of Satan .\nIn 1975 , Aquino founded the Temple of Set \u2013 an occult order that revolved around an Egyptian deity on whom the Hebraic Satan was supposedly based .\nAquino \u2019 s occult activities did not interfere with his military career .\nIn fact , he described politics and propaganda as forms of \u201c lesser black magic \u201d .\nIn 1980 , as a \u201c PSYOP Research & Analysis Team Leader \u201d , Aquino c0-authored MindWar \u2013 an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of psychological operations .\nWhile this document was only intended for the eyes of government policymakers , it accidentally became public .\nAnd it caused quite a stir .\nThe least one can say is that MindWar was visionary .\nIt accurately predicted the 4th generation of warfare which focuses on bypassing armies in order to \u201c attack population , culture , and institutions \u201d .\nAnd the best way to accomplish this was , of course , through mass media .\n\u201c In its strategic context , MindWar must reach out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the globe \u2013 neither through primitive \u201c battlefield \u201d leaflets and loudspeakers of PSYOP nor through the weak , imprecise , and narrow effort of psychotronics \u2013 but through the media possessed by the United States which have the capabilities to reach virtually all people on the face of the Earth .\nThese media are , of course , the electronic media \u2013 television and radio .\nState of the art developments in satellite communication , video recording techniques , and laser and optical transmission of broadcasts make possible a penetration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been inconceivable just a few years ago.\n\u201d \u2013 Michael A. Aquino and Paul E. Valley , \u201c MindWar \u201d The ultimate goal of MindWar is to make people willingly do what they \u2019 re supposed to do , while not realizing they \u2019 ve been pushed towards that decision at every step of the way .\nTowards the end of this short document , Aquino goes way beyond mass media .\nHe states that PSYOPS must make full use of phenomenons such as electromagnetic fields and Extremely Low-Frequency Waves ( ELFs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MindWar .\n\u201c There are some purely natural conditions under which minds may become more or less receptive to ideas , and MindWar should take full advantage of such phenomena as atmospheric activity , air ionization and extremely low frequency waves.\n\u201d ELF waves up to 100Hz are naturally occurring , but they can be produced artificially ( such as for the Navy \u2019 s Project Sanguine for submarine communication ) .\nELF-waves are not normally noticed by the unaided senses , yet their resonant effect upon the human body has been connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nInfrasound vibration ( up to 20 Hz ) can subliminally influence brain activity to align itself to delta , theta , alpha or beta wave patterns , inclining an audience toward everything from alterness to passivity .\nInfrasound could be used tactically , as ELF-waves endure for great distances ; and it could be used in conjunction with media broadcasts as well.\n\u201d \u2013 Ibid .\nYou \u2019 ve read correctly : Aquino stated that ELFs can be used in conjunction with media broadcasts .\nWith all of that being said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this PSYOP recruitment video .\nThe recruitment video by the 4th PSYOP Group revolves around the saying \u201c All the world \u2019 s a stage \u201d \u2013 a quote from William Shakepesear which compares the world to a play and people to actors .\nHowever , in the context of PYSOP , this quote takes on a deeper meaning : Many of the events we see around the world are staged and choreographed by unseen puppet masters .\nAppropriately enough , the video begins with the words : This creepy figure appears throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his silhouette looks familiar .\nThe video subtly hints at the various \u201c battlefields \u201d of PYSOP using clever shots .\nThe message of this highly symbolic image : Your ridiculous entertainers are actually agents of propaganda .\nThe message of these scenes : These events did not happen organically , they were the result of psychological warfare .\nAs Aquino wrote : Ghosts in the Machine is a cleverly made recruitment video that appears to target a specific audience : \u201c Conspiracy-minded \u201d people \u2026 who want to take part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the video explains how the 4th PSYOP Group uses psychological warfare to defend American interests in foreign conflicts \u2013 especially those involving China and Russia .\nWith that being said , a vital question begs to be asked : Is psychological warfare used against American citizens and allied countries ?\nAt the time of PSYOP \u2019 s inception , laws were created to prevent the military from conducting psychological warfare on U.S. citizens .\nHowever , Aquino himself observed that the 2003 Iraq invasion was preceded by an \u201c extreme MindWar on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible that the 4th PSYOP Group is focused on foreign adversaries , psychological warfare is currently being used by all kinds of state and non-state actors .\nIn the 21st century , globalist forces control mass media and political parties .\nAs such , this powerful elite group has been conducting an unprecedented MindWar effort to \u201c attack population , culture , and institutions \u201d .\nIt is happening right before our eyes .", "author": "Vigilant Citizen", "url":

Creepiest and Most Dystopian Things Pushed by the World Economic Forum (WEF)", "content": "When one talks about the \u201c global elite \u201d , one usually refers to a small group of wealthy and powerful individuals who operate beyond national borders .\nThrough various organizations , these non-elected individuals gather in semi-secrecy to decide policies they want to see applied on a global level .\nThe World Economic Forum ( WEF ) is smack dab in the middle of it all .\nIndeed , through its annual Davos meetings , the WEF attempts to legitimize and normalize its influence on the world \u2019 s democratic nations by having a panel of world leaders attending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple look at the list of attendees at these meetings reveals the organization \u2019 s incredible reach and influence .\nThe biggest names in media , politics , business , science , technology , and finance are represented at the WEF .\nAccording to mass media , the Davos meetings gather people to discuss issues such as \u201c inequality , climate change , and international cooperation \u201d .\nThis simplistic description appears to be custom-made to cause the average citizen to yawn in boredom .\nBut topics at the WEF go much further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , people at the WEF have said some highly disturbing things , none of which garnered proper media attention .\nIn fact , when one pieces together the topics championed by the WEF , an overarching theme emerges : The total control of humanity using media , science , and technology while reshaping democracies to form a global government .\nIf this sounds like a far-fetched conspiracy theory , keep reading .\nHere are the 10 most dystopian things that are being pushed by the WEF right now .\nThis list sorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they \u2019 re all equally crazy .\nThe least one can say is that Klaus Schwab , the founder and the head of the WEF is not a fan of democracy .\nIn fact , he perceives it as an obstacle to a fully globalized world .\nIn the 2010 WEF report titled \u201c Global Redesign \u201d , Schwab postulates that a globalized world is best managed by a \u201c self-selected coalition of multinational corporations , governments ( including through the UN system ) , and select civil society organizations ( CSOs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a democracy .\nHe argued that governments are no longer \u201c the overwhelmingly dominant actors on the world stage \u201d and that \u201c the time has come for a new stakeholder paradigm of international governance \u201d .\nFor this reason , the Transnational Institute ( TNI ) described the WEF as \u201c a silent global coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat \u201d to capture governance .\nreport this adIn 2017 , at Harvard \u2019 s John F. Kennedy School of Government , Schwab blatantly admitted what is continually dismissed as a \u201c conspiracy theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is \u201c penetrating \u201d governments around the world .\nIn this outstanding talk , Schwab blatantly stated that Angela Merkel of Germany , Vladimir Putin of Russia , Justin Trudeau of Canada , and Emmanuel Macron of France were \u201c groomed \u201d by the WEF .\nHe even adds that at least half of Canada \u2019 s cabinet consists of representatives sold to the WEF \u2019 s agenda .\nThis is not a conspiracy theory .\nThis is the absolute truth , confirmed by the head of the WEF himself .\nIn 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the WEF was \u201c Mind Control Using Sound Waves \u201d ( read my full article about it here ) .\nI did not alter this title for sensationalism , those are exactly the words used by the WEF .\nIn the article , the technology is touted as a possible treatment for Parkinson \u2019 s and Alzheimer \u2019 s disease .\nHowever , the article also states that \u201c it can cure you , it can get you addicted , and it can kill you \u201d .\nIt can also be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , remotely .\nThe article states : The conclusion of the article : Nobody can stop scientists from developing this technology .\nTo prevent misuse , it should be regulated by organizations such as \u2026 the WEF .\nThat \u2019 s convenient because some companies developing this technology are part of the WEF .\nDo you see where this is going ?\nOnce again , this title sounds like a far-fetched conspiracy theory cleverly worded for sensationalism .\nIt is not .\nHere \u2019 s a video from the WEF \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEO of Pfizer , talks about pills that contain microchips .\nIs this field truly fascinating ?\nOr utterly dystopian ?\nAs Bourla himself said : Imagine the compliance .\nThis kind of technology could easily open the door to all kinds of nefarious applications .\nSince then , COVID put Pfizer in a position of power never seen before for a pharmaceutical company .\nLike Pfizer , the WEF is also using COVID to further its agenda .\nIn 2020 and 2021 , cities around the world were subjected to massive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicides , drug overdoses , isolation , mental health issues , domestic abuse , bankruptcies , and homelessness .\nDuring this horrific period , children could not attend school for months and were essentially barred from interacting with other children .\nA slew of small and medium businesses was destroyed while large corporations strived .\nDespite all of this , the WEF could not hide its love of drastic , life-destroying lockdowns .\nIn fact , it released a video surrealistically called \u201c Lockdowns are quietly improving cities around the world \u201d .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ insanity .\nThe video states \u201c Lockdowns significantly reduced human activity \u2026 leading to Earth \u2019 s quietest period in decades , \u201d while showing dystopian images of empty cities and planes stuck on the ground .\nCompletely ignoring the immense human suffering caused by these lockdowns , the WEF considered it was all worth it because \u201c carbon emissions were down 7 % in 2020 \u201d .\nWhen this thing was first posted , it garnered intense backlash .\nSo the WEF deleted the video above and posted this tweet .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video , the WEF kept praising lockdowns .\nThat \u2019 s because the WEF would love to see \u201c covidian \u201d life become permanent .\nJudging by comments on YouTube and social media , people absolutely hate videos created by the WEF .\nBut they keep coming .\nBecause they don \u2019 t care what you think .\nThey just want to plant their seed of insanity into your mind .\nIn a video titled \u201c How our lives could soon look \u201d ( read my full article about it here ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peek at the future \u201d .\nAnd it is BLEAK .\nIt is all about making COVID life permanent .\nThe video is filled with masked people , purell dispensers , and QR codes .\nThis is the future they want .\nThen , there \u2019 s this nugget of insanity .\nAs if that wasn \u2019 t enough , the video shows children stuck at home and being schooled through screens .\nThe video ends by showing people wearing masks outside , like crazy people .\nAs stated above , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity \u201d .\nIt is not only an opportunity to reshape our personal existence but to restructure the entire world structure according to its principles .\nThe WEF calls it \u201c the Great Reset \u201d .\nTo promote this Reset ( that absolutely nobody wants ) the WEF released a propaganda video ( it really fits the definition of \u201c propaganda \u201d ) .\nHere it is in all of its insanity .\nWhen I posted an article about this video in 2021 , the comments were not yet turned off .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones .\nThis short video manages to contain an incredible amount of subversive messages .\nIt even ridiculizes \u201c conspiracy theories \u201d while , astoundingly , confirming these theories .\nThe video also announced the \u201c death of capitalism \u201d .\nWhile capitalism is based on a self-regulating system of offer and demand , the Great Reset looks to redefine the way businesses are evaluated through new parameters .\nThe main one : Compliance with the elite \u2019 s social and political agendas .\nTowards the end , the narrator utters this enigmatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t quite explain what this sentence actually means in real-life situations , its implications are rather chilling .\nInstead of allowing successful individuals and businesses to grow organically , the elite \u2019 s system would interfere to \u201c get the right people at the right place at the right time \u201d , in accordance with its agenda .\nIn other words , the system would be rigged and compliance with a wider agenda would be mandatory in a new economy .\nThe video ends with a call to viewers to get involved .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ re not actually invited to the WEF .\nIn fact , they \u2019 re actually looking to \u201c recalibrate \u201d your freedom of speech .\nAn easy way to identify world leaders who are groomed by the WEF is through their incessant railing against free speech .\nThey absolutely hate it and they \u2019 re constantly calling for the internet to be censored and highly regulated .\nAt the 2022 Davos meeting , Australian \u201c eSafety commissioner \u201d Julie Inman Grant stated that we need a \u201c recalibration of free speech \u201d .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nShe even believes that freedom of speech as a human right should be \u201c recalibrated \u201d using \u201c online violence \u201d as an excuse .\nThere is no such thing as \u201c online violence \u201d .\nThey love to equate speech with violence .\nIt is an extremely manipulative way of justifying China-style censorship .\nFree speech is , in fact , binary .\nEither it exists or it doesn \u2019 t .\nAnd they clearly don \u2019 t want it to exist .\nThe WEF wants to control your clothes .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it .\nDid I mention that people absolutely hate WEF videos ?\nHere \u2019 s another one that got people \u2019 s blood boiling .\nUsing the environment as an excuse ( as usual ) , the WEF announced the coming of clothing laced with \u201c digital passports \u201d that can be traced at all times .\nBacked by Microsoft ( of course ) , these garments will apparently flood the market by 2025 .\nAccording to the WEF , these chips will allow fashion brands to resell their clothes .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe video makes sure NOT to mention that this technology would be a great way of tracking those who ditched their smartphones .\nBut ditching your smartphone might become \u2026 impossible .\n# 2 \u201c Smartphones will be in your body by 2030 \u201d At the 2022 Davos meeting , Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark claimed that , by 2030 , \u201c smartphones will be implanted directly into the body.\n\u201d This would coincide with the coming of 6G technology , which is expected to be launched by the end of the decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been documenting the elite \u2019 s incessant push for transhumanism , which is the merging of humans with machines .\nThey \u2019 re looking to accelerate this transition by making things people can not live without ( such as smartphones ) available in transhumanist form .\nAre you noticing their creepy eagerness to insert things inside our bodies ?\n# 1 \u201c You \u2019 ll Own Nothing .\nAnd You \u2019 ll Be Happy.\n\u201d This is probably the most dystopian moment in WEF history .\nIn 2016 , Ida Auken , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The WEF loved that quote so much that it tweeted about it .\nThe WEF also created a video ( that everybody absolutely hated ) titled \u201c 8 Predictions for the World in 2030 \u201d .\nHere \u2019 s a screenshot .\nAn article on the WEF \u2019 s website explains : In this dystopian future , there are no products you can own .\nOnly \u201c services \u201d that are rented and delivered using drones .\nThis system would make all humans completely dependent on WEF-controlled corporations for every single basic need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no freedom , and no privacy .\nAnd you \u2019 ll be happy .\nAt the 2022 Davos meeting , Alibaba Group president J. Michael Evans announced the development of an \u201c individual carbon tracker \u201d .\nOnce again , the WEF uses the environment to promote the micro-management of human behavior .\nEvans says that the tracker can monitor \u201c where they \u2019 re traveling , how they \u2019 re traveling , what are they \u2019 re eating and what are they consuming on the platform \u201d .\nNotice that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not \u201c we \u201d because there is no way in hell he \u2019 s going to use that thing .\nMe neither .\nUpon reviewing this list , two common themes become obvious .\nThe first theme is \u201c penetration \u201d .\nThe WEF wants to penetrate governments using \u201c Global Leaders \u201d ( aka Manchurian candidates ) .\nIt also wants to penetrate our bodies through pills , microchips , and vaccines .\nIt also wants to penetrate our minds using soundwaves , censorship , and propaganda .\nThe other theme is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control what we think , where we go , what we say , what we eat , and what we wear .\nDo you know who agrees with the WEF ?\nChina .\nCensorship is widespread , a social credit system controls people \u2019 s behaviors and COVID is still used as an excuse for massive lockdowns and total population control .\nNot to mention the literal concentration camps .\nDespite all of this , Chinese officials are constantly present at WEF meetings .\nWhy ?\nBecause China is basically a laboratory for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of that being said , how can we counteract the WEF \u2019 s insanity ?\nHow can we vote them out if they were never voted in ?\nA first step would be to elect \u2013 at all levels of government \u2013 representatives that want nothing to do with the WEF .\nIf our elected officials treated the WEF as the rogue , illegitimate organization that it

Presidential Advisor Who Introduced Epstein to Clinton Found Dead By Hanging With Gunshot Wound to Chest", "content": "As you probably know , Jeffrey Epstein was a billionaire child trafficker whose 2019 arrest , incarceration , and highly anticipated trial threatened to expose the elite \u2019 s sick tendencies .\nThe flight logs of his infamous Lolita Express ( the private jet used to transport guests and victims to Epstein \u2019 s private island ) is a who \u2019 s who of the global elite : Politicians , celebrities , scientists , financiers , members of royal families , etc .\nDozens of

long-awaited trial never took place .\nEpstein was found dead in his cell in mysterious circumstances .\nAnd , since then , several individuals who were close to Epstein also died in mysterious circumstances .\nFor instance , in 2020 , Hollywood producer Steve Bing ( who was close with Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton ) died after falling off the 27th floor of his apartment building .\nWhile the official cause of death is \u201c suicide \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Russian-mafia style \u201d because he knew too much ( read my article about him here ) .\nLast February , Jean-Luc Brunel \u2013 the fashion agent who procured over 1,000 girls for Epstein \u2013 was found dead hanging in his jail cell .\nAgain , the official cause of death was deemed suicide .\nAgain , observers believe that he might have been killed because he knew too much .\nAnd that list of bizarre deaths keeps growing .\nOn May 7th , Bill Clinton \u2019 s former presidential advisor Mark Middleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of circumstances .\nMark Middleton was a former presidential advisor to Bill Clinton and the financial director of his presidential campaign .\nHe is said to have introduced Clinton to Jeffrey Epstein as he personally invited the billionaire at least seven times to the White House .\nMiddleton also boarded Epstein \u2019 s jet multiple times .\nDespite Middleton \u2019 s great influence on the President , his career at the White House ended on a sour note .\n\u201c Middleton left the White House in February 1995 and was accused of setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly the kind of person that would appeal to Epstein .\nIn 1996 an investigation by the White House found that Middleton had abused his access to impress business clients and he was barred from the executive mansion without senior approval.\n\u201d \u2013 Daily Mail , Family of Bill Clinton advisor who admitted Jeffrey Epstein into White House seven times has blocked release of files detailing the death scene On May 7th , 2022 , Middleton died suddenly at age 59 .\nHe was found hanging from a tree with a cheap Dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gunshot wound to his chest .\nAccording to authorities , Middleton trespassed on Heifer Ranch ( which was located about 30 miles from his house ) and used a table to construct makeshift gallows .\nHe died from a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the chest .\nHe found a tree and he pulled a table over there , and he got on that table , and he took an extension cord and put it around a limb , put it around his neck and he shot himself in the chest with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shotgun worked because there was not a lot of blood or anything on the scene .\nYou can tell the shotgun blast was on his chest , you can tell that because there is a hole in the chest and pellets came out the back of his back .\nIt was definitely self-inflicted in our opinion.\n\u201d According to the sheriff , Middleton was \u201c depressed \u201d .\nDespite lots of unanswered questions , the death was quickly determined to be a suicide .\nFurthermore , the sheriff stopped speaking with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middleton family filed a lawsuit preventing the release of information regarding this case .\nThe lawsuit states that the family has \u201c a privacy interest in preventing any \u2018 photographs , videos , sketches ( or ) other illustrative content \u2019 from the death scene being released \u201d , claiming that this material would lead to \u201c outlandish , hurtful , unsupported and offensive articles \u2019 being published online \u201d .\nThis lawsuit did not prevent people close to Middleton from voicing concerns .\nA business associate of Middleton is now calling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that the man committed suicide .\nIn an interview with RadarOnline , the associated stated : The associate also stated that Middleton dealt with companies close to the Clintons .\nGlasgow vanished without a trace in 2008 after reporting financial irregularities with the Clinton library construction costs and his skeletal remains were found at Petit Jean State Park in 2015 .\nHis cause of death is undetermined.\n\u201d \u2013 Ibid .\nWhile this story is already incredibly suspicious , it gets worse .\nA woman linked to Middleton was found dead in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHaynes was a mother of two from the Little Rock suburb of Maumelle .\nShe vanished on January 12th , after leaving a note on her kitchen counter stating \u201c on the water , love you all.\n\u201d After a massive search , her corpse was discovered four days later by a family friend \u2026 submerged in 10 feet of water .\nThe police report stated : \u201c Mrs .\nHaynes had a bag strapped to her leg with a green extension cord .\nInside the bag was a large concrete block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people close to Haynes can not believe this woman committed suicide in such a matter .\nA source close to Haynes , who worked for a charitable group to feed and clothe the homeless , tells Radar the 110-pound former model turned yoga teacher , would have never taken her own life \u2013 let alone paddleboard down the river lugging a 58-pound concrete suicide block !\n\u201c It didn \u2019 t make any sense , she would never kill herself , \u201d the Haynes source said .\n\u201c When I heard she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play .\nI don \u2019 t believe she killed herself .\nHow could she water paddle down the river with a concrete block !\n\u201d \u2013 Ibid .\nMonths prior , Haynes was seen in Mark Middleton \u2019 s office to discuss an urgent matter .\n\u201c I saw her in Mark \u2019 s office !\n\u201d the business associate tells RadarOnline.com .\n\u201c I was leaving and he ( Middleton ) was telling me that he had a very important financial meeting \u2013 and that \u2019 s the woman who came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if there is anything connection there or not , but I know that it was shocking to me to hear she drowns while paddling in the Arkansas River , \u201d the source said .\n\u201c Then Mark mysteriously dies a few months later ?\n\u201d \u2013 Ibid .\nJust like Middleton , Haynes was said to be \u201c depressed \u201d and her death was determined to be \u201c suicide \u201d by investigators , even though neither of them left a suicide note .\nWeeks before the death of Jeffrey Epstein , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicided \u201d because his trial could potentially expose some of the dark secrets of the global elite .\nSince then , several prominent people linked to Epstein and Clinton appear to have been \u201c suicided \u201d as well .\nWhen one analyzes the circumstances surrounding each death , a pattern emerges : No suicide note , no in-depth investigation , and little to no media coverage .\nThe death of Mark Middleton fits right into this pattern .\nThe man who introduced Epstein to Clinton was found hanging with a gunshot wound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deemed a suicide .\nFurthermore , any kind of investigation relating to the case has been cut short .\nDespite this fact , there \u2019 s one all-important detail that strongly hints at a non-suicide : The usage of a Dollar-store extension cord .\nWhy would anyone who is adamant about committing suicide by hanging use a cheaply made , plastic extension cord instead of actual rope ?\nFurthermore , why would a 100-pound woman use the same type of extension cord to attach her leg to a 58-pound concrete block ?\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two individuals were actually \u201c suicided \u201d , the extension cord becomes a code left by the perpetrators .\nFirst , this bizarre prop links both deaths in a rather unequivocal matter .\nFurthermore , the power cord itself might symbolize the reason why they were \u201c suicided \u201d .\nMaybe it \u2019 s because they were both too close to \u2026 power

population of less than 500 million , humanity needs to be reduced by about 93 % .\nFor this reason , the Guidestones were believed to be concrete proof of the elite \u2019 s fixation with massive

one thinks about musical greatness , one inevitably thinks about Grimes and Bella Poarch .\nThey \u2019 re definitely up there with the greats .\nDJ Khaled likes to scream \u201c WE THE BEST MUSIC \u201d in his songs , but he \u2019 s wrong .\nTHEY the best music .\nEvery song they ever made is nothing less than a timeless masterpiece that will be enjoyed for generations to come .\nAlright , I reached my sarcasm quota for the day .\nThe truth is : They \u2019 re both industry slaves .\nAnd everything about them points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a massive star amongst children and teenagers .\nHer celebrity status is due to Tik Tok , the Chinese social media app that is profoundly affecting the behavior of an entire generation of kids while gathering a staggering amount of data about them .\nApparently , Tik Tok \u2019 s algorithm really loves Bella Poarch as she \u2019 s one of the most watched personalities on the planet .\nGrimes is also a big celebrity \u2013 mostly because she had a child with billionaire Elon Musk .\nSince then , she used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to embed herself all over mass media and social media .\nAlthough Grimes and Bella Poarch became stars through different paths , the end result is the same : They \u2019 ve turned into industry slaves who are used to promote the elite \u2019 s sick agenda .\nWhat happens when you put these two self-proclaimed robots together in a video ?\nAn MKULTRA/transhumanist festival that is appropriately called Dolls .\nRobots are programmed to accomplish specific tasks .\nAnd this is what these two robots do .\nTheir mission : To expose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind-rotting agenda .\nTo put things in context , Dolls continues where Bella Poarch \u2019 s video Build a B*tch video left off ( read my article about it here ) .\nYup , her first video was literally titled Build a B*tch and it featured Bella being put together in some sort of sex doll factory .\nThen the dolls went haywire and wreaked havoc on us all .\nIt was awful .\nOf course , the entire thing was littered with intense MK symbolism .\nThe entire concept of Bella being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to Monarch mind control where slaves are programmed to become sex slaves ( Beta programming ) or killers ( Delta programming ) .\nWe see examples of both in the video .\nWith that being said , the video was a massive hit with young people as it currently sits at over 400 million views on YouTube .\nDolls is the sequel and everything was done to attract young eyes to its agenda .\nHere \u2019 s a look at the video .\nDolls begins with Bella holding her dying friend and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presses a button and we see the title screen .\nIn MK programming , the symbol of the rabbit is all-important .\nLike the white rabbit who leads Alice through the looking glass to Wonderland , the MK handler leads the MK slave to dissociation .\nIn other words , this rabbit is there because this video is all about mind control .\nSo Bella manages to push that thing off her and she starts liberating her fellow dolls ( MK slaves ) .\nThe blond girl with the stockings is Chloe Cherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who appeared in over 200 films .\nMore recently , she starred in Euphoria , a teen drama that insidiously grooms its young viewers by exposing them to hardcore sexuality involving minors .\nNow , Chloe Cherry appears in a video that is aimed at the Tik Tok generation .\nWith all of that being said , Poarch is still missing an arm .\nSo Bella puts on the arm and she becomes super powerful .\nShe punches stuff and even shoots electric blasts .\nThis is how the elite sells transhumanism ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the youth .\nBy making it cool .\nTranshumanism is a philosophy that promotes the merging of humans with robots and it has been gaining steam in the past years .\nAll across mass media , from blockbuster films to music videos , the addition of robotic parts to the human body is portrayed as an infinitely cool upgrade that grants superpowers .\nEquipped with her transhumanist arm , Bella leads her army of robots to the headquarters of the company that made them .\nSo , on one side , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , we \u2019 ve got the men .\nEvil , generic , faceless , white men .\nThey \u2019 re the enemy .\nThrough this scene , another important agenda is communicated to children : Division and hatred between men and women .\nThroughout the years , I \u2019 ve analyzed countless music videos portraying the torture and murder of men as a good , empowering thing .\nThat \u2019 s because masculinity is not a trait that is desired in the elite \u2019 s New World Order .\nThe hooded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks down on his empire .\nHe owns everything .\nHe is also the MK handler of Bella Poarch .\nIn other words , they \u2019 re telling you exactly who they are .\nAt the bottom right , we can see a billboard promoting an amusement park titled \u201c No Man \u2019 s Land \u201d .\nIt \u2019 s a small detail but it represents the radical ideology that rules the industry .\nIt hates men , it hates masculinity and it wants to suppress it .\nAnd who is behind it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the elite .\nBecause he knows .\nIf men decided to unite and kick his ass , he \u2019 d be done .\nThat \u2019 s how rulers were brought down throughout history .\nHowever , just as Bella was about to get the guy , he presses a button .\nGrimes is basically an MK slave programmed to protect her handler .\nAnd she does so by fighting Bella for a while .\nHowever , during the fight , the robots end up in the secret monitoring room .\nThe two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say : \u201c Look at what is happening .\nWe shouldn \u2019 t be fighting each other , we should be uniting against the patriarchy and fight men .\nAlso , check out my butt \u201d .\nThe video ends by listing the \u201c celebrities \u201d that appeared in the video .\nI didn \u2019 t recognize any of them but I found out they \u2019 re YouTubers , streamers , influencers , porn stars , and other people with no discernable talent .\nRemember when people in music videos had something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not important anymore .\nIt is all about reaching the brains of children by any means necessary .\nNot too long ago , parents used to complain about young musicians being too rebellious .\nNowadays , we are seeing the exact opposite .\nPop stars are constantly depicted as literal robots with no minds of their own and no free will .\nThey \u2019 re fully controlled by powerful individuals and they \u2019 re completely powerless against them .\nNow consider the fact that young people live their formative years looking up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of generation is being molded by this culture averse to freedom and independence ?\nSome might say that Bella is actually fighting against the system in the video .\nShe \u2019 s really not .\nWhile \u201c fighting against the elite \u201d , she actually promotes its agendas such as transhumanism , mind control , and war between sexes .\nShe was programmed to do so .\nAnd now she is used to program our children .", "author": "Vigilant Citizen", "url":

was scrunched up in utter confusion .\nI can \u2019 t say that I \u2019 m a James Bond aficionado , but that movie did not feel like James Bond at all .\nIsn \u2019 t he all about guns , girls , and gadgets ?\nWith my face still scrunched up , I looked up some movie reviews to make sure I wasn \u2019 t crazy .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo what happened to James Bond ?\nOne word : Agendas .\nThe cool , suave , confident , patriotic , and womanizing hero of the past does not fit today \u2019 s social climate .\nSean Connery \u2019 s version of James Bond was a 20th-century version of propaganda .\nIt was about promoting the MI6 and Great Britain as a whole through popular culture using a charismatic protagonist .\nAnd it worked .\nHowever , we are in the 21st century .\nGlobalism turned national pride into national shame and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Bond of the past is now \u201c problematic \u201d and modern James Bond has to comply with today \u2019 s cultural orthodoxy .\nThe result is No Time to Die \u2013 a bastard product of this joyless cultural climate .\nNearly everything about this movie is infused with an agenda , from Bond \u2019 s entire \u201c vibe \u201d to the actual story which is based around viruses , DNA-enabled poisons , and the constant fear of being contaminated by something .\nIn short , depressing , un-entertaining stuff .\nFurthermore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind-boggling .\nWhile the development of this movie reportedly began in 2017 , its subject matter appears to be directly inspired by COVID and monkeypox epidemics .\nIt \u2019 s almost as if they knew those things would happen .\nIs No Time to Die another example of predictive programming ?\nHere \u2019 s a look at the movie .\nRight from the opening credits , the viewers are treated with some dark , demoralizing stuff .\nAs Billie Eilish sings the most depressing James Bond theme ever made , the visuals allude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness .\nGuess what happens to Britannia ?\nThen , we see symbolic representations of the main plot of the movie : A DNA-targeting virus that infects and kills people .\nRight at this point , we \u2019 ve got enough information to know that this movie is going to be a downer .\nHowever , on the first watch , none of these symbols make sense .\nMost viewers are still pumped about watching a new James Bond flick filled with adventure and cool gadgets .\nSo in which exotic location will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lab in London that makes weaponized smallpox .\nAwesome .\nNo Time to Die was made a few years before the monkeypox epidemic of 2022 which caused the WHO to declare a health emergency .\nStrangely enough , the movie is all about weaponized virus escaping a secret MI6 lab .\nMad at the joke , the scientist with the smallpox lunch says : This entire dialog appears to be written by some guy who works at the WHO or something .\nHeracles is the name of a divine hero from Greek mythology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u201c protector of mankind \u201d , he died in a symbolic way : Through poisoned blood .\nIn the movie , the Heracles virus kills people by poisoning their blood .\nAt one point , the head of the MI6 explains how it works : However , since it was leaked from the lab and modified by rogue scientists , the virus can now target families , genetic traits and entire ethnicities .\nTheir conclusion : Weaponized viruses , DNA-targeting , and massive depopulation : Those are the ultimate fantasies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time to Die is littered with symbolic references to the occult elite .\nThe name of the main bad guy in the movie is Lyutsifer Safin .\nHis first name is a Russian transliteration of the name Lucifer .\nThe choice of this name is to make sure you understand that this is an occult elite fantasy .\nAs you might know , the one-eye sign is the favorite symbol of the occult elite .\nIn No Time to Die , the symbol is everywhere .\nAll of these references to one eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those in power plastered the world with their symbols .\nRight now , the occult elite rules entertainment so the one-eye sign is everywhere .\nIn fact , the entire narrative of No Time to Die is tainted with the occult elite \u2019 s obsessions .\nOne of them : The destruction of heroic men .\nJames Bond used to be a free , unattached , and adventurous spy who traveled to exotic locations and hooked up with alluring yet dangerous \u201c Bond girls \u201d .\nAnd , no matter what happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking sharp .\nDaniel Craig \u2019 s Bond is the exact opposite of what you just read .\nIf old-school James Bond was unfazed , new James Bond is continually fazed .\nOn a couple of occasions , he \u2019 s even disrespected and humiliated .\nSo the legendary 007 is not even 007 in his own movie .\nThen we see him sitting in the passenger seat as Nomi drives him around .\nIt \u2019 s all very symbolic .\nIt \u2019 s all about subtle emasculation .\nWhile in Cuba , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has all of the makings of a \u201c Bond girl \u201d .\nHowever , when Bond comes on to her , she rejects him with a slightly disgusted look on her face , as if saying \u201c Ew , don \u2019 t touch me you old perv \u201d .\nWhy was this cringe-inducing scene kept in this three-hour movie ?\nBecause the makers of the movie thought that its message was very important .\nThen , Bond discovers that he has a daughter with Madeleine Swann .\nShe \u2019 s the daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is part of Spectre .\nAs seen in my 2016 article about the movie Spectre , this organization represents the occult elite .\nIn other words , Bond finds himself in a relationship with the bad guys and the occult elite in general .\nHe \u2019 s not free nor independent , he \u2019 s owned and attached to Spectre .\nSince Bond historically represents Great Britain , his relationship with Swann represents Britain being \u201c married \u201d with the globalist elite .\nThen , Bond brings his entire family through a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the whole thing .\nBond is also miserable on a physical level .\nJames Bond gadgets used to be fun and cool .\nNow they \u2019 re injections that allow the MI6 to track his location while monitoring his vitals .\nThat \u2019 s the opposite of fun and cool .\nAnd Bond hates it .\nDuring his final mission , Bond discovers that he \u2019 s been infected with Heracles .\nLyutsifer tells him that , if he gets close to Madeleine or his daughter , they will die .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just look at his face .\nPure misery .\nAfter nearly three hours of watching this thing , I had the same exact face .\nAnd it \u2019 s not even over .\nThings manage to get worse .\nWith Bond \u2019 s approval , the MI6 launched missiles to destroy Lyutsifer \u2019 s island which was used to create the virus .\nHowever , instead of fleeing the island before the missiles explode , Bond just gives up and stays on the island .\nThen he dies , killed by missiles shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say : \u201c That \u2019 s so emotional !\nHe couldn \u2019 t bare living without his family so he preferred to die .\nI \u2019 m in tears .\n\ud83d\ude41 \u201d Hold on just a second .\nFirst , he didn \u2019 t even know he had a daughter like two hours ago .\nAnd he said about 7 words to her throughout the movie .\nMaybe dying for her is not the most rational option right now .\nSecond , if he truly loved her , wouldn \u2019 t it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nI mean , he could have communicated with his family using Facetime or something .\nWouldn \u2019 t that situation be better for his daughter rather than her growing up knowing that her dad basically committed suicide ?\nFinally , it \u2019 s JAMES BOND .\nHe has access to the latest technology available on Earth .\nIf he remained alive for a bit , maybe a cure for Heracles could have been discovered .\nThen he could have lived happily ever after with his family .\nBut no .\nHe had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearless , and intelligent hero of the past does not belong in the 21st century .\nModern heroes are depressed , injected with \u201c smart blood \u201d , infected with lab-created viruses , and killed by their own country .\nAnd that \u2019 s exactly what they want for you .\nYou might have noticed that No Time to Die irritated me a bit .\nAnd I believe this was done on purpose .\nGlobalist-controlled media takes pleasure in corrupting popular franchises by injecting them with its toxic agenda .\nThey know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it anyways .\nIf they created new franchises containing their agenda , nobody would watch them .\nSo they ride on the popularity of existing franchises while \u201c infecting \u201d them with their poison , the same way Heracles infected James Bond .\nFrom beginning to end , No Time to Die was bleak and joyless .\nBecause they want our lives to be bleak and joyless .\nThe narrative revolves around viruses , DNA-targeting , medical lab leaks , and other topics that are anxiety-inducing .\nMeanwhile , James Bond is sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight and responsibilities of a family that popped out of nowhere .\nThen he is killed by his own country .\nThis is not entertainment , this is social conditioning .\nNot even James freaking Bond can escape the elite \u2019 s weird weaponized viruses .\nWhat message does that send to us regular people ?\nIn short , if someone asks you : Because life is too short for

"source": "vigilantcitizen", "title": "The Traumatic Life and Suspicious Death of Anne Heche", "content": "On August 5th , Anne Heche sped through a residential area , crashed her car into a Los Angeles home , and was taken to a hospital after a bizarre \u201c rescue \u201d that she actually attempted to escape .\nSix days later , the 53-year-old actress was pronounced \u201c brain dead \u201d and the coroner quickly ruled the death as \u201c accidental \u201d due to \u201c inhalation of smoke and thermal injuries \u201d .\nSince then , strange facts and puzzling videos have surfaced online pointing to the fact that there \u2019 s more to the story than what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Heche was distraught about something .\nHowever , as is often the case in these strange Hollywood deaths , police investigation was cut short and the media focused its coverage on her consuming drugs and alcohol .\nWhat actually happened on that fateful day ?\nIn order to get a clearer picture of these chaotic moments , we first need to look at Heche \u2019 s life and projects .\nBecause , maybe , she knew too much .\nAnne Heche \u2019 s early years were nothing less than traumatic .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father repeatedly raped her from the time she was an infant until she was 12 years old .\nWhen Heche was 13 , her father died from HIV/AIDS at 45 years old .\nIn interviews , Heche stated that her father contracted the disease after having sex with multiple homosexual partners .\nWhen she was asked why a homosexual man would abuse a young girl , she replied : Three months after her father \u2019 s death , her 18-year-old brother Nathan died in a car crash .\nWhile the official determination was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and struck a tree , Heche believes that it was a suicide .\nIn a 2001 interview with Barbara Walters , Heche stated that the abuse she underwent during childhood caused her to believe that she was two different people .\nShe said : Here , Heche described dissociation and alter-personas , two core concepts of Monarch mind control \u2013 a practice that is rampant in Hollywood .\nBy the time she was 25 , Heche said her personality had begun to \u201c fragment \u201d , shattering into moments of madness .\nCelestia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a reincarnation of God , spoke a different language and had special powers .\nMK slaves are sometimes programmed for ESP ( extra-sensory perception ) .\nThe fact that Heche described all of the core aspects of mind control indicates that she might have undergone some type of programming .\nIt is also possible that she had faint , distorted memories of it ( i.e .\nshe \u201c learned it from God \u201d ) .\nHeche \u2019 s first public relationship was with actor Steve Martin \u2013 who was 24 years her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a highly publicized relationship with Ellen Degeneres .\nIn August 2000 , on the day following her breakup with Ellen , Heche had one of those MKULTRA-style breakdowns , complete with bizarre , erratic behavior .\nIn her 20/20 interview said about this bizarre night : In 2001 , Heche released a book about her mental issues .\nAfter these troubled years , Heche apparently found some mental health and stability .\nShe eventually married actor James Tupper with whom she had a child .\nIn the following years , she took part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Heche starred in Toxic Skies \u2013 a movie that gained renewed interest following COVID-19 .\nIn the movie , Heche plays the role of a doctor who works for the Global Health Organization ( a reference to the World Health Organization ) during the outbreak of a pandemic .\nAs the government puts all of Seattle under quarantine ( even using the military to prevent people from leaving the city ) , she discovers the root cause of the illness : Chemtrails .\nIndeed , the epidemic was caused by a secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toxins in jet fuel .\nThen , she discovers the sinister reason behind this man-made epidemic : Forcing mass vaccinations .\nAt the time of her death , Heche was working on a movie about child sex trafficking : Girl in Room 13 .\nThe movie is about an opioid-addicted girl who is held captive in a motel room by her former drug dealer as he tries to force her into sex trafficking .\nTo do so , the dealer attempts to break her down by using drugs , alcohol and by starving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Lifetime movie is set to premiere on September 13th .\nThe fact that Heche died in mysterious circumstances while working on a movie about sex trafficking raised some eyebrows .\nThe situation is reminiscent of the bizarre death of Avicii who died shortly after releasing a music video denouncing child sex trafficking .\nThese social media posts were promptly hidden and \u201c fact-checked \u201d by social media moderation .\nEvery time mass media engages in these bouts of censorship and \u201c fact-checking \u201d , there \u2019 s something off .\nWhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Epstein , there \u2019 s a clear media effort to control the narrative surrounding Anne Heche \u2019 s death .\nHowever , the bizarre circumstances surrounding her fatal accident are rather difficult to ignore .\nSimply put , the events of August 5th are bizarre .\nWhile the official story states that Heche was drugged out of her mind ( cocaine and fentanyl were reportedly found in her bloodstream ) , facts seem to tell a different story .\nPrior to her fatal car ride , Heche was seen at a beauty salon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe owner told Heche that the red wig hadn \u2019 t been cut , styled , or even washed yet , but she reportedly did not care .\nIn an interview with the LA Times , the salon owner stated that Heche acted like a \u201c sweet little girl \u201d when she stopped by at around 10:30 am .\nHe added that she was \u201c very pleasant \u201d and that she \u201c wasn \u2019 t speaking in cursive \u201d \u2013 his way of saying that she did not appear to be under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So why was Heche buying a wig in the first place ?\nWas she trying to change her appearance and travel incognito ?\nBecause , in the events that followed , Heche was clearly spooked by something .\nShortly after buying the wig , Heche crashes her car into a garage .\nIn one video , we hear a man forcefully ordering Heche to get out of the car .\nInstead of complying , Heche backs away and peels off .\nWhy was this man yelling at Heche ?\nWas he angry at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c after her \u201d ?\nClearly , Heche did not trust him .\nPrior to the second crash , a ring video captured Heche \u2019 s car bolting down a residential street at a dangerous speed before crashing .\nThen , her car crashed into a home at such a high speed that it went through its entire length and sparked a massive fire .\nSo , minutes prior , Heche was at a salon where a witness claimed that she did not appear inebriated .\nThen , she drives in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened ?\nWas her car hacked and remote-controlled ( a known tactic to hide assassinations as accidents ) ?\nNo matter what \u2019 s the case , the events that follow only add to the suspicious nature of the situation .\nJust watch this video of Heche being \u201c rescued \u201d by firefighters .\nHeche pulled away the white sheets that covered her and desperately attempted to get off the stretcher .\nThe firefighters then forced her into the ambulance .\nWhy was Heche trying to get away ?\nIt is almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into that ambulance , she would never leave the hospital alive .\nFurthermore , why wasn \u2019 t Heche fully immobilized with neck protection , cervical collar , oxygen therapy , and other treatments usual given in such cases ?\nShe was jammed into the ambulance while she was literally flailing around .\nWas this a rescue \u2026 or a kidnapping ?\nThe comments section of this YouTube video is full of people highlighting the strange details of this \u201c rescue \u201d .\nHere are some examples .\nEarly news reports stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFurthermore , it was originally reported that she would \u201c pull through \u201d and survive the accident .\nDespite these early reports , Heche was declared \u201c brain dead \u201d on August 12th .\nHours after her death , and despite the strangeness that surrounded the accident , the LAPD announced that it would not investigate Heche \u2019 s death any further .\nThe death was ruled \u201c accidental \u201d due to \u201c inhalation of smoke and thermal injuries \u201d .\nCase closed , apparently .\nSaying that Anne Heche lived a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right from early childhood , she was subjected to the worst abuse imaginable : Repeated rape by her own father .\nThis horrific situation caused her to dissociate from reality and her personality to split \u2013 a response mechanism to intense trauma that is exploited in Monarch programming .\nOne can say that Heche \u2019 s traumatic childhood \u201c prepared \u201d her for the dark side of the entertainment industry as she could be controlled by industry handlers .\nAfter a highly mediatized relationship with Ellen Degeneres , Heche had bouts of erratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other industry slaves such as Britney Spears .\nWhen these types of celebrities manage to ( somewhat ) pry away from the industry , they often become pariahs .\nThey know too much and they tend to become loose cannons .\nSo , they often die in mysterious circumstances .\nIs this what happened to Anne Heche ?\nWere they \u201c after her \u201d ?\nWas she a victim of the \u201c star whackers \u201d as described by Randy Quaid ?\nOne thing is for sure , the last time she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to run away from something .", "author": "Vigilant Citizen", "url": "https://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/the-traumatic-life-and-suspicious-death-of-anne-heche/",

back in 2009 , I highlighted the fact that MTV \u2019 s yearly ceremony is essentially a theatrical performance , complete with recurring actors and an overarching narrative .\nThe goal is to promote specific artists and showcase how they comply with the elite \u2019 s agenda by using blatant symbolism .\nThe 2022 VMAs was no exception .\nA limited number of actors took part in this play ( notably Nicki Minaj , Jack Harlow , and BLACKPINK ) as all kinds of globalist-elite-friendly agendas were being promoted to millions of young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that agenda is simply toxic .\nAs I witnessed the sheer depravity and absurd hyper-sexualization that permeated this show , my thoughts took on a biblical level .\nIndeed , on some occasions , words like \u201c Sodom and Gomorrah \u201d popped into my head because , seriously , we \u2019 re heading there fast .\nThe VMAs were not merely about being \u201c sexy \u201d , it was about weird , twisted , unnatural , and exploitative sexualization that \u2019 s clearly motivated by malevolent forces .\nThis sexualization is not about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the exact opposite .\nIt is about control , submission , and even humiliation .\nThrough symbolism , we understand that the \u201c artists \u201d that are celebrated during these awards are actually slaves of a powerful system that is using them as a weapon for mass indoctrination .\nThink I \u2019 m exaggerating ?\nLet \u2019 s just look at this cursed spectacle and you decide .\nFor some reason , the VMAs was hyper-focused on butts .\nTo an absurd level .\nIt \u2019 s almost as if the makers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewers were toddlers stuck in the anal stage of developement .\nAnd I \u2019 m not only talking about female butts .\nThe first performance of the pre-show featured Saucy Santana dressed like a woman and twerking all over the place .\nThe name of the song : Booty .\nThe chorus of the song : At the end of the pre-show , Dove Cameron performed the song Boyfriend .\nHere \u2019 s the chorus of the song : The song is about Dove convincing a woman that she can be a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own male boyfriend .\nTo sum up the Red Carpet show , the first performance featured a bunch of men twerking while dressed as women .\nThe last performance featured a woman dressed as a man and singing about being a \u201c better boyfriend \u201d .\nIn short , a complete reversal of the sexes .\nI said above , this is not merely about being sexy , this is about twisting human nature and confusing young viewers .\nAll of that and the actual VMA \u2019 s did not even begin yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The entire VMAs were rife with obvious symbolism that strongly hinted at one thing : The occult elite controls everything .\nAs you \u2019 ll soon see , nearly every artist at the VMAs performed under a pyramidal structure that gave the entire show a strange , dystopian vibe .\nThe message : The elite owns these slaves .\nEven up-and-coming artists performed under pyramids .\nThe VMAs also managed to convey the fact that being under the elite \u2019 s pyramid comes at a cost .\nThe first award that was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange scene that might be a classic case of \u201c humiliation ritual \u201d .\nWhen Jack Harlow and Lil Nas X won the \u201c Best Collaboration \u201d award , Lil Nas did not want to get up .\nOnce on stage to accept the award , Lil Nas said : This is what probably happened : Lil Nas was forced to wear this outfit and \u201c they \u201d knew very well that he had to go on stage while wearing it .\nIn numerous previous articles , I stated that Lil Nas was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry .\nThis forced sexual humiliation is part of the price to pay to be an industry slave .\nAs explained in past articles on this site , K-Pop is 100 % part of the occult elite \u2019 s agenda .\nAnd BLACKPINK has been \u201c chosen \u201d to make it big across the world .\nThe group \u2019 s performance at the VMA \u2019 s could not have been more obvious .\nThen things get even more obvious .\nYes , I \u2019 m talking about this symbol .\nTo confirm the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elite , Lisa , a member of the group , went on to win the Best K-POP Video award for her song Lalisa .\nHere \u2019 s the cover art of the album .\nAs you can see , the elite fully infiltrated K-Pop .\nAnd it is doing the same with Latin music .\nThe 2022 VMAs featured several Latin artists and all of them managed to display complete submission to the occult elite .\nSome might say : I know .\nBut here \u2019 s an actual lyric that was rapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhile this line barely makes any sense , it was said in this specific context for a purpose .\nIt confirmed that these triangles you are seeing throughout the show symbolize the elite .\nAt one point , Anitta says : As said above , the VMA \u2019 s were strongly focused on butts .\nAs soon as Anitta talked about \u201c shaking her ass \u201d , this symbolic thing happened .\nThe message of this scene : Be a Sex Kitten slave and the occult elite will \u201c open the doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a recent article , the Brazilian singer Anitta has been hard at work doing the occult elite \u2019 s bidding .\nOf course , to confirm that she \u2019 s a \u201c chosen one \u201d Anitta won the award of \u201c Best Latin Video \u201d .\nAs explained in my very first article about the VMAs , red is the color of sacrifice

masses .\nI mean , just look at the trailer and tell me it doesn \u2019 t openly celebrate Satan .\nI did not watch the entire series , but a simple look at the various trailers available online is more than enough to confirm another fact : Little Demon is drenched in the occult elite \u2019 s agenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see Satan discovering that his offspring is a girl .\nHe immediately responds : \u201c The future is female !\n\u201d .\nBy using this feminist quote , Satan becomes cool , accepting , and inclusive .\nThe blatant satanic imagery of the show hasn \u2019 t gone unnoticed .\nIn a Facebook post , U.S .\nCongressman Mike Johnson described the show as \u201c clearly evil \u201d : The shocking ending to the LSU opener was not the most disturbing part of the game last night .\nFor

get to the remote fast enough to shield my 11-year-old from the preview , and I wonder how many other children were exposed to it\u2014and how many millions more will tune in to the new series , owned and marketed by DISNEY .\nThe trailer included dark images of Hell , demons , and satanic imagery , and an explanation that the main character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disney provides this surreal description :

easy-breezy attitude that sets the tone for the rest of \u2018 Little Demon.\n\u2019 \u201d \u201c Most of the show \u2019 s best moments come when it leans into its hellish premise and plumbs the

promptly deleted his entire Twitter account .\nWhat was the link between Daryl and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unclear .\nMy guess is that his account probably contained pedophile jokes .\nA few days prior , Hollywood director James Gunn had gotten into trouble for tweets about him wanting to abuse young boys .\nBut Harmon did not get into trouble .\nMass media flew to his defense and the video was all

is perfectly in-line with the satanic agenda that has been permeating mass media for years .\nIt is all about countering people \u2019 s natural aversion to the concepts of evil , satanism , and

becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter .\nSatanic possession stops being a soul-destroying ordeal to become a potent way to gain superpowers .\nOne must be blind not to see that the world is currently being swept by a massive wave of indoctrination .\nMass media is making satanism the only \u201c religion \u201d to be allowed mainstream praise and exposure .\nWhat about the fact that real actual satanist

.\nMaybe it \u2019 s all about balance ?\nTo spin this story , this article engaged in shameless disinformation .\nFirst , the tattoo is not a simple pentacle , it is an inverted pentacle \u2013 the same one that is used on the official logo of the Church of Satan .\nHere \u2019 s what Manly P.

, children are temporarily allowed to remove masks \u2026 to eat crickets .\nThey \u2019 re creating a compliant , WEF-friendly generation .\nThe poster above was specifically created to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap psychological tactics , the poster uses arguments such as \u201c everybody \u2019 s doing it \u201d , \u201c you can dip them in CHOCOLATE \u201d and \u201c it makes you cool \u201d .\nAlso , it argues that \u201c meat carries disease \u201d and \u201c makes you sick \u201d .\nApparently , insects can not make you sick .\nThat \u2019 s what the propaganda says .\nLet \u2019 s look at what the science says .\nThe powers that be are laser-focused on humans consuming a specific set of insects namely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and migratory locusts .\nConsidering the wide range of potential foods that can be consumed by humans , why are they focusing on these few \u2013 and particularly disgusting \u2013 species ?\nIs it truly because they are \u201c sustainable \u201d \u2026 or is there a more nefarious reason behind it all ?\nIf one steers away from the obvious propaganda and looks into the scientific research conducted in the past decades , some worrying facts quickly surface .\nThe main one : Insects are toxic .\nA 2019 study titled A parasitological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the transmission of parasitic diseases to humans and animals states the following : From 1 January 2018 came into force Regulation ( EU ) 2015/2238 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 , introducing the concept of \u201c novel foods \u201d , including insects and their parts .\nOne of the most commonly used species of insects are : mealworms ( Tenebrio molitor ) , house crickets ( Acheta domesticus ) , cockroaches ( Blattodea ) and migratory locusts ( Locusta migrans ) .\nIn this context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of edible insects in transmitting parasitic diseases that can cause significant losses in their breeding and may pose a threat to humans and animals .\nThe aim of this study was to identify and evaluate the developmental forms of parasites colonizing edible insects in household farms and pet stores in Central Europe and to determine the potential risk of parasitic infections for humans and animals .\nThe experimental material comprised samples of live insects ( imagines ) from 300 household farms and pet stores , including 75 mealworm farms , 75 house cricket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 75 migrating locust farms .\nParasites were detected in 244 ( 81.33 % ) out of 300 ( 100 % ) examined insect farms .\nIn 206 ( 68.67 % ) of the cases , the identified parasites were pathogenic for insects only ; in 106 ( 35.33 % ) cases , parasites were potentially parasitic for animals ; and in 91 ( 30.33 % ) cases , parasites were potentially pathogenic for humans .\nEdible insects are an underestimated reservoir of human and animal parasites .\nIn short , 30 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study contained parasites that are harmful to humans .\nThe full study describes each parasite that was discovered and noted that they were particularly harmful to the gut and lungs .\nOther studies focused on chitin \u2013 a natural structural component found in insects \u2019 exoskeletons .\nThe 2007 study Chitin induces accumulation in tissue of innate immune cells associated with allergy states : In other words , the study found that chitin causes an allergic reaction in humans .\nMaybe that \u2019 s our bodies way of telling us that we shouldn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nA study focusing on chitosan \u2013 a chemical compound made from chitin \u2013 discovered that its consumption leads to the depletion of vitamins in the human body , which leads to disastrous effects .\nAs if that wasn \u2019 t enough , here \u2019 s a headline from LiveScience .\nWhile insects might show good nutritional value on paper , they might be outright toxic to the human body .\nStudies found that they can harbor parasites , affect the immune system , trigger allergies , and deplete vitamins from the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elite is going full-steam ahead with this agenda .\nAs the masses are being pushed towards the consumption of insects and synthetic products , some odd events are happening around the world directly affecting the food supply .\nIn the Netherlands , the government engaged in a war with livestock farmers because of \u201c pollution \u201d .\nThe goal : To reduce the number of pigs , cattle , and chickens by over 30 % .\nWhether these facts are all part of a cohesive plan or not , they all lead us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increased supply of insects and synthetic foods .\nIn the past months , we \u2019 ve witnessed the emergence of the bug-eating agenda .\nUsing mass media and the educational system , the world elite is in full indoctrination mode to convince the world that crickets , locusts , cockroaches , and mealworms need to become an important part of our diet .\nThe buzzwords used are sustainability , global warming , and pollution .\nThis call for a drastic change in food production is part of a wider plan by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Earth .\nThey want the masses to be content with less as a growing number of resources will be deemed a luxury .\nFurthermore , the bug-eating agenda might have an even darker motive .\nAs shown above , countless studies documented the adverse effects of insects on the human body .\nFarmed insects can contain parasites harmful to humans , weaken the immune system , trigger allergies , and even deplete vitamins from the body .\nWhat better way to create a generation that is even more dependent on big pharma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beyond all of this , there \u2019 s a near-spiritual component to it all .\nConsidering the fact that humans are naturally aversed to insects , why are they insisting on us ingesting them ?\nBecause , to them , bad is good .", "author": "Vigilant Citizen", "url": "https://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/the-elite-is-deseperately-trying-to-convince-you-to-eat-bugs-heres-why/", "published": "Thu, 29

nobody in their right mind ever uses .\nBut Time made it a point to liter its headline with these words .\nThat \u2019 s because the English language is transphobic and needs to be morphed into Orwellian Newspeak .\nIf you \u2019 re confused about these words , here \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insane ) guide to help you .\nSo Time dedicated an article glorifying author and illustrator Maia Kobabe ,

SCHOOLS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is promoting it using crazy made-up words .\nThis is the current state of education and mass media .\nThe \u201c prestigious \u201d British publication The New Statesman just

family is a terrible way to satisfy our desire for love and care \u201d .\nWow .\nHere \u2019 s another amazing argument .\nThe global elite does not like the nuclear family .\nIt is the biggest obstacle in the elite \u2019 s quest for total control over individuals .\nA strong and loving family creates individuals who are happy , healthy , grounded , and more likely to create their own strong and loving family .\nThe elite wants the exact opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused , and heavily medicated individuals that can easily be controlled and manipulated .\nI often refer to the 1963 document \u201c Current Communist Goals \u201d ( which lists 45 objectives to destroy a nation from within ) because it is highly relevant today .\nHere is one of these objectives .\nThis is why this article exists .\nIt is indoctrination .\nRemember the fraudulent , elite-sponsored , Marxist organization that was ironically called Black Lives Matter ?\nHere \u2019 s one of its tenets .\nThe CBC Compares the Fight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Money The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ( CBC ) used to be a respected news outlet .\nHowever , ever since the election of Justin Trudeau , it turned into a ridiculous , highly-biased propaganda outlet of the global elite .\nIt is now a never-ending source of insane headlines .\nFor instance , last year , I wrote about the highly absurd CBC article that unironically called for the banning of words such as tribe , avocado , brainstorm , and blackmail because they were \u201c hurtful \u201d .\nIt was ridiculous .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control language , the CBC shamelessly uses suffering abroad to push agendas in Canada .\nIn this masterpiece of mental gymnastics , the article above compares women being violently repressed to Canadian athletes who are not paid as many millions of dollars as their male counterparts .\nYes , the article compares people being killed by their own government to athletes who are paid in accordance with the revenue they generate .\nAs is the case with many articles on the CBC website , the comments are scathing .\nPeople simply can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding this drivel .\nVox is Very Interested in Your Children \u2019 s Sexuality I \u2019 ve mentioned many times on this site that the elite is hell-bent on stuffing children with hormone replacements and puberty blockers .\nAnd media sources such as Vox are doing their part in promoting this agenda .\nDespite the fact that its nothing less than child abuse .\nAs if to confirm this fact , the lead image of the Vox article is creepy and incredibly symbolic .\nWhat is this image supposed to represent ?\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because I don \u2019 t see any other rational explanation for this weird image in an article promoting the mutilation of children before they even reach puberty .\nHere \u2019 s a message to the word monkeys at Vox : Leave the kids alone and mind your business .\nThe family is not abolished yet .\nA recent post on YouTube \u2019 s official blog apparently had one objective : To annoy people possible by using the word \u201c Latinx \u201d way too many times .\nThis word , specifically created to cater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abomination .\nAnd Hispanic people absolutely hate it .\nHispanic people do not use this word .\nEven worse , they are actually offended by it .\nHere \u2019 s a fact about Spanish ( and several other languages ) : It is gendered .\nSo , by creating a non-gendered word , the propagandists behind this atrocity negated one of the fundamental characteristics of Hispanic culture .\nAlso , it sounds stupid .\nBut YouTube found it important to use that word many many times in a blog post .\nThat \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WAY more important than not pissing off Hispanic people .\nI hope you \u2019 ve enjoyed the first edition of Insane Headlines of the Month .\nFeel free to share your comments and suggestions about this new series as I \u2019 ll tweak and improve this new format in the coming months .\nIf you

"Once upon a time , on a brisk October evening , a family is looking for a movie to watch on Disney+ .\nAll of a sudden , Hocus Pocus 2 appears on the screen and fills everyone with joy !\nThe children are intrigued by the colorful thumbnail image while the parents are nostalgic about the original Hocus Pocus .\nSo the family pops some corn , sits on the couch , and puts on this spooky ( but children-friendly ) movie \u2013 one that is sure to put everyone in the Halloween spirit .\nThen , it happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pocus 2 was not made to simply entertain : It drills children on important social agendas .\nIt mixes the concepts of feminism and sisterhood with satanism and witchcraft in an unholy stew that is served to unsuspecting children worldwide .\nIn many ways , Hocus Pocus 2 is the exact opposite of the original Hocus Pocus .\nIn the 1993 movie , the witches are , without a doubt , the villains .\nWhy ?\nBecause they worship the devil and eat children .\nThat \u2019 s reason enough right ?\nThen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their unique and silly way .\nWhile they \u2019 re entertaining , the witches still need to be banished forever because , like , they keep LURING AND EATING CHILDREN .\nIn Hocus Pocus 2 , things are way more complicated .\nThe witches still worship the devil and eat children \u2026 but they have valid reasons to do so .\nThey \u2019 re not cursed , depraved hags anymore , they \u2019 re strong and empowered women who are misunderstood .\nIn short , Hocus Pocus 2 wants you to side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hocus Pocus 2 starts with an origin story that makes the witches sympathetic to the viewers .\nAt the beginning of the original Hocus Pocus , the old , creepy witches kill a young girl by sucking away her life force .\nAs the witches regain their youthful looks , they cackle away like harpies , clearly indicating to the viewers that these wretched characters are the villains .\nAt the beginning of Hocus Pocus 2 , a young Winifred Sanderson celebrates her 16th birthday with her two sisters .\nHowever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverend of the village knocks on their door and orders Winifred to marry some guy she doesn \u2019 t like .\nWhen Winifred refuses , the reverend orders the sisters to be separated .\nRight from the opening scenes , the viewers are made to side with the witches against the reverend and the Church in general .\nEverything that follows continues on the same \u201c left-handed path \u201d .\nWhen the three sisters flee to the woods , they hear the creepy song the witches sing to lure children : That \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elite .\nAfter attempting to poison and eat the sisters , the Mother Witch realizes that the girls are actually potential witches .\nSo she gives Winifred a birthday gift .\nAs the three sisters browse through the wide array of powerful spells contained in that book , they realize that they can now exact revenge on the village that banished them .\nThis is when they realize that Satan is cool .\nThen , the Mother Witch tells the sisters : Throughout the movie , there are mentions of the witches \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s because , in real life , Salem was the site of the infamous witch trials .\nAs we \u2019 ll see , this movie is actually about witches retaking Salem .\nAnd doing great PR for them .\nAt one point , the Mother Witch wonders why the world is \u201c not too fond of witches \u201d .\nYoung Mary answers : With this answer , the Mother Witch \u2019 s cannibalistic ways are reframed as something fabulous and empowering .\nWhat a great way of normalizing the occult elite \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youthful ( see adrenochrome ) .\nThen , the sisters go back to the village and use the Devil \u2019 s spellbook to burn the reverend \u2019 s house .\nTo children whose entire lives are based on their parents not allowing them to do things , watching this scene is cathartic .\nBlack magic gave these girls the power to get back at oppressive adults and the children watching this think that it \u2019 s cool .\nThe Heroes Are Also Witches In the original Hocus Pocus , the hero is Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy who takes on the witches head-on .\nIn Hocus Pocus 2 , things are VERY different .\nEvery time Mike says something , the camera immediately cuts to the girls rolling their eyes in disbelief at his idiocy .\nIn 2022 , male protagonists can not be strong , heroic , or even smart .\nThey must be jerks .\nMasculinity is bad .\nWitches are good .\nBecause Mike is a representative of toxic masculinity , Becca finds it OK to mess with him .\nSo , during a class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fake spell that ends with the word \u201c seitan \u201d \u2026 which sounds like \u201c Satan \u201d .\nThroughout Hocus Pocus 2 , we hear expressions such as \u201c Holy Lucifer \u201d and \u201c By Lucifer \u2019 s hangnail \u201d .\nThe constant invocation of satanic entities in a children \u2019 s movie made by Disney is rather offputting .\nHowever , it is completely in line with the elite \u2019 s agenda of normalizing everything satanic .\nThe same exact pattern was found in Chilling Adventures of Sabrina .\nIn this Netflix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep hearing expressions such as \u201c Holy Satan \u201d .\nAlso , witchcraft is portrayed as a potent tool of female empowerment while nearly all males in the series are jerks who need to be punished .\nIn Hocus Pocus 2 , the wannabe witches inadvertently bring back the Sanderson sisters on Halloween night by doing a ritual .\nContrary to their 1993 appearance , the witches are greeted in 2022 like superstars .\nIn the first Hocus Pocus , the witches are not welcomed in Salem .\nBecause , for one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s a pretty good reason .\nIn Hocus Pocus 2 , things are different .\nThe lyrics of their introductory song are quite telling .\nIn Hocus Pocus 2 , there \u2019 s a running theme of \u201c times changing \u201d .\nWhile , in the first Hocus Pocus , the witches were evil , the narrative in 2022 has changed .\nToday , witches are good and the movie constantly defends them .\nFor instance , at one point , a character says that the witches are evil because , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So another character immediately defends them : Yup , times have changed .\nWhen the Sanderson sisters visit 2022 Salem , they realize that the town idolizes them .\nLater , the witches find themselves in Salem \u2019 s Halloween festival .\nThey discover that there \u2019 s a contest for the best Sanderson sisters look-a-likes .\nAfter the contest , the Sanderson sisters perform a song that bewitches the crowd .\nThe song contains these lines : The recurring theme of abducting children is upsetting in itself .\nBut it gets worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not actually portrayed as evil .\nIs it a coincidence that the logo of Hocus Pocus 2 contains a symbol used to identify pedophiles ?\nThe Sanderson sisters then use the mind-controlled kids to seek out the mayor of Salem because they want to kill him .\nThe reason : He \u2019 s a descendant of the reverend .\nHowever , the mayor is the father of Becca and Izzy \u2019 s friend , so they must stop the witches \u2026 by becoming witches .\nThe Heroes Become a Coven of Witches In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained possession of the Devil \u2019 s spellbook and were tempted to use it against the witches .\nHowever , Binx the cat stops them and angrily yells out : And that was the end of that .\nThe book was evil so they didn \u2019 t use it .\nThe protagonists ultimately banish the witches with good old-fashioned wit and courage .\nIn Hocus Pocus 2 , it \u2019 s the exact opposite .\nThe Devil \u2019 s spellbook actually saves the day .\nThe girl on the left is the daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reverend .\nTherefore , she broke her family \u2019 s Puritan lineage and converted to the witches \u2019 side .\nConsidering the fact that the Sanderson sisters are sympathetic figures in Hocus Pocus 2 , they are banished from Salem in a very \u201c compassionate \u201d way .\nInstead of burning them to ashes because , like , THEY LURE AND EAT CHILDREN , the ending is all about Winifred reuniting with her sisters in a dignified matter .\nIn short , the witches were never really the \u201c bad guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valued the importance of sisterhood .\nComparing the original Hocus Pocus with Hocus Pocus 2 is a revealing exercise .\nIt exposes the complete reversal of morals and values communicated to children by mass media in the 21st century .\nDespite the fact that the witches are obsessed with luring and eating children to remain youthful , the movie portrays them as sympathetic , empowered women .\nThe fact that they sold their soul to the Devil for witch powers was a big deal in the first movie .\nIn the second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all .\nThe rest of the movie is all about teenage girls discovering the powers of witchcraft and the joys of forming a coven of witches .\nOf course , this implies that they \u2019 ll eventually have to submit to Satan and eat children to stay alive .\nBut , hey , it \u2019 s 2022 .\nWe \u2019 re cool with that now .\nSo , the family that simply wanted to watch a fun Halloween movie ended up being subjected to a session of indoctrination that culminated with three teenage @ @ @ @ @", "author": "Vigilant Citizen", "url":

relationship with 16-year-old Kylie Jenner when he was in his mid-20s .\nThen , the birthday cake came out of a vehicle and was paraded around for the cameras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this cake was symbolic

controversial \u201c theories \u201d discussed on this site is that celebrities need to sacrifice a person close to them in order to reach a higher level in the entertainment industry .\nThroughout the years , I \u2019 ve cited numerous examples of bizarre deaths occurring right when a star becomes a superstar , whether it be a parent , a sibling , or a close friend .\nOne of them is Ye \u2019 s mother Donda West who lost her life in extremely mysterious circumstances in 2007 , following a plastic surgery procedure in Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ye \u2019 s career reached new vertiginous heights and his relationship with Kim Kardashian made him a household name across the world .\nHowever , despite this success , it was clear that Ye was not at peace with the death of his mother .\nOn numerous occasions , he expressed guilt and regret while accusing those involved in the surgery of negligence and even murder .\nWhile these allusions to this mother \u2019 s sacrifice used to be rather veiled and vague , Ye is now officially a loose cannon .\nHere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stating that his mother \u2019 s death was a sacrifice carried out by the elite to \u201c monetize and traumatize \u201d .\nIn the video , Ye blatantly says that his mother was sacrificed .\nHe also mentions the father of Michael Jordan , the son of Bill Cosby , and the son of Dr. Dre \u2013 all dead in strange circumstances as well .\nYe adds that , in Hollywood , \u201c a lot of people come up missing \u201d .\nThat \u2019 s a fact .\nThen , Ye mentions artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Boosie Badazz who are reduced to silence because the elite can easily send them to jail due to crimes they \u2019 ve committed in the past .\nContrary to them , Ye believes that his clean rap sheet allows him to say whatever he wants without being sent to jail .\nI hope he \u2019 s right .\nBut those who can not be sent to jail are sometimes suicided \u2026 or accidented \u2026 or overdosed .\nWhile , to the average person , the theory of celebrity sacrifices sounds completely insane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted world of the occult elite .\nCelebrities who hail from the profane masses need to pledge full allegiance to the occult elite in order to enjoy the fame and fortune provided by their system .\nAnd what better way to accomplish this than to sacrifice someone that is close to them ?\nLike Ye said , this is done to \u201c monetize and traumatize \u201d .\nIn Ye \u2019 s case , his mother was the obvious choice for a sacrifice .\nTo understand the importance of Donda West to Ye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Netflix .\nThis documentary , based on decades of raw footage of Ye filmed by his friend Coodie Simmons , perfectly encapsulates the immense role of Donda in the rapper \u2019 s life .\nDonda was not only a loving mother but also heavily involved in his career .\nJudging from the footage in Jeen-Yuhs , she was instrumental in keeping the boisterous Ye grounded in reality and focused on wholesome Christian values .\nBy sacrificing his mother , the Hollywood elite cut Ye \u2019 s all-important link to the \u201c real world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way possible .\nHe was introduced in Hollywood \u2019 s sick and twisted bubble completely unattached , allowing his handlers to have full control over him .\nAs seen in my previous article , Ye is clearly attempting to break away from his handlers and he

also didn \u2019 t .\nThat \u2019 s because the last years of his life were characterized by drug use , rehab stints , meltdowns , erratic behavior , and significant problems with his entire family .\nSo , when TMZ reported that Carter was found unresponsive in his bathtub , the word \u201c overdose \u201d was immediately thrown around \u2013 as is always the case in these bizarre celebrity deaths .\nAlthough an autopsy was performed on Carter , the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report ( which could take months ) .\nMeanwhile , Carter \u2019 s body was cremated so there won \u2019 t be any opportunity for a \u201c second opinion \u201d .\nOne thing is for sure : People close to him ruled out suicide as a cause of death .\nHis manager Taylor Helgeson told Page Six : So maybe he died of an accidental overdose .\nAfter all , Carter did admit to being addicted to \u201c huffing \u201d and authorities stated that pill bottles and compressed air cans were found at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind , most would say \u201c case closed \u201d .\nBut things aren \u2019 t that simple .\nWhile Carter could have died due to an accidental overdose , he also could have been killed .\nI \u2019 m saying this because Aaron Carter literally said that the industry wanted to kill him .\nIn the following video , which was posted about four years ago , Carter asks his fans to urgently fund him so he can escape to an \u201c undisclosed location \u201d .\nHere \u2019 s the video .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is a \u201c silent breaker for his brother who is a rapist \u201d .\nHe \u2019 s referring to his brother Nick Carter ( part of the boyband Backstreet Boys ) whom he accused of abusing him his entire life .\nIn the past , Aaron Carter also accused his sister Leslie of abusing him ( she died of an overdose in 2012 ) .\nIn the video above , Aaron says that his family is now \u201c after his life \u201d and \u201c setting him up \u201d .\nHe adds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that they \u2019 re trying to kill him ( Michael Jackson said the exact same things prior to his death ) .\nThen , he asks viewers to donate $ 100,000 so he can move to an undisclosed location where he is safe .\nHe adds that his realtor won \u2019 t sell his house because \u201c they \u2019 re all involved in this \u201d and that police are constantly sent to his house .\nAt one point , the cops talked to him about a rope in his garage that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned about him ?\nOr was it a threat ?\nNo matter what the case may be , everything about Aaron Carter \u2019 s death reeks of occult elite shadiness .\nCarter died on November 5th , 2022 .\nDo you recall what happened exactly one year prior , on November 5th , 2021 ?\nAstroworld \u2013 the highly demonic concert where 10 people died as Travis Scott carried on performing .\nAs explained in my article about Astroworld , the week following Samhein ( Halloween ) is , in occult circles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEvery year , high-profile yet unexplained deaths occur during that time .\nOther than the symbolic date , there \u2019 s the symbolic death scene .\nAaron Carter was found in his bathtub .\nIn 2012 , Whitney Houston was found dead in her bathtub in equally mysterious circumstances .\nLike Carter , \u201c drugs \u201d were immediately mentioned to explain Houston \u2019 s death \u2013 who was becoming increasingly vocal against the industry .\nAlmost exactly three years later , Whitney \u2019 s daughter Bobbi Kristina Houston was also found dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message .\nLike Whitney Houston , Aaron Carter was an industry darling \u2026 until he wasn \u2019 t .\nAnd , like Houston , the industry turned on him and his life turned into a chaotic whirlwind of drugs and meltdowns combined with attempts at speaking out and breaking away from the industry .\nHowever , exactly like Houston , Carter was surrounded by shady industry people who kept him under control .\nOnly two days after Carter \u2019 s death , his label released his last album ironically titled Blacklisted .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Carter \u2019 s management and was described as \u201c obscenely disrespectful \u201d and a \u201c heartless money grab \u201d .\nThe album cover confirms that his label did not care : Carter was nothing but a slave to them .\nThe life and career of Aaron Carter could not be more typical of an industry slave .\nSurrounded by people who were already in the industry \u2013 including his mother with whom he had endless problems \u2013 Aaron began performing at age 7 .\nHe soon landed acting gigs with Nickelodeon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who turn into industry slaves .\nWhile his life as a teen heartthrob appeared to be a dream come true , it was later revealed to be a horrific nightmare .\nAs seen above , Carter accused several people of raping him while he was still a child \u2013 including his own brother , sister , backup dancers , and an unnamed \u201c older woman \u201d in his family .\nSadly , I have a feeling that there were more .\nThis horrific trauma is exactly the \u201c groundwork \u201d necessary to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life , he showed all of the \u201c symptoms \u201d of it .\nIn 2022 , things got incredibly blatant .\nCarter said that he got the tattoo to \u201c honor \u201d his sister who died in 2012 \u2013 the same sister he accused of abusing him when he was a child .\nTherefore , this tattoo actually references the trauma that led him to become an industry Monarch slave .\nAbout a month later , he went into classic MK-slave meltdown mode .\nThis head-shaving incident is highly reminiscent of Britney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she infamously shaved her hair in front of cameras .\nAppropriately enough , Carter went on to compare himself to Spears .\nTwo days before his death , Carter posted this final tweet .\nHis tweet appears to be in response to Kanye exposing his \u201c personal trainer \u201d as an MK handler who threatened of institutionalizing him and drugging him out of his mind .\nWas Aaron Carter trying to connect with Ye because he was caught in a similar situation and was also trying to break free ?\nWhatever the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days later .\nIn his bathtub .\nTwo days later , an album called Blacklisted was released featuring a one-eye sign .\nWhat else do you need to know ?\nEverything about Aaron Carter was typical of an industry slave .\nAs a child , he tasted the spoils of superstardom while also suffering through the horrific abuse that comes with it .\nAs the years went by , this exploitation inevitably took its toll .\nThe trauma and abuse end up creating a broken adult who acts erratically , sporadically melts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug usage .\nLike many other slaves , Aaron started having moments of clarity after age 30 .\nHe attempted to stop using drugs and sought to break away from the industry \u2019 s control .\nIn 2022 , he went viral for his butterfly face tattoo and head-shaving incident .\nWhile he was mercilessly mocked on social media , these events were actually calls for help from an industry slave .\nLike so many other slaves , he was found dead at a very young age and drugs were immediately cited as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While he could have been huffing cans of compressed air while taking a bath , we probably shouldn \u2019 t forget words that Aaron said himself not too long ago :", "author": "Vigilant Citizen",

its inception , it was tied with the elite .\nDuring the 1960s , the brand \u2019 s most enthusiastic clients were elite socialites such as Mona von Bismarck and Pauline de Rothschild ( the wife of Baron Philippe de Rothschild ) .\nIn the 21st century , Balencia became a \u201c must \u201d in celebrity circles \u2013 especially with pawns of the elite .\nIts list of clients includes the likes of Madonna , Nicole Kidman , Jennifer Garner , Justin Bieber , and Kim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c by the elite , for the elite \u201d .\nAnd , in case you haven \u2019 t realized yet , today \u2019 s elite is completely obsessed with the sexualization of children .\nThey \u2019 re using schools , mass media , and everything in between to normalize their sickness and , slowly but surely , push the boundaries of what is socially acceptable .\nSince Balenciaga is part of this mess , the brand could not help but to contribute to this culture that constantly seeks to sexualize children and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse .\nWhy would they even think of doing that ?\nShort answer : A whole lot of them are pedophiles .\nEven worse , the occult elite engages in the systematic abuse of children for aims that are too evil to even fathom .\nIt is only by understanding these facts that the following pictures will make complete sense .\nThrough symbolism , Balenciaga celebrates an entire culture \u2013 one that is deeply sick , cruel , and horrific .\nThe pictures promoting Balenciaga \u2019 s \u201c holiday \u201d products are unsettling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smaller details , it only gets worse .\nThe bear is wearing a padlock across its neck , a fishnet top , a harness , and all kinds of straps .\nNeedless to say , this gear is used in hardcore BDSM sex that revolves around pain , submission , and humiliation .\nWith that being said , why is a child holding this thing ?\nThis stuffed animal represents a literal sex slave , as symbolized by the collar and padlock .\nNotice that the definition above mentions \u201c pet-like status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d .\nCoincidentally enough , there \u2019 s an actual leash on the girl \u2019 s bed .\nAnd I don \u2019 t see a dog in sight .\nThis picture combines kiddie stuff with \u201c adult \u201d objects such as wine and champagne glasses .\nAlso , there are candles inside beer cans .\nWhy are these things inside the girl \u2019 s room ?\nAlso ,

weren \u2019 t two toys in full BDSM gear in the same picture .\nIn short , the entire vibe of the picture is unsettling and full of inuendoes .\nSomehow , the one below manages to be worse .\nFirst , there \u2019 s caution tape on a chair .\nThat kind of tape is usually used at crime scenes .\nIs this boy \u2019 s room a crime scene ?\nDid abuse occur here ?\nFurthermore , the drawings on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychologists to be deeply concerned .\nIn the past , Balenciaga made it a point to associate these stuffed animals with full-on abuse .\nThe photoshoot above was the work of Gabriele Galimberti , an Italian photographer who is loved by the elite .\nBecause he pushes its agendas .\nSome Balenciaga pictures do not contain children .\nHowever , they contain details that go exactly in the same direction as the pictures above , even confirming our worst fears .\nIf one zooms into the document at the bottom , one discovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This specific ruling was not chosen by mistake .\nIt fits perfectly the insane child abuse theme of the Balenciaga campaign .\nIndeed , Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition reverses a significant portion of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 .\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the ban on \u201c virtual child pornography \u201d violated free speech so it was reversed .\nIn other words , it was a win for the pedos .\nAnd that \u2019 s why this specific document was in that Balenciaga photo .\nThey want more judicial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details .\nOnce again , the presence of this book is not random .\nIt perfectly fits the overarching theme .\nMichael Borremans \u2019 most famous work is titled Fire From the Sun .\nIn the painting above , we see naked children that are covered in blood and three limbs on the floor .\nIf you look closely , above the limbs , we see a translucent figure crouching above the limbs .\nKim Noble , a survivor of trauma-based mind control who paints symbolic images , uses the same imagery to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind control ) .\nIn other words , these children are being traumatized and they \u2019 re dissociating .\nHere \u2019 s a description of this series of paintings .\nAs the description above stated , this scene takes place on a stage and is suggestive of a \u201c director \u201d watching .\nThis is truly psychopathic .\nWhat if these paintings were based on something that happened in reality ?\nThe description above , from an art website , actually refers to the trauma of children \u2013 a core concept of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day but I believe you get the picture .\nBorremans \u2019 work revolves around trauma , abuse , rituals , cannibalism , and a whole lot of naked children being watched by some freak .\nIn other words , this is all about the sickness of the occult elite .\nAnd this is why his book was featured in the Balenciaga pic .\nFollowing the controversy around this madness , Balenciaga issued an apology .\nThat was probably part of the plan from the get go .\nIn past years , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedophilic pictures to then \u201c apologize \u201d ( i.e .\nZara

several others approved them .\nThey knew what they were doing .\nEven if Balenciaga removed all of these pictures , it \u2019 s too late .\nThey \u2019 re already out there and they know it .\nThe

close to a \u201c conspiracy theory \u201d , it \u2019 s truth staring in our faces .\nThe messages in Balenciaga \u2019 s campaign are not random and they \u2019 re not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line with the

Broadduses , a family that received a series of disturbing letters after purchasing a home in 2014 .\nThe letters and the saga that ensued were documented in a 2018 New York Magazine article that detailed the creepy contents of the letters .\nAfter years of investigations and all kinds of twists and turns , the culprit was never found \u2026 Or is it all a cover-up ?\nWhile the Netflix series is considered to be a work of fiction , its premise closely follows what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stately , six bedrooms house in the affluent town of Westfield , New Jersey , the Broaddus family started receiving bizarre and increasingly threatening letters from a stalker named The Watcher .\nThe first letter alluded to the long history of the house and the potential secrets it might hold .\nMore disturbingly , the letter also mentions the three children of the family , calling them \u201c young blood \u201d .\nHere \u2019 s the first letter .\nDearest new neighbor at 657 Boulevard , allow me to welcome you to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ?\nDid 657 Boulevard call to you with its force within ?\n657 Boulevard has been the subject of my family for decades now and as it approaches its 110th birthday , I have been put in charge of watching and waiting for its second coming .\nMy grandfather watched the house in the 1920s and my father watched in the 1960s .\nIt is now my time .\nDo you know the history of the house ?\nDo you know what lies within the walls of 657 Boulevard ?\nWhy are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI see already that you have flooded 657 Boulevard with contractors so that you can destroy the house as it was supposed to be .\nTsk , tsk , tsk \u2026 bad move .\nYou don \u2019 t want to make 657 Boulevard unhappy .\nYou have children .\nI have seen them .\nSo far I think there are three that I have counted .\nDo you need to fill the house with the young blood I requested ?\nBetter for me .\nWas your old house too small for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring me your children ?\nOnce I know their names I will call to them and draw them too [ sic ] me .\nWho am I ?\nThere are hundreds and hundreds of cars that drive by 657 Boulevard each day .\nMaybe I am in one .\nLook at all the windows you can see from 657 Boulevard .\nMaybe I am in one .\nLook out any of the many windows in 657 Boulevard at all the people who stroll by each day .\nMaybe I am one .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party begin , In short , this letter is a parent \u2019 s worst nightmare .\nTwo weeks later , the family finds a second letter .\nAnd it is worse .\nI am pleased to know your names now and the name of the young blood you have brought to me .\nYou certainly say their names often .\n657 Boulevard is anxious for you to move in .\nIt has been years and years since the young blood ruled the hallways of the house .\nHave you found all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young blood play in the basement ?\nOr are they too afraid to go down there alone .\nI would [ be ] very afraid if I were them .\nIt is far away from the rest of the house .\nIf you were upstairs you would never hear them scream .\nWill they sleep in the attic ?\nOr will you all sleep on the second floor ?\nWho has the bedrooms facing the street ?\nI \u2019 ll know as soon as you move in .\nIt will help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThen I can plan better .\nAll of the windows and doors in 657 Boulevard allow me to watch you and track you as you move through the house .\nWho am I ?\nI am the Watcher and have been in control of 657 Boulevard for the better part of two decades now .\nThe Woods family turned it over to you .\nIt was their time to move on and kindly sold it when I asked them to .\nI pass by many times a day .\n657 Boulevard is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsession .\nAnd now you are too Braddus family .\nWelcome to the product of your greed !\nGreed is what brought the past three families to 657 Boulevard and now it has brought you to me .\nHave a happy moving in day .\nYou know I will be watching .\nJudging by the contents of this letter , The Watcher lives close to the house and has intimate knowledge of it .\nDespite the fact that there can \u2019 t be that many suspects , police were never able to pinpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baffling considering that the letters were delivered in lick-sealed , handwritten envelopes .\nSome believe that this is all a cover-up and that the police are in on it .\nThe Netflix series takes this premise and takes it to some very dark places .\nCreated by Ryan Murphy ( American Horror Stories ) , The Watcher incorporates facts from the real story while introducing several disturbing elements \u2026 that might be true .\nFor instance , in the series , The Watcher is suspected to be a member of a satanic cult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rituals .\nThis might sound like a reach .\nHowever , the real letters did repeatedly lust over the children \u2019 s blood .\nBeyond the actual letters , the series explores various themes relating to modern society , turning this story about a family buying a house into a commentary on the pitfalls of modern life .\nIndeed , as the series progresses , the house ends up representing a toxic society controlled by a twisted elite while the Brannocks represent the typical American family that attempts to flourish inside of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the themes of the series .\nIn the series , it is quickly established that the Brannocks are buying a house that \u2019 s too expensive for them .\nWanting to offer their children a spacious house in a safe neighborhood , the Brannocks used all of their savings , stocks , and IRAs to finance the house .\nTo justify his decision , Dean says : Right from the start , we are introduced to one powerful way society is controlled by the elite : Crippling debt .\nThe Brannocks quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong \u201d in that house and the elite society it represents .\nThen , they receive a letter from The Watcher ( the same real-life letter quoted above ) that confirms this fact .\nWhen they go to the police , the Brannocks realize that something is off .\nThe detective strongly encourages the Brannocks to install cameras around the house to feel more secure .\nWhile the cameras are there for \u201c security \u201d , they also cause the Brannocks to be watched at all times .\nLike many other themes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to society in general .\nThere \u2019 s another important theme in the series that can be applied to society in general : The sexualization of minors .\nA major storyline in the series involves the sexualization of 16-year-old Ellie Brannock and her father \u2019 s reaction to it .\nWhile this narrative has nothing to do with the true story of The Watcher , it fits perfectly the wider meaning of this series : The corruption of American society .\nShortly after moving in , Ellie finds lipstick inside the house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Hey , sailor \u201d are not random flirtatious words .\nThere \u2019 s some history behind these words .\nIn short , the house ( which represents an elite-controlled society ) \u201c offered \u201d Ellie the lipstick which represents her sexualization .\nThen , things get rather uncomfortable .\nWhile Ellie puts on lipstick and imitates a prostitute , her parents are having sex in the other room .\nHowever , they are interrupted by Ellie calling them .\nSo they stop and go see her .\nDean , whose presumably still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , starts obsessing about his daughter \u2019 s lipstick .\nThen , the series dedicates lots of time playing around with the taboo of a minor getting involved with an adult .\nIn a later scene , Ellie lures Dakota into a pool and asks him to kiss her .\nThen Dakota asks : Then they kiss .\nThat \u2019 s the kind of dialog a pedo would come up with .\nMeanwhile , Ellie \u2019 s father is increasingly obsessing over his daughter \u2019 s sexualization .\nAnd his wife finds it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To sum up this storyline : The house ( which represents the elite \u2019 s society ) offers Ellie the \u201c tool \u201d for her sexualization .\nAfter getting involved with an adult , her father attempts to stop all of that .\nHowever , he gets accused of obsessing over her sexuality , leaving him feeling angry yet powerless .\nIn the end , this all falls into the elite \u2019 s wider plans of normalizing the sexualization of minors .\nBecause they \u2019 re pedophiles who prey on children .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it .\nThey don \u2019 t only want to sexualize children .\nThey want their blood .\nIn an attempt to gather more information about The Watcher , Dean Hannock meets up with Andrew Pierce , a previous owner of their house .\nHe tells him that the house \u2013 and the entire neighborhood \u2013 holds dark disturbing secrets .\nPierce shows Dean Brannock a letter he received from The Watcher .\nApparently , to be accepted into that house , blood must be offered .\nThen , Pierce explains what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierce also explains that there are secret tunnels leading to the basement of the house .\nConsidering the fact that the house represents an elite-controlled society , the fact that there are tunnels in the basement is highly symbolic .\nIt represents the secret network of blood-sucking pedophiles that operate right in society \u2019 s \u201c basement \u201d .\nWhile Dean is uncovering these disturbing truths , he \u2019 s also kind of losing it .\nEspecially because he can not prove any of it conclusively and authorities refuse to investigate these claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s turning into a stereotypical \u201c conspiracy theorist \u201d .\nWorried about the sexualization of his daughter , his neighbors being adrenochrome Satanists , and The Watcher taunting him , Dean wants to know the truth .\nHowever , this obsession is costing him .\nHe can not focus on work , he can not please his wife and he \u2019 s becoming highly irritable .\nMeanwhile , his family is turning against him .\nOf course , everybody sees the video , and Dean \u2019 s reputation is destroyed .\nIn short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a house that represents the elite \u2019 s society ) is on the verge of imploding .\nConsidering the fact that the elite is in an all-out war against the nuclear family , this makes sense .\nIn the end , the Brannocks eventually sell the house and move back to New York City .\nWhile the family stayed together , its issues are not solved .\nDean remains obsessed with The Watcher and can not get on with life without solving the case .\nHe knows that there \u2019 s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not prove it \u2013 a fact that drives him mad .\nDespite the fact that they \u2019 re out of the house , they \u2019 ve been \u201c infected \u201d by its evil energy .\nOn a wider scale , once the masses get in contact with the elite \u2019 s society , they get infected by it .\nEven after realizing that it is highly toxic , they can not help but be fascinated and wonder about the dark forces behind it all .\nWhile The Watcher appears to be a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tacked on to the story give it another dimension .\nIn The Watcher , the house represents a society controlled by a sick occult elite .\nTo represent this fact , a satanic cult that lusts for \u201c young blood \u201d has access to the house using tunnels .\nThe Brannocks moving into that house represent the American family attempting to flourish in the elite \u2019 s society .\nHowever , there are many pitfalls .\nThe family is now financially vulnerable , it is constantly monitored through cameras , the daughter becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do better .\nOn top of it all , they realize that \u201c respected members of the community \u201d are actually Satanists who crave the blood of children .\nIn short , The Watcher is the occult elite laughing at you .\nThrough symbolism , they \u2019 re telling you how they poison society and break down families .\nThey tell you that you might be right for pointing this out but you \u2019 ll still be called crazy for doing so .\nAnd , as you watch this Netflix series about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that they \u2019 re turning everyone into \u2026 watchers .", "author": "Vigilant Citizen", "url":

it , an expression immediately comes to mind : \u201c Revelation of the Method \u201d .\nOriginating from ancient Rosicrucian texts , this obscure concept refers to the process of exposing the masses to dark realities ( often in a veiled and underhanded manner ) to elicit implied acceptance .\nOnce these formally hidden truths are revealed to the public and met with general apathy , indifference , or incredulity , they become normalized and embedded in society \u2019 s collective unconscious .\nSome occultists compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Work \u201d where the world is \u201c transmuted \u201d according to the will of the occult elite .\nSince the advent of mass media , the Revelation of the Method has become increasingly apparent .\nWhile , in the past , the elite operated in complete secrecy , it now seeks to operate in plain sight .\nSeveral events of 2022 fit perfectly the concept of Revelation of the Method .\n\u201c Conspiracy theories \u201d are turning into obvious truths right before our eyes .\nDark secrets are being revealed yet most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they mean .\nAnd that \u2019 s exactly what \u201c they \u201d want .\nThe Vigilant Citizen is about exposing what is truly happening .\nThat way , instead of passively accepting their madness due to ignorance , we can actively reject it due to knowledge .\nHere \u2019 s a look at some revealing events of 2022 and what they meant in the grand scheme of things .\nOn March 25th , the world was shocked by the unexpected death of Taylor Hawkins , the drummer of the Foo Fighters .\nWhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the timing of this event was simply perplexing .\nExactly one month prior to Hawkins \u2019 death , the Foo Fighters released a horror-comedy movie called Studio 666 .\nThe subject of the movie : Members of the Foo Fighters get killed as blood sacrifices to a Satanic music industry .\nThis entire movie was highly symbolic , especially considering what would happen exactly one month after its release .\nWas this movie a horrific coincidence ?\nOr were they revealing their method ?\nFor years , I \u2019 ve been writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cannibalism and drinking blood .\nIn occult circles , it is believed that extracting and consuming blood in specific circumstances can have powerful rejuvenating effects \u2013 and the potency is multiplied when the \u201c donor \u201d is young .\nThere \u2019 s nothing new about those practices as they \u2019 ve existed for centuries ( see my article on Elizabeth Bathory ) .\nDespite these facts , mass media has been ridiculing this \u201c conspiracy theory \u201d .\nThen , Megan Fox straight up said that she drinks blood in rituals .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said : Combine Megan Fox \u2019 s highly publicized obsession with blood with the countless recent movies revolving around cannibalism , and you get a clear case of Revelation of the Method .\nEvery time I think about the footage of Anne Heche attempting to break away from a stretcher that \u2019 s carried by a couple of firemen , I get deeply disturbed .\nAnd so many questions come to mind .\nWhy did they cover her ( as if she was already dead ) while she was on the stretcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured on the stretcher ?\nMore importantly , why was she trying to get away ?\nAs usual , mass media was quick to conclude that Heche \u2019 s erratic behavior was due to drugs and/or alcohol , despite the fact that witnesses stated the contrary .\nA few months after my article where I explained that Heche was clearly running from something ( and not just high out of her mind ) the truth finally came out .\nSo , if Heche was sober during that day , what actually happened ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ It appears that we \u2019 ve all witnessed the sacrifice of another celebrity .\nIn my article about Alfred Kinsey , I explained how his \u201c research \u201d was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and serves as a basis for sexual education in America to this day .\nWith that being said , here \u2019 s a table from his book Sexual Behavior of the Human Male .\nTable 34 documents the \u201c sexual responses \u201d of children from infants through teens as recorded by their adult male abusers .\nThese pedophiles conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing them to what the experimenters called \u201c orgasm \u201d ( screaming , weeping , fighting the sexual \u201c partner \u201d ) and timing these responses with a stopwatch .\nIn short , Table 34 records nothing less than the systematic abuse of over 300 children aged between 5 months to 14 years old .\nThe data it contains is simply horrifying .\nHow can an 11-month-old baby have 14 orgasms in 38 minutes unless it was the result of outright torture ?\nWith all of that being said , the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kinsey .\nWhy ?\nBecause the occult elite are pedophiles and they want their sick culture to be celebrated .\nIn October , Doja Cat celebrated her birthday with an all-out parade of industry slaves .\nClearly influenced by the movie Eyes Wide Shut ( which is based on the occult elite \u2019 s sex magick rituals ) , the party was about industry slaves imitating their handlers , the same way toddlers imitate their parents .\nMore importantly , it was another case of Revelation of the Method .\nFor years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having to sacrifice a loved one to attain a higher level in the industry .\nI \u2019 ve also written about handlers controlling celebrities in extreme ways .\nWhile these claims were regarded as crazy \u201c conspiracy theories \u201d by many , Kanye West just said it in unequivocal terms : He also mentioned the father of Michael Jordan , the son of Bill Cosby , and the son of Dr. Dre \u2013 all dead in mysterious circumstances .\nAccording to him , these sacrifices are carried out to \u201c control and traumatize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed his \u201c personal trainer \u201d Harley Pasternak as an all-out MK handler .\nHe even posted a threatening text message he received from Pasternak .\nI \u2019 ve been writing about the elite celebrating their pedophilia for years and mainstream media tried hard to suppress this obvious fact .\nIndeed , my article about Pizzagate was attacked by publications such as the New York Times , even calling The Vigilant Citizen \u201c fake news \u201d .\nThen , Balenciaga released an ad campaign that was so vile that everyone had to shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Times .\nIn a series of upsetting photographs , the geniuses at Balenciaga had children holding plush animals wearing BDSM gear , along with other highly symbolic objects around them ( i.e .\ndog leashes ) .\nTo make things worse , other pictures actually contained a court ruling regarding child pornography .\nYes , there was a backlash .\nThat \u2019 s because there \u2019 s a growing number of vigilant citizens out there who forced mainstream media to address this issue .\nWe must keep going .\nDespite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d discussed on this site were essentially confirmed in 2022 , The Vigilant Citizen was banned from Google search results and was completely demonetized .\nThe reports I got from Google were infuriating .\nFor instance , one article was demonetized due to \u201c unreliable and harmful claims \u201d .\nThe reason : I wrote that \u2026 men can not be women .\nThe absurdity of the situation truly messed with my mind as I realized that the quote \u201c In a time of universal deceit , telling the truth becomes a revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Google attempted to suffocate this site by banning it from its advertising monopoly , I had to find a way to secure the survival of The Vigilatn Citizen .\nDeleting \u201c problematic \u201d content and self-censoring myself to please Google was , of course , out of the question .\nSo , after some soul-searching , I came up with a possible solution that would allow the site to survive without any censorship : Reader subscriptions .\nSo , in June , I removed every single ad from this site and solely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some risk involved as an insufficient number of subscribers would result in the site going down .\nHowever , it was a do-or-die situation : Either this site remained an independent source of uncensored truth , or it just stops existing .\nFortunately , YOU came through .\nVigilant Citizens across the world subscribed to the site , allowing it to survive without a single ad on its pages .\nI can finally write \u201c unreliable and harmful claims \u201d such as \u201c men can not be women \u201d without being threatened with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo I \u2019 d like to take this occasion to thank , from the bottom of my heart , every subscriber for supporting this site and allowing it to survive .\nOf course , the best way for me to thank you is by working even harder on new articles and delivering the hard-hitting content you \u2019 re looking for .\nAnd , with your support , that \u2019 s exactly what I \u2019 ll be focusing on in 2023 .\nNot only will I keep publishing articles on a wide range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also launch a new project that has been requested for years : VC Videos .\nThis new project is coming soon , it will be high quality and it will be unique .\nAnd it \u2019 s being made possible due to your incredible support this year .\nIn short , this year confirmed lots of things that were discussed on this site since 2008 , and we \u2019 ll surely see more of this in 2023 .\nI will be there to decipher all of it and I will do my best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to navigate these strange times .\nUntil then , I wish you a merry Christmas , a happy new year , and I \u2019 ll see you in 2023 !", "author": "Vigilant Citizen", "url":

His \u201cResearch\u201d Included Child Abuse.", "content": "On September 7th , 2022 , Indiana University unveiled a bronze sculpture memorializing Alfred Kinsey , a biologist , and sexologist whose works sparked a profound shift in American culture .\nSitting on the Bloomington campus , the sculpture marks the 75th anniversary of The Kinsey Institute which is touted as \u201c the world \u2019 s leading sexual research institute \u201d .\nJustin Garcia , executive director of the Kinsey Institute said : That \u2019 s a weird way of describing a man whose \u201c research \u201d included counting the number of orgasms a 4-year-old boy could have in 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 .\nIn case you wondered , this \u201c data \u201d was obtained by a pedophile who systematically abused over 300 children and communicated his findings to Kinsey .\nOf course , none of these facts were mentioned when Kinsey \u2019 s sculpture was unveiled .\nIn fact , mass media has been whitewashing Kinsey \u2019 s past and highly questionable methods for decades .\nIn an age where figures of the past are scrutinized and \u201c canceled \u201d for all kinds of reasons , Kinsey gets a statue .\nWhy is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of an elite-backed agenda that is still highly relevant today .\nEverything that is happening today regarding sex , genders , and the normalization of everything abnormal ( including pedophilia ) can be traced back to Kinsey \u2019 s seminal works .\nHere \u2019 s a look at this highly influential figure .\nDuring the 1940s , Kinsey obtained research funding from the Rockefeller Foundation .\nThis fact alone is enough to understand the forces behind Kinsey \u2019 s work .\nA quick refresher course about the Rockefellers : They \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family .\nJohn D. Rockefeller is still considered the wealthiest American of all time and the richest person in modern history .\nIn the past decades , this powerful elite dynasty used its enormous resources to create the Rockefeller Foundation which shaped American society in ways we can not even fathom .\nThe foundation created entire fields of study and threw billions of dollars at research that aligned with its agenda .\nWhat agenda am I referring to ?\nIn his own memoirs , David D. Rockefeller wrote : While it might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s works on sexuality play an important role in the globalist agenda .\nLast year , I published an article titled The 1963 List \u201c Current Communist Goals \u201d is Becoming a Reality Right Before Our Eyes which lists the numerous ways America can be weakened from within .\nThe ultimate goal : To integrate it into a global world order .\nHere are three of these objectives : In 1948 , Kinsey published Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and , a few years later , Sexual Behavior in the Human Female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made Kinsey a celebrity .\nMore importantly , they sparked a great shift in American morals and values .\nDuring the 1950s , Kinsey teamed up with Mary Calderone ( medical director for Planned Parenthood ) to create the sex education curriculum that is still taught in schools today .\nHugh Hefner , the founder of Playboy magazine considered himself \u201c Kinsey \u2019 s pamphleteer \u201d .\nIn the inaugural issue of his magazine , Hefner wrote : Needless to say , Kinsey \u2019 s work was highly controversial .\nJohn Bancroft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute stated that he \u201c rebelled against what he regarded as the destructively repressive sexual mores of his time.\n\u201d Kinsey believed that there were only three kinds of sexual abnormalities : abstinence , celibacy , and delayed marriage .\nBy including \u201c boy and dog \u201d in the quote above , Kinsey included bestiality in what is \u201c normal \u201d .\nAnd , according to his \u201c data \u201d , 50 % of men ( mainly farm boys ) had engaged in sex with an animal .\nKinsey wrote : Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the normal mammalian picture \u201d .\nBut it gets much worse .\nKinsey went out of his way to portray children as \u201c sexual beings \u201d .\nBancroft stated that Kinsey was \u201c particularly interested in the observation of adults who had been sexually involved with children \u201d .\nThat \u2019 s an understatement .\nKinsey stated that his findings were \u201c an important substantiation of the Freudian view of sexuality as a component that is present in the human animal from earliest infancy.\n\u201d To support his claims , Kinsey obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infamous Table 34 , which is one of the worst things that ever happened in the history of science .\nFound in the book Sexual Behavior of the Human Male , Table 34 documents the \u201c sexual responses \u201d of children from infants through teens as recorded by their adult male abusers .\nThese pedophiles conducted sexual experiments on hundreds of children by bringing them to what the experimenters called \u201c orgasm \u201d ( screaming , weeping , fighting the sexual \u201c partner \u201d ) and timing these responses with a stopwatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the systematic abuse of over 300 children aged between 5 months to 14 years old .\nThe data it contains is simply horrifying .\nHow can an 11-month-old baby have 14 orgasms in 38 minutes unless it was the result of outright torture ?\nWhen asked how he obtained this \u201c data \u201d , Kinsey blatantly lied and claimed that it came from various sources .\nBut that wasn \u2019 t true .\nAll of this \u201c data \u201d was obtained by one ( insane ) pedophile .\nIn 1995 , John Bancroft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : You \u2019 ve read correctly .\nThe director of the Kinsey Institute called the monster who abused over 300 children \u201c an extraordinary man \u201d .\nJust think about it for a second .\nHow can one \u201c extraordinary \u201d man have access to over 300 children ( some literal babies ) to experiment on ?\nIn what conditions did he make a 4-year-old child have 26 orgasms in 24 hours ?\nWere these children kidnaped and forced into MKULTRA-style sexual experiments ?\nPat Trueman , a former US Attorney for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Obscenity Unit stated : Throughout the years , the Kinsey Institute refused to reveal this \u201c extraordinary \u201d pedophile \u2019 s name .\nHe \u2019 s cataloged at the Institute under a pseudonym and all investigations were cut short .\nIn short , Kinsey used this \u201c data \u201d to normalize child sexuality .\nBut that \u2019 s not all .\nIn Sexual Behavior in the Human Female , he even attempted to normalize incest by claiming that \u201c children are sexual and potentially orgasmic from birth ( womb to tomb ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and often benefit thereby.\n\u201d Yes , he said that children that are raped by their own family can \u201c benefit \u201d from it .\nTo prove his claims , Kinsey and his associates interviewed 4,441 female children who were abused .\nThe conclusion : Only one of them experienced harm .\nThe least one can say is that Kinsey \u2019 s conclusions are questionable .\nThat \u2019 s because his entire methods are questionable .\nIn the years that followed the publication of his books , some facts emerged regarding Kinsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findings .\nFirst , it was discovered that , among the 17,000 people that were interviewed for his research , prostitutes and prison inmates ( mainly sex offenders ) were grossly overrepresented .\nIt was also discovered that Kinsey interviewed a disproportionate number of homosexual men which completely distorted his studies .\nFor instance , his book claimed that \u201c 37 % of males and 13 % of females had at least some overt homosexual experience to orgasm \u201d .\nThese numbers did not represent American society at all .\nKinsey claimed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into heterosexuality and monogamy due to social and religious pressures .\nConsidering the fact that Kinsey was bisexual himself ( and involved in an open marriage ) one question begs to be asked : Did Kinsey distort facts to fit personal biases and a wider agenda ?\nOne thing is for sure : His methods were completely unscientific .\nAs stated above , Kinsey \u2019 s \u201c research \u201d included filming his coworkers having sex in his attic .\nWhy is this person still considered credible in any shape or form ?\nAlfred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt was motivated by an obvious agenda and tainted with his own perversions .\nAs if that wasn \u2019 t enough , his books contained the \u201c findings \u201d of an anonymous pedophile who sexually tortured hundreds of children .\nThese facts should be enough to completely discredit this man and throw all of his \u201c research \u201d in the garbage .\nBut that is not what is happening .\nHis story was whitewashed in the 2004 Hollywood movie Kinsey .\nIn 2019 , Kinsey was one of the inaugural fifty American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor .\nAnd , in 2022 , Indiana University unveiled a statue of him to honor his memory .\nThe only reason why Kinsey is celebrated ( and not canceled ) is because his works are aligned with the elite \u2019 s agenda .\nAnd that is why a pedophilia apologist was honored with a statue .", "author": "Vigilant Citizen", "url":
