failing to comply with vax mandates .\nHealth officers poised to detain adults and children for up to a month if they fail to comply with mRNA COVID jabs The Washington State Board of Health is

simply because you are \u201c suspected to be infected with , exposed to , or contaminated with \u201d SARS-CoV-2 ( emphasis ours ) and have failed to offer your \u201c voluntary compliance \u201d with jabs .\nMeanwhile , Israel faces skyrocketing COVID-19 cases and hospitalization rates \u2013 are we still willing to believe these jabs did their job or did we forget what mainstream media used to say about them ?\nEarly propaganda surrounding the jabs was consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we can prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission and \u201c end the pandemic.\n\u201d But when it became clear that the jabs do NOT stop transmission and that fully vaxxed people could catch and spread COVID-19 as easily as unjabbed folks , the message quietly shifted from \u201c preventing spread \u201d to \u201c preventing severe illness , hospitalization , and death.\n\u201d But somehow , states like Washington , New York , and Massachusetts continue to insist that free Americans should be forced or coerced into getting these jabs \u2013 even though they do NOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free society .\nIsrael \u2013 one of the most vaxxed countries in the world \u2013 continues to face high hospitalization rates

figures from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country is becoming so small that perhaps it \u2019 s inevitable most people going to hospitals these days have received multiple doses of the COVID shot .\nOf

media , a \u201c lie with statistics \u201d trick to drive lockdowns .\nBut certainly , this same logic should be applied when discussing hospitalization trends in Israel and other highly vaxxed areas of the world .\nThat is , are the Israelis who are double , triple , or even quadruple-jabbed and ending up in hospitals with a COVID+ diagnosis there because of that diagnosis , or there for another reason and incidentally found to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 ?\nHow many of these hospitalizations , for instance , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nOr adverse reactions to the boosters ?\nIf there are hospitalizations due to COVID shots , are they being adequately reported ?\nAnd now that the mainstream narrative of the pandemic is starting to crumble , will officials begin to be more forthcoming

latest round of updated COVID-19 data that the mainstream media might be reluctant to share , a recent study straight out of Ground Zero \u2013 the Wuhan Institute of Virology ( WIV ) in Wuhan , China \u2013 has revealed that getting the COVID shot has a \u201c consistent \u201d effect on someone \u2019 s immune health .\nThe effect ?\nMaking a person \u2019 s immune system more vulnerable .\nAs public health officials continue to ramp up their COVID test and N95 disbursement efforts , let \u2019 s pay close attention to when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly acknowledged and discussed .\nCAUTION : Getting the COVID shot causes \u201c consistent pathophysiological alterations \u201d in the human immune system The study in question was published in October 2021 in Cell Discovery and conducted by Chinese researchers from WIV .\nIt \u2019 s important to know in this case , the researchers used a vaccine available in China called VeroCell .\nAccording to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , VeroCell \u201c is an inactivated vaccine \u2026 which [ stimulates ] the production of antibodies and [ makes ] the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with live SARS-CoV-2 .\nThis vaccine is adjuvanted ( with aluminum hydroxide ) , to boost the response of the immune system.\n\u201d While the WIV study is small and includes only 11 participants , it did generate some alarming conclusions regarding COVID shot safety .\nBy assessing kidney function , blood work , and other metrics in the participants , the researchers determined that the shots clearly \u201c mimicked an infection \u201d with SARS-CoV-2 and led to \u201c consistent alterations in gene expression of many different immune cell types.\n\u201d \u201c These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c suggested that after vaccination , at least by day 28 , other than generation of neutralizing antibodies , people \u2019 s immune systems , including those of lymphocytes and monocytes , were perhaps in a more vulnerable state.\n\u201d They continue ( with our emphasis added ) : \u201c Our study postulates that it is imperative to consider the potential long-term impact of vaccination to certain medical conditions or to general human health.\n\u201d This study also adds context to the official position of the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID booster shots could impair immune response and lack feasibility as a public health measure .\nGrowing evidence of negative immune health effects caused by COVID shot raises yet another important ethical question that public health officials seem unwilling to address Let \u2019 s unpack this scenario a bit more clearly : Here we have one of several scientific studies presenting evidence that COVID shots \u2013 which currently lack any and all long-term safety data \u2013 are associated with \u201c dramatic changes in immune cell gene expression \u201d that could actually impair a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that person has one or more chronic health conditions .\nNext , we need to consider an interesting trend in drug studies : Usually , only young and healthy volunteers are recruited to participate in clinical drug trials that purport to assess the safety and efficacy of a drug ( as was the case for this study from WIV ) .\nYet the majority of people who would be expected to take the drug \u2013 including a whopping 6 in 10 American adults with at least one chronic disease and nearly 43 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) \u2013 are either older than 65 or not healthy by most definitions .\nThis brings up an important question : If a growing amount of evidence suggests that COVID shots could plausibly cause long-term harm to immune health , particularly in people with chronic health conditions , isn \u2019 t it unethical to coerce American citizens into taking them since the majority of these citizens live with at least one chronic health issue ?\nHeart disease , cancer , kidney disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chronic lung disease are rampant in this country .\nShouldn \u2019 t individuals living with these conditions get to choose whether they want to take their chances on the COVID shot in the hopes that the benefits of the drug will outweigh the risks ?\nAnd regardless of health status or age , shouldn \u2019 t everyone get to make that risk assessment for themselves and their children ?\nIt truly has never been more important to improve your overall health and the health of your loved ones .\nBe sure to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topics to protect your well-being now and in the future .", "author":

more obscure .\nThe less you know , the more you will accept .\nYour government is riding on the hope , the assumption , that the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re absolutely correct .\nThe truth is , pesticides have made their way into not only the crops but also the animal herds .\nAnd the effects are long-lasting as well as devastating .\nThe pesticide treadmill is real , and it is detrimental to your health .\nWhat is the \u201c pesticide treadmill \u201d and why is it detrimental to your health ?\nThe pesticide treadmill is a trap that gets farmers caught up in a vicious cycle of pesticide use .\nThey begin innocently enough with minimal product .\nThat doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As weeds and insects develop resistance to pesticides , the farmers must use a higher quantity and more toxic chemicals to maintain control .\nThe resistance that insects and weeds develop due to pesticide use breeds superbugs and superweeds which do not respond to the chemicals being used .\nWhen this happens , and farmers begin seeing it in their crops , they use more potent chemicals like 2,4-D , linked to reproductive problems , brain damage , and several types of cancer .\nTo put this into perspective , farmers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of their crops to pests .\nToday , that number has increased to 13 % despite the increased use of pesticides .\nIt is estimated that since 1945 as many as 1,000 weed and insect species have developed a resistance to pesticides .\nThe sad truth is that this is entirely unnecessary .\nThere are several alternatives available for managing garden , lawn , and home pests without harmful , toxic pesticides .\nBut wait , the damage does not stop there !\nPesticide use leads to MANY serious problems Several serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs the farmer must use stronger and more toxic chemicals , those chemicals are transferred to the people who eat the crops .\nBut they are also transferred to the animals that graze on the lands and are fed either from food grown on the farm or stored in close proximity to the pesticide use or storage .\nThese chemicals have been linked to a number of health problems , an increased risk of death , and birth defects .\nThese chemicals are seeping into our water , soil , and food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pesticides haven \u2019 t touched .\nThe U.S. Geological Survey conducted tests on rural waterways and found that pesticides contaminated more than 61 % at high enough levels that it was harmful to the aquatic life there .\nIn the soil , pesticides decrease microbial diversity , which destroys the organic matter that holds water in the soil , increasing the farmland \u2019 s resiliency to drought .\nAnd if that isn \u2019 t enough , this pesticide problem is not only confined to the farms using the chemicals .\nThe chemicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farms via water runoff and other ways .\nSo even farms that are not caught up in the pesticide treadmill are still affected .\nHere is how to reduce your exposure to toxic chemicals in your food One of the best ways to escape the effects of the pesticide treadmill is to turn to small , local farms instead of massive commercial farms .\nThese farms use cottage gardening , a small-scale plan that uses smaller plots of land for farming .\nAs a result , it is easier to manage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a much smaller scale .\nWhile there are companies out there developing alternatives and products that may help break that cycle , they still have a way to go .\nToday , your best bet is to look to the small , local farmers to get your food .\nYou have a better

last month in the journal Alzheimer \u2019 s and dementia , involved the postmortem examination of 404 elderly patients from the Memory and Aging Project at Rush University in Chicago .\nThe project

million COVID-19 deaths ( about 925,000 coming from the United States ) as of February 4 , 2022 .\nThe question that critical thinkers have asked throughout the pandemic \u2013 and one that public health officials have only recently acknowledged \u2013 is this : how many of these unfortunate cases reflect death from COVID versus death with COVID ?\nThe reason this is such an important question is that the way in which public health officials have chosen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for harmful lockdowns and near-perpetual states of emergency in places like California .\nAnd assuming there is a direct

is proof that global COVID death numbers are \u201c vastly overcounted \u201d In a lengthy and thoughtful analysis recently released on his website , osteopathic physician Dr. Joseph Mercola explores several concerning items of evidence suggesting that media reports from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true number of deaths caused by COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic .\nIn the United Kingdom , for instance , a total of 17,371 deaths between January 2020 and September 2021 had COVID-19 listed as the sole cause of death \u2013 significantly lower than the 137,133 \u201c COVID deaths \u201d originally

NaturalHealth365 ) On February 16th , 2022 , we published an article titled \u201c Criminal investigation underway for COVID-19 crimes against humanity , \u201d in which we informed our readers about the currently ongoing Grand Jury Investigation .\nIf you recall , this unprecedented proceeding is taking place outside the corrupt judiciary system , before the Court of Public Opinion .\nOn February 19th , 2022 , scientists , doctors , and other experts testified during the 4th session of the Grand Jury Investigation to shed light on the dangers of COVID-19 injections and the psychological warfare used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the almost 6-hour session , expert witnesses presented compelling and undeniable evidence that \u2013 without the shadow of a doubt \u2013 proved the massive fraud surrounding the COVID-19 shots .\nLevel 1 evidence of harm from Pfizer \u2019 s trial data proves governments knew or should have known that COVID-19 shots would cause harm to citizens Since day one of the injection rollout , we have heard thousands of times that the COVID-19 jab was safe and effective .\nHowever , the evidence to support this alleged safety and efficacy has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities .\nNot only that a scientific debate was not encouraged , but anyone speaking contrary to the official narrative was labeled as a conspiracy theorist , defamed , censored , banned , or worse .\nFor those with faith in government institutions and big pharma companies , learning about the evidence presented by expert witnesses may be extremely difficult .\nFinding out that Pfizer \u2013 and government agencies overseeing their trials \u2013 failed to follow established safety and efficacy protocols can be hard to conceive .\nIn addition , it is downright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at no risk of severe disease from COVID-19 \u2013 were harmed by the injections even during the clinical trials .\nBut what some would call even more disturbing is that governments not only authorized the use of the experimental injections without ensuring it was safe but coerced and forced their citizens to get the toxic substance injected into their bodies .\nWatch the testimonies here to see the evidence presented by the experts .\nCOVID-19 injections are \u201c toxic by design , \u201d former Pfizer scientist claims At the Grand Jury session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Mike Yeadon , former Chief Scientist and Vice President of Pulmonary Research at Pfizer with 32 years of experience in the biopharmaceutical industry .\nIn his testimony , he made many powerful fact-based statements that everyone should hear to understand the extent of the crime perpetrated on humanity .\nAccording to Dr. Yeadon , drug companies are fully aware that \u201c it is never appropriate to seek to invent , develop , manufacture and distribute a novel vaccine for a respiratory pathogen of such modest lethality.\n\u201d The reason is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure that the product is safe would be much longer than \u201c any plausible expectation of the length of time that the pandemic would be around.\n\u201d Nevertheless , companies went ahead and made these \u201c gene-based products.\n\u201d So the question we should all ask is , what was the intention ?\nDr. Yeadon believes that the COVID-19 injections are toxic by design .\nIn his opinion , drug companies knew that the spike proteins were toxic , genetically unstable , and similar to human proteins , all of which could lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this all about ?\nIs it about money or control ?\nOr is it about establishing in the public \u2019

worldwide with a product many scientists , researchers , and doctors refer to as poison .\nRegardless , the strategy to scare the population into blindly accepting the false narrative that the only way to \u201c get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire global population worked like a charm .\nCould all this be a giant mistake ?\nNot a chance , scientist claims How likely is it for four different pharma companies to make the same set of mistakes ?\nNot likely , or perhaps even impossible .\nAs Dr. Yeadon points out , it is close to a mathematical impossibility for all four leading COVID-jab manufacturers \u2013 Pfizer/BioNTech , Moderna , Astra Zeneca , Johnson and Johnson \u2013 to come up with such similar , poorly designed products .\nHe believes pharma companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring these products to market , and therefore , none of this is by mistake .\nThe final session of the Grand Jury proceedings took place on February 26th , 2022 .\nYou can watch the recording of the

the bones that increases susceptibility to fractures , can have devastating consequences .\nThe National Institutes of Health reports that a shocking 50 percent of women over age 60 ( along with 20 percent of men in that age group ) will suffer a potentially debilitating osteoporosis-related fracture at some point .\nAnd , with the \u201c graying \u201d of America , rates of the disease ( which disproportionately affects women ) are rising .\nExperts predict that the national prevalence of osteoporosis among women aged 50 and older will reach 13.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistics , a review of studies published this month in the journal Advances in Nutrition delivers particularly welcome news .\nThe authors , a team of scientists at Penn State University , concluded that a natural dietary intervention \u2013 daily consumption of ordinary prunes- may help delay and even prevent the onset of osteoporosis .\nSo let \u2019 s take a closer look at the review \u2013 and the bone-building benefits of prunes .\nResearchers : \u201c Promising effects \u201d on bone mineral density are one of the many benefits of prunes Researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving animals and 12 involving humans to conduct the review .\nThey identified multiple studies that showed that eating 100 grams of prunes ( about three ounces , or ten prunes ) every day for a year increased the mineral density of bones in the forearms and lower spines of postmenopausal women .\nAnd eating between 50 and 100 grams of prunes a day for six months was also shown to decrease a marker of resorption ( bone loss ) known as TRAP-5b .\nDr. Connie Rogers , an associate professor of nutritional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted that the prunes helped to inhibit inflammation and suppress markers of oxidative stress .\n( Oxidative stress and inflammation , triggered by the loss of estrogen in postmenopausal women , are believed to lie at the root of osteoporosis ) .\nThe researchers concluded that incorporating prunes into the diet could help strengthen bones .\nIt turns out that the benefits of prunes for bone health are multi-faceted .\nFor one thing , prunes contain antioxidants , such as anthocyanins , that help battle oxidative stress .\n( In fact , scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically prunes before they have been dried \u2013 contain roughly twice as many antioxidants as peaches and nectarines .\nAnd the drying process causes no loss of antioxidants ) .\nPrunes also contribute bone-building minerals , along with hefty amounts of vitamin K. Vitamin K , once known primarily for its importance to normal blood clotting , has created a \u201c buzz \u201d in recent research with its ability to escort calcium from the blood and into the bones , where it belongs .\nThe Penn State team also reported that prunes caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community of bacteria in the intestinal tract ) , which helped lower pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the colon .\nFinally , prunes decreased levels of malondialdehyde \u2013 a marker of oxidative stress \u2013 while increasing the expression of important antioxidants such as glutathione and superoxide dismutase .\nAdditional studies strongly support benefits of this dried fruit for bone health In older \u2013 but still-reputable \u2013 research published in 2009 in Aging Research Review , researchers credited prunes with being the \u201c most effective \u201d fruit in both preventing and reversing bone loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that prunes could restore bone mineral density to normal levels in rats with osteoporosis , reversing bone loss about as effectively as hormone therapy In a three-month clinical trial opostmenopausalal women conducted by the same research team , prunes significantly increased markers of bone formation , such as bone-specific alkaline phosphatase .\nPrunes are a nutritional jackpot of phytonutrients , vitamins , minerals , and fiber Prunes , botanically known as Prunus domestica , are a rich source of high-quality nutrients .\nA one-ounce serving contains a fifth of the adult recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with various B vitamins , which are needed to convert food to energy and a healthy nervous sys em .\nAnd prunes offer an array of bone-building minerals \u2013 including magnesium , potassium , and phosp orus .\nThe serving also contains 2 grams of heart-healthy dietary fiber .\nYet the caloric cost is a reasonable 67 calories ( meaning that even a three-ounce serving , like the one used in studies , clocks in at about 200 calories \u2013 less than that of a typical can y bar ) .\nAnd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they not only don \u2019 t raise blood sugar but may help regulate levels .\n( Researchers chalk this up to prunes \u2019 content of dietary fiber and adiponectin , a blood sugar-regulating hormone ) .\nPortable , convenient and tasty , prunes are easy to incorporate into the diet .\nHowever , to avoid diarrhea , some natural health experts advise keeping their consumption to half a cup a day and limiting prune juice to no more than 8 ounces a day .\nWhile many people are familiar with their stimulating effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use as a trusted dietary intervention for constipation \u2013 it \u2019 s likely that far fewer realize just how much these nutritious dried fruits can bolster and protect the strength and

of the virus .\nNone of the vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. contain a live virus.\n\u201d What do you think : Is the CDC unwilling or perhaps unable ( legally speaking ) to definitively state that mRNA COVID shots do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ webpage ?\nIf the CDC is confident that the COVID shots do not shed , why not simply say , \u201c mRNA COVID vaccines do not shed \u201d ?\nAs a \u201c side note : \u201d On the same webpage , the CDC also makes this very carefully crafted claim : \u201c no evidence shows that any vaccines , including COVID-19 vaccines , cause fertility problems.\n\u201d You will notice that this is not the same thing as saying \u201c evidence shows that vaccines do not cause fertility problems.\n\u201d Simply put , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter because it doesn \u2019 t have enough proof to support the latter .\nRead section 13.1 of almost any vax insert .\nIt will almost certainly say that the vax \u201c has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or impairment of fertility.\n\u201d Well then , of course , there \u2019 s \u201c no evidence \u201d showing that vaccines cause fertility problems \u2013 no such evidence has ever been adequately investigated !\nAnd as the old saying goes , absence of evidence does not mean evidence of absence .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research needs to be corroborated by other research .\nIf there is any amount of truth to his claims , other scientists should be able to reproduce his findings .\nBut in case you were wondering , several other viral jabs can and do shed , including MMR ( measles , mumps , rubella ) , chickenpox , flu ( intranasal only ) , shingles , rotavirus , and polio ( the oral version of the vaccine only , which is not used anymore in the US ) .\nConsider being mindful about @ @ @ @ @ @ @

accent and finish off the appearance of a well-prepared platter of food , many cooks add a sprig of parsley \u2013 then call it a day .\nAfter all , the final result looks attractive .\nAnd , if someone was to decide to nibble a bit on this edible greenery , there would be no harm done .\nSo , using a little fresh parsley as a garnish is a win/win .\nRight ?\nWrong .\nAs it turns out , research highlights the health-sustaining nutrients and valuable antioxidants in parsley \u2014 which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than as mere decoration .\nTo learn about parsley \u2019 s surprising ( and protective ) health benefits , read on .\nParsley is extraordinarily high in a flavonoid known as myricetin .\nAccording to a 2020 study published in Archives of Toxicology , myricetin can block the carcinogenic effects of heterocyclic amines ( HCAs ) in beef , poultry , and fish .\nThese potentially cancer-causing compounds \u2013 which result from the reaction of creatine , amino acids , and sugar \u2013 occur in meats that have been cooked at high temperatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature and the longer the cooking time , the more HCAs are created .\nSo , if your taste runs towards charred steaks and blackened chicken or fish ( which we don \u2019 t encourage you to eat ) , researchers suggest pairing the food with a healthy serving size of parsley .\nAnd myricetin is not the only anticancer compound found in it .\nIn a recent review in Frontiers in Pharmacology , the authors noted that apigenin , an antioxidant in this herb , has been shown in studies to decrease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast cancer .\nApigenin is currently being investigated as a cancer treatment , although therapeutic amounts would likely far exceed those found in a serving of parsley .\nStill , it \u2019 s probably not a bad idea to invite parsley to your next meal !\nOver 37 million people \u2013 more than 10 percent of the United States population \u2013 are currently affected by diabetes .\nScientists report that myricetin and apigenin from parsley may potentially help maintain healthy blood sugar levels , as well .\nWhile more human studies are needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can keep blood sugar levels in a healthy range , remove fats from the blood and decrease insulin resistance \u2013 all helpful in addressing type 2 diabetes .\nIn addition , both myricetin and apigenin have anti-inflammatory effects , thereby helping to calm down the inflammation that lies at the heart of many chronic degenerative diseases .\nParsley is extremely rich in vitamin K , with a mere ten sprigs of the herb providing the recommended dietary allowance for an entire day .\nWhile researchers formerly believed that the main function of vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood clotting , scientists now credit this fat-soluble nutrient with improving calcium absorption while reducing calcium excretion in urine .\nThis makes vitamin K uniquely important for bone health .\nIn fact , studies have shown that people with the highest levels of vitamin K are more likely to maintain strong bones .\n( Note : if you are taking blood thinners , discuss parsley consumption with your trusted integrative physician ) .\nAdd flavor , texture , and antioxidants to foods with fresh parsley The tangy , refreshing flavor of fresh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for accenting potatoes , soups , stews , salad dressings , omelets , and casseroles .\nOr , use parsley as you would basil or oregano to enliven your favorite sauce .\nYou can also create a flavorful mixed green salad by combining fresh parsley with romaine

and curly varieties .\nBoth are equally beneficial , so which one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preference .\nKeep in mind , while the benefits of this herb are extensive , natural health experts do advise against eating it in large quantities .\nRegularly consuming entire bowls of it could potentially lead to ill effects such as anemia .\nBy the way , natural healers have long believed that parsley , in reasonable amounts , can promote bladder , kidney , digestive , and liver health .\nOther benefits include the fact that it is rich in vitamin C , packed with vitamin A and high in dietary fiber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a natural breath freshener .\nThe takeaway : parsley is a wholesome food that should not be confined to the category of \u201c garnish.\n\u201d Add this herb to your healthy diet \u2013 and

stunning one in three adults .\nAlthough many cases of NAFLD are mild , the disease can occasionally progress to severe and even life-threatening consequences , including liver cancer .\nNow ,

@ @ @ @ @ @ To learn more about the effects of this surprising natural strategy on NAFLD , read on .\nSkyrocketing rates of obesity are triggering a national epidemic of NAFLD The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) reports that a shocking 66 percent of American adults are currently either overweight or obese , which goes a long way towards explaining the increasing rates of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease .\nAs the name implies , the primary cause is not excessive alcohol \u2013 but consumption of too many toxic foods and a lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of high fructose corn syrup plus many other processed foods lead to fat deposits in the liver , which over time causes dysfunction of the mitochondria in liver cells .\nExperts estimate that in 20 to 30 percent of the cases , NAFLD progresses to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( or NASH ) , a more serious condition that can sometimes lead to liver fibrosis ( scarring ) , cirrhosis of the liver , liver failure , liver cancer and death .\nAccording to a new study conducted by scientists at Helmholtz Munich and Tubingen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mitochondria in the liver that can prevent the development of fatty liver disease .\nOver the course of the six-week study , mice were fed a high-calorie diet \u2013 and some received \u201c treadmill training , \u201d meaning that they had regular exercise .\nThe team found that regular physical activity regulates the breakdown of glucose in the liver and improves the function of the mitochondria , also known as the \u201c power stations \u201d of the cell .\nThe \u201c exercised \u201d mice also displayed improvements in glucose control .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respiratory capacity of the muscles , thereby relieving stress on the liver .\nAlthough the study was conducted on animals , it mirrors the research results on humans .\n\u201c The results fit in very well with the approaches of ongoing clinical studies , \u201d reported study leader Dr. Cora Weigert .\nAdditional studies support the ability of regular exercise to improve liver health In a review published in 2018 in Gene Expression , the Journal of Liver Research , the authors summarized the evidence for the effects of regular physical exercise on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several clinical trials have shown that both aerobic and resistance exercise reduce liver fat by several different pathways .\nThese include improving insulin resistance \u2013 which reduces the excess delivery of fats and glucose to the liver \u2013 increasing fatty acid oxidation ( in other words , fat burning ) decreasing fatty acid synthesis and preventing mitochondrial and liver damage .\nIn light of all this , it \u2019 s not at all surprising that the American Gastroenterological Association , the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NAFLD !\nWhat type of exercise is best for NAFLD ?\nStudies suggest that a wide variety of exercise styles , intensities and duration can benefit NAFLD .\nThe authors of the 2018 review cited a study of overweight and obese NAFLD patients that evaluated the effects of three different exercise regimes : low intensity/high volume , high-intensity/low volume and low intensity/low volume .\nEach was found to cause significant reductions in liver fat .\nIn another study , NASH patients performed a moderate exercise program consisting of 20- to 60-minute sessions four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program , which included both resistance and aerobic training , caused a significant improvement in NASH .\nResistance training includes weight lifting , squats , lunges , and pushups .\nYou can get aerobic exercise through jogging , cycling , dancing , swimming , and even brisk walking .\nHowever , researchers in several studies stressed that the most important factor was that the exercise routine fit the individual \u2019 s ability and preferences .\nBy the way , the general recommendation of the National Institutes of Health is for adults to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week .\nBut , do check first with your integrative doctor before embarking on an exercise regimen to address NAFLD .\nWhile there is currently no consensus on which type of exercise is \u201c best \u201d for NAFLD , almost any kind of regular physical activity can be beneficial .\nBy showing exactly how regular exercise positively impacts

phase one of this global experiment , people were conditioned to accept the idea that to keep others safe , they must give up their fundamental liberties , personal freedoms , and right to bodily autonomy .\nThe experiment was quite successful as the vast majority acquiesced and went along with tyranny , complying with unscientific COVID-19 mitigation measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the World Health Organization ( WHO ) declared COVID-19 a pandemic , countries implemented almost the exact same measures , following the same playbook \u2013 locking down citizens , destroying economies , and

moving us into their Great Reset On February 18 , 2022 , Dr. Peter Breggin , author of the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We Are the Prey , \u201d published an article that warned humanity about the globalists \u2019 next move , the takeover of the entire world \u2019 s healthcare systems .\nThe egregious COVID jab passports pushed in most countries are the first step towards seizing total control .\nTheir

the WHO will have the power to implement mandatory jabs or health passports for billions of people worldwide .\nIf you think this would be impossible to carry out , think again .\nThe plan is clearly

, the researchers called for more studies to identify and explore contributory factors among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increased risk .\nIngredients in ultra-processed foods disturb the balance of the all-important gut microbiome The researchers commented that IBD is believed to stem from dysbiosis ( imbalances in the microbiome , or community of gut bacteria ) in susceptible people .\nStudies have

it is too early to say for sure , scientists suspect certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stabilizers , preservatives , and artificial flavors \u2013 of being the culprits .\nFor example , an emulsifier known as carboxymethylcellulose has been shown to increase the ability of bacteria to adhere to the epithelial lining of the intestines .\nOther suspects are refined sugars and potentially inflammatory omega-6

who present with symptoms such as fever , cough , shortness of breath , chills , muscle pain , sore throat , loss of taste/smell , diarrhea , or vomiting , but have a negative PCR test .\n\u201c So ,

your cardiovascular system in the first place .\nIt was once a common school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ olive oil consumption came about because of the oil \u2019 s high monosaturated fatty acid , especially oleic

olives superior in polyphenol content .\nWhen olive oil is further refined , many polyphenols are lost .\nIt \u2019 s not unusual to find the polyphenol content plummeting from as much as 350 mg/kg found in extra virgin olive oil to as little as just 2.7 mg/kg in oil that has been further refined .\nIn addition to choosing extra virgin varieties , buy only high-quality brands .\nIf you do not have the luxury of living near an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil from a market that enables you to taste before buying , choose a vendor known to perform very stringent quality control .\nAnd remember , unlike a fine wine , olive oil does not get better with age .\nOnce you have selected an oil , try to use it in low-heat cooking or raw on salads daily .\nIn nearly all studies showing the benefits of olive

idea of a great conversation starter , the fact is : that roughly 16 to 20 percent of all American adults suffer from occasional constipation .\nAnd , the odds of staying \u201c regular \u201d don \u2019 t improve with age .\nAccording to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases , the incidence of constipation rises to 33 percent for those over 60 \u2013 meaning that

therapeutic improvements of a mere 10 to 15 percent over placebo \u2013 a frankly underwhelming result .\nHowever , experts say that inadequate dietary fiber intake is a primary culprit in triggering constipation ( which is good news , because relief could be as close as your kitchen cabinet or crisper drawer ) .\nLet \u2019 s check out three fiber-rich foods that can relieve constipation and promote regularity and digestive health .\nIt \u2019 s no accident that apples top the list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOne medium apple contains almost five grams of fiber \u2013 close to a fifth of the recommended daily intake for adults .\nIn addition , apples contain not one , but two types of beneficial dietary fiber \u2013 insoluble fiber , which adds much-needed bulk to bowel movements \u2013 and soluble fiber , which softens stools .\nStudies have shown that pectin , the soluble fiber in apples , is fermented in the digestive tract , producing short-chain fatty acids ( SCFAs ) .\nThese

all apples . )\nFor maximum benefit , put away the peeler and crunch your apples \u201c skins and all.\n\u201d At least half of the fiber in an apple is contained in the peel .\nWith one kiwi containing a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succulent fruit may not be as fiber-rich as the apple .\nBut kiwis have a secret weapon against constipation \u2013 an enzyme known as actinidin , which aids the digestion of protein and helps \u201c speed up traffic \u201d in the gastrointestinal tract .\nIn a 2018 study published in the European Journal of Nutrition , researchers found that eating two peeled

quarter of the RDI for adults .\nLike apples , pears contain pectin .\nIn addition , they are high in fructose and sorbitol , a pair of natural sugars that act as laxatives by drawing water into the

.\nPleasant-tasting , nutritious , and highly digestible pears are a very palatable way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the digestive tract .\nA variety of natural techniques may help relieve constipation ( which is generally defined as having bowel movements less than three times per week , straining while trying to \u201c go , \u201d and/or having stools that are lumpy or hard ) .\nProbiotic foods \u2013 such

waste products .\nIn addition , efficient circulation facilitates better coronary health , quicker healing of wounds , sharper mental function , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , natural nutrients and supplements can go a long way toward keeping veins and arteries healthy and functional .\nFor example , recent research supports the ability of grape seed extract to significantly boost blood flow efficiency

letter from the FDA to Pfizer regarding the approval of its mRNA shot , the FDA writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] has the same formulation as the EUA-authorized vaccine , and the products can be used interchangeably to provide the vaccination series without presenting any safety or effectiveness concerns .\nThe products are legally distinct with certain differences that do not impact safety or

healthcare providers or institutions who issue or mandate the unapproved EUA-version of the drug , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sued for damages caused by it .\nHowever , the fully approved version of the shot ( the gray cap COMIRNATY label ) does not reportedly come with liability protection , which allegedly puts Pharma , the military , and other mandating agencies at risk of litigation should someone become injured by the drug and decide to sue .\nCritics also argue that the legal distinction also means that the US government or any other agency or institution can not legally mandate an unauthorized drug \u2026 which hardly explains why so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials say they \u2019 re protected against litigation even with fully approved version of their shot This legal distinction between the EUA and FDA-approved versions of the Pfizer mRNA jab has been swiftly fact-checked by mainstream media .\nIn an email to the Washington Post , Pfizer spokesperson Sharon J. Castillo writes that the \u201c legally distinct with certain differences \u201d refers to the differences in manufacturing information included in the respective regulatory submissions \u201d and has nothing to do with liability protection .\nShe continues , \u201c The liability protections afforded under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act ( PREP Act ) ] are tied to the declared public health emergency and not whether the vaccine is sold under an EUA \u2026 Therefore , both Comirnaty and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine receive the same liability protections as medical countermeasures against COVID-19.\n\u201d In other words , people apparently can not sue for damages from either the COMIRNATY shot or the EUA shot ( but can apply for compensation through a taxpayer-funded program with a poor history of actual payouts for vax victims and their families ) .\nSetting aside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s still an unclear issue : Why would the US Military urge military treatment facilities to order the approved version of the shot only if \u201c needed due to legal reasons ( i.e.\n, mandated ) \u201d ?\nDoes this mean that anyone who has forced employees to get the EUA-version of the drug

complicates the narrative for pro-vaxxers , as it suggests that people who have received these mRNA injections may be more likely to experience a SARS-CoV-2 infection and suffer .\nNEJM study suggests that COVID jabs may increase risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection , at least at certain point in time post-doses The study , \u201c Effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Infections , \u201d analyzed data from 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 ( allegedly Omicron subvariants ) infected individuals and non-infected individuals from the Middle Eastern country Qatar between December 23 , 2021 , and February 21 , 2022 .\nThe study \u2019 s objective was to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the mRNA COVID jabs ( BNT162b2 from Pfizer-BioNTech and mRNA-1273 from Moderna ) vs. natural immunity vs previous infection plus vaccination against symptomatic and/or severe COVID-19 disease .\nNatural immunity works ( and , we can surmise , certainly shouldn \u2019 t be banned as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c Previous infection

NaturalHealth365 ) Are \u201c fast foods \u201d really a \u201c fast track \u201d to depression ?\nFor too many Americans , sipping sugary coffee for breakfast , downing a high-salt , fat-laden fast-food meal for lunch , and topping it all off with hours of sitting at a desk is \u201c standard operating procedure.\n\u201d Now , scientists say that this unhealthy diet can be a recipe for mental distress \u2013 not to mention a heightened risk of heart disease , type 2 diabetes , and obesity .\nThe National Institute of Mental Health reports that an estimated 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one bout with depression in 2020 .\nWhile the causes of depression are complex , recent research showcases the link between dietary habits and mental health .\nIn a 2019 study , researchers at the Binghamton University of New York concluded that a healthier , high-quality diet could reduce symptoms of depression .\nNow , in a fascinating twist , a new study by the same team shows that this outcome applies more to one sex than the other \u2013 especially for people over 30 .\nLet \u2019 s take a closer look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nStudy shows that mature women display greater improvements in depression with healthier diet In a new randomized controlled study published last month in the Journal of Personalized Medicine , the investigators found that the connection between diet and depression is stronger in women than in men \u2013 particularly for adults over 30 .\nIn other words , mature women suffered more mental distress than mature men due to unhealthy eating habits \u2013 particularly when these habits included a high intake of processed fast foods .\nWomen also displayed greater improvements in depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dark leafy greens , legumes , and fish .\nWhile women appeared to be more sensitive to the impact of an unhealthy diet , men were by no means immune .\nAs with women , high consumption of fast food , coupled with a sedentary lifestyle , was linked with mental distress .\nBut that wasn \u2019 t all .\nThe study proved that regular exercise , when added to dietary improvements , can also help \u201c flip the script \u201d \u2013 easing depression and promoting a more positive outlook .\nExercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor diet Study leader Lina Begdache , an assistant professor of Health and Wellness Studies at the University of Binghamton , noted that making unwise dietary choices took a particular toll on mature women .\nRegarding causing mental distress in this group , fast food , caffeine , high-glycemic foods , and skipping breakfast entirely topped the list of culprits .\nThe good news is that exercise can help ease the negative \u201c mental fallout \u201d from these choices , with the team reporting that at least 20 minutes of exercise per day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so helpful ?\nFor one thing , physical activity supports the release of growth and neurotrophic factors associated with neuroplasticity , which simply means that exercise helps to improve cognitive function and mental well-being .\nOther gifts conferred by exercise include improved circulation , reduced stress , and increased release of \u201c feel-good \u201d chemical messengers in

significantly fewer depressive symptoms \u2013 and enjoyed substantial improvements in mood \u2013 after eating a healthy diet for a mere three weeks .\nThe participants , all university students with moderate-to-high depression symptoms , normally consumed diets high in processed foods , sugar , and saturated fats .\nHowever , making healthy changes in diet , such as eating more fruit , vegetables , fish , and olive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many participants shifted into the \u201c normal \u201d range .\nLook to high-quality protein , complex carbs , amino acids , and healthy fats to lift mood The team classified complex carbohydrates , amino acids , protein , and healthy fats , such as omega-3s , as \u201c healthy food groups.\n\u201d Specifically , the scientists identified fruits , whole grains , fish , and dark green leafy vegetables \u2013 such as spinach and kale \u2013 as foods that cause increased well-being .\n( For men , nuts , and fish , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d results .\nRegular exercise caused the improvement to be even more pronounced ) .\nThe issue of drinking caffeinated coffee was complex \u2013 and something of a question mark .\nThe researchers noted that women who consumed high levels of caffeine and did not exercise had more mental distress .\nHowever , women who drank coffee and exercised reported working out longer .\nFor many , the connection between large amounts of heavily-processed fast food and increasing mental distress has always been obvious .\nBut , it is truly revealing to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so clearly documented .\nSo , here \u2019 s to better

to write up a report to VAERS for every adverse reaction they see post-jab ) .\nAnd even with the high possibility of underreporting , there has still been a significant increase in the number of

unending COVID shot boosters ?\nOn June 29 , 2022 , President Biden \u2019 s Administration announced a $ 3.2 billion deal to \u201c secure 105 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine for [ a ] fall vaccination campaign.\n\u201d The deal came with an option to buy up to 300 million doses .\nThe very next day after this deal was made , the FDA came out and said that these fall booster shots would need to be modified to target specific variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus , Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 .\nSo , in addition to using taxpayer money to purchase billions of dollars worth of shots from these companies , the government is now telling these companies to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinforcing that whatever COVID shots people already got earlier in the pandemic are useless and likely won \u2019 t \u201c count \u201d toward future vax mandates .\nIs this what we can expect to see every fall from now on , just like flu shots ?\nDr. David Gortler is a pharmacologist and FDA reform advocate at the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington , D.C .\nIn an email to Children \u2019 s Health Defense , he writes , \u201c Nobody is taking the booster shots , and the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Pfizer , \u201d adding that \u201c Pfizer is on track to make $ 50 billion off vaccines in 2022 alone and the government keeps on ordering.\n\u201d Notably , no human clinical trials to date have tested modified COVID shots with Omicron subvariants , according to Children \u2019 s Health Defense ( although Pfizer and Moderna will reportedly begin such trials shortly ) .\nIn a Twitter post , Children \u2019 s Health Defense founder Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. stated that the White House \u201c has dropped all pretenses that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling the move an \u201c unsheathed corporate welfare project to further enrich the shareholders of the most profitable industry in history.\n\u201d Pay attention : You can never be \u201c fully vaxxed \u201d against COVID-19 You \u2019 ll remember at the beginning of the vax rollout how people would brag about being \u201c fully vaxxed \u201d and how government officials would say that \u201c fully vaxxed \u201d individuals were doing their part to protect themselves and each other \u2026 notice how quickly this argument fell apart , for a few reasons .\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these COVID shots do NOT stop transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and that vaxxed individuals infected with the virus are as infectious as vax-free individuals who are infected ( and building natural immunity ) .\nThe idea that getting jabbed will prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is simply not grounded in reality .\nFor another thing , and according to the U.S. government , there is no such thing as \u201c fully vaxxed \u201d anymore .\nOn its website , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) does not refer to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people should \u201c stay up to date with the recommended vaccines.\n\u201d They use the term \u201c up to date \u201d to describe anyone who has received \u201c all doses [ of the COVID shots ] in the primary series and all boosters recommended for you , when eligible.\n\u201d This might seem like a subtle change in terminology , but the implication is significant : anyone who agrees to get a vax is effectively agreeing to get as many doses of it as deemed necessary by the government .\nThis also means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline any further shot , they too must suffer the consequences that the government has gotten away with , such as banning you from travel , access to public spaces , and even employment .\nHaving to perpetually consume drugs to participate in society is not ethical , yet many will argue that this is precisely the groundwork laid for the American public .\nGive the government an inch , and they will take miles .", "author":

story , study finds To understand the study findings , let \u2019 s review how protein works to build muscle .\nProtein is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since muscles require daily protein intake to rebuild themselves .\nGetting enough protein also helps increase your bone density .\nThis is because muscles are composed of myosin and actin protein filaments , which produce muscle contractions by interacting with each other .\nThese protein filaments would eventually become damaged from the constant stress of movement if they didn \u2019 t receive a daily supply of protein .\nMuscle protein turnover is a constant process involving the building and degrading muscle fibers .\nSo to build more muscle mass than it loses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein .\nBut that \u2019 s not all .\nIt also needs to be in an anabolic state .\nSo if you \u2019 re looking to increase your muscle mass and size , protein intake can help .\nHowever , there \u2019 s another critical piece to the puzzle .\nWhat \u2019 s the best way to maximize muscle-building ?\nThe recent study in the British Journal of Sports Medicine sought to prove whether protein supplementation boosts muscle mass and strength .\nThe researchers found that protein supplementation significantly increased muscle size and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training .\nAnd this makes sense since resistance is one of the most powerful ways to trigger an anabolic state , which is essential to building muscle .\nMuscle fibers become damaged when they undergo mechanical resistance , such as weightlifting .\nThis is a good thing , as your body responds by building more muscle .\nSo when you put your muscles under stress , it helps them get bigger and stronger \u2013 as long as you have enough protein intake .\nAnd augmenting your dietary intake with protein supplementation can improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to build muscle ?\nSo how much extra protein is necessary to build muscle mass when combined with exercise training ?\nExperts disagree , but the amount needed depends on factors like age , weight , and activity level .\nBut if you \u2019 re doing athletic training , a good guideline is about 1.2-1.4 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight .\nYou also need to make sure you \u2019 re getting high-quality protein .\nProtein is made up of twenty amino acids , nine of which your body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis means you need to consume them in your diet .\nAnimal proteins contain all nine , yet you can also get them from a carefully planned plant-based diet .\nSo if you \u2019 re looking to build muscle , it \u2019 s worth looking into protein supplementation to help you get results .\nBut remember , it will only make a difference when combined with resistance exercise .", "author": "News Staff", "url":

\u2019 s see why .\nTwo big problems with Pfizer \u2019 s money-making COVID shot that received full FDA approval for kids 12 to 15 years old There is no hiding at least two facts when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u2022 First , these shots are making some people very sick \u2013 from heart inflammation to paralysis to blood clots and an untold number of other health issues .\n\u2022 These shots are making some people very wealthy .\nAccording to various sources , Pfizer earned a whopping $ 37 billion in sales from its mRNA COVID shot in 2021 .\nLike Moderna , it is making about $ 65,000 per minute \u2013 that \u2019 s over $ 1,000 per second \u2013 with no small thanks to its heavily propagandized drug .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ with criminal activity , including bribing of doctors and unethical and dishonest

following emergency use authorization in May 2021.\n\u201d The move is certainly not without criticism .\nChildren \u2019 s Health Defense president Mary Holland was quoted as saying that the FDA \u201c failed to convene an expert committee and failed to appropriately weigh the risk-benefit profile of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vaccine cheerleader Dr. Paul Offit acknowledged FDA decisions are being made based on political pressure , not science when , in commenting on the agency \u2019 s vote last week to allow reformulated booster shots , he said it felt like \u2018 the fix was in.\n\u2019 \u201d Pfizer itself says that this decision was largely based on data showing that the COVID shots provoked a strong immune response and high antibody levels in adolescents \u201c one month after the second dose.\n\u201d Notice how easily Pfizer ( and the FDA ) ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly quickly not long after a month out in virtually all other age groups .\nThey also ignore the fact that just because a drug provokes a strong immune response does not necessarily mean there \u2019 s any clinical significance to such an observation \u2013 in other words , having high levels of antibodies doesn \u2019 t necessarily prove that a person is any more protected against COVID-19 than they would have been without the shot .\nEven members of the FDA \u2019 s Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee ( VRBPAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think that \u201c public health \u201d officials want to expose American adolescents to such uncertainties and grey areas ?\nPlenty of other glaring issues surrounding this new FDA approval of COVID-19 shots for kids and teens Aside from relying on questionable interpretations of clinical data , both Pfizer and FDA have made several other unusual moves in their quest to approve these shots for younger and younger kids .\nAmong these moves : \u2022 Pfizer cited old data on 16- to 25-year-olds ( pre-Delta and Omicron ) while arguing their case for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12- to 15-year-old age group \u2022 COMIRNATY is not yet available in the U.S. , Children \u2019 s Health Defense notes \u2013 any pharmacy , hospital , or clinic is still giving out the unapproved and \u201c legally distinct \u201d version of the shot , which is available under Emergency Authorization Use ( EUA ) only \u2022 The Pfizer COVID shot available under EUA does not even have the same clinical formula as its FDA-approved version \u2013 COMIRNATY contains a compound called tromethamine ( Tris ) buffer , which is considered a category @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies have been done to determine the safety of this new formula ( which will become relevant when and if COMIRNATY is actually made available ) .\nLike many , Holland believes this lightning-quick FDA approval \u201c is a move by Pharma to ensure liability protection.\n\u201d It \u2019 s a nod to the fact that Pfizer can \u2019 t be sued for damages caused by its COVID-19 shots if the shots become a part of the childhood vaccine schedule recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 .\nWe are reluctant to see how long it will take the FDA and its Big Pharma Buddies to fully approve these gene-based shots for kids under 12 .\nBut , at this point , it really just seems like a matter of time , regardless of what the safety

published in Nature Communications by Cao et al .\ndisproving the asymptomatic spread hysteria .\nWriting for The Brownstone Institute , author Jeffrey Tucker provides a detailed overview of Dr. Birx \u2019 s book .\nHe highlights several direct quotes from her book showcasing just how dishonest , fraudulent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look at some of her direct words : \u2022 Writing about how she figured out how to get lockdowns approved in the U.S. , despite the fact that these Draconian measures proved to be absolutely disastrous for citizens , and especially children : \u201c We had to make these palatable to the administration by avoiding the obvious appearance of a full Italian lockdown \u2026 At the same time , we needed the measures to be effective at slowing the spread , which meant matching as closely as possible what Italy had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing a game of chess in which the success of each move was predicated on the one before it.\n\u201d \u2022 How she got an inch and immediately wanted a mile when it came to lockdowns : \u201c No sooner had we convinced the Trump administration to implement our version of the two-week shutdown than I was trying to figure out how to extend it.\n\u201d \u2022 How she manipulated those around her to get what she \u201c wanted \u201d in terms of social distancing : \u201c I had settled on 10 [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was too many , but I figured that ten would at least be palatable for most Americans \u2013 high enough to allow for most gatherings of immediate family but not enough for large dinner parties and , critically , large weddings , birthday parties , and other mass social events.\n\u201d She adds , \u201c If I pushed for zero ( which was actually what I wanted and what was required ) , this would have been interpreted as a \u2018 lockdown \u2019 \u2013 the perception we were all working so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used \u201c strategic sleight-of-hand \u201d to manipulate data to continue pushing her pandemic control agenda , even when plenty of states were opening up again : \u201c I \u2019 d reinsert what [ the Trump Administration ] had objected to [ in the weekly COVID-19 reports ] , but place it in those different locations .\nI \u2019 d also reorder and restructure the bullet points so the most salient \u2013 the points the administration objected to most \u2013 no longer fell at the start of the bullet points .\nI shared these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data team also writing these reports .\nOur Saturday and Sunday report-writing routine soon became : write , submit , revise , hide , resubmit .\nFortunately , this strategic sleight-of-hand worked .\nThat they never seemed to catch this subterfuge left me to conclude that either they read the finished reports too quickly or they neglected to do the word search that would have revealed the language to which they objected .\nIn slipping these changes past the gatekeepers and continuing to inform the governors of the need for the big-three mitigations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits on indoor social gatherings \u2013 I felt confident I was giving the states permission to escalate public health mitigation with the fall and winter coming.\n\u201d If it didn \u2019 t reveal the ongoing manipulation she and her colleagues used to push their agendas ahead , Dr. Birx \u2019 s words would almost sound funny .\nYet far from grounding

Control and Prevention , over 19 million adults in the United States have been diagnosed with allergic rhinitis in the past year alone .\nAlso known as hay fever and seasonal allergies , allergic rhinitis causes a host of troublesome symptoms that can include congestion , sneezing , coughing , headache and itching , and watery eyes .\nWhile Western medicine attempts to treat hay fever with antihistamines , these drugs can cause unwanted side effects \u2013 including drowsiness , dizziness , and rapid heart rate .\nA recent University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this flavonoid , which is found in fruits and vegetables , can safely support lung function .\nOther research has showcased its allergy-easing effects .\nLet \u2019 s look at some of the most compelling benefits of quercetin .\nThe health-promoting benefits of flavonoids such as quercetin have long been known to scientists .\nTwo decades ago , in groundbreaking research published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , researchers identified flavonoids as effective antioxidants that could protect against chronic illnesses .\nIn animal , cell , and clinical studies , quercetin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scavenge harmful free radicals , thereby reducing disease-causing oxidative damage .\nIn addition , one study showed that quercetin supplementation decreased markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in patients with a chronic lung disease known as pulmonary sarcoidosis .\nIn a 2020 clinical trial published in BMJ Open Respiratory Research , scientists evaluated the effects of supplementary quercetin on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , a blanket term for a group of diseases that cause breathing problems .\nParticipants with COPD were given supplementary quercetin for a week \u2013 with researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reducing oxidative stress and lung inflammation .\nOne of the primary goals of the study was to evaluate the safety of quercetin \u2013 and there was great news in that department .\nThe team reported that the treatment was well-tolerated , with participants reporting no serious adverse events .\nOf course , it \u2019 s not only individuals with COPD that can benefit from quercetin .\nThis non-toxic natural compound is proving its merits as a natural intervention to ease allergy discomfort .\nOne of quercetin \u2019 s \u201c superpowers \u201d is its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ histamine in the body .\nIn other words , quercetin can function as a natural antihistamine .\nAccording to family medicine physician Jaclyn Tolentino , D.O.\n, quercetin may help to reduce allergy symptoms such as runny nose , watery eyes , and swelling of the face and lips \u2013 minus the drying or sedating effects associated with pharmaceutical antihistamines .\nIn addition , quercetin-rich diets are associated with a lower incidence of asthma , which currently affects 8.4 percent of American adults .\nIn a review involving over 10,000 participants published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the investigators found that the risk of asthma was reduced by an eye-opening 24 percent with a high-quercetin diet .\n( The scientists also found health-sustaining benefits for the flavonoids naringenin , hesperidin , and kaempferol .\nThis trio of antioxidant compounds tends to be found alongside quercetin in fruits and vegetables , so eating these healthy foods is a win/win for your health . )\nIncidentally , in a separate study , 12 weeks of quercetin supplementation reduced the risk of upper respiratory infections in healthy adults .\n( Not only does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases , but it appears to help healthy people stay that way ! )\nPopulation studies show that people who eat diets high in flavonoids \u2013 such as quercetin , resveratrol , and catechin \u2013 have healthier levels of cholesterol .\nAnd preliminary studies have suggested that quercetin may reduce blood pressure and blood sugar in obese and overweight participants .\nQuercetin has also been found to improve cardiovascular health by inhibiting platelet aggregation \u2013 the tendency of blood to form dangerous clots .\nSo , it \u2019 s really not surprising that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quercetin also showed that high-quercetin diets decreased the risk of death from ischemic heart disease .\nClearly , supporting heart health is among the many benefits of quercetin .\nGood dietary sources of quercetin include black and green tea , berries , cherries , tomatoes , onions , leafy green vegetables , cruciferous vegetables , peppers , beans , and apples .\n( Pro tip : Red apples are a better source than green apples , so \u2013 when it comes to quercetin content \u2013 a Red Delicious decisively beats a Granny Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of peeling that apple .\nMost of its quercetin is found in the skin ) .\nWhen it comes to quercetin content , organic produce is the way to go .\nA recent study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry showed that organic tomatoes contained a stunning 79 percent more than those that were conventionally grown .\nQuercetin is available in supplementary form , sometimes packaged with bromelain ( an anti-inflammatory enzyme found in pineapples ) and vitamin C to increase bioavailability .\nNatural healers typically recommend quercetin amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day \u2013 but check first with your integrative doctor before supplementing .\nAs a growing body of research shows , quercetin is emerging as a potent natural antioxidant that can support respiratory function and help to combat allergies .\nIt \u2019 s just one more evidence-based

\u2013 after having been in effect since January 2020 \u2013 we are no doubt facing yet another season of highly propagandized messages to get vaxxed , get \u201c boosted , \u201d and stay \u201c up-to-date \u201d on all our COVID shots .\nBut new research published in the New England Journal of Medicine appears to add yet another checkmark in the \u201c Reasons to Question the Shot \u201d column .\nPeople are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this new study may turn them away even more It \u2019 s clear that plenty of people in this country are already disinterested in the so-called COVID boosters .\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , of the 222.7 million Americans who are considered \u201c fully vaxxed , \u201d fewer than half of them ( 107 million ) have received a single booster \u2013 and even fewer of them have received a second booster .\n( For that matter , and despite mainstream media \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who have chosen not to get jabbed are just a \u201c selfish \u201d fringe minority , CDC stats reveal that nearly a third of eligible U.S. citizens remain completely COVID shot-free ! )\nBut the new NEJM research , called \u201c Duration of Shedding of Culturable Virus in SARS-CoV-2 Omicron ( BA.1 ) Infection , \u201d contains evidence that suggests getting booster shots may actually prolong the amount of time a person is infectious should they end up getting COVID-19 anyway ( which is no longer considered \u201c rare \u201d given that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop transmission , according to CDC director Rochelle Walensky ) .\nFor the study , the team of researchers from Mass General Brigham analyzed repeated nasal swab samples from 66 patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 , 32 of whom were found to be infected with the B.1.617.2 ( delta ) variant ( following genetic sequencing of the samples ) , and 34 of whom were found to be infected with the omicron subvariant BA.1 .\nThe characteristics of the patients in the two variant groups were similar \u201c except that more participants with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than had those with delta infection ( 35 % vs. 3 % ) , \u201d the authors say ( quite a big difference ) .\nAfter analyzing the swab samples \u2019 viral load over time and culturing these samples in a lab , the researchers discovered that triple-vaxxed individuals remained contagious for a more extended period of time following a COVID infection than people who were unvaxxed .\nIsrael National News interpreted some of the data as follows : Only around 25 percent of unvaxxed people were still contagious ( as indicated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultured samples ) at 5 days following their first positive PCR test , whereas closer to 70 percent of vaxxed and boosted people were still contagious at this time .\nThe difference was even greater once people reached 10 days out , with a difference ranging from 6 percent to 31 percent , respectively .\nAre researchers denying what their data is telling them about COVID boosters on contagiousness ?\nTellingly , the researchers offer a much milder interpretation of their findings .\n\u201c Although vaccination has been shown to reduce the incidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d the authors claim , \u201c we did not find large differences in the median duration of viral shedding among participants who were unvaccinated , those who were vaccinated but not boosted , and those who were vaccinated and boosted.\n\u201d That \u2019 s very likely a careful choice of words \u2013 and perhaps the authors meant they found no statistically significant differences .\nOf course , even if that were true , it still would suggest that getting boosted doesn \u2019 t make you any less likely to spread SARS-CoV-2 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 \u2026 not a great vote of confidence for those three or more doses of the mRNA jab .\nHowever , the authors do point out that their statistical analysis was likely limited given how small their sample size was , which led to \u201c imprecision in the estimates.\n\u201d Do you think the mainstream media will ever showcase this research ?\nDo you think that despite there being evidence showing

also required by law to report the following to VAERS after injecting people with COVID-19 shots : \u2022 Serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defects , a \u201c persist or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions , \u201d death , and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death ( \u2026 but we thought the shots were supposed to prevent

reports of just one or two dozen deaths shortly following a jab would trigger major safety concerns ?\nJust look back at what Dr. Paul Offit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biological disasters in American history : a

and Tufts researchers determined those who eat significant quantities of overly-processed foods have a nearly 30 % higher risk for colorectal cancer .\nColorectal cancer ranks third in terms of the

processed food .\nInterestingly , the study determined that the association above did not apply to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited to men , meaning the excretory systems of men appear particularly vulnerable to the excessive consumption of processed foods .\nBut , in all honesty , we can \u2019 t imagine that processed foods would be good for women to eat .\nWhy did processed foods become so popular so quickly ?\nPart of the reason why processed foods soared in popularity in the 80s and 90s stems from the dynamics of the country \u2019 s marketing laws .\nFormer president Reagan signed off on changes to FCC rules and regulations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including sugar-laden cereals , to impressionable youngsters .\nAdd in the fact that American society shifted away from eating at home to more \u2018 fast \u2019 foods in these two decades , and the stage was set for convenient and affordable processed foods to soar in popularity .\nRead between the lines , and you \u2019 ll glean the following from the study : processed food , including those especially unhealthy processed meats , fall under the umbrella of ultra-processed sustenance that poses a serious threat to human health .\nSuch foods are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiber , spurring weight gain , excretory system malfunctions , colorectal cancer , and additional negative health outcomes .\nStudies similar to the one described above may spur a societal change in which everyday people , federal governments , food-makers , and other industry players agree that it is in the interest of the collective good to minimize or eliminate certain chemical additives from foods .\nFast forward a decade into the future , and you might find ultra-processed foods banned from the shelves or saddled with a utilitarian sin tax similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional details from subsequent studies analyzing the potential risks of consuming ultra-processed foods are revealed in the months ahead .\nThe message here is simple and clear : The more

future side effects of these heavily propagandized COVID-19 injections ?\nAre we about to see a wave of new cancer diagnoses within the next decade ?\nWe recently discussed how some doctors believe rising cancer rates could be linked to gene-based COVID jabs .\nNow , a new analysis published by The Daily Expos\u00e9 offers yet another perspective on this concerning trend .\nDo COVID injections cause cancer ?\nThis data analysis offers compelling and concerning evidence A simple way to think about cancer is \u201c cell growth gone out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the cumulative effects of everything from aging to stress to unhealthy lifestyle choices , is a key trigger of this uncontrolled cellular growth .\nAnd one of the most valuable ways our bodies can prevent this DNA damage is through a mechanism known as the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway .\nHere \u2019 s why this has profound implications for COVID jabs and cancer : It has been shown recently that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein effectively destroys this DNA repair process in white blood cells known as lymphocytes .\n\u201c The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this pathway that it knocked 90 % of it out , \u201d Joel Smalley of The Expos\u00e9 writes , adding that the entire spike protein found in the body after a natural infection is unlikely to get into a cell nucleus and hang around long enough to cause cancer .\n\u201c Unfortunately , \u201d he continues ( emphasis his ) , \u201c the experimental mRNA toxshot induces spike protein to be produced \u2026 in and around the cell nucleus and is produced for at least 60 days and almost certainly longer , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including a 2021 study from Sweden by authors Hui Jiang and Ya-Fang Mei .\nIt is important to note that the Mei and Jiang study has since been retracted due to so-called spurious \u201c expressions of concern.\n\u201d But despite this retraction ( which was allegedly spearheaded by individuals with obvious conflicts of interest , such as an association with the National Institutes of Health , a major funder of Moderna ) , Smalley claims that \u201c the [ vax-induced ] spike protein circulating in large quantities , in the direct vicinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods of time , still has the potential to induce cancer in [ ovary , pancreas , breast , prostate , and lymph node ] cells .\nThese cancers can take years to develop , and so it \u2019 s possible that we don \u2019 t see much of a safety signal for 5 or 10 years.\n\u201d As for the common counterclaim from mainstream vax advocates who say that the vax-induced spike protein doesn \u2019 t get into the cell nucleus , Smalley says mRNA creators submitted pictures of spike proteins getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their emergency use application , \u201d so the claim doesn \u2019 t seem to hold weight .\nJabbed or not , you can protect your health by knowing these early warning signs of cancer Let \u2019 s be clear ( and not alarmist ) : you can \u2019 t tell from signs and symptoms alone whether you have cancer .\nIndeed , many of the following cancer signs and symptoms can also be caused by other conditions , including conditions that are far less serious .\nThat said , you should consult with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the following issues in yourself or a loved one , as they can be early warning signs of cancer , according to the American Cancer Society : \u2022 Extreme fatigue , lethargy , and/or tiredness that doesn \u2019 t get better with rest \u2022 A recent unintentional weight gain or loss of at least 10 pounds without a known reason \u2022 Difficulty eating or swallowing , or an unexplained lack of appetite \u2022 Lumps and swelling anywhere in the body \u2022 New , unexplained pain , especially if this pain persists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin , including scaly rashes , new or changing moles , sores that don \u2019 t heal , or yellow discoloration of the skin and even whites of the eyes ( jaundice ) \u2022 A persistent cough or hoarseness to the voice \u2022 Sores , bleeding , and/or pain or altered sensations in the mouth \u2022 Unexplained changes in bowel and bladder function , including unusual-looking stool , persistent constipation or diarrhea , blood in the urine or stool , pain while passing urine or stool , and new urgency or frequency In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs and symptoms \u2013 and never feeling \u201c bad \u201d or worried about \u201c overreacting \u201d by talking to a trusted doctor about these symptoms \u2013 it may also help to be aware of your individual cancer risk factors .\nThese include family history and environmental factors such as diet , weight , toxin exposure , and smoking history .\nAs with most health conditions , the earlier you get an accurate diagnosis , then the better your chances of a good outcome , at least in most cases .\nSo , don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t know , and trust that you can take responsibility for your health by taking a proactive approach to your well-being .",

close attention to professional and college sports in recent years have noticed an uptick in athlete deaths .\nMore specifically , a growing number of athletes are dropping dead of heart attacks and other heart-related disorders .\nThe question begs : what is causing some of the world \u2019 s top athletes to pass away prematurely ?\nAthlete deaths have spiked a whopping 1,700 % in the aftermath of the COVID-19 vax effort .\nCould the exponential boom in athlete deaths have something to do with the coronavirus injection that became nearly mandatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in society as a whole ?\nThe official statistics on athlete deaths since the start of 2021 show a massive spike in deaths among members of this cohort compared to the annual number of deaths of athletes between 1966 and 2004

characterized by an athlete death total of about 10 times higher than the average rate .\nAs a result , it is fair to question whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially among those age 35 and younger , is the result of the COVID-19 vax .\nWhen will doctors , researchers speak up and admit the \u201c safe and effective \u201d narrative was a lie ?\nThough the scientific community has gone to great lengths to tout the COVID-19 injections as \u201c safe and effective , \u201d data shows quite the opposite .\nSimply put , the shots have caused tremendous harm , do not stop the spread of the virus , nor do they prevent hospitalization or death , especially in vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official messaging , it is not surprising that many believe that the shot is nothing more than an experiment and that those who received it were guinea pigs of sorts .\nAs each day goes by , more data proves that the COVID-19 jabs cause damage to the heart , immune system , and possibly several other organs .\nIn addition , a recent study that analyzed nearly 600 patients who received the Moderna or Pfizer vaxxes showed signs of a higher rate of cardiovascular damage after the second jab .\nThe study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heart attacks increased by more than 100 % following the administering of the jabs .\nThe vax likely contributes to or directly causes cell damage and inflammation , compromising

with mask mandates at all , \u201d concluding that any change in \u201c DGR [ cited by the CDC ] had nothing to do with the imposition of mask mandates , \u201d anyway .\nInstead , the change in daily growth rates \u201c was due to a predictable pattern of any infectious disease as it spreads through a population over time \u2013 whether or not people were forced to wear masks.\n\u201d This is a

and their \u201c effectiveness , \u201d Dr. Setty also uses the same logic and critical appraisal skills to tease apart the misinformation surrounding the so-called \u201c safety and efficacy \u201d of COVID shots for children and pregnant women .\nAs you know , we are told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expecting women , nursing women , and kids as young as six months old should get the COVID jabs .\nYet officials base these recommendations off highly flawed data , says Dr. Setty .\nFor example , the risk of birth defects , miscarriages , and other \u201c untoward outcomes \u201d in pregnancy is \u201c greatest during the first third of pregnancy , a time when crucial embryonic structures are developing , \u201d Dr. Setty explains .\n\u201c This is the period of time where maternal health is particularly important and exposure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be minimized or eliminated entirely if possible.\n\u201d Yet , in the study that the CDC cited to support their claim that COVID shots in pregnancy are safe , only 172 out of over 10,000 ( 1.7 percent ) of the vaxxed mothers received a vax in the first trimester .\nCertainly , this oversight does not allow for an accurate assessment of whether COVID shots are safe for women and their babies early in pregnancy .\nEven the CDC admits this when they say in their paper that \u201c [ b ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposures , aHRs ( adjusted Hazard Ratios ) for first-trimester vaccination could not be calculated.\n\u201d But , Dr. Setty wonders , if they couldn \u2019 t calculate the risk of the COVID shot in the first trimester of pregnancy , \u201c on what basis could they assure the recently pregnant , those who are trying to become pregnant , and those who might become pregnant in the future that this experimental intervention was safe ?\n\u201d Answer : \u201c They couldn \u2019 t \u2013 but they did anyway.\n\u201d Dr. Setty uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart the argument that COVID shots are safe for kids .\nIt is the type of thinking we need to

When anecdotal reports started coming out about women experiencing unusual menstrual changes after being around recently vaxxed people , some concerns were raised about the possibility that these COVID shots were shedding .\nPublic health officials repeatedly reassure the public that these jabs can not be shed since they do not contain any live or weakened version of SARS-CoV-2 .\nBut the has long been on public health radar , and given how \u201c rapidly evolving \u201d the pandemic and pandemic mitigation measures are , many have questioned just how confident we can be with these reassurances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , vax shedding \u201c is the release or discharge of any of the vaccine components in or outside of the body and can only occur when a vaccine contains a live weakened version of the virus.\n\u201d While similar , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \u2019 s definition of vax shedding is as follows : the transmission \u201c of [ virus or bacteria-based gene therapy products ] VBGT or oncolytic products from the patient through one or all of the following ways : excreta ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saliva , nasopharyngeal fluids , etc . )\n; or through the skin ( pustules , sores , wounds ) .\n\u201d While the words \u201c weakened \u201d or \u201c live \u201d do not appear anywhere in their definition , the FDA also clarifies in a footnote that transmission \u201c could occur if the VGBT or oncolytic product is shed in the form of intact viruses or bacteria but not when shed as viral or bacterial degradation products such as nucleic acid fragments \u201d ( emphasis ours ) .\nBy definition , nucleic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nanoparticles found in COVID jabs .\nIn other words , this claim from the FDA supports the idea that COVID shots can not shed \u2013 which certainly is reassuring .\nInterestingly , FDA wrote this definition in a 2015 Guidance for Industry document called \u201c Design and Analysis of Shedding Studies for Virus or Bacteria-Based Gene Therapy and Oncolytic Products.\n\u201d The goal of the document was to help researchers account for \u201c the possibility that the shed VBGT or oncolytic product may be infectious , \u201d which the FDA acknowledges \u201c raises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission to untreated individuals.\n\u201d However , the FDA later states in the same document that an \u201c underestimate of the level of shedding may also result due to degradation of viral or bacterial nucleic acids in enzyme-rich clinical samples such as feces and saliva during storage , handling/shipping and nucleic acid extraction.\n\u201d This seems to go against their earlier footnote clarification and points to a possible method of shedding mRNA-based vaccines \u2013 which is something that Moderna and Pfizer are responsible for investigating as part of their research .\nAs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stir when it noted in its trial documents that reports should be made whenever a pregnant woman is exposed to the vax \u201c by inhalation or skin contact.\n\u201d This is more likely referring to the possibility of exposure to a vax via a broken syringe or spilled vial , however , rather than from a vaccine already injected into someone else .\nEven if Pfizer and Moderna shots don \u2019 t spread COVID-19 , let \u2019 s not forget an important point \u2013 vaxxed individuals still can In any case , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plenty of people have pointed out that even if these COVID shots truly do not shed \u2013 and hopefully , public health officials are right about that \u2013 the fact that the COVID shots do not stop transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a huge problem .\nA vaxxed person who ends up getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 ( which we know is no longer rare ) can easily

technically contribute to viral shedding insofar as they don \u2019 t protect people from the virus .\nAnd who knows ?\nSomeday soon , if Pharma has its way , it could be something other than viral

to fast-track the path to these self-spreading drugs .\nDo you think this is an area of biomedical research that should be focused on so aggressively ?", "author": "Sara Middleton, staff writer",

pandemic has exacted an undeniable physical , emotional , social , and economic toll on the lives of millions of people around the world .\nBut , as with every tragic event , there are silver linings .\nOne of these could be the surge of interest in using mindfulness techniques and nature-based therapies \u2013 such as forest bathing \u2013 to promote psychological and physical healing .\nKnown as Shinrin-yoku in Japan , where this calming practice is considered a therapeutic technique , forest bathing involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere .\nThe concept of forest bathing appears to be \u201c catching on \u201d in other countries , with new British research examining the effects of nature exposure on U.K. citizens during the 2020 lockdown .\nLet \u2019 s look at some of forest bathing \u2019 s science-backed gifts to health .\nForest bathing is not only accepted in Japan but is recognized as a legitimate clinical therapy , with doctors often prescribing it for stressed-out patients .\nAccording to the Forest Bathing Institute , there are now over 70 designated \u201c healing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qing Li and his team at the prestigious Nippon Medical School has helmed much of the forest bathing research .\nDr. Li and other proponents of forest bathing maintain that it can reduce blood pressure , improve heart health , lower blood sugar levels , promote healthy weight , and decrease cortisol levels , the \u201c stress hormone.\n\u201d But the benefits don \u2019 t stop there .\nAccording to Dr. Li , forest bathing can also improve mood , aid concentration , promote restful sleep and enhance creativity .\nIn \u201c The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adult Data , \u201d investigators focused on ways that exposure to natural spaces \u2013 such as parks , woodlands , farmlands , and rivers \u2013 affected people during the 2020 lockdown in the UK .\nWhile the researchers acknowledged that the study was small , the conclusions were dramatic \u2013 and meaningful .\nThe team found that exposure to these natural spaces improved participants \u2019 positive emotions , lessened mood disturbances , and even increased compassion .\nAmong other findings , the researchers learned that about 40 percent of adults reported having spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2020 pandemic restrictions .\nAn overwhelming 85 percent said that being in nature made them happy .\nAnd , those who had visited natural spaces in the week before the survey ( about half of the participants ) reported being significantly happier than those who hadn \u2019 t !\nHowever , the researchers found disturbing inequities in people \u2019 s ability to access nature .\nPeople were less likely to have visited a natural space in the last 14 days if they were living in an area of high deprivation , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational level , or were unemployed .\nAdditional studies support forest bathing to relieve stress and support overall wellness In a 2020 review published in Environmental Health and Preventive Medicine , researchers explored the effects of forest bathing on middle-aged adults with hypertension \u2013 and concluded that forest bathing was \u201c effective \u201d at reducing blood pressure .\nThey also credited forest bathing with lowering pulse rate , improving cardiac-pulmonary parameters , inducing a positive mood , reducing anxiety , and improving quality of life .\n( Whew !\nThat \u2019 s quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furthermore , they found that even a single session of forest bathing could induce short-term benefits .\nIn a separate analysis of literature published just last month in the International Journal of Environmental Health and Research , the authors evaluated 16 systematic reviews and concluded that the \u201c best available evidence supports the use of forest bathing as a complementary practice for the promotion of psychophysical well-being.\n\u201d Trees and plants in natural areas release natural airborne chemicals known as phytoncides .\nInhaling these is thought to be at the heart of forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which help protect plants against harmful insects and disease , are antibacterial and antifungal and are believed to boost immunity in humans by increasing the amount of the body \u2019 s natural killer cells .\nMany researchers believe that phytoncides can even help protect against cancer .\nThe trees thought to be highest in phytoncide release are evergreens , such as pine , fir , spruce , and cedar ( this may explain why pine-scented forest air is so invigorating ) .\nIf you don \u2019 t have access to pine trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a wide variety of plants and trees , including oak , locust , and mangrove trees .\n( By the way , phytoncides are also produced by herbs and spices such as garlic , onion , and rosemary ) .\nOther factors that make forest bathing beneficial include higher oxygen content in the air , the absence of jarring , stressful industrial noise , and the therapeutic benefit of being unplugged \u2013 if only for an hour or two \u2013 from technology .\n( Pro tip : You can make forest bathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving other senses : feeling the rough bark of the trees , listening to the birdsong , noting the

.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Preliminary Findings , \u201d a multidisciplinary team from Germany puts it bluntly : \u201c The COVID-19 vaccination programmes must be stopped immediately.\n\u201d Keep reading to

six-year investigation , which involved over 94,000 older adults with no history of heart failure , used wrist accelerometers to measure the amount and intensity of exercise undertaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who logged a weekly 150 to 300 minutes of moderate physical activity ( such as brisk walking ) lowered their heart failure risk by a surprising 63 percent .\nThose who performed 75 to 150

@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c line of defense \u201d against heart failure Researchers and physicians have long extolled the virtues of exercise , which works in a multitude of ways to promote cardiac function .\nFor one thing , it helps to promote healthy weight , thereby discouraging obesity and other related conditions such as metabolic syndrome , high blood pressure , and type 2 diabetes .\nIt also promotes healthy circulation and elimination , helping to detoxify and clear the body of waste and harmful compounds .\nIn addition , it improves oxygen utilization and reduces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body while alleviating stress , which has been shown to place a burden on the heart .\nFinally \u2013 and most obviously \u2013 regular exercise helps to strengthen the muscles , including the most important muscle of all : the heart .\nUnsurprisingly , researchers report that people with high blood pressure , high cholesterol , high blood sugar , and obesity benefit the most from exercise

physical activity based on their current lifestyle and health status .\n\u201c Moderate physical activity is \u2026 generally safer , \u201d Dr. Ho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brisk walking falls into the category of moderate activity .\nIf you \u2019 re already a fan of regular walks , Dr. Ho advocates upping your speed and walking briskly to increase the intensity and potential benefits .\nAnd , if you find yourself inclined to do a bit more than the suggested amount , go for it ( with the approval of your doctor , of course .\nAll exercise regimes for heart failure should be undertaken with medical supervision ) .\nThe study results suggest that going beyond the current AHA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 minutes per week ) could provide even greater protection against heart failure .\nJust be careful not to overdo it , which can lead to injury or adverse events .\nIf walking isn \u2019 t your \u201c thing , \u201d other AHA-recommended forms of moderate exercise include ballroom dancing , water aerobics , and biking at speeds of under 10 miles an hour .\nBy the way , multiple studies and reviews have showcased the ability of hawthorn extract to reduce shortness of breath and fatigue while increasing

drugmakers simply don \u2019 t want people to know what \u2019 s really inside ( or not inside ) .\nA March 2021 feature investigation article published by The British Medical Journal explores this hush-hush concern over COVID jab inconsistencies .\nData leak from European Medicines Agency reveals concerning reality about \u201c mRNA instability \u201d The BMJ article in question , titled \u201c The EMA covid-19 data leak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mRNA instability , \u201d begins by explaining a shocking situation that occurred back in December 2020 : The European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) was the victim of a cyberattack .\nThis cyberattack happened to occur when the EMA was analyzing the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vax .\nAs a result , \u201c More than 40 megabytes of classified information from the agency \u2019 s review were published on the dark web , and several journalists \u2013 including from The BMJ \u2013 and academics worldwide were sent copies of the leaks.\n\u201d After reviewing these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c had major concerns over unexpectedly low quantities of intact mRNA in batches of the vaccine developed for commercial production.\n\u201d One leaked November 2020 email from a \u201c high ranking EMA official \u201d outlined several concerning issues about the inconsistencies with the COVID shots .\nCompared to the shots used in clinical trials , for example , nearly 60 to 80 % of the commercial shots had \u201c a significant difference in % RNA integrity/truncated species.\n\u201d \u201c In short , \u201d The BMJ article explains , \u201c commercial manufacturing was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regulators were unsure of the implications.\n\u201d The article also suggests that these problems with mRNA integrity were not entirely unexpected , saying that \u201c RNA instability is one of the biggest hurdles for researchers developing nucleic acid based vaccines.\n\u201d Writing for Children \u2019 s Health Defense , Dr. Joseph Mercola puts it bluntly : \u201c The reason health officials don \u2019 t want individual vaccine vials examined by independent scientists is that the vials are all different \u2013 and the mRNA in the shots is not intact.\n\u201d Inconsistency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain their ineffectiveness , safety concerns If the mRNA found in these mandated injections is not intact nor stable , this could help explain why these jabs are so ineffective at preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 .\nThe BMJ cited a 2021 article from The Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences in which authors noted that the \u201c complete , intact mRNA molecule is essential to its potency as a vaccine \u201d and that \u201c [ e ] ven a minor degradation reaction , anywhere along an mRNA strand , can severely slow or stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus result in the incomplete expression of the target antigen.\n\u201d The inconsistencies with mRNA stability go beyond shot effectiveness , of course .\nThis revelation from leaked EMA data certainly calls into question the safety of these drugs .\nFor example , it \u2019 s plausible that the lack of mRNA integrity could explain why some lots or batches of COVID shots given to the public are associated with greater numbers of severe side effects and deaths , while other lots or batches appear much better tolerated .\nUnfortunately \u2013 and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel and rushed regulatory process surrounding these drugs in general \u2013 there are no specific regulatory guidelines in place for integrity standards of mRNA-based vaxxes at this point .\nAnd despite reaching out to Pfizer , Moderna , EMA , and other stakeholders , the BMJ was \u201c unsuccessful \u201d in its attempt to \u201c clarify current standards .\n\u201d", "author": "Sara Middleton, staff writer", "url":

about how the industry \u2019 s cost-cutting ways have resulted in unhealthy food with minimal nutrients , empty calories , and addictive ingredients .\nIt wasn \u2019 t long ago when the fruits and

.\nHowever , consumers are busy to the point that they can not keep track of Big Agriculture \u2019 s practices .\nSo here are the dirty details on the state of the world \u2019 s food industry .\nThough few are aware of it , phosphate fertilizer used by Big Agriculture is slightly radioactive due to its unique component referred to as polonium-210 .\nThe problem with using even a small amount of this radioactive element is that it has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we depend on for sustenance and continued health .\nRewind to 2015 , glyphosate used within the aforementioned fertilizer was formally labeled as a human carcinogen .\nGlyphosate is tied to many health issues , including damage to the internal organs over time and even cancer .\nThough the scientific and medical communities are not completely certain phosphate directly causes cancer , it is clear that it is a toxic component that Big Agriculture must address in due time .\nThe word \u201c biosolids \u201d ( sewage sludge ) certainly sounds intimidating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex as they appear on their surface .\nThe fertilizer used to grow crops contains PFAS chemicals .\nSuch chemicals are much more likely to cause health problems , including issues with the thyroid , liver , and other internal organs .\nCrops serve as the conduit between the toxic components and the consumer , ultimately compromising the human body as time progresses .\nIf BIG AG is going to re-establish a rapport with the public , it will have to address the use of toxic sludge for crop growth in the near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t shown a willingness to alter their ways , meaning toxic sludge will be used to grow the food we need for sustenance until consumers and/or food industry regulators take action .\nWeed killer causes DNA and

and possibly even damage to the acorn-shaped pineal gland in the center of the brain that might one day be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human body .\nDamage to the pineal gland is tied to neurological problems and gut dysbiosis , diseases ranging from Parkinson \u2019 s to anxiety , depression , and even autism .\nPineal gland damage might also catalyze the release of a hormone that stimulates the thyroid , potentially setting the stage for hypothyroidism to develop across the aging process .\nThe answer to this quandary is simple : consumers should consider boycotting Big Agriculture in favor of smaller , local farmers who grow organic crops without weed killers and other chemical-laden products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up regulations on Big Agriculture , forcing the industry to clean up its practices and grow

vaccines.\n\u201d \u201c Today ( August 31 ) , our study of serious adverse events in the Pfizer and Moderna phase 3 covid-19 vaccine trials was published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results showed the Pfizer and Moderna both exhibited an absolute risk increase of serious adverse events of special interest ( combined , 1 per 800 vaccinated ) , raising concerns that mRNA vaccines are associated with more harm than initially estimated at the time of emergency authorization \u201d ( emphasis ours ) .\n\u201c We acknowledge that our estimates are only approximations because the original data remain sequestered , \u201d the researchers continue ( emphasis ours ) .\n\u201c For example , we could not stratify by age , which would help clarify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nA more definitive determination of the actual harms and benefits requires individual participant data ( IPD ) that remain unavailable to research investigators.\n\u201d The researchers urge that Pfizer and Moderna release their clinical trial data immediately and call for \u201c transparency , reproducibility , and replication.\n\u201d \u201c Covid-19 vaccines are now among the most widely disseminated medicines in the history of the world , \u201d they say .\n\u201c Yet , results from the pivotal clinical trials can not be verified by independent analysts .\nThe public has a legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data .\nCOVID vaccinations have cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars , perhaps even rivaling the annual NIH budget for all aspects of biomedical and behavioral research.\n\u201d In related news , White House pledges to remove paywall from publicly funded research Here \u2019 s a wild idea : taxpayers should be able to access , read , and share research that their hard-earned dollars help fund .\nThe current precedent , however , is that a significant number of these federally funded clinical trials are hidden behind hefty paywalls .\nThankfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upcoming policy change that should help promote even more research transparency .\nIn a memorandum dated August 25 , 2022 , Dr. Alondra Nelson , acting head of the White House \u2019 s Office of Science and Technology Policy , called for federal agencies \u201c as soon as possible , and no later than December 31 , 2025 , to make publications and their supporting data resulting from federally funded research publicly accessible without an embargo on their free and public release.\n\u201d \u201c The American people fund tens of billions of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in a news release about the policy change .\n\u201c There should be no delay or barrier between the American public and the returns on their investments in research.\n\u201d We applaud any effort by government officials and private scientists alike to make science more accessible to the people impacted .", "author": "Sara Middleton, staff writer", "url":

hyperinflammatory illness \u201d caused by COVID-19 .\nIn this article , let \u2019 s take a closer look at this study and point out some inconsistencies that the CDC seems to ignore as they continue to push for more and more jabs for juveniles .\nNew CDC study tries to claim that COVID shots prevent Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome due to COVID-19 \u2013 instead , provides evidence of adverse effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled \u201c Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome after Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 Infection in 2 Immunized Adolescents , United States , \u201d was conducted by researchers affiliated with the University of Colorado Aurora .\nThe study cites two cases of children who experienced ( and recovered from ) a suspected \u201c hyperinflammatory illness \u201d called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children ( MIS-C ) .\nAccording to the CDC , MIS-C occurs \u201c after SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\u201d Let \u2019 s look at some things that both of these children had in common : \u2022 Both kids ( one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy 14-year-olds \u2022 Both kids had completed their two-dose series of Pfizer COVID shots three months before they were brought to the hospital with concerning symptoms , including fever , fatigue , congestion , cough , myalgias , headache , nausea , vomiting , bloodshot eyes , abdominal pain , and rash ( the boy also happened to have developed symptomatic COVID-19 infection just one month after getting vaxxed ! )\n\u2022 Upon presenting to the hospital , both kids were diagnosed with a variety of health issues , including hyponatremia ( low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( low platelets in the blood ) , sepsis ( severe widespread infection ) , and impaired cardiac and liver function If COVID shots are supposed to protect against COVID-19 and protect against severe illness , then why on earth would the CDC brandish these two case reports as a sign of COVID shot success ?\nRemember , these are \u201c fully vaxxed \u201d previously healthy children who already had a significantly low risk of severe complications associated with natural SARS-CoV-2 infection because of their young age \u2026 yet these children become sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they required hospitalization .\nTrying to claim that their vax status somehow prevented their illnesses from getting worse seems like nothing more than grasping for straws from the CDC .\nNext , let \u2019 s consider an alternative explanation that the CDC seems to willfully ignore : that their vax status was the explicit reason they experienced severe complications as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection , a painful medical irony caused by a phenomenon known as Vaccine-Associated Enhanced Disease ( VAED ) .\nPfizer , FDA has identified vax-associated enhanced disease as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots , acknowledges lack of data to understand true risk VAED has been defined as \u201c a rarely-observed phenomenon whereby vaccination promotes immune responses that exacerbate the disease caused by subsequent infection with the associated pathogen \u201d ( see an April 2022 review article from Frontiers in Immunology ) .\nIn other words , getting vaxxed against a virus drives harmful immune system changes that make a person even sicker once exposed to the virus ( instead of more protected ) .\nIn these hopefully rare cases , the vax would do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed \u201d to do .\nVAED could absolutely explain why these children suffered from MIS-C after getting a \u201c breakthrough \u201d COVID-19 illness .\nAnd it \u2019 s not as if VAED isn \u2019 t on Pfizer \u2019 s radar .\nIn Table 5 , page 11 of a confidential report from Pfizer called \u201c 5.3.6 CUMULATIVE ANALYSIS OF POST-AUTHORIZATION ADVERSE EVENT REPORTS OF PF-07302048 ( BNT162B2 ) RECEIVED THROUGH

following data : \u201c VAED may present as severe or unusual clinical manifestations of COVID-19 .\nOverall , there were 37 subjects with suspected COVID-19 and 101 subjects with confirmed COVID-19 following one or both doses of the vaccine ; 75 of the 101 cases were severe , resulting in hospitalisation , disability , life-threatening consequences , or death .\nNone of the 75 cases could be definitively considered as [ VAED ] .\nIn this review of subjects with COVID-19 following vaccination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VAED ] remains a theoretical risk for the vaccine .\nSurveillance will continue.\n\u201d We are not claiming that the cases of these two unfortunate 14-year-old kids prove VAED .\nHowever , we are concerned that the CDC and other researchers seem so willing to ignore VAED as a possible explanation .\nJust how many people are harmed by these shots and put at even MORE risk when exposed to circulating coronavirus variants ?\nIs adequate surveillance honestly being

collars are marketed as safe and highly effective .\nHowever , many of these seemingly harmless collars contain an insidious chemical with s \u2013 not only for pets but also for children and adults .\nWhy would anyone use these pet collars ?\nOver half of flea and tick collars sold in the United States contain the chemical tetrachlorvinphos ( TCVP ) .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a risk of neurological damage in children .\nTCVP belongs to a class of chemicals known as organophosphates , first created as nerve agents around World War 2 .\nOrganophosphates raised such health concerns that most were banned for household use after 1996 .\nYet , TCVP has remained a common component of popular flea and tick collars .\nThe Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has recently moved to ban collars that contain TVCP in light of its risk to human health .\nBut it \u2019 s hard to say how long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTCVP exposure linked to autism and lower IQ in children This isn \u2019 t the first time concerns about TCVP have been raised .\nIn 2009 , the National Resource Defense Council implored the EPA to ban the chemical .\nA study conducted during the Obama administration revealed that children experience high TCVP exposure through pet flea and tick collars .\nSadly , this high chemical exposure could put kids at higher risk of attention disorders , autism , lowered IQ , and even delayed mental development .\nFurthermore , although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemicals every 15 years , the agency hasn \u2019 t reviewed TVCP use since 2006 .\nFortunately , the EPA is now moving forward with scrutinizing TVCP .\nTVCP isn \u2019 t the only problematic chemical in popular flea and tick collars .\nMany more contain pesticides like imidacloprid and flumethrin , which may also harm pets and people .\nWhat can you do to reduce your exposure ?\nThe presence of harmful chemicals in flea and tick collars is troubling .\nAnd even though it may not be possible to completely eliminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take steps to reduce your family \u2019 s exposure risk .\nFor one , it \u2019 s important to read ingredient labels thoroughly .\nAny product containing a lengthy list of hard-to-pronounce ingredients is likely bad news .\nTry to eat organic , local foods , purify your water and choose natural and organic bedding .\nThere are also several natural alternatives to toxic flea and tick collars \u2013 for example , citrus functions as a flea repellant .\nFleas can \u2019 t hang onto fur in a bath , so you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep fleas away .\nFeeding Brewer \u2019 s yeast to your dog or cat may also deter fleas from your pet .\nSome essential oils , like geranium oil , may help repel ticks .\nYou should check your pet daily for ticks , especially if they \u2019 ve been in a wooded area .\nOur children and pets are the most important parts of our lives , and we want to keep them safe .\nAvoiding toxic flea and tick collars is one way to decrease health risks to your

government is gearing up yet again for another winter season , urging everyone to get their booster shot for COVID and to be sure to get their flu shot at the same time , insisting it is perfectly safe to do so \u2013 although at least one Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) study recently published in JAMA Network Open suggests that getting both shots simultaneously can increase uncomfortable side effects by more than 10 % .\nThe mainstream media is also busy pushing the narrative that these shots are well worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Boston.com on October 26 : \u201c If you \u2019 re boosted , COVID almost definitely won \u2019 t kill you \u201d ( emphasis ours ) .\nThe article goes on to quote Dr. Ashish Jha , head of the White House COVID task force , who casually mentions that people who are \u201c up to date \u201d with their shots have a risk of death from COVID-19 that is \u201c close to zero \u201d if they end up getting a breakthrough infection and

narrative pushing , however , it seems that more and more people are getting fed up \u2013 and are even taking legal action to take a stand .\nAs reported by Becker News , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts is currently handling one of the first-ever lawsuits arguing that \u201c fraud \u201d was committed by the U.S. government against the American people during the COVID-19 pandemic .\nPlaintiff John Paul Beaudoin and his legal team are filing the lawsuit against Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker , the public health examiner , and the chief medical examiner , among other state stakeholders .\nThey describe their litigation as \u201c a request for injunctive relief where the source of fraudulent misrepresentation , purposely conducted , continues to harm both Plaintiff and the public.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unceremoniously kicked out of the Massachusetts School of Law for declining the COVID injections \u2013 despite the fact that Beaudoin has sincere religious beliefs and \u201c four pre-existing health issues consistent with thousands of COVID-19 vaccine injuries reported to VAERS even as of April 2021 \u201d that his lawyers argue should have granted him exemption from the shots .\n\u201c Most , if not all , law schools require COVID-19 vaccination and do so based on the fraudulent misinformation issued by the CDC and [ Food and Drug Administration ] and sourced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts Department of Public Health ] , \u201d the lawsuit says .\n\u201c Plaintiff is injured in being deprived of a legal education offered to all those who assume the risk of COVID-19 vaccination.\n\u201d Among their evidence , the plaintiffs cite more than four dozen deaths coded by the state of Massachusetts as COVID-19-related deaths but were very strongly linked to recent COVID-19 injections .\nAs Becker News eloquently points out , because these COVID shots do not prevent transmission , \u201c vaccination is solely and indisputably a matter of personal health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter that should solely be at a patient \u2019 s discretion with the consultation of his or her doctor.\n\u201d It follows that banning people from free mobilization in society , blocking their access to higher education ( as in the case of second-year law student Beaudoin ) , and threatening them with job loss and financial hardship is an egregious example of punitive , unethical , federally-funded medical coercion .\nPerhaps it comes as no surprise that people who have serious concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic are being largely written off as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a thinly veiled attempt to discredit or silence anyone who doesn \u2019 t agree with the mainstream pandemic narrative hook , line , and sinker .\nOne recent study published in PLOS One even suggests that belief in COVID fraud is a \u201c gateway \u201d to other conspiracy theories , such as the 2020 election fraud .\nAdmitting that their hypothesis is \u201c speculative , \u201d the study \u2019 s senior author Russell Fazio claims that people who believe in one conspiratorial idea are more likely to generally distrust institutions .\nDiscussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c some past

.\nSpecifically , studies have shown that it prevents the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids , thereby protecting the vital fatty membrane layers of cells .\nAdditional studies have demonstrated that alpha-tocopherol reduces oxidative stress markers while increasing glutathione levels , the body \u2019 s master antioxidant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that vitamin E may even help to suppress abnormal cell growth , allowing it to potentially discourage the development of cancer .\nRoughly one in ten Americans over 50 have osteoporosis , a condition in which bones become brittle and prone to breakage

In the earlier half of the pandemic , the COVID shot was sold to the public as the best way to end the crisis and the right thing to do to protect yourself and others , as officials and Big Pharma

that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \u201c quietly disclosed \u201d the fact that elderly people in the United States who had received the Pfizer COVID shot were experiencing four serious adverse events .\nThese serious adverse events , discovered via Medicare healthcare system claims , were released by the FDA way back in July 2021 after what the agency says was \u201c near real-time

will share further updates and information with the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time , Maryanne Demasi pointed out in her feature report , was that \u201c little was provided , such as the magnitude

\u201d Why the delay ?\nThe BMJ report goes on to say that the FDA claims study findings are expected later this fall .\nMultiple other studies corroborate Medicare healthcare findings that the FDA said indicated potential adverse events among jabbed elderly As mentioned , the FDA was very quick to downplay the four serious safety concerns identified among Medicare healthcare claims for elderly individuals who had received the shot .\nWithout any proof to support their claims , the agency even immediately offered \u201c alternative explanations \u201d for the increased rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Despite the emotional and physical toll it takes on women , doctors continue to advocate for extreme treatments \u2013 including double mastectomies \u2013 when mammography results show certain abnormal breast cells .\nYet , research shows such measures are unnecessary for patient survival .\nStage 0 breast cancer \u2013 ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) \u2013 accounts for 20 % of all newly diagnosed breast cancers .\nUpon diagnosis , most women will rely on their physicians \u2019 recommendations to have a lumpectomy , mastectomy , or even double mastectomy , despite the lack of evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior : Should we really be doing this to women ?\nStage O breast cancer condition equates to the finding of abnormal cells confined to the milk ducts of the breast .\nDiagnosed cases of DCIS have soared in recent years due to advanced mammography , which is now able to detect even the smallest of lesions .\nBefore mammograms became available around 1980 , the number of women diagnosed with DCIS each year tallied only in the hundreds .\nIf deadly breast cancers actually started out as DCIS , then the incidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declined immensely as DCIS detection rose .\nBut that simply hasn \u2019 t been the case .\nInstead , evidence shows that patients with this condition have no greater likelihood of dying of breast cancer than women in the general population .\nDespite this , breast cancer surgeons have aggressively treated women with DCIS , much as they would patients showing advanced stages of breast cancer , even advocating double mastectomies with the removal of a healthy breast in some cases .\nRecently published research results suggest these treatments are totally unnecessary .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recently published findings of a study involving about 100,000 women diagnosed with DCIS who were tracked for 20 years .\nTheir results were published in JAMA Oncology .\nIn the study , women undergoing severe surgical procedures \u2013 whether lumpectomies or mastectomies \u2013 continued to have the same likelihood of developing breast cancer as the general population of women .\nThe few women in the study who did die , according to researchers , did so despite treatment , not because treatment was lacking .\nThese findings strongly suggest that thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes disfiguring treatments without any benefit .\nThe premalignant conditions they are diagnosed with are unlikely to ever develop into life-threatening cancers .\nDespite such evidence , some doctors , including the chief breast cancer surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , have gone on record to state they do not see a reason to halt their aggressive approaches .\nIn an interview with The New York Times , Dr. Otis W. Brawley , former chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society , stated he had no plans to abandon aggressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHowever , at the same time , Dr. Brawley said he had no doubt treatment had been overly aggressive , chalking it up to over-zealous medical providers .\nYet , the doctor made no apologies for the impact such misplaced enthusiasm has had on thousands of women \u2019 s lives .\nAs long as breast cancer surgeons continue to push for invasive treatments despite evidence that it does no good , such treatment for DCIS will only add to the list of costly , invasive healthcare procedures medical facilities are performing routinely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t let fear control your behavior \u2013 especially with healthcare decisions In this case , some patients are falling victim to disfigurement that will impact them for the rest of their lives .\nResearch has shown that women undergoing severe treatments typically do so out of fear without realizing the short and long-term implications .\nYet , in addition to complications from the surgery itself , research has shown that women who get cancer treatment are less likely to stay employed and those that do , earn less than before .\nAnd finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on relationships and bring about unnecessary emotional stress .", "author": "Lori Alton, staff writer", "url":

effects .\nThis newly identified mechanism of vitamin K shows that vitamin K has an uncanny ability to combat cancer at multiple stages .\nResearchers have shown the distinct ways that vitamin K2 stops the proliferation of cancer cells .\nThese studies confirm diet and supplementation are the healthiest ways to curtail malignancies .\nVitamin K is a group name for a number of related compounds .\nEach one serves an essential purpose in the prevention of cancer .\nVitamin K1 and K2 are the two natural forms of the vitamin \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of development .\nThe anti-tumor action of vitamin K has been under investigation since 1947 .\nBut , only recently has it been discovered that different forms of vitamin K can actually stop the creation of cancer cells .\nVitamin K affects the tumors by modifying growth factors and receptor molecules \u2013 which make cells less able to stimulate tumor growth and progression .\nThe cell cycle becomes frozen and can not create any further cells .\nIt also creates programmed cell death through distinctive mechanisms .\nOne of the most unique methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a form of stress-activated ischemic cell demise \u2013 and tumor cells are particularly vulnerable to this process .\nTumors can rapidly outgrow their blood supplies , and due to their high metabolism , they also use up oxygen rapidly .\nThe latter makes them

toxicity to healthy tissues .\nPersistent stress often leads to chronic cell injury and , eventually , the cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another way to get rid of cancer cells besides getting them to commit suicide , which is known as apoptosis .\nAnother unique mechanism of vitamin K , demonstrated recently in bile duct cancers and leukemia , is autophagy , in which cancer cells essentially eat themselves by releasing their own digestive enzymes internally .\nBy still another mechanism , vitamin C and K in combination contribute to cancer cell death by autoschizis , whereby cells simply split open , spilling their contents .\nPlus , in case you \u2019 re wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uruguay demonstrated that serum markers in a group of prostate cancer patients indicated tumor cell destruction following supplementation with vitamins C and K. Another study , the \u201c European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition \u201d involved over 24,000 participants from ages 35 to 64 , all who were free of cancer when enrolled in the

with a dramatic reduction in lung and prostate cancer among the individuals in the study .\nAt the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota , researchers have found that people with higher intakes of vitamin K have a lower risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma .\nIn this study , vitamin K1 ( found mostly in leafy greens ) showed a preventative value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the highest levels of vitamin K1 from diet and/or supplements had a 45 % less risk for developing this form of lymphoma .\nIn addition , researchers in Japan discovered that vitamin K2 may play a role in preventing the type of liver cancer

broccoli , lettuce , cabbage , collard greens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avocado , and other leafy green vegetables .\nVitamin K2 is found in meat , dairy , and natto \u2013 a Japanese soy product .\nObviously ,

ancient ancestors grew up in a world of stress and scarcity .\nFood was often not available , and intermittent fasting was common .\nThis form of life left a genetic blueprint with key information about our health and well-being .\nIntermittent fasting helps eliminate fatigue , calm inflammatory conditions in the body , and starves off cancer cell formation .\nIt is by no mistake that when animals get sick , they stop eating and instead focus on resting .\nThis is a primal instinct to reduce stress on their internal system so their body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows the animal to concentrate all their internal energy systems toward immunity .\nHumans are the only species that often look for more food during illness .\nThe importance of \u201c energy conservation \u201d within the body The body has a certain amount of available energy that it diverts into essential functions such as digestion , physical movement ( kinetics ) , immunity , cognition , etc .\nThe continual need to digest food diverts energy away from these other factors , while fasting conserves energy for use with these other systems .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast amounts of blood and is considered energy expensive .\nWhen we eat food , the immune system gets activated to increase inflammatory conditions to ward off any unwanted microorganisms within the food .\nThis happens whether the food is raw or cooked , as nothing is truly sterile .\nWhen the immune system activates to attack newly ingested pathogens , it uses energy reserves that could be used for other activities .\nFasting frees these white blood cells to destroy dormant infections and other problematic areas .\nThe practice of fasting allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus into the process of effective immune regulation .\nFasting while drinking water and other cleansing beverages will flush out the digestive system and reduces the number of natural microorganisms in the gut .\nThe immune system typically regulates the microorganism count .\nSo this allows the immune system to divert energy to other , more important areas .\nIntermittent fasting is a terrific regulator of the immune system as it controls the number of inflammatory cytokines that are released in the body .\nTwo major cytokines , Interleukin-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body .\nStudies have shown that fasting reduces the release of these inflammatory mediators .\nThe immune system modulation that intermittent fasting provides may also be helpful if you have moderate to severe allergies .\nThe key to having a robust immune system and protecting yourself from cancer Fasting also stimulates the process of autophagy , where the body breaks down old , damaged cells and abnormally developing cells to recycle for energy .\nThe process of autophagy is part of the innate immune system and utilizes pattern recognition receptors to identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autophagy processes which restrict viral infections and the replication of intracellular parasites .\nThis catabolic process helps the body rid itself of intracellular pathogens and abnormal cancer cell development .\nIt is also important in protecting the brain and tissue cells from abnormal growth , toxicity , and chronic inflammation .\nThe connection between intermittent fasting and autoimmune disease Individuals with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus , rheumatoid arthritis , colitis , and Crohn \u2019 s disease have seen a tremendous improvement in symptoms with the incorporation of intermittent fasting .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and allows for more normalized immune function .\nCancer cells are known to have anywhere from ten to thirty times more insulin receptors than normal cells and depend upon the anaerobic metabolism of sugar for fuel .\nIntermittent fasting starves cancer cells and leaves them vulnerable to free radical damage and ultimate destruction .\nKeep in mind , a \u201c true \u201d fast is 24 hours or more , but intermittent fasting certainly has many health benefits to explore .\nAbout the author : Dr. David Jockers is the creator of the website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of \u201c Super Charge Your Brain.\n\u201d He is also a featured speaker in many of Jonathan
