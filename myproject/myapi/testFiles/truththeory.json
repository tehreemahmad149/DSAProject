fact that it is one of the most developed nations in the world .\nNow , the question stands- why is it so ?\nWhy do Americans have such a low life expectancy despite having an expansive and expensive healthcare system ?\nSome of the causes that you might have guessed by now would be the far higher death rate from obesity , drinking , smoking , racial homicides , drug overdose , infant deaths ,

surface , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the US would be the racial and social inequality that still plagues the country .\nWhile Americans do have a higher average income than most people in developer countries , the other end of the spectrum is equally bad .\nThe incomes of the poorest Americans are far lower than the incomes of the poorest people in other developed countries .\nThe syllogism is clear- less income would involve a worse standard of living , leading to a high mortality rate .", "author": "Mayukh Saha", "url": "https://truththeory.com/life-expectancy-in-the-us-low-expensive-healthcare/",

conjure up images of snowy mountain ranges , frozen ice rinks and athletes in cold-weather gear .\nAnd for good reason .\nWinter Olympic venues have often been in places that receive an average snowfall of 300 inches per year or more .\nHowever , barring some extremely anomalous weather patterns , the mountains surrounding the snow events for the Beijing Winter Olympics will be tones of brown and green and nearly devoid of snow .\nThe region typically receives only a few inches of snowfall in each winter month .\nThis means that basically all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on will be human-made .\nI am an atmospheric scientist who specializes in mountain weather and snow .\nI am also the co-founder of a snowmaking startup and an avid skier .\nThere are distinct differences between natural and artificial snow , and it will be interesting to see if these differences have any effect on competition .\nThough artificial snow and natural snow are both frozen water , most skiers and snowboarders are able to immediately recognize that the two are very different .\nTraditional snowmaking uses high pressure water , compressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid droplets into the air that then freeze as they fall to the ground .\nBut snowmaking is not as simple as just making sure the air is sufficiently cold .\nPure water does not freeze until it is cooled to nearly -40 F ( -40 C ) .\nIt is only the presence of microscopic suspended particles in water that allow it to freeze at the familiar 32 F ( 0 C ) .\nThese particles , known as ice nuclei , act as a sort of scaffolding to help ice crystals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggles to turn into ice .\nDifferent particles can raise or lower freezing temperatures depending on their specific molecular configuration .\nTwo of the best ice nuclei are silver iodide and a protein produced by the bacteria Pseudomonas syringae .\nMost snowmaking systems add a commercial form of the bacterial protein to water to ensure most of the tiny droplets freeze before they hit the ground .\nNatural snow starts as a tiny ice crystal on an ice nucleus in a cloud .\nAs the crystal falls through the air , it slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By comparison , human-made snow freezes quickly from a single droplet of water .\nThe resulting snow consists of billions of tiny spherical balls of ice .\nIt may resemble natural snow to the naked eye on a ski run , but the natural and artificial snow \u201c feel \u201d very different .\nDue to the fact that the tiny ice balls pack together quite densely \u2013 and that some of them may have not frozen until they touched the ground \u2013 artificial snow often feels hard and icy .\nFresh natural \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , provides skiers and snowboarders an almost weightless feeling as they soar down the mountainside .\nThis is largely because the natural snow crystals stack very loosely \u2013 a fresh layer of powder is as much as 95 % or more air .\nWhile fresh powder is what most recreational skiers dream of , Olympic skiers have different tastes .\nRacers want to be able to glide as fast as possible and use their sharp edges to make powerful , tight turns .\nThe dense , icy conditions of artificial snow are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , race organizers often add liquid water to race courses of natural snow which will freeze and ensure a durable , consistent surface for racers .\nAnother consideration is the fact that natural snowstorms produce dull , flat lighting and low visibility \u2013 hard conditions to race or jump in .\nHeavy natural snowfall will often cancel ski races , as happened during the snowy 1998 Nagano Games .\nFor racers , clear skies and artificial snow provide the advantage there , too .\nBut hard human-made snow does have its downsides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying off jumps or sliding on rails high above the ground seem to prefer the softer surface of natural snow for safety reasons .\nThis is also true of Nordic skiers , who recently flagged the dangers of artificial snow in the

recreational skiers , natural snow is far better .\nDue to the air-filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more enjoyable to ski or snowboard on .\nScientists have been trying for decades to create more natural snow on demand .\nThe first way that people tried to make \u201c real \u201d snow was by seeding natural clouds with silver iodide .\nThe goal was to facilitate moisture in clouds turning into falling snow crystals .\nIf you could make this process \u2013 called the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process \u2013 occur more easily , it would theoretically increase the snowfall rate .\nIn practice , it has historically been difficult to prove the efficacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using large , meticulously deployed sets of atmospheric instruments has shown that \u2013 for a fraction of storms with the proper

natural snow crystals .\nScientists have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades , but the process is delicate , and typically researchers only produce a few flakes at a time .\nBecause ice crystals typically grow slowly , it has been tricky for researchers to scale the process up by the many orders of magnitude needed to grow enough snow for skiing .\nBut in a quest to produce fluffy powder for skiers and

ultimate goal of clinical adoption of histotripsy treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Treatment Done On The Lab Rats This treatment was pioneered and developed at the University of Michigan and offers new hope for the patients who suffer from this deadly cancer .\nThe 5-year survival rate for liver cancer is presently much lower than 18 % in the United States .\nHistotripsy uses an ultrasound transducer to disrupt cancerous tumors instead of bouncing off internal structures for imaging .\nIt works by ultrasound cavitation and is almost similar to the technique used to non-invasively break down fat cells to treat weight loss .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ area and the vibrations generate tiny bubbles in the targeted tissues .\nWhen these bubbles burst , the tissues get disrupted and it destroys that part of the tumor .\nIt is obviously not possible to target the entire tumor and the way these cancerous masses are positioned influences whether this technique is safe to use on the entire tumor .\nPartial treatment had resulted in complete regression in almost 81 % of the treated rats , as per the researchers .\n100 % of the control rats had shown tumor progression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed

metastasis.\n\u201d 22 laboratory rats were implanted with liver cancer , where half was left as a control group and the remaining were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 50 and 75 % of the tumor volume .\n3 rats were treated to a lesser extent , where this technique targeted just 25 % of the tumor volume .\nAfter the treatment , the experimental rodents were euthanized and dissected to find out how successful the treatment had been .\nThe scientists looked for signs of progression , metastasis , and immune markers .\nThe results that came from the control rats were poor as all of them showed signs of progression and metastasis .\nThe tumors had reached their maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedures and the animals were euthanized .\nThe treated rats fared much better .\nThe treatment proceeded without any complications or side effects and 9 out of 11 rats showed tumor regression and experienced tumor-free survival for the rest of the study , for around 10 weeks .\nPrevious studies had shown that histotripsy was effective at reducing tumor volume .\nThis new work showed that it increased survival rates post-treatment .\n\u201c This study demonstrated the potential of histotripsy for successful non-invasive tumor ablation and prevention of local tumor progression and metastasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local tumor regression was observed in 9 of 11 treatment rats , with no recurrence or metastasis up to the 12-week study endpoint , as evidenced by MRI and histology , \u201d the researchers wrote in their paper .\n\u201c These results suggest that histotripsy may not increase the risk of developing metastases post-ablation , as compared to controls .\nFuture studies will continue to investigate the safety , efficacy , and biological effects of histotripsy , for potential translation to the

probably Not Caused By A Chemical Imbalance In The Brain \u2013 New\u00a0Study", "content": "For three decades , people have been deluged with information suggesting that depression is caused by a \u201c chemical imbalance \u201d in the brain \u2013 namely an imbalance of a brain chemical called serotonin .\nHowever , our latest research review shows that the evidence does not support it .\nYou can listen to more articles from The Conversation , narrated by Noa , here .\nAlthough first proposed in the 1960s , the serotonin theory of depression started to be widely promoted by the pharmaceutical industry in the 1990s in association with its efforts to market a new range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhibitors or SSRIs .\nThe idea was also endorsed by official institutions such as the American Psychiatric Association , which still tells the public that \u201c differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression \u201d .\nCountless doctors have repeated the message all over the world , in their private surgeries and in the media .\nPeople accepted what they were told .\nAnd many started taking antidepressants because they believed they had something wrong with their brain that required an antidepressant to put right .\nIn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use climbed dramatically , and they are now prescribed to one in six of the adult population in England , for example .\nFor a long time , certain academics , including some leading psychiatrists , have suggested that there is no satisfactory evidence to support the idea that depression is a result of abnormally low or inactive serotonin .\nOthers continue to endorse the theory .\nUntil now , however , there has been no comprehensive review of the research on serotonin and depression that could enable firm conclusions either way .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ SSRI-type antidepressants act on the serotonin system appears to support the serotonin theory of depression .\nSSRIs temporarily increase the availability of serotonin in the brain , but this does not necessarily imply that depression is caused by the opposite of this effect .\nThere are other explanations for antidepressants \u2019 effects .\nIn fact , drug trials show that antidepressants are barely distinguishable from a placebo ( dummy pill ) when it comes to treating depression .\nAlso , antidepressants appear to have a generalised emotion-numbing effect which may influence people \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how this effect is produced or much about it .\nThere has been extensive research on the serotonin system since the 1990s , but it has not been collected systematically before .\nWe conducted an \u201c umbrella \u201d review that involved systematically identifying and collating existing overviews of the evidence from each of the main areas of research into serotonin and depression .\nAlthough there have been systematic reviews of individual areas in the past , none have combined the evidence from all the different areas taking this approach .\nOne area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels of serotonin and its breakdown products in the blood or brain fluid .\nOverall , this research did not show a difference between people with depression and those without depression .\nAnother area of research has focused on serotonin receptors , which are proteins on the ends of the nerves that serotonin links up with and which can transmit or inhibit serotonin \u2019 s effects .\nResearch on the most commonly investigated serotonin receptor suggested either no difference between people with depression and people without depression , or that serotonin activity was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite of the serotonin theory \u2019 s prediction .\nResearch on the serotonin \u201c transporter \u201d , that is the protein which helps to terminate the effect of serotonin ( this is the protein that SSRIs act on ) , also suggested that , if anything , there was increased serotonin activity in people with depression .\nHowever , these findings may be explained by the fact that many participants in these studies had used or were currently using antidepressants .\nWe also looked at research that explored whether depression can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of serotonin .\nTwo systematic reviews from 2006 and 2007 and a sample of the ten most recent studies ( at the time the current research was conducted ) found that lowering serotonin did not produce depression in hundreds of healthy volunteers .\nOne of the reviews showed very weak evidence of an effect in a small subgroup of people with a family history of depression , but this only involved 75 participants .\nVery large studies involving tens of thousands of patients looked at gene variation , including the gene that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey found no difference in the frequency of varieties of this gene between people with depression and healthy controls .\nAlthough a famous early study found a relationship between the serotonin transporter gene and stressful life events , larger , more comprehensive studies suggest no such relationship exists .\nStressful life events in themselves , however , exerted a strong effect on people \u2019 s subsequent risk of developing depression .\nSome of the studies in our overview that included people who were taking or had previously taken antidepressants showed evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity of serotonin .\nNot supported by the evidence The serotonin theory of depression has been one of the most influential and extensively researched biological theories of the origins of depression .\nOur study shows that this view is not supported by scientific evidence .\nIt also calls into question the basis for the use of antidepressants .\nMost antidepressants now in use are presumed to act via their effects on serotonin .\nSome also affect the brain chemical noradrenaline .\nBut experts agree that the evidence for the involvement of noradrenaline in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere is no other accepted pharmacological mechanism for how antidepressants might affect depression .\nIf antidepressants exert their effects as placebos , or by numbing emotions , then it is not clear that they do more good than harm .\nAlthough viewing depression as a biological disorder may seem like it would reduce stigma , in fact , research has shown the opposite , and also that people who believe their own depression is due to a chemical imbalance are more pessimistic about their chances of recovery .\nIt is important that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results from a \u201c chemical imbalance \u201d is hypothetical .\nAnd we do not understand what temporarily elevating serotonin or other biochemical changes produced by antidepressants do to the brain .\nWe conclude that it is impossible to say that taking SSRI

learn during the first few weeks of life .\nBut babies actually start processing language and speech incredibly early .\nEven while in the womb , they learn to discern voices , along with some speech sounds .\nAt birth , they already prefer speech sounds over other types of non-language sounds .\nBut exactly how the baby brain learns to process complex language sounds is still a bit of a mystery .\nIn our recent study , published in Nature Human Behaviour , we uncovered details of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first few hours of birth .\nWe collaborated with a neonatal research team in China , who fitted babies \u2019 heads with a small cap covered in sophisticated light emitting devices designed to measure tiny changes in oxygen levels in the babies \u2019 brains .\nDetectors in the cap could help us determine which areas of the brain were active over time .\nThe procedure , which is entirely safe and painless , was carried out within three hours of the babies being born .\nIt only required the baby to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shine minute infrared lights ( essentially heat radiation ) through the head .\nThis fits with the common practice in many cultures to wrap newborns in a close-fitting blanket to pacify them \u2013 easing the transition from the comfort of the womb to the wild world of autonomous physical existence .\nWithin three hours of being born , all babies were exposed to pairs of sounds that most researchers would predict they should be able to distinguish .\nThis included vowels ( such as \u201c o \u201d ) and these same vowels played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very different from normal ( forward ) speech , but in the case of isolated vowels , the difference is subtle .\nIn fact , in our study , we found that adult listeners could only distinguish between the two instances 70 % of the time .\nWhat surprised us is that newborns failed to differentiate between forwards and backwards vowels immediately after birth , because we found no difference between brain signals collected in each case in the first three hours of birth .\nIn hindsight , we should not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was .\nHowever , we were stunned to discover that after listening to these sounds for five hours , newborns started differentiating between these forwards and backwards vowels .\nFirst , their response to forwards vowels became faster than to backwards vowels .\nAnd after a further two hours , during which they mostly slept , their brain responded to forwards vowels not only faster but also more strongly compared with babies trained with different vowels or babies who remained in silence .\nThis means that in the first day of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby \u2019 s brain to learn the subtle difference between natural and slightly unnatural speech sounds .\nWe were further able to see that brain regions of the superior temporal lobe ( a part of the brain associated with auditory processing ) and of the frontal cortex ( involved in planning complex

.\nAnd even more fascinating , we were able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain areas ) between these regions in both the group of baby participants that were exposed to speech sounds , but not in those who had not experienced any training .\nIn other words , neurons of the trained babies were having a \u201c conversation \u201d across the brain in a way that was not seen in babies who remained in silence during the same period .\nNewborns probably benefit directly from being talked to from the very first moments they have left the womb .\nClearly , \u201c nurture \u201d \u2013 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 starts on day one .\nWe can also consider these findings in the context of a trendy concept in neuroscience today , namely embodiment theory .\nEmbodiment is the idea that our thoughts and mental operations

out , the page was found soon .\nThis was simply mailed as an attachment to an individual who had been interested in writing articles pertaining to the Gateway Report for quite some time now .\nThe Gateway Report- An Entry Into Astral Projection This declassified information from the CIA talks about Simulation theory .\nThe Gateway Report was created by Itzhak Bentov , an Israeli- American engineer in biomedicine all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also took in the services of Colonel Wayne M. McDonnell , a Lieutenant in the US Army .\nIn 2003 , this 28-page report was finally declassified by the CIA .\nWhile the document was released for everyone to peruse , the crucial page number 25 went missing- inciting a mass hunt for the paper .\nNow , for those who are not really aware of what astral projection is , this is often considered to be one of those \u2018 out-of-body experiences .\nIn these experiences , individuals \u201c astrally project \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they often can observe their body from the outside for example .\nWhat this implies is that we would be able to cross the space-time continuum with our consciousness into higher dimensions \u2013 while our physical form would still be on the Earthly plane .\nSome people who believe in the Simulation Theory consider the very notion of astral projection to be a form of simulation .\nThey believe that the unique feeling we get sometimes could be our residue from a different reality altogether .\nThis implies that our experiences and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our unconscious with memories of other places and times .\nIn this report from the CIA , Lt. McDonnell stated that his main goal was creating a valid and accurate model that would bring out the utility of the consciousness- while removing the prejudice and stigma that are usually associated with most out-of-body experiences .\nAccording to McDonnell , there could have been some practical applications for this particular practice- but this hasn \u2019 t been seen or recognized yet .\nWhy Was The 25th Page So Important ?\nIn The Gateway Report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with it- especially if the military were to attempt it .\nOne of the dangers associated with it would be the risk of encountering higher dimensional beings when one crossed the space-time barrier , turning humanity into coherent and non-corporeal forms of energy .\nThe US Army , therefore , decided to follow through on the remote viewing missions by having the soldiers train their psychic abilities which could them a potential advantage on the battlefield .\nFor anyone wanting to read the Gateway Report , it is quite a labyrinth that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with a dash of spirituality .\nFor close to 24 pages , the author speaks about several frames of reference which are transcendental meditation , hypnosis , spiritual systems for belief , quantum physics , biofeedback , and universal holograms .\nOn page 24 , one can almost taste the epiphany that McDonnell is experiencing as he writes of a full existential crescendo- only for it to reach page 26 .\nAfter speaking at length about the frames of reference that could help reveal the secrets of the higher dimensions , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he speaks about a set of \u201c Motivational Aspects \u201d .\nAfter all , there would have to be a legitimate reason behind the CIA employing this procedure as opposed to several other ways of reaching astral projection .\nWhat Exactly Is In That Page ?\nHere is the missing page : The 25th page of the Gateway Report opens up with the word \u2018 Absolute \u2019 .\nWhile there could be several interpretive explanations as to why this particular word , one can \u2019 t deny that it did set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting authoritatively- governing the entire page henceforth .\nIf one were to look at this word from a broader perspective , this term could definitely be applied to quantum physics as well as a spiritual belief system .\nNevertheless , the term \u2018 absolute \u2019 , is absolutely necessary and important .\nAs this report claims , the Absolute is absolutely important as the governing energy of the entire Universe .\nFor Lt. McDonnell , it was the powerhouse behind the universal hologram that was present for all eternity .\nThis report also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hologram or the cosmic egg as nothing more than a constantly flowing spiral that is quite huge in stature .\nBefore it was found out , page 25 of the Gateway Report was similar to a CODEX of the ancient ages .\nThere were quite a few FOIA requests that had been filed looking for the release of this page .\nIn every single instance , the CIA completely denounced that they even had it in the first place .\nThis led to a rise of government transparency activists , conspiracy theorists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the entire report and were quite irritated with the missing piece of the puzzle .\nOne theory on the Internet that gained some major traction was that Lt. McDonnell had himself erased that page .\nSo if one did project themselves astrally , they should be able to tell him what was there on it .\nOne might have to step a little into physics here- as physicists define time as the very measurement of energy that is constantly in motion .\nIn this particular way , the motion to occur should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOne can also find the framework solely limited- which is also contained at a highly specific location .\nThis confinement does make it quite distinguishable from any other spatial location in outer space .\nFor those wondering , any force which doesn \u2019 t seem to have a limit is always uncontained energy .\nOne simply needs to imagine entirely formless energy that is speeding through one \u2019 s Galaxy without any friction to take care of it .\nAnd since there is no particular location to pinpoint the existence of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is the \u201c Absolute \u201d .\nThe concept of the spiral , according to McDonnell , is present in most religions throughout the world .\nHe also goes on to cite the many examples of the Holy Spirit of Christianity , the labyrinth in the Hellenic world , the Tree of Life in Hebrew , and the Spiral through the Four Powers in Chinese culture .\nIt wouldn \u2019 t go amiss to state that most of the systems around the world have picked up on this form of thinking throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to focus on between religion and physics , is how this particular conclusion was reached .\nThe breakthroughs in Physics and the theologies of religious thinkers when it came to the Absolute are what differentiate the two streams of thought .\nWhereas physics- being a science- deals with quantitative research , religion moves towards intuition .\nThe last point that this particular page brings out is quite a slant toward the adherents of modern psychology .\nThe Absolute- which is also the Universe , is simply unreachable and irrelevant- unless we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out .\nThe Gateway Report Was More Than A CIA Experiment The Gateway Report wasn \u2019 t just the intellectual property of the CIA , as it leaned heavily on the teachings of Robert Monroe- the founder of the \u2018 Monroe Institute \u2019 .\nThis information seems even more vital when we realize that the Institute had the 25th page with them all this time .\nPeople had been clamoring for the CIA to bring

without the rest of the material ?\nAs it turns out , the Monroe Institute didn \u2019 t want to part with the missing page of the Gateway Report because they had some form of leverage .\nThey wanted to capitalize on the gains from this mission information .\nBut later , they decided to send it in after having a major shakedown in the hierarchical structure- with both the COO and the CEO being fired from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jargon , and perhaps it is just the talk of a crazy person .\nOr maybe , we know too little to understand what the author is actually talking about .\nHowever , why was it

neuroanatomist , reported \u201c a peculiar severe disease process of the cerebral cortex \u201d to a gathering of psychiatrists in T\u00fcbingen , Germany .\nThe case was a 50-year-old woman who suffered from memory loss , delusions , hallucinations , aggression and confusion \u2013 all of which worsened until her untimely death five years later .\nIn the autopsy , Alzheimer noticed distinctive plaques on her brain .\nThese plaques \u2013 clumps of amyloid-beta protein \u2013 are still considered to be the cause of Alzheimer \u2019 s disease .\nHowever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , it does not explain why many subjects ( even old people ) have plaques in their brains in the absence of any neurological symptoms , such as memory loss .\nSecond , clinical trials for drugs that reduce these plaques have been unsuccessful \u2013 with one recent exception , but more of that later .\nWhen amyloid-beta protein accumulates in the form of plaques ( insoluble clumps ) , the original soluble form of the protein , which performs important functions in the brain , is consumed and lost .\nSome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soluble amyloid-beta \u2013 called amyloid-beta 42 \u2013 have led to patients having worse clinical outcomes .\nIn a recent study , published in the Journal of Alzheimer \u2019 s Disease , we investigated whether it \u2019 s the amount of plaques in the brain or the amount of amyloid-beta 42 remaining that is more important for Alzheimer \u2019 s disease progression .\nTo answer this question , we studied data on a group of people who have a rare inherited gene mutation that puts them at high risk of developing Alzheimer \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network cohort study .\nWe found that the depletion of amyloid-beta 42 ( the functional version of amyloid-beta ) is more harmful than the amount of plaques ( the insoluble clumps of amyloid beta ) .\nParticipants had an average of three years follow-up and we found that those with high levels of amyloid-beta 42 in their cerebrospinal fluid ( the liquid around the brain and spinal cord ) were protected and their cognition was preserved over the study period .\nThis chimes with many studies that showed important functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt is also relevant because we studied people with the genetic mutation who develop Alzheimer \u2019 s disease , a group that is considered to provide the strongest evidence supporting the idea that amyloid-beta plaques are harmful .\nHowever , even in this group , those with higher cerebronspinal fluid ( CSF ) levels of amyloid-beta 42 remained cognitively normal regardless of the amount of plaques in their brains .\nIt is also worth mentioning that in some rare , inherited forms of Alzheimer \u2019 s disease \u2013 for example , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Arctic mutation \u2013 people can develop dementia having low levels of amyloid-beta 42 and no detectable plaques .\nThis suggests that plaques aren \u2019 t the cause of their dementia , but low levels of amyloid-beta 42 might be .\nHow will our findings affect drug development and clinical trials for Alzheimer \u2019 s disease ?\nUntil the recent trial with lecanemab , an antibody drug that reduces plaques , all the drug trials in Alzheimer \u2019 s disease have failed .\nSome drugs were designed to reduce the levels of amyloid-beta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if levels of the normal protein are reduced , patients will accumulate fewer plaques .\nUnfortunately , these drugs often made the patient \u2019 s condition worse .\nLecanemab was recently reported to have a small but significant effect in reducing cognitive decline .\nAccording to previous studies , this drug increases the levels of amyloid-beta 42 in the CSF .\nThis is , again , in line with our hypothesis , namely that the increase of the normal amyloid protein can be beneficial .\nWe will know more when the results of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment , all we have is a press release from the makers of the drug .\nWe think that it will be important for future trials to focus on the levels of amyloid-beta 42 , and whether it is beneficial to increase and restore its levels to normal values instead of targeting it for removal .\nThis could be achieved using proteins similar to amyloid-beta 42 \u2013 so-called \u201c protein analogues \u201d \u2013 but that clump together less than the natural

@ @ @ @ @ several groups all over the world for the last few centuries .\nIn the United States , the biggest sub-genre of this therapy would be music therapy , but other factions have risen up as well .\nAfter all , music and sound are quite simple to access and are noninvasive as well .\nOne should also realize that sound therapy is quite distinct inside itself- as there are various flavors of sounds that affect differently .\nEvery single note has its own healing capacity .\nAnd due to this , sound baths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author of Sound Bath : Meditate , Heal , and Connect Through Listening , Sara Auster , uses sound baths to initiate a full-body , immersive listening experience .\nMusic therapy , on its own , uses sounds that are guided by a therapist in order to alleviate stress and enhance one \u2019 s memory .\nAnother form of this therapy is binaural beats , which involves playing a couple of separate tones in each ear which are then perceived as a single tone by the brain .\nIncidentally , sound therapy finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPythagoras , the ancient Greek mathematician and philosopher , was one of the first to use therapeutic sound bites to diagnose and treat emotional , as well as physical maladies .\nIamblichus , his biographer , wrote that the scientist believed that music had the ability to contribute greatly to one \u2019 s health .\nIf it was used in

taken the opportunity to travel more .\nOthers might have envisioned that they would be further along in their careers or personal relationships .\nIn reality , life is hard and we might face setbacks ( big and small ) that can shatter our dreams , leaving us with fragments we perceive as worthless .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Conversation , narrated by Noa , here .\nFeelings of failure can take a long-lasting mental toll but they don \u2019 t have to stop you in your tracks .\nThere are many teachings , practices and philosophies that can help you deal with disappointment , embrace imperfection and remain optimistic .\nOne such practice is the Japanese art form of kintsugi , which means joining with gold .\nIt has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years as both an art technique , a worldview and metaphor for how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Japanese art have been influenced by Zen and Mahayana philosophies , which champion the concepts of acceptance and contemplation of imperfection , as well as the constant flux and impermanence of all things .\nThis article is part of Fail Better , a series for those of us in our 20s and 30s about navigating the moments when things aren \u2019 t quite going as planned .\nMany of us are tuned into the highlight reel of social media , where our peers share their successes in relationships , careers and family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re not measuring up , the pieces in this special Quarter Life series will help you learn how to cope with , and even grow from , failure .\nKintsugi is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery .\nIf a bowl is broken , rather than discarding the pieces , the fragments are put back together with a glue-like tree sap and the cracks are adorned with gold .\nThere are no attempts to hide the damage , instead , it is highlighted .\nThe practice has come to represent the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe breakage is an opportunity and applying this kind of thinking to instances of failure in our own lives can be helpful .\nKintsugi was fairly widespread in Japan around the late 16th and early 17th centuries .\nThe origins of this aesthetic go back hundreds of years to the Muromachi period ( approximately 1336 to 1573 ) .\nThe third ruling Shogun ( leader ) of that era , Ashikaga Yoshimitsu ( 1358-1408 ) , is said to have broken his favourite tea bowl .\nThe bowl was unique and could @ @

China as well as in parts of Europe at the time for particularly valuable pieces .\nHowever , the Shogun considered it to be neither functional nor beautiful .\nInstead , the Shogun had his own artisans resolve the situation by finding a method to make something beautiful from the broken , damaged object , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kintsugi came to be .\nKintsugi makes something new from a broken pot , which is transformed to possess a different sort of beauty .\nThe imperfection , the golden cracks , are what make the new object unique .\nThey are there every time you look at it and they welcome contemplation of the object \u2019 s past and of the moment of \u201c failure \u201d that it and its owner has overcome .\nThe art of kintsugi is inextricably linked to the Japanese philosophy of wabi-sabi : a worldview centred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the beauty found in simplicity .\nWabi-sabi is also an appreciation of both natural objects and the forces of nature that remind us that nothing stays the same forever .\nWabi-sabi can also be incorporated into contemplating something and seeing it grow more beautiful as time passes .\nAs a craft and an art form , kintsugi challenges expectations .\nThis is because the technique goes further than repairing an object but actually transforms and intentionally changes its appearance .\nIn an age of mass production and conformity , learning to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrates , can be powerful .\nWhether it \u2019 s reeling from a breakup or being turned down for a promotion , the fragments of our disappointment can be transformed into something new .\nThat new thing might not be perfect or be how you had envisioned it would be , but it is beautiful .\nRather than try to disguise the flaws , the kintsugi technique highlights and draws attention to them .\nThe philosophy of kintsugi , as an approach to life , can help encourage us when we face failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pieces , and if we manage to do that we can put them back together .\nThe result might not seem beautiful straight away but as wabi-sabi teaches , as time passes , we may be able to appreciate the beauty of those imperfections .\nThe bowl may seem broken , the pieces scattered , but this is an opportunity to put it back together with seams of gold .\nIt will be something new , unique and strong .\nQuarter Life is a series about issues

value .\nAnd one of them states that one should never insert their head in a particle accelerator- because that is assuredly fatal .\nNow- this should be just a cautionary tale- something to put fear in the minds of budding scientists .\nBut as it turns out , this isn \u2019 t just a caution- this is also a story of a time not too long ago when this turned into a horrific tragedy .\nAnyone who has ever worked in a science lab would tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one follows all the rules that are designed for one \u2019 s protection and safety .\nSo , if it is important to put glasses on before dealing with harmful gases or liquids , it is also important to not put your head in something as dangerous and unpredictable as a particle accelerator .\nThe basis for this is simple- you wouldn \u2019 t put your head before a cannon , right ?\nTherefore , why would someone put their head before something that can shoot atomic particles at the very speed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put His Head Into Particle Accelerator And Lived To Tell The Tale Unfortunately , Anatoli Bugorski of the erstwhile Soviet Union didn \u2019 t really follow through on the rules .\nSo one day when he was working , he probably listened to his intrusive thoughts and stuck his head in a particle accelerator .\nAnd what happened after that is something that has been considered to be a medical mystery .\nAnatoli was born on the 25th of June , 1942 , when the Second World War was at its peak .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found himself working as a researcher at the Institute for High Energy Physics .\nThis Insitute was located in Protvino .\nFrom being a newborn in a World War to playing quite a role in the Cold War , Anatoli definitely saw the world a bit differently .\nIn this institute , Anatoli was asked to work on the U-70 synchrotron- which is simply a proton accelerator .\nBack in the day , it was considered to generate the highest beam of energy in the world .\nEven today , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country .\nFortunately , ( or unfortunately ) , Anatoli became famous for a completely different role in this .\nWhile his peers would go on to attain fame as venerable scientists , Anatoli became famous for surviving a radiation accident that should have pulverized him into dust .\nOn the 13th of July , 1978 , the 36-year-old was tweaking the equipment when he inserted his head inside it to see where the problem lay .\nAs luck would have it , the safety mechanism was also turned off during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since then .\nSo when he put his head inside , the machine was still highly active .\nThis is when things got really tricky and dangerous .\nThe proton beam hit the back of the scientist \u2019 s head , and while he didn \u2019 t feel any pain- he knew something had gone terribly wrong .\nLater , he would talk about how he saw a flash of light that was brighter than a thousand suns .\nThe aftermath of this incident saw him quietly working on the machine even after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiation .\nRather than tell people about it , he went home to deal with the effects alone .\nMedical reports later stated that this proton beam had passed through his head and traveled along the temporal and occipital lobes of the brain .\nThe beam then moved through his middle ear- after which it exited his body through the left side of his nose .\nThe Radiation He Was Exposed To Should Have Ideally Killed Him Any individual with a working knowledge of basic biology would tell you that our ears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play in everyday human function .\nThe occipital lobe is especially more significant when we talk about visual processing .\nOn the other hand , the temporal lobe is that part of the brain which is entirely responsible for processing all of the sensory input for mass retention .\nSo when Anatoli put his head in a particle accelerator , the beam went through his middle ear- which is also called the tympanic cavity- which connects the brain to the Eustachian tube .\nThe main function of this part of the ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy into fluid-membrane waves present in the cochlea .\nAs we know , radiation usually causes most of the chemical bonds that are in control of the DNA to start breaking- and when there is enough radiation- it can also cause the cells to start losing the ability to duplicate .\nThe cells then start dying- which leads to organ failure .\nWhile it is quite surprising that Anatoli did escape with his life even after putting his head in a particle accelerator , it doesn \u2019 t mean that it didn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he suffered through this ordeal , the left part of his face had swollen beyond recognition , and most hospitals in Moscow stated that there was nothing to be done to cure this scientist .\nNevertheless , medical scientists and doctors kept him in the clinic because they wanted to study him after death because this was the first ever instance of a human sticking their head inside something so dangerous .\nOver the next couple of weeks , his skin started peeling- and doctors could see burnt portions of his brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the proton beam had passed through him .\nSurprisingly- he should have died , but he miraculously survived the entire incident .\nEven Though He Survived , He Still Had A Lot of Physical and Mental Trauma To Last A Lifetime The radiation did leave a lot of side effects- which also involved his facial nerves burning completely .\nThe left side of the scientist \u2019 s face was completely paralyzed- and his left ear lost all hearing .\nThis damage also caused the scientist to experience multiple seizures throughout his life- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange .\nIt was discovered that the left side of the face- the part which was paralyzed- was not aging .\nWhile the right side of his face aged naturally over the course of his life , the left side was in a state of stasis .\nNevertheless , this didn \u2019 t deter Anatoli from his experiments and research , as he completed his Ph.D. and also continued working at the same institute .\nAs was usual in the times of the Cold War , the secrecy that bound most information regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anatoli could not speak about it until the end of the Cold War .\nIn fact , it took him close to a decade to even start articulating his ordeal .\nBut , this didn \u2019 t stop the researchers from researching him as he had to regularly visit a radiation clinic that would be monitoring his condition .\nAt these clinics , he slowly started getting acquainted with other victims of nuclear accidents .\nWhen he started talking about the incidents to the media , he also stated that he considered himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inmates- as they had all the information about the other- and they were completely aware of what had happened to everyone else .\nSince there were not many victims of nuclear accidents- they knew everyone \u2019 s life stories .\nThe End of The Soviet Union Brought More Trouble At His Doorstep Fortunately , the tale of Anatoli Bugorski is not entirely tragic .\nThe man who put his head in a particle accelerator is still alive and recently celebrated his 80th birthday in 2022 .\nHe is also married with an adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Protvino , Russia .\nWhile he is fine with researchers still studying his conditions , they need to come to Protvino- as he doesn \u2019 t have the finances to leave the city and travel abroad .\nProtvino was one of those towns which experienced a boom during the Cold War as the USSR government decided to invest in this city for scientific and technological research .\nScientists and their families would be residing in these towns- which were a couple of hours away from the next big city .\nBut this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Read : WHY KIDS IN THE SOVIET UNION WOULD OFTEN SLEEP OUTSIDE IN FREEZING COLD ?\nWhen the Cold War ended in 1990 and the USSR collapsed in 1991 , these towns went through extreme financial crises as there was no government in place to fund them .\nScience towns like Protvino lacked the infrastructure where a scientist could successfully transform their career from a researcher to a banker- or any other profession which would give them a stable income .\nThese scientists also lived quite far away from any city that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t have the funds to relocate .\nThis is why Anatoli had to apply for disability status in 1996 to receive his medication for epilepsy for free .\nSurprisingly , he was denied- even though he was the poster child for Soviet radiation medicine .", "author": "Mayukh Saha", "url":

David Mech in 1970 .\nThis book helped the spread of the word , even though the author tried to explain that the term itself was outdated .\nFor over 30 years since then , Mech had been publishing a lot on the lifestyle of wolves , where he tried to fix the issue .\nHe stated that after spending a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island , he found out that the alpha pair were simply the parents of the entire pack .\nAt this point , it is important that one realizes that the research conducted prior to this discovery had captive wolves as the subject .\nNow , there is a huge difference between how an animal behaves in their natural surroundings , and how they end up in captivity .\nIt would be quite a big mistake to believe that the behavior will not change under such duress .\nDr. Mech also mentioned that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would leave their existing pack was to find members of the opposite sex to mate with and form new packs .\nOnce a wolf mates and bonds with another , it lasts until one of them die .\nThere is also little to no fighting between the male offspring and the father for the status of the alpha wolf .\nOn the other hand , Guardian did posit a theory regarding the similarity between alpha males in apes and humans- which was derived from Frans de Waal \u2019 s Chimpanzee Politics .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human behavior , and it became even more trendy when used to describe the presidential campaign of Al Gore .\nThe term became even more mainstream when Neil Strauss \u2019 s The Game promoted it as something men should aspire to be .\nThe book had lessons that the writer acquired from the Pick-Up Artist community .\nThis does bring up several dubious points- with the foremost being the skepticism that is associated with pick-up artists .\nAnd yet , with the idea of possible sex being quite a motivator , the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your life getting improved has seemed pretty beguiling to a large section of the population .\nThere Is No Concept Of A Universal Alpha Male In Humans The Guardian states , \u201c One reason that , despite a lack of concrete evidence , the idea of the human alpha male is so persuasive is that it makes a great deal of intuitive sense.\n\u201d We can all attest to the fact that there are big and loud guys all around us- and this just puts them in a label of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to deny that humans aren \u2019 t influenced by social dominance .\nAfter all , we do exist in multiple hierarchies- and almost all of them are unequal in nature .\nTherefore , the Guardian believes , it should not be this far-fetched for one to think that there are men who rise to the top of the totem pole based on certain psychological and physical qualities .\nTo Put It Succinctly , An Alpha Male Is Often A Bully Also , it shouldn \u2019 t be surprising for us that men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are supremely confident do appeal to certain sections of the population .\nBut this doesn \u2019 t justify their presence .\nFor- although there is a distinct similarity between humans and primates when it comes to this niche personality , the differences are far-reaching as well .\nHuman hierarchies are far more complex- and someone who is at the top of one hierarchy could be at the lowest rung of another .\nA universal alpha male is non-existent .\nAnother point of contention that supposed alpha males conveniently forget is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male in a community .\nAnd yet , social media is rife with groups where everyone considers themselves to be alpha males .\nLest it is forgotten , the idea of an alpha male also brings up the question of an alpha female .\nIn primates , the alpha female commands similar veins of respect and control .\nBut in humans , it is a foregone conclusion that in order to be an alpha male or a \u2018 bad boy \u2019 , one has to be less respectful towards women , something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the average alpha male , as described by Dean Burnett in his book The Idiot Brain , is someone who tries to get what he wants through displays of intimidation and some twisted pseudoscientific justification .\nThese tactics are utilized because they find the universal dynamics around themselves too complex- which lets them resort to their baser instincts .", "author": "Mayukh Saha", "url": "https://truththeory.com/is-the-term-alpha-male-actually-a-lie/", "published": "Thu, 15 Dec 2022 17:59:23 +0000", "published_utc": 1671145163, "collection_utc": 1671149626}]
