Daily ) We \u2019 re always hearing that we should eat more fiber .\nIt \u2019 s known to be vitally important for a healthy digestive system and also has cardiovascular benefits like reduced cholesterol .\nNow , evidence is emerging that fiber is also important for a healthy brain .\nIn a new study from the University of Tskuba , published in the journal Nutritional Neuroscience , shows researchers in Japan found that a high-fiber diet is associated with a reduced risk of developing dementia .\n\u201c Dementia is a devastating disease that usually requires long-term care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study Professor Kazumasa Yamagishi .\n\u201c We were interested in some recent research which suggested that dietary fiber may play a preventative role .\nWe investigated this using data that were collected from thousands of adults in Japan for a large study that started in the 1980s.\n\u201d Participants completed surveys that assessed their dietary intake between 1985 and 1999 .\nThey were generally healthy and aged between 40 and 64 years .\nThey were then followed up from 1999 until 2020 , and it was noted whether they developed dementia that required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from a total of 3739 adults , into four groups according to the amount of fiber in their diets .\nThey found that the groups who ate higher levels of fiber had a lower risk of developing dementia .\nThe team also examined whether there were differences for the two main types of fiber : soluble and insoluble fibers .\nSoluble fibers , found in foods such as oats and legumes , are important for the beneficial bacteria that live in the gut as well as providing other health benefits .\nInsoluble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables , and some other foods , are known to be important for bowel health .\nThe researchers found that the link between fiber intake and dementia was more pronounced for soluble fibers .\nThe team has some ideas as to what might underlie the link between dietary fiber and the risk of dementia .\n\u201c The mechanisms are currently unknown but might involve the interactions that take place between the gut and the brain , \u201d says Professor Yamagishi .\n\u201c One possibility is that soluble fiber regulates the composition of gut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which plays a role in the onset of dementia .\nIt \u2019 s also possible that dietary fiber may reduce other risk factors for dementia , such as body weight , blood pressure , lipids , and glucose levels .\nThe work is still at an early stage , and it \u2019 s important to confirm the association in other populations.\n\u201d In many countries today , such as the US and Australia , many people consume less fiber than is recommended by nutritionists .\nBy encouraging healthy eating habits with high @ @

elevate prolactin levels and can produce side effects such as menstrual cycle irregularities , abnormal breast milk production and abnormal breast tissue growth .\nThe researchers classified antipsychotic drugs into three categories , based on their established effects on prolactin .\nCategory 1 included drugs associated with high prolactin levels , such as haloperidol , paliperidone and

Healthcare Workers and Patients Hospital studies support daily mouth-washing and throat-gargling with 1 % hydrogen peroxide and 0.5 % for nasal cleansing ( July 08 , 2022 ) Dilute hydrogen peroxide has been demonstrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deactivating SARS-COV-2 variants and their subvariants .\nNo cases of COVID-19 were recorded after hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis was introduced .\nThere was not a single case of COVID-19 among a total of 10,220 inpatients on hydrogen peroxide between August 2020 and June 2022 .\nTo date , the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has affected 535 million people and claimed over 6.3 million lives globally .\n[ 1 ] New estimates from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) show that the full death toll associated directly or indirectly with the COVID-19 pandemic and described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 2020 and 31 December 2021 , is approximately 14.9 million , ranging from 13.3 million to 16.6 million .\n[ 2 ] The current pandemic , therefore , is the world \u2019 s worst catastrophic event since the Spanish pandemic influenza that resulted in at least 50 million deaths between 1918 and 1919 .\n[ 3 ] As of December 22nd 2020 when vaccinations against the disease had begun to be rolled out in Russia , China , the US and the UK , the estimated number of COVID-19 cases globally was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n[ 4 ] Since then , an estimated 11.8 billion doses of vaccines have been administered , with 4.7 billion people fully vaccinated .\n[ 5 ] In countries with more robust healthcare systems such as Israel , Denmark , Sweden and Norway , up to four booster doses of vaccines have been given to vulnerable groups in an effort to abate the severity of clinical outcomes of the disease from infections caused by the new and more virulent and transmissible variants of SARS-CoV-2 .\n[ 6 ] Established public health protocols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as nose and mouth coverings , use of alcohol-based sanitizers , frequent handwashing and safe distancing , have also been opted for in Ghana [ 7 ] , and most likely in many other countries over the first 24 months of the pandemic .\nDespite these interventions and the enforcement of standard public health preventive measures , the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase .\nSince November 2019 when the Wuhan strain of the virus first emerged , several variants of concern have also emerged .\n[ 8 ] The COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care and other societal systems , as well as the global economy .\nAs is the case in most humanitarian emergencies , the poorer developing nations have taken the hardest hits , and disadvantaged groups , particularly people living in poverty and subject to marginalization and exclusion , have suffered the most .\n[ 9 ] That is why the effort to identify more effective public health control measures must continue , with advocacy for trial use of oral and nasal antiseptics which include hydrogen peroxide , a known effective bactericidal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies have shown that 3 % hydrogen peroxide inactivates SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses .\n[ 12,13 ] Since the emergence of COVID-19 , additional studies have demonstrated that even lower concentrations of hydrogen peroxide ( 1 % and 0.5 % ) inactivate the virus within one minute in-vitro .\n[ 14-16 ] Povidone has also been shown in in-vitro studies to inactivate the virus .\nThese comparative in-vitro studies suggest that povidone and hydrogen peroxide are most effective against the virus when the virus is exposed to them .\n[ 15 ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oral antiseptics against SARS-CoV-2 , had been lacking until recently .\n[ 16-19 ] Oral antiseptics including hydrogen peroxide had not featured in the preventive measures against previous coronavirus infections such as the SARS-CoV and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) epidemics .\nIn this brief review , we have considered the scientific basis of the effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide antisepsis against SARS-CoV-2 , providing clinical evidence that this solution even in low concentrations protects against COVID-19 .\nEmphasis is being placed by researchers on oral antiseptics in the search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential of these solutions to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 .\nFrom the results of in-vitro studies as noted above , it had been rightly assumed that viruses in the oronasal cavities and their adjacent pharyngeal spaces could be inactivated before they attach to and penetrate the mucosal barriers in these regions to infect deeper lying cells to cause infection and disease .\nCritical in this consideration is the membrane wall of the virus and the spike proteins found on it .\nThis nature of the virus has recently been reviewed .\n[ 20-22 ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the oral antiseptic must affect either the membrane wall of the virus or its spike proteins to prevent the S-protein from binding to the human Angiotensin Converting enzyme ( h-ACE ) receptor which is present in the mucus membrane of all parts of the respiratory system .\n[ 21 ] That is how the antiseptic inactivates the virus to prevent it from attaching to the mucosa and to penetrate to infect deeper lying cells to cause infection .\nBeing a powerful oxidant , hydrogen peroxide has a great potential to achieve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ROS ) products of hydrogen peroxide rapidly modify the acyl chain by lipid peroxidation of the unsaturated chains in the membrane wall to destabilize the virus .\n[ 11,23 ] By that action , hydrogen peroxide directly limits and even destroys the ability of the virus to attach to ACE receptors .\nThe ROS also directly affect amino acid chains of proteins [ 24 ] , and would , therefore , interfere with the structure of the spike proteins of the virus in the process of peroxidation , rendering them ineffective .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Coronavirus Hydrogen peroxidation occurs within a minute .\nThe virus , therefore , has little chance of infecting an individual , as it requires at least 24 to 48 hours to attach to the mucous membrane and to penetrate to cause infection , the incubation period varying 2-14 days .\n[ 25,26 ] A window of opportunity of at least 24 hours is therefore offered to inactivate the virus soon after entering either the oral or nasal cavities .\nWithin a minute of that period and with concentrations of hydrogen peroxide as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the virus is inactivated as suggested in a recent study .\n[ 16 ] Even when a more transmissible variant or sub-variant of the virus enters the oronasal cavities , there is sufficient time for hydrogen peroxide deactivation to happen , if it is used daily .\nIt must be noted , however , that the virus could escape residence in the oral and nasal cavities and their pharyngeal spaces to directly affect other parts of the trachea-bronchial tree including the alveolar pneumocytes , causing early disease with dire consequences .\n[ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for early intervention with hydrogen peroxide nebulization is vital in such cases to inactivate the virus before it causes disease directly involving the alveoli .\nThis subject has been extensively dealt with .\n[ 28-30 ] For that reason , those at greater risk of direct invasion of the lungs with viruses such as healthcare workers , athletes , and those with lifestyle activities requiring hyperventilation , must also boost their immune system with adequate levels of micronutrients such as Vitamin C , D and E , folic acid , zinc , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Hydrogen Peroxide use in the Oronasal , and Oropharyngeal Cavities The rationale for topical use of hydrogen peroxide in the oral cavity is that the mucosa of the oral cavity and the oropharynx has a robust epithelium that is not easily corroded .\nThe stratified squamous keratinized and non-keratinized epithelial nature of the oral cavity and the oropharynx help to prevent damage .\nNoting that the reactive oxygen species generated by hydrogen peroxide has mutagenic properties , the epithelium of the oropharyngeal mucosae is even keratinized in some parts , [ 32 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutagenicity .\nThe nasal cavity and its postnasal space , on the other hand , present a challenge : the mucosa here is less robust , except in the nasal vestibule which has stratified squamous keratinized epithelium .\nThe mucosal lining of the main nasal cavity as well as the nasopharynx is pseudo-stratified columnar type of epithelium interspersed with mucus secreting goblet cells [ 32 ] , except in its roof including the adjacent surfaces of the superior conchae where olfactory epithelium exits .\nTo limit corrosion of these less robust types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower concentration of hydrogen peroxide ( 0.5 % ) has been recommended .\n[ 18,33 ] That is the reason why only 2-3 drops of the 0.5 % hydrogen solution per day are required and for a period of one minute .\nMutagenicity of Hydrogen Peroxide and other Adverse Effects We have referred to this already but must address it more fully , as it is of the utmost importance in any recommendation of hydrogen peroxide topical use .\nIn a publication in the British Medical Journal , we addressed that challenge [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive review on the subject by Walsh [ 34 ] and Marshall et.al .\n[ 35 ] So far , no evidence has been found in human studies of cellular mutation in oral use of hydrogen peroxide at concentrations of 3 % .\nEven hydrogen peroxide use at concentrations of 6 % for whitening of teeth has not shown any evidence of mutagenicity .\nIn their review of hydrogen peroxide safety , it was noted that some individuals had used hydrogen peroxide daily for 6 years without deleterious effects .\n[ 35 ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen peroxide is an essential product in the metabolism of innate immune cells to destroy pathogens through peroxidation .\nThe ROS released in that process are quickly detoxified to protect body cells by enzymes such as catalase , superoxide dismutase , and glutathione peroxidase .\n[ 36 ] Saliva has been found to contain peroxidase , catalase and glutathione reductase .\n[ 37 ] Any excess of hydrogen peroxide in the oral cavity and oropharynx would therefore be detoxified by these enzymes in saliva .\nAccidental swallowing of 3 % hydrogen peroxide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritation in some individuals .\nIn the two-year period of study of hydrogen peroxide use to prevent COVID-19 , our attention has not been drawn to any such deleterious effect in those using the hydrogen peroxide solution .\nProphylactic Use of Oral Antiseptics in Dental Practice to Protect Patients and Staff from COVID-19 Recent data on the use of hydrogen peroxide in dental clinics suggests that it is useful in reducing SARS-CoV-2 viral load [ 16 ] , corroborating the use of oral antiseptics employed in dental practice as an antidote to SARS-CoV-2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US especially , hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis in dental surgery has been adopted by the American Dental Association .\n[ 38 ] In New Zealand , hydrogen peroxide use as prophylaxis has also been approved .\n[ 39 ] In Ghana , both povidone and hydrogen peroxide are in use clinically for patients before non-surgical and surgical dental procedures ( Personal communication \u2013 Dr. Mary Ayettey-Adamafio , co-author ) .\nThis practice is intended to protect both patients and staff from contracting the coronavirus .\nIt is helpful too for the patient , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might otherwise escape into the blood stream to cause disease .\n[ 4 ] Clinical Use of Hydrogen Peroxide to Protect Healthcare Workers and Patients This is the crux of our current research published to date .\n[ 17,18 ] From our observations that very low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide protect hospital staff who are most at risk of contracting COVID-19 , from the strong anecdotal evidence of hydrogen peroxide protection from the disease , and from the growing international interest in the use of oral antiseptics to prevent the disease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 to investigate the relationship between hydrogen peroxide and coronaviruses .\nIndeed , since then , other investigators have also shared anecdotal evidence of hydrogen peroxide benefits even in treatment of COVID-19 .\n[ 28,30 ] While preparing a protocol for clinical investigation of the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide protection against COVID-19 , we were fortuitously presented with an opportunity to observe eight emergency care nurses at the Shai-Osudoku District Hospital who , on their own volition , had been using hydrogen peroxide since May 2020 to protect themselves from the disease .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ protocols were the established public health measures including mouth and nose covers , frequent washing of hands with soap under running water , and use of hand sanitizers .\nOnly those who were managing confirmed COVID-19 cases wore the full personal protective equipment clothing suit .\nThese emergency-care nurses wore ordinary scrubs ; there were no vaccines available at the time ; neither were there fail-proof therapeutic remedies for the disease .\nUnknown to us , these eight healthcare workers had heard about our advocacy for 1 % hydrogen peroxide daily use for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.5 % for nasal cleansing through several social platforms to save lives , and were using it .\nThe reason for promoting hydrogen peroxide use was that team members and their relatives using the solution and who had been exposed to the disease had been protected .\nBy May 2020 , anecdotal evidence of hydrogen peroxide protection against COVID-19 had already become strong .\nFaced with the real challenge of rapid spreading of the disease , and without fail-proof preventive measures and therapeutic interventions , we were obliged to share more widely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wider family , friends , colleagues , neighbors and others including religious bodies , recognizing also that this antiseptic is an off-the-counter solution that had been in use in dental practice for decades .\n[ 35 ] It was observed that these eight nurses remained free of COVID-19 , even though they attended to several patients at the facility who were later diagnosed with COVID-19 .\nRT-PCR tests on them remained negative .\nWe followed them closely till December 2020 .\nWhile they remained free of the disease , 62 of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital and clothed in scrubs like those at the emergency department but not using hydrogen peroxide , had COVID-19 by the end of December 2020 .\nBetween December 2020 and January 2021 , Ghana recorded two new variants of SARS-CoV-2 ( the Alpha and Beta variants ) which caused a spike in COVID-19 cases till March 2021 .\n[ 40 ] Realizing that their eight colleagues who managed patients , before they were diagnosed as COVID-19 and transferred to COVID-19 treatment centers , remained protected from the disease because they were using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hospital decided to try it .\nFrom January to end of March 2021 , none of these 86 healthcare workers now using hydrogen peroxide plus the 8 emergency nurses contracted COVID-19 , while 10 of their colleagues not using hydrogen peroxide had the disease .\nNew information from the Shai-Osudoku District Hospital reveals that there were 21 new cases of COVID-19 recorded among the healthcare staff in June 2022 .\nPrior to that , no new cases of COVID-19 were recorded since January 2022 .\nAll the twenty-one ( 21 ) affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using hydrogen peroxide .\nAt the Mount Olives Hospital which is a private facility in the Bono East Region of Ghana , another opportunity presented for observation of hydrogen peroxide protection against COVID-19 .\nTwenty-two ( 22 ) cases of COVID-19 were recorded at this hospital for the first time in July 2020 and before hydrogen peroxide intervention .\nSeventeen ( 17 ) of these were healthcare workers , and five ( 5 ) were inpatients .\nHydrogen peroxide prophylactic use among inpatients and staff was introduced in August 2020 .\nHydrogen peroxide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff on voluntary basis .\nBetween August 2020 and March 2021 , no cases of COVID-19 were recorded among a total of 3,375 inpatients on hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis twice a day .\nOf the members of staff , no cases of COVID-19 were recorded among those ( 32 ) not using hydrogen peroxide .\nOf the 52 on hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis , two travelled outside the town for a week and did not use hydrogen peroxide during that period ; those two contracted COVID-19 .\nThe rest were free from disease .\nFrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of COVID-19 were recorded among inpatients ( total 4726 ) .\nWithin the same period too , no cases of the disease were found among the healthcare staff , all of whom were fully vaccinated and using hydrogen peroxide , except one who stopped using hydrogen peroxide in the month of December and contracted the disease .\nAgain , this has been captured in our recent publications .\n[ 18 ] Recent information from this hospital is that no cases of COVID-19 have been recorded among healthcare workers and inpatients from January to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current total 89 ) , and all inpatients ( total 2,484 for the period ) have continued on hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis , the staff remaining fully vaccinated .\nA summary of the observations so far is that none at both institutions using hydrogen peroxide on a regular daily basis had COVID-19 over a period of 26 months since the study began .\nAt the Mount Olives Hospital , three staff members who stopped or interrupted hydrogen peroxide use over the period of the study had COVID-19 .\nOtherwise , no cases of COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced .\nThere was not a single case of COVID-19 among a total of 10,220 inpatients on hydrogen peroxide between August 2020 and June 2022 .\nThat the 32 members of healthcare staff at the Mount Olives Hospital who in the first phase of the study ( between August 2020 and March 2021 ) did not use hydrogen peroxide and yet remained free of COVID-19 is not entirely surprising .\nThey most likely were protected by the large number of staff and patients using hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis , even though they could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community .\nThat observation may indicate that hydrogen peroxide antiseptics curtails nosocomial spread SARS-CoV-2 .\nAn important observation which must not be overlooked is that within the period of the study ( May 2020 to June 2022 ) , the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 and all its variants and subvariants ( especially of the Omicron type ) of concern were encountered .\n[ 40,41 ] None of them , however , caused disease in healthcare workers or inpatients on hydrogen peroxide antisepsis .\nThis suggests that hydrogen peroxide has been effective in preventing COVID-19 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subvariants of concern encountered so far .\nBy its mechanism of action which has already been referred to , hydrogen peroxide would , in all likelihood , therefore , prevent disease by other viral variants of concern that might emerge .\nWe have also argued that if hydrogen peroxide protects individuals from being infected with the virus , it would also protect COVID-19 patients from infecting others , should these patients use it regularly .\n[ 18 ] Clinical studies should be conducted to establish that convincingly .\nBy that same logic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those with \u2018 long COVID \u2019 and those convalescing from the disease , could be expected to protect such patients from being reinfected with the viruses they are shedding .\nIn the current study , our attention was drawn to three individuals who became re-infected and had the disease within a period of three months of the first infections .\nLikely , this

easily transmitted and spreading rapidly in many parts of the West and elsewhere .\nPrevious infection and/or immunizations , including boosters , are reportedly less effective in preventing BA.5 than earlier variants .\n( See here . )\nWhile basic CDC recommendations used during the height of the pandemic have not changed , and vaccines are still reported to help prevent severe disease , the scientific community is examining the current situation for updated guidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popped into my inbox several days ago from the Orthomolecular Society .\nFounded in the 70s , this nonprofit shares health-related press releases through the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service .\nThe report I received highlights evidence systematically collected by medical practitioners in Ghana for thousands of patients and some front-line staff .\nThe proposed concept is that hydrogen peroxide\u2014used in a very low , safe dilution\u2014can deactivate the virus in the mouth and nose , thereby preventing infection .\n( Shai-Osudoku District Hospital , one of the participating facilities , is shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covid-19 did not spare Ghana ( World Health Organization report ) and the results reported here are remarkable .\nThere was surely no conflict of interest by the authors , as hydrogen peroxide is easy to obtain and costs less than 20 cents an ounce .\nThe simple approach presented is being shared for informational purposes and is not a formal recommendation .\nI \u2019 m headed to Boston next week , where a current spike in BA.5 cases is widely reported .\nAlthough vaccinated and single boosted , I \u2019 m going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also masking up in public indoor settings .\nThe protocol for oral and nasal protection with hydrogen peroxide will be posted on our site soon .\nThe journal report below is comprehensive , and some readers may want to skip past the compelling technical justification for use of hydrogen peroxide and focus on the subtitle Clinical Use of Hydrogen Peroxide to Protect Healthcare Workers and Patients for an explanation of study results .\nHospital studies support daily mouth-washing and throat-gargling with 1 % hydrogen peroxide and 0.5 % for nasal cleansing ( July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been demonstrated to be effective in preventing COVID-19 , deactivating SARS-COV-2 variants and their subvariants .\nNo cases of COVID-19 were recorded after hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis was introduced .\nThere was not a single case of COVID-19 among a total of 10,220 inpatients on hydrogen peroxide between August 2020 and June 2022 .\nTo date , the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has affected 535 million people and claimed over 6.3 million lives globally .\n[ 1 ] New estimates from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) show that the full death toll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic and described as \u201c excess mortality \u201d between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2021 , is approximately 14.9 million , ranging from 13.3 million to 16.6 million .\n[ 2 ] The current pandemic , therefore , is the world \u2019 s worst catastrophic event since the Spanish pandemic influenza that resulted in at least 50 million deaths between 1918 and 1919 .\n[ 3 ] As of December 22nd 2020 when vaccinations against the disease had begun to be rolled out in Russia , China , the US and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases globally was 75 million , with 1.6 million deaths .\n[ 4 ] Since then , an estimated 11.8 billion doses of vaccines have been administered , with 4.7 billion people fully vaccinated .\n[ 5 ] In countries with more robust healthcare systems such as Israel , Denmark , Sweden and Norway , up to four booster doses of vaccines have been given to vulnerable groups in an effort to abate the severity of clinical outcomes of the disease from infections caused by the new and more virulent and transmissible variants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public health protocols to prevent spread of the disease , such as nose and mouth coverings , use of alcohol-based sanitizers , frequent handwashing and safe distancing , have also been opted for in Ghana [ 7 ] , and most likely in many other countries over the first 24 months of the pandemic .\nDespite these interventions and the enforcement of standard public health preventive measures , the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase .\nSince November 2019 when the Wuhan strain of the virus first emerged , several variants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have profound effects on health care and other societal systems , as well as the global economy .\nAs is the case in most humanitarian emergencies , the poorer developing nations have taken the hardest hits , and disadvantaged groups , particularly people living in poverty and subject to marginalization and exclusion , have suffered the most .\n[ 9 ] That is why the effort to identify more effective public health control measures must continue , with advocacy for trial use of oral and nasal antiseptics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective bactericidal and fungicidal agent .\n[ 10,11 ] In-vitro studies have shown that 3 % hydrogen peroxide inactivates SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses .\n[ 12,13 ] Since the emergence of COVID-19 , additional studies have demonstrated that even lower concentrations of hydrogen peroxide ( 1 % and 0.5 % ) inactivate the virus within one minute in-vitro .\n[ 14-16 ] Povidone has also been shown in in-vitro studies to inactivate the virus .\nThese comparative in-vitro studies suggest that povidone and hydrogen peroxide are most effective against the virus when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ 15 ] Clinical evidence of efficacy and safety of oral antiseptics against SARS-CoV-2 , had been lacking until recently .\n[ 16-19 ] Oral antiseptics including hydrogen peroxide had not featured in the preventive measures against previous coronavirus infections such as the SARS-CoV and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) epidemics .\nIn this brief review , we have considered the scientific basis of the effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide antisepsis against SARS-CoV-2 , providing clinical evidence that this solution even in low concentrations protects against COVID-19 .\nEmphasis is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the search for a solution to prevent COVID-19 because of the potential of these solutions to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 .\nFrom the results of in-vitro studies as noted above , it had been rightly assumed that viruses in the oronasal cavities and their adjacent pharyngeal spaces could be inactivated before they attach to and penetrate the mucosal barriers in these regions to infect deeper lying cells to cause infection and disease .\nCritical in this consideration is the membrane wall of the virus and the spike proteins found on it .\nThis nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ 20-22 ] To be effective against an enveloped virus , the oral antiseptic must affect either the membrane wall of the virus or its spike proteins to prevent the S-protein from binding to the human Angiotensin Converting enzyme ( h-ACE ) receptor which is present in the mucus membrane of all parts of the respiratory system .\n[ 21 ] That is how the antiseptic inactivates the virus to prevent it from attaching to the mucosa and to penetrate to infect deeper lying cells to cause infection .\nBeing a powerful oxidant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve the above .\nThe released reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) products of hydrogen peroxide rapidly modify the acyl chain by lipid peroxidation of the unsaturated chains in the membrane wall to destabilize the virus .\n[ 11,23 ] By that action , hydrogen peroxide directly limits and even destroys the ability of the virus to attach to ACE receptors .\nThe ROS also directly affect amino acid chains of proteins [ 24 ] , and would , therefore , interfere with the structure of the spike proteins of the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ineffective .\nOral antiseptics and the Incubation Period of the Coronavirus Even when a more transmissible variant or sub-variant of the virus enters the oronasal cavities , there is sufficient time for hydrogen peroxide deactivation to happen , if it is used daily .\nIt must be noted , however , that the virus could escape residence in the oral and nasal cavities and their pharyngeal spaces to directly affect other parts of the trachea-bronchial tree including the alveolar pneumocytes , causing early disease with dire consequences .\n[ 27 ] This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hydrogen peroxide nebulization is vital in such cases to inactivate the virus before it causes disease directly involving the alveoli .\nThis subject has been extensively dealt with .\n[ 28-30 ] For that reason , those at greater risk of direct invasion of the lungs with viruses such as healthcare workers , athletes , and those with lifestyle activities requiring hyperventilation , must also boost their immune system with adequate levels of micronutrients such as Vitamin C , D and E , folic acid , zinc , and magnesium .\n[ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in the Oronasal , and Oropharyngeal Cavities The rationale for topical use of hydrogen peroxide in the oral cavity is that the mucosa of the oral cavity and the oropharynx has a robust epithelium that is not easily corroded .\nThe stratified squamous keratinized and non-keratinized epithelial nature of the oral cavity and the oropharynx help to prevent damage .\nNoting that the reactive oxygen species generated by hydrogen peroxide has mutagenic properties , the epithelium of the oropharyngeal mucosae is even keratinized in some parts , [ 32 ] making those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nasal cavity and its postnasal space , on the other hand , present a challenge : the mucosa here is less robust , except in the nasal vestibule which has stratified squamous keratinized epithelium .\nThe mucosal lining of the main nasal cavity as well as the nasopharynx is pseudo-stratified columnar type of epithelium interspersed with mucus secreting goblet cells [ 32 ] , except in its roof including the adjacent surfaces of the superior conchae where olfactory epithelium exits .\nTo limit corrosion of these less robust types of epithelia in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen peroxide ( 0.5 % ) has been recommended .\n[ 18,33 ] That is the reason why only 2-3 drops of the 0.5 % hydrogen solution per day are required and for a period of one minute .\nMutagenicity of Hydrogen Peroxide and other Adverse Effects We have referred to this already but must address it more fully , as it is of the utmost importance in any recommendation of hydrogen peroxide topical use .\nIn a publication in the British Medical Journal , we addressed that challenge [ 33 ] , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject by Walsh [ 34 ] and Marshall et.al .\n[ 35 ] So far , no evidence has been found in human studies of cellular mutation in oral use of hydrogen peroxide at concentrations of 3 % .\nEven hydrogen peroxide use at concentrations of 6 % for whitening of teeth has not shown any evidence of mutagenicity .\nIn their review of hydrogen peroxide safety , it was noted that some individuals had used hydrogen peroxide daily for 6 years without deleterious effects .\n[ 35 ] It is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an essential product in the metabolism of innate immune cells to destroy pathogens through peroxidation .\nThe ROS released in that process are quickly detoxified to protect body cells by enzymes such as catalase , superoxide dismutase , and glutathione peroxidase .\n[ 36 ] Saliva has been found to contain peroxidase , catalase and glutathione reductase .\n[ 37 ] Any excess of hydrogen peroxide in the oral cavity and oropharynx would therefore be detoxified by these enzymes in saliva .\nAccidental swallowing of 3 % hydrogen peroxide , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals .\nIn the two-year period of study of hydrogen peroxide use to prevent COVID-19 , our attention has not been drawn to any such deleterious effect in those using the hydrogen peroxide solution .\nProphylactic Use of Oral Antiseptics in Dental Practice to Protect Patients and Staff from COVID-19 Recent data on the use of hydrogen peroxide in dental clinics suggests that it is useful in reducing SARS-CoV-2 viral load [ 16 ] , corroborating the use of oral antiseptics employed in dental practice as an antidote to SARS-CoV-2 transmission .\n[ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hydrogen peroxide are in use clinically for patients before non-surgical and surgical dental procedures ( Personal communication \u2013 Dr. Mary Ayettey-Adamafio , co-author ) .\nThis practice is intended to protect both patients and staff from contracting the coronavirus .\nIt is helpful too for the patient , as the oral antiseptic inactivates other microbial organisms that might otherwise escape into the blood stream to cause disease .\n[ 4 ] Clinical Use of Hydrogen Peroxide to Protect Healthcare Workers and Patients This is the crux of our current research published to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observations that very low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide protect hospital staff who are most at risk of contracting COVID-19 , from the strong anecdotal evidence of hydrogen peroxide protection from the disease , and from the growing international interest in the use of oral antiseptics to prevent the disease , we recognize a providential guidance in March 2020 to investigate the relationship between hydrogen peroxide and coronaviruses .\nIndeed , since then , other investigators have also shared anecdotal evidence of hydrogen peroxide benefits even in treatment of COVID-19 .\n[ 28,30 ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide protection against COVID-19 , we were fortuitously presented with an opportunity to observe eight emergency care nurses at the Shai-Osudoku District Hospital who , on their own volition , had been using hydrogen peroxide since May 2020 to protect themselves from the disease .\nAt that time , the only preventive protocols were the established public health measures including mouth and nose covers , frequent washing of hands with soap under running water , and use of hand sanitizers .\nOnly those who were managing confirmed COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing suit .\nThese emergency-care nurses wore ordinary scrubs ; there were no vaccines available at the time ; neither were there fail-proof therapeutic remedies for the disease .\nUnknown to us , these eight healthcare workers had heard about our advocacy for 1 % hydrogen peroxide daily use for mouth-washing and throat-gargling for one minute and 0.5 % for nasal cleansing through several social platforms to save lives , and were using it .\nThe reason for promoting hydrogen peroxide use was that team members and their relatives using the solution and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been protected .\nBy May 2020 , anecdotal evidence of hydrogen peroxide protection against COVID-19 had already become strong .\nFaced with the real challenge of rapid spreading of the disease , and without fail-proof preventive measures and therapeutic interventions , we were obliged to share more widely the anecdotal evidence of hydrogen peroxide protection with the wider family , friends , colleagues , neighbors and others including religious bodies , recognizing also that this antiseptic is an off-the-counter solution that had been in use in dental practice for decades .\n[ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight nurses remained free of COVID-19 , even though they attended to several patients at the facility who were later diagnosed with COVID-19 .\nRT-PCR tests on them remained negative .\nWe followed them closely till December 2020 .\nWhile they remained free of the disease , 62 of their colleagues working in less risky areas of the hospital and clothed in scrubs like those at the emergency department but not using hydrogen peroxide , had COVID-19 by the end of December 2020 .\nBetween December 2020 and January 2021 , Ghana recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alpha and Beta variants ) which caused a spike in COVID-19 cases till March 2021 .\n[ 40 ] Realizing that their eight colleagues who managed patients , before they were diagnosed as COVID-19 and transferred to COVID-19 treatment centers , remained protected from the disease because they were using hydrogen peroxide , 86 other colleagues at that hospital decided to try it .\nFrom January to end of March 2021 , none of these 86 healthcare workers now using hydrogen peroxide plus the 8 emergency nurses contracted COVID-19 , while 10 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease .\nNew information from the Shai-Osudoku District Hospital reveals that there were 21 new cases of COVID-19 recorded among the healthcare staff in June 2022 .\nPrior to that , no new cases of COVID-19 were recorded since January 2022 .\nAll the twenty-one ( 21 ) affected healthcare workers were fully vaccinated and not using hydrogen peroxide .\nAt the Mount Olives Hospital which is a private facility in the Bono East Region of Ghana , another opportunity presented for observation of hydrogen peroxide protection against COVID-19 .\nTwenty-two ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this hospital for the first time in July 2020 and before hydrogen peroxide intervention .\nSeventeen ( 17 ) of these were healthcare workers , and five ( 5 ) were inpatients .\nHydrogen peroxide prophylactic use among inpatients and staff at Mount Olives Hospital was introduced in August 2020 .\nHydrogen peroxide use was also recommended for the healthcare staff on voluntary basis .\nBetween August 2020 and March 2021 , no cases of COVID-19 were recorded among a total of 3,375 inpatients on hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis twice a day .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases of COVID-19 were recorded among those ( 32 ) not using hydrogen peroxide .\nOf the 52 on hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis , two travelled outside the town for a week and did not use hydrogen peroxide during that period ; those two contracted COVID-19 .\nThe rest were free from disease .\nFrom April 2021 to December 2021 no cases of COVID-19 were recorded among inpatients ( total 4726 ) .\nWithin the same period too , no cases of the disease were found among the healthcare staff , all of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except one who stopped using hydrogen peroxide in the month of December and contracted the disease .\nAgain , this has been captured in our recent publications .\n[ 18 ] Recent information from this hospital is that no cases of COVID-19 have been recorded among healthcare workers and inpatients from January to June 2022 .\nAll healthcare workers ( current total 89 ) , and all inpatients ( total 2,484 for the period ) have continued on hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis , the staff remaining fully vaccinated .\nA summary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both institutions using hydrogen peroxide on a regular daily basis had COVID-19 over a period of 26 months since the study began .\nAt the Mount Olives Hospital , three staff members who stopped or interrupted hydrogen peroxide use over the period of the study had COVID-19 .\nOtherwise , no cases of COVID-19 were recorded after hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis was introduced .\nThere was not a single case of COVID-19 among a total of 10,220 inpatients on hydrogen peroxide between August 2020 and June 2022 .\nThat the 32 members of healthcare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first phase of the study ( between August 2020 and March 2021 ) did not use hydrogen peroxide and yet remained free of COVID-19 is not entirely surprising .\nThey most likely were protected by the large number of staff and patients using hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis , even though they could have come into contact with SARS-CoV-2 in the community .\nThat observation may indicate that hydrogen peroxide antiseptics curtails nosocomial spread SARS-CoV-2 .\nWe have also argued that if hydrogen peroxide protects individuals from being infected with the virus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infecting others , should these patients use it regularly .\n[ 18 ] Clinical studies should be conducted to establish that convincingly .\nBy that same logic , hydrogen peroxide use among COVID-19 patients including those with \u2018 long COVID \u2019 and those convalescing from the disease , could be expected to protect such patients from being reinfected with the viruses they are shedding .\nIn the current study , our attention was drawn to three individuals who became re-infected and had the disease within a period of three months of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been avoided , if these individuals had used hydrogen peroxide after the first infection .\nThese convincing clinical observations should encourage the use of hydrogen peroxide on a wider scale , especially among healthcare workers .\nIt is noted that some individuals might not be able to gargle or mouthwash effectively , such as children and those with neurological challenges like stroke .\nFor these individuals , mouth , throat and nasal swabs or spray with hydrogen peroxide should suffice .\nFinally , based on the growing evidence of hydrogen peroxide protection against @ @ @ @ @ @

"Editor , Sheila DeMare : As this is being written , the public is learning that the latest variant of Covid-19 , BA.5 , is easily transmitted and spreading rapidly in many parts of the USA and elsewhere .\nPrevious infection and/or immunizations , including boosters , are reportedly less effective in preventing BA.5 than earlier variants .\n( See here ) While basic CDC recommendations used

Service .\nThe report I received highlights evidence systematically collected by medical practitioners in Ghana for thousands of patients and some front-line staff .\nThe proposed concept is that hydrogen peroxide\u2014used in a very low , safe dilution\u2014can deactivate the virus in the mouth and nose , thereby preventing infection .\n( Shai-Osudoku District Hospital , one of the participating facilities , is shown in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peroxide has been used orally for decades in many dental practices .\nCovid-19 did not spare Ghana ( World Health Organization report ) and the positive results reported here are remarkable .\nThere was surely no conflict of interest by the authors , as hydrogen peroxide is easy to obtain and costs less than 20 cents an ounce ( USA ) .\nWe are sharing the simple approach for informational purposes The journal report below is comprehensive , and some readers may want to skip past the compelling technical justification for use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinical Use of Hydrogen Peroxide to Protect Healthcare Workers and Patients for an explanation of study results .\nHospital studies support daily mouth-washing and throat-gargling with 1 % hydrogen peroxide and 0.5 % for nasal cleansing ( July 08 , 2022 ) Dilute hydrogen peroxide has been demonstrated to be effective in preventing COVID-19 , deactivating SARS-COV-2 variants and their subvariants .\nNo cases of COVID-19 were recorded after hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis was introduced .\nThere was not a single case of COVID-19 among a total of 10,220 inpatients on hydrogen peroxide between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date , the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has affected 535 million people and claimed over 6.3 million lives globally .\n[ 1 ] New estimates from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) show that the full death toll associated directly or indirectly with the COVID-19 pandemic and described as \u201c excess mortality \u201d between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2021 , is approximately 14.9 million , ranging from 13.3 million to 16.6 million .\n[ 2 ] The current pandemic , therefore , is the world \u2019 s worst catastrophic event since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least 50 million deaths between 1918 and 1919 .\n[ 3 ] As of December 22nd 2020 when vaccinations against the disease had begun to be rolled out in Russia , China , the US and the UK , the estimated number of COVID-19 cases globally was 75 million , with 1.6 million deaths .\n[ 4 ] Since then , an estimated 11.8 billion doses of vaccines have been administered , with 4.7 billion people fully vaccinated .\n[ 5 ] In countries with more robust healthcare systems such as Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to four booster doses of vaccines have been given to vulnerable groups in an effort to abate the severity of clinical outcomes of the disease from infections caused by the new and more virulent and transmissible variants of SARS-CoV-2 .\n[ 6 ] Established public health protocols to prevent spread of the disease , such as nose and mouth coverings , use of alcohol-based sanitizers , frequent handwashing and safe distancing , have also been opted for in Ghana [ 7 ] , and most likely in many other countries over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite these interventions and the enforcement of standard public health preventive measures , the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase .\nSince November 2019 when the Wuhan strain of the virus first emerged , several variants of concern have also emerged .\n[ 8 ] The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have profound effects on health care and other societal systems , as well as the global economy .\nAs is the case in most humanitarian emergencies , the poorer developing nations have taken the hardest hits , and disadvantaged groups , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marginalization and exclusion , have suffered the most .\n[ 9 ] That is why the effort to identify more effective public health control measures must continue , with advocacy for trial use of oral and nasal antiseptics which include hydrogen peroxide , a known effective bactericidal and fungicidal agent .\n[ 10,11 ] In-vitro studies have shown that 3 % hydrogen peroxide inactivates SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses .\n[ 12,13 ] Since the emergence of COVID-19 , additional studies have demonstrated that even lower concentrations of hydrogen peroxide ( 1 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within one minute in-vitro .\n[ 14-16 ] Povidone has also been shown in in-vitro studies to inactivate the virus .\nThese comparative in-vitro studies suggest that povidone and hydrogen peroxide are most effective against the virus when the virus is exposed to them .\n[ 15 ] Clinical evidence of efficacy and safety of oral antiseptics against SARS-CoV-2 , had been lacking until recently .\n[ 16-19 ] Oral antiseptics including hydrogen peroxide had not featured in the preventive measures against previous coronavirus infections such as the SARS-CoV and the Middle East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this brief review , we have considered the scientific basis of the effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide antisepsis against SARS-CoV-2 , providing clinical evidence that this solution even in low concentrations protects against COVID-19 .\nEmphasis is being placed by researchers on oral antiseptics in the search for a solution to prevent COVID-19 because of the potential of these solutions to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 .\nFrom the results of in-vitro studies as noted above , it had been rightly assumed that viruses in the oronasal cavities and their adjacent pharyngeal spaces could be inactivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mucosal barriers in these regions to infect deeper lying cells to cause infection and disease .\nCritical in this consideration is the membrane wall of the virus and the spike proteins found on it .\nThis nature of the virus has recently been reviewed .\n[ 20-22 ] To be effective against an enveloped virus , the oral antiseptic must affect either the membrane wall of the virus or its spike proteins to prevent the S-protein from binding to the human Angiotensin Converting enzyme ( h-ACE ) receptor which is present in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respiratory system .\n[ 21 ] That is how the antiseptic inactivates the virus to prevent it from attaching to the mucosa and to penetrate to infect deeper lying cells to cause infection .\nBeing a powerful oxidant , hydrogen peroxide has a great potential to achieve the above .\nThe released reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) products of hydrogen peroxide rapidly modify the acyl chain by lipid peroxidation of the unsaturated chains in the membrane wall to destabilize the virus .\n[ 11,23 ] By that action , hydrogen peroxide directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus to attach to ACE receptors .\nThe ROS also directly affect amino acid chains of proteins [ 24 ] , and would , therefore , interfere with the structure of the spike proteins of the virus in the process of peroxidation , rendering them ineffective .\nOral antiseptics and the Incubation Period of the Coronavirus Even when a more transmissible variant or sub-variant of the virus enters the oronasal cavities , there is sufficient time for hydrogen peroxide deactivation to happen , if it is used daily .\nIt must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could escape residence in the oral and nasal cavities and their pharyngeal spaces to directly affect other parts of the trachea-bronchial tree including the alveolar pneumocytes , causing early disease with dire consequences .\n[ 27 ] This is why the recommendation for early intervention with hydrogen peroxide nebulization is vital in such cases to inactivate the virus before it causes disease directly involving the alveoli .\nThis subject has been extensively dealt with .\n[ 28-30 ] For that reason , those at greater risk of direct invasion of the lungs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and those with lifestyle activities requiring hyperventilation , must also boost their immune system with adequate levels of micronutrients such as Vitamin C , D and E , folic acid , zinc , and magnesium .\n[ 31 ] Other Rationale for Hydrogen Peroxide use in the Oronasal , and Oropharyngeal Cavities The rationale for topical use of hydrogen peroxide in the oral cavity is that the mucosa of the oral cavity and the oropharynx has a robust epithelium that is not easily corroded .\nThe stratified squamous keratinized and non-keratinized epithelial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oropharynx help to prevent damage .\nNoting that the reactive oxygen species generated by hydrogen peroxide has mutagenic properties , the epithelium of the oropharyngeal mucosae is even keratinized in some parts , [ 32 ] making those areas less vulnerable to mutagenicity .\nThe nasal cavity and its postnasal space , on the other hand , present a challenge : the mucosa here is less robust , except in the nasal vestibule which has stratified squamous keratinized epithelium .\nThe mucosal lining of the main nasal cavity as well as the nasopharynx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with mucus secreting goblet cells [ 32 ] , except in its roof including the adjacent surfaces of the superior conchae where olfactory epithelium exits .\nTo limit corrosion of these less robust types of epithelia in the nasal cavity , a lower concentration of hydrogen peroxide ( 0.5 % ) has been recommended .\n[ 18,33 ] That is the reason why only 2-3 drops of the 0.5 % hydrogen solution per day are required and for a period of one minute .\nMutagenicity of Hydrogen Peroxide and other Adverse Effects We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address it more fully , as it is of the utmost importance in any recommendation of hydrogen peroxide topical use .\nIn a publication in the British Medical Journal , we addressed that challenge [ 33 ] , drawing attention to an extensive review on the subject by Walsh [ 34 ] and Marshall et.al .\n[ 35 ] So far , no evidence has been found in human studies of cellular mutation in oral use of hydrogen peroxide at concentrations of 3 % .\nEven hydrogen peroxide use at concentrations of 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown any evidence of mutagenicity .\nIn their review of hydrogen peroxide safety , it was noted that some individuals had used hydrogen peroxide daily for 6 years without deleterious effects .\n[ 35 ] It is also to be noted that hydrogen peroxide is an essential product in the metabolism of innate immune cells to destroy pathogens through peroxidation .\nThe ROS released in that process are quickly detoxified to protect body cells by enzymes such as catalase , superoxide dismutase , and glutathione peroxidase .\n[ 36 ] Saliva has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glutathione reductase .\n[ 37 ] Any excess of hydrogen peroxide in the oral cavity and oropharynx would therefore be detoxified by these enzymes in saliva .\nAccidental swallowing of 3 % hydrogen peroxide , however , is known to cause gastric irritation in some individuals .\nIn the two-year period of study of hydrogen peroxide use to prevent COVID-19 , our attention has not been drawn to any such deleterious effect in those using the hydrogen peroxide solution .\nProphylactic Use of Oral Antiseptics in Dental Practice to Protect Patients and Staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hydrogen peroxide in dental clinics suggests that it is useful in reducing SARS-CoV-2 viral load [ 16 ] , corroborating the use of oral antiseptics employed in dental practice as an antidote to SARS-CoV-2 transmission .\n[ 38 ] In Ghana , both povidone and hydrogen peroxide are in use clinically for patients before non-surgical and surgical dental procedures ( Personal communication \u2013 Dr. Mary Ayettey-Adamafio , co-author ) .\nThis practice is intended to protect both patients and staff from contracting the coronavirus .\nIt is helpful too for the patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microbial organisms that might otherwise escape into the blood stream to cause disease .\n[ 4 ] Clinical Use of Hydrogen Peroxide to Protect Healthcare Workers and Patients This is the crux of our current research published to date .\n[ 17,18 ] From our observations that very low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide protect hospital staff who are most at risk of contracting COVID-19 , from the strong anecdotal evidence of hydrogen peroxide protection from the disease , and from the growing international interest in the use of oral antiseptics to prevent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in March 2020 to investigate the relationship between hydrogen peroxide and coronaviruses .\nIndeed , since then , other investigators have also shared anecdotal evidence of hydrogen peroxide benefits even in treatment of COVID-19 .\n[ 28,30 ] While preparing a protocol for clinical investigation of the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide protection against COVID-19 , we were fortuitously presented with an opportunity to observe eight emergency care nurses at the Shai-Osudoku District Hospital who , on their own volition , had been using hydrogen peroxide since May 2020 to protect themselves from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only preventive protocols were the established public health measures including mouth and nose covers , frequent washing of hands with soap under running water , and use of hand sanitizers .\nOnly those who were managing confirmed COVID-19 cases wore the full personal protective equipment clothing suit .\nThese emergency-care nurses wore ordinary scrubs ; there were no vaccines available at the time ; neither were there fail-proof therapeutic remedies for the disease .\nUnknown to us , these eight healthcare workers had heard about our advocacy for 1 % hydrogen peroxide daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute and 0.5 % for nasal cleansing through several social platforms to save lives , and were using it .\nThe reason for promoting hydrogen peroxide use was that team members and their relatives using the solution and who had been exposed to the disease had been protected .\nBy May 2020 , anecdotal evidence of hydrogen peroxide protection against COVID-19 had already become strong .\nFaced with the real challenge of rapid spreading of the disease , and without fail-proof preventive measures and therapeutic interventions , we were obliged to share more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection with the wider family , friends , colleagues , neighbors and others including religious bodies , recognizing also that this antiseptic is an off-the-counter solution that had been in use in dental practice for decades .\n[ 35 ] It was observed that these eight nurses remained free of COVID-19 , even though they attended to several patients at the facility who were later diagnosed with COVID-19 .\nRT-PCR tests on them remained negative .\nWe followed them closely till December 2020 .\nWhile they remained free of the disease , 62 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of the hospital and clothed in scrubs like those at the emergency department but not using hydrogen peroxide , had COVID-19 by the end of December 2020 .\nBetween December 2020 and January 2021 , Ghana recorded two new variants of SARS-CoV-2 ( the Alpha and Beta variants ) which caused a spike in COVID-19 cases till March 2021 .\n[ 40 ] Realizing that their eight colleagues who managed patients , before they were diagnosed as COVID-19 and transferred to COVID-19 treatment centers , remained protected from the disease because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues at that hospital decided to try it .\nFrom January to end of March 2021 , none of these 86 healthcare workers now using hydrogen peroxide plus the 8 emergency nurses contracted COVID-19 , while 10 of their colleagues not using hydrogen peroxide had the disease .\nNew information from the Shai-Osudoku District Hospital reveals that there were 21 new cases of COVID-19 recorded among the healthcare staff in June 2022 .\nPrior to that , no new cases of COVID-19 were recorded since January 2022 .\nAll the twenty-one ( 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not using hydrogen peroxide .\nAt the Mount Olives Hospital which is a private facility in the Bono East Region of Ghana , another opportunity presented for observation of hydrogen peroxide protection against COVID-19 .\nTwenty-two ( 22 ) cases of COVID-19 were recorded at this hospital for the first time in July 2020 and before hydrogen peroxide intervention .\nSeventeen ( 17 ) of these were healthcare workers , and five ( 5 ) were inpatients .\nHydrogen peroxide prophylactic use among inpatients and staff at Mount Olives Hospital was introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also recommended for the healthcare staff on voluntary basis .\nBetween August 2020 and March 2021 , no cases of COVID-19 were recorded among a total of 3,375 inpatients on hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis twice a day .\nOf the members of staff , no cases of COVID-19 were recorded among those ( 32 ) not using hydrogen peroxide .\nOf the 52 on hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis , two travelled outside the town for a week and did not use hydrogen peroxide during that period ; those two contracted COVID-19 .\nThe rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2021 to December 2021 no cases of COVID-19 were recorded among inpatients ( total 4726 ) .\nWithin the same period too , no cases of the disease were found among the healthcare staff , all of whom were fully vaccinated and using hydrogen peroxide , except one who stopped using hydrogen peroxide in the month of December and contracted the disease .\nAgain , this has been captured in our recent publications .\n[ 18 ] Recent information from this hospital is that no cases of COVID-19 have been recorded among healthcare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2022 .\nAll healthcare workers ( current total 89 ) , and all inpatients ( total 2,484 for the period ) have continued on hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis , the staff remaining fully vaccinated .\nA summary of the observations so far is that none at both institutions using hydrogen peroxide on a regular daily basis had COVID-19 over a period of 26 months since the study began .\nAt the Mount Olives Hospital , three staff members who stopped or interrupted hydrogen peroxide use over the period of the study had COVID-19 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded after hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis was introduced .\nThere was not a single case of COVID-19 among a total of 10,220 inpatients on hydrogen peroxide between August 2020 and June 2022 .\nThat the 32 members of healthcare staff at the Mount Olives Hospital who in the first phase of the study ( between August 2020 and March 2021 ) did not use hydrogen peroxide and yet remained free of COVID-19 is not entirely surprising .\nThey most likely were protected by the large number of staff and patients using hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into contact with SARS-CoV-2 in the community .\nThat observation may indicate that hydrogen peroxide antiseptics curtails nosocomial spread SARS-CoV-2 .\nWe have also argued that if hydrogen peroxide protects individuals from being infected with the virus , it would also protect COVID-19 patients from infecting others , should these patients use it regularly .\n[ 18 ] Clinical studies should be conducted to establish that convincingly .\nBy that same logic , hydrogen peroxide use among COVID-19 patients including those with \u2018 long COVID \u2019 and those convalescing from the disease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from being reinfected with the viruses they are shedding .\nIn the current study , our attention was drawn to three individuals who became re-infected and had the disease within a period of three months of the first infections .\nLikely , this could have been avoided , if these individuals had used hydrogen peroxide after the first infection .\nThese convincing clinical observations should encourage the use of hydrogen peroxide on a wider scale , especially among healthcare workers .\nIt is noted that some individuals might not be able to gargle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those with neurological challenges like stroke .\nFor these individuals , mouth , throat and nasal swabs or spray with hydrogen peroxide should suffice .\nFinally , based on the growing evidence of hydrogen peroxide protection against COVID-19 , we recommend its wider use to mitigate the pandemic .\n*Andrews S.

District Hospital , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article \u2019 s photo . )\nLow concentration levels of hydrogen peroxide have been used orally for decades in many dental practices .\nCovid-19 did not spare Ghana ( World Health Organization report ) and the positive results reported here are remarkable .\nThere was surely no conflict of interest by the authors , as hydrogen peroxide is easy to obtain and costs less than 20 cents an ounce ( USA ) .\nThe protocol can also be self-administered , requiring no professional assistance .\nWe are sharing the simple approach for informational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensive , and some readers may want to skip past the compelling technical justification for the use of hydrogen peroxide and focus on the subtitle Clinical Use of Hydrogen Peroxide to Protect Healthcare Workers and Patients for an explanation of study results .\nHospital studies support daily mouth-washing and throat-gargling with 1 % hydrogen peroxide and 0.5 % for nasal cleansing ( July 08 , 2022 ) Dilute hydrogen peroxide has been demonstrated to be effective in preventing COVID-19 , deactivating SARS-COV-2 variants and their subvariants .\nNo cases of COVID-19 were recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was not a single case of COVID-19 among a total of 10,220 inpatients on hydrogen peroxide between August 2020 and June 2022 .\nTo date , the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has affected 535 million people and claimed over 6.3 million lives globally .\n[ 1 ] New estimates from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) show that the full death toll associated directly or indirectly with the COVID-19 pandemic and described as \u201c excess mortality \u201d between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2021 , is approximately 14.9 million , ranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ 2 ] The current pandemic , therefore , is the world \u2019 s worst catastrophic event since the Spanish pandemic influenza that resulted in at least 50 million deaths between 1918 and 1919 .\n[ 3 ] As of December 22nd 2020 when vaccinations against the disease had begun to be rolled out in Russia , China , the US and the UK , the estimated number of COVID-19 cases globally was 75 million , with 1.6 million deaths .\n[ 4 ] Since then , an estimated 11.8 billion doses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion people fully vaccinated .\n[ 5 ] In countries with more robust healthcare systems such as Israel , Denmark , Sweden and Norway , up to four booster doses of vaccines have been given to vulnerable groups in an effort to abate the severity of clinical outcomes of the disease from infections caused by the new and more virulent and transmissible variants of SARS-CoV-2 .\n[ 6 ] Established public health protocols to prevent spread of the disease , such as nose and mouth coverings , use of alcohol-based sanitizers , frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been opted for in Ghana [ 7 ] , and most likely in many other countries over the first 24 months of the pandemic .\nDespite these interventions and the enforcement of standard public health preventive measures , the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase .\nSince November 2019 when the Wuhan strain of the virus first emerged , several variants of concern have also emerged .\n[ 8 ] The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have profound effects on health care and other societal systems , as well as the global economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanitarian emergencies , the poorer developing nations have taken the hardest hits , and disadvantaged groups , particularly people living in poverty and subject to marginalization and exclusion , have suffered the most .\n[ 9 ] That is why the effort to identify more effective public health control measures must continue , with advocacy for trial use of oral and nasal antiseptics which include hydrogen peroxide , a known effective bactericidal and fungicidal agent .\n[ 10,11 ] In-vitro studies have shown that 3 % hydrogen peroxide inactivates SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergence of COVID-19 , additional studies have demonstrated that even lower concentrations of hydrogen peroxide ( 1 % and 0.5 % ) inactivate the virus within one minute in-vitro .\n[ 14-16 ] Povidone has also been shown in in-vitro studies to inactivate the virus .\nThese comparative in-vitro studies suggest that povidone and hydrogen peroxide are most effective against the virus when the virus is exposed to them .\n[ 15 ] Clinical evidence of efficacy and safety of oral antiseptics against SARS-CoV-2 , had been lacking until recently .\n[ 16-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not featured in the preventive measures against previous coronavirus infections such as the SARS-CoV and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) epidemics .\nIn this brief review , we have considered the scientific basis of the effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide antisepsis against SARS-CoV-2 , providing clinical evidence that this solution even in low concentrations protects against COVID-19 .\nEmphasis is being placed by researchers on oral antiseptics in the search for a solution to prevent COVID-19 because of the potential of these solutions to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 .\nFrom the results of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been rightly assumed that viruses in the oronasal cavities and their adjacent pharyngeal spaces could be inactivated before they attach to and penetrate the mucosal barriers in these regions to infect deeper lying cells to cause infection and disease .\nCritical in this consideration is the membrane wall of the virus and the spike proteins found on it .\nThis nature of the virus has recently been reviewed .\n[ 20-22 ] To be effective against an enveloped virus , the oral antiseptic must affect either the membrane wall of the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S-protein from binding to the human Angiotensin Converting enzyme ( h-ACE ) receptor which is present in the mucus membrane of all parts of the respiratory system .\n[ 21 ] That is how the antiseptic inactivates the virus to prevent it from attaching to the mucosa and to penetrate to infect deeper lying cells to cause infection .\nBeing a powerful oxidant , hydrogen peroxide has a great potential to achieve the above .\nThe released reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) products of hydrogen peroxide rapidly modify the acyl chain by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the membrane wall to destabilize the virus .\n[ 11,23 ] By that action , hydrogen peroxide directly limits and even destroys the ability of the virus to attach to ACE receptors .\nThe ROS also directly affect amino acid chains of proteins [ 24 ] , and would , therefore , interfere with the structure of the spike proteins of the virus in the process of peroxidation , rendering them ineffective .\nOral antiseptics and the Incubation Period of the Coronavirus Even when a more transmissible variant or sub-variant of the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient time for hydrogen peroxide deactivation to happen , if it is used daily .\nIt must be noted , however , that the virus could escape residence in the oral and nasal cavities and their pharyngeal spaces to directly affect other parts of the trachea-bronchial tree including the alveolar pneumocytes , causing early disease with dire consequences .\n[ 27 ] This is why the recommendation for early intervention with hydrogen peroxide nebulization is vital in such cases to inactivate the virus before it causes disease directly involving the alveoli .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ 28-30 ] For that reason , those at greater risk of direct invasion of the lungs with viruses such as healthcare workers , athletes , and those with lifestyle activities requiring hyperventilation , must also boost their immune system with adequate levels of micronutrients such as Vitamin C , D and E , folic acid , zinc , and magnesium .\n[ 31 ] Other Rationale for Hydrogen Peroxide use in the Oronasal , and Oropharyngeal Cavities The rationale for topical use of hydrogen peroxide in the oral cavity is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oropharynx has a robust epithelium that is not easily corroded .\nThe stratified squamous keratinized and non-keratinized epithelial nature of the oral cavity and the oropharynx help to prevent damage .\nNoting that the reactive oxygen species generated by hydrogen peroxide has mutagenic properties , the epithelium of the oropharyngeal mucosae is even keratinized in some parts , [ 32 ] making those areas less vulnerable to mutagenicity .\nThe nasal cavity and its postnasal space , on the other hand , present a challenge : the mucosa here is less robust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stratified squamous keratinized epithelium .\nThe mucosal lining of the main nasal cavity as well as the nasopharynx is pseudo-stratified columnar type of epithelium interspersed with mucus secreting goblet cells [ 32 ] , except in its roof including the adjacent surfaces of the superior conchae where olfactory epithelium exits .\nTo limit corrosion of these less robust types of epithelia in the nasal cavity , a lower concentration of hydrogen peroxide ( 0.5 % ) has been recommended .\n[ 18,33 ] That is the reason why only 2-3 drops of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required and for a period of one minute .\nMutagenicity of Hydrogen Peroxide and other Adverse Effects We have referred to this already but must address it more fully , as it is of the utmost importance in any recommendation of hydrogen peroxide topical use .\nIn a publication in the British Medical Journal , we addressed that challenge [ 33 ] , drawing attention to an extensive review on the subject by Walsh [ 34 ] and Marshall et.al .\n[ 35 ] So far , no evidence has been found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of hydrogen peroxide at concentrations of 3 % .\nEven hydrogen peroxide use at concentrations of 6 % for whitening of teeth has not shown any evidence of mutagenicity .\nIn their review of hydrogen peroxide safety , it was noted that some individuals had used hydrogen peroxide daily for 6 years without deleterious effects .\n[ 35 ] It is also to be noted that hydrogen peroxide is an essential product in the metabolism of innate immune cells to destroy pathogens through peroxidation .\nThe ROS released in that process are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enzymes such as catalase , superoxide dismutase , and glutathione peroxidase .\n[ 36 ] Saliva has been found to contain peroxidase , catalase and glutathione reductase .\n[ 37 ] Any excess of hydrogen peroxide in the oral cavity and oropharynx would therefore be detoxified by these enzymes in saliva .\nAccidental swallowing of 3 % hydrogen peroxide , however , is known to cause gastric irritation in some individuals .\nIn the two-year period of study of hydrogen peroxide use to prevent COVID-19 , our attention has not been drawn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hydrogen peroxide solution .\nProphylactic Use of Oral Antiseptics in Dental Practice to Protect Patients and Staff from COVID-19 Recent data on the use of hydrogen peroxide in dental clinics suggests that it is useful in reducing SARS-CoV-2 viral load [ 16 ] , corroborating the use of oral antiseptics employed in dental practice as an antidote to SARS-CoV-2 transmission .\n[ 38 ] In Ghana , both povidone and hydrogen peroxide are in use clinically for patients before non-surgical and surgical dental procedures ( Personal communication \u2013 Dr. Mary Ayettey-Adamafio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect both patients and staff from contracting the coronavirus .\nIt is helpful too for the patient , as the oral antiseptic inactivates other microbial organisms that might otherwise escape into the blood stream to cause disease .\n[ 4 ] Clinical Use of Hydrogen Peroxide to Protect Healthcare Workers and Patients This is the crux of our current research published to date .\n[ 17,18 ] From our observations that very low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide protect hospital staff who are most at risk of contracting COVID-19 , from the strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease , and from the growing international interest in the use of oral antiseptics to prevent the disease , we recognize a providential guidance in March 2020 to investigate the relationship between hydrogen peroxide and coronaviruses .\nIndeed , since then , other investigators have also shared anecdotal evidence of hydrogen peroxide benefits even in treatment of COVID-19 .\n[ 28,30 ] While preparing a protocol for clinical investigation of the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide protection against COVID-19 , we were fortuitously presented with an opportunity to observe eight emergency care nurses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their own volition , had been using hydrogen peroxide since May 2020 to protect themselves from the disease .\nAt that time , the only preventive protocols were the established public health measures including mouth and nose covers , frequent washing of hands with soap under running water , and use of hand sanitizers .\nOnly those who were managing confirmed COVID-19 cases wore the full personal protective equipment clothing suit .\nThese emergency-care nurses wore ordinary scrubs ; there were no vaccines available at the time ; neither were there fail-proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us , these eight healthcare workers had heard about our advocacy for 1 % hydrogen peroxide daily use for mouth-washing and throat-gargling for one minute and 0.5 % for nasal cleansing through several social platforms to save lives , and were using it .\nThe reason for promoting hydrogen peroxide use was that team members and their relatives using the solution and who had been exposed to the disease had been protected .\nBy May 2020 , anecdotal evidence of hydrogen peroxide protection against COVID-19 had already become strong .\nFaced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease , and without fail-proof preventive measures and therapeutic interventions , we were obliged to share more widely the anecdotal evidence of hydrogen peroxide protection with the wider family , friends , colleagues , neighbors and others including religious bodies , recognizing also that this antiseptic is an off-the-counter solution that had been in use in dental practice for decades .\n[ 35 ] It was observed that these eight nurses remained free of COVID-19 , even though they attended to several patients at the facility who were later diagnosed with COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe followed them closely till December 2020 .\nWhile they remained free of the disease , 62 of their colleagues working in less risky areas of the hospital and clothed in scrubs like those at the emergency department but not using hydrogen peroxide , had COVID-19 by the end of December 2020 .\nBetween December 2020 and January 2021 , Ghana recorded two new variants of SARS-CoV-2 ( the Alpha and Beta variants ) which caused a spike in COVID-19 cases till March 2021 .\n[ 40 ] Realizing that their eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were diagnosed as COVID-19 and transferred to COVID-19 treatment centers , remained protected from the disease because they were using hydrogen peroxide , 86 other colleagues at that hospital decided to try it .\nFrom January to end of March 2021 , none of these 86 healthcare workers now using hydrogen peroxide plus the 8 emergency nurses contracted COVID-19 , while 10 of their colleagues not using hydrogen peroxide had the disease .\nNew information from the Shai-Osudoku District Hospital reveals that there were 21 new cases of COVID-19 recorded among the healthcare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , no new cases of COVID-19 were recorded since January 2022 .\nAll the twenty-one ( 21 ) affected healthcare workers were fully vaccinated and not using hydrogen peroxide .\nAt the Mount Olives Hospital which is a private facility in the Bono East Region of Ghana , another opportunity presented for observation of hydrogen peroxide protection against COVID-19 .\nTwenty-two ( 22 ) cases of COVID-19 were recorded at this hospital for the first time in July 2020 and before hydrogen peroxide intervention .\nSeventeen ( 17 ) of these were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) were inpatients .\nHydrogen peroxide prophylactic use among inpatients and staff at Mount Olives Hospital was introduced in August 2020 .\nHydrogen peroxide use was also recommended for the healthcare staff on voluntary basis .\nBetween August 2020 and March 2021 , no cases of COVID-19 were recorded among a total of 3,375 inpatients on hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis twice a day .\nOf the members of staff , no cases of COVID-19 were recorded among those ( 32 ) not using hydrogen peroxide .\nOf the 52 on hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week and did not use hydrogen peroxide during that period ; those two contracted COVID-19 .\nThe rest were free from disease .\nFrom April 2021 to December 2021 no cases of COVID-19 were recorded among inpatients ( total 4726 ) .\nWithin the same period too , no cases of the disease were found among the healthcare staff , all of whom were fully vaccinated and using hydrogen peroxide , except one who stopped using hydrogen peroxide in the month of December and contracted the disease .\nAgain , this has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 ] Recent information from this hospital is that no cases of COVID-19 have been recorded among healthcare workers and inpatients from January to June 2022 .\nAll healthcare workers ( current total 89 ) , and all inpatients ( total 2,484 for the period ) have continued on hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis , the staff remaining fully vaccinated .\nA summary of the observations so far is that none at both institutions using hydrogen peroxide on a regular daily basis had COVID-19 over a period of 26 months since the study began .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff members who stopped or interrupted hydrogen peroxide use over the period of the study had COVID-19 .\nOtherwise , no cases of COVID-19 were recorded after hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis was introduced .\nThere was not a single case of COVID-19 among a total of 10,220 inpatients on hydrogen peroxide between August 2020 and June 2022 .\nThat the 32 members of healthcare staff at the Mount Olives Hospital who in the first phase of the study ( between August 2020 and March 2021 ) did not use hydrogen peroxide and yet remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey most likely were protected by the large number of staff and patients using hydrogen peroxide prophylaxis , even though they could have come into contact with SARS-CoV-2 in the community .\nThat observation may indicate that hydrogen peroxide antiseptics curtails nosocomial spread SARS-CoV-2 .\nWe have also argued that if hydrogen peroxide protects individuals from being infected with the virus , it would also protect COVID-19 patients from infecting others , should these patients use it regularly .\n[ 18 ] Clinical studies should be conducted to establish that convincingly .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ use among COVID-19 patients including those with \u2018 long COVID \u2019 and those convalescing from the disease , could be expected to protect such patients from being reinfected with the viruses they are shedding .\nIn the current study , our attention was drawn to three individuals who became re-infected and had the disease within a period of three months of the first infections .\nLikely , this could have been avoided , if these individuals had used hydrogen peroxide after the first infection .\nThese convincing clinical observations should encourage the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially among healthcare workers .\nIt is noted that some individuals might not be able to gargle or mouthwash effectively , such as children and those with neurological challenges like stroke .\nFor these individuals , mouth , throat and nasal swabs or spray with hydrogen peroxide should suffice .\nFinally , based on the growing evidence of hydrogen peroxide protection against COVID-19 , we recommend its wider use to mitigate the pandemic .\n*Andrews S.

.\n\u2022 The maximum of 11 bouts per day was associated with a 65 percent reduction in cardiovascular death risk and 49 percent reduction in cancer-related death risk , compared to no VILPA .\nInterestingly , a comparative analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who regularly engaged in exercise found comparable results .\nThis implies that whether the vigorous activity is done as part of structured

non-exercisers \u2019 , participants who self-reported that they do not do any sports or exercise during leisure time .\nBy this method , the researchers could conclude that any activity recorded by

protective covering of nerves in the brain , spinal cord and eyes .\nAccording to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society , it affects nearly 1 million adults in the United States .\nSeveral previous studies have differentiated the microbiomes of MS patients and healthy subjects , but , Ito said , they all noted different abnormalities , so it was impossible to tell what change , if any , was driving disease progression .\nThe Rutgers study , which was led by research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineered with MS-associated genes to trace the link between alterations in the gut bacteria and an MS-like condition called experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) .\nAs these mice matured \u2014 and simultaneously developed EAE and a gut inflammatory condition called colitis \u2014 the researchers observed increased recruitment of inflammatory cells ( neutrophils ) to the colon and production of an anti-microbial protein called lipocalin 2 ( Lcn-2 ) .\nThe study team then looked for evidence that the same process occurred in people with MS and found significantly elevated Lcn-2 levels in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced bacterial diversity and increased levels of other markers of intestinal inflammation .\nRead more here : Journal Link : Frontiers in Immunology", "author": "ACN Report", "url": "https://latitudes.org/poor-gut-health-may-drive-multiple-sclerosis-better-diet-may-help/",

in brain tissue , specifically in adults who suffered from varying rates of cognitive decline .\nThey found that members of this group with higher levels of vitamin D in their brains had better cognitive function .\nThe study was published December 7 2022 in Alzheimer \u2019 s & Dementia : The Journal of the Alzheimer \u2019 s Association .\n\u201c This research reinforces the importance of studying how food and nutrients create resilience to protect the aging brain against diseases such as Alzheimer \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said senior and corresponding author Sarah Booth , director of the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging ( HNRCA ) at Tufts and lead scientist of the HNRCA \u2019 s Vitamin K Team .\nIn the Tufts study , researchers looked for vitamin D in four regions of the brain\u2014two associated with changes linked to Alzheimer \u2019 s disease , one associated with forms of dementia linked to blood flow , and one region without any known associations with cognitive decline related to Alzheimer \u2019 s disease or vascular disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed present in brain tissue , and high vitamin D levels in all four regions of the brain correlated with better cognitive function .\nVitamin D supports many functions in the body , including immune responses and maintaining healthy bones .\nDietary sources include fatty fish and fortified beverages ( such as milk or orange juice ) ; brief exposure to sunlight also provides a dose of vitamin D. \u201c Many studies have implicated dietary or nutritional factors in cognitive performance or function

an associate professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts .\n\u201c We wanted to know if vitamin D is even present in the brain , and if it is , how those concentrations are linked to cognitive decline.\n\u201d Booth , Shea , and their team examined samples of brain tissue from 209 participants in the Rush Memory and Aging Project , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease that began in 1997 .\nResearchers at Rush University assessed the cognitive function of the participants , older people with no signs of cognitive impairment , as they aged , and analyzed irregularities in their

, including amyloid plaque buildup , Lewy body disease , or evidence of chronic or microscopic strokes .\nThis means it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might affect brain function .\n\u201c Dementia is
