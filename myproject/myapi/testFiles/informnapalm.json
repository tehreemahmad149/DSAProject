interesting that the Russian diplomatic mission in Belarus did not publicly announce either the fact of Elkin \u2019 s appointment , or the fact of Kolyuchkin \u2019 s dismissal .\nHowever , we know that Igor Elkin as a military attach\u00e9 in the Navy Day celebration in Minsk on July 25 , 2021 ( in the presentation of medical equipment from the Russian Ministry of Defense to a Belarusian

and the troops of the Special Forces Center of the Russian Federation Senezh would be the ones sent to Kazakhstan .\nAccording to investigations by InformNapalm international intelligence community , all these units took part in the aggression against Ukraine not only during the operation to seize and occupy Crimea , but also in the hostilities in the Donbas : \u2022 98th Airborne Division ( military unit 65451 ) .\nServicemen from two units of the division , the 217th Airborne Regiment ( military unit 62295 ) and the 331st Airborne Regiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in Ukraine .\n\u2022 45th Special Forces Brigade ( military unit 28337 ) .\nInterestingly , in 2014 , the 45th Separate Regiment of the Airborne Forces was expanded into a brigade to increase the overall number of Russian airborne troops .\nIt is noteworthy that in 2001 , officers of the 45th Airborne Regiment , including Igor Girkin ( Strelkov ) , who is notorious for his role in the events in the Donbas , carried out a series of abductions of residents from the Chechen villages of Khatuni , Makhkety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , four have been well investigated ; the abducted persons are still missing .\nIt is important to note that Russia is using for \u201c peacekeeping tasks \u201d and international exercises abroad the same units that took part in the hybrid aggression against Ukraine .\nFor instance , on November 10 , 2020 , Russia transferred the servicemen of the 15th Motorized Rifle Brigade ( military unit 90600 ) to Nagorno-Karabakh .\nInformNapalm had repeatedly observed soldiers of this brigade participating in the hostilities in the Donbas .\nThere is also evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seize Crimea .\nIn addition , in 2021 , Russia deployed paratroopers of the 76th Air Assault Division ( AAD ) of the Russian Army ( military unit 07264 ) to Belarus for snap airdrop exercises near the borders of Lithuania and Poland .\nInformNapalm \u2019 s OSINT database contains numerous evidence of the participation of soldiers of the Russian 76th AAD in the war against Georgia , the invasion of Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine .\nIt was also documented that paratroopers of the 104th Air Assault Regiment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seizure of drilling rigs belonging to the Ukrainian enterprise Chornomornaftogaz in 2014 .\nIt is also possible that the Kremlin , considering the increased attention of the international community to the events in Kazakhstan , will not dare to openly use Russian military personnel to kill and abduct protesters in Kazakhstan , but will instead use hybrid units for these purposes .\nArrivals to Kazakhstan of military transport aircraft from Russia were reported on January 5 .\nAt that time , there was no CSTO decision yet , and no troop deployments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these transport aircraft could have delivered mercenaries of the Russian PMC Wagner , who not only took part in the hostilities against Ukraine , but also fought in the interests of the Kremlin in Syria , Libya , Sudan , and other countries .\nThe use of mercenaries from Russian PMCs , affiliated with the special forces of the Russian Army and Russian special services , so far has allowed the Kremlin to avoid direct responsibility for war crimes in other countries , hide losses , and solve other delicate tasks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regimes ask Moscow for help .\nThat is , the Kremlin

Transnational Repression Adapted by Belarus", "content": "Recent examples of murder and intimidation of political opponents , suggest that Belarus has followed Kremlin \u2019 s footsteps in adopting transnational repression as a tactic .\nEven though such practices dates back to at least the early 1910s , with dictators across the globe searching for an extension of their power , a visible new wave of transnational repression has been noticed quite recently , through 2000s .\nAuthoritarian regimes recognized transnational repression was as a attention worthy state practice , formally described as process of \u201e targeting of co-national political opponents , civil society advocates , non-compliant business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by governments and their internal security and intelligence services \u201c .\nTransnational repression is being actively used in practice nowadays , including many different extraterritorial acts , such as active monitoring , restricting overseas travels , coercive acts against political exiles by agents , abductions , family intimidations and many more .\nOne of the biggest culprits of this process in its political agenda is the Kremlin and its campaign .\nThe Russian government has a long tradition of conducting highly aggressive transnational repression activities outside its borders .\nAs catalogued in Freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Russian campaign accounts for 7 of 26 assassinations or assassination attempts since 2014 .\nThe Kremlin heavily relies on assassination as a tool , targets former insiders and others who are perceived as threats to the regime \u2019 s security .\nSince the pro-democratic protests and unrest started showing in Belarus , it seems that Lukashenka \u2019 s regime is also adapting this method with Kremlin \u2019 s blessing .\nOne of the most recent events that hit the media was the murder of an active Belarus dissident Vitaly Shishov .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whole Belarus and activists around the globe were shaken with the news of death of Vitaly Shishov .\nShishov was found hanging in the park , after not he went missing while going for a jog in the evening .\nQuickly after that , demonstrations broke through near the Embassy of Belarus in the city of Kyiv .\nCrowd of people , expressing their condolences with symbolic red and white colors in different shapes , gathered to attract attention to yet another possible act of transnational repression .\nTweets about demonstrations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vitaly Shishov .\n( Twitter/mjluxmoore , Twitter/Liveuamap ) One colleague of Vitaly , Yuri Shchuchko , revealed that police said Shishov had marks on his face when found , suggesting that he had been beaten up , so the already low possibility of suicide became even less plausible .\nMr Shchuchko also said Ukrainian security officers and police had privately warned the Belarusian House in Ukraine ( BHU ) about constant threats to the activists .\nShishov has been the head of this NGO , which was actively helping Belarusian citizens who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president Alexander Lukashenko , held rallies in Kyiv in support of the Belarusian opposition and was constantly spreading news about the crimes of the Lukashenko regime , thus earning attention from the local and international security services .\nAnother important aspect reconsidering actions of already mentioned security services is their ( inter ) dependence and bias .\nCountries of Russia and Belarus are interrelated on so many different fields , such as economy , politics , military , etc .\nAmong security services , the Belarusian KGB ( BKGB ) also works closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FSB ) and the Foreign Intelligence Service ( SVR ) .\nThe relationship between the security services of both countries is so strong that one could hardly tell apart Lukashenko \u2019 s KGB or SOF or Putin \u2019 s spy-services \u2013 Russia \u2019 s military intelligence agency ( GRU ) .\nLatter is believed to have targeted Shishov in Kyiv .\nRecent example is far away from being one of a kind , but rather a part of a tragic growth and tendency of transnational repression .\nEven though this process was pioneered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used around the globe , not omitting the context of Belarus .\nFor quite many years , Russians abroad , who have been engaged in high-profile political opposition , were known to be constantly facing surveillance and sophisticated hacking campaigns with the same techniques the government uses against high-priority national security targets .\nMany examples throughout the last decade could be mentioned within this context , such as journalist Pavel Sheremet , whose hard-hitting coverage of political oppression in Belarus angered the authorities and he was blown up by a car bomb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissidents ( Zakharenko , Gonchar , Krasovsky and Zavadsky ) , that were later reported to be killed and many others unfortunate fates .\nWide and brutal net of security services , well disposed towards authoritarian regimes , is actively shutting down all of those , daring to stand against the established order .\nUnfortunate destinies of those , daring to voice against well-established regimes do not limit themselves to mentioned before .\nOn March 4 , 2018 , in Salisbury , United Kingdom , British citizen Sergei Skripal , a former Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a police officer were exposed to a highly toxic and potentially lethal chemical weapon agent .\nHuge wave of peaceful protests sparked widespread in Belarus , after the openly falsified electoral results in Belarus .\nThey were followed by a brutal state militia crack down , forcing the eligible president \u2013 Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya \u2013 to flee her country .\nOnce again , with taking minor and temporary sanctions aimed at Belarus for lacking democratic legitimacy , the EU did not scare the aggressor and let him move on with further plans .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of Russia \u2019 s leading opposition activists , was poisoned by a banned nerve agent .\nAfter the accident , even though the media was overflowing with Navalny-related messages , the Department of State called the attack an \u201c attempted assassination \u201d and determined Russia had used a chemical weapon in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention , the EU has not imposed any additional sanctions on Russia .\nIn rather obedient reaction EU did not show any specific actions to confront the agressors and neither stopped nor warned Russia of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the associated examples of internationally working repression mechanisms , one could mention a recent case , bringing back to the death of Shishov .\nThe head of the Belarusian House in Ukraine , Rodion Batulin , was visiting the European Union , but after the tragic news related to the death of Shishov , he immediately returned to Kyiv .\nHowever , the deputy of the deceased was not allowed to enter Ukraine on the Polish-Ukrainian border .\nThe border guards ensured that they \u201e did not know the reason for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ban was issued for a period of three years .\nSuch measure only adds to the wide range of possible tools used to deal with those dangerous to the systematic flow .\nTransnational repression goes beyond already mentioned examples .\nFor instance , in quite distinction from the mentioned above , Russian citizens from the Chechen Republic , a province located in the North Caucasus , face a total campaign of transnational repression directed by provincial leader Ramzan Kadyrov , with the approval of the Russian central government .\nEven in exile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nStarting in 2009 , when two assassinations were executed , a brutal pattern began and has not stopped ever since .\nChechen dissidents abroad have been killed and attacked at alarming rate .\nTo prove the transnational relation , in 2016 , two Chechens living in Turkey , Ruslan Israpilov and Abdulwahid Edelgiriev , were killed by people later identified by international media outlets as Russian agents .\nAnd in December 2021 , a court in Germany sentenced Russian Vadim Krasikov , aka Vadim Sokolov , accused of the murder of former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life imprisonment , while agreeing with the investigation , which is sure that the murder was ordered by the Russian state .\nThe German Foreign Ministry also announced on Wednesday the expulsion of two employees of the Russian embassy in connection with the murder .\nBesides all of the extreme repression that Chechens face at home , finding asylum in Europe has become quite a task for many individuals as Chechen militancy is usually pictured negatively and bounded to international terrorism , due to their wars for independence and insurgency against Russia .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very controversial position , which not only covers the case of Chechens but with other countries as well : while recognizing the extremely harsh nature of dictator \u2019 s rule in a specific country , they frequently deny giving asylum to people , trying to flee it .\nWorst part is the return to the originating country after trying to flee its brutal regime .\nProtesters gathering after the killing of vocal Chechen government critic Martin Beck .\n( freedomhouse.org ) The transnational repression has been out there for many years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , digitalized and even more brutal network has been achieving new standards of opponents \u2019 elimination .\nClosely tighten security services go beyond the borders of specific country and reaches out far more than one could expect .\nThe international response , including such influential bodies as NATO and the European Union , to this alerting issue is usually atypical : only highprofile , most brutal incidents typically lead to clear consequences for the perpetrator .\nDespite the fact , that most outrageous examples are outside the European Union , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after protecting its own people , stand up to prevent further tragic accidents in the surrounding hostile neighborhood .\nNowadays , European Union is quite silent about the actions of the aggressors and hardly takes any specific actions to stop the ongoing brutal actions within the context of transnational repression .\nSeeing the negligence of the EU , together with other organizations , dictators are left with all the possibilities to continue the hunt of vocal dissidents .\nEven though the transnational repression is hard to track by design , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America seems to be in a leading position considering the tracking of \u201c politically motivated reprisals against individuals located outside the country \u201d .\nState Department , with its issued reports , has shown increasing interest considering this specific issue , although , it still lacks particular actions .\nIn order to stop the bodies of anti-regime activists piling up , European Union must confront the aggressors and hold them accountable for their brutal activities .\nThe article was prepared for publication by volunteers of the Res Publica \u2013 Civic Resilience Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exclusively for Res Publica .\nLukas Andriukaitis is an

"content": "This material was prepared for the readers of the InformNapalm volunteer intelligence community website by Yevhen Hriniov , a participant in the Russian-Ukrainian war .\nOn January 6 , 2022 , a military contingent from the CSTO rapid response forces was deployed to the Republic of Kazakhstan .\nAccording to InformNapalm , the Russian part of the task force included Russian units that participated in the aggression against Ukraine .\nThe task force supporting the intrastate coup in Kazakhstan , committed by Kassym-Jomart Tokayev , included the military units of the Russian Federation , Belarus , Armenia , Tajikistan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the CSTO military contingent in Kazakhstan is still unknown ; however it could be estimated at around 3000 men .\nThe core of the task force is made up of the Airborne Forces of the Russian Federation ( in various sources , their number has been announced from 2500 to 3600 people ) .\nNote that this is approximately equal to the strength of an air-assault brigade of the Russian Army .\nAccording to the Russian Ministry of Defense , a total of seventy Il-76 and several An-124 transport aircraft were involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aircraft from Pskov , Tver , Orenburg , Seshcha , Ivanovo , Ulyanovsk and Taganrog were used .\nNote that 70 planes approximately make the number of all fully operational Il-76 \u2019 s in the Russian Federation .\nIt is about the number of aircraft that , according to the Russian Ministry of Defense , was involved in the deployment of \u201c peacekeepers \u201d in the part of Karabakh that remained under the control of Armenia after the victory of Azerbaijan in the fall of 2020 ( 60 aircraft ) .\nBack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry an approximate set of equipment of one brigade and about 2,000 men .\nIf the aircraft numbers are reliable , this indicates that the operational readiness of the military transport aviation ( MTA ) fleet of the Russian Federation reaches 70 % , which is high even for developed countries .\nFor example , the operational readiness ratio of the French A-400 \u2019 s as of 2021 was only at 35 % .\nWe are interested in the capabilities of the Russian Army for a prompt airlift and deployment of a rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us try to make an estimation based on the standards for pre-flight handling and checks of the Il-76 type aircraft and the time frames according to 1996 standards of the Russian Airborne Forces for loading and unloading a paratrooper platoon .\nWe understand that it is an approximate estimation and the available information is incomplete , but we are quite capable of outlining the time and technical parameters with satisfactory tolerance acceptable for military planning .\nThe calculation will be made for the case of air landing operations ( the probability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to zero in modern combat conditions ) , and for a typical load of 3 BMD fighting vehicles or BTR-D armored personnel carriers per each Il-76 transport aircraft ( theoretically , loading up to 4 fighting vehicles is allowed , but no real cases have been recorded to date ) .\nFor all loading stages , we adopt \u201c satisfactory \u201d compliance with standards , as it is practically unrealistic to perform better in case of massive airlift effort by a joint air group .\nSo , the loading consists of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the control line : 19 minutes per platoon , based on 3-5 identified deficiencies ; \u2022 materiel loading and tiedown : up to 1 hour 50 minutes per 3 vehicles ; \u2022 pre-flight check of correct loading and rigging : up to 12 minutes per 3 vehicles .\nIn total , the maximum acceptable time for loading a paratrooper platoon with armored vehicles can be 2 hours and 20 minutes .\nLet us assume the flight duration of 3 hours .\nThe time to unload the equipment and make it combat-ready should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full cycle of transportation of 1 airborne platoon with equipment on an Il-76 aircraft is 6 hours and 20 minutes ( let us introduce the term \u201c block hour \u201d for further use ) .\nAdditionally , we must take into account the pre-flight checks and ground handling of an aircraft , which is approximately 2 hours ( depending on the airfield , weather conditions , the need to replace the crew , the need to check particular components , etc .\nAccording to the standards , it is from 97 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ferry flight , which also requires pre-flight preparations .\nIn total , the approximate time is 7 hours .\nThus , the transportation of one platoon requires at least 13 block hours .\nAccordingly , at least 39 block hours are required to transport a company with materiel .\nTo simplify the calculation and taking into account the absence of accurate information about the numbers of the \u201c peacekeeping \u201d contingent , we assume that up to 15 companies ( up to 1,500 people ) with standard armored vehicles will be involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconnaissance , communications , electronic warfare , technical support , etc . )\nconstitute approximately the same numbers .\nThe 1/1 ratio of combat and support units is generally accepted for rapid deployment operations .\nThus , the transportation of these forces requires approximately 1170 block hours .\nIt can be counter-argued that this assumption is made on an airlift operation carried out without interruption , with no regard given to the return ferry flights and pre-flight checks of the aircraft .\nAnd , given our lack of information , the operational readiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 100 % , which is unattainable in live conditions .\nWe also assume that there are replacement crews for round-the-clock operation of the aircraft , and the weather conditions are constantly favorable .\nYet , the available photos prove the long ground time of the fleet , at least in the airports of Kazakhstan .\nThe raised loading ramps indicate that the aircraft are not in the process of unloading or loading .\nThus , to ensure the transportation of the aforementioned forces by 70 Il-76 aircraft in round-the-clock mode , approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the TASS agency , the deployment of the task force was completed on January 9 , which means , it actually took 3 days .\nThis is quite consistent with the above calculation , taking into account the fact that the operation was actually non-combat in nature , there was a full cycle of standard pre-flight checks , probably no replacement crews were used , etc .\nA similar time was required for the mentioned above deployment of the Russian brigade in the Armenian-occupied part of Karabakh in 2020 .\nArguably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ground forces or airborne forces with the use of all operational IL-76 available in Russia is approximately 3 days , but can be reduced to 1 day in a critical situation , under appropriate weather conditions and with simplified pre-flight ground operations .\nHowever , this does not mean that the Russian military transport aviation is able to carry out the transfer of 10 airborne brigades within 10 days , since an operation of this scale will be affected by the accumulation of technical irregularities , crew fatigue , logistics chain errors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ?\nOn the one hand , calculations and practice show that the mobility and threat of the simultaneous use of the Russian Airborne Forces is greatly exaggerated by the Russian propaganda .\nThe entire military transport aviation of the Russian Federation will not be able to ensure the transfer of just one airborne division even within 2 or 3 days , not to mention its simultaneous landing .\nThe above calculations also did not take into account the transportation of tanks , artillery and other weapons in service with Russian airborne divisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build-up of Russian rapid deployment forces at a maximum rate of up to 4 brigades in 3-4 days , using their own front-line airfields or captured adversary airfields , is a factor that can radically change the balance of forces in a critical area , where regular mechanized units have been previously deployed .\nHere we refer to the present concentration of Russian tank forces in Klintsy , Bryansk

chemical weapons by the Ukrainian army against residents of the DPR .\nOn December 24 , 2021 , after the release of information about the interception of the report , all activities related to the release of fakes about \u201c chemical weapons \u201d and \u201c US private military companies \u201d were put on hold .\nThe reason for suspension : if the documents were intercepted , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously prepared materials were compromised and could be disclosed .\nAnd this will lead to the opposite consequences on the international arena than those that the Kremlin was counting on .\nTherefore , the topic of the \u201c chemical attack \u201d was put on pause .\nOn January 6 , Russia started transferring airborne and special forces units to Kazakhstan .\nInternational negotiations were also underway , so the Kremlin was temporarily not up to inciting the next stage of \u201c chemical provocations \u201d .\nLet \u2019 s hope that the proactive publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defense Intelligence will also affect Moscow \u2019 s actions because the whole world is closely watching every step of the Russian Federation both near the borders of Ukraine and in the occupied territories .\nIn 2019 , the Ukrainian Ministry for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories reported that the Russian occupation administration closed down Concern Stirol in Horlivka and tons of hazardous chemicals were stored there .\nAccording to the Ministry , several dozens of tons of hazardous chemicals were stored at the enterprise during 2018 , at the beginning of 2018 @ @ @ @

remember the Maidan once a year , on the anniversary of the Revolution of Dignity .\nPunishing those who gave and performed criminal orders requires public attention every day .\nProceedings against some thugs who criminally abused Maidan protesters can be closed due to the statute of limitation .\nTo avoid this , the Ukrainian public and the international community must pay attention to the Maidan cases .\nInformNapalm volunteer intelligence community , will be publishing digests of materials prepared by the Advocacy Advisory Panel ( a group of lawyers engaged in Maidan Cases ) in English on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highlights of Maidan court proceedings .\nFurthermore , the original article in Ukrainian provides numerous further examples of the procrastination of court proceedings by officers , policemen , and thugs accused of savage beatings , torture , and murders of protesters , as well as by their defenders .\nThere are indications of the forbearance of these tactics on the part of many judges .\nThe conduct of judges is especially egregious in the cases of [ Ed : Ukrainian judges who passed illegal decisions against the Maidan protesters ] and related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ministry of Interior .\nWe also want to invite your attention to the arrest of Dzianis Ivashyn , a member of our volunteer community from Belarus and participant of the Revolution of Dignity in

court proceedings ) .\nThere was some progress in 38 court proceedings .\nAs usual , there were a number of delays .\nSome court sessions could not take place in December for usual reasons , such as the failure of the accused and their defenders to appear ( e. g. , due to \u201c business trips \u201d ) , because of illnesses and vacations of the judges , the involvement of judges into other processes , or notices from courts postponing the case review by almost half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this .\nis a monthly analytical digest .\nHere you can find detailed information about the process of court proceedings in # MaidanCases in December 2021 .\nThe factual and statistical information about the process of proceedings is grouped by episodes .\nFollow the links in the text to find detailed information about specific proceedings and court sessions .\nIn December , the Supreme Court made a decision on an important # MaidanCase by upholding the sentence of the runaway ex-President Viktor Yanukovych\u201413 years of imprisonment for the crime of high treason .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that found Yanukovych guilty in spite of numerous attempts by the defense to disrupt proceedings and drag the case .\nIn December , the Sviatoshyn Court had a number of meaningful sessions in the case of # ShootingOnInstytutska .\nFirst , being petitioned by the defense , the court reviewed the video footage of the interview of Oleksandr Revazishvili , a so-called \u201c rebuttal witness \u201d or , according to the lawyer representing the victims , an actor ; he promoted a fake version of the involvement of the \u201c Georgian sharpshooters \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordinated by Mamuka Mamulashvili .\nLater on , the court examined Mamuka Mamulashvili , who offered a very convincing rebuttal of the myth about the so-called Georgian sharpshooters and , as we hope , put the full stop to this fake story .\nThe examination of Maksym Andreyev , who described the circumstances of the fatal wound suffered by Ihor Pekhenko , was quite important as well .\nIn December , the court also examined civil claims .\nThe stance of the Ministry of Interior as the defendant in the civil proceedings was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative in the court stated that the Ministry of Interior could not be held liable for the actions of militia officers because the militia , which perpetrated crimes on the Maidan , does not exist anymore after the police reform .\nHowever , this representative failed to mention that one of the units of this purportedly \u201c new \u201d police is similar to the squad and gives shelter to many officers accused and suspected of being implicated in Maidan cases .\nThe long-lasting procedure in # PasichnykCase with regard to recognizing the son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his civil case came to an end in December as well .\nSuch recognition would enable Denys Pasichnyk and his representative to take part in the proceedings , but judge Omelian denied the recognition .\nDefenders in the case were coming up with various reasons for the postponement of the examination of the case in the court , and the court has sided with the defense at all times .\nAs a result , the critically important 9 months were lost in this case , which is very close to the expiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process is one of the most egregious examples of dilatory tactics and judicial leniency .\nWithdrawal of the Driver \u2019 s License for a Trip to Mezhyhirya on December 29 , 2013 # KytsiukCase\u2014The Kyiv Court of Appeal was supposed to consider the notice of appeal by Roman Maselko , a representative of victims in the case , against the sentence for judge Viktor Kytsiuk .\nHe issued decisions to withdraw the drivers \u2019 licenses of Avtomaidan protesters for their trips to Mezhyhirya .\nThe panel of judges was chaired by judge Mykola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the High Council of Justice , who voted for appointing Kytsiuk a judge for life on December 3 , 2020 .\nAt that time , Khudyk believed that Kytsiuk \u2019 s reputation had been impeccable and that he had been able to administer justice until retirement .\nJudge Khudyk scheduled a meeting but then remembered his own involvement in considering Kytsiuk \u2019 s case in the High Council of Justice and recused himself .\nFor more detail , please see Roman Maselko \u2019 s Find out How and Why Maidan Judges Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a new panel of judges was set up automatically .\nHowever , Roman Maselko , a representative of the victims , had to motion for disqualification of two judges from the panel , Andrii Dryha , and Viktor Gabriel .\nThey kept in

assembly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activists on the basis of the knowingly false documents ( falsified evidence ) and by withdrawing their driver \u2019 s licenses ; Stepanova and Shalapuda are also accused of tampering with the automated case allocation system of the court .\nAlthough Roman Maselko , a representative of the victims , requested the court to postpone the case review for a valid reason , judge Rodionov decided that the inability of the representative to be at the court session did not constitute a ground for the postponement , and the accused were examined without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer

proceedings by requesting Denys to be personally present at the session , then the documents from his sister , and then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure that she did not wish to succeed in the case .\n\u201c Obviously , the decision has been made long ago , but it took the judge 9 months to rule .\nNine long months\u2026 It was done to extend the proceedings as much as possible , rather than to

Svitlana Volkova , judge of the Pechersk Court , changed the measure of restraint to 24/7 house arrest instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s office made an attempt to appeal against this decision , but the court of appeal had not received all the case materials by December 22 .\nThus , Spasskikh was released from custody .\n# LukashCase On December 8 , the Darnytsia Court examined two victims in the case of Vladyslav Lukash , commander from Kharkiv .\nOleh Krupa , a victim , told the court that he had been on Maidan from December 10 till February 18 .\nHe was severely injured during the peaceful march on February 18 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ us .\nThe people there were squashed and started falling down .\nWe approached the people to help them stand up , but the Berkut started pulling us away one by

.\nOn December 1 , the Sviatoshyn Court announced civil claims by the victims against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine .\nAs expected , defenders of the accused voiced their objections .\nAnton Shchepanskyi , a representative of the Ministry of Interior , stated that the Ministry did not recognize the claims in full .\nAccording to him , the Ministry of Interior was reformed after the Maidan so that the Ministry can not be held liable for the actions of militiamen , including officers , because there is no militia in existence , but there is the police .\n\u201c With its Resolution , the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interior of Ukraine , including its Directorate in Kyiv City .\nThe Ministry of Interior of Ukraine is not a legal successor to the agency to be liquidated and can not be held liable for actions of the third parties , including officers of the Directorate of the Ministry of Interior of Ukraine in Kyiv City \u201d , Anton Shchepanskyi stated .\nYou can

, the court examined a witness Maksym Andreyev .\nMaksym is a young guy from Melitopol .\nHe came to the Maidan a day before .\nHe witnessed the fatal injury to Ihor Pekhenko and evacuated him to the Main Post Office .\nHe was not familiar with Pekhenko and did not know whether he survived or not , in spite of a number of attempts .\nIn several years , the witness recognized himself on a photo made during the evacuation of Pekhenko and published on Facebook .\nAndreyev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wounded on Instytutska and that he saw law enforcement officers in the black uniform with yellow armbands and automatic rifles .\n\u201c People started going up the hill on Instytutska Street toward the timepiece .\nI also climbed it .\nI saw that a man was wounded in the buttock who rolled downhill .\nThen we climbed over a metal fence , and a man named Ihor , who was sitting to my left , told us not to worry and that everything was going to be fine .\nHe held a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told something incomprehensible and started leaning on me .\nI saw blood under his sweater \u201d , Maksym Andreyev told .\nAccording to him , the man was wounded to the chest .\nMaksym and Ihor were sitting next to one another on the corner of the October Palace ( closer to the Maidan ) near the stairs .\nWe were hiding behind the shields .\nAt this moment , the law enforcement officers in the black uniform with yellow armbands and AK rifles were near the columns of the October Palace .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ request of Yevheniia Zakrevska , a lawyer representing the victims .\nAt the same session , the court viewed the video footage of an interview of Oleksandr Revazishvili in Belarus with the lawyer Oleksandr Horoshynskyi .\ndefenders have been promoting the fake narrative of so-called \u201c Georgian sharpshooters \u201d who fired at people on February 20 .\nRevazishvili claimed to have been one of these sharpshooters .\nThe victims consider him to be a fake witness .\nThe public prosecution office provided evidence that Revazishvili had not been to Ukraine at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , on February 20 .\nYou can view the video stream of this interview On December 22 , the myth of the \u201c Georgian sharpshooters \u201d was fully debunked in the court .\nThe court examined Mamuka Mamulashvili as a witness .\nRevazishvili claimed that Mamuka Mamulashvili had organized the arrival of Revazishvili and other Georgian sharpshooters in Ukraine .\nSeveral films used by defenders to justify the need for the examination of the \u201c Georgian sharpshooters \u201d in the court claimed that Mamuka had played this role during the events .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the so-called Georgian sharpshooters and his stay in Ukraine during the events on the Maidan .\nHe was quite ironic about Revazishvili as a \u201c witness \u201d and other actors in the film : \u201c The people in the film are actors who have not been cast properly .\nFirstly , they don \u2019 t look like the military .\nSecondly , they speak Georgian with such a thick accent that one can hear at once that they lived in Russia for a long time \u201d , the witness stated .\nMamuka Mamulashvili @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine during the Maidan .\nHe only came to Ukraine in late April 2014 to train the Ukrainian soldiers taking part in defending Ukraine \u2019 s territory against Russian aggression .\nBefore that , Mamuka Mamulashvili visited Ukraine once in June 2013 , representing the Georgian Mixed Martial Arts Federation at the European Championship .\nThis statement is evidenced by his passport and Facebook posts demonstrated in the court .\nMamuka Mamulashvili referred to the film about the \u201c sharpshooters \u201d as a total fake .\nAnd he demonstrated this convincingly in court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the film \u2019 s authors , starting with the unprofessional casting of actors who played the role of \u201c sharpshooters\u2026 \u201d \u201c There are several fat guys claiming to be my sharpshooters .\nThis is quite funny .\nI can show you the real sharpshooters from the Georgian legion .\nThese guys can walk up to 60 km in a day \u201d .\n\u2026and finishing with the ID cards demonstrated by the so-called \u201c sharpshooters \u201d to the cameraman .\nThese are not only fake documents with grammar mistakes but also they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not exist in Georgia .\n\u201c There are several grammar mistakes .\nThe ID cards in this booklet format have not been in use in Georgia since 2004 .\nWe are using plastic ID cards \u201d , the witness stated .\nMamulashvili \u2019 s testimony puts the final nail in the coffin of the legend about the Georgian sharpshooters .\nAt the end of the examination , the defenders started doubting the fact that their \u201c witness \u201d Revazishvili had been referring to the right Mamuka , insinuating that there might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those things described by Revazishvili to the Belarusian public prosecution office .\nHowever , there is an image of Mamuka Mamulashvili in the fake movie , with which the defense claimed it was necessary to examine the \u201c Georgian sharpshooters.\n\u201d It was the image of the man who was actually examined in the court .\nThe court made sure that this was the right person by reviewing the screenshots from the movie .\nYou can view the video stream of this session Please also see Stas

Zavorotnyi failed to appear at the court on December 14 .\nThey referred to the bail hearing of one of their clients scheduled in the High Anti-Corruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere coincidence \u201d that all the three Zavorotnyi \u2019 s lawyers were defending the same suspect .\nOne more attorney claimed sickness but failed to provide any documentary evidence .\nOleksii Donskyi , the public

Russia of the aggression of Ukraine and NATO , whipping up hysteria and panic , and wreaking havoc to achieve its military-political goals .\nThe real reasons for Putin \u2019 s hysteria are probably the fear that his aggressive plans and intentions to take over Ukraine will fail .\nAs of December 2021 , the majority of Ukrainians support the course towards Ukraine \u2019 s accession to NATO , and

formal resignation as President of the Republic of Kazakhstan and his replacement by Kassym-Jomart Tokayev , a dependent lightweight lacking the political heft ( the so-called transition of power . )\nIt is this corrupt regime that is justifiably accused of deteriorating living standards of the majority of Kazakhs , especially in recent years [ 3 ] ( in 2021 , inflation reached 10.9 % , the debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % , official unemployment increased by 12 % , exclusive of domestic and external migrants . )\n\u2022 On the morning of January 5 , the puppet president Tokayev made substantial concessions , settling for dismissal of the government , and return to state regulation of gas prices .\nIn some regions , a state of emergency was declared [ 4 ] .\n\u2022 Despite the concessions and the imposition of a state of emergency , the protest movement radicalizes , and the protesters seize a number of government buildings .\nRussian propagandists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and compare the akimat ( mayor \u2019 s office ) burned in Almaty [ 5 ] with the Trade Unions House in Odesa [ 6 ] .\nIt becomes obvious that law enforcers in Kazakhstan can not control the protests .\nAlmaty Airport is seized [ 7 ] amid rumors of the redeployment of troops from Russia , Almaty Commandant reports discovery of headless corpses of law enforcement officers [ 8 ] ( most likely , in order to anger the law enforcers against the civilians . )\nIn parallel with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene .\nThe aggressive nature of the confrontations , as well as the pogroms , are explained by a significant numbers of unemployed young men ( the average age of the population in Kazakhstan is 31 years [ 9 ] ) , which together makes the nature of the protest more similar to the Arab Spring events than the \u201c color revolutions \u201d in the post-Soviet countries .\n\u2022 On the evening of January 5 , President Tokayev arbitrarily takes over as head of the Security Council of Kazakhstan ( the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ 10 ] , and announces the start of a counter-terrorism operation against \u201c terrorists trained outside the country and orchestrated by a single center \u201c .\nFor this operation , he requests the intervention of forces of the Collective Security Treaty Organization ( CSTO ) members \u2013 the Russian Federation , Belarus , Kyrgyzstan , and Armenia .\nThere are two important points to note here .\nFirstly , Tokayev , apparently pulled off a classic \u201c silent coup \u201d with the support of foreign invaders .\nSecondly , the military intervention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as evidenced by a number of indirect factors : an abrupt change in Tokayev \u2019 s rhetoric , from concessions to the military operation , within one day ; the nature of the Russian airlift effort involving 70 transport aircraft ( almost all the existing military transport aviation fleet ) ; sending an official notice to the UN ( required by the CSTO Charter for \u201c peacekeeping operations \u201d ) only on January 7 [ 11 ] , i. e. 2 days after the start of the operation .\nIt is notable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote in English on his Twitter page about \u201c 20,000 terrorists , some speaking foreign languages , who had attacked Almaty \u201d [ 12 ] , but later deleted the post .\n\u2022 The CSTO \u201c peacekeepers \u201d , whose number is insufficient for such intervention ( up to 6,000 in total ) , are officially engaged in securing the critical infrastructure [ 13 ] , and are not involved in the counter-terrorism operation ( CTO ) announced by Tokayev .\nIn fact , this contingent is trying to legitimize the coup committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human shield in the event of a revolt of the Kazakh law enforcers or military .\n\u2022 From January 6 to 10 , the \u201c CTO \u201d in Kazakhstan continues , the pockets of resistance are gradually crushed , and usurper Tokayev gives an order to shoot to kill the protesters without warning .\nAt the same time , the official version as to the performer of the \u201c terrorist attacks \u201d on Kazakhstan turned on a dime from the search for foreign influence ( think about the absurd detention of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to a formal protest lodged by the Kyrgyz government [ 15 ] , and the deletion of Tokaev \u2019 s English tweets about \u201c terrorists \u201d , which he perceived as official statements for the West [ 16 ] ) to the statement about a \u201c coup d \u2019 etat attempt \u201d , with the detention of the chairman of Kazakhstan \u2019 s National Security Committee ( KNB ) , Karim Massimov [ 17 ] , and the dismissal of several security officials from among Nazarbayev \u2019 s relatives .\nNazarbayev himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no official statement from him .\nDespite rumors of Nazarbayev \u2019 s escape abroad , death , or being critically ill , on January 7 , Alexander Lukashenko says he had a phone conversation with Nazarbayev , adding another surreal dimension to the situation [ 18 ] .\n\u2022 It is the coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat attempt that becomes an official version both in Kazakhstan and for the CSTO members [ 19 ] [ 20 ] \u2013 the leaders of the CSTO member countries confirm this at their joint online summit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , in order to mask the undoubted fact that the CSTO intervened in the internal conflict , they constantly talk of some \u201c external forces that wanted to take advantage of the situation [ 22 ] \u201d , while nobody names their countries of origin and the nature of the intervention .\nAccording to Putin , the greatest sin was \u201c the use of Maidan technologies [ 23 ] \u201d , which of course required immediate military intervention .\nGiven all of the above , we can proceed to the conclusions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s special operation in Kazakhstan and , most importantly , about its consequences , especially in the long term .\nWhat really happened in Kazakhstan ?\nThe massive scale and radical nature of the protest obviously came as a complete surprise to everyone in Kazakhstan and abroad .\nIt is evidenced by both the absence of official comments until the evening of January 5 , and the failure to take preventive action to deter or put down the protests .\nThe most probable reasons could be the struggle for power between Nazarbayev \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the puppet ruler Tokayev , and general confusion caused by the lack of reliable information about the protests , which resulted in a delay of a sweeping crackdown on the protest during the first days .\nHowever , the unexpected support of Tokayev from Russia can be explained only by Putin \u2019 s irrational and panicky fear of the \u201c \u201c .\nThis fear turned out to be so strong that Putin betrayed Nazarbayev and became an accomplice of the silent coup on the side of the official who was supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s immunity .\nFor the sake of comparison , let \u2019 s imagine the Putin-Medvedev tandem ( which , in its time , was similar to the Nazarbayev-Tokayev one ) , where Medvedev involves foreign troops to fight Putin and his loyal officials .\nBesides , in order to fight the \u201c Maidan \u201d and preserve the privileged status of his sacred position of the nation \u2019 s President , Putin will have to keep Tokayev in office and support the elimination of Nazarbayev \u2019 s loyalists from Kazakhstan \u2019 s state apparatus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clan wars never benefit the economic development , which means that the preconditions for future protests remain in force .\nFor Russia , it further implies either granting fresh credits to Kazakhstan or the need to expand its military presence in this country .\nThe long-term consequences of this dizzying \u201c Drive to the East \u201d ( German : \u201c Drang nach Osten \u201d ) don \u2019 t look good for the Russian Federation .\n\u2022 The CSTO has become a de facto on-call service for the dictators of the post-Soviet countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protests by proxy , or use foreign troops in their own clan wars .\nIn this regard , the organization may expand at the expense of corrupt gerontocracies that fear for their future ( Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , etc . )\n, thus forming a dubious foundation for rebuilding the perverse new version of USSR 2.0 , which is ardently desired by the Russian leadership .\nHowever , the integration will be extremely formal , since the dictators now have every reason to fear that their own retinue may push the \u201c call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say the magic word \u201c Maidan \u201d .\n\u2022 Both Putin and Lukashenko will kling to their presidencies until death .\nAt the same time , the security apparatus , as the sole support of the regime in their countries , will get more and more power , intensely using strong-arm tactics to prevent any attempt to protest .\nThat will significantly deepen their isolation from the West , even to the point of raising a new Iron Curtain .\n\u2022 Such a striking example of illogical interference in other countries \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful negotiations with the United States on security guarantees and delimitation of spheres of influence .\nSimilarly , the cost of Russian intervention in Ukraine will significantly increase .\nThe Russian regime is turning into a toxic tyranny with a hysterical leader at the controls unable to cope with his own phobias .\n\u2022 Russia has opened \u201c Pandora \u2019 s box \u201d not only for the CSTO member countries .\nThis approach can now be used by odious regimes all over the world \u2013 they only need to set up an international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones .\n\u2022 Most importantly , a similar approach can now be used against Russia .\nParticular attention should be paid to the fact that on January 8 , China offered assistance to Kazakhstan within the framework of the SCO \u2019 s ( Shanghai Cooperation Organization ) charter [ 24 ] .\nWhat will prevent China from \u201c extending the hand of friendship \u201d to Russia ( also an SCO member ) , should any forces appear in Russia that want to take advantage of the old age , weakness or illness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar coup ?\nRead also other related materials

Belarus announced that a strong protest was delivered to the Ambassador of Ukraine Ihor Kyzym \u201c in connection with the purposeful launch of an unmanned aerial vehicle from Ukraine to the territory of Belarus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on January 24th .\nLet us hypothesize that the UAV was launched by Ukraine to monitor the actions of the Russian military at the Brestsky training grounds .\nAccording to the events timeline , the UAV was launched a day before the arrival of the first Russian specil trains in Brest and long before the start of the maneuvers , which makes no sense for military reconnaissance .\nAlso the question arises , why both the Belarusian Foreign Ministry and ATN propagandists were silent about the incident until February 3 ?\nAnd why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start on the same day when Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu arrived in Minsk to meet Lukashenka ?\nIt is also noteworthy that the ATN story with the photo of the UAV was published about 20 minutes after the report on the meeting with Lukashenka \u2019 s bellicose quote : \u201c They try to get in \u2013 they get a hiding !\nThat \u2019 s all the war.\n\u201d Meeting of Alexander Lukashenka and Sergei

some sources , as UJ-22 in others , some commentators also say that the model bears certain resemblance with Russian Orlan-10 .\nBut none of these models , neither Ukrainian , nor Russian or

involved in the war in the east of Ukraine , but are less experienced and informed about Ukrainian models of UAVs .\nTherefore , we turned for help to Yevhen Hriniov , a specialist who , for the past

drones .\nParticular attention should be paid to the \u201c air intake \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not how it is done in factory production settings .\nThis Looks like a \u201c do-it-yourself model \u201d made of parts purchased from online stores .\nIt could have been assembled and used by some smugglers , \u201d Yevhen Hriniov commented .\nAlso , looking at the specific features of the Ukrainian Spectator M1 ( which the propaganda channels of Belarus and Russia mostly indicate as the UAV \u2019 s model ) , we can clearly see that the wing mount and tail section and other structural elements differ from the model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February 3 was chosen by no coincidence as the date of a media provocation using a DIY drone ( found previously or deliberately brought to Belarus , possibly , with

spotted signs of a preparatory psychological operation ( PSYOP ) of the Russian Federation in the Donbas , which may precede a false flag offensive .\nRead more below in this article .\nOver the past

"informnapalm", "title": "Russia lagging behind in combat drone technologies and trying to hide it through information operations", "content": "In this analytical review , InformNapalm volunteer intelligence community offers our readers a brief analysis of Russian information operations around unmanned combat aerial vehicles ( UCAV ) amid Russia \u2019 s chronic lag in these technologies .\nThe review was prepared by Yevhen Hriniov , a participant in the Russian-Ukrainian war who has combat experience in the use and countering of UAVs .\nRussian UCAVs in a major information operation to cover up the chronic lag behind Western technologies For a long time , the Russian mass media and industry sources had promoted the position that UCAVs were unsuitable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had viewed them rather as a toy for military operations in third world countries .\nThis could be explained both by the conservative thinking of the Russian command , which was educated on the classical concepts dating back to the Cold War times , and by the complete inability of the Russian military-industrial complex to master the production of modern microelectronics .\nIn the pre-sanctions times , the problem was easily solved by imports .\nEven components of the Bulava missile or the K-433 submarine employed microprocessors from the Latvian company Alpha and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation for the Russian Federation has deteriorated sharply over the recent years .\nIn our operations in the Donbas , we shot down or forced to land multiple Russian reconnaissance UAVs like Forpost , Granat , Eleron , and Orlan .\nTheir examination revealed that almost all internal components of these UAVs , with the exception of the airframes and parachutes , were foreign-made civilian-grade products .\nFor example , Orlan has a Chinese-made GPS tracker , a US-made starter-generator PTN78020 from Texas Instruments Inc. , a Japanese-made engine from SAITO SEISAKUSHO CO. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European concern STMicroelectronics , and a US-made telemetry controller from Microchip .\nRussian drone Orlan-10 consists of parts produced in the USA and other countries \u2013 photo evidence Eleron has a microcontroller made by STMicroelectronics and photographic equipment assembled from parts of Sony and Olympus point-and-shoot cameras ( for more details look up the CAR report , as well as check the Military Review website ) .\nThe findings are clear : not a single type of Russian UAV captured in Ukraine or Syria had any Russian-made microelectronics .\nApparently , Russians are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFor example , back in 2020 , the government stopped funding the development of new processors .\nAt the same time , it is becoming more and more difficult to ignore the unchallenged success of Turkish UCAVs in Syria and more recently in the course of hostilities in Nagorno-Karabakh .\nThose Russians , who care about the development of their own aviation and the military-industrial complex , are concerned that Russia lags not only behind the United States , Israel and Turkey , but even behind the technical solutions of ISIS militants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extreme corruption , the government did not generate any meaningful demand for the development of promising UCAVs through defense orders ( new industries simply do not have a relevant domestic lobby ) , whereas private business in Russia is also unable to develop innovative technologies .\nRussia has wasted the time needed for research and development and is now unable to come up with anything competitive .\nHowever , at this point Russia can not admit it , having touted its military-industrial complex around the world .\nOn the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste ) significant budgets for development of UCAVs .\nSo it is no wonder that in the fall and early winter of 2021 there were exuberant reports in the Russian media about \u201c the success of the Russian military-industrial complex in the field of drone production.\n\u201d AO Kronstadt , a new manufacturer of UAVs , reported that they were ready to mass-produce unique ( ! )\nsmall-size UAVs Merak and Luman .\nThis kind of series production was indeed quite simple to set up , as these are repainted AtomRC Fixed Wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available for purchase on Ali Express .\nRussian media went into an overdrive on December 17-20 , 2021 .\nOne after another , news stories appeared about the tests of a \u201c drone killer \u201d based on the Orion UAV , the newest Okhotnik UAV ( \u201c the Hunter \u201d in Russian ) , the combat use of the Lancet kamikaze drones in Syria , the conferences in the Russian science hub Skolkovo .\nApparently , the purpose of these stories was to convince ordinary Russians that the Russian military-industrial complex was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even that Russia was \u201c at the forefront \u201d in the most advanced segment of fighter UAVs .\nIt should be noted that both ordinary Russians and those not-so-ordinary Russians who actually approve development budgets and state orders are not very technically literate , and they can be easily tricked by a glossy picture of \u201c grandeur \u201d .\nLet us take , for example , the Orion unmanned aircraft system ( UAS ) , which is known in the domestic market as Inokhodets ( \u201c the Ambler \u201d in Russian ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where two new production hangars with an area of 30 * 30 m each have recently been erected .\nDevelopment has been underway since 2011 , the first flight took place in 2016 ; since 2019 it has been in trial operation , which , however , began with a crash of the prototype .\nOn November 16 , 2019 , an Orion crashed during a test flight near residential buildings in the village of Listvyanka in the Ryazan Oblast .\nLocal residents took a photo of the incident and posted it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash was reported as \u201c equipment failure \u201d .\nIt is reported that this drone features a Russian-made optoelectronic reconnaissance station , whereas the latest modification spots a new radar cowling .\nThe engine is US-made , but they promise to have their analog soon .\nAccording to Russian experts , there really is such an engine in Russia , but its manufacturer is a private company , which is now being systematically strangled by the public sector .\nWe could assume that the state wants to take over the technology .\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the private Sokol Design Bureau ( now the Simonov Design Bureau ) , whose chief designer was imprisoned on trumped-up charges , and the developer of the RED A03/V12 engine V. Raikhlin emigrated to Germany .\nWithout going deep into the tactics of combat deployment of UCAVs , it should be noted that guided ammunition is at the core of their effectiveness .\nBroadly speaking , a UCAV is a high-precision instrument operating on the \u201c came-saw-hit \u201d principle .\nThe combination of the striking range , the ability to \u201c see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-precision guided ammunition \u2013 these are the key competitive components of UCAVs .\nLet us have a look at what the Russians have in this regard .\nAt first glance , the armament looks very solid , e.g .\nthe UPAB-50 gliding bomb , as well as the guided KAB-20 and KAB-50 bombs .\nAlong with these , there \u2019 s also a strange mention of the FAB-50 , a pre-WW2 technology .\nBut the main draw is the mysterious X-BPLA ( or X-UAV ) small-sized air-to-air missile .\nLet \u2019 s note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let \u2019 s return to the UPAB-50 .\nThis ammunition is positioned as an analog and competitor of the well-known Turkish guided ammunition of the MAM series .\nHowever , even a cursory glance at both ammunition types is enough to understand that most of the usable space inside the UPAB-50 housing is occupied by explosives , and autonomous homing systems have no place it its layout .\nConsequently , it will be controlled only by GPS ( its signal is easy to suppress even with DIY electronic warfare assets ) , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inertial system + active or passive laser aiming .\nHere we come to the age-old problem of the Russian Air Forces , which causes even the Su-34s in Syria to use unguided munitions : Russia lacks most of the modern guided ammunition types , and the available ones are very expensive , one of the main reasons being the small scale of their production .\nIt is unrealistic to claim that Russians could independently manage to miniaturize the guidance systems for smart ammunition ( by the way , MAM stands for Mini Ak\u0131ll\u0131 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Munition in English ) .\nOf course , there is no public conversation about it in Russia .\nEven demonstrating full-scale models of their guided UCAV munitions is tricky , since obvious manipulations can be immediately spotted and exposed even on Russian military forums ( despite the real danger of getting a prison sentence for \u201c disclosure of state secrets \u201d or \u201c extremism in social media \u201d ) .\nRussia badly needs a quick fix .\nSo , Inokhodets was urgently relabeled a \u201c drone hunter \u201d .\nLet \u2019 s see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 , a news story and a video was circulated through Russian web sites and Telegram channels focused on this subject , showing an Orion with two ATGMs mounted on its hardpoints ( which is critically few for a UCAV ) shooting down an unmanned helicopter target at the testing range in Crimea .\nAnd here we come to the most interesting part \u2013 the mysterious X-UAV missile is actually the Kornet-D , an ATGM which has been mounted on helicopters in Russia for a while to engage high-value ground targets .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting two ATGMs on a UCAV , allowing for a successful demonstration with a live launch and a hit .\nHowever , this demonstration also raises many inconvenient questions : \u2022 how would Orion capture the target in combat conditions when a Bayraktar is not detectable at the distances that are within the range of its own weapons ?\n\u2022 How will the system hold the target with its laser beam if the target is constantly moving , and would do additional maneuvering having sensed laser irradiation ?\n\u2022 If there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled by wire , does the manufacturer remember about the maximum angular velocity of the target at which it is possible to aim ?\n\u2022 If the manufacturer equips the Kornet rockets with a television guidance module , how much will each rocket cost ?\nThe airspace of modern conflicts teems with much more than just Bayraktars .\nA very simple Ukrainian Leleka drone directing artillery fire can be no less dangerous .\nHowever , the price of a Leleka is 20-30 times less than of one Kornet-D rocket , and they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rockets .\nWe will not even compare the specifications of the X-UAV with the Turkish guided bombs .\nIn addition to the obvious factors like prohibitively high cost and shorter range , there are many as things that are of significance to experts .\nFor example , the launcher container of the X-UAV remains on the carrier after the launch , reducing its flight performance .\nThe rocket has no all-aspect capability .\nFinally , the altitude requirements for the effective use of the rocket forces the carrier to venture into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas Bayraktars do not have this flaw .\nThis rocket was designed for use on attack helicopters to defeat armored vehicles and high-value targets , and the tactics of attack helicopters is fundamentally different from that of UCAVs .\nThe day before the demonstration of the \u201c Bayraktor killer \u201d , Russian TV showed the wreckage of the aforementioned UCAV .\nInitially , they planned a high-profile information operation , where these debris were supposed to have been \u201c found \u201d on the territory of the occupied areas of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense of the \u201c proud young republics \u201d ( read : Russia ) easily avenged the howitzers hit by a Bayraktar and \u201c that the sky is secured \u201d .\nHowever , the Ukrainian intelligence and special operations forces anticipated the move , so the Russians had to make do with just media reports without any field work .\nThey \u2022 showed fragments of some Bayraktar on TV \u2022 demonstrated a rocket launch from an Orion at a target at a testing range , \u2022 hinted that the footage is somehow related .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the details : even Russian aviation enthusiasts saw that the debris on display belonged to the first-generation Bayraktar , which has not been in operation for several years .\nWithin the framework of the same media campaign , the very next day , the footage of an Okhotnik heavy UCAV firing its weapons was released .\nThe drone looks massive , apparently featuring some stealth technologies , it is outwardly similar to the Lockheed Martin RQ-170 Sentinel ( which entered combat operation approximately in 2009 ) .\nThe demonstration left the impression that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area of reproducing other countries \u2019 twenty-year-old designs .\nGiven the fact that ten years ago a RQ-170 was lost by the Americans in Afghanistan and then fell into the hands of Iran , one could expect a decent job at reverse engineering of the basic hardware , however not of the electronics .\nWe will not speculate about real combat capabilities of the Okhotnik .\nBut let \u2019 s have a look at the video from December 19 .\nIt \u2019 s a testing range again , \u201c a live use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newest heavy combat drone equipped with stealth technology and advanced radars drops\u2026 a Soviet FAB-500 unguided bomb designed in 1950s .\nNo more comments needed here .\nThe lame media spin with Orion and Okhotnik coincided with a stream of news from Skolkovo about civilian taxi drones , unmanned air mail of the future , concepts of urban air mobility , and , of course , about \u201c artificial intelligence \u201d .\nRussia , most likely , will try to get components for mass drone production by bypassing sanctions under the guise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should admit that Russia demonstrated a successful use of kamikaze drones in Syria in 2020 .\nThe footage looked realistic and the operation went well .\nHowever , it \u2019 s been a year since the end of the war in Nagorno-Karabakh , but apart from the Lancet kamikaze drone , Russia has been able to come up only with firing an ATGM at a target at a testing range , dropping of an ancient unguided bomb from a supposedly \u201c ultramodern combat drone \u201d and the wreckage of an outdated Bayraktar model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kyrgyzstan ( a CSTO member state ) is buying Bayraktars .\nIn Ukraine , a plant is being rapidly built to produce both Bayraktars and the much more advanced and powerful Akinci UCAVs .\nFinally , with the help of Ukraine , Turkey has come close to creating a jet-powered UCAV , and unlike Russia the Turks have suitable ammunition for it .\nThe United States and Great Britain are actively developing drone swarm technologies which would render any of the existing air defense systems ineffective .\nRecently , the Rapid Dragon technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other guided munitions could be dropped for combat deployment from C-130 and other standard NATO airlifters on special pallets .\nIt has been announced that the next generation of the Dragon will be unmanned .\nTheir artificial intelligence for fighter aircraft munitions is being live-tested on the F-35s .\nAt the same time , the use of unguided ammunition is rapidly becoming a thing of the past even in the mainstream military aviation because the scale of the serial production and sophistication of technologies makes it more cost effective to hit a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is mission critical for Russia to demonstrate to the public , the success in development of its UCAVs .\nTherefore , we should reasonably expect that in the near future the wreckage of Kornet-D munitions and Lancet drones

ceasefire 45 times , using the heavy weapons prohibited by the Minsk agreements in 34 cases .\nToday , February 18 , Ukrainian soldiers and readers of InformNapalm informed us of a very alarming fact .\nAccording to them , in the evening of February 17 , a massive shelling of the Ukrainian territory by heavy artillery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe shells also reached the electronic intelligence post of Ukrainian defenders which had never been shelled before .\nThe editorial board of the InformNapalm international intelligence community has its own photo confirmations and additional evidence , but we

participating in the mission and have access to the data , which they then could share with the artillery units of the Russian occupation forces in the Donbas .\nAccording to the last quarterly report from February 7th 2022 , 689 citizens from 43 countries are working in the OSCE SMM in the Donbas .\nThere are no Ukrainians there , but , for instance , there are 24 Russian citizens and 6 citizens of Belarus .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the presence of Russian citizens and their access to the classified monitoring data of the mission .\nWe stressed that the representatives of Russia , the aggressor country , must be excluded from the mission .\nRussia , as an organizer of the conflict and the aggressor , has no moral right to include its citizens in OSCE SMM and conduct unhindered reconnaissance of Ukrainian positions .\nBesides , on 17 February 2022 , the Russian state news outlet TASS informed that at a meeting of the Permanent Council of this organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russian Federation to the OSCE Maksim Buyakevich said : \u201c If the OSCE mission lacks \u201c workers \u201d in Donbas , Russia is ready to supply even more highly qualified candidates to positions of responsibility in the SMM .\n\u201c This cynical statement emphasizes that Russia views its participation in the OSCE SMM in the Donbas as a convenient tool for conducting intelligence and hybrid warfare against Ukraine .\nRussian citizens can also influence the public reports of the mission , remove from them the information that is inconvenient for them because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts of Russia \u2019 s direct participation in the aggression against Ukraine , and they can manipulate the data The OSCE SMM is still the only international mission that can still visit and monitor the occupied territories , although it faces constant restrictions on movement or blocking of surveillance in certain areas by Russian occupation forces .\nAccording to the informed diplomatic sources , the Russians allow the mission to work in the occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts only upon the condition that there are Russian citizens participating in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain a kind of status-quo .\nAt the same time , it should be noted that despite the efforts of the Russian side , some important data on modern models of Russian equipment in the Donbas still occasionally appear in official reports of observers .\nThus , in 2019 , InformNapalm publicly drew the attention of the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the potential of OSCE SMM reports as a source of additional information , investigating which can record the undisputed participation of the Russian Armed Forces in aggression .\nAnd it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because in 2021 we saw an InformNapalm investigation , which was based on the analysis of OSCE SMM reports , used at high diplomatic levels .\nThe presence of Russian citizens in the OSCE SMM in the Donbas obviously supports a certain status quo .\nBut of course , Russia gets many more benefits for itself by having its own potential agents of influence and intelligence within the mission .\nProbably due to the influence of Russians , since 2014 , the OSCE mission in the Donbas had earned the reputation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts of Russian aggression and invasion of Russian equipment were ignored and did not appear in the mission \u2019 s reports .\nIt is noteworthy that all the observations by the OSCE SMM of unique examples of modern Russian technology in the Donbas were made with the help of UAVs , struggling against the interference from Russian EW systems .\nAnd there have been no reports in open sources that the Russians allowed OSCE SMM patrols to visit the areas where they are hiding these weapons .\nInformNapalm volunteers once again point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a full-scale Russian invasion , this factor of hybrid Russian influence through Russian citizens in the OSCE SMM must be carefully considered .\nFirst , Russian citizens should be removed from monitoring Ukrainian positions and should be restricted from accessing the classified part of the mission \u2019 s reports .\nThis could minimize their impact and limit their ability to provide intelligence and coordinates that can be used to guide Russian artillery shelling .\n\u2022 None Proofs of the Russian Aggression : InformNapalm releases extensive database of

December 2021 .\nThe entire 165 km long pipeline to the Polish border is already filled with gas .\nGas demand in the Baltic States , Finland and Poland amounts to around EUR 29 billion cubic meters per year .\nLithuania \u2019 s demand is 2.64 billion , Latvia \u2019 s \u2013 1.45 billion , Estonia \u2019 s \u2013 0.54 billion , Finland \u2019 s \u2013 about 2.5 billion and Poland \u2019 s

pipeline system in Central and Eastern Europe began in the 1960s .\nAlong with the economic goals it was supposed to make the Eastern Bloc countries dependent on gas supplies from the USSR .\nThis was reflected in the so-called \u201c Falin-Kwici\u0144ski \u201d doctrine which assumed that military influence could be replaced by energy pressure .\nThe symbolic action that initiated the development of the current architecture of gas supply to Central and Eastern Europe is the signing of an agreement between the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Austrian \u201c \u00d6sterreichische Mineral\u00f6lverwaltung \u201c ( OMV ) more than half a century ago \u2013 1st of June , 1968 .\nThis is the first contract to supply Soviet raw materials to the Western Europe .\nAbout three months later gas from the USSR reached the Austrian Baumgarten .\nToday it is the largest gas hub in Europe ( Central European Gas Hub \u2013 CEGH ) which is the keystone of Russia \u2019 s gas supply infrastructure to Europe .\nThe dynamic development of the gas supply system in Central and Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1984 the most important transmission line was put into operation \u2013 passing through Russia and Ukraine and then Slovakia right up to Baumgarten and Germany \u2013 Urengoy\u2013Pomary\u2013Uzhgorod pipeline under the name \u201c Brotherhood \u201d ( \u0411\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e ) .\nIt was a gas pipeline line which together with the oil pipeline network laid the foundations for Russia \u2019 s new strategy of controlling the former Eastern Bloc countries through raw resources .\nThis network was primarily of economic importance providing Russia with foreign currency incomes and substantial budget revenues .\nOil and gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe importance of these incomes is demonstrated by the fact that Russia \u2019 s budget is still based on the forecast price of crude oil .\nThe second main gas pipeline was built more than a decade after the launch of \u201c Brotherhood \u201d pipeline .\nThe Yamal-Europe pipeline \u201c Yamal \u201d ( \u042f\u043c\u0430\u043b ) was put into operation in 1997 running through Belarus and Poland to Germany .\nThe decision to build it was taken in early 1990 \u2019 s in anticipation of an increase of gas demand in Poland .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas supplies from Russia has made it possible to implement the \u201c Falin-Kwici\u0144ski \u201d doctrine .\nIt was based on two mechanisms .\nThe first was to link the price of gas in the contract with Gazprom to the foreign policy of the consuming country with a \u201c compliance premium \u201d for countries favoring Russia .\nThe second is the temporary interruption of raw material supplies during the heating season .\nThe first mechanism \u2013 the \u201c compliance premium \u201d .\nThis policy is as much effective as more dependent is country on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gas offered to individual countries in the region shows a direct correlation between their support of Russian politics and gas prices .\nGermany is the largest consumer of Russian gas in Europe .\nIn 2013 Gazprom supplied Germany with 40.18 billion cubic meters of natural gas .\nGermany , Italy and the UK accounted for more than half of the EU \u2019 s gas imports from Russia in 2013 .\nA good example of the use of a pricing mechanism to influence countries in the region was Russia \u2019 s 2013 negotiations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Viktor Yanukovych \u2019 s visit to St. Petersburg , the Ukrainian delegation agreed not to sign the Association Agreement with the European Union in exchange for a reduction in the price of natural gas from around USD 410 to USD 268.5 per thousand cubic meters and a 750 USD million loan .\nThe second mechanism used by Russia \u2013 the temporary interruption of raw material supplies during the heating season has been used several times .\nIts use has been directly linked not so much to the overall approach to Russian politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions by Central and Eastern European countries .\nThe first use of energy pressure was in 2006 .\nThe cause was the pro-Western Ukrainian government after the \u201c Orange Revolution \u201d in 2004 .\nAt that time Russia raised the price for gas from USD 80 to USD 230 per thousand cubic meters , i.e.\n, almost three times .\nTo leave Ukraine with no choice Russia also sabotaged the extension of the contract for Turkmenistan gas transit contract to Ukraine which had expired by the end of 2005 .\nIn the absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine were completely cut off on the night between 31 December 2005 and 1 January 2006 forcing the Ukrainian government to accept Russia \u2019 s terms .\nAnother gas crisis erupted in 2009 when Russia tried to force Ukraine to sign a \u201c fleet for gas \u201d ( \u0444\u043b\u043e\u0442 \u0437\u0430 \u0433\u0430\u0437 ) agreement which would extend the lease of a Russian naval base in Crimea in exchange for more favorable gas supply terms .\nThe failure of the parties to reach an agreement during the negotiations led to the interruption of gas supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a transit to the EU .\nThe gas crisis in 2009 led to a drop of pressure in gas pipelines in Central Europe which was felt most acutely in Slovakia .\nFinally , under pressure from European countries , Ukraine was forced to sign a gas supply contract at an unfavorable price of USD 450 per thousand cubic meters .\nMoreover , Ukraine had to accept a so called \u201c take-or-pay \u201d formula under which it had to pay for 33 billion cubic meters per year without the right to re-export the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result Ukraine paid the highest price for natural gas in Europe despite being the first country in the supply chain to Europe .\nIt was only in 2010 that the price of gas for Ukraine was reduced when the pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych took office as President of Ukraine .\nAt that time the aforementioned \u201c navy for gas \u201d agreement was signed allowing the Russian Black Sea Fleet to be stationed in Crimea until 2042 in exchange for a 30 % reduction in gas prices .\nThe implementation of such a brutal policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but has had serious consequences for Russia itself .\nThe credible threat of a cut-off of gas supplies to EU countries has undermined Russia \u2019 s credibility as a reliable gas supplier .\nThe most striking example of this is the above-mentioned imposition of a state of emergency on the Slovak economy .\nThis began the process of reducing dependence on Russian gas in all European countries .\nRussia \u2019 s dependence on transit through Ukraine has prevented it from effectively pursuing a \u201c policy of influence \u201d .\nAs early as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian Federation decided to create an alternative route that could guarantee Russia \u2019 s exports to its main European recipient \u2013 Germany , despite what situation might be in Ukraine .\nThis led to the idea of the \u201c Northern European Gas Pipeline \u201d later renamed as \u201c Nord Stream \u201d .\nRussia has mobilized all possible diplomatic and non-classical diplomatic means to complete the \u201c Nord Stream \u201d pipeline .\nGerman Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder who later became Chairman of the Supervisory Board of \u201c Nord Stream AG \u201d investors was a key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used similar political corruption against Finland as well .\nThe country \u2019 s Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen was also employed by \u201c Nord Stream AG \u201d during the construction of the pipeline just after his retirement from the office .\n\u201c Nord Stream \u201d flowing gas was originally intended for German needs , but the final destination was the Austrian Baumgarten ( CEGH ) hub .\nThis is the same hub that is the end point of the gas pipeline through Ukraine .\nThe onshore extension of \u201c Nord Stream \u201d that allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OPAL ( Ostsee-Pipeline-Anbindungsleitung ) pipeline which runs along the German-Polish border .\nThis structure creates the possibility of supplying gas to Central and Eastern Europe via \u201c Nord Stream \u201d then through the OPAL pipeline to the CEGH hub .\nThe first line of \u201c Nord Stream \u201d was put into operation on 8 November 2011 and second line was launched on 8 October 2012 .\nThe pipeline has a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year .\nThis coincided with Germany \u2019 s decision to move away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gas as a transition fuel .\nThe idea of extending the \u201c Nord Stream \u201d pipeline \u2019 s capacity by two more lines was first mentioned in 2011 .\nThis is essentially a sister project with the aim of increasing the capacity from 55 to 110 billion cubic meters of gas per year .\nBy comparison Poland \u2019 s annual gas demand is around 22 billion cubic meters .\nThe German government has consistently and actively supported the construction of \u201c Nord Stream 2 \u201d primarily through information support highlighting the economical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project .\nAt the same time , it has sought to take decisions at EU level that are beneficial for \u201c Nord Stream 2 \u201d .\nOn the contrary , the project \u2019 s biggest opponent Poland has been fiercely opposed the project and has been fighting for restrictions on \u201c Nord Stream 2 \u201d through all possible legal means .\nAs in essence the \u201c Nord Stream 2 \u201d and its connection via the OPAL pipeline to the CEGH hub would put an end to transit through Ukraine .\nThe main target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nord Stream 2 \u201d is clear \u2013 to make Russia independent from gas transit through Ukraine and if necessary , through Belarus-Poland transit as well .\nThe experience of the gas crises in 2006 and 2009 has made Russia realize the need to maintain the capacity to pursue a crisis management policy in the region while avoiding economic consequences for the Russian economy itself .\nThe result was the Ukraine bypass scenario implemented through the construction of three gas pipelines \u2013 \u201c Nord Stream \u201d , \u201c Nord Stream 2 \u201d and \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Turk Stream \u201d ) .\nFinally , the plan is to restructure Russia \u2019 s European gas transmission architecture so that gas reaches Central and Eastern Europe via the three pipelines mentioned above and the CEGH hub .\nAs a result , countries such as Poland , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , and Ukraine would be forced to import gas from the west instead of the east .\nConsidering all the transit fees for Germany and Austria these countries would receive significant financial benefits in exchange for political favor for Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details at the \u201c Nord Stream 2 \u201d conference in Brussels by Georg Zachmann who is an expert at the Bruegel Institute .\nThe presentation analyzed Russian natural gas flows to Europe in 2014 and the possible changes in flows following the completion of \u201c Nord Stream 2 \u201d .\nIn 2014 European consumers purchased 152 billion cubic meters of natural gas which reached their territory via three main routes : the Ukrainian ( \u201c Brotherhood \u201d ) , Baltic ( \u201c Nord Stream \u201d ) and Belarusian ( \u201c Yamal \u201d ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 38 billion and 36 billion cubic meters respectively .\nHowever , the most important here are not the volumes but the directions .\nThe Ukrainian route which is responsible for meeting Ukraine \u2019 s own needs and gas imports to the Balkan countries , Hungary , Slovakia , and Romania , for less than half of Russia \u2019 s gas imports to Austria and the Czech Republic , and for about 30 % of Russia \u2019 s gas imports to Italy .\nGas through Ukrainian transit way gas also partly reaches Germany .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ has squeezed gas supply through Ukraine to the Western European market .\nMostly to the Czech and Austrian markets which used to receive Russian gas only via Ukraine .\nThe OPAL pipeline which aims to distribute gas from \u201c Nord Stream \u201d across the continent plays a key role in this respect .\nGermany itself receives a large part of its gas from \u201c Nord Stream \u201d as well .\nFinally , Belarus \u2019 transit way through the \u201c Yamal \u201d pipeline accounts for 100 % of Poland \u2019 s imports from Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas imports to Germany .\nOnce \u201c Nord Stream 2 \u201d would be operational Russia could make it a priority export corridor .\nUnder such a scenario as much as 110 billion cubic meters of gas could be delivered to Western Europe via both \u201c Nord Stream \u201d and \u201c Nord Stream 2 \u201d .\nThe use of existing and future gas interconnectors could displace gas supply via Ukraine from the markets of Germany , Italy , Austria , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Hungary , and Ukraine itself .\nThe opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could also displace gas coming to the Balkans through the transit from Ukraine .\nPoland is currently working hard to delay launch of the \u201c Nord Stream 2 \u201d pipeline .\nSignificant efforts are being made to ensure independence from Russia until the end of the gas supply contract through the \u201c Yamal \u201d pipeline .\nFor this reason , Poland and Denmark are building the 10 billion cubic meters \u201c Baltic \u201d pipeline from Norway scheduled for completion in 2022 ; expanding the Swinoujscie LNG terminal \u2019 s discharge capacity from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Polish-Lithuanian interconnector ( GIPL ) , with a capacity of 2.1 billion cubic meters has been completed to take gas from the Klaip\u0117da LNG terminal ship \u201c Independence \u201d .\nIt is worth to say that the gas supply through the \u201c Yamal \u201d pipeline has already been disrupted twice \u2013 in 2016 and 2017 .\nThe first coincided with the NATO summit in Warsaw and the second with US President Donald Trump \u2019 s visit to Poland .\nThe disruption of supplies through Poland diverted the transit to \u201c Nord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bypass Poland when its politics are unacceptable to the Kremlin .\nIn addition , Poland and Croatia are implementing the North-South corridor scenario as part of the so-called \u201c Three Seas Project \u201d which aims to ensure smooth gas supplies to the countries in the region using the capacity of the Swinoujscie and Croatian LNG terminals .\nThis also includes the development of gas interconnections between the countries of the region \u2013 Poland-Slovakia and Poland-Czech Republic .\nA Poland-Ukraine interconnector is also planned .\nCover illustration : \u201e Amber Grid \u201c has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lithuania / Source \u201e Amber Grid \u201c The article was prepared for publication by volunteers of the Res Publica

warfare: What to expect next?", "content": "February 22nd 2022 spelled the end of the \u201c invisible \u201d war between Ukraine and Russia that has been going on for 8 years .\nI call it \u201c invisible \u201d , because most of the political and economic players around the world preferred to act as if it didn \u2019 t happen .\nIt is not the first \u201c invisible \u201d conflict in the world and not the last .\nIt is natural for people to ignore as long as they can something they don \u2019 t like or don \u2019 t know how to react to .\nNow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world to ignore the war anymore , and they will have to act .\nOn the other hand , assuming that the Kremlin did learn how to count their money and understands how sanctions will be ruining their economy \u2013 they are already thinking how to minimize the impact of severe economic sanctions that are being introduced by the USA and its allies .\nThe war Kremlin chose to begin costs a lot of money .\nTerritories occupied by Russia do not provide any economic profit and incur considerable costs to subsidize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and profits from the Black Sea shelf gas that the Kremlin has been stealing from Ukraine all those years is insignificant compared to their overall oil and gas resources .\nSo they do understand they are about to run out of money and they need a way to make sure they can still make it .\nAnd that is where information warfare plays a critical role in Putin \u2019 s plans .\nMake no mistake \u2013 Russia regards it \u2019 s \u201c journalists \u201d as an extension of their army , using them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalists who provided pro-Kremlin information coverage of the occupation of Crimea were awarded combat medals , on a par with the Russian military .\nIt is not a new instrument for Russia , and it is not Putin \u2019 s invention .\nThey just follow the old Soviet textbooks they studied in military academies or KGB schools .\nInformation warfare was a critical instrument for both Russian revolutions ( yes , there was more than one ) , \u201c agitators \u201d ( later we would call them \u201c propaganda officers \u201d and nowadays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) were a key element of spreading Bolshevik power to all the regions of the fallen Russian Empire , and Lenin used it constantly to keep his power in the face of internal rivals .\nRussian information warfare has 2 fronts \u2013 domestic and foreign .\nThe domestic front is focused on its own population and on the pro-Russian audiences in the neighboring countries that consume Russian information products ( books , magazines and newspapers , TV shows and movies , etc. )\n.\nIt doesn \u2019 t use any elaborate techniques , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information .\nIt doesn \u2019 t matter how primitive or absurd the messages are .\nThe objective is to flood the information space with them as much as possible .\nIt is like putting a powerwash in the target \u2019 s brain and hitting a button .\nForeign front targets the population in other countries .\nThis one is much more nuanced and complex .\nIt may target certain electoral groups , certain business areas or political parties or even individual politicians or voters .\nAnd its main goal is to blur the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong \u201d , \u201c good \u201d and \u201c evil \u201d .\nIt is one thing trying to make some money off rogue countries which are clearly evil , and quite another when the country is in a sort of \u201c gray area \u201d .\nToday Russia has clearly shown itself as a bad actor , they are an aggressor .\nGermany was forced to put on hold its favorite Nord Stream 2 .\nMany companies will halt their trading activity with Russia , etc .\nNobody wants to openly deal with an aggressor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut businesses also don \u2019 t want to lose money .\nAnd that \u2019 s where Russian Informational warriors will come to the fore .\nSome of them will rush to churn out \u201c balanced \u201d reports and analyses today , trying to \u201c explain \u201d the situation from Russia \u2019 s point of view , subtly pushing messages of the Kremlin propaganda .\nThey will try to lay a foundation to build a future \u201c gray area \u201d , and we already start seeing these efforts today .\nSome will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad actor , pushing the messages like \u201c truth is somewhere in the middle \u201d , \u201c it is not that black and white \u201d , etc .\nThen there will be articles aiming to distance Russia from this war .\nThere will be a lot of words like \u201c rebels \u201d ( aaaah , what a wonderful word \u2013 it brings images of Luke Skywalker fighting evil Empire and Rebel without a Cause .\nLook at any country and you will find a positive \u201c rebels \u201d .\nThere will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c pro-Russian territories \u201d , etc .\n\u2013 anything but \u201c Russian military \u201d or \u201c Russian forces \u201d .\n( just look the mainstream western media reporting about Ukraine during recent 8 years ) .\nAnd then later , we will see articles in the business media about economic losses incurred by the western countries because of the trade restrictions , which will finally give politicians on Putin \u2019 s payroll the ammunition to start dropping the economic deterrence measures .\nSuddenly we will see in the news , how evil stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and occupation turning into a \u201c peacekeeping mission \u201d .\nAnd it will be OK again to trade with a bloody dictator , harbor stolen money of Russian oligarchs and sell them villas and apartments with the sea view on the coasts of Florida , Spain or Italy .\nAnd all that will start with simple \u201c let \u2019 s see it from their point of view \u201d and \u201c it is not that black and white \u201d .\nWe have witnessed it during the hot phases of the war in 2014-2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied by an information campaign .\nWe have seen it when the Russian military shot down flight MH17 , we have seen it during every phase of MH17 investigation , and we will see it again in the coming weeks and months .\nOur brain consumes information \u2013 because this is its job .\nThere are a lot of influence

"title": "The possible consequences of a missile strike on the Chornobyl nuclear power plant", "content": "The scenario of the strike on Ukraine was developed by Russian military analysts in 2008 ( I.Jadan \u201c Operation Mechanical Orange \u201d ) .\nBack in 2014 , experts from the Institute of Safety Problems of Nuclear Power Plants of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine shared their vision of the radiation consequences of such an attack on the website chornobyl.in.ua .\nBelow are the main points with the amendment for 2022 .\nThe full text of the 2014 publication is available .\nWhat is the State Specialized Enterprise of the Chornobyl NPP by now ?\nThe Shelter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was slowly deteriorating .\nBut the building itself still remains functional .\nA New Safe Confinement ( NSC ) was built above the Shelter Object \u2013 an arch that can withstand tornadoes , heavy snow , static voltage , shock load .\nThe arch was built to allow the dismantling of unstable structures of the Shelter Object .\nWe also remember that the NPP building itself was constructed in accordance with special requirements .\nIn particular , part of the buildings of any nuclear power plant must withstand the maximum possible earthquake and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of the nuclear power plant \u2019 s facilities were built with the expectation of a plane crash and the impact of an air shock wave .\nIn the event of Russia \u2019 s aggression from Ukraine \u2019 s northern borders , the use of military aircraft will pose the greatest risk to Chornobyl .\nThe following hypothetical conditions were accepted : \u2013 strike on the Chornobyl nuclear power plant is carried out by aircraft ; \u2013 the energy release of the explosion is 1000 kg of trinitrotoluene ( TNT ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact of the air shock wave on the buildings and structures of the industrial site of the Chornobyl nuclear power plant .\nThe main danger of a bomb blast near the Chornobyl nuclear power plant is that a significant part of the radioactivity is in the form of dust inside the Shelter Object \u2013 ie under the OC and under the NSC .\nViolation of the NSC integrity will lead to the release of highly active dust into the environment .\nWhen the accident occurred , the fuel melted , radioactive lava flowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including them .\nNow this lava has stopped for a long time , frozen and cooled , forming something like a deja solid ( because it is molten sand ) , very heavy ( because there is uranium and lead , as well as other heavy metals , and they are quite heavy ) minerals .\nIt is not easy to dig out this substance from there \u2013 our Institute has been trying for more than 30 years , and this is a quest .\nTherefore , the main danger is radioactive dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be understood that the reactor burned during the Chornobyl accident .\nThe combustion temperature was very high , and radioactive substances were released into the air at a level above 10 km for several decades .\nIf any bomb is dropped on the Chornobyl nuclear power plant , such a fire is simply impossible .\nThere is nothing to burn .\nBut the destruction of the NSC in the event of an explosion is highly likely .\nAnd can lead to the release of highly radioactive dust into the environment .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irradiate the personnel located on the territory of the Chornobyl NPP and the personnel of the exclusion zone located in the city of Chornobyl \u2013 that is , this radioactive dust will remain on the territory of the exclusion zone itself .\nImagine that you are throwing a pile of pebbles into a pile of stones \u2013 and the dust flies up .\nSomething like this could happen in the event of a Chornobyl explosion .\nTo be less afraid , you should turn to the numbers .\nAccording to expert estimates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 120,000 Curie may enter the environment .\nThis is hundreds of thousands of times less than was thrown away in the 1986 Chernobyl accident , when 50,000,000 Curies were thrown out .\nFirst , those who will be nearby will be irradiated in the open air within a radius of a few kilometers ( and we are voting for such a scenario , because ours is no longer there ) .\nAccording to expert estimates , the radiation dose of Chornobyl personnel in the open air will be in the range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million times higher than the permissible levels of the population of Ukraine in the event of a radiation accident ) .\nNote that irradiation of the human body in such doses for a short period of time ( several hours ) will lead to the manifestation of radiation syndrome .\n1 Sv is considered the maximum dose capable of causing radiation sickness .\nThis dose of radiation will lead to dysfunction of human tissues and organs ( intestinal cramps , headache , apathy , nausea ) .\n2 deaths should be expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more than 1 SV .\nAt a distance of 16 km from the Chornobyl nuclear power plant in the city of Chornobyl , people living and working there will receive about 100 mSv .\nThese doses are relatively safe .\nIn the body irradiated in such doses , there is no change in blood composition and other severe effects of radiation .\nThis is a very conservative estimate , so in reality , the dose is likely to be much lower .\nBut the main danger for the population of Ukraine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through food chains and end up in the Pripyat River , and through it \u2013 in the Dnipro .\nThe Kyiv Reservoir , which is used for drinking water supply by millions of Ukrainians , will be under threat of intense radioactive contamination .\nIn order to prevent such a scenario , it will be necessary to build dams on the waterway , use filters \u2013 to invent those ways of water purification that have not yet been invented .\nDanger can occur if this radioactive water enters plants and thus contaminates agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this happens , it is necessary to listen carefully to the advice of scientists and , before starting to grow crops in the areas along the Pripyat and the northern part of the Dnipro \u2013 check the soil for radioactivity in sanatoriums and specialized institutes .\nThe movement of radioactive substances on land through trophic chains plant-human , plant-animal-human , soil-plant-animal-human is so fast that even those radionuclides that \u201c live \u201d for a relatively short time can accumulate in the human body in significant quantities \u2013 that is why it is extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the body .\nIt is still unknown what is happening now with spent nuclear fuel storage facilities in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone .\nThere are two of them on the territory of the 10-km Chornobyl zone .\nWe hope that all of the above will remain just a hypothetical scenario .\nRemember that this is just a scenario , a possible course of events with some set of assumptions .\nWhy do you need to know this ?\nTo be ready .", "author": "vasgri", "url":

international intelligence community published a material about Colonel Dmitry Uskov , the commander of the 19th Motorized Rifle Division of the 58th Army of the Southern Military District ( military unit 01860 , Vladikavkaz , Sputnik village , North Ossetia ) .\nThe same publication noted that among the Russian invasion forces in Ukraine , from the 429th Motorized Rifle Regiment ( MRR ) of the 19th MSD , there were three battalion tactical groups ( BTG ) and one tactical reserve group ( TRG ) , formed on the basis of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battalions and a tank battalion , reinforced by other units of the regiment .\nToday we are ready to share information about the servicemen of the above-mentioned 429th Regiment , who have already obtained their one-way tickets to the void .\nWe would like to remind you that the initial formation of the 19th MSD actively participated in the Russian aggression against Georgia in August 2008 , bringing death and destruction to the Tskhinvali region .\nSince the beginning of March 2022 , reports began to appear in open sources about participants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , on March 8 , 2022 Caucasian Knot information outlet reported that \u201c

account of the unofficial speaker of the 58th Combined Arms Army Oleg Marzoev , who actively publishes obituaries on Russian occupiers liquidated in Ukraine , and there are already more than 10 of them , but in our publication we focus specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRR of the 19th Division , since interest in the liquidated Russian guards is much lower .\nBy studying the list of killed Russian servicemen and running their personal data against our archival lists , we established that four servicemen were listed in the BTGs of the 429th MRR .\nAccording to our information , the tactical groups of the 429th MRR invaded Ukraine from the occupied Crimea and operated in the Kherson-Mykolayiv area .\nThe proof is a photograph on social networks , in which a Ukrainian Army fighter is shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new tactical badge of the 19th Motorized Rifle Brigade .\nSome inaccuracies in the obituaries can be explained by the intention of the Russian side to confuse the traces of their units .\n\u2022 The squad sergeant is the commander of the combat vehicle of the 3rd squad of the 3rd platoon of the 4th company of the 2nd battalion , contract sergeant major Kachmazov Artur Kazbegovich ( 2nd BTG ) .\nObituary He has the pseudonym \u201c Igor Belyaev \u201d on social media .\n\u2022 Anti-aircraft gunner of the 2nd crew of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-aircraft battery , contract

bloody special false-flag operations against citizens of the Russian Federation .\nPossible scenarios include shelling of Russian border cities with MLRS from the territory of Ukraine , terrorist

the Russian military plans to attack the borderline cities of the Russian Federation using the BM-21 Grad MLRS in order to accuse Ukraine of attacking the civilian population , \u201d warns Alexander

information agenda , Putin is ready to kill dozens , hundreds and even thousands of Russian citizens .\nThe Kremlin has already begun to implement such a scenario in the Donbas .\nOn March 14 , russists staged a strike by Tochka-U missile on the Ukrainian city of Donetsk , occupied by Russian troops since 2014 .\nTo create a propaganda picture , they killed dozens of civilians , having

and pointed out clear facts proving that Russian territory was shelled with MLRS from the temporarily occupied territory of the Luhansk Oblast , controlled by the Russian Armed Forces .\nThis investigation was translated into 11 languages and even the Russian opposition activists actively shared it .\nFrom February 22 up to the initial phase of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine , the InformNapalm website was subjected to a powerful DDos attack .\nApparently , it was organized by the intelligence agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates that on the eve of the invasion , Russian intelligence agencies actively used false pretexts and carried out false flag operations in order to announce the start of a \u201c special operation to demilitarize Ukraine.\n\u201d Now that the whole world has seen the consequences of the inhuman actions of the Russian Federation , bombing and missile attacks on the peaceful Ukrainian cities of Kharkiv , Mariupol , Gostomel , Irpin and others , the Russian military command is getting ready to sacrifice civilian lives not only in Ukraine .\nFor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kremlin is considering more bloody false flag operations which will kill Russian citizens on the territory of their own country .\nThe Russian intelligence agencies are likely to soon carry out bloody acts of sabotage and terrorist attacks , shelling and murders , trying to blame them on Ukraine and/or \u201c Ukrainian nationalists.\n\u201d Such actions are being planned to cause hatred for Ukraine in order to quickly strengthen the units of the Russian army , which suffer huge losses in hostilities in a foreign territory .\nThese are the methods of fascist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort to them in his war against Ukraine .\nThe Putin regime is in agony .\nHe did not expect to receive such a fierce rebuff from the Ukrainians .\nHe is now ready to cause new bloodshed not only of the Ukrainians , but also the peaceful citizens of Russia , in order to drown in blood the shame and contempt that he has already received from all the civilized world and to which he doomed the whole of Russia for decades .\nAnd even captured Russian conscripts are aware that they @ @

and demoralize the Ukrainian resistance .\nAt the same time , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make concessions and procrastinate with the military support for Ukraine .\nBelarus has become a springboard for attacks against Ukraine and will next become a springboard for attacks against Poland and the Baltic states .\nPutin is likely to take this step after trying to carry out an unprecedented genocide of

which is why Russian propagandists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c chemical laboratories in Ukraine.\n\u201d Putin will lose in any case , but , while losing , he will seek to destroy Ukrainians and the

nations who have disobeyed and resisted .\nHe can not break the resistance with the help of conventional weapons , bombs , and missiles , so while threatening a nuclear strike he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @

of hostilities against Ukraine on February 24 , 2022 , reports about funerals of Russian military men became a mainstay of the Russian regional and federal media .\nIn the early days , there was complete silence in the Russian media space , and this is easily explained .\nIn order to be buried , the first Russians killed in action had to be brought to Russia , properly documented and then

, InformNapalm volunteer intelligence community demonstrates an example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casualty data of the Russian Armed Forces .\nWe turn to the Russian \u201c medal count \u201d for helpful information about the body count .\nRead the details in our investigation .\nRussian losses in the first week In the very first days , Ukraine immediately reported thousands of Russians killed in

losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here we need to make a remark .\nKonashenkov is a spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Defense \u2013 he talks about the losses of the Russian Army and units reporting to the Ministry of Defense .\nBut the Russian Guard of the Ministry of Internal Affairs is also involved in the war against Ukraine .\nThere are also Alpha and Vympel special operations forces as well as Russian border guards that belong to the FSB of the Russian Federation .\nThe losses for these agencies have not yet been told at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to March 2nd .\nBack then Ukraine announced Russian losses at 5840 killed military men .\nEffectively , these were the losses of the Russians in the first week of the war .\nIn recent weeks , we have begun to analyze reports in the Russian regional

officers and individual military officers with spectacular wins , also receive this order \u2013 but these are isolated cases .\nBasically , the Order of Courage is now issued posthumously .\nIndividual senior officers are awarded the star of the Hero of Russia for severe wounds or posthumously .\nSo Denis Shishov , the commander of the 11th Air Assault Brigade , wounded during the assault on Kakhovka , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c feat \u201d took place on February 25 , and the news about the award appeared only two weeks later .\nLet \u2019 s quote : Indeed , only a person gravely wounded to the head would defend the Donbas near Kakhovka .\nThe commander of the 331st Kostroma Regiment of the Airborne Forces , Colonel Sergei Sukharev , who was killed in Ukraine , received the Star of the Hero posthumously .\nBut junior officers and soldiers receive simpler awards .\nWounded soldiers receive a Medal for Courage ( a copy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this can be seen on almost all videos

Oblast presented to the wounded soldiers of the Russian Guard a regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valor and Courage \u201d .\nThis is not a state or departmental award , just a colored badge with a ribbon from the hands of local authorities .\nBut how do we estimate the number of issued decorations ?\nSome Russian soldiers and journalists post photos of decoration certificates showing the serial numbers of

It is immediately striking that a large number of awards relate to the presidential decree signed on March 3 \u2013 this is about a week into the full-scale war against Ukraine .\nThat is , those who died in the first days got on this decorations list .\nIt was on this day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first , and so far for the last time .\nThe lowest serial number of the posthumous Order of Courage according to the decree of March 3 , 2022 which we could find is 78487 .\nThe difference between them makes 4794 orders .\nThis is a very rough assessment , because every day we find new numbers , and these figures will most probably be adjusted upwards , increasing the count of the decree of March 3rd .\nMost of the awards for this day are posthumous , because only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounds .\nThat is , the number of issued posthumous awards approximately matches the data published by Ukraine on the losses of Russians in the first days of the war .\nWhat is the numbering system of Russian awards ?\nAfter the outbreak of the war in the Donbas in 2014 , the numbering of the Orders of Courage was in the range of 70xxx \u2013 77xxx .\nInformNapalm volunteers have repeatedly written about the awarding of this Order for participation in the Donbas hostilities .\nThe highest serial number we have detected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knowledge that the numbering of the Orders of Courage from the beginning of the full-scale war starts from numbers greater than 78xxx .\nBut as our OSINT studies show , the numbering in the first days of the war has already exceeded 83,000 .\nThe Order of Courage is also given to civilians , for example , for individual feats in extinguishing fires , or to important artists or scientists , but these cases are very rare .\nFor the most part , this is a typical military award , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbreak of hostilities \u2013 in Chechnya , Syria , Crimea-Donbas 2014 and others .\nThere are cases when an award with a lower serial number is issued by a new decree \u2013 perhaps to decorate somebody who was first missing in action , and then officially recognized as killed .\nSometimes it could be a higher number on an old decree \u2013 these are also isolated cases , where some department might have reserved number slots for their awards .\nBut mostly , we see serial numbers gradually increasing .\nDuring the First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 90s the numbering was from 0 to 30000 .\nDuring the Second Chechen War and before the seizure of Crimea and the war in the Donbas the numbers ranged from 30,000 to 60,000 .\nThe Ukrainian campaign for the Russian army started with numbers as of 7xxxx .\nAnd Putin \u2019 s mass posthumous decoration of March 3 stands out prominently .\nThe Ukrainian army will gladly issue an \u201c Order of Courage ( posthumously ) \u201d to every Russian occupier !\nDistribution and reprint with reference to the source is welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International \u2014 CC BY 4.0 ) InformNapalm social media pages :

"informnapalm", "title": "Cossacks: servants of the Kremlin or gravediggers of the empire", "content": "We would like to share an interesting analytical article by Maksym Maiorov , a Strategic Communications and Information Security Center expert .\nThe article references many earlier studies and OSINT-investigations by InformNapalm and assembles a puzzle that presents comprehensively the opportunities that can be used in Ukraine \u2019 s interests .\nThe hybrid war is like a masquerade\u2014it has brought some colorful characters to the fore .\nThese characters include a familiar image of Russian Cossacks in sheepskin hats and vibrant uniforms with many medals .\nThere is a misconception that the Russian Cossacks are the same as the Ukrainian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costumes and uniforms and participating in community life on the same basis as other non-governmental organizations and associations .\nHowever , they aren \u2019 t .\nInstead , the Russian Cossacks ( from the Don , Kuban , Terek , and elsewhere ) act as a force that is much more intricately connected with the government and even claims a part of state power in certain areas they consider to be historically Cossack lands .\nThey are a fairly numerous , rather passionate , but , at the same time , an extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with internal contradictions .\nCossacks are constantly mentioned in the reports about crime , political adventures , hot spots , ethnic hatred , and confrontation with the democratic opposition .\nCossack societies cropped up back in the late-USSR times .\nCossacks engage in incessant disputes among the Whites and the Reds , democrats and strongmen fans , separatists and adherents of a strong government , ancestral Cossacks and those who just registered as Cossacks .\nIn addition , Cossack communities bring together politicians , business people , retired security personnel , gangsters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate culture , and ideology of the movement .\nCossacks have been mentioned in the Russian Law On Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples ( April 1991 ) among other repressed cultural and ethnic communities entitled to the restoration of the territorial integrity that existed before the anti-Constitutional policy of the violent redrawing of borders , the restoration of ethnic entities that existed before their abolition , and the compensation for the damage caused by the state .\nFor this reason , the Cossacks started demanding the restoration of their territorial entities , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constituent Big Assembly of the Cossacks Union in Moscow , 1990 It was physically impossible to restore \u201c fair borders \u201d for everyone because administrative boundaries were shifting within the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic all the time in favor of one community or the other .\nRussian Cossacks have most of their territorial disputes with the indigenous ethnic groups of the North Caucasus that also engaged actively in state-building .\nIn Caucasian politics , the Cossacks \u2019 orientation was far from being consistent .\nThey treated the Ingush and Adyghe as enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ossetians ; they supported the Armenians in Karabakh but attacked them in regions of Rostov , Krasnodar , and Stavropol .\nFrom time to time , the Cossacks were at peace with the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and the Confederation of Mountain

that stained itself with blood while fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ukraine , has a longer track record .\nIn November 1993 , the Cossacks of the Caucasus Line Cossack Host reached an agreement with Oleg Lobov , Secretary of Russia \u2019 s Security Council , to vest the 21st Separate Airborne Brigade with the status of a Cossack brigade .\nAt least a third of its personnel had to be Cossacks .\nThe following year , the brigade was renamed \u201c Stavropol Cossack Brigade \u201d after its home station .\nAfter the First Chechen War , the brigade was reorganized into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit 54801 ,

same year , the commander of this regiment \u2019 s 2nd battalion Stanislav Ershov assumed the duties of the deputy commander of the 6th General Platov Separate Motorized Rifle Cossack Regiment of the 2nd Army Corps of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People \u2019 s Republic ( LPR ) .\nThe 247th Regiment was often mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Russo-Ukrainian war that began in February 2022 .\nNurmagomed Gadzhimagomedov , a company commander from the regiment , became the first dead Russian soldier officially recognized by Moscow ( however , given his name and place of birth , he most likely was a Lak by ethnic origin and hardly considered himself a Cossack ) .\nThe Cossack paratroopers and the other Russian troops were repelled valiantly by the defenders of Ukraine .\nFor instance , colonel Konstantin Zizevsky , commander of the 247th regiment , was killed on March 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russian Cossacks seem to have grown fully symbiotic with the Putin regime .\nMoscow gave the Cossacks broad powers and privileges .\nWhile in the service of the dictatorship , they tarnished themselves as murderers and aggressors .\nHowever , one still can attempt to look at the Russian Cossacks as a force that can be re-used against Putin \u2019 s empire to Ukraine \u2019 s benefit without belittling the severity of the crimes , whose perpetrators must be prosecuted .\nThe relationship between the regime and the Cossacks is far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition voices does not mean the absence of the opposition sentiment .\nFirstly , the Cossacks keep professing the self-determination ideal in the form of their own self-governing territorial entities .\nNeither of the regions of Rostov , Krasnodar , or Stavropol fit the bill .\nWithout being able to recreate the Don Cossack Host in the Rostov Oblast , Kozitsyn \u2019 s Cossack National Guard attempted to do so in the occupied Luhansk Oblast .\nAs a result , a bitter conflict broke out between the Don Cossacks and the administration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were armed clashes and mutual public accusations .\nThe Don Cossacks lost in this confrontation , with some of them killed , some expelled from the self-proclaimed statelets , and the rest subordinated to the centralized command of the Russian terrorist forces .\nThe tensions between the Terek Cossacks and highland peoples have not been solved .\nThe Terek Cossacks are losing to the indigenous people of the Caucasus demographically .\nIn addition , the Putin regime decided to rely on Kadyrov and , by doing so , buried the Cossacks \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Terek \u2019 s left bank .\nSecondly , the \u201c ancestral \u201d Cossacks are strongly dissatisfied with the transformation of the Cossacks into a legion of Putin \u2019 s thugs .\nAccording to the \u201c ancestral \u201d Cossacks , most of the registered Cossacks in Russia are \u201c fancy-dressed reenactors \u201d and preference seekers .\nThe \u201c ancestral \u201d Cossacks are convinced that only the Cossacks by origin , those with Cossacks among their ancestors , are genuine .\nFor this reason , the \u201c ancestral \u201d Cossacks perceive their movement as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cossacks idealize the pre-revolutionary Cossacks and the White Russian movement and consider Putin \u2019 s regime to be rooted in the KGB and Bolshevik history .\nWhile the opposition-minded \u201c ancestral \u201d Cossacks are in the minority , their voices are still heard .\nThey earned their high standing in the field of the Cossack revival and the reputation of martyrs because of their persecution by the Kremlin regime .\nThese people include , for instance , the All-Cossack Civic Center headed by the ataman Aleksandr Dzikovitsky and the entourage of Vladimir Melikhov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have taken a pro-Ukrainian and pro-Western stance after 2014 .\nThe burden of the war and sanctions will raise the issue of potential options for mitigating the negative consequences by separating from Moscow for regions and organized communities in the Russian Federation .\nAlthough , some of them will probably not find the courage to take this path ; some will not find a reliable social footing and ideological background for the secession .\nHowever , the regions with strong Cossack traditions have both the potential and the tradition of fighting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pro-Ukrainian ; the question will be about survival , not about their sympathies .\nIt is very much in Ukraine \u2019 s interest to have small , even unfriendly , Cossack republics as neighbors rather than a single huge and hostile Russia .\nUndoubtedly , making this interest come true will require effort .\nOn a final note , I will say a couple of words about the Kuban Cossacks .\nUkrainians romanticize this region as the largest Ukrainian ethnic mass abroad .\nThe Kuban Cossacks and the Ukrainians derive their traditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still spoken in the region despite decades of Russification .\nHowever , the Kuban has become even more alienated from Ukraine than the neighboring Russian-speaking Don .\nThe political focus of the Kuban and Terek Cossacks has developed under the influence of the competition and confrontation with the indigenous North Caucasian people .\nFor this reason , there the attitudes in the Kuban region are much more chauvinistic and aligned with the idea of a strong Russian state .\nFor Kuban Cossacks , the cultural affinity with Ukraine seems more of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere are , of course , genuine Ukrainian patriots among the Kuban Cossacks , but they do not set the general tone .\nIf one is to work with the Kuban , it will make much more sense to focus on achieving the Kuban Cossack independence rather than trying to bring about the Ukrainian unity from the San River to the Caucasus Mountains .\nThis situation report was prepared by Maksym Maiorov especially for InformNapalm .\nDistribution and reprint

.\nNaturally , there always are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that require funds .\nWe have exhausted our own reserves long ago , but we need to replenish certain reserves now \u2013 to buy fuel , tactical gear ,

up for public discussion , as well as draw the attention of the intelligence communities of Ukraine and other countries ( the main conclusion is at the end of this publication ) .\nThis morning , Vyacheslav Gladkov , the governor of the Belgorod Oblast of the Russian Federation , claimed that the Armed Forces of Ukraine ( AFU ) \u201c fired at the village of Golovchino.\n\u201d Judging by the photographs presented in the media , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the 9K57 Uragan MLRS .\nIts firing range is assessed from 10 to 35 km .\nThat is , if you believe the version voiced by the Russian governor and the media , then Ukrainians must have positioned their MLRS practically on the Russian border .\nHowever the reasons are unclear for the AFU to divert forces and assets to strike at a random village .\nTo do what ?\nBreak some windows there ?\nWhat \u2019 s the point of this ?\nLet us note that Russian propagandists pedaling this version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel depot in Belgorod and the sinking of the Moskva cruiser were due to \u201c fire accidents and the human factor.\n\u201d That is , they are trying very hard to put real military losses down to the \u201c human factor and negligence of fire safety rules.\n\u201d But when some useless shed is set on fire or a MLRS round lands in someone \u2019 s garden , this is consistently presented as the \u201c actions of the AFU \u201d .\nRather inconsistent .\nIt is noteworthy that 5 days before the full-scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actively pushed fakes about another \u201c FSB borderline shed \u201d and about another \u201c MRLS shelling by the AFU \u201d of the territory of the Rostov Oblast .\nHowever InformNapalm , having investigated the reports and having geolocated the area , exposed it as a false flag operation .\nNamely , the multiple rocket launcher came from the territory of the Luhansk Oblast controlled by the Russian troops , and at 4 AM fired its volley .\nThen , 2 days before the invasion , probably because of this article , our site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on February 24 we witnessed the start of the full-scale invasion\u2026 But now it is not even about consistency , we should like to point out an important detail .\nNamely , not far from the village of Golovchino , there is a closed military compound Belgorod-22 and Object 1150 of the 12th Main Directorate of the Russian Ministry of Defense .\nThis is a nuclear weapons storage facility .\nPresumably , it is currently used for storage of tactical nuclear weapons .\nTherefore , this shelling can be a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c stir \u201d in the area .\nIn military jargon , this means stirring up active movements near a military facility , which could help disguise the meaningful activity .\nWe believe such a \u201c stir \u201d could cover issuing of tactical nuclear weapons to the Russian air force .\nAccording to our preliminary information , this facility is used to store nuclear warheads for bombs and air-to-ground missiles .\n\ud83d\udd25 This stir could be necessary for covert preparations of the Russian Armed Forces for powerful strikes against Mariupol or Ukrainian forces in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u270d\ufe0f These are only

fact is not officially recognized , we know that such lists are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the status as of around 2018 or 2019 .\nFor example , Omurbekov was not on the DIU list , as had not been in command of the 64th MRB until 2020 .\nHowever some investigative journalists who started doing OSINT during the period of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation took the list as hard evidence of the participation of military personnel in the aggression , which led to some embarrassing mistakes .\nThe list contained many conscripts who had retired from the Russian Armed Forces , therefore it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparing the data of sergeants and officers , but not as a credible actual proof of their participation in aggression .\nHowever , the phone found directly in the war zone with photographs of soldier \u2019 s colleagues represent a more material piece of evidence .\nNevertheless , we admit that some of those who were in the photos might not have participated in the crimes .\nThis should be established by the prosecutor \u2019 s office for each individual .\nThis publication serves as additional material that can help investigators narrow down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual guilt of each war criminal .\nBased on photos and videos , we were able to identify more than 100 servicemen of this brigade .\nThe volume of data is very large , so at the first stage we publish the names of the first 50 Russian military men from the reconnaissance battalion and command of the 64th MRB .\nOur data contain the identification data of 5 officers of this military unit , in charge of military reconnaissance .\nIn the process of preparing this publication , we noticed that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaned up by the Russian intelligence agencies or the military men themselves .\nFor example , the social media accounts of the brigade intelligence commander captain Dmitry Degotya have been deleted , but we still have online archives , so the captain is in for another \u201c surprise \u201d .\nIt should be noted that the data of the Russian servicemen does not follow a single format ( some lists do not have ranks , patronymics , personal numbers and passport data ) .\nThe identification of the invaders was carried out both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contacts .\nWe received some assistance from an anti-war activist from Khabarovsk , who recently served in the 64th MRB .\nWe also used lists leaked on the Internet on the eve of the Russian military invasion of Ukraine , as well as during the war .\nThese lists have been circulating in specialized hacktivist forums , and now they also appear in the DUI publications .\nTherefore , most of these lists were already known to us from the hacktivist materials .\nAccording to our estimates , some lists can be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some from the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021 .\nAccordingly , they can be deemed relevant , but still , there could be minor errors in terms of the discharges or appointments of some contract servicemen .\nSocial media accounts of many identified persons are closed or inactive , so some of the photos are of poor quality or very old .\nCentral subject of our OSINT investigation who lost his phone in the war zone .\n\u2022 Sergeant Petr Zakharov ( Rus .\n: \u0417\u0430\u0445\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440 \u0410\u0440\u0442\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 )

international intelligence community received an interesting document recovered in the village of Velyka Dymerka , Kyiv Oblast .\nIt was found among the papers left behind by the Russian servicemen as they fled the area or were defeated .\nThis is a reference for use by Russian soldiers instructing them about how to communicate with the disgruntled locals who are clearly unhappy about the occupation .\nThe document was apparently written by a morale officer or a politruk , as they are still called in the Russian army .\nThe content of the document shows that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general political line of the Russian leadership on Ukraine , demonstrates good observation ability , has basic knowledge and applied skills in psychology , understands the mood of the soldiers around him as well as the grievances of the Ukrainian locals .\nIn one notable passage , he cautions against using some Russian propaganda mainstays that do not work in that part of Ukraine , e.g.\n, about the \u201c people being shelled in the Donbas \u201d , as locals are not buying any of it .\nOur politruk teaches his soldiers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propaganda and disinformation techniques : gaslighting , red herrings , whataboutisms , false accusations , name-calling , appeal to prejudice , etc .\nSoldiers are directed to use euphemisms about Russia and its actions , shift blame onto Ukrainians authorities , answer questions with a question and also tell outright lies .\nLet us have a look at some notable examples .\nRed herring This is one of the favorite techniques here .\nWhen asked if you \u201c \u201d , you say that you are \u201c \u201c , as this \u201c \u201c , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You also tell them about gay parades , sale of the land to foreigners , biological laboratories , and all other ungodly things you are saving them from .\nOur politruk generally recommends not answering any questions about the war , and only answering \u201c those questions we have an answer to \u201c .\nGaslighting Another favorite .\nAlthough it is clear that they are an occupation army , the soldiers are advised to answer the questions about why they are there in arms with \u201c we \u2019 ve come with a humanitarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c we \u2019 re temporarily filling in for the police who have escaped \u201c .\nBlame shifting The food shortage and power blackouts should be blamed on the Ukrainian authorities or the police .\nAll in all , there are several calls to \u201c \u201d of responsibility or communication .\nLies and deception When asked about bombed power substations and power outages , the soldiers should say that local Ukrainian authorities and police blew them up , or as an alternative \u201c the entire north of Ukraine was blacked out by order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is another ploy widely used throughout the document .\nYou do not say \u201c \u201d \u201c \u201d \u201c \u201c , you say \u201c the problem was taken care of \u201c .\nAnd that applies to \u201c \u201c .\nYou also do not use the world \u201c war \u201d .\nAnd , of course , you do not say [ quote ! ]\n\u201c \u201d \u201c \u201c .\nThese last two phrases come from the \u201c How it sounds \u201d column , i.e .\ndescribing the actual dominant mood of the politruk \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notes \u201d to another question he says that \u201c yes , we are Russians !\n\u201c , but you should avoid asserting it for the time being to avoid confrontation .\nName calling Our brave politruk also instructs how to do the name calling right .\nYou do not say \u201c \u201d or \u201c \u201c , this is confrontational .\nBut you can call Poroshenko and Zelensky \u201c \u201d led by the \u201c \u201c .\nAnd under the \u201c Explanation \u201d to that question , he concedes that \u201c we will be forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 Ukraine \u2019 and \u2018 Ukrainian \u2019 \u201d for a while .\nConclusion There are many other telling passages in this document .\nWe are publishing its complete translation here .\nIt is a fascinating reading , giving a rare insight into the thinking of the rank-and-file Russian soldiers and their command , without any diplomatic glossing or political spin .\nIt is impossible to establish the actual Russian military unit which produced this document , as this area saw many of them .\nAnd it does not really matter .\nThe document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units that entered Ukraine on February 24 .\nAll in all , the text makes the impression of somebody trying to teach orcs not to sound like orcs .\nBut we should make no mistake \u2013 this orkish army came to Velyka Dymerka to eliminate everything Ukrainian and turn The Shire into Mordor .\nLittle did they know\u2026 \u2022 The criminal from Bucha lost his phone in Ukraine .\n\u201c They already know they

it is the guilty ones who are punished .\nThat is why we are publishing this report .\nOn May 25-26 , a photograph of a Russian occupier robbing apartments in Kyiv Oblast was shared by many Telegram

.\nOur volunteers doubted the similarity between the face in the photo from Irpin and the face of the \u201c identified \u201d Tretyakov and decided to conduct their own investigation .\nIts result refutes the version of the Ministry of Digital Transformation .\nUsing OSINT , InformNapalm volunteers identified a Russian serviceman Pavel Dmitrievich Pilantov who was born on September 17 , 1996 in

Swiss shell company , Galika AG , This company \u2019 s director is Lino Derungs , a Swiss citizen .\nHowever , he has been doing business in Russia since the early 1990s .\nSwitzerland allegedly joined the sanctions against defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US and the EU imposed due to the annexation of Crimea .\n\u201c But we do not want to be perceived as a country taking sides .\nTherefore , we

he was the deputy director of Stankoprom Holding , a part of Rostekh .\nThus , it becomes clear why the Swiss company cooperates with the Russian defense industry .\nAccording to tender data , from 2016 to 2021 , Galika CTS signed contracts worth RUB 1.4 billion with Russian clients .\nHowever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , after the sanctions were imposed in 2014-2015 , most orders for defense

ODK-UMPO enterprise for producing engines for SU-57 fighters , also knew about the final recipient of its products .\nHere , we offer several arguments to prove this .\n\u2022 None Firstly , this expensive equipment must be installed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWithout it , such equipment is just a lump of iron .\n\u2022 None Secondly , considering the message on Facebook , in November 2020 , Galika AG \u2019 s service manager Ivan Semenskoy flew from Sheremetyevo Airport ( Moscow ) to Ufa ( Bashkortostan ) .\nODK-UMPO , which ordered the expensive machine tools , is located right there .\nMarek

Accreditation Service audited the company that certified equipment imported to the Russian Federation .\nIt turned out that the German company authorized Galika AG to sell its machines there .\nIt means that one firm in Switzerland produces machine tools , and another , which does not produce anything but only resells , represents the manufacturer in the Russian Federation .\nIndex Traub , also a German company , not only supplies equipment to Russians but also opened an office in the Russian city of Tolyatti , Samara Oblast , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision was made due to the \u201c political situation.\n\u201d \u201c The current political situation requires us to localize our production in Russia so that we can participate in tenders of state-owned companies on an equal footing with other market participants , \u201d Blohm Jung GmbH of Germany expressly states on its website that it is part of the UNITED GRINDING Group with dedicated subsidiaries for international markets in India , China , Russia , and the USA .\nAll these companies help Russia produce weapons used in the war against Ukraine .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the Russian market anyway .\nSwitzerland has long known that

military materiel and was not considered so-called dual-use goods .\nWe are talking about those machines that can be used for military purposes , \u201d And last year , Galika AG applied to SECO , the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs , to obtain two permits to export to Russia : a Swiss-made milling machine and a lathe .\nIt was claimed to be intended to make parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swiss

international intelligence community InformNapalm on how companies from Switzerland , Italy , and Germany help russia circumvent sanctions to produce weapons .\nThis study has been translated into many languages and has caused a significant resonance in the Ukrainian and foreign media .\nReaders have rightly pointed out that it is not only European countries but also Ukraine that host russian business that tries to circumvent sanctions .\nTo reveal such business , we publish a new study on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence it has .\nA company has russian final beneficiaries , yet it was licensed during the war in Ukraine and now , it is trying to use its influence to circumvent sanctions in various countries .\n1XBet worked in Ukraine even before gambling was legalized in the country , it was laundering money via miscoding .\nThis way , in PrivatBank , payments to the betting site were named housing and communal services .\nThe \u201c official \u201d 1XBet registered in Ukraine will operate on behalf of Your Betting Company LLC ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u00bb ) .\nIt was registered in June 2021 and , from a legal perspective , does not have any connection to the russian company , apart from the brand .\nThis is the conclusion reached by the Ukrainian Commission for the Regulation of Gambling and Lotteries ( KRAIL ) specialists and this is why they issued two licenses to Your Betting Company LLC : one for bookmaking and another for organizing gambling on the Internet .\nThe company has one \u201c owner \u201d , Serhiy Petrovych Tsybin .\nThis businessman from Dnipro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his family are associated with some businesses in Ukraine and abroad .\nOfficially , 1XBet is a large fragmented structure made up of hundreds of companies around the world .\nIt is a multi-level system of offshore enterprises that are intertwined with people , services , and contracts .\nSome companies are responsible for the development , some for marketing , others for finance , intellectual property , and other activities .\nLegally , there is no single ultimate owner in this group , and it may seem to be no connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system was built for about 15 years so that 1XBet could operate both legally and illegally , and the real owners were protected from claims by government agencies and law enforcement agencies in different countries .\nHowever , the ultimate owners of this business do exist .\nSince the founding of 1XBet , they are three russians : Roman Semiokhin , Sergey Karshkov , and Dmitry Kazorin .\nThey created the first betting platform 1XBet in Bryansk , russia .\nSergey Karshkov used to be the head of the Bryansk department of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to combat cyber crimes , Roman Semiokhin has a joint business in breeding rabbits with the wife of the former mayor of Bryansk , a Bryansk Regional Duma deputy , construction tycoon and a member of the United Russia party Nikolay Patov .\nLater , Roman Semiokhin switched his interests totally to the construction industry .\nAccording to the local media , he bought most of the commercial real estate in the city and became one of the most influential people in the region .\nAnd a little later , together with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a criminal case concerning the activities of 1XBet in russia .\nAt the moment , all the founders are allegedly on the international wanted list .\nHowever , this is official information .\nThe real-life is that Semiokhin and Karshkov live in Cyprus , they are not afraid of any arrests and walk freely around Limassol with no guard .\nAnd they also do business there .\nAnd their business is not limited to betting .\nLike in Bryansk , they are buying up land in Cyprus and are engaged in the construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are building their own 22-story office , which will house 1XBet developers .\nThey openly talked about this with the russian edition of Forbes and even invited the reporter to the construction site .\nThey are also organizing the Beon1x music festival in Cyprus , where the world \u2019 s best DJs are invited to play .\nThis is considered the necessary \u201c social contribution \u201d to the development of Cyprus , and this helps the 1XBet founders to work on the island freely and receive the local authorities ` support .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer have any problems either .\nThe company \u2019 s beneficiaries mysteriously disappeared from the criminal case , and only the nominal owners ended up in prison .\nIt can be linked to the sponsorship contract concluded between 1XBet and the russian FC Dynamo .\nBookmakers have paid more than 500 million rubles for the contract , although its market value does not exceed 120 million .\nGiven that FC Dynamo belongs to the russian security forces through VTB Bank , such a contract is a typical bribe solving problems of 1XBet owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have any problems in russia and feel safe there can be proven by another fact : despite the blocking of 1XBet websites in russia , another group product , 1xStavka , continues to operate without hindrance from law enforcement and state regulators .\nSemikohin and Karshkov have a favorable position .\nOn the one hand , they do not deny that 1XBet is their business .\nThey even brag about it .\nOn the other hand , they state that they do not own any 1XBet website .\nThey also compare their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributes franchises , and on the ground , the \u201c owners \u201d change it and conduct their activities independently .\nRoman Semiokhin at the construction site of his own 22-storey office in Cyprus .\nIn fact , the founders of 1XBet closely monitor the activities of each resource .\nHowever , this does not save the office from high-profile scandals .\nThe loudest one in recent years was associated with the suspension of 1XBet in 2019 in the UK after an investigation by The Sunday Times .\nThe Gambling Commission , the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times \u2019 publication .\nAs a result , 1XBet has lost its license in Britain .\nChelsea , Liverpool , and Tottenham have received official warnings of prosecution and multimillion-dollar fines if they continue to promote the russian bookmaker brand .\nThis case was the first significant intervention of the regulator in the financing of clubs by the gaming industry .\nThe executive director of London-based White Bullet Solutions , which works with public , legal and private clients on intellectual property theft , said 1XBet is in the sights of law enforcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost its license in Kenya , where it has been convicted of promoting and engaging young people in gambling .\nThe bookmaker faces the same problem in the United States .\nWith no permission to operate , 1XBet tried to attract US players to its resource by offering a registration bonus of more than $ 100 .\nBlocking sites generated multi-step instructions for connecting to the system .\nThe russian bookmaker has worked for years in many other jurisdictions with help of this scheme .\nAnd then , 1XBet was noticed by representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among other things , they analyze the piracy threats .\nPreviously , they only reported about pirated sites , mobile applications , streaming services , and hosters .\nIn 2019 , they introduced a new section : \u201c Ad networks and online advertising entities.\n\u201d There was only one name in it \u2013 1XBet ( russia ) .\nThe brand has been accused of mass advertising on pirated resources and promoting piracy around the world .\nSince then , 1XBet has been a regular contributor to the MPA report submitted to the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington .\nThe latest report in this regard is dated October 2021 .\nAfter these incidents , Semiokhin and Karshkov \u2019 s business began to face difficulties with banking institutions and partners worldwide .\nDue to the lack of transparency in financial transactions , 1XBet uses cryptocurrencies and other financial engineering solutions instead of bank accounts .\nThe Ukrainian regulator , the Commission for the regulation of gambling and lotteries , did not notice this either , as it did not notice the russian founders of the company either .\nHow 1XBet paved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without corruption , a russian company with such a background would never have acquired a license in Ukraine during the full-scale russian invasion .\nEven at the stage of legalization of gambling in Ukraine , experts said that the bill was drawn up in the interests of russian betting and gambling companies .\nIn particular , in the interests of 1XBet .\nLatvian citizen Boris Baum lobbied it .\nLater , he became the gray cardinal of the gambling market of Ukraine , which still has a decisive say in licensing .\nOfficially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Deputy Chairman of the Commission for regulating gambling and lotteries ( from now on referred to as KRAIL ) Advisory and Expert Council .\nBaum has been closely associated with the russian \u201c businessman \u201d since the 1990s and now with the State Duma deputy , deputy head of the State Duma , and Putin \u2019 s special envoy Alexander Babakov .\nHe used to be known as a member of the russian organized crime group called Luzhnikovskaya ( Luzhnikovs ) .\nThe connection between Baum and Babakov can be traced through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Energy , where Baum worked as a top manager .\nUntil 2021 , it was controlled by russian businessmen Alexander Babakov , Evgeny Giner , and Mikhail Voevodin .\nVS Energy in Ukraine controls several energy companies .\nThese are Zhytomyroblenerho , Zakarpattyaoblenerho , Kirovogradoblenerho , Khersonoblenerho , Rivneoblenerho , Chernivtsioblenerho , and Khmelnytskoblenerho .\nBut this is not the only connection between Baum and Babakov .\nIn 2006 , there was a loud scandal associated with a raid on the Rus Hotel in Kyiv downtown .\n\u201c Mobile phones were confiscated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked up .\nThe intruders broke down doors and computers .\nThe affair was supervised by Oleg Bolotov , the general manager of the Babakov-owned Premier hotel chain , \u201d the journalists wrote at the time .\nAnd Boris Baum was mentioned as the chairman of the supervisory board of the First Investment Bank \u2013 allegedly , the agreement to buy the hotel with him had already been agreed .\nAs it turned out , Baum was not only a banker but also the owner of three offshore companies : Banita Limited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 2008 , the Rus hotel complex was registered with these companies .\nBaum \u2019 s offshore companies are also involved in a criminal case of illegally withdrawing money related to VS Energy .\nAnother bright representative of the Luzhnikovs is Mikhail Spektor .\nUntil 2015 , he controlled virtually all activities of the russian group in Ukraine and was president of VS Energy .\nHe is described in the media as a well-known crisis manager .\nHe used to be a manager of Boris Baum as well .\nMikhail Spektor is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was partnering a project with Pari Match in Africa .\nHow russian business acquires licenses in Ukraine during the war Boris Baum has helped establish contact between Semiokhin , Karshkov , and Mikhail Spektor .\nNow , the latter is responsible for the success of 1XBet in Ukraine and promotes the interests of the russian founders of the project .\nSpektor hired Serhiy Tsybin as a nominal owner and manager for the legal entity Your Betting Company LLC to receive a license for 1XBet .\nSerhiy Tarasyuk , a lawyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In KRAIL , Spektor had Baum \u2019 s support .\nAnd at the beginning of the year , this would be enough to get licenses .\nBut the documents for applying for one license were ready only in February , and for the second one in March 2022 .\nSo , the war adjusted the plans .\nIt became much more difficult for the russian brand to enter the Ukrainian market officially .\nTo promote the issue of a license for 1XBet in KRAIL , Boris Baum said that after receiving the license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government bonds for 500 million hryvnias .\nAnd it worked .\nOn March 30 , the regulator issued licenses for bookmaking and organization of online gambling to Your Betting Company LLC .\nAfter the desire to buy military bonds , one would like to believe that the \u201c Ukrainian \u201d 1XBet is indeed Ukrainian and has nothing to do with the russians Semiokhin and Karshkov .\nBut there is an aspect .\nFrom 1XBet , another proposal was to allow accepting bets from non-resident players of Ukraine and to introduce preferential taxation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-residents through Ukrainian companies , the bookmaker is ready to pay 3 % of turnover to the budget and buy domestic government bonds for 20 % of profits .\nIt would seem that another initiative was aimed at the country \u2019 s economic development during the war .\nSuch a proposal attempts to cover the long-standing pain of Semiokhin and Karshkov associated with activities in different markets .\nOne of the world \u2019 s most popular gambling licenses is the Curacao license .\nThere are two types : Master license and Sublicense .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to third parties .\n1XBet has been trying unsuccessfully to obtain a Master license for many years .\nThis significantly limits the company \u2019 s ability to build a network of partner brands .\nAs an alternative , the founders of 1XBet came up with another scheme : to enter new legal markets and create conditions similar to the Master license .\nSuch an attempt is currently taking place in Ukraine .\nBy working with non-residents , 1XBet could expand its operations worldwide and launder funds from operations conducted outside Ukraine .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the connection of the Ukrainian 1XBet with Semiokhin

as patriotic as they may , upon closer look , however , many of such political resolutions and declarations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fact checking .\nFor starters , at the beginning of the war Viktor Orb\u00e1n had prohibited not only any form of military aid to Ukraine but even military aid of other countries to have their logistic ways pass through Hungary .\nIt was explained as a precaution of

and terror as the main pillars for own sustainment .\nThe worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can \u2019 t be confined within borders of the states that gave them birth .\nThey will always expand and bring terror and misery to their weaker neighbors and whomever they can reach until someone else will stop them .\nThis is exactly what is happening now in Ukraine .\nBy starting biggest European war russia has brought back to the Europe all that terror , cruelty and devastation that has so deeply harmed millions of people worldwide in previous century .\nTerror of being indiscriminately killed by missile , artillery shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city being invaded , your freedom stripped , your home ruined , and your belongings robbed .\nTerror of basic necessities kids being kidnapped and deported to far away hostile lands .\nTerror of being subjected to any possible kind of atrocity including raping , torturing and arbitrary executions .\nTerror of never seeing your family member again\u2026 And as if it was not enough to satisfy russian inhuman regime , all those horrendous and unthinkable war crimes are accompanied by blatant and abominable lies .\nIn the russian mass media and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own families and shelling their own homes , destroying schools where their kids were studying and hospitals where their relatives were staying .\nto rob even the dead of their right to find final justice .\nThey portray civilian building as military bases , innocent victims as crazy nazis .\nEffectively , after killing Ukrainian people russian occupiers by the means of propaganda are trying to deny the whole lives of their victims by saying : \u201c if they die by our weapons \u2013 it means they are fascists \u201d .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this war , which they repeat every time after shelling hospitals , schools , railway stations , residential buildings , churches , theaters .\nFortunately , no one in the world believes russian propaganda anymore .\nWell , no one except such dictators as Alexander Lukashenko , Isaias Afwerki , Kim Jong-un , Bashar al-Assad and unexpectedly\u2026 Prime minister of Hungary Viktor Orb\u00e1n .\nAccording to many sources it was the latter who tried to adopt russian rhetoric about Bucha massacre being a put-up affair but didn \u2019 t have courage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nJust let \u2019 s imagine what would Hungarians feel if they were told that those horrendous , tragic events that they had experienced during communist reign in the previous century were faked , blown out of proportion or need more proof to be valid .\nThe answer is simple \u2013 it is utterly offending and immoral .\nThis is how Ukrainians feel about Hungarian Prime Minister , who never ceased to present his indifference to the growing death toll in Ukraine as some diplomatic win .\nFor instance \u2013 on how Hungarians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices amid growing prices in the EU .\nAll they need to do is to pretend that nothing unusual is happening across their eastern border .\nReturning to the subject of historical museums , one of their main purposes is to provide lessons to future generations .\nJust like House of Terror is created so that tragic stories of those who were persecuted , tortured or killed should be always remembered , it also warns against any attempts to establish and support communist , fascist and alike regimes .\nAlas , so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this regard as well \u2013 despite his assistance in opening of the museum , it looks like he never shared its purpose .\nAll in all , whether it is really Hungary that has no alternatives beside russian oil and gas or Victor Orban himself who has no alternatives but rubles to satisfy his greed and power addiction \u2013 it will be determined later by experts in economy , political scientists and regular Hungarian people in the first place .\nAs for us , Ukrainians , it is imperative that after we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up our own grand memorial .\nThere we will gather chronicles of the of our warriors , rescuers , medical personnel and volunteers .\nCollect thousands of , who were forced to flee their ancestor lands , and compatriots , who had suffered russian

Russia and it will receive data of Ukrainians", "content": "A month ago , we published an OSINT study on how the Russian bookmaker 1XBet obtained a license to operate in Ukraine during the war , and who promoted the interests of the Russians .\nThe study provoked a significant response in the Ukrainian media space and interested journalists from Poland , Lithuania and Great Britain .\nThe petition to the President of Ukraine to revoke the 1XBet license has already received the necessary 26,000 votes .\nThe Bureau of Economic Security of Ukraine has begun checking gambling business operators for ties with the Russian Federation , and the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gambling and Lottery Regulatory Commission ) has dissolved its Expert Council .\nBut all this has not affected the license of the Russian bookmaker in Ukraine .\nIn a new study , we will demonstrate how 1XBet works in Russia and how it will get personal data of Ukrainians .\nAfter the first investigation , some interested individuals spoke about the fact that 1XBet allegedly does not work in Russia and has no relations with the aggressor country .\nIf these connections were established , then the license would be worth withdrawing .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and companies associated with it should fall under the sanctions of the National Security and Defence Council .\nWhile there is no such evidence , this is all \u201c an attempt to cast a shadow on the market and reform of gambling in Ukraine.\n\u201d This is exactly what Borys Baum , listed on the Myrotvorets website , who has long been called the gray cardinal of the Ukrainian gambling market , wrote on his personal Facebook page in an effort to protect 1XBet .\nAfter the scandal with 1XBet , Baum was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisory and expert board , in which he was the deputy chairman .\nBut he still remains an adviser to the deputy head of the Office of the President Kyryl Tymoshenko .\nWe hope that this will not be for long .\nBecause 1XBet , whose interests he so ardently defends , continues to work freely in Russia with the consent of the FSB .\nTherefore , lobbying interests and issuing a license to this brand in Ukraine is a crime against national security and an attempt to provide personal data of Ukrainians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important in view of the fact that soon 1XBet will get access to this data .\nWhy are we sure that 1XBet continues to work on the Russian market ?\nWe present a number of arguments based on data obtained from open sources .\n1XBet is a sponsor of anti-Ukrainian propaganda in the Russian Federation On June 21 , 2022 , a recording of the Russian rap battle \u201c 140 BPM \u201d was shown in the \u201c Evening \u201d program on the YouTube channel \u201c Khodorkovsky LIVE \u201d .\nOn it , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of 1XBet and surrounded by women with similar symbols reads the beat how \u201c armed Azov battalion was sitting in the kindergarten \u201d and how allegedly Ukrainians \u201c bombed old people , children and others \u201d in Donbas , and other relatable Russian propaganda .\nAccording to records on other YouTube channels , the recording of the program took place on May 29 , 2022 .\nThe main target audience of such programs with a combination of propaganda and Russian rap is Russian youth .\nAnd this video serves as a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a license to operate in Ukraine , is interested in marketing on the Russian market , works in Russia and provides Russians with platforms for anti-Ukrainian propaganda .\n1XBet \u2013 works with most Russian banks and payment systems Another confirmation of the presence of 1XBet in the Russian Federation is banking operations .\nIn Russia , there is a Badbank Telegram channel , which specializes in publishing leaks about banks that are engaged in acquiring casino payments .\nThe information published there is quite easy to verify due to the large number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ query \u201c 1xbet \u201d , the channel produces 79 publications .\nThe last of them is dated July 11 , 2022 and shows that payments for the bookmaker are made by the MTS-Money service .\nOther acquirers include Sberbank of Russia , Tinkoff , AlfaBank , Qiwi , and other Russian banks and payment systems .\nIf 1XBet does not work in Russia , how and why does it make payments through Russian banks ?\nThe answer to this question is obvious \u2013 1XBet works in Russia .\nThis applies both to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of mirrors and subsidiary sites .\n1XBet and 1XStavka are one bookmaker office .\nSoftware analysis During the preparation of the preliminary study , we spoke extensively with specialists in the field of gambling .\nThe only thing that experts agree on 100 % is that all operators approach the development of their own software with great sensitivity and protect it from copying .\nThe code can show where the operator works , who is the author of the gambling or betting site , which libraries are used in the software , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operator \u2019 s partners .\nVolunteers from the BraveUkraine group conducted a large-scale comparative study of gambling sites and mobile applications and published the results on Github .\nAmong the studied resources are 1XBet and 1XStavka .\nThe latter officially works in the Russian Federation and , allegedly , has no connection with 1XBet and its owners .\nHowever , the code shows the opposite .\nDuring the study , volunteers compared the design , technology stack of websites , backend and mobile applications ( Android , iOS ) .\nThe visual similarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNot only logos , but also the main page , content and various forms for users .\nBut , apart from that , the resources have a completely identical set of libraries and API services .\nJS libraries \u2013 full coincidence of set and version of libraries .\nFor comparison , we used the API requests that were sent from the frontends of the sites during registration , login , password recovery and receiving lists of sports events .\nIn the comparison table there is a 100 % match of the API @ @ @ @ @ @ @ websites .\nMore than 10,000 files and a set of used libraries in APK files completely coincide in the mobile applications of the two Android platforms .\nContents of unpacked applications \u2013 most of the files match .\n\u2022 None The number of files in both applications is almost the same ( the difference is 2334 files ) .\n\u2022 None The number of absolutely identical files in .APK is 10,774 .\n\u2022 None All indications show that the applications use exactly the same libraries ( below ) .\nDifferences in graphic files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-app messages ) customized for the respective brand .\nApplications in IOS are visually almost completely identical .\nAnd even with the same frameworks and libraries .\nThe conclusions of this analysis indicate an almost complete coincidence of software , raw data for its development and technical support .\nAnd this means that 1XStavka , without even hiding it , uses 1XBet technologies .\nThe owners of the Russian bookmaker , Roman Semiokhin and Serhiy Karshkov , told the Russian Forbes in an interview that all technical work with the platform is conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serhii Karshkov .\nSo without his participation , 1XStavka would not exist .\nThis once again indicates the close ties of the owners of 1XBet with Russia and the unhindered work of the bookmaker group on the territory of the Russian Federation .\nIn addition to 1XBet and 1XStavka , BraveUkraine volunteers also compared other platforms operating in Ukraine , whether they could pose a potential threat to our country by operating in the Russian Federation .\nIn particular , FavBet and Fonbet , Pari-Match and Pari.ru , Fonbet and Pari.ru .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only two platforms , Fonbet and Pari.ru .\nFonbet does not have a license in Ukraine , but , like most operators , continues to conduct illegal activities in the country .\nAs for FavBet and Pari-Match , analysis of the software showed that it is not similar to the one used in the Russian Federation .\nBut it is not registered on Ukrainian companies .\nThis means that operators do not pay taxes in Ukraine .\nBES ( Bureau of Economic Security of Ukraine ) should pay attention to this when checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fonbet must stop their activity .\nBecause it is impossible to work on the Russian market without connections in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation .\nAnd the loyalty of the FSB must be repaid with something .\nToday , this is the personal data of Ukrainians , which we will talk about a little later .\nAs far as we know , the SBU is already looking into the situation with 1XBet .\nBut why did counter-intelligence agents start work only now ?\nAccording to our data , this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who started 1XBet in Ukraine back in 2016-2017 .\nThe resignation took place after the suspension , and later detention in Serbia on suspicion of treason , of Andriy Naumov , the ex-head of the State Security Directorate of the SBU .\nTogether with Naumov , his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s lost their positions , one of whom was Artem Shilo .\nFor many years , he held the position of deputy , and later acting head of the department of counterintelligence protection of state interests in the field of information security ( DKIB ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media , Shilo was one of the key people associated with pressure on Ukrainian IT companies between 2016 and 2019 .\nAt the same time , for many years he was involved in the development and implementation of schemes related to the gaming business , including from Russia .\nWhy does 1XBet want to enter the Ukrainian market ?\nAs you can see , the Russian bookmaker operator has been trying to work in Ukraine for many years and has a great interest in the Ukrainian market .\nUnfortunately , it may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a high probability that 1XBet wants to get personal data of Ukrainians and direct access to players more than money .\nGambling is a risk .\nPeople lose money .\nOften \u2013 big money .\nWith a database of people with major financial problems , it is very easy to recruit agents on the ground and use them for the needs of the GRU and the FSB .\nBut how will 1XBet get the personal data of the players ?\nThe thing is that they have received permission , moreover , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license to operate in Ukraine .\nThe Law \u201c About state regulation of activities for the organization and carrying out gambling \u201d in Art .\n16 requires operators to \u201c ensure

25 , 2020 ) In a piece with such a peremptory title , the author refers to The Lancet journal .\nThe journal was frequently cited in Russia during the pandemic , its articles covered not only the

available data on phase III trials of Sputnik V and the conclusions drawn from them about the efficacy and safety of the vaccine .\nIt was reported by Radio Liberty .\n\u201c In an open letter published by The Lancet , scientists , including a Russian specialist , analyzed the data on trials of the Russian vaccine published earlier in the same journal .\nIts developer , the Gamaleya Research Centre , claimed that the efficacy of Sputnik exceeded 91 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d \u201c The authors of the critical piece , after analyzing the arguments of the developers of the vaccine , write about the many inconsistencies in the data presented , a number of unusual and suspicious coincidences ( in particular , the vaccine , according to the official data , showing almost the same efficacy for all age groups .\nThey mathematically showed that the same efficacy of the vaccine claimed for different age groups casts doubt on the authenticity of the data presented and may indicate falsification ) , the lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V trials and clear rules for its conduct .\nThe main source of their concern , however , is that a range of vital trial data have not been published , without which , according to the authors , it is impossible to objectively evaluate the results .\n\u201d \u201c The piece in The Lancet medical journal has become one of the arguments for both Russian authorities and politicians from a number of countries around the world , including the EU , to declare the Russian drug reliable .\nContracts for its supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although so far , unlike six other vaccines , it has not been officially approved by the WHO.\n\u201d This was also facilitated by an article by Andrew Kramer that had global reach by the virtue of being published in The New York Times .\nAnd as a cherry on top of the Kremlin \u2019 s promotion of Sputnik-V , came an article by Andrew Kramer , which was subsequently used left , right , and center to promote the vaccine in different countries .\nThe article was mentioned and cited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That specific report covered the fact that an American journalist took Sputnik-V in Moscow .\nThat journalist was Andrew Kramer .\nAfter vaccination , he became a frequent guest on the air of Russian and Western media , where he promoted narratives like this : \u201c the politicized rollout only served to obscure the essentially good trial results \u2014 what appears to be a bona fide accomplishment for Russian scientists continuing a long and storied practice of vaccine development .\nIn the Soviet period ,

\u201c Shoppers want to know\u2026 where the jewels on their engagement rings are dug up\u2026 \u201c , so he authored a feature looking like nothing short of an advertorial in the interests of the

processing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEO of Alrosa is Sergey Sergeyevich Ivanov ( son of a well-known high-ranking KGB/SVR officer Sergey Borisovich Ivanov ) .\nAlrosa mines 95 % of all diamonds in Russia , one

USSR Yazov ( 2020 ) and many other generals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOfficials of the Soviet era and officials of the Putin period also find their last resting place there .\nBack in the day , during the

that did not make it to Syria landed at this cemetery .\nHowever , Russian society is very caste-ridden .\nTherefore , not every general , even formally fitting the criteria for a burial at the

of belonging to an elite .\nLast year , there were about 300 graves at the Pantheon .\nAll burials were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained a Wikipedia page for the burial site .\nHowever , with the outbreak of the war , the Russians suddenly stopped updating the official website , although new graves were steadily added to the cemetery , with bodies coming from the war with Ukraine .\nSo , on June 7 , Major

Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic ( DPR ) , Hero of Russia .\nOn July 6 , certain Senior Lieutenant Maxim Yeshchenko was buried there too , just a company commander of the 18th Motorized Rifle Division of the 11th Army Corps of the Baltic Fleet .\nAn ordinary position and no special victories .\nWhy would other Russian \u201c heroes \u201d from the periphery be buried in their native villages and

in this cemetery for the captain of the Main Intelligence Directorate ( GRU ) special ops forces Vitaly Kokorin , who was killed in action somewhere in Ukraine on May 31 ( link to VK , archive ) .\nHe was born in Mytishchi , where this very cemetery is located .\nIn the photographs from the funeral , a whole area with new burials is visible , and even several names are legible on the fresh graves

intensifying repressions in the Russian Federation , completed its work .\nThe delegates , after heated discussions and disputes , adopted high-profile resolutions : on new goals and objectives of the national movement , which include the struggle for independence and the secession of the Erzya territories from the Russian Federation , the approval of the desired borders , as well as the key principles for building a new state entity .\nErzya is one of the most numerous Finno-Ugric peoples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Volga region .\nIn the course of the All-Russian population censuses , the Erzya are often recorded under the exonym \u201c Mordva \u201d , uniting them in one national group with the Mokshans .\nThis unification complicates the calculation of the Erzya .\nThe total number is about 500 thousand people .\nThe Erzya language is a Finno-Ugric language of the Finno-Volga group , one of the three official languages \u200b\u200bof the Republic of Mordovia , along with Moksha and Russian .\nThey profess Christianity ( Orthodoxy and Lutheranism ) , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ineshkipaziya .\nThey are one of the few peoples enslaved by Moscow that have their own system of national representative bodies .\nIt consists of a congress of delegates from the Erzya political parties and public associations Videkuro ( erz .\nVidekuro ) .\nTogether , these bodies of national self-government are called Kirdiyur ( Erz .\nKirdijur ) .\nThe Erzya National Movement has officially condemned the unleashing of a war against Ukraine by the Russian authorities three times : once in 2014 and twice in 2022 .\nArson of the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mordovia ) , as well as the distribution of anti-war leaflets in Saransk in July 2022 , are associated with the Erzya underground .\nThere are Erzya volunteers fighting in Ukraine against the RF Armed Forces , there is confirmed data on losses among Erzya fighters .\nAt the beginning the Russian authorities tried to take control of the key organs of Kirdiyyur through intimidation and persecution of activists , and having failed , they created parallel representative bodies headed by public sector workers , that is , people dependent on the authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repressions in our native lands , the creation by Moscow of fake structures for the self-organization of our people , as well as new military-political challenges in the Russian Federation that prompted us to immediately convene the Congress on emigration .\nWe ` ve prepared it in record time less than three months .\nThere were no discussions about the venue of the Congress .\nEstonia is the rising dawn of the Finno-Ugric world , our intercessor and our hope .\nThe Estonian people are our kindred people , we came from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as Turkey is not a foreign state for Azerbaijanis , so Estonia is not a distant land for us , \u201d explains Vitaly Romashkin , Chairman of the Organizing Committee for the convocation of the congress .\nOn the morning of September 30 , the leadership of the parish , Estonian politicians and cultural figures , journalists and scientists arrived in Otep\u00e4\u00e4 .\nThe whole city was hung with Estonian and Erzya flags .\nThe cult of the national flag in Otep\u00e4\u00e4 is felt very expressively \u2013 the first Estonian flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1884 .\nThe opening of the Congress was marked by a ceremony of raising the flag of Estonia and the Erzya national flag , for the use of which this year the FSB and the police began to persecute the Erzyans in their homeland in the Republic of Mordovia .\nThe meeting in the conference hall began with a minute of silence , honoring the memory of the Erzya warrior a soldier of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Oleksiy Veshchevailov , who planned to go to the Congress as a delegate , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Russians in the Bakhmut direction in the Donetsk region of Ukraine .\nAlos other Erzya warriors fighting on the side of Ukraine were supposed to go to Otep\u00e4ya to represent the Erzya military brotherhood .\nOne of them did manage to get a 4-day layoff and get to Estonia .\nWhen a young Erzya in the uniform of a soldier of the Armed Forces of Ukraine entered the conference hall , he instantly drew the attention of the press and the Estonian public .\n\u201c The importance of this event for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , our people found themselves behind the Iron Curtain .\nMore than a third of the delegates could not get to the Congress.The Russian authorities put pressure even on those Erzya who remained in the Russian Federation and were involved in the preparation and holding of the Congress remotely .\nThere were people who could not cross all the borders and did not get to Estonia .\nHowever , despite all the obstacles , we were able to convene the Congress and involve not only elders , but also young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a fighter of the Armed Forces of Ukraine , a young veteran from Erzya .\nVery acute political issues were brought to the attention of the delegates .\nIn particular , a consensus was found on the most difficult topic \u2013 state building .\nThe survival of the Erzya as a people within the Russian Federation is impossible this is the verdict of the delegates .\nThe way out is the creation of the federal state of Erzyan Mastor .\nThe congress recognized the Republic of Mordovia , Penza , Ulyanovsk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as illegitimate territorial-administrative formations , and the \u201c authorities \u201d of these formations bodies without representative functions .\nSuch that they can not represent the multinational population of these territories .\nAfter heated discussions , the delegates stated that the continued presence in the Russian Federation of territories where the Erzya people densely reside means the final disappearance of the Erzya as a people : \u201c Not a single aspect of the policy of the Russian Federation or the Republic of Mordovia is aimed at preserving the Erzya people , their national identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , the policy pursued by the Kremlin towards the Erzya , as well as other Finno-Ugric peoples , is aimed at our speedy dissolution in the Russian ethnos .\nThe Russian Federation is pursuing a policy of covert ethnocide against the Erzya.\n\u201d Erzya not only accused the Russian authorities of hidden ethnocide , but also directly declared their desire to create a separate state , outlining in detail its borders , political regime and state structure : \u201c The preservation of the Erzya people , their development and the realization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights are possible only in an independent state Erzyan Mastor .\nThe creation of the Erzyan Mastor is the main task of the Erzya national movement .\nThe congress sees the state of Erzya as an absolutely independent democratic legal state formation \u2013 the federal republic of Erzyan Mastor .\nIn the state of Erzyan Mastor , the Erzya people exercise their right to self-determination .\nThe state is heading towards building a political nation \u2013 where every citizen of the federation will be an Erzya , regardless of his ethnic origin .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mastor of the right to preserve and develop their national identities , languages \u200b\u200band cultures will be enshrined in the Constitution .\nThe territory of the state will include the lands of the Republic of Mordovia , Penza , Ulyanovsk , parts of the Nizhny Novgorod , Ryazan and Samara regions .\nThe state will have the following administrative structure : 8 cantons ( of which two are Tatar national ) and the autonomous Moksha Republic .\nThe capital of the federation is Saran Osh .\nSeparately there was adopted the political program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Erzyan Mastor as well as the national emblem and the anthem were approved .\nThe well-known activist Arpad Valdazh , who traveled a long distance to get to Estonia , presented to the Congress his own vision of the current state of the Erzya language and guides in the implementation of the humanitarian policy of the independent state of Erzya .\nThe Congress also decided that until the independence of Erzyan Mastor , the struggle of the Erzya people for self-determination is headed by Kirdiyur ( national representative bodies ) and personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erzyans can take part in the formation of Kirdiyyur bodies .\nThe Congress recognizes people as Erzyans who openly and publicly declare their belonging to the Erzya nation and are able to prove their kinship with a person of Erzya origin without regard to the level of family ties .\nAlso , an Erzya is a person who has mastered the Erzya language at a level sufficient for free communication , and recognizes himself as part of the Erzya nation \u2013 without even having a drop of Erzya blood .\nThe delegates confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolyaen and the current composition of Atyan Ezem , obliging them to fulfill their duties until the Promks convene in \u201c an atmosphere of free expression of will and the absence of repression and persecution of Erzya activists.\n\u201d The Erzyans condemned the invasion of the Russian Armed Forces into Ukraine , the mobilization on the lands of indigenous peoples , expressed solidarity with the protesters in Dagestan , Yakutia and other colonial republics , supported the declaration on the decolonization of Russia adopted in Prague on July 23 , 2022 at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and called on all enslaved the peoples of the Russian Federation to fight for the collapse of the empire and the creation of independent states on the occupied lands of these peoples .\nKomi , Karelians , Izhors and Mari took part in the work of the Congress as guests .\nOn the sidelines , Estonian politicians and even the military were seen , who came to Otep\u00e4\u00e4 to hold a series of closed meetings with Inyazor .\nIn general , the Estonian representation at the Congress was very official and representative : @ @ @ @ @ @

The Kremlin begins to decorate Russian cannon fodder", "content": "\u201c Cannon fodder \u201d is a good definition for the numerous Russian volunteer units formed throughout Russia .\nIn order not to waste their professional military , the Russians staked on volunteers from marginalized groups outlawed from conscription in peacetime .\nTo begin with , one should not treat Russian volunteer units lightly .\nThey hate Ukraine with a passion and want easy money \u2013 this is what drives loads of former security and military professionals into war with Ukraine .\nThose are retired ex-military \u2013 almost all of them have already fought somewhere \u2013 Russia never wanted to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are also former policemen among them\u2013 the Russians actively used combined police units in all Chechen wars ; temporary deployments to Chechnya and Dagestan were a common practice for Russian policemen .\nBesides , after the collapse of the USSR , the Russians consistently reduced their army , with hundreds of thousands of former professional servicemen finding themselves at loose ends .\nIn addition to professionals , this war sucked in hundreds of thousands of Russian conscripts with at least some wartime experience .\nConcurrently with the reduction of the army , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security agencies \u2013 the Russian Guard became a kind of a shadow army , the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) put on some additional muscles .\nThanks to Shoigu , his \u201c home \u201d Ministry of Emergency Situations was also reformed .\nOne can add here paramilitary organizations ( such as Cossacks ) , numerous private security companies and the general militarization of the society .\nThat is , there are quite a few people in Russia experienced in weapons handling .\nWork in security agencies and the military has always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent social security benefits , early retirement and relatively easy money .\nBeing conscripted to serve as , say , a paratrooper would open up many social elevators for a Russian man .\nOn the other hand , if you got kicked out of the army due to \u201c failure to fulfill the terms and conditions of the contract \u201d ( FFTC ) , you could no longer have a career in government bodies .\nThere are also formal restrictions on employment in the security agencies , such as age , criminal record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissal .\nSo , millions of Russians who know how to fight and are willing to fight against Ukraine ( or rather \u2013 as they see it \u2013 against \u201c NATO/America \u201d ) were sidelined by official Russian security agencies and the army .\nOne should not belittle the number of Russians who hate Ukraine and Ukrainians simply because Ukraine and Ukrainians exist .\nWhen the all-out war with Ukraine broke out , many Russians were given a great opportunity to join in , bypassing official restrictions .\nIf you are more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 these are effectively state military units which serve the state under a thin \u201c commercial \u201d disguise .\nSome PMCs are closer to the army and some to other government bodies .\nThey have supervisors ; some of them are professional servicemen , most likely the so-called \u201c servicemen on leave \u201d .\nMake no mistake \u2013 these are not private companies .\nLater on , they were joined by people from BARS ( an abbreviation meaning \u201c battle army reserve \u201d ) .\nAll of the above was a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to go into combat on the back of simplified recruitment conditions .\nMilitary units began to offer short-time contracts and recruit even those dismissed due to FFTC .\nThe age limit was raised .\nIn the Russian regions , they began to form volunteer units with virtually no restrictions with regard to those willing to join .\n\u201c No matter who and what you are , come on in \u2013 we \u2019 ll find you a proper unit : we \u2019 ll pay you 200\u041a+ rubles a month and you have our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included into your retirement plan , you \u2019 ll get combat payments , the status of a war veteran and all kinds of regional and federal benefits if you are injured or killed \u201d \u2013 this is what motivates tens of thousands of Russians to go to war with Ukraine as \u201c volunteers \u201d .\nAnd yet , despite all the tall promise , they are cannon fodder and are treated as such .\nFormally , any PMC is a commercial military unit .\nIf you join one , you know full well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on a one fine day , your PMC ceases to legally exist , you are on your own .\nWith BARS fighters and volunteers , things look a bit different .\nOften the signing of a contract is delayed as much as possible ; in many cases the contract is signed when the you are already in the field .\nContracts are signed either with the military unit , or with the relevant department of the Defense Ministry , or with the Defense Ministry \u2019 s Directorate .\nThe devil is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the \u201c contract soldier \u201d is not actually a serviceman but merely a contractor of Russia \u2019 s Defense Ministry , with standard military benefits not at all guaranteed .\nInstead of a salary , you get some kind of financial aid which is provided through a charitable foundation .\nIf the you are wounded , you may be given financial aid through the Ministry of Social Protection rather than through Russia \u2019 s Defense Ministry .\nHere is a telling answer from Russian military medics to one of the mercenaries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face their biggest problems after the war .\nIt may turn out that they do not qualify as official combatants or veterans , their unit has been disbanded , and the financial aid was a one-time benefit , their regional social payments have been cut down .\n\u201c We did not send you there , \u201d is something they are sure to hear from Russian bureaucrats trying to optimize their budgets .\nNo decorations for you Many Russian volunteers are starting to face certain problems already now .\nTheir semi-official status does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection as the official military personnel have , so many are in for the hardest battle after they get wounded .\nNot only wounded \u2013 some Russian volunteers have already bit the dust .\nKIA volunteers began to make their way back to the Russian regions from the early days of the war , not to be buried there as official military personnel , with no memorial plaques put on school walls , no streets named after them .\nAnd , virtually no mentions on local media .\nIf a \u201c volunteer \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank or was once related to the army , he might be decorated with the Order of Courage , a standard Russian military decoration of a serviceman .\nSome PMC mercenaries would get the order from time to time \u2013 another evidence that some of the PMCs are related to the state .\nBut volunteers and \u201c short-term \u201d contract soldiers are not up to this kind of decoration .\nIndeed , if such a posthumous military order were to be awarded to all volunteers , the official military men \u2013 people with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would start to ask questions .\nThat is why in the first months of the war volunteers were buried quietly and with no state honors .\nBut , as the number of casualties grew , the Russian authorities had to react somehow .\nIn July and August , we began to see the first posthumous awards of state honors to Russian volunteers .\nInstead of the order , they were posthumously awarded the Medal For Courage \u2013 a Russian copy of another Soviet award that may be awarded post mortem according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the awardees of the past weeks : \u2022 Alexander Karpenko ( born in Volgograd , 52 years old , LDPR activist , tankman ,

analysis of the first month of Russian mobilization", "content": "On September 21 , 2022 , Putin changed the life of an entire generation of Russian civilians to \u201c before \u201d and \u201c after \u201d mobilization .\nOn the very first day , excited Russian draft officers began delivering the first \u201c good-luck letters \u201d to the newly minted Russian military men .\nRussian military districts raced to fulfill the mobilization targets in order to compensate for the losses in regular units at the expense of \u201c mobiks \u201d .\nThe war from TV and patriotic Telegram channels suddenly entered the actual life of hundreds of thousands of civilian Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protests against it .\nThe protests culminated in a few videos from the Russian outback .\nA typical mobilized Russian is OK with making war on Ukraine , he just used to think that the regular army would take care of it for him .\nThe Russian press published tons of texts on how to legally delay mobilization , but subsequently switched to hints on how to properly prepare a mobilized man for the front \u2013 from advice on how to make a makeshift tourniquet from improvised materials , to checklists with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front .\nRussian society goes to war against Ukraine en masse without any qualms .\nFrom a legal point of view , a mobilized Russian is infinitely worse-off than a contract soldier .\nNow , every Russian can sign a short-term contract with the army for a minimum of 3 months .\nThus , such a \u201c contract soldier \u201d can call it quits after a quarter in the ranks .\nA mobilized Russian remains in the army until the end of the war , but no one knows when it will end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of the mobilized Russians , and therefore they resignedly sign against the receipt of the draft notice .\nThen they just as resignedly come to the draft station , \u201c just to clarify their data \u201d , from where they are promptly taken to the front .\nA whole series of obituaries about the fate of the mobilized Russians has already appeared in the Russian press .\nIn some ways , this is reminiscent of the first weeks of March , when the Russians actively wrote about the first losses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got tired and turned into an everyday reality .\nHowever , the stories of \u201c mobiks \u201d can still be found in the Russian press , because this is a relatively new phenomenon .\nEven Russian journalists want to hype on the topic .\nThe Russian mobilized suffered their first losses from heart attacks at mobilization stations , some showed extraordinary alcoholic prowess in training camps or died due to hazing before reaching the army .\nA separate case is the execution of a group of mobilized men by the ethnic Tajiks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact losses in this story are unclear .\nAlso several videos circulated the press of the relatives searching for missing mobilized men who have not been in contact for a long time after mobilization .\nOn September 22 , Russian military draft offices began to deliver the first draft notices .\nSome were drafted into the army on the very first day and taken to training camps throughout Russia .\nFor many , the way to the front took only a few days , and already in Ukraine , the Russian mobilized men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nDuring the first month of mobilization , the names of at least 29 mobilized Russians killed at the front became known \u2013 information about them somehow made its way to the press or social media .\nThe Ukrainian OSINT expert \u201c Necro Mancer \u201d ( Twitter account : @ 666_mancer ) is gathering data of the Russian losses at the front .\nAfter analyzing the texts of obituaries , we supplemented the results of Necro Mancer with the dates of mobilization and the dates of arrival in Ukraine .\nSo , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action look like ?\nThe average age of a killed \u201c mobik \u201d is only 33 years .\nMost of them are privates or corporals .\nSo far , only one killed officer in the rank of major has been recorded .\nMany of them do not need initial military training because they have recently discharged from the army or worked in law enforcement agencies .\nSome were paratroopers , military intelligence officers , special forces soldiers or marines .\nSome of them fought in Chechnya , served as a contract soldiers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caucasus , worked for the police or the penitentiary system .\nThat is , the killed Russian mobilized men are in a sense military men .\nFor example , a mobilized with the surname Khomichenko from Buryatia went to fight against Ukraine for the second time this year .\nUntil June , he had already fought as part of the Russian regular army , and in September he landed for the second time in Ukraine , already as a mobilized soldier .\nBy the way , about Buryatia .\nThe draft officers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine faster than others .\nThe leaders in disposal of the mobilized were the Krasnoyarsk Krai and Sverdlovsk Oblast ( 7 pcs .\neach ) , closely followed by the Chelyabinsk Oblast ( with 5 pcs. )\n.\nLet us separately mark the capital regions \u2013 Moscow ( 3 ) and St. Petersburg ( 2 ) .\nEvery fifth Russian lives in the agglomerations of these two cities \u2013 mobilization could not have bypassed the metropolitan party-goers .\nAll the KIAs were called up in the first week of mobilization in September , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourth of October .\nOn the average , a mobilized man gets to Ukraine in just 7 days .\nHowever , there are also exceptions , when , within an express procedure , a \u201c mobik \u201d got to Ukraine on the third day after mobilization .\nWe could trace two main routes of getting into Ukraine through the obituaries .\nFirst \u2013 a training camp in Dzhankoy in the Crimea , followed by redeployment to the Kherson Oblast , or it could start with the Belgorod or Rostov Oblast , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oblast of Ukraine .\nIt is interesting that some of those mobilized subsequently go again from the Luhansk to the Kherson Oblast .\nIt was possible to establish the place of death for 16 mobilized men .\nThe majority die in the Kherson Oblast \u2013 12 out of 16 in our data sample .\nAnd 4 pcs .\nwere liquidated in the Luhansk Oblast .\nThere is no information on the killed mobilized men in the Donbas yet .\nWe could partially establish the date of mobilization and arrival in Ukraine .\nFrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be drawn \u2013 a week after mobilization , a Russian \u201c mobik \u201d normally enters Ukraine .\nAfter 12 days upon mobilization , he dies in Ukraine .\nHe manages to survive for about 4 days at the front .\nThe Armed Forces of Ukraine do not forgive the Russians for the desire to wage war on Ukraine .\nThe \u201c sad \u201d statistics of the first KIA mobilized roughly shows how a typical Russian mobilized man will fare against the motivated Ukrainian army .\nOn average \u2013 4 days to live , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POW .\nBy Anton

, it is still possible to install and use Russian navigation applications like 2-GIS , Yandex Maps and Navigator by using a VPN .\nWe have reasonable grounds to believe that these applications are controlled by the government of the aggressor country , and that through these applications , the Russian government receives online information about the situation on Ukrainian roads , passage of military equipment , and even entrances and exits to any building .\nAnd they do not need to hire an army of spies , as this information is collected and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Around 15 % , or every seventh driver in Ukraine , uses Russian mobile navigators , according to a study by the Association of Responsible Carriers ( ARC ) .\nThe ARC has repeatedly appealed to the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine ( NSDC ) , the Ministry of Internal Affairs , and the Security Service of Ukraine to block their operation in the territory of Ukraine , however , apart from letters addressed to mobile app stores , the relevant structures have not yet taken any meaningful action .\nRussian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navigator , are still available for download and are actively used via VPN in Ukraine despite the sanctions and the total expulsion of Russian business from country .\nThe applications receive and can transmit a lot of data about Ukrainian cities , including critical infrastructure facilities , military movements , or places mass gathering .\nA driver may not even know that he has become a spy \u2013 it is enough to drive past a place of interest with the navigator turned on to pass on the data .\nAccording to the ARC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the phones of motorists in Kharkiv , Odesa an Dnipro , accounting for from 42 % to 58 % of such users .\nHow do these apps belong to the Russian government ?\nThe owners of these applications do not hide their Russian roots .\nApp Store and Google Play pages of 2-GIS maps and navigator offline application showed that the app was developed by the company Urbi Gulf FZ-LLC registered in the UAE .\nThe publicly available Privacy Policy states that personal data is processed by the Cypriot company 2GIS LOCAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the ARC , are Aleksandr Sysoyev , a Russian citizen , and state-owned Sberbank of Russia .\nIn addition , the head office of OOO DublGIS which provides a free software license to 2-GIS , is located in Novosibirsk , Russia .\nIn June 2020 , Sberbank acquired a 72 % stake in the company that developed the application , whereas another 3 % of its shares belong to O2O Holding LLC , a joint venture of Sberbank and Mail.ru Group .\nThere is even a site https : //2gis.ua/kyiv which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the height of buildings as well as entrances and exits from them .\nThe 2-GIS website claims that it continues to work in Kyiv Yandex Maps and Navigator has long been known in Ukraine .\nThe Privacy Policy states that the administrator of personal data is Yandex LLC , registered in the Russian Federation .\nIt also indirectly belongs to Serbank of Russia .\nBoth Yandex and 2GIS are listed in the Register of Information Dissemination Organizers and in accordance with the Russian Federal Law On Information must not only store information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also upon request transfer all received data to the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation .\nThis means that any information \u201c seen \u201d by the navigator can be studied by the military of the aggressor country after a few minutes .\nThis is especially dangerous when Russian navigators are used by volunteers traveling to the front lines , military personnel , or critical infrastructure workers .\nThe issue of such intelligence data gathering has become even more critical in connection with the Russian strikes using kamikaze drones which rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a predetermined route , just like car navigators .\nWhat to do in such a situation ?\nThe use of Russian navigators in Ukraine has become a matter of life and safety .\nRegular missile attacks and the use of kamikaze drones means that the enemy is constantly looking for new targets to attack .\nThey are extremely interested in the busy roads and bridges , places where servicemen go to work , and where the chief engineer of a thermal power plant goes .\nTherefore , immediate stop in the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of personal security of every Ukrainian .\nThe ARC appealed to law enforcement agencies with a request to influence the situation and ban the work of Russian geospatial data aggregators in Ukraine .\nARC also made its second appeal to the NSDC .\nHowever , there has been no reaction yet .\nAt the end of September , the Ministry of Digital Transformation informed the ARC about its appeal to Google and Apple corporations to help solve the problem and ban these mobile applications .\nHowever , the situation has not changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still can be downloaded and used through VPN services .\nThe reasons for the authorities \u2019 lack of decisive action are both legal and purely technical .\nTherefore , in practice , the problem has not yet been solved .\nFor example , Russian companies , even those already sanctioned , actively circumvent restrictions by involving intermediaries .\nTechnically , despite blocking access to the relevant servers from Ukraine , VPN services help bypass the restrictions \u2013 and more than 15 % of drivers in Ukraine do it , either knowingly or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attachment of our drivers to Russian navigator apps can only be explained by poor information and misunderstanding that a Russian Shaheed may be flying by their route on Yandex tomorrow .\nTherefore , in addition to the government action , it is necessary to better inform drivers about the risks associated with the use of Russian navigators .\nTaxi and courier services can also facilitate this process .\nFor example , Uklon taxi service does not provide access to Russian applications such as Yandex , 2GIS , CityGuide and Navitel when processing orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are compelled to familiarize themselves with alternative navigators to work in the Uklon Driver application .\nHowever commendable , such responsible action on the part of businesses is not sufficient to fundamentally change the situation \u2013 a broad synergy of efforts from the state authorities and society is needed .\nUkrainian drivers should understand the risk of using Russian navigators and remove them from their gadgets .\nIf most consumers opt out of this software , it will minimize its harmful impact and strengthen the country \u2019 s security .\nRead more on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1XBet created a network to collect personal data of Ukrainians : MelBet , PointLoto , FanSport ,
