recipes for hot water enhancements .\nOne of the classic Ayurvedic hydration , detox and rejuvenation therapies is to regularly consume hot water , or garam pani .\nFrom the Ayurvedic perspective , warm or hot water cleanses and hydrates the digestive tract , and stimulates and scrubs the lymphatic system .\nWarm or hot water also enhances the quality of ahara rasa , which is the first nutrient fluid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the digestive fire , or agni , in the stomach ( pachaka ) and digestive enzymes ( ranjaka ) in the liver .\nThis allows for a more efficient breakdown and assimilation of nutrients and the removal of toxic material ( ama ) .\nAma is the accumulation of undigested food particles that irritate , inflame , and compromise the function of the intestinal lining as a protective barrier .\nAma can find its way into tissues via the circulatory system ( srotas ) .\nHot water vasodilates the srotas in the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cellular ama .\nHow to Use Hot Water Therapies Ayurveda suggests boiling water for at least 10 minutes , as this changes the subtle properties of the water making it easier to assimilate into the body .\nWhile beneficial in any season , drinking hot or warm water is particular good in the winter and spring to help balance vata and kapha .\nThe heat balances the coldness of vata as well as the heaviness and congestion of kapha , while cold water would be aggravating .\nHot water in the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vasodilation of the tissues , supporting dissipation of heat .\nTo help the hot water remove seasonal ama more effectively , the water can be enhanced with some herbs and spices .\nDetox Therapy : Take sips every 15-20 minutes for two weeks .\nMaintenance Therapy : Sip hot water with meals and every couple of hours throughout the day NOTE : Heat the water like tea , making sure it \u2019 s not scalding .\nIf the water is too hot , it can irritate the cells of the esophagus .\nStudies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees

consuming warm or hot water was found to relive pain and intestinal spasms during a colonoscopy in patients with irritable bowel syndrome .\nEnhances Digestive Strength : In the journal Animals , warm water was found to increase the amount of beneficial bacteria in the intestines of rabbits .\nResearchers gave one group of rabbits cold water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months .\nThey found that the rabbits that drank warm water digested and assimilated their food better and had significantly more good bacteria in their intestines than the cold-water group .\nThis study supports the theory that warm water not only balances vata but enhances digestive strength and a more diverse microbiome .\nIn an older study , warm water helped the lower esophageal sphincter open more quickly allowing food to be more easily swallowed , Cold water tightened the lower esophageal sphincter and made it more difficult to swallow food .\nBetter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research to back up this Ayurvedic claim , in another study , warm water given after a surgery had a favorable effect on intestinal movements and a significant reduction in flatulence .\nRelives Sinus Congestion : In a 1978 study in which hot water was

Published studies show that no other food comes close to extra virgin olive oil for the prevention and treatment of chronic disease.\n\u201d Her studies suggest that the benefits of olive oil go far beyond heart health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two tablespoons a day .\nAt those level , extra virgin olive oil has been linked to : Watch my podcast with Dr. Flynn and dive deeper into the benefits of olive oil .\nIn a meta-analysis of seven studies from 1998 to 2015 , Flynn reports that consuming two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil a day , with a total phenol content of at least 161 mg/kg , could

point tests have been done on low-quality , likely adulterated olive oils purchased off a supermarket shelf .\nStudies on verified high-quality extra virgin olive oil have demonstrated low acidity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher resistance to oxidation , and longer shelf life compared to inferior oils on the market .\nThe stable properties of high-quality EVOO are primarily due to its polyphenols .\nRefining the oil or taking lower-quality oil from later stages of pressing significantly reduces polyphenol content .\nIn one study , certain store-bought olive oils had as much as five times the polyphenol content as others.7 In a 2015 study on cooking with extra virgin olive oil , researchers found that frying with olive oil and water preserved the antioxidant content of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @

melatonin production , and getting enough vitamin D3 .\nThere \u2019 s growing scientific evidence connecting how much daily sun exposure we get to how well we sleep .\nFor a whole suite of reasons\u2014from melatonin production to infrared exposure\u2014the sun could be your best medicine for sleep .\nLet \u2019 s dig in !\nHere , five ways the sun can help you sleep : According to Russel Reiter , PhD , one of the world \u2019 s most revered melatonin researchers , melatonin should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hormone\u2014which you may have heard it called before .\nMelatonin is a three-billion-year-old molecule that once activated biological changes in primitive organisms .\nThose changes allowed those organisms to adapt and evolve in harmony with the predictable cycles of day , night , summer , and winter , also known as circadian rhythms .\nFor this same reason , melatonin remains fundamental to the healthy functioning of all life , including ours .\nResearch shows that in humans , darkness stimulates neurons in the hypothalamus that signal the pineal gland to secrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and detoxification .\nInterestingly enough , your body makes melatonin during the day to release at night .\nA handful of studies have found that direct exposure to morning sunlight specifically increases the production of nighttime melatonin and supports better sleep .\nIn a study of 61 elderly folks , researchers found that exposure to direct sunlight between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. for five consecutive days increased sleep quality .\nIn a 2001 study , morning light exposure caused evening melatonin production to start earlier ( sometimes up to almost three hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more alignment with circadian rhythms .\nFinally , in a review of 45 studies that evaluated the impacts of light exposure , researchers found that morning light supported better sleep .\nSee also 10 Ways to Increase Melatonin Naturally for Better Sleep Daytime melatonin production , which is different from nighttime melatonin produced by the pineal gland , helps mitigate damaging oxidation that is a byproduct of cellular energy production .\nIt turns out that the sun \u2019 s daytime red and infrared light stimulates a massive production of melatonin inside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whopping 90 percent of the body \u2019 s melatonin is produced this way and used to reduce oxidative stress .\nAccumulation of free radicals ( that damaging oxidation ) is linked to accelerated aging , fatigue , poor sleep , and a host of other health concerns .\nIn a study that measured free radical damage and cognitive decline from sleep deprivation , researchers found that near infrared light exposure increased cellular melatonin .\nThey linked cellular melatonin to the repair of oxidative damage from sleep deprivation and the reversal of cognitive decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being Outside at Sunrise 3 .\nHow Much Sun You Get Each Day Affects Sleep Quality Serotonin , a neurotransmitter that supports stable moods , is also a precursor to melatonin .\nScientists have known for decades that the more sun exposure you get , the more serotonin you produce , and , in turn , the more melatonin your body produces .\nMore melatonin generally means better sleep .\nSachin Panda , PhD , the author ofThe Circadian Code and a leading expert in the field of circadian research , has compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on different amounts of daily sun exposure .\nHe measured sleep quality in study participants after they spent a week outside camping , as well as in participants who worked under shade , participants who worked indoors with lots of natural light , and participants who worked indoors under artificial light .\nWorking indoors under artificial light resulted in poor sleep .\nWorking outside under shade or indoors with lots of natural light resulted in decent sleep .\nWhile camping and being exposed to full sun all day , resulted in deep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Americans spend 90 percent of their time under artificial light .\nEven in the winter , it \u2019 s important to get outside as much as possible to make up for a lack of natural light and sun exposure .\nIn a study on children , sun exposure and sleep , researchers evaluated more than 14,000 students from age 7 to 18 years old for sleep duration , sleep onset time , physical activity , time in the sun , and consumption of tea and coffee .\nSleep duration improved significantly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sun exposure and exertion were correlated with earlier bedtimes .\nIn a recent study at the University of Colorado in Boulder , researchers found that reduced exposure to daytime sunlight and increased exposure to electrical lighting at night led to circadian disruption and altered sleep timing .\nThey performed two studies in which participants didn \u2019 t use any electrical devices or artificial lighting for a period of time .\nThe first study showed a 100 percent circadian realignment after camping for one week , and the second study , which asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , showed a 69 percent realignment with normal circadian rhythms .\nSee also Podcast Episode 121 : Decoding Your Circadian Rhythms According to one report , 70 percent of the photons , or light energy from the sun , are near infrared rays .\nThe majority of the sun \u2019 s red and infrared light intensity is after sunrise and before sunset .\nCampfires are also a powerful source of red and near infrared light .\nNear infrared light is next to red light in the visible light spectrum and while invisible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been shown to support healthy sleep cycles , beyond the benefits described above related to melatonin production .\nIn a study with female athletes , the use of red-light therapy before bed improved their quality of sleep .\nResearchers concluded that red light offered a nonpharmacologic and noninvasive therapy to prevent sleep disorders after training .\nOther studies have found that cellular energy production sparked by infrared and red light activates certain genes that may decrease symptoms of headache , cognitive impairment , sleep disturbance , anxiety , and depression .\nInfrared light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) .\nATP is cellular energy .\nDuring sleep , certain areas of the brain get a boost in ATP , which supports the Ayurvedic premise that we need energy to calm the nervous system down to sleep .\nWithout adequate energy , the nervous system would stay wired and tired with little sleep .\nAmple energy , in the form of ATP , is needed for healthy regulation of the body \u2019 s sleep cycles .\nATP energy has the ability to both excite and sedate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sleep balance .\nREM sleep , for example , requires more activating ATP , while deep sleep requires more sedative energy .\nWithout adequate exposure to the sun and it \u2019 s infrared rays , ATP production can become compromised .\nThe UVB radiation responsible for making pre-vitamin D on the skin is blocked by the atmosphere in the morning and afternoon hours .\nBut UVB rays can penetrate the atmosphere when the sun is bright at midday during the summer months in the northern and southern hemispheres .\nDuring winter months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low in the sky north of Atlanta for UVB rays to penetrate the atmosphere , which makes it a challenge to get adequate vitamin D from the sun .\nIn a 2021 review , researchers estimated that more than 1 billion people around the world are vitamin D deficient .\nAccording to a World Health Organization report , we shouldn \u2019 t be so afraid of sun exposure .\nExcessive UV radiation exposure accounts for only 0.1 percent of the total global burden of disease .\nSo , for the sake of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get some sun exposure .\nDuring the summer months it is quite easy to get enough vitamin D with minimal sun exposure .\nTo maintain healthy vitamin D levels , most adults need 3,000-5,000 IUs a day .\nIn a review of nine studies on vitamin D and sleep , researchers found that people with vitamin D deficiencies had a significantly higher risk for sleep disorders .\nThey also linked vitamin D deficiencies to poor sleep quality , short sleep duration , and lack of sleepiness .\nVitamin D receptors and enzymes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain involved in sleep regulation .\nVitamin D is also involved in the pathways of production of melatonin .\nVitamin D deficiencies are also associated with restless leg syndrome , sleep apnea , and chronic pain , which can all disturb sleep .\nI hope this research helps y \u2019 all to get
