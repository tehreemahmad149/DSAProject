means\u2026sorta .\nWe \u2019 re here to fill you in on what you need to know about metabolic health : what it is , why it \u2019 s important , how to improve it , and why you would want to .\nThe definition of metabolic health includes the following items : ideal levels of blood glucose , triglycerides , blood pressure , high-density @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumference , without the use of any medications .\nAll of the risk factors mentioned are directly associated with an individual \u2019 s risk for diabetes , stroke , and heart disease .\nAt the core of metabolic health is metabolism .\nLet \u2019 s start with some basics : metabolism , which is the sum of the chemical reactions performed by the body \u2019 s cells that transform food into energy .\nCertain proteins regulate these chemical reactions , thousands of which occur simultaneously .\nThe main precursor for energy is glucose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s necessary to keep a close eye on glucose levels if metabolism is going to work effectively .\nMetabolic health is the phrase used to describe how well metabolism is working , that is how efficiently your body switches from using glucose or fat for energy .\nIf you make wise food choices that allow your glucose levels to stay steady and within a healthy range , then you have taken a good step toward achieving optimal metabolic health .\nPoor metabolic health has been associated with a number of serious diseases and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not associate with metabolic health .\nIn addition to the cardiovascular and diabetes risks already mentioned , individuals whose metabolic health is compromised can experience obesity , non-alcoholic fatty liver disease , Alzheimer \u2019 s disease , and chronic kidney disease .\nAt a different level , poor metabolic health may appear as fatigue , anxiety , depression , brain fog , erectile dysfunction , acne , chronic pain , increased appetite , hair loss , poor exercise endurance , a greater risk for chronic disease , and more .\nIn fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of most chronic diseases .\nOn the other hand , if you take steps to improve your metabolic health , you can hope to enjoy better energy , memory , exercise endurance , fat burning , skin , fertility , immune function , and sexual health , as well as a lower risk of chronic diseases .\nRead about what everyone should know about blood sugar What s the role of glucose in metabolic health ?\nGlucose plays a huge role .\nThis simple sugar is the result of the breakdown of carbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bloodstream , it messages the pancreas to release insulin , which then tells cells to absorb glucose .\nThe mitochondria ( energy organelles in cells ) use glucose to make energy , while extra glucose is stored in muscle or the liver or it is converted to triglycerides and saved up in fat cells .\nIf your body gets too much glucose over time , it can lead to many health issues , such as high insulin , which can eventually become insulin resistance and interfere with the breakdown of stored fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also associated with inflammation , oxidative stress ( free radical damage to your cells ) , and glycation ( glucose sticks to proteins such as collagen and can cause high blood pressure ) .\nBasically , having too much glucose and not controlling your glucose well is a recipe for the development of serious and common chronic diseases .\nDiabetes , heart disease , dementia , infertility , obesity , stroke , and many more are metabolic health-related diseases .\nHere \u2019 s another term that \u2019 s important to know : metabolic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to respond or adapt to conditional changes in metabolic demand.\n\u201d People who are metabolically flexible have a body that can quickly adapt to burn the food they eat .\nIf they eat fat , the body burns fat ; if they eat carbs , the body burns carbs .\nWhen they fast , the body continues to burn fat for energy .\nHowever , if you are metabolically inflexible , your body can \u2019 t make those switches easily .\nIn the short term , the consequences can include energy crashes midday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overweight , and anxiety .\nIn the longer term , the result is high blood glucose levels and then insulin resistance , which then can lead to higher risks of high blood pressure , high cholesterol , obesity , and type 2 diabetes .\nMetabolic inflexibility also causes the mitochondria to produce more free radicals , which in turn can result in other serious illnesses such as cardiovascular disease .\nOne effective way to improve metabolic flexibility is following intermittent fasting .\nThis involves fasting for a set number of hours per day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific time span as well .\nA 16/8 program ( 16-hours fasting , 8-hour window for eating ) is among the most common .\nEven starting with a 12/12 program can make changes in how your body uses its available energy stores .\nFollowing a 14/10 or 18/6 program or fasting a full day several times a week are a few other options .\nIntermittent fasting can help improve insulin resistance , reduce cholesterol and oxidative stress , fight inflammation , and maintain lean muscle .\nHow can you improve metabolic health ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ making lifestyle changes and watching your glucose levels .\nFor example : \u2022 Watch your sugar intake .\nAmericans consume nearly more sugar daily than they did 100 years ago .\nSugar is in many processed foods , so read labels carefully before buying or cut back on the processed foods you consume .\n\u2022 Increase your fiber intake .\nFiber will leave you feeling full longer and is used to calculate net carbs in your diet .\nFor example , if a food has 6 grams of sugar and 5 grams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of carbs .\n\u2022 Focus on whole foods .\nFresh or frozen fruits and vegetables , whole grains , nuts , seeds , organic/pasture-fed/free-range meat and eggs , and healthy fats such as olive and avocado oils are best .\nAvoid processed foods .\n\u2022 Move .\nDaily exercise supports metabolic health .\nA mixture of aerobic and strength training provides the most benefit .\nshows that exercise improves glycemic control and insulin sensitivity .\n\u2022 Sleep .\nInsufficient sleep interferes with processing energy .\nGet at least 7 to 8 hours nightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insufficient sleep can have an impact on insulin resistance .\n\u2022 Avoid environmental and synthetic toxins .\nAlthough it \u2019 s impossible to completely stay away from these poisons , which impair the mitochondria and impact metabolism , you can reduce exposure by avoiding food additives , using all-natural health care and household cleaning products , not dry cleaning your clothes , using glass or stainless steel food containers instead of plastic , never using plastic in your microwave , only using stainless steel or ceramic water bottles ( no plastic ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Change eating times .\nSnacking throughout the day and eating late at night can boost insulin and thus interfere with fat burning for energy and bedtime snacks interfere with sleep .\n\u2022 Manage stress .\nhas a negative impact on the function of the mitochondria and their ability to produce energy .\nChronic stress also allows excess glucose to accumulate in the body .\nAdopt ways to manage your stress on a daily basis , such as meditation , yoga , deep breathing , listening to soothing music , tai chi , visualization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 Monitor your blood glucose .\nThis task isn \u2019 t just for people with diabetes .\nFor optimal metabolic health , everyone should monitor their blood sugar levels to see how it responds to your lifestyle and diet .\nThe best way to accomplish this is by using a continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) .\nBy using a CGM , you can track changes in your glucose levels , make dietary and lifestyle changes based on the readings from the CGM , see how your body responds to what you eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sleep , and thus take better control of your metabolic health

claims like `` low fat , '' `` high fiber , '' or `` good source of protein . ''\nInstead , we are going to explore the ambiguous , mysterious , and often confusing terms used to describe the ( often ) fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you are shopping for meat , dairy products , fish , and poultry , labels can reveal the environment in which the animals were raised or produced and what they were fed .\nSince the food and activity of food animals can have an impact on their nutritional content and density , these factors in turn can have an impact on the people who eat these foods .\nThat is , you are not only what you eat , but you are what the animals eat as well !\nHere are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods .\nFarmed : This term is used to describe fish that are commercially bred and raised in an enclosed pen , tank , or other space .\nAlso known as aquaculture , farmed fish may be less nutritious ( i.e.\n, contain less omega-3 fatty acids ) than wild-caught fish because of their diet .\nFarmed fish are often fed corn , soy , and other oils that contain little to no omega-3s .\nIntake of omega-3s has been shown to help support brain and cardiovascular health .\nHowever , as noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both farmed and wild-caught fish , fatty acid levels in farmed fish can vary widely and even exceed that found in wild fish , depending on what the aquaculturists feed their fish .\nAlso , since farmed fish are raised in unnatural conditions , there is the risk of disease and parasites that can spread outside of the farmed environment to wild fish .\nRead about the 5 best reasons to never ever eat factory-farmed fish Wild/wild-caught : This refers to fish who are caught in their natural environment , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colorado State University notes that wild-caught fish , which eat a natural diet , tend to have lower levels of saturated fat than farm-raised fish , which means a higher protein content .\nWild-caught fish also tend to have less disease and lower levels of contaminants .\nFree-range : According to the US Department of Agriculture , \u201c free-range \u201d can be used to describe any poultry ( including eggs ) and meat products .\nThe animals involved must have continuous , free access to an outdoor environment for more than 51 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle .\nAnother term used to describe this method is pasture-raised .\nBecause these animals can get more exercise than those in feedlots or cages , they tend to be leaner and thus provide more protein and less saturated fat .\nLess saturated fat in the diet can mean lower levels of bad ( low-density lipoprotein , LDL ) cholesterol , which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease .\nIn a study that compared free-range with conventionally raised chickens , for example , the authors found that free-range chickens had greater protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their counterparts .\nOrganic : When referring to meat , poultry , and dairy foods , the USDA notes that organic \u201c means that the animals from which it originated were raised in living conditions that

"title": "What\u2019s New about Cholesterol?", "content": "We are often reminded that high blood pressure ( hypertension ) is a silent disease , but there \u2019 s another disease that has no symptoms as well : high cholesterol .\nThis isn \u2019 t news , but a few things about cholesterol may be new , including a better way to measure cholesterol and some natural ways to help prevent the disease typically associated with high cholesterol : heart disease .\nFirst , however , let \u2019 s look at some basics .\nMost doctors will tell you that high total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart disease .\nTo that end , individuals are urged to check their cholesterol levels regularly using the complete cholesterol test\u2014a lipid panel or lipid profile\u2014which measures cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the blood .\nThe American Heart Association , for example , recommends that people age 20 and older be checked every four to six years if their risk is low .\nThose with total cholesterol levels greater than 200 mg/dL should be checked more frequently .\nThe standard complete cholesterol test measures four types of fats in the bloodstream : \u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cholesterol in your blood .\nHealthy level : 125-200 mg/dL \u2022 Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) , also known as \u201c bad \u201d cholesterol , is a measure of the amount of cholesterol found in LDL particles ( LDL-P ) .\nElevated levels of LDL-C cause the accumulation of plaques in your arteries or atherosclerosis .\nIf the plaques rupture , they can result in a heart attack or stroke .\nHealthy LDL-C : < 100 mg/dL \u2022 High-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) , aka \u201c good \u201d cholesterol , helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus helps with better blood flow .\nHealthy HDL-C : > 45 mg/dL \u2022 Triglycerides .\nThis fat is formed when the body transforms calories it doesn \u2019 t use .\nThe triglycerides are stored in fat cells , and high levels of triglycerides are associated with overweight/obesity , diabetes , and elevated blood glucose levels .\nHealthy level : < 150 mg/dL A problem with standard cholesterol testing is that it doesn \u2019 t go far enough , according to some experts , including Jonny Bowden , Ph.D. , CNS , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He recommends the NMR ( nuclear magnetic resonance ) particle test .\nWhat is the NMR particle test ?\nThe NMR particle test is an advanced lipid profile that provides information gathered in the standard test but then goes much deeper .\nThe additional information gives you and your doctor a clearer idea of your cardiovascular disease risk and insulin resistance risk .\nHere is a breakdown of those additional features .\n\u2022 Low-density lipoprotein particles , or LDL-P .\nThese elements hang out in the blood for a long time , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and form plaque .\nThe more LDL-P in the bloodstream , the greater the risk they will attach themselves to the arteries .\n\u2022 Small LDL particle number ( small LDL-P ) .\nThe greater number of small LDL-P , the greater the risk of cardiovascular disease .\nThe combination of LDL-P and small LDL-P levels gives individuals a much clearer picture of their cardiovascular disease risk .\n\u2022 HDL particles ( HDL-P ) .\nHDL transports bad cholesterol to the liver , therefore , the higher the HDL-P number , the greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit of the NMR test is that it provides information about a person \u2019 s risk of developing insulin resistance , which Dr. Bowden notes is a much better predictor of cardiovascular disease than cholesterol alone .\nThat \u2019 s because the test measures LDL particle size .\nSmall , dense LDL particles are closely associated with insulin resistance because the particles contribute to the formation of plaque and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes .\nThis leads to yet another factor the NMR test measures : the LP-IR , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the culmination of six lipoprotein particle numbers and sizes and their association with insulin resistance .\nThree of the more powerful natural supplements to help ward off high cholesterol in particular and cardiovascular disease in general , are aged garlic extract , phytosterols , and omega-3 fatty acids .\nUse of such supplements , plus regular exercise , a healthy weight , stress management , and a nutritious diet ( e.g.\n, Mediterranean , DASH , vegetarian , and more ) can be just what the doctor ordered !\nAged garlic extract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been shown to play a significant role in managing high cholesterol .\nCholesterol is a fat with both beneficial and harmful qualities .\nIn the former category , cholesterol is necessary for producing vitamin D , hormones , bile , and cell membranes .\nIn the latter category , unhealthy levels of harmful types of cholesterol can ultimately lead to cardiovascular disease .\nAged garlic extract can help .\nIn a review of 39 human studies , for example , the authors noted that AGE reduced total cholesterol levels by 17 mg/dL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with total cholesterol levels greater than 200 mg/dL .\nThis is significant because an 8 percent reduction in total cholesterol levels is associated with a 38 percent reduction in the risk of experiencing coronary events at age 50 .\nIn earlier research on both animals and humans , experts identified some of the reasons aged garlic extract has cholesterol-lowering effects .\nOne factor is the ability of the extract to inhibit the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver by water-soluble sulfur compounds , including S-allylcysteine .\nMuch research also has shown that aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accumulation of plaque ( cholesterol and other fats ) in the arteries , which in turn can reduce the advancement of atherosclerosis , a condition in which blood flow is compromised because of damage to the arteries .\nPhytosterols .\nPhytosterols are fats found in plants and are structurally similar to cholesterol .\nHowever , they don \u2019 t act like cholesterol and instead aid in stopping cholesterol absorption from the diet by fighting for space in the intestinal tract .\nThis action , in turn reduces levels of bad cholesterol and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find phytosterols in all plant foods , they are most prominent in unrefined plant oils , such as olive , nut , and vegetables .\nGood dietary sources include nuts , seeds , whole grains , and legumes .\nPhytosterols are also available in supplement form .\nOmega-3 fatty acids .\nThese fatty acids\u2014eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid- are primarily found in oily fish such as tuna , salmon , herring , and mackerel , as well as some seeds and nuts .\nRegarding cardiovascular health , the use of omega-3s has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and provide a slight improvement in HDL cholesterol .\nOmega-3s are often combined with aged garlic extract to provide better protection against cardiovascular disease .\nThe standard cholesterol test doesn \u2019 t provide enough reliable information to help predict your risk for cardiovascular disease .\nA combination of results of the NMR particle test , cholesterol-managing supplements , and a healthy lifestyle ( diet , exercise , stress management ) is a promising recipe for reducing cardiovascular disease risk .\n[ Editor 's Note :
