Unionists , led by tuba-honking dunderhead Blair McDougall ( the man who turned a 30-point No lead into a 10-point one , and who lost Labour 5000 votes when he stood in East Renfrewshire in 2017 on the basis of being the guy who saved the UK \u2013 trailing in an embarrassing 3rd in a seat where Jim Murphy had won over 50 % of the vote \u2013 and who is probably more responsible than any other individual for the utter destruction of Scottish Labour as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient \u201c Better Together \u201d scare story about pensions in an independent Scotland .\nSo as a small public service , we republish below this article from November 2016 on the subject , which remains an accurate and up-to-date summation of the reality .\nNOTE : Since the indyref it has been established that UK \u201c pensions \u201d are in fact legally no such thing \u2013 they \u2019 re a benefit , paid for by taxation .\nThe notion that they \u2019 re actually a pension in any normal sense of that word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK Government .\nHowever , that fact alters absolutely none of the below .\nWhat They Expect You To Believe 25 November 2016 For some reason the Unionist community has this week been turning the bullhorn up to maximum on the subject of pensions .\nMost likely provoked by the publication of Dr Craig Dalzell \u2019 s fascinating \u201c Beyond GERS \u201d , the usual suspects have returned to the scaremongering tactics deployed during the indyref , attempting to terrorise the elderly with blood-curdling threats of destitution once again .\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation regarding pensions is one of the few around independence about which there is known certainty .\nThe UK government already pays the state pension to millions of people outside the UK , under rules which would apply in exactly the same way if Scotland became a \u201c foreign \u201d country .\nBut just for fun , let \u2019 s look at exactly what the situation would be in the monumentally implausible event that Blair McDougall was telling the truth for once .\nThe claim being made , remember , is that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pensions of all existing pensioners in Scotland \u2013 that is , at the moment of independence the rUK would instantly abandon all responsibility for people who have paid their National Insurance contributions to the UK Treasury for their whole lives , and expect the Scottish Government to pick up the tab .\nSo what would that mean in practice ?\n( 1 ) There are currently approximately 900,000 pensioners in Scotland .\nThey are all UK citizens , and would remain so after independence .\nThe UK government \u2019 s own \u201c Scotland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 2014 said : The legal difficulties in suddenly depriving a million-plus UK citizens of their fully-paid-up pensions \u2013 which would almost certainly ultimately involve having to strip them of their citizenship against their will , even though most of them would very likely have voted No and all of them would still be living exactly where they had been before \u2013 would be unimaginably immense , and in reality impossible .\n( 2 ) To have even a chance of successfully doing so , the rUK government would also have to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pensioners living elsewhere in the world .\nThere are currently around 5.5 million UK expats entitled to vote , and while few of them currently exercise that right , any government proposing to take their pensions away might find a sudden spectacular spike in democratic engagement that was not to its advantage .\nIt would be political suicide .\n( 3 ) Otherwise , a situation would arise where , say , a 75-year-old woman born and raised in Kent for her entire life who wanted to emigrate and spend her twilight years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retire to Spain or France or Canada or Australia or anywhere else on the face of the planet without losing her pension , but uniquely be forbidden from moving to Scotland on pain of being made penniless overnight .\n( 4 ) This would be extra-stupid because governments LOVE it when pensioners retire abroad .\nThey might have to keep paying their pensions , but once someone reaches pension age they \u2019 re usually a net fiscal drain on society in countless other ways , especially health , and the cold harsh truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of them .\nAs such , anything that discourages them from leaving the country is economically idiotic .\n( 5 ) Indeed , it would be likely to create a huge surge in what would effectively if not technically be immigration , as thousands of expensive-to-service UK citizens were forced to flood back into the country because their source of income had been taken away and they could no longer afford to live elsewhere .\nIt \u2019 s an idea so farcical it pains us to even have to be spelling it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the UK government has made absolutely clear that it has no intentions of trying to do any of this , because it \u2019 s not completely out of its mind .\nA couple of weeks before the indyref , an article on the BBC website noted : Panicking Unionists have tried to focus on the words immediately after the ones we \u2019 ve highlighted in that image , claiming that \u201c it might be dished out via the Scottish Pensions System rather than the UK one \u201d , means the Scottish Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than just handling the admin of delivering them .\nBut that \u2019 s a self-evidently ludicrous interpretation \u2013 the UK government plainly has no power to \u201c agree \u201d to that on the Scottish Government \u2019 s behalf .\nIt can only assert that pensions will be honoured if IT is going to honour them , which means paying for them .\nAnd the White Paper ( p144 ) confirms that the Scottish Government will only take over the administration of existing UK state pension entitlements : The document clearly differentiates between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Scottish State Pension \u201d as separate entities , the latter of which people will only accrue entitlements to after independence .\nBut the White Paper \u2013 a policy proposal , not a binding legal document \u2013 is really neither here nor there .\nThe finer technical points of split-entitlement pensions will be something for the two governments to thrash out in negotiations , but the arithmetic is straightforward and the international mechanisms for doing so are already in place .\nThe idea , however , that the UK government could \u2013 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its responsibility to hundreds of thousands of UK citizens to whom it \u2019 s already non-negotiably obligated to pay a pension for life is the sort of madness that no sane person would give a moment \u2019 s credence to .\nThere \u2019 s a good reason that no UK minister has ever actually said any such thing \u2013 they \u2019 d be torn limb from limb .\nThat Unionists have now taken it from something that was previously only whispered quietly off the record to frightened old folk on their doorsteps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrified desperation that has seized them ever since the Brexit vote .\nIf you thought you \u2019 d seen Project Fear last time , readers , batten down the hatches .", "author": "Rev.

children be used as props to make men with sexual fetishes feel better ?\nIt doesn \u2019 t seem like a difficult question , does it ?\nThe above quote is part of the heartfelt plea of a mother of a disabled daughter .\nWe know that women and girls are vulnerable to male sexual violence , we know that men commit 98 % of sex offences and we know that disabled children are three to four times more likely to experience abuse .\nWe just don \u2019 t seem to care .\nThe United Nations Population Fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the African Child Policy Forum of violence against children with disabilities , nearly every young person interviewed had been sexually abused at least once \u2013 and most more than once \u201d .\nOnce they reach adulthood , the statistics according to research by DAME Magazine are terrifying : The magazine \u2019 s Victoria Brownworth argued that ( in the US ) \u201c 77 % of rapes and sexual assaults were not reported to police .\nThe enormity of that number suggests that within the context of disability , where so many victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or where the person they would report to is the same person perpetuating the assaults ( and on whom they depend for their most basic care ) , the number may be perilously close to 100 percent.\n\u201d Alongside the significant risk of sexual violence , we know that girls and women experience an indignity and a trauma when they are forced to allow a male to undress them and touch their vulva , breasts or anus when they do not consent and do not want this touch .\nSex is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , it can feel like society has sentenced you to suffer at the hands of men .\nThe figures and the possibilities of your future are stark .\nPeople look away at the obvious risks , they deny that you too need dignity , they claim \u201c not all men \u201d .\nAnd while it isn \u2019 t all men , it \u2019 s also not just seven bad ones \u2013 they wouldn \u2019 t have the time to abuse all of these children and women .\nAlthough it \u2019 s difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously it hasn \u2019 t been seen as important enough to collect , the data which is emerging is showing a similar pattern across nations .\nVery vulnerable children and adults , particularly those who struggle to communicate , are seen as targets by predators .\nThese predatory males will use careers where they can have access to these vulnerable children in order to abuse .\nFor example , evidence was given to the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry that a potential sex offender was being employed and moved around children \u2019 s homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFrequently men will move into positions where they can have access to their targets .\nIn May 2021 Dorrion Etienne was imprisoned for targeting and sexually abusing two learning-disabled girls at their school .\nIn August 2021 a former deputy headmaster and a head of care at a special needs school in Lincolnshire who raped and assaulted girl pupils over the course of 12 years were jailed for more than 23 years .\nIn November 2021 Robin James Elms was convicted and sentenced after he \u201c targeted a child with special needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes where he worked as a freelance nanny and babysitter .\nHe picked on children he thought were too young to speak up or who had learning difficulties and autism , grooming entire families in order to commit his abuse \u201d .\nAlso in November 2021 it was reported that George Holden , \u201c a former Derbyshire teacher and professional clown expects to die behind bars after being jailed for abusing young children .\nThe court heard his previous convictions included sexually abusing blind and disabled children while working as a teacher at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2021 Brian Rudgley , an 83-year-old retired head teacher with years of experience working with children with special educational needs was imprisoned for sexually abusing a learning-disabled girl .\nWe have seen this pattern in institutions like sports clubs , charities and the Church to name just a few .\nPredators will move to where they can get to their prey .\nYet still , politicians are behaving like such behaviour is beyond the realms of possibility .\nI am sick of them playing dumb and putting the wellbeing of the disabled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again being proposed by politicians that male feelings and male egos need to be prioritised and protected by law above the needs of the vulnerable , and those who too frequently experience sexual abuse at the hands of males .\nWe are not even allowed to name the pattern \u2013 male sexual violence \u2013 in case it offends men .\nLanguage had been changed to obscure reality .\nParent P , who wished to remain anonymous , pointed out that \u201c lots of people won \u2019 t think twice about a form only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also think these terms are interchangeable .\nThe erosion and hijacking of our rights is so insidious \u201d .\nWhen it \u2019 s a form deciding what adult will be touching your child \u2019 s genitals , the difference between sex and gender identity is put in much sharper relief .\nSame-sex care is the most basic of safeguards and provides dignity , we should be able to choose it for ourselves and our relatives .\nHowever , it commonly appears that NHS policies have been written according to Stonewall \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Equality Act 2010 .\nNHS Lanarkshire \u2019 s \u201c Supporting Trans Staff in the Workplace \u201d dictates that employees : Translated , a cross-dressing man who gets aroused in women \u2019 s clothes is to be treated as a woman , and this includes allowing him access to disabled girls \u2019 naked bodies .\nThe Equality Act 2010 makes it acceptable to discriminate on the basis of sex if there is a legitimate aim \u2013 this is known as a General Occupational Qualification ( GOQ ) .\nIf women and girls are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Stonewall poisoned the well , that a GOQ would automatically apply .\nNHS Lanarkshire has pre-empted challenge on this point and commanded staff that male feelings come above the law in this regard .\nIt declares that : This secret-keeping about ( mostly ) males \u2019 true sex , identity , and past means the scenario could arise that parents place their severely disabled non-verbal teenage daughter in a short respite care , thinking she will receive intimate care and be attended to at night by a woman , when in reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has put on women \u2019 s clothes and is repeatedly washing the girl \u2019 s vulva .\nIs that sexual abuse ?\nThe young girl will feel violated , will feel abused , will be traumatised .\nThe parents will feel lied to , and wonder if they can ever trust the care of their daughter to Lanarkshire NHS again .\nAllan Petrie , the chairperson of Glenlaw Parent/Carer Support Group , has written to Shona Robison , the Cabinet Secretary for Social Justice , Housing and Local Government to raise parental concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , noting that \u201c trans \u201d is now an umbrella term encompassing all manner of groups including drag queens , crossdressers and \u201c midlings \u201d , whatever those might be .\nIt \u2019 s also argued within the LGB/T/Q/+ community that a range of extreme ( and even illegal ) sexual practices grouped under the term \u201c kink \u201d belong under the trans/LGBTQ+ \u201c umbrella \u201d .\nThe Q in LGBTQ+ ( the official preferred term of people like the Scottish Greens ) already stands for Queer , a term which organisations like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any meaningful way but appears to implicitly embrace \u201c kink \u201d , as being outwith \u201c perceived norms \u201d and \u201c specific labels \u201d .\nOr put another way , it means whatever you want it to mean .\nChristina Richards \u2013 a transwoman who is Lead Psychologist and Head of Psychology at the UK \u2019 s foremost \u201c gender identity clinic \u201d , the Tavistock in London \u2013 has called for many extreme and violent sexual practices to be normalised and no longer classified as paraphilias \u2013 conditions \u201c characterized by abnormal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous activities \u201d .\nMr Petrie explained that to the minister : Research by NSPCC Learning together with Coventry University and the Ann Craft Trust presented the universalism of these parental anxieties around the care of their disabled children .\nOne parent respondent described how The research highlighted how \u201c parents whose children had complex needs raised particular concerns regarding how incredibly difficult it was to teach their children about issues such as safe touch in their intimate care , puberty and changes in their bodies and about sexual abuse .\nTheir greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to communicate if they felt unsafe .\nOne parent explained that her son used Makaton to communicate , yet there were no staff in his school that could use Makaton .\nAs a result the child had no means of communicating with anyone \u201d .\nThe sexual abuse of disabled children and young adults is so widespread that the NSPCC alongside the charity Triangle has developed a communication system for children to express abuse .\nTriangle highlighted that before their intervention , children who used symbol vocabulary to communicate could \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not say \u2018 leave me alone \u2019 .\n\u201d Due to the fact that disabled children did not have access to specific symbols which could communicate sexual abuse , safeguarding experts and investigators would sometimes have to hand draw images and thus accusations of coaching the child could be made .\nThis added to non-verbal children being perceived as weak witnesses and subsequently cases not being prosecuted .\nConsequently it increased the targeting of such children by perpetrators .\nTriangle has enabled disabled children and young people to get legal redress for crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children to tell someone what \u2019 s being done to them .\nAs part of developing the images , Triangle Yes , in our society we \u2019 ve had to develop a way for severely disabled children who may have mental ages of 6 to 8 to say \u201c willy \u201d , \u201c hard \u201d and \u201c squirt \u201d .\nOnce communication has been enabled the struggle to participate in the justice system doesn \u2019 t stop there .\nAs well as access to communication , physical access to the courts is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK courts are currently accessible to disabled people .\nThis , frankly , is a denial of fundamental rights and what exclusion really looks like .\nAlongside the obvious safeguarding issues and the need to maintain dignity for the disabled is the fact that a male carer would retraumatise disabled girls who have already been sexually abused by men .\nAnn West commented that \u201c our disabled daughter was seriously sexually assaulted .\nWe were assured she would always have women support staff especially as she needs assistance with all her personal care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassured , in fact I \u2019 m terrified for her future .\nThis is so wrong on every level \u2019 .\n\u201d It is generally understood that women and girls who have been sexually assaulted and or raped by men find the presence of and touch of men re-traumatising , and this is no different if the women or girl has a disability .\nIn fact it may be exaggerated because that man might be touching your vulva , breasts and other parts of your body .\nThe statistics on abuse are stark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are three to four times more likely to experience physical and sexual violence .\nWhy would a man want to do this ?\nIf he doesn \u2019 t care about the potential serious impact he will have on the disabled girl or woman , should he be in a caring position at all ?\nSince when has it been acceptable to use disabled children as props to arouse men ?\nTo most people it is astonishing that questioning a man touching your non-verbal disabled female child \u2019 s genitals could be a criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to become a hate crime.Why are politicians willing to re-traumatise potential abuse victims to fulfil men \u2019 s fantasies ?\nDr EM is

movement has put what would have been concealed and kept behind closed doors on centre stage .\nThis is why normal , decent men look aghast at other men \u2019 s behaviour while many women sigh with an \u2018 oh , this again \u2019 .\nThe woke bloke contempt for women is clear and abusive behaviours are on full display .\nReading through Lundy Bancroft \u2019 s pivotal work \u201c Why Does He Do That ?\nInside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men \u201d , the full cast of characters is present on Twitter , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions .\nBancroft \u2019 s insights come from working with \u2018 angry and controlling men for fifteen years as a counsellor , evaluator , and investigator , and [ having ] accumulated a wealth of knowledge from the two thousand or more cases with which he \u2019 s been involved \u2019 .\n[ 1 ] Bancroft \u2019 s work , sometimes criticised for being too inclusive and easily applied to any man , is corroborated by what women know personally from relationships with abusive men , the patterns we recognise and which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Refuge and charities attempting to end violence against women such as Nia .\nWe are currently watching the microcosm of male abuse go macro .\nBancroft convincingly argues that it is values which cause abuse not personality , or mental disorders , or a childhood history of abuse , or alcohol or drugs .\nThose factors only exacerbate an existing problem \u2013 the value system of the man \u2013 and can make him more dangerous .\n[ 2 ] He also noted that \u2018 Their value system is unhealthy , not their psychology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuser , they get what they want most of the time \u2019 .\n[ 3 ] The crossover between \u2018 trans rights activists \u2019 , incels and men \u2019 s rights activists has been frequently pointed out by feminists , but it is time to take a look at the supporting troupe .\nThe bullying blue ticks , the fresh-faced student misogynists , the older self-serving politicians .\nTwo things unite them all , and it is not a desire for social justice or a committed belief that clothes are magical and change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only explain so much in the face of evidence , women \u2019 s concerns and the behaviour they exhibit .\n[ 4 ] It is in fact misogynistic values and pornography use which drive the phenomenon .\nMen who bully and abuse women have dehumanised them and can not see them as equals .\nBancroft details how \u2018 most abusers verbally attack their partners in degrading , revolting ways .\nThey reach for the words that they know are most disturbing to women , such as bitch , whore , and cunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThese words assault her humanity , reducing her to\u2026 a non-living object , or a degraded sexual body part \u2019 .\n[ 5 ] Bancroft asserts that abusive men do this because \u2018 by depersonalizing his partner , the abuser protects himself from the natural human emotions of guilt and empathy , so that he can sleep at night with a clear conscience .\nHe distances himself so far from her humanity that her feelings no longer count , or simply cease to exist \u2019 .\n[ 6 ] This \u201c less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoted and reinforced by patriarchal culture .\n\u201c Objectification Theory \u201d ( Fredrickson & Roberts , 1997 ) provides a framework for understanding \u2018 the experience of being female in a sociocultural context that sexually objectifies the female body \u2019 .\n[ 7 ] We live in such a culture and pornography is the propaganda .\nIt dehumanises and objectifies women , who are reduced to orifices to be penetrated , bits and parts ( legs , breasts , bum , hair ) to titillate .\nThe trans-sex-role stereotype movement has reduced female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear when he chooses .\nPornography sends the message that no matter who she is or what she has achieved her purpose in life is to be fucked and please men .\nMarcia Weskot argued that objectification \u2018 is the socially sanctioned right of all males to sexualise all females , regardless of age or status \u2019 .\n[ 8 ] It is evidenced in the trans-sex-role-stereotype movement \u2019 s claim that the true innate female essence is a desire to be \u2018 surrendering holes \u2019 and that \u2018 according to transgender ideology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ males , to be sexually abused is to be \u2018 feminised \u2019 .\n[ 9 ] We are seeing the results of frequent pornography use in males denying that women have an inner world and arguing that what someone looks like , their clothes and hair , defines them .\nThe misogynistic slur \u2018 TERF \u2019 is used to brutalise women further .\nIn 2019 the District Judge John Woollard acknowledged \u2018 TERF \u2019 was a derogatory word aimed at , primarily , women while the All Party Parliamentary Group Report on Hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognised \u2018 TERF \u2019 as hate speech which contributed to threats of violence against women .\n[ 10 ] \u2018 Terf \u2019 is a clear example of male fury that women have views and opinions about their lives and resist male control .\nWomen having their own thoughts and attitudes clashes with the schema some men have developed that women exist to gratify men .\nThis mindset is the product of frequent pornography use and apparent in the antagonism and disdain men have for women , shown in the emerging abuse patterns .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ women can spot from abusive men .\nThese are the patterns that have women in a domestic violence setting \u2018 walking on egg-shells \u2019 , women wondering if abusers all get a handbook .\nThat one expression , \u2018 the look \u2019 , that no one else seems to notice but can turn your blood to ice from across a crowded room .\nThe abusive and controlling man will start faux-nice in an attempt to manipulate the woman and his audience .\nHe feels entitled to do this because he believes that women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as smarter .\nWe see this view of women as lesser online in the men who ignore the thousands of responses from women and only respond to other men .\nWe see it in the dismissal of the opinions and evidence given by qualified women and the elevation of male feelings as truth .\nThe woke blokes \u2019 online behaviour is also mirrored in the behaviour of domestic abusers in how \u2018 one of the prevalent features of life with an angry or controlling partner is that he frequently tells you what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to doubt or devalue your own perceptions and beliefs \u2019 .\n[ 11 ] The trans movement , particularly in this respect , is individual male abuse of women turned into a group movement .\nIf the woman does not \u2018 play nice \u2019 quickly [ 5 ] , ie does not agree with his assertions , the woman will receive insults and witness his escalating rage .\nThe blame will be turned on the woman , she will be held responsible for his outburst and the reactions of others .\nHe will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thinking or that he knows her intentions .\nThe abuser will focus on his feelings , rather than facts .\nBancroft details how \u2018 he draws you into focusing on the turbulent world of his feelings to keep your eyes turned away from the true cause of his abusiveness , which lies in how he thinks \u2019 .12 There will be an explosion when he doesn \u2019 t get his way , limited to verbal threats online but behind closed doors this is often when the violence occurs .\nThen , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 each attack on her , no matter how brutal his abuse or how serious her injuries \u2019 .\n[ 13 ] This is because \u2018 part of how the abuser escapes confronting himself is by convincing you that you are the cause of his behaviour , or that you at least share the blame \u2019 .\n[ 14 ] A red flag is that \u2018 abusers externalize responsibility for their actions \u2019 , indeed , \u2018 everything is someone else \u2019 s fault , and \u201c someone else \u201d is usually her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the sun will rise women , and anyone who has knowledge of his behaviour will hear a sob story and how he is a victim/hard done by .\n\u2018 Abusive men are sometimes masters of the hard-luck story \u2019 .\n[ 16 ] He will not only claim to be the victim of

@ @ @ @ @ next time he explodes but he will be unable to let go of his target .\nThe woke bloke , like the abuser behind closed doors , is seeking to control women and feels that it is his right to control others .\nThus , he expects to have the last word and believes he is [ 6 ] justified in punishing those who would challenge him .\nAs Bancroft outlines , \u2018 the abuser gives himself permission to take action on the basis of his beliefs \u2019 and \u2018 a large part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of punishments used to retaliate against you for resisting his control \u2019 .\n[ 17 ] This control is often \u2018 exercised through wearing the woman down with constant low-level complaints , rather than through yelling or barking orders .\nThe abuser may repeatedly make negative comments \u2019 .\n[ 18 ] It is through chronic mistreatment , which in an online setting takes the form of a pile-on or the frequent messaging that \u2018 terfs \u2019 /transphobes are scum etc , that the victim begins to doubt herself and her confidence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolate his victim through getting her to cut ties with friends and family , controlling who she speaks to , controlling when and why she leaves the home , and often moving her to a different location .\nOnline , this is what is happening with , for example , the periodic attempts by men to shutdown Mumsnet .\nControlling men hate that there is a space where women can talk to each other and offer support to each other .\nNothing poses a more direct threat to their control and manipulation than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisterly support can clear the fog of male abuse so that the woman recognise it for what it is .\nAnother tactic the controlling and abusive male will use in the online world is to brand the woman and make it clear that anyone who interacts with the woman will share in her branding .\nThis is how accusations of \u2018 transphobia \u2019 or \u2018 TERF \u2019 are designed to work .\nIt \u2019 s a message to other women that they will share in her social suffering if they stand too close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceived transgressions , it serves to isolate the woman until she begs forgiveness , promises to stop thinking for herself and can be controlled .\nWe commonly meet two of Bancroft \u2019 s abuser types in the online debate over whether women are fully human or a costume for male fetish : \u2018 Mr Always Right \u2019 and \u2018 Mr Sensitive \u2019 .\nBancroft delineates how \u2018 when Mr .\nRight decides to take control of a conversation , he [ 8 ] switches into his Voice of Truth , giving the definitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the proper outlook .\nAbuse counsellors call this tactic defining reality .\nOver time , his tone of authority can cause his partner to doubt her own judgment and come to see herself as not very bright \u2019 .\n[ 19 ] Writing about domestic abusers in 2002 Bancroft managed to predict almost every conversation with a woke bloke .\nWhen a woman continues to assert herself \u2018 he is likely to escalate to insulting her , calling her names , or mocking her with imitation .\nIf he \u2019 s still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down low enough , he may reach for bigger guns \u2019 , such as complaints to her employer , legal threats or threats of violence .\n[ 20 ] If his behaviour is questioned , \u2018 Mr .\nAlways Right attempts to sanitize his bullying by saying : \u201c I have strong opinions \u201d or \u201c I like debating ideas.\n\u201d This is like a bank robber saying \u201c I \u2019 m interested in financial issues.\n\u201d Mr .\nRight isn \u2019 t interested in debating ideas ; he wants to impose his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the online setting Mr Always Right is often combined with another one of Bancroft \u2019 s abuser types : \u2018 Mr Sensitive \u2019 .\nMr Sensitive \u2018 loves the language of feelings , openly sharing his insecurities , his fears , and his emotional injuries \u2019 .\n[ 22 ] He is , in other words , a crybully .\nMr Sensitive is distinguished from genuine male allies and good men by his idea that \u2018 nothing in the world is more important than my feelings .\nWomen should be grateful to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 .\n[ 23 ] He is further differentiated from the actual good men by the tell that he sets out for praise and attention rather than to help make a difference or to confront an injustice and thus dominates the conversation and speaks over women .\nHe will often take the label \u2018 feminist \u2019 or \u2018 male feminist \u2019 because he feels he is entitled to things women have .\nThe self-perception of himself as one of the good guys feeds his prerogative to abuse women who challenge or question him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 cover to conceal his abuse because \u2018 he \u2019 s not like one of those unenlightened men \u2019 , he is different from the cultural caricature of the violent , ignorant brute and so couldn \u2019 t possibly be bad .\nBancroft warned 19 years ago [ 9 ] that this male abuser \u2018 presents himself to women as an ally in the struggle against sex-role limitations \u2019 .\n[ 24 ] In this way , \u2018 Mr .\nSensitive wraps himself in one of the most persuasive covers a man can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chronically mistreated by him , you are likely to assume that something is wrong with you , and if you complain about him to other people \u2019 they presume something is wrong with you , not him .\n[ 25 ] The false face of \u2018 Mr Sensitive \u2019 is why some women are quick to disengage while others wish to \u2018 give him the benefit of the doubt \u2019 and argue \u2018 he didn \u2019 t mean that \u2019 .\nThis is present in those who self-promote that they are \u2018 champions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often the first to exclude women for wrongthink .\nWhile it does not necessarily follow that woke blokes are abusing women behind closed doors , the point of this essay is that they share the value-system of domestic abusers .\nThe worldview that enables the abusive male we encounter in a domestic violence setting has become more common as females are dehumanised and objectified by pornography .\nThis is one reason why the misogynistic transgender movement has managed to spread so quickly .\nDr EM is a disabled , feminist writer and historian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to threats to her safety , and tweets as @ PankhurstEM .\n1 L.

Cass Interim Report : Independent review of gender identity services for children and young people \u2013 Implications for Scotland As you will be aware , the Westminster Health Secretary has announced an urgent inquiry into gender hormone treatment for vulnerable children , stating that the system is \u201c failing children \u201d ( 1 ) .\nMr Javid was particularly alarmed at the pressures on staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transitioning and is planning an overhaul of how health service staff deal with under-18s who present with gender distress .\nWe welcome this intervention as the responsible course of action following a series of legal actions by whistleblowers ( 2 ) and a NICE report ( 3 ) highlighting serious concerns with the low quality of evidence for both GnRH agonists ( puberty blockers ) and cross-sex hormones .\nThe recently published interim report ( 4 ) by Dr Hilary Cass , who was commissioned by NHS England to investigate child gender services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children \u2019 s clinic not a safe or viable long-term option for children .\nThe politicising of a childhood condition and treatment based on ideology rather than facts and evidence has led to numerous children being harmed irreversibly by the medical profession .\nIt would be foolish to think this situation is confined to England .\nMany countries , including Scotland , follow the same treatment protocol for gender-distressed children , although after recent reviews some , including Sweden ( 5 ) , Finland ( 6 ) and France ( 7 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatments in preference for psychotherapy .\nThe Care Quality Commission deemed Tavistock , the London gender clinic for children , \u201c inadequate \u201d and critcised it for deficient record keeping ( 8 ) , but at least it held information on the ratio of male to female patients , the number and age of those prescribed puberty blockers , and noted the disproportionately high rates of patients with autistic traits .\nThe counterpart clinic Sandyford in Glasgow can give no such information ( 9 ) , in fact it is unable to even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a reversal in mainly male patients to a 75 % female one , for the simple reason that it permits children to choose , or omit , the sex recorded on their medical files .\n( 10 ) NHS Scotland also had to correct a Freedom of Information release and eventually disclose that 51 girls had been referred for elective double mastectomies .\n( 11 ) Both clinics have failed to conduct longitudinal studies or provide care for detransitioners who were mis-diagnosed , many of whom will attest to being fast-tracked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care was more appropriate to address underlying issues .\nOur recent Freedom of Information response shows a rapidly increasing and disproportionate number of gender-distressed children in Scotland \u2013 the referral rates have grown fifteen-fold in six years ( 12 ) and 1,254 children are either receiving treatment or are awaiting a first appointment ( 13 ) \u2013 almost twice the expected number given the relative population size with England , which has a comparable figure of 7,100 .\n( 14 ) A crisis point has surely been reached when concerned GPs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their health board or NHS Scotland , feel they have to write to a national newspaper outlining their worries that referring children to a gender clinic will actually harm , rather than help them ( 15 ) .\nThe political climate in Scotland is such that doctors who follow best therapeutic evidence rather than affirmation of a trans identity and medical treatment risk litigation for \u201c transphobia \u201d .\nIn January 2021 the then Cabinet Secretary for Health said \u201c We do not look to duplicate the work of the [ Cass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider the findings of the review when they become available \u201d ( 16 ) .\nHaving chosen not to undertake the necessary and fundamental work to analyse the evidence and determine the best treatments , it is wholly incumbent on the Scottish Government to take heed of the outcomes and advice of those who have .\nHowever , the Government has instead forged ahead with a \u00a32 million allocation of funds this year , primarily aimed at addressing waiting times ( 17 ) and an update to the Gender Reassignment Protocol ( GRP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn our view , both these projects must be halted and reassessed in light of the interim Cass report .\nThe GRP update is looking to follow the new WPATH guidelines ( 19 ) which are not based on evidence , follow an affirmation-only model and now also seem to incorporate eunuch as a gender identity ( 20 ) \u2013 something we hope the Scottish Government does not wish to introduce into our schools .\nThere is little point cutting waiting lists to allow quicker access to a service which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to children .\nIt would be irresponsible and negligent of the Scottish Government to continue down this path .\nDr Cass concludes that \u201c A fundamentally different service model is needed which is more in line with other paediatric provision \u201d .\nOf course , the pathway for children confused about gender is set long before they reach Sandyford \u2019 s door , in a large part due to the Scottish Government \u2019 s irresponsible policies in schools which advocate affirmation-only ( 21 ) .\nPolitical lobbying groups such as LGBT Youth are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change sex , and this is reinforced by teachers who have received training from the same groups \u2013 none of which have medical or educational expertise .\nPupils who are confused about gender are receiving the message that there is something wrong with their body that needs to be fixed and teachers are unquestioningly \u201c socially transitioning \u201d pupils , often changing names and pronouns behind their parents backs .\nAs Dr Cass states , these are not neutral interventions , and are being done without medical oversight and are incredibly damaging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that political impartiality should be reinstated in schools and lobbying groups not permitted to continue introducing unscientific beliefs to children , especially organisations that have already been found by Scottish Ministers to have introduced school guidance which was \u201c not legal \u201d ( 22 ) .\nIt would be helpful if the Government would issue a message similar to that by the Department of Education which states harmful stereotypes should not be reinforced and no inferences should be drawn about a gender identity from a child \u2019 s personality or preference for certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools work with external groups that produce such material ( 23 ) .\nWe hope you agree that there is ample evidence in the interim report that is alarming and needs immediate attention , and appreciate the implications for the upcoming plans to legislate for banning conversion therapy and to make Gender Recognition Certificates ( GRC ) available for under-18s .\nThe joint submission from Stonewall and others ( 24 ) is of the opinion that therapy for gender-distressed children should be focussed on understanding and learning to accept their stated gender identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversion therapy .\nThis is contrary to evidenced therapeutic practice and Cass points out there are many causes of a child \u2019 s distress and many pathways to a number of outcomes , only one of which will be an adult trans identity .\nCounsellors and therapists should be able to fully explore issues and help a child feel comfortable with their body , without any pressure of possible criminalisation .\nEven now concerns have been raised about the chilling effect of the Memorandum of Understanding ( 25 ) and the likelihood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirmation by way of a GRC ( 26 ) , on what may turn out to be a transient trans identity .\nWe would welcome a meeting for further discussion and look forward to hearing what steps will be

government to collapse in a few months or even weeks .\nBut it didn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scottish electorate was so impressed with the competence and verve of Salmond \u2019 s administration that after four years they rewarded him with the only one-party majority in the Scottish Parliament \u2019 s history , returning a staggering 69 SNP MSPs on a share of the vote that had leapt from 32 % to 45 % .\nSalmond delivered promptly on the primary duty of any SNP leader \u2013 an independence referendum .\nThe Edinburgh Agreement was signed just 18 months later , after a negotiation in which Salmond outmanoeuvered David Cameron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scottish Parliament deciding the question , date and franchise .\nSadly , despite taking Yes from a 70-30 deficit to neck-and-neck , the campaign ultimately failed , and Salmond resigned after losing the vote 55-45 .\nAnd then Nicola Sturgeon took over .\nSturgeon has now presided over five Scottish and UK general elections as SNP leader , the same number as Salmond ( including his first in 1999 ) .\nThe graph of SNP support in those elections looks like this : Despite her reputation as an electoral asset , Sturgeon \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relative failure .\nThe 2015 landslide was clearly Salmond \u2019 s legacy .\nOf the 60 months between the previous UK election and that one , Salmond had been First Minister for 54 of them \u2013 it was his record the SNP fought the 2015 election on , and nothing happened in those other six months that would justify Sturgeon claiming any of the credit for the result .\n( If you disagree , please name it in the comments . )\nSince inheriting that golden chalice , Sturgeon has achieved nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of the ones she lost two years earlier 2021 : failed to either regain the SNP \u2019 s Holyrood majority or increase its vote share \u2013 it actually fell fractionally , from 44.1 % to 44 % .\nIt barely needs saying that these failures came despite vastly more favourable circumstances .\nSturgeon had resources and wealth at her disposal that Salmond could only dream of , thanks to the party membership quintupling between the indyref and the election of 56 MPs , with the resultant bonanza in both membership fees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SNP is now wholly dependent to balance its books ) .\nShe had astonishingly inept opponents in Theresa May and Boris Johnson , where Salmond had had to contend with big beasts like Tony Blair , Gordon Brown and ( compared to May and Johnson , at least ) David Cameron .\nShe had Brexit , a weak Tory minority government , the catastrophically-handled coronavirus pandemic and stratospheric levels of Westminster incompetence and corruption handed to her on a plate to exploit .\nYet Sturgeon couldn \u2019 t parlay any of that into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SNP .\nSalmond inherited a party on 22 % of the vote and doubled it to 45 % by the time of his last election in charge .\nSturgeon has struggled for seven years just to stand still at that point , even as Labour and the Tories have torn themselves apart over Brexit/Jeremy Corbyn and the Lib Dems have collapsed into total irrelevance .\nBut in governance terms her report card is far , far worse than that .\nGood governance was Alex Salmond \u2019 s secret weapon .\nHe realised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to independence was to show them that Scots could do a good job of running their own country , and as shown above , he put that theory into practice \u2013 mainly by putting the best people he had available into ministerial jobs .\nWhen Sturgeon took over , her first act was to overturn that policy and use genitalia as the main determinant of who should be in her Cabinet .\nFor some of us , that was the very first warning signal .\nGender quotas are highly unpopular with the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the best person to be in the job , even if that means a given group is disproportionately male or female at any particular time .\nAnd based on its record since 2015 , it \u2019 s very hard to argue that the Scottish Government has been putting the best people in the job .\nHomelessness in Scotland , for example , fell in all but one year of Alex Salmond \u2019 s administration ( there was a tiny increase in 2008 ) .\nBy the time he left office it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that improvement stalled immediately when Sturgeon took office , and the numbers have been rising again for almost all of her reign .\nThey rose in 2016/17 , rose again in 2017-18 , rose again in 2018-19 , and again in 2019-20 , a cumulative increase of 10 % since the 2016 Holyrood election .\nHow about health ?\nThe headline stat most beloved of the Scottish press in the last 15 years has been A & E waiting times .\nUnder Alex Salmond the percentage of patients waiting more than four hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous Labour administration to an average of around 7 % ( tending to fluctuate higher in winter and lower in summer ) .\nWhen he resigned after the indyref in September 2014 , the figure stood at 6.5 % .\nFive years later it was regularly over 10 % and had grown to a peak of 16 % shortly before the COVID pandemic , before dropping due to lockdown restrictions .\nIt \u2019 s now more than twice that figure , at 34 % .\nThe country has also seen spiralling numbers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every year Sturgeon has been in charge .\nIn Salmond \u2019 s last year in charge the figure was 613 , but has now more than doubled .\nAnd for the first time in recorded history , life expectancy in Scotland was falling ( and inequality of outcomes widening ) even BEFORE the coronavirus pandemic .\nAs for COVID itself , well , it \u2019 s probably best if we just don \u2019 t talk about the care homes scandal .\nAfter all , who could ever have foreseen that dumping thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of highly vulnerable people in the country might be a bad idea ?\nAnd mindbogglingly , unbelievably , criminally , not just untested ones but also ones who were already known to definitely have COVID .\nOn education \u2013 something Sturgeon has repeatedly claimed is her priority \u2013 it \u2019 s difficult to compare figures , because the Scottish Government has pulled out of most international statistics programmes .\nPossibly because the results in the ones it \u2019 s still in are bad enough already .\nWhat we do know is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poor pupils was narrowed significantly between 2009-15 by Salmond \u2019 s administration , but as with homelessness , the improvement ended almost overnight when Sturgeon took over .\nAnd the gap is now widening again .\nThe same pattern manifests yet again if you look at crime , the last of the main areas of devolved responsibility .\nAfter plummeting to a record low under Salmond ( from 420,000 the year he entered Bute House to 256,000 the year he left it , a drop of almost 40 % ) , crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took over .\nThe rise is still slight , since Police Scotland have mostly been focusing their attention on women tweeting pictures of ribbons to bit-part soap-opera actors and arresting/imprisoning pro-independence activists like Manny Singh , Craig Murray , Mark Hirst and of course Alex Salmond himself for trumped-up non-crimes \u2013 good luck getting them to even bother coming out if you get burgled \u2013 but it \u2019 s a striking and abrupt halt to the previous trend of unbroken improvement .\nThese actions are symptoms of a Scottish justice system which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaccountable that its most senior officer , Lord Advocate James Wolffe , was able to admit publicly to a \u201c malicious prosecution \u201d which put more innocent men through hell and will likely cost the public purse upwards of \u00a3100m , without having to resign or indeed suffering any sort of consequences whatsoever .\nEven despite this , the Scottish Government has suffered a long string of humiliating legal defeats , from Named Person : to the botched attempts to reform gender legislation : and some over its pathological terror of any kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and numerous attempts to either hide data or pressure scrutinising bodies into doctoring their reports to show the government in a more favourable light .\nThe phenomenon was most spectacularly demonstrated , of course , in the astonishing and almost countless obstructions of the inquiry into the Scottish Government \u2019 s attempt to imprison the former FM on false harassment charges .\nAnd Salmond wasn \u2019 t an isolated case .\nThose in the independence movement who Sturgeon finds in some way inconvenient or threatening , but who haven \u2019 t yet been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacked and removed or sidelined by the SNP instead , most visibly Joanna Cherry and Mark McDonald .\nMeanwhile SNP MPs and MSPs line up in the Unionist media \u2013 which Sturgeon has bribed with millions of pounds of taxpayers \u2019 money \u2013 to \u201c declare war on \u201d prominent grassroots independence supporters .\nFortunately , the rule of law is now optional in Scotland .\nObeying laws you don \u2019 t like is now merely \u201c encouraged \u201d rather than being something you actually have to do .\nThe applies particularly if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as in the case of Glasgow City Council who in April felt able to tell a Scottish court \u2013 which found the council had breached its duty to provide a suitable home for a family with an autistic child \u2013 that it simply had no intention of complying with the court \u2019 s order .\nOr Sturgeon \u2019 s new best friends , the Scottish Greens .\nEven the making of the law will soon be purely an SNP matter , bypassing the need for the involvement of the Scottish Parliament entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage to get yourself arrested and imprisoned ( perhaps for one of the crimes that are still considered serious , such as misgendering or ribboning ) , you can just tell the police you \u2019 re a woman and at least get locked up in a nice women \u2019 s prison to serve your sentence , no questions asked .\nWhere the previous administration delivered huge infrastructure projects like the Queensferry Crossing and the Borders Railway essentially on time and on budget ( it was also Salmond also signed off on the Aberdeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts as leader ) , Sturgeon \u2019 s government has overseen a string of high-profile failures , like the children \u2019 s hospital that finally opened two years late at an additional cost of tens of millions of pounds : and the still-unfolding scandal of the CalMac ferries , which aren \u2019 t anywhere remotely close to finished five years after being \u201c launched \u201d as empty shells with painted-on windows , in a striking metaphor for Sturgeon \u2019 s rule \u2013 the bridge of the Glen Sannox looks like one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in response to FOI requests , hiding what \u2019 s really going on .\nThe ships are so far \u00a3150 million over budget , and all the key paperwork regarding the contract has mysteriously gone missing .\nIn every case they were warned well in advance , but ploughed on regardless , pausing only to set fire to the paper trail to cover their tracks .\nBut the Scottish Government doesn \u2019 t like taking advice , particularly advice that interferes with its dogged attempts to foist Queer Theory on the nation \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to ignore the opposition or media critics , but quite another to ride roughshod over your own Children \u2019 s Commissioner .\nOr your own very expensive legal counsel .\nAnd of course , it cares for the views of the electorate even less ( unless it \u2019 s an election day ) .\nPoll after poll after poll finds that voters of every age , sex , class and party are strenuously opposed to the SNP \u2019 s plans to redefine the entire concept of womanhood out of existence , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trans pressure groups lavish public funding and the keys to Bute House while refusing to fund or even meet women \u2019 s organisations who want to defend their rights .\nIt took two years of fighting the Scottish Government \u2019 s attempts to block Freedom Of Information requests before it was revealed that they \u2019 d risked hundreds of millions of pounds issuing guarantees to steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta .\nAttempted rescues of Prestwick Airport and BiFab have also been costly failures .\nThe Scottish Government still hasn \u2019 t taken over numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under its control years ago but which unfortunately fell into the remit of the serially useless but apparently unsackable Shirley-Anne Somerville .\nNumerous other promises have been broken .\nIt \u2019 s also failed to implement the long-promised serious land reforms , to the extent that the party \u2019 s own conference rejected its watered-down draft bill \u2013 one of the first key policies authored under Sturgeon \u2013 in 2015 .\nSix years later nothing had improved .\nBut the views of the membership have long since ceased to be of any relevance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chilling detail here .\n( The SNP hasn \u2019 t even held an in-person conference since 2019 , sticking to cursory and strictly stage-managed online events with no decision-making power despite every other party going back to proper conferences months ago . )\nAnd most recently we \u2019 ve learned that the Scottish Government can \u2019 t even conduct a simple once-a-decade headcount without making a complete balls of it .\nThe figures are brutal , and a 15-year measuring period tells a very misleading story .\nThe truth of the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 2007 , and they have been not at all alike .\nThe first was a successful , efficient , competent one led by Alex Salmond , which grew steadily in popularity as it improved outcomes in almost all devolved areas AND managed to secure and hold an independence referendum during which support for Yes increased by 50 % .\nThe second had an entirely different character .\nAssembled on ideological grounds rather than ability , it has undone and reversed most of the improvements made by its predecessor , failed to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shattered the unity of the Yes movement and failed to increase support for its supposed raison d \u2019 etre by so much as a single point in seven years .\nIt \u2019 s like asking someone \u201c Do you think this has been a good football season for Celtic and Dundee ?\n\u201d and only offering them a Yes/No answer .\nThe public have noticed the performances detailed in this article .\nIn 2015 , shortly after Salmond \u2019 s departure from Bute House , 51 % of Scots said they were satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of health , with just 22 % dissatisfied .\nAnd in 2017 a Panelbase poll found that 45 % of voters thought the NHS had improved because of the Scottish Parliament while just 20 % thought it had gotten worse .\nBut when the company asked an almost identical question last week , those numbers had flipped in just five years under Nicola Sturgeon \u2013 just 22 % of Scots now think the NHS has improved in the last 15 years while 56 % think it \u2019 s getting worse .\nThe poll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scots believe education has improved under the SNP , with 46 % saying it \u2019 s worsened , and a similar level of dissatisfaction with the direction of travel on crime .\nObservant readers will have noticed that these figures mean that \u2013 at most \u2013 only half of SNP voters think the party has governed well under Sturgeon .\nPrevious polls , however , have suggested that they \u2019 re willing to overlook her administration \u2019 s long catalogue of hapless domestic failures , brazen corruption , obsessive secrecy , calamitous mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obsession with wildly unpopular policies , the creation of scores of nepotistic quangocracies , growing amounts of sexual sleaze , the destruction of party democracy , and sometimes just sheer facepalming farce .\nThe reason for that forgiveness is because they inexplicably perceive that she \u2019 s in some way making progress towards a second independence referendum .\nWhen they finally realise that they \u2019 ve been fleeced and taken for mugs on a second indyref too , there may yet be a bitter reckoning .", "author": "Rev.

announcement of the supposed routemap to an independence referendum , and we \u2019 ve had some time to analyse it properly .\nYou \u2019 re not going to like it much .\nAs yet , nobody knows why the Lord Advocate referred the matter directly to the Supreme Court before the passing of the referendum bill .\nThere has been speculation , though , that this was a result of the Lord Advocate , whose assertion of belief that the bill was within Parliament \u2019 s powers \u2013 intra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be required in order to present the bill to Parliament , refusing to do so .\nWe have no way of knowing whether that \u2019 s true , but it \u2019 s certainly a plausible explanation .\nBecause as noted by the Telegraph yesterday , doing it this way creates a very major problem which would otherwise have been avoided by passing the bill first .\nThe problem is that just last year , the Scottish Government itself \u2013 while inexplicably opposing Martin Keatings \u2019 private attempt to establish whether Holyrood could run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued that the matter couldn \u2019 t possibly be settled until a bill was passed , because the bill could be amended during the Parliamentary process and therefore the court wouldn \u2019 t actually know what bill it was making a ruling on .\nSo immediately we \u2019 re locked in an unbreakable loop \u2013 the Supreme Court refuses to make a ruling because there \u2019 s no final bill to make a ruling on , but there can \u2019 t be a bill for the Supreme Court to rule on , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission for it until the Supreme Court has ruled on its legality .\nNow , we could stop the article there .\nBut for the sake of argument , let \u2019 s say the Telegraph is wrong .\nLet \u2019 s be super-optimistic and assume the Supreme Court DOES accept the reference and make a judgement .\nJoanna Cherry told us this week that if that happened , the issue would be heard in the autumn and we \u2019 d get the ruling before Christmas .\nBut even in that extremely rose-tinted version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an indyref in 2023 is stone cold dead .\nTo understand why we need to look at the process of passing a bill , as detailed on the Scottish Government website .\nLet \u2019 s imagine we get really lucky and the Supreme Court rules in the Scottish Government \u2019 s favour ( something almost nobody thinks will actually happen ) , just before Holyrood shuts down for the festive period .\nTo be as generous to Nicola Sturgeon as humanly possible , let \u2019 s make the assumption that because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maximum speed , with no sort of interruptions or disruptions or delays .\nWe \u2019 ll assume there \u2019 s no public consultation , that all committee steps take in effect no time at all ( ie they \u2019 re all rushed through during the statutory minimum wait periods ) , and that each stage of the bill begins on the first available day after the previous one .\nThese are the MINIMUM time periods laid down by law for various stages , so let \u2019 s just quickly do some arithmetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 weeks ( three months ) , starting from the 8th of January when Holyrood opens for business after the Christmas recess .\nBut there are 23 further recess days inside that timeframe ( in February and April ) , which takes us almost into May \u2013 10 months from now .\nSo even with no hold-ups of any kind , that \u2019 s the earliest a referendum bill can now possibly be passed .\nAnd in reality there are some really big flies in that ointment .\nOne of them lives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliamentary-procedure experts , but Crown consent ( which comes between Stage 1 and Stage 2 ) seems a pretty significant hurdle on a straight reading of the law .\nOne would imagine that the Queen would consider the potential break-up of her kingdom as a matter which affected her \u201c prerogative , private interests or hereditary revenues \u201d , particularly as she \u2019 ll have been advised to that effect by her government in Westminster , and if she does then that \u2019 s the whole thing buggered and stabbed and dead in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s assume an optimal scenario where the Crown elects not to interfere in politics .\nEven with the Queen and the Supreme Court now on board we still have to get past the UK government , because at the \u201c Reconsideration Stage \u201d we bump into this : We can pretty safely assume that the ( UK ) Secretary of State will have objections on some or all of those grounds , and so a Section 35 order will be filed , preventing Royal Assent , and everyone \u2019 s off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case against the UK government \u2019 s attempt to prorogue Parliament in 2019 was filed at the end of July and , on an extremely expedited Supreme Court appeal timetable , judgement was delivered two months later .\nIt seems highly unlikely that the Supreme Court would be willing to expedite an indyref case so quickly , since no matter what WE might think , there \u2019 s no actual material emergency here as far as the court is concerned .\nSo realistically that would be at least a few more months from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even in our wildly , delusionally optimistic best-case scenario takes us easily into the 2023 summer recess around the start of July , which will run up to next September .\nAnd remember , we have to have an actual campaign period of several months after all this , not to mention all the administrative preparation necessary to actually run the referendum , which means that even without a Section 35 challenge we \u2019 ll have completely run out of 2023 .\nThat takes us into spring , because you can \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or February , and \u2013 if there hadn \u2019 t been one already \u2013 we \u2019 d be looking at an imminent UK general election by then ( while there doesn \u2019 t HAVE to be one until December 2024 , the government will want to pick a favourable time before that ) .\nSo the indyref would be kaput and it \u2019 d have to be a plebiscite election or nothing .\nSo : it is manifestly obvious to anyone remotely sane that even if everything goes perfectly there \u2019 s absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by next October , or indeed even in 2024 .\nThe First Minister is not serious .\nThis \u201c routemap \u201d is aimed only at the hyper-gullible and blindly faithful ( sadly still plentiful in the Yes movement ) , and those entities who make a cynical profit out of trying to sustain the fantasy .\nIt \u2019 s a plan which \u2013 by the Scottish Government \u2019 s own actions \u2013 is both designed and guaranteed to fail .\nBack down the mountain again , folks .\nPut your flags and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to see here .", "author": "Rev.

grew up in the aftermath of the failed rising of 1745 , living through the harsh and brutal consequences inflicted on Scotland by the Act of Proscription .\nIn \u201c Earnest Cry and Prayer \u201d the Bard was responding to the UK Parliament \u2019 s Scotch Distillery Act of 1786 , a protectionist act aimed at supporting London \u2019 s gin industry by hiking duties on whisky sold in England and by taxing Scottish still capacity .\nIt was a call for action to Scotland \u2019 s 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood the destructive power of such acts .\nHe asked which Scot would not feel his blood boil at seeing the resources of the nation \u2019 s stills destroyed and its wealth plundered , roaring to the MPs : As the UK Parliament is set to return from its summer holiday it is hard not to see continued parallels over the ages and again today .\nThen it was whisky , for decades it was black gold and now it \u2019 s our renewable fortune .\nAnd as fate would have it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues to seize our resources for the benefit of the City , still we have a feeble 45 willing to bear it .\nBefore she set off on her own summer tour of the Edinburgh Fringe and Book Festivals , the announcement by the First Minister of her route map to indyref 2 briefly injected much fire into the bellies of the independence movement .\nBut as the cool heads in the independence stepped back to think about what was announced , it became quickly clear that this was not the masterstroke that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a gush of fury and vitriol thought it was .\nNor , for one very important reason , was it the same plan previously advocated for .\nBack in 2019 we knew the path before us : there would be a General Election within a matter of months and there would be a Holyrood election in 2021 .\nSenior figures such as Ian Blackford warned that a Plan B wasn \u2019 t needed as victory at a UK election would blow away any opposition Boris Johnson had to a \u201c Gold Standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that if Johnson \u2019 s Government wasn \u2019 t willing to accept a triple mandate that the Scottish Government already had then a fourth and a fifth mandate would make no difference , and so it turned out .\nFor Plan B to work we needed the First Minister to issue the Prime Minister the rules of the game we would play \u2013 firstly that a General Election victory back in 2019 would be the final mandate for a referendum that would be sought , and that if Westminster persisted to refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own vote .\nIf the UK Government used courtrooms to stop the people having their say then they would make their voices heard at the ballot box by turning the 2021 election into a de facto referendum on independence .\nThis required nuance .\nIt required a concerted campaign at each step of the way to build up popular support in Scotland to ensure that each stage on this journey secured the required international recognition , thanks to the popular legitimacy forged in the process by the people .\nOn paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still wants a referendum by agreement with the UK Government through the granting of a Section 30 order .\nBut by virtue of the imprudence of referring the matter directly to the UK Supreme Court , Boris Johnson was allowed to spend the summer on a beach rather than being forced to answer the question as to why the people of Scotland are denied their right to self-determination in this supposed union of equals .\nAnd so the weakest Prime Minister in history got to step down this week as Prime Minister having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-hearted attempts to respect successive mandates for an independence referendum .\nAs for the Supreme Court , is there a single member of the Scottish Government that believes that the London justices will side with them ?\nThe same court eviscerated the Scottish Government on the matter of the UN Charter On The Rights Of The Child , and that was an issue that every single member of the Scottish Parliament voted for .\nBy the manner in which the Lord Advocate has asked the question on competency , you could be excused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetorical question .\nDorothy Bain is a highly competent , experienced lawyer , but why the First Minister would appoint a Lord Advocate who doesn \u2019 t have confidence in the right of the Scottish Parliament to assert its own sovereignty is a question only Nicola Sturgeon can answer .\nThe Supreme Court may simply use the Scottish Government \u2019 s own arguments against them from the Keatings case at the Court Of Session .\nThe Lord Advocate argued then that it would be premature to make a decision as no bill had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhat \u2019 s different now ?\nThe Supreme Court may simply dismiss the case as premature and send the Scottish Government home to think again .\nThis would of course cause an almighty problem for the Scottish Government as the Lord Advocate has all but engraved in tablet that she doesn \u2019 t think the Scottish Parliament has the competence to hold an indyref .\nIf this eventuality prevails then the Scottish Government best get on with the job of separating the job Lord Advocate as both head of Crown Office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nKeeping the current incumbent in the former and appointing an individual willing to advocate the position of Scottish Ministers to the latter might be a good starting point .\nHowever , all of this will be academic if the Supreme Court do what many expect it will relish to do \u2013 put the Scottish Government back in the box where the London establishment believes it belongs .\nHow different things could have been if the Scottish Government pursued its mandate ( s ) with democratic determination .\nThe argument the the Scottish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referendum on independence is much stronger if it \u2019 s sent to the Supreme Court by UK Law Officers after the people \u2019 s parliament of Scotland had decreed that there should be such a referendum .\nIt \u2019 s certainly a much stronger position to stand on than asking the Supreme Court , yourself , to get you out of a political fix .\nAnd so , as opposed to having a strategic plan to bring the country with us , increasing support each step of the way as Scotland is denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and institutions we didn \u2019 t vote for and who don \u2019 t have Scotland \u2019 s interests at heart , the plan to hold a referendum will be over by Christmas .\nAt this stage in my original \u201c Plan B \u201d I proposed that a pro-independence majority of seats in an election would act as the mandate Scotland needed to enter straight into independence negotiations with the UK Government .\nThis of course should \u2019 ve been a Scottish Parliament election .\nWhy ?\nBecause it \u2019 s our franchise .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as hundreds of thousands of new Scots from a de facto Referendum is an act of folly that stacks the odds against us .\nOn the back of a resourced campaign to get to that stage , that built a broad majority coalition in favour of the legitimacy of that approach , team Scotland could have marched to Downing Street to demand the UK Government come to the table .\nBut that \u2019 s not what Nicola Sturgeon has proposed .\nAt first Angus Robertson refused to answer the question of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indyref would be , and then John Swinney was briefed against by special advisors that he had given the wrong answer when he said that a majority of seats would be the benchmark .\nThe First Minister says that an SNP majority of votes would be required .\nBut that requires the opposition to play along with the idea that the election is a proxy referendum .\nIn general elections people take issues such as the cost of living , the state of public services , and their general dislike of the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to their own priority issues , such as the SNP \u2019 s hugely unpopular plans for gender reform .\nSo demanding that the only way to exercise your support for Scottish independence is by voting for a single political party , warts and all , is doomed for failure .\nNobody demanded that Boris Johnson required a majority of votes to take Scotland out of the EU , it was deemed democratic for him to do so with a majority of seats .\nIf this is to be the way forward then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ballot paper is free from the drawbacks and tribalism of party politics and instead takes the form of a united front , with a single candidate in every seat who stands for independence .\nIt is welcome that the SNP state they will have a debate on this policy at their conference next month .\nBut it \u2019 s time for senior figures in the party and across the movement to speak up .\nIf they don \u2019 t , by the stroke of a pen , the First Minister will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made between Alex Salmond and Donald Dewar , that the Scottish Parliament had the right to hold a referendum if that \u2019 s what the people wanted .\nWe are now subjects of yet another Tory Prime Minister that we haven \u2019 t voted for .\nIt \u2019 s long past time for the Scottish Government to start getting serious in its efforts to bend Westminster to the will of Scotland , as it failed to do during the chaotic reigns of Theresa May and Boris Johnson .\nDozens of pro-independence MPs have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassment on the UK government through Parliamentary interventions .\nInstead of urging MPs to treat the House Of Commons with respect , they should be compelled to treat the Westminster establishment with the same respect that it treats Scotland .\nBritain has few friends in the world .\nThere has never been a better time to reach out to the world to make the case for Scottish independence whilst highlighting that the UK Government \u2013 who are willing to send arms elsewhere in the world to defend democracy \u2013 are suppressing the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAll of this is in the backdrop of hard pressed Scots asking themselves why they are being forced into destitution by soaring energy costs when we live in a land of energy plenty that is self-sufficient in gas and generates enough electricity through renewables to power every home in Scotland .\nWith motivated leadership , people are ready to follow a mass movement of popular protest and demonstration , led by example in the Commons .\nIt remains to be seen whether they \u2019 re given the opportunity .", "author": "Chris McEleny", "url": "https://wingsoverscotland.com/fire-water-burn/", "published": "Thu, 08 Sep 2022 10:43:47 +0000", "published_utc":

.\nBecause the SNP are now openly , publicly telling you that they \u2019 re never going to achieve independence for Scotland , nor even make any meaningful attempt at it .\nLet \u2019 s look at that statement for a moment \u2013 bearing in mind it comes from someone very close indeed to Nicola Sturgeon .\nThe last sentence is what the SNP have been telling us for the last six or seven years : that the UK government will be unable to democratically resist a mandate from the Scottish people for another indyref @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this as UK PM after UK PM has done precisely that \u2013 David Cameron then Theresa May then Boris Johnson then Liz Truss have resisted mandate after mandate after mandate with no difficulty whatsoever , and no sign that it \u2019 s caused them any sleepless nights .\nThe SNP have won eight elections in Scotland since the indyref : Westminster elections in 2015 , 2017 and 2019 , Holyrood elections in 2016 and 2021 , council elections in 2017 and 2022 and European election in 2019 .\nNone of them were close-run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 23 points over their nearest rival , and only the 2017 council election saw a winning margin in single digits .\nThere has

would have voted for it , just like the UK Parliament did for Brexit , and that would have been the end of the matter .\nThe UK Parliament did not require or seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EU .\nIt simply exercised its democratic right as the body representing the people .\nPro-Brexit MPs could , of course , point to the Brexit referendum itself as their mandate .\nBut now the SNP are telling us that even if an election they are treating as \u201c a de facto referendum \u201d delivers over 50 % of the vote , they \u2019 ll still simply go back to Westminster with their caps in their hands and \u201c demand \u201d another referendum like they \u2019 ve been doing for over half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election won \u2019 t be an indyref at all , but merely a referendum about a referendum , which the UK government will be under no obligation to attach any significance to , because the SNP itself has just given the UK government carte blanche to say no forever .\nSo if you wait ANOTHER two years for the SNP to actually do anything , it still won \u2019 t count .\nThey \u2019 ll just class it as yet another \u201c irresistible mandate \u201d , exactly the same as the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when they resist this one too \u2013 which they will , because why on Earth wouldn \u2019 t they ?\nWhat do they have to lose ?\nVotes in Scotland ?\nLOL \u2013 what will the SNP do ?\nMake the NEXT election ANOTHER two years down the line ANOTHER \u201c de facto referendum \u201d , then repeat forever when Westminster knocks that one back too ?\nThis is already their last-ditch Hail Mary option and they \u2019 ve just told you they don \u2019 t really mean it .\nWe \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for something we \u2019 re never going to be given .\nThe only way a de facto referendum can work is IF YOU ACTUALLY TREAT IT AS A REFERENDUM \u2013 that is to say , if you get over 50 % of the vote you DO go ahead and declare independence , bypassing the UK government and appealing for international recognition under the UN Charter , noting that all other peaceful avenues have been comprehensively exhausted .\nIt \u2019 s actually the way most countries in the last 100 years have done it @ @ @ @

wants .\nAnd at any point in these events , or if Alice needs treatment for any other gynaecological issue , she can be excluded from the female-only gynaecological ward ( if such a thing @ @ @ @ @ @

after the implementation of the Equality Act , the Equality & Human Rights Commission , are supporting the Scottish Government \u2019 s legal defence in court .\nYou read that right .\nThe body given the job of upholding the law covering nine protected characteristics of vulnerable groups believes that a GRC grants the holder a certificated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female and Alice becomes male and everyone else has to live with the consequences .\nFrom the age of 16 \u2013 even as low as 12 , if their coalition partners the Scottish Greens get their way \u2013 the Scottish Government wants any male to be able to acquire a GRC with no medical diagnosis , no gatekeeping and no safeguarding , and be legally female in every way .\nSo young girls and women will have to accept John as female at all times , even when giving us internal examinations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a female prison , on our hospital wards or in our changing rooms and toilets , whereas the Alices of the world will be forced to be male in

rang more true than on 23 November 2022 .\nLet \u2019 s be methodical about it .\nA panel comprising a majority of Scottish judges ruled definitively for the first time that Scotland was erased as a nation 315 years ago , and subsumed into England as a colony .\nRemarkably , the panel did so while insisting explicitly that it was doing no such thing , in a grave insult to all intelligent people .\nIf Scotland is not a colony , it must follow that it is a country , and no country can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question about how they wish to be governed .\nAny place which CAN be so prevented by the rulers of an external country is a de facto colony of that country , by any commonly-understood definition of the word .\nYou can argue legitimately that Scotland is not a colony .\nYou can argue legitimately that Scotland is not a country and gave up its people \u2019 s right to self-determination .\nWhat you can not do is legitimately argue both , because the two assertions contradict each other in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court was under no obligation to rule on that issue at all , which did not form part of the Lord Advocate \u2019 s referral .\nIt could simply have said \u201c a referendum clearly relates to reserved matters and is therefore outwith Holyrood \u2019 s powers , the end \u201d and left the arguments about self-determination to the politicians .\nBut the unnecessary addition of the reference to colonies ironically simply made it look like an arm of an arrogant colonial power slapping down the natives .\nIt was a tin-eared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some inexplicable reason , many supporters of the Union who habitually describe themselves as \u201c proud Scots \u201d took the judgement as their cue to gloat sneeringly all over social media about the formal destruction of what they claim as one of their own national identities , presumably in the bizarre belief \u2013 comprehensively disproven by literally everything that \u2019 s happened in Scottish politics since 2007 \u2013 that such an attitude will be in some way advantageous to their cause .\nSome who wished to appear at least superficially less obnoxious actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further , by insisting that the Court \u2019 s ruling still left open a democratic route to the very self-determination the Court had just absolutely expressly ruled that Scotland didn \u2019 t have .\nBut Tomkins \u2019 assertion is clearly drivel of the lowest order .\nThe current UK government , like those of the recent past and any future ones , will be under no obligation whatsoever to grant a referendum even if polling showed 100 % of Scots wanted one .\nThey have their own clear democratic mandates to reject the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their refusal to even consider the matter for another 20 or more years under any circumstances .\nTomkins \u2019 blithe statement that any UK government would behave according to the gentlemanly spirit of fair play is belied by , well , pretty much anything that any UK government has said or done since 2014 , and it \u2019 s embarrassing for an academic of supposed intellect to punt such tommyrot .\nGiven how long the SNP have had to plan for the possibility of this judgement , their official response would have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the threshold of \u201c pathetic \u201d .\nNicola Sturgeon gave a long waffling statement of indescribable feebleness , with no discernible content whatsoever other than a vague commitment to commission some sort of party discussion on the subject at some unspecified point next year .\nShe backed it up with a shouty but equally vacuous speech in front of a few hundred people huddled shivering outside the Scottish Parliament that evening .\nBut \u201c Scottish democracy \u201d can not be defended when it \u2019 s already been lost .\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given plenty of warning .\nSturgeon reiterated in general terms ( while refusing to be drawn on any specifics ) that the new plan was to conduct a plebiscitary general election , but offered no explanation for why we had to wait two years for it .\nIt is wholly within her power to stand down as First Minister , have the SNP and Greens block the election of a replacement and thereby force a new Holyrood election which could serve as the plebiscite , and would have the considerable benefit of including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) who statistically favour independence and would be able to vote in a Scottish election but not a UK one .\nWe can not think of a single valid reason for the First Minister not to adopt this strategy , given the urgency with which she insists the matter of Scotland \u2019 s democracy must be asserted and the multiple obvious reasons why it would be preferable to do this via a Holyrood election rather than a Westminster one .\nBut also , in an interminably dull press conference following her speech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enquire of Sturgeon why a further two-year delay was ncecessary , nor did any of them think to ask why she couldn \u2019 t have obtained the Supreme Court \u2019 s ruling back in 2016 and given Scotland the opportunity to vote before it was dragged from the EU .\nOf all the wretched , rank and rotten organs of Scotland in 2022 \u2013 and in the face of particularly stiff competition from both the ruling party and the opposition \u2013 its media remains perhaps the worst

, the wider public responded with an embarrassingly dismal turnout at a series of protest events .\nAround 300 to 400 turned up in each of Glasgow and Edinburgh ( despite the rarity value of the Dear Leader herself deigning to actually appear at an independence event in the latter case ) , and a few dozen elsewhere .\nMost of them resembled not so much a revolutionary mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queue waiting for a delayed No.23 .\nFrom the few pictures posted on social media we estimate the total attendance at all the events combined at well below 1,500 \u2013 less than 0.1 % of the people who voted Yes in 2014 .\nNot that we can blame those who didn \u2019 t show \u2013 it was a cold , miserable November evening and pointlessly standing around in a drizzly town square to mutter and grumble

article , but it \u2019 s worth quickly going over it again , because there \u2019 s nothing on Earth more tedious than boneheads on social media going \u201c Oh , you slag off the SNP but what \u2019 s YOUR plan if you \u2019 re so clever ?\n\u201d , who haven \u2019 t bothered to read any of the dozen times we \u2019 ve already answered that question since 25 months ago .\nThis is it .\nThis is our plan .\nTry listening this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and force a general election .\nThis is very easily done within the current rules , despite what the terrified , panicking cowards of the SNP and some of Scotland \u2019 s more clueless mainstream media hacks will try to tell you .\nAll that \u2019 s required is for Nicola Sturgeon to resign and for the election of a replacement to be blocked by the pro-independence parties who have 72 of the Parliament \u2019 s 129 seats .\nThe above , as we \u2019 ve already noted and entirely as we \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is simply completely and embarrassingly factually incorrect .\nThe standing orders of the Scottish Parliament very explicitly DO allow MSPs to vote against a First Ministerial candidate as well as for one .\nEven if some sort of procedural semantic chicanery ( something we addressed in our previous piece ) was to somehow result in a Unionist being elected as the new FM , as erroneously suggested by Mr Farquharson above , the SNP and Greens would still command a comfortable majority of votes in the chamber and could simply bring the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no confidence .\nSo it is , and this can not be emphasised enough , a foolproof plan .\nUnder the Scotland Act and the Standing Orders of the Scottish Parliament , there is NO outcome of Nicola Sturgeon resigning that does not end in a general election .\nSo remember this : the SNP and Greens can trigger an election at any time they choose to from today onwards .\nThe pro-independence parties all run the election on the same manifesto comprising the text below .\n( The paragraphs in italics are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We believe that the Scottish people are sovereign , and we hereby announce our intention to declare Scotland independent and submit that intention to the will of the people in this election for their approval .\nAccordingly , if pro-independence parties should secure more than 50 % of the constituency votes in this election , we will consider that a clear mandate to withdraw from the Treaty Of Union , declare Scotland to once more be an independent state , and seek recognition from the international community on the basis of Chapter 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the right of all peoples to self-determination , that self-determination having been expressed by this vote .\nShould the UK Government wish , we are willing to confirm that mandate via a referendum , to be held no later than three months from the date of the election , on the same question as that used in 2014 .\nIf no such referendum is requested or conducted , the declaration of independence based on the election result will automatically be considered to stand .\nUpon the secure establishment of independence , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWith regard to other policies , our current positions on all issues remain unchanged , and all future legislation will be brought before the Parliament , debated and voted on in the normal manner .\nAnd that \u2019 s it .\nYou win the vote , you have a legitimate democratic mandate to declare that Scotland rescinds the Treaty Of Union , citing the Claim Of Right in support , noting the UK government \u2019 s refusal to provide any other peaceful democratic route , and you ask the international community to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unilateral declaration is much less clean and tidy as a solution than a Section 30 referendum , but it \u2019 s a time-honoured method by which many nations have achieved their independence and there are no other credible options remaining now that the legal route has been extinguished .\nWe have absolutely nothing left to lose .\nThe specific beauty of doing it via a Holyrood election rather than a UK one is that it disarms the argument \u201c Oh , but the Unionists and media will refuse to treat a general election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of a UK general election that is in fact quite a strong argument , because while \u2013 as noted by Sir John Curtice the other day \u2013 it \u2019 s wholly legitimate for a party to stand for election on a single issue , Scotland is only 8 % of the UK population and so the media will be fully and properly entitled to focus on other issues most of the time .\nIt \u2019 s hard to win a campaign when your only policy is almost never discussed .\nBut in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which most of the seats in the Parliament will be decided on the basis of that single issue , the media and the other parties can not simply pretend it isn \u2019 t happening .\nHolyrood \u2019 s dual ballot system also defuses the claim that using the election as a de facto referendum belies the other serious issues facing the country .\nBecause if you \u2019 re using the list vote as a \u201c normal \u201d one while using the constituency ballot as your referendum , you still end up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country as normal .\nIn the 2021 Holyrood election , the SNP swept the vast majority of constituency seats , other than a few enclaves of Tories in the borders and Lib Dems in the Northern Isles .\nGiven current polling that would be almost certain to be replicated if the constituency vote was counted as a plebiscite election , because the SNP \u2019 s 45 % of support is plenty to win almost every seat under FPTP .\nAnd even if it wasn \u2019 t ( eg if Unionists fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted 100 % tactically for whichever Unionist party was in second place ) , the list would balance out any changes , using the 1.1m list votes for the SNP that were almost completely wasted last year .\nSo the Holyrood electoral system specifically enables the election to be used as a proxy referendum without causing any significant distortion to normal politics .\nIt \u2019 s possible for the indy parties to both have their cake and eat it , and for them to do so right now , not in two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has none of those advantages , AND is significantly arithmetically harder to win because you don \u2019 t get 16/17-year-olds or EU citizens , both of whom lean towards independence .\nIt is a stupendously obviously inferior alternative .\nIn fact , it \u2019 s a straight-up terrible one .\nIt is simply inconceivable that the SNP doesn \u2019 t know all of this .\nOf course it does .\nSo ask yourselves , SNP loyalists , why your party is ostensibly pursuing a dreadful plan riddled with huge gaping holes a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly will ) , and refusing to countenance what even a blind drunk idiot or Alex Cole-Hamilton would recognise as a much better one .\nPerhaps also ask yourselves why the party is going through the farcical pantomime of \u201c debating \u201d the issue in several months \u2019 time , when its own deputy leader has publicly announced that the matter has already been decided and one of the only two options has been discounted .\nIt \u2019 s almost as if , a cynical person might think , they were deliberately trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the situation rather than exploit people \u2019 s entirely justified anger at the Supreme Court ruling , which currently gives a Yes vote a huge lead .\nOr to put it more succinctly \u2013 why do you think the SNP seem so determined to lose ?", "author": "Rev.

since last night about the latest Ipsos Mori poll putting independence on 56 % , with the usual suspects getting over-excited .\nIt remains to be seen whether the figures represent a short blip of anger over the Supreme Court decision , a more sustained but still temporary period of Yes support like that of summer 2020 \u2013 spring 2021 , or a permanent shift in public opinion .\nSo as such they \u2019 re actually relatively uninteresting , although the SNP \u2019 s plan to do absolutely nothing to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to wait several months before even having a strategy conference , remains disturbing .\nBut what actually caught our eye about the poll were a couple of questions nobody else has reported on .\nThe headline figures on this question should be viewed in the context of reflexive party loyalty rather than any detailed assessment , because the SNP don \u2019 t come off all that much better .\n( Although the enormous 46-point difference in the case of \u201c standing up for Scotland \u2019 s interests \u201d is a striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite surprising that Labour even scores as high as 35 % . )\nBut what \u2019 s much more notable are the figures in the rightmost column , which shows significant ( mostly double-digit ) drops in trust for BOTH parties since 18 months ago .\nAnd the same was the case for the Tories .\nScottish voters , in short , are rapidly losing their faith in EVERYONE .\nAnd nowhere is that more starkly demonstrated than in another question .\nScottish Labour have been in opposition at Holyrood for 15 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve been the biggest opposition party .\nBefore that they \u2019 d ruled Scotland basically unchallenged for nearly 50 years .\nIt \u2019 s not as if they lack political experience .\nSo for barely a quarter of voters to consider them in a fit state to form the next Scottish Government \u2013 particularly at a time when UK Labour is 20 or more points ahead in UK polling \u2013 is a stat that beggars belief .\nScottish Labour have had a decade and a half to work out why they lost power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their inability to do so is one of the most remarkable political failures in the history of the entire UK .\nIn that time they \u2019 ve been led by Jack McConnell , Wendy Alexander , Iain Gray , Johann Lamont , Jim Murphy , Kezia Dugdale , Robert someone and Anas Sarwar , yet have steadily fallen further and further behind \u2013 defying all normal political trends \u2013 even as the SNP have disintegrated from a competent party of government to a shambolically inept and spiteful dictator cult .\nAs the charts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the popularity of Scotland \u2019 s other two main parties is holding them back .\nVoters are sullenly resigned to their awful options .\nIt \u2019 s that Scottish Labour keeps doing the same thing ( screaming \u201c SNP BAD !\n1979 !\nDivisive obsession !\n\u201d in a Union Jack suit ) over and over and over again , constantly expecting a different outcome .\nLobotomised mice in laboratories learn faster .\nThe Ipsos poll shows that almost 40 % of Scottish Labour \u2019 s remaining voters support independence , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet as far as we know not a single Labour MSP represents that view .\nThat is in itself quite extraordinary .\nIn any normally-functioning political party there would at least be factions and debate .\nBut this site is not suggesting and has never suggested that the branch office should adopt support for independence as a policy .\nThat would be asking far too much in several ways .\nWe \u2019 re also \u2013 very generously \u2013 assuming that Scottish Labour actually has any interest in forming a government , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , responsibility-free life of the opposition forever .\nBut it \u2019 s astonishing that it never even seems to occur to them that perhaps their current approach isn \u2019 t working and some serious thought about \u2013 for example \u2013 at least supporting the principle of Scottish self-determination might pay some dividends .\nAfter all , if you truly believe the Scottish people don \u2019 t want independence , why would you be afraid of letting them say so ?\nIf you were really sure they wanted to remain in the UK , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nLet the SNP hold as many referendums as they want .\nDeny them the grievances they thrive on .\nLet them exhaust the electorate \u2019 s patience .\nAs Wendy Alexander cried in a brief moment of clarity : \u201c Bring it on !\n\u201d But the Unionist parties don \u2019 t believe that .\nNo matter how many polls show a No lead , interrupted only rarely by those like yesterday \u2019 s , they remain terrified of the voice of the Scottish people , as demonstrated by one more question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plagued on all sides by its useless political class .\nNationalist and Unionist leaders alike exist in states of cowering fear , either of not getting what they want or getting it .\nNone has the courage to do anything differently , and as a result the country is trapped in a wretched spiral of ( badly ) managed decline without any hope of change .\nHistory suggests that ONE day someone \u2013 from one side or the other \u2013 will come along with the intelligence to see a way out , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut we see no signs that that day is coming any time soon .", "author": "Rev.

their work on it ) , and even when we went to the Believe In Scotland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and down for an eternity , it was impossible to find .\nBut eventually we had a brainwave and searched the site

outlet .\nBut it \u2019 s curious that McIntyre-Kemp chooses to attribute the claim in question to us , because the article it appears in didn \u2019 t originate here .\nIt was written and first published by Paul Kavanagh on his Wee Ginger Dug site in October 2013 , and we republished it a few days later as a favour to give it a bigger audience , and because the thrust of it is all true .\nWe billed it as a Comment piece and as such didn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , the supposed inaccuracy is barely detectable .\nThis was Kavanagh \u2019 s claim : That statement in fact agrees almost entirely with what McIntyre-Kemp said : McIntyre-Kemp concurs entirely that the duty on any Scotch sold to foreign customers by exporters in England is counted as English revenue .\nIndeed , it \u2019 s hard to discern exactly what he \u2019 s objecting to , except perhaps the phrase \u201c duty paid by our whisky industry \u201d , ( it \u2019 s paid by the buyers ) or the precise definitions @ @ @

and no way of verifying if either the trajectory or the claimed total bore any resemblance to reality .\nAnd quite where BiS was getting the \u00a350,000 to supposedly double the supposed

timely text , on a par with 1984 or The Crucible .\nDuring the opening scene , the everyman protagonist Berenger sits having coffee with a friend .\nMidway through their conversation , a rhino charges past the caf\u00e9 .\nBerenger is startled and concerned but his friend seems unperturbed , in denial that they even saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , Berenger watches in incredulity and terror as , one by one , every person around him , colleagues and friends , transform into rhinoceroses , the cause seemingly being part-infection , part-capitulation .\nIn the final scene , he stands at his window looking out over the carnage , and in a moment of desperation , tries to force himself to transform into a rhinoceros .\nDespite his efforts , he is unable to and upon regaining his senses , vows in a hopeless frenzy that he will never capitulate .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ analogy for how fascism and Nazism spread throughout Europe in the early 20th century but truthfully , it resonates with almost any

first rhinos heralding the arrival of gender ideology in the mainstream happened in 2015 , it is generally agreed .\nStonewall had firmly fastened the \u201c T \u201d onto \u201c LGB \u201d and \u201c Women \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and redrafted as \u201c Gender Studies \u201d .\n\u201c Intersectionality \u201d was the big fourth-wave feminist buzzword .\nI was at university at the time , in my third year , and remember exactly where I was when I glimpsed the animal : in a tutorial discussing Judith Butler \u2019 s \u201c Gender Trouble \u201d .\nI \u2019 m ashamed to say , my outlook was closer to Berenger \u2019 s friend than Berenger , although I did not deny the presence of the beast .\nMy reaction was closer to : \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fascinating !\nLet \u2019 s study it rather than immediately call the authorities to have it removed from civil society \u201d .\nIn my defence , I was 21 , extremely precocious and still suffering from imposter syndrome at being accepted into an elite university .\nCritical theory , as espoused by Butler , is a gift to the intellectually insecure as it wraps very simplistic ideas in poncy , impenetrable academic language and allows you to deconstruct anything , regardless of complexity , into a neat hierarchy of oppressor/oppressed .\nMoreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was presented as inherently truthful , with little or no invitation to challenge it from the tutor .\nThe rhino was stunning and brave , not aggressive , I was informed , and no more dangerous than a strapping grey unicorn .\nIn 2018 I had a considerably more uncomfortable brush with the gender rhino , one that frankly left me shaken .\nAfter graduating university , my first job was in a public library .\nThroughout the summer we held a reading challenge for primary school children and on the sign-up forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Boy \u201d , \u201c Girl \u201d or \u201c Other \u201d .\nIt was advised we asked each individual child which box they preferred to be ticked .\nSomewhere in the back of my mind , a kernel of sense began to stir but not enough for me to challenge it outright .\nNo , the harm didn \u2019 t truly hit home until a little boy , aged about six , came to the desk with his Mum , clutching a batman toy .\nI filled in his details then came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried to make a joke of it , lightly prompting : \u201c And , um\u2026you \u2019 re a boy , yes ?\n\u201d I will never forget the look of shock and hurt on his face , the confusion as he looked down at himself as if trying to understand what was making me doubt his sex .\nHis mother narrowed her eyes at me .\n( I \u2019 d have gone through me for a shortcut . )\nYou can scoff and sneer at my stupidity for ever having gone along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and maybe I deserve it , but gender ideology indoctrination runs deep for the young and idealistic , cloaked in the language of virtue and kindness .\nNonetheless , at that moment the hypnosis lifted , the spell ( curse ? )\nbroke .\nIt was as stark and harrowing as , well , a two-tonne horned beast rampaging towards me : This stuff makes no sense in the real world .\nOver the next few years , I began to see more and more rhinos .\nPronoun badges .\nBizarre new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I referred to someone as \u2018 she \u2019 after they announced they were a man , even if they made absolutely no change to their physicality or general demeanour , I \u2019 d be committing a transgression on a par with calling someone a racial slur .\nI watched as Professor Kathleen Stock was bullied from Sussex University by a small but lethally strong stampede , cheered on by rhinos in suits in the UCU .\nThey wreaked havoc in bookshops , stamping and eating up any text that challenged their dogma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hidden away lest they be trampled .\nThey invaded academia , publishing , the arts , the corporate world , the police force , education \u2013 even nurseries .\nBut that wasn \u2019 t the most horrifying thing .\nThe most horrifying thing was witnessing people in power who were not rhinos adorning horns and painting their faces grey in a bid to appease them .\nThe genius of Ionesco \u2019 s play is the titular animal .\nConsider all the other creatures he could have chosen and why they wouldn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A chimpanzee , for instance , would have been too complex ; they are too closely related to humans , too intelligent , they arguably could be won over , even communicated with to some degree .\nA lion or tiger or other carnivorous animal wouldn \u2019 t work either , as they \u2019 d have too much of an understandable motive in attacking humans .\nBut a rhinoceros is dangerous by the sheer virtue of its size and clumsiness .\nAny violence it commits towards humans is not because it feels threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s in a bad mood and because it can .\nWhat \u2019 s more , a rhino doesn \u2019 t have to be on the attack to do a great deal of damage .\nEven the most well-intentioned pack of rhinos , waddling as carefully as they can through a building , will end up crushing toes , crumbling the walls , and knocking things over that can never be repaired , all while leaving an unbelievable amount of mess behind them for other unfortunate souls to clean at risk of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lethal .\nI know because I \u2019 ve witnessed their threat first hand .\nThis week , I and around two hundred and fifty other women and men of all ages and backgrounds went to an Edinburgh University lecture hall in George Square in the expectation of watching a documentary about women \u2019 s rights .\nA handful of \u201c trans rights activists \u201d showed up and barricaded the doors from the inside , repeating their fascistic little act when we tried to move to Old College .\nMeanwhile , security stood around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the first and second act of Waiting For Godot ( I \u2019 m very much in love with this theme of absurdist theatre metaphors ) .\nTo cut a long and tiresome story short , the film screening was postponed .\nThere were plenty of us and only ten or so of them ( if that ) but numbers are relative when faced with creatures of unhinged anger and destructive tendencies .\nIt would , after all , only take a single rhino to keep an entire neighbourhood of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhinos against a crowd of two hundred and fifty is a no-brainer when all of senior management are also sporting tusks .\nAnd my goodness , populate half of Holyrood with rhinoceroses and it \u2019 s no wonder a country of five million has been bullied into silence and/or complicity .\nScotland is set to become one of the rhinoceros capitals of the world , if it \u2019 s not already .\nOur Supreme Leader Of The Scottish Nation , Nicola Sturgeon has metamorphosed in the last two years from looking unnervingly tusk-y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snorting , bullying specimens of odd-toed ungulate one could imagine on this issue .\nIronically , despite her proud rhinoceros hide , she remains astonishingly thin-skinned , and has successfully overseen the trampling of anyone who has pleaded she listens to reason , from UN experts to fathers of disabled daughters who want to ensure their little girls have only female nurses bathe and change them .\nTomorrow , Sturgeon will preside over one of the most regressive , dangerous and frankly absurd pieces of legislation the modern world has ever seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to get the word \u2018 woman \u2019 redefined from an adult human female to anyone to who has a piece of paper that says they are one .\nShould obtaining this piece of paper involve a rigorous , measured process that takes psychological and criminal history into serious consideration and prioritises the safety of women and children , this would be permissible to the socially liberal .\nAlas though , the new GRA has shamelessly scrapped all safeguarding measures .\nFor a man to legally become a woman now \u2013 and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be it changing rooms or prisons , all he has to do is \u2018 live as \u2019 a woman ( whatever the hell that means ) for three months followed by a three-month \u2018 reflection period \u2019 .\nTRA-adjacent politicians have nowhere to hide with this now .\nThey can no longer deny that sex-based rights will be grievously compromised and that predators and fetishists now have ease of access to women ( and children \u2019 s ) spaces , from bathrooms to sports teams .\nThe only argument \u2013 and I use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint concerned individuals as hysterics : no one \u2019 s going to abuse the system , bigot !\nSo what \u2019 s it to you ?\nLet \u2019 s say for the sake of argument that \u2019 s true ( it \u2019 s not ) , that no predator will use this red carpet policy to harm women or children ( they will , in droves ) , why would you want to vote through legislation that hypothetically enables it regardless ?\nWhy would you risk such serious danger ?\nThe odds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very long but I \u2019 m not going to wave a metal golf club in the air at the sound of thunder .\nAnother stroke of genius in Ionesco \u2019 s choice of the rhinoceros as allegory for blind conformity is the sheer absurdity .\nIt \u2019 s no comedy , yet there \u2019 s a laugh-out-loud element to the idea of this graceless tank of an animal accidentally taking over the world .\nIt would be hard not to giggle in shock if you did see one of these dinosaur-like yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an average Tuesday , and you probably wouldn \u2019 t want to believe the sheer ridiculousness of what you \u2019 d just witnessed , and accept the danger you and others are potentially in now .\nSuch is the knee-jerk disbelief many have to the dangers of self-ID and gender ideology in general .\nNo government , not even Holyrood , would wave through something this horrifically stupid , right ?\nI don \u2019 t know what to tell you except the truth : they have .\nStart panicking .\nMany , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and men I am allied with in this fight for women \u2019 s rights , child safeguarding and reality are middle-aged or elderly .\nThey are motivated by their children , grandchildren or simply a memory of a time when there was some semblance of sanity and adherence to material reality .\nI \u2019 m a little different .\nI \u2019 m 29 now and have not yet had my children .\nYou can \u2019 t call me a reactionary because I came of age in this culture of clownery .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as carve out some hope there might be one worth bringing new people into
