"In his State of the Union address Tuesday , President Joe Biden is expected to unveil a new plan to address surging prices throughout the U.S. economy , part of an effort by the White House to show voters that it is tackling one of their main concerns ahead of what could be a disastrous mid-term election for Democrats this fall .\nThe plan will reportedly include proposals to reduce costs of consumer basics such as prescription drugs and education , promote competition , boost small businesses and strengthen supply chains .\nEven in skeletal form , though , Biden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just what is causing inflation right now .\nMany economists have expressed doubts about the ability of the federal government to reduce inflation by doing things like subsidizing education costs and negotiating drug lower prices \u2013 useful measures , perhaps , but unlikely to move the needle in the short and medium term .\nFor many economists , the cause of the current inflationary trend is simple : too much relief and stimulus spending during the Covid-19 crisis .\nFormer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers is one of the most prominent proponents of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a victory lap as inflation continues to come in hotter than expected .\nThe over-spending argument : Summers warned last year that Congress was running the risk of creating excess inflation by spending too much , too fast on Covid relief .\n\u201c I think the policy is rather overdoing it , \u201d Summers said last May , just a few weeks after Biden signed the $ 1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan into law .\n\u201c We \u2019 re taking very substantial risks on the inflation side.\n\u201d Summers argued that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coronavirus crisis would exceed the level of spending on President Johnson \u2019 s Great Society programs and the Vietnam War \u2013 and many economists blame the latter for sparking the inflation that cropped up in the late 1960s .\n\u201c We are printing money , we are creating government bonds , we are borrowing on unprecedented scales , \u201d Summers said .\n\u201c Those are things that surely create more of a risk of a sharp dollar decline than we had before .\nAnd sharp dollar declines are much more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical.\n\u201d Summers has also been critical of what he sees as excessive accommodation by the Federal Reserve and has expressed doubts about the ability of the Fed to move quickly and decisively to reduce inflationary pressure .\n\u201c There are lots of reasons to suspect the Fed is well behind the curve , \u201d Summers said earlier this month .\n\u201c I suspect next month it will get worse rather than better , \u201d he added , referring to the inflation numbers .\nAnd given the persistence of inflation , Summers is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass another social spending bill , even if it \u2019 s scaled back .\nSummers recently told Bloomberg that the American Rescue Plan was \u201c a serious error \u201d that \u201c both set the stage for the inflation and politics that we have today and it eliminated the chance to make fundamental investments in our country given the political context.\n\u201d The supply chain argument : Not everyone agrees with Summers , even though he appears to have nailed the call on inflation .\nSlate \u2019 s Jordan Weissmann wrote in December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk of short-term inflation , he hedged his bets more than he admits and , perhaps more importantly , he didn \u2019 t really get it right as to why inflation could be expected to run so high .\nFor one thing , the dollar declines Summers warned about never materialized .\nFor another , the overheating Summers was concerned about hasn \u2019 t quite worked out as expected .\n\u201c As far as I know , Summers never really spelled out step by step how he thought inflation would take hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have in mind a standard textbook model , where government spending would swamp the economy with demand and drive unemployment unsustainably low , creating pressure for higher wages and eventually inflation , \u201d Weissmann wrote .\nBut as many economists have noted , the inflation the U.S. has experienced doesn \u2019 t fit the textbook model .\n\u201c Rather , they \u2019 ve resulted from massive , stimulus-fueled consumer demand running smack dab into supply chain problems related to the pandemic , \u201d he said .\n\u201c That \u2019 s really not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive editor David Dayen has recently taken up the supply-chain argument in particular , and in Thursday \u2019 s New York Times lays out the argument that instead of overheating , as Summers predicted , the economy is suffering from structural defects that were put in place under the guidance of neoliberal economists like Summers who encouraged businesses in the 1990s to trade stable and resilient production systems for speed , low prices , and high profits .\n\u201c Democrats put their faith in an economics profession that is far too distant from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globalization , monopolization , financialization , deregulation , and just-in-time logistics , \u201d Dayen writes .\n\u201c They failed to recognize how things could crumble because of the vulnerability they engineered.\n\u201d The irony , in Dayen \u2019 s view , is that one of the main architects of the fast , lean , and now broken supply chain is taking credit for predicting the inflation he helped cause .\n\u201c Larry Summers shares the blame for inflation , \u201d he writes .\n\u201c Mr .\nSummers shouldn \u2019 t be an obstacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bystander , watching it unfold ; he should be an active enthusiast for cleaning up the mess he made .\n\u201d", "author": "mrainey", "url":

future earnings and taxes paid , educational attainment and multiple positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health and longevity for parents .\nThe researchers then compared the cost of providing those benefits to the associated decline in costs of providing things like health care , child protective services , criminal justice and other social welfare programs .\nOverall , the researchers concluded that the benefits of virtually all cash-transfer programs outweigh their costs , by a factor of between five and 10 , depending on the program and the need of the households involved .\nYes , but : The study comes with some important limitations .\nFor one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the variation of effects by income .\nIt \u2019 s likely that a very low-income household will receive far more benefits from $ 1,000 in cash aid than a household closer to the middle class , but the researchers had little insight into different effects for different income groups .\nAnd researchers could not determine how rapidly the positive effects decline as cash transfers increase .\nIt \u2019 s likely that the first $ 1,000 in aid produces more powerful effects than the second or third thousand , but researchers do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly how much .\nA look at Democrats \u2019 child tax credit : The researchers applied their results to the costs and benefits of the proposal backed by the Biden White House to provide a permanent refundable child tax credit , similar to the temporary program included in the American Rescue Plan in 2021 that expired in December .\nIn their analysis , the program , which provides cash benefits of $ 3,600 per child under the age of 6 and $ 3,000 per child between ages 6 and 17 for qualifying households @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per year , while providing about $ 982 billion a year in overall benefits \u2014 \u201c very high net returns for the U.S. population , \u201d the authors write .\nThe largest single component of that benefit comes in terms of the health and longevity of children , which the researchers calculated to be worth $ 424 billion .\nBut even in the more concrete terms of income , the program still produces a net positive , with children \u2019 s future earnings rising by an estimated $ 270 billion .\nPublic health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 billion , while the decline in the overall cost of crime is a substantial $ 208 billion .\nOnce all of the savings and increased expenditures are factored in ( including , for example , higher Social Security spending for beneficiaries who lead longer lives ) , the net savings for taxpayers in terms of direct expenditures comes to $ 135 billion , the researchers said .\n\u201c While this benefit-cost ratio is quite high , it is in the same ballpark as other investments in children such as high-quality pre-k programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d the researchers said .\nBetter child care would provide big benefits , too : A separate report released by The Century Foundation , a liberal think tank , finds that the proposal to subsidize child care services and universal pre-kindergarten included in Democrats \u2019 Build Back Better bill would also provide significant individual and social benefits .\nThe proposed program would pay money to both service providers and directly to parents to expand child care options and make it more affordable for families .\nAlthough the analysis doesn \u2019 t dig into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that improved child care would provide billions in benefits to families , businesses and communities .\nAccording to the analysis , the proposed child care plan would increase overall economic output by about $ 48 billion as more parents are freed up to return to work ; boost business and government tax revenue by $ 60 billion as disruptions caused by child care problems decrease ; and provide a roughly $ 30 billion increase in the economy as child care services and employment expand .\n\u201c The child care and [ universal pre-kindergarten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support children \u2019 s healthy development , family economic security , and gender and racial equity , \u201d say authors Julie Kashen , Julie Cai , Hayley Brown and Shawn Fremstad .\n\u201c This report

budget experts tackled that question Monday at the annual policy conference of the National Association for Business Economics .\nCongressional Budget Office Director Phillip Swagel told the audience that the fiscal effects of inflation on federal revenue and spending largely cancel each other out over the 10-year budget window .\n\u201c The fiscal danger is interest rates , \u201d Swagel said .\nRising rates lead to higher borrowing costs for the government .\n\u201c Higher inflation and higher interest rates over time lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments , \u201d Swagel said .\n\u201c The fiscal challenge , at least the near-term fiscal challenge , of higher inflation is coming through the flow burden of the debt.\n\u201d A recent CBO analysis found that , in a scenario where both inflation and interest rates are much higher than it projects in its baseline forecast , cumulative deficits would be $ 2.3 trillion larger from 2022 through 2031 , but federal debt held by the public as a share of the economy would be a smidge smaller at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly than gross domestic product .\nAnd Swagel noted that net interest payments as a share of GDP remain moderate by historical standards .\nWendy Edelberg , the director of The Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution and a former chief economist at the Congressional Budget Office , said that net interest costs don \u2019 t look set to rise to worrying levels over the next decade .\n\u201c Rising interest rates are baked in to the fiscal outlook and the fiscal outlook , at least over the next decade , to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Edelberg also said that inflationary pressures would shift over the coming year as consumers adjust their spending and pivot away from goods and back to services .\nThat may pose challenges to policymakers looking for historical parallels .\n\u201c It is very likely that over the next year we will at least see some months with outright goods deflation , \u201d Edelberg said , \u201c but at the same time we \u2019 re going to see an extraordinary increase \u2014 I think , I hope \u2014 in demand for services , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressures are , and where we should be

heads the conservative American Action Forum , said that the nation \u2019 s fiscal trajectory and its structural budget problems concern him , especially as they limit our ability to invest in areas

basis , the Bureau of Economic Analysis announced Thursday , in what is the first negative GDP report since the early days of the pandemic two years ago .\nWhile the report shows a sharp contrast with the preceding months , when the U.S. recorded strong growth , most economists are saying the negative results are not a cause for alarm .\n\u201c The report isn \u2019 t as worrisome as it looks , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Beneath the weak headline print , the details point to an economy with solid underlying strength that demonstrated resilience in the face of Omicron , lingering supply constraints and high inflation.\n\u201d Technical factors in play : In remarks at the White House , President Biden blamed \u201c technical factors \u201d for the downbeat numbers , and according to Bloomberg \u2019 s Jordan Fabian and Chris Anstey , he is basically correct .\n\u201c GDP in the first three months of this year was walloped by one of the biggest hits from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Fabian and Anstey write .\n\u201c That \u2019 s because American businesses and consumers bought a lot of foreign products , at a time when most other economies aren \u2019 t buying U.S. goods at the same pace.\n\u201d The increase in purchases of foreign goods is a sign of an extremely hot economy , says Joseph Brusuelas , chief economist at the consulting firm RSM .\n\u201c Despite the 1.4 % contraction , personal consumption up 2.7 % .\nInvestment increases 7.3 % as activity in the real economy remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c To put it bluntly the economy is expanding at such a brisk pace that Americans turned to external sources to meet demand.\n\u201d Inflation takes a bite : Inflation also played a major role in the negative result .\nIn non-inflation-adjusted terms , the economy grew by 1.6 % , indicating that consumers and businesses spent more in the first quarter than the quarter before .\nBut inflation ate away at the real value of those purchases , producing an inflation-adjusted decrease .\n( See the chart below for the big gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) \u201c The growing gap between what economists call \u2018 real \u2019 ( inflation-adjusted ) and \u2018 nominal \u2019 ( unadjusted ) growth reveals a lot about the complicated state of the U.S. economy , \u201d says The New York Times \u2019 Ben Casselman .\n\u201c Demand for just about everything is exceptionally strong : Consumers want cars and houses and meals at restaurants ; companies want workers and materials so they can sell them those things.\n\u201d Politically , though , the fact that inflation is so strong and persistent could prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell ( R-KY ) charged that \u201c runaway inflation is crushing working American families on Democrats \u2019 watch , \u201d adding that his opponents have \u201c thrown the recovery into reverse and we \u2019 re actually going backward.\n\u201d Recession still unlikely \u2013 for now : While a handful of analysts are predicting a recession \u2013 Deutsche Bank this week forecasted a \u201c major recession \u201d in the U.S. next year driven by Federal Reserve tightening \u2013 most say it \u2019 s too early to make any predictions .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the start of a recession , \u201d Ian Shepherdson , chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics , wrote Thursday .\n\u201c The weakness in GDP growth was due to wild components.\n\u201d Gus Faucher , chief economist at PNC , said in a note , \u201c Although GDP fell in the first quarter , the U.S. economy is not in recession .\nUnderlying demand remains strong , and the labor market is in excellent shape.\n\u201d Still , the report did increase worries about the Fed \u2019 s ability to deliver a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down inflation .\n\u201c When the Fed has to raise interest rates as far as they say they \u2019 re going to , recession risks are high , \u201d Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody \u2019 s Analytics , told The Washington Post .\n\u201c There \u2019 s just no graceful way for the economic plane to land on the tarmac .\nIt might land without crashing , but it \u2019 s going to be a scary ride.\n\u201d At the White House , Biden downplayed the threat of a downturn .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recession , \u201d he said .\n\u201c No one is predicting a recession now .\nSome are predicting there may be a recession in 2023.\n\u201d Biden also called on lawmakers to take steps to help head off any burgeoning economic weakness by enacting his agenda .\n\u201c Congress should send to my desk a bipartisan innovation bill to bolster our supply chains and make more in America , \u201d he said .\n\u201c And Congress needs to pass legislation to lower costs and lower the deficit \u2026 \u201d But interest rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c For those who think this data will cause policymakers at the Federal Reserve to hesitate on their plans to push the policy rate well above the terminal rate of 2.5 % by the end of the year , think again , \u201d Brusuelas writes .\n\u201c First-quarter growth data underscores that policy direction and will most likely add to the urgency at the central bank

popularity and are expected to cover a majority of Medicare beneficiaries within just a few years , but according to a report by a federal watchdog released Thursday , the plans have a bad track record of denying needed medical care that should be covered under the terms of the federal insurance program for those 65 and older .\nIn a 61-page report , a team of investigators from the inspector general 's office of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that tens of thousands of seniors with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or faced delays for necessary medical for which they were eligible .\nMedical care frequently involved in the delays and denials includes imaging services such as MRIs and CT scans , as well as stays in rehabilitation facilities \u2013 all of which could jeopardize the health of those who need the prescribed medical care .\n\u201c Although MAOs [ Medicare Advantage Organizations ] approve the vast majority of requests for services and payment , they issue

Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services , which runs Medicare .\nThe analysis : The investigators reviewed a sample of 430 denials issued by 15 large Medicare Advantage insurers in June of 2019 and found that 13 % were made improperly for medical services that should have been approved .\nBased on that rate , the investigators estimate that 85,000 requests were improperly denied that year .\nQuestionable denials are nothing new in Medicare Advantage plans .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of all appeals of denials are overturned , suggesting that insurers are being too aggressive , and The New York Times \u2019 s Reed Abelson says that \u201c hospitals and doctors have long complained about the insurance company tactics \u201d within the program .\nPrivate insurers are paid a flat fee per patient by the federal government and may be motivated to deny services in order to increase profits .\nThe recommendation : About 29 million Americans are covered by Medicare Advantage plans , and the investigators said the program needs more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue new guidelines for insurers to clarify what qualifies as necessary medical services , and to update the audit system to focus on problems revealed in the report .\nStill , some critics say that the problems are unavoidable given the nature of the Medicare Advantage program , which relies on profit-seeking firms to control costs .\nIn a piece at The American Prospect Friday , Ryan Cooper argues that insurers inevitably seek to game the system in the pursuit of profit by doing things likes denying claims and rigging the risk pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher cost .\n\u201c All this ( plus a bunch of other complicated scams ) means that Advantage enrollees receive something like 10 to 25 percent less in health care spending , but

Peterson Foundation and the Comeback America Initiative , as a distinguished visiting professor at the U.S .\nNaval Academy and as a member of the Defense Business Board and various non-profit boards and advisory groups .\nMost recently , I have been working quietly with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fighting for passage of a federal Fiscal Responsibility Amendment ( FRA ) .\nMany Americans do not realize there are two ways to achieve such an amendment under Article V of the Constitution .\nFirst , two-thirds of the House and Senate can propose such an amendment .\nAlternatively , two-thirds of the states ( currently 34 ) can file applications for a convention to propose amendments .\nIf this condition is met , the Constitution states that the Congress shall call for such a convention and set the date and place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-quarters of the states ( currently 38 ) must ratify any proposed amendment for it to become part of the Constitution .\nRecent extensive research of state and federal records discovered that there were 39 active plenary and FRA-specific applications in 1979 and 40 in 1983 and yet Congress never called for a convention of states .\nThere are two reasons for this failure of Congress to discharge its constitutional responsibility .\nFirst , Congress has never assigned the nation \u2019 s archivist the responsibility to receive , retain and count state petitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rather not have a convention of states because lawmakers do not want to lose power and no members would be guaranteed a seat at the convention .\nAfter all , conventions of states happen when the Congress fails to act !\nShockingly , since 1979 , when the Congress first failed to act , total federal debt has risen from less than $ 1 trillion to over $ 30 trillion and the ratio of debt held by the public to GDP is approaching its highest level in history .\nClearly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to ensure that Congress acts in a fiscally responsible and sustainable manner .\nIn addition , the Congressional Budget Office projects that debt held by the public/GDP will exceed 200 % in 2050 absent a change in course .\nAllowing this to happen will threaten our future economic security , national security and domestic tranquility over time .\nGiven the above , I and others are collaborating with selected members of Congress and several states to do four things .\n\u2022 First , introduce legislation that will give the archivist the responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Article V applications , and to notify the Congress when the two-thirds of states requirement is met .\n\u2022 Second , introduce a concurrent resolution that , based on the above referenced accounting of applications , would require Congress to set the date and place for a convention of states unless the archivist certifies that the two-thirds of the states requirement has never been met .\n\u2022 Third , develop a proposed constitutional amendment designed to limit the ratio of total debt held by the public to GDP ( e.g.\n, 125 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable and sustainable level over a specified period of time ( e.g.\n, 90 % by 2035 ) \u2022 Finally , pursue a state-led mandamus case that would eventually be resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court if Congress fails to call for a convention of states or pass its own Fiscal Responsibility Amendment .\nHistory shows that Congress only acts to address major fiscal challenges when one of three things happen .\nFirst , a crisis may force action .\nWe should seek to avoid one .\nSecond , committed presidential leadership willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis .\nWe have not had that since Bill Clinton .\nFinally , when public pressure comes from We the People .\nIn addition to a Fiscal Responsibility Amendment , we will need a statutory Fiscal Sustainability Commission to restore fiscal sanity .\nThat commission must actively engage the American people with the facts and tough choices we face , solicit input on reforms and make a package of recommendations to Congress that will be guaranteed a vote .\nThe stakes for our country \u2019 s and families \u2019 futures are extremely high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act , the time has come for a meaningful public education and engagement effort like prior Fiscal Wake-up and Solutions Tours , including the 2012 $ 10 Million a Minute Tour that was primarily funded by the late H. Ross Perot .\nThe $ 10 Million a Minute Tour covered 10,000 miles and resulted in 77 % to 97 % agreement among representative groups of voters on a series of specific budget , tax , spending and other reforms that would achieve the above objectives .\nThe need is much greater today than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save America \u2019 s future .\nI and others are willing to continue to donate our time to this important effort .\nWho will step up to meet the moment and fund the education and engagement effort ?\nDavid M.

reducing tariffs , progressives , some industry groups and unions \u2014 a key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midterm elections \u2014 oppose the idea .\nThe economics : Economists and others point out that imports from China have not been the main drivers of inflation .\n\u201c The cost of Chinese imports , \u201d the Post \u2019 s Lynch writes , \u201c has increased by 4.6 percent over the past 12 months , well below the overall jump in the cost of living.\n\u201d Analysts also say that the tariffs have failed to achieve their objectives \u2014 the trade deficit with China is on a record pace this year and complaints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut economists also suggest that cutting tariffs may have only a somewhat modest effect on inflation , especially with supply chain disruptions and Chinese factory shutdowns due to Covid-19 still factors .\nAnd any benefit would take time to be fully realized .\nA March study by economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that ending tariffs would reduce the consumer price index measure of inflation by 1.3 percentage points , or $ 797 per household .\nThe index in April was 8.3 % higher than a year earlier .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ might seem small when inflation is raging at more than 7 percent , the relief is not trivial , \u201d the authors wrote .\nAn earlier study also from the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that removing tariffs on Chinese products could lower CPI inflation by about 0.3 percentage points and said that \u201c this one-time drop in the price level would put only a small , short-lived dent in overall inflation.\n\u201d Economist Jason Furman , who led the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama , told The New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the Consumer Price Index by about half a percentage point .\nBut , he says , cutting tariffs is the biggest step Biden could take .\n\u201c It \u2019 s larger than anything the White House or [ Federal Reserve ] could do within six months , \u201d Furman told Politico .\n\u201c It is the biggest tool they have , everything else is quite small compared to it .\nWhy it matters : Biden faces tremendous pressure to bring down inflation , which remains a top concern for voters , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A CBS News poll released Sunday found that 69 % of Americans rate the economy as \u201c very bad \u201d or \u201c fairly bad , \u201d compared with 26 % who call it \u201c very good \u201d or \u201c fairly good.\n\u201d Biden on Monday said in response to a reporter \u2019 s question that a recession is not inevitable , but he again acknowledged Americans \u2019 economic concerns .\n\u201c Now , does that mean we don \u2019 t have problems ?\n\u201d Biden said .\n\u201c We do .\nWe have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has , but less consequential

unveiled a new three-part plan for fighting inflation , kicking off a month-long effort by the White House to focus its public message on the state of the U.S. economy .\nIn an op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal , Biden made the case for his management of the economy so far .\n\u201c In January 2021 , when I took office , the recovery had stalled and Covid was out of control , \u201d he wrote .\n\u201c In less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration \u2019 s economic and vaccination plans helped achieve the most robust recovery in modern history .\nThe job market is the strongest since the post-World War II era , with 8.3 million new jobs , the fastest decline in unemployment on record , and millions of Americans getting jobs with better pay.\n\u201d At the same time , Biden recognized the stubborn persistence of inflation , and said it is now his top economic priority .\nHis plan to fight inflation consists of three main pillars : 1 .\nRecognize that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and avoid interfering with the central bank \u2019 s efforts .\n2 .\nReduce prices and boost the productive capacity of the economy .\nBiden addressed the politically sensitive issue of high fuel prices specifically , saying they are driven by Russia \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine .\nHe highlighted his release of oil from the national strategic reserve to reduce prices and called on Congress to pass tax credits to boost new investments in clean energy .\nHe also called for fixing supply chains , investing in infrastructure , negotiating lower drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nShifting the blame ?\nWhile some

many expressed doubts about how effective the plan would be , and some accused the president of seeking to blame others for problems in the economy .\nHeading into a meeting with Federal Reserve Chair

to nominate highly qualified individuals for that institution but to give them the space they need to do their job .\nI 'm not going to interfere with their critically important work.\n\u201d But by citing the Fed as his first line of defense against inflation , Biden could be seen as shifting some portion of responsibility for the effort to reduce inflationary pressure to the central bank

saying that Biden \u2019 s declaration of support for Fed independence is \u201c simultaneously shifting responsibility for taming decades-high inflation ahead of the November midterms.\n\u201d Politico \u2019 s Ben White highlighted the finger-pointing game that has consumed Washington on inflation .\n\u201c President Joe Biden blames Vladimir Putin , \u201d he wrote late last week

inflation rate to 4 % .\nBefore the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee last month , Fed Chair Jerome Powell was asked several times about the possibility of raising the Fed 's 2 % target .\nThis follows a suggestion from Nobel Laureate economist Paul Romer that the Federal Reserve should raise the target to 3 % or 4 % .\nThis isn \u2019 t a new idea .\nEconomists have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation target for the past decade , and now commentators , such as Matthew Yglesias are starting to promote this idea , too .\nWhile raising the inflation target would allow the government to partially inflate away the Federal debt , the costs of such a policy change would fall on consumers , business owners and workers .\nThose who want to raise the inflation target say doing so would

downturn .\nWhether or not a higher inflation target would reduce the risk of hitting the zero lower bound is a matter of debate .\nA 2020 Federal Reserve Bank of Boston working paper found that raising the inflation target to 4 % would be largely ineffective at preventing the zero lower bound .\nWhat \u2019 s more , arguments for a 4 % target contradict each other .\nIn the years after the Great Financial Crisis , proponents of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reason enough for a higher inflation target .\nToday , the proponents of a 4 % target rate have done a complete 180 \u2014 they now argue that this policy is a solution to \u201c above-target inflation.\n\u201d How can it be that both inflation below 2 % and above 6 % are equal justifications for a higher inflation target ?\nIn fact , raising the target inflation rate to 4 % in order to justify persistent overshooting of the Feds \u2019 2 % average inflation target would likely damage the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isn \u2019 t just the Fed 's credibility that would take a hit \u2014 there are serious economic costs that result from higher trend inflation .\nFor instance , savers and especially retirees would be hit hard by persistent 4 % inflation .\nThe average American reaching retirement age has a little over $ 200,000 in savings .\nWith 4 % inflation , their savings could be cut in half every 18 years , unless they seek riskier investment choices .\nEmpirical studies have examined the welfare costs of raising trend inflation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies find that such a policy change would generate a consumption-equivalent welfare loss of 3.7 % to 6.9 % \u2014 a significant hit to the average consumer .\nMost economists recognize the costs of raising the inflation target .\nA 2017 survey of economists conducted by the University of Chicago 's Booth Review found that over half of economists in the weighted survey believed that raising the inflation target to 4 % would impose long-term costs on households .\nConsumers can expect continually increased prices as the median wage growth for American workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and services .\nOn a similar note , a 2021 study published in the Journal of Money , Credit , and Banking found that higher trend inflation leads to more economic uncertainty and a greater loss of economic output in the long run .\nThe Federal Reserve has spent decades building credibility around its price stability goal of 2 % inflation .\nBy raising the target rate to 4 % , decades of hard work in building credibility around this goal could crumble .\nAs Columbia University economist Frederic Mishkin argues , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price stability is no longer a credible goal of the central bank and then the question arises , if a 4 % level of inflation is OK , then why not 6 % , or 8 % and so on.\n\u201d Since the 1990 \u2019 s , economic consensus has deemed 2 % inflation to be the optimal target .\nThe reason for this has been the cost associated with a higher inflation target .\nCentral banks have focused on targeting inflation to a level where people no longer worry about it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation threshold above 3 % imposes welfare costs .\nInflation targets of industrialized countries all lie between 1 % and 3 % .\nThis reflects the general range of targets consistent with price stability .\nKeeping inflation at around 2 % seems to best align with the Federal Reserve 's mandate to keep inflation low and stable .\nThe empirical literature corroborates the case for keeping the Fed \u2019 s target where it is now and not moving it upward .\nEconomists and Fed officials should be willing to push back against growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nA 4 % target would promote uncertainty and cause economic harm to American consumers ,

Act of 2022 ( working title ) , \u201d Dayen writes .\n\u201c But one of the biggest is that the Trump tax cuts will make it through the first two years of the Biden administration unscathed\u2014and could very well become permanent , a symbol of the one-way ratchet in favor of the top 1 percent that characterizes U.S. policymaking.\n\u201d Dayen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem with the Democratic Party : \u201c If you have unanimous opposition to a bad policy with no real political proponents and then can \u2019 t get a single thing done about it in the space of five years , it speaks to an essential

could slow economic growth , push up interest payments to foreign holders of U.S. debt , heighten the risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likelihood of less abrupt adverse effects , make the U.S. fiscal position more

from the month before , equal to a 5.8 % annual rate .\nThat rate is still below inflation , meaning workers are actually worse off on average , but is still well above what the Fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising the odds that the central bank will deliver another 75-basis-point rate hike in September .\n\u201c The most concerning thing in this report is that we didn \u2019 t see the expected

it was \u201c nice to see this many jobs added but it is scary about what it means for the size of the adjustment we may have coming.\n\u201d The bottom line : Another sizzling job report is good news

has been \u201c a guiding precept \u201d for the IRS as it plans how to spend the additional funding it expects to receive in the coming years , including roughly $ 45 billion designated for

false.\n\u201d The 87,000-person force will not be appearing on the horizon any time soon \u2013 in fact , it is unlikely ever to assemble .\nThe figure is drawn from a year-old Treasury report that

relief on Wednesday , according to multiple reports .\nAlthough details have yet to be confirmed by the White House , the Biden administration is reportedly set to announce that payments on student debt \u2014 which have been suspended multiple times since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic , with the latest pause scheduled to expire on August 31 \u2014 will continue to be suspended for at least another four months , through the end of the year .\nIn addition , the White House may announce that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of student loan debt for those with incomes under a certain threshold , with the administration reportedly leaning toward at least $ 10,000 in debt forgiveness per student loan borrower , limited to those with incomes below $ 125,000 per year .\nAdministration officials and their allies are still debating whether to go ahead with cancellation and , if they do , the amount of debt to be forgiven and the income limits that would apply , The Washington Post \u2019 s Jeff Stein and Danielle Douglas-Gabriel report .\nConcerns about cost and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many mainstream economists oppose the idea of forgiving student debt , due in part to the budgetary cost of doing so and in part to the potential for increasing inflationary pressures in the economy .\nOn Tuesday , the Penn Wharton Budget Model released an analysis of different student debt relief scenarios , and estimated that forgiving $ 10,000 in debt for those earning less than $ 125,000 would cost about $ 330 billion over 10 years , with the vast majority of the cost \u2014 $ 298 billion \u2014 coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount to $ 50,000 per borrower with the same income limit would raise the cost to $ 933 billion over 10 years .\nDiscarding the means testing raises the cost , but not by as much as you might think .\nEliminating up to $ 10,000 per borrower with no income limit would cost $ 344 billion over 10 years , while $ 50,000 in debt forgiveness would cost an estimated $ 979 billion .\nAs far as inflation is concerned , some economists argue that , in addition to having a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation worse by freeing up spending money among debtors .\n\u201c The Inflation Reduction Act saves maybe $ 300 billion dollars in the first 10 years .\nIf we cancel $ 10,000 of debt and just extend the pause a few months , we 're going to be at about that much in terms of new cost , '' Marc Goldwein of the fiscally conservative Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget told CNN .\n\u201c All the deficit reduction will be wiped out .\nAt the same time , we 're probably going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt cancellation than any inflation reduction from the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\u201d Advocates push back : Although establishment economists seem fairly united in their opposition to broad student debt forgiveness , the idea has plenty of supporters on the left \u2014 some of whom argue that debt forgiveness will not increase inflation and could be economically beneficial , as well .\nEconomist Heidi Shierholz of the liberal Economic Policy Institute recently argued that forgiving student debt can \u2019 t increase pricing pressures since loan payments have been suspended for more than two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending their loan payments on other things have already occurred .\nAnd if the administration relies on means testing to limit debt forgiveness , loan payments will resume for those who earn too much to qualify , potentially proving a modest deflationary effect .\nAccording to economists Mike Konczal and Al\u00ed Bustamante of the liberal Roosevelt Institute , canceling student debt will have little effect on inflation because much of the money will be saved by debtors rather than spent .\n\u201c Student debt cancellation will increase people \u2019 s wealth , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period in which people are building up strong economic buffers .\n\u2026 as the Fed \u2019 s annual Survey of Household Economic Decisionmaking found , 2021 saw an increase in households that had a three-month emergency fund across the income distribution .\nThese are positive developments that will dull any new spending impact from debt cancellation.\n\u201d In any event , whether inflationary or not , the effects on the price level are quite small in most analyses .\n\u201c Am I missing something or are all the projections of the inflationary impacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- both from proponents & critics -- very small in either direction ?\n\u201d the Post \u2019 s Jeff Stein asked on Twitter .\nQuestions of fairness : In addition to all the questions about potential economic and fiscal effects , for many people , the issue boils down to a matter of fairness .\nSome of those who have already paid off their loans argue that across-the-board forgiveness is unfair , since they worked so hard to clear their own debts .\nAnd those who never went to college for financial reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges , make a similar point .\nBut fairness arguments cut both ways .\nSome of those who are saddled with student loans say that holding people responsible for often poorly informed decisions they made as teenagers is both unfair and economically harmful , as years of student loan payments limit their ability to save and establish their own independent households .\nOn Wednesday , we expect to see which way the Biden administration decides to go on the

quarter century , and an expanded social safety net has played a leading role in the remarkable decline , according to a comprehensive new analysis of trends since 1993 .\nThe decline may come as a surprise to some since it runs counter to the idea that the American safety net is too weak to keep millions of people out of poverty .\nBut the numbers \u2013 which come from a joint study by The New York Times and Child Trends , a social science research group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c In 1993 , the initial year of this decline , more than one in four children in the United States lived in families

Trends analysis says .\n\u201c Twenty-six years later , roughly one in 10 children lived in families whose economic resources were below the threshold .\nThis is an astounding decline in the child poverty rate , which has seen child poverty reduced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were 19.4 million children in poverty in 1993 , accounting for about 28 % of all children in the U.S. By 2019 , that number had fallen to 8.4 million , or about 11 % of all children .\n( The analysis does not include data from 2020 because of the distorting effects of the large but temporary relief spending amid the Covid-19 pandemic ; with that data , the drop in child poverty is even larger . )\nIf rates had held steady instead of declining since the early 1990s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be living in poverty .\nThe decline has occurred in every state , among every racial group , and in every kind of household , including single-parent families .\nAt the same time , however , key differences remain , especially along racial lines , with Black and Latino children three times as likely to be in poverty as White ones .\nLooking at the causes : The analysis found that multiple factors played a role in the decline of child poverty since the early 1990s , including a decrease in unemployment levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for single mothers , and increased minimum wages at the state level ( though not at the federal level , where the value of the minimum wage fell ) .\nThe biggest factor , though , has been how government aid works .\n\u201c A patchwork of programs shaped by a century of political conflict and compromise

Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more rules requiring beneficiaries to work .\nMost Democrats want higher benefits for more people , as seen in their unsuccessful push this year to permanently turn the child tax credit , a workers \u2019 subsidy , into a broader income guarantee.\n\u201d The safety net for children has been shaped by both impulses .\nMore low-income parents went to work after the reforms enacted during the administration of President Bill Clinton , who promised to \u201c end welfare as we know it.\n\u201d But more aid has been provided , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax credits and nutritional assistance rising sharply .\nAccording to the analysis , safety net programs cut child poverty by 9 % in 1993 .\nBy 2019 , those programs were responsible for a 44 % decrease in child poverty \u2013 a huge increase in effectiveness .\nThe top programs for reducing child poverty were the earned income tax credit , Social Security , food stamps , housing assistance and free and discounted student lunches .\n\u201c The safety net is often criticized for being a patchwork of programs , but that \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomson , a co-author of the Child Trends study , told the Times .\n\u201c It reaches a variety of people in a variety of circumstances.\n\u201d The bottom line : Though the causes are complex , child poverty in the U.S. has dropped dramatically over 25 years , in large part thanks to federal aid programs .\nFormer President Ronald Reagan once famously said , \u201c The federal government declared war on poverty , and poverty won.\n\u201d According to this

The pandemic is over , \u201d Biden replied .\n\u201c We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're still doing a lot of work on it .\nIt 's -- but the pandemic is over.\n\u201d What his administration says : Those comments reportedly surprised some administration officials and come less than two weeks after the White House \u2019 s own Covid-19 response coordinator told reporters that \u201c the pandemic isn \u2019 t over \u201d as he laid out plans for a fall campaign to have Americans get updated vaccines and discussed annual shots going forward .\n\u201c We will remain vigilant , and of course , we

Secretary Xavier Becerra told Yahoo Finance that Biden is correct and was reflecting what many Americans feel , adding that vaccines are still needed .\nWhat the numbers say : The seven-day average of new cases has fallen by nearly 30 % over the past two weeks , dropping to the lowest level since early May , according to data from The New York Times \u2014 yet there are still nearly 62,000 new cases being reported daily , and that official number massively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it does not include people who are testing at home .\nMore than 450 people are still dying from Covid-19 each day

put Biden in a political bind , requiring him to choose between vetoing the tax cuts \u2014 giving the GOP an attack line in the 2024 presidential election \u2014 or allowing Republicans to win on one

that Republicans are selling out the middle class and \u201c doubling down on their 2017 tax giveaway to the ultrawealthy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the point from analysts , too .\n\u201c The Republicans did not want to look like they were giving too much away to businesses , so they had some of the business relief expire and had some offset by business tax increases , \u201d Steve Rosenthal , a policy analyst at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center , told Stein .\n\u201c Now to come back and extend business relief and reverse the increases would mean further tilting our tax system toward the

economy , pointing to a plunging federal budget deficit for fiscal year 2022 and warning that Republicans would reverse the fiscal gains and could \u201c crash the economy next year \u201d if they win control of the House .\nThe Treasury Department said Friday that the full-year deficit for 2022 totaled about $ 1.4 trillion , about half of the $ 2.8 trillion shortfall last year ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touted the decline as the largest one-year drop in American history .\n\u201c Today we have further proof that we \u2019 re rebuilding the economy in a responsible way , \u201d he said .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going from historically strong economic recovery to a steady and stable growth while reducing the deficit.\n\u201d He then tore into Republicans ahead of the November election , arguing that the previous administration drove up the deficit each year and that GOP lawmakers will wreck the economy , take an axe to Social Security and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices if given the chance .\n\u201c Congressional Republicans love to call Democrats big spenders , and they always claim to be for less federal spending , \u201d Biden said .\n\u201c But let \u2019 s look at the facts .\nThe federal deficit went up every single year in the Trump administration , every single year he was president .\nIt went up before the pandemic .\nIt went up during the pandemic .\nIt went up every single year on his watch , the Republican watch.\n\u201d Biden slammed Republicans for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , repeal Democrats \u2019 corporate minimum tax of 15 % and reverse a cost-saving measure allowing Medicare to negotiate some prescription drug prices .\n\u201c Put it all together and the Republican plan would add about $ 3 trillion to the deficit \u2014 $ 3 trillion , \u201d Biden said .\n\u201c Adding another $ 3 trillion to the deficit is reckless , it \u2019 s irresponsible , and it would make inflation worse.\n\u201d Biden , continuing an effort to make Social Security a key issue in the election , also warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s debt limit to force spending cuts .\nA number of Republicans , including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R-CA ) have indicated that they \u2019 ll try to extract concessions from Biden , potentially including changes to entitlement programs , in exchange for raising the debt ceiling .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re worried about the economy , you need to know this : The Republican leadership in Congress has made it clear they will crash the economy next year by threatening the full faith and credit of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , putting the United States in default unless we yield to their demand to cut Social Security and Medicare , \u201d Biden said .\n\u201c Let me be really clear : I will not yield .\nI will not cut Social Security .\nI will not cut Medicare , no matter how hard they work at it.\n\u201d Republicans say their proposed changes are meant to ensure the long-term solvency of both Social Security and Medicare .\nBiden often says he wants voters to compare him to the alternative , not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks Friday sought to frame the midterm elections as a choice rather than a referendum on his record .\n\u201c Its mega MAGA trickle-down , \u201d Biden said of the GOP agenda .\n\u201c The kind of policies that have failed the country before and will fail it again .\nIt \u2019 ll mean more wealth to the very wealthy , higher inflation for the middle class .\nThat 's the choice we 're facing.\n\u201d What \u2019 s really behind the record deficit drop : While Biden sought to claim credit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decline \u2014 from $ 2.776 trillion last year to $ 1.375 trillion this year , to be a bit more precise \u2014 was driven entirely by the expiration of temporary emergency pandemic spending programs .\nTax revenues jumped 21 % from a year ago , and spending fell 8 % .\nYet an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget , a nonpartisan group that advocates for deficit reduction , found that more than 100 % of the decline in the deficit was due to shrinking or expiring Covid relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s claims to fiscal responsibility , saying that the president \u2019 s actions while in office have added increased deficits by $ 4.8 trillion through 2031 .\n\u201c The budget figures released Friday by the Treasury Department reveal dueling visions about what it means to be financially responsible , \u201d notes Josh Boak of the Associated Press .\n\u201c Biden can rightly claim that the budget deficit for fiscal 2022 plunged $ 1.4 trillion from the prior year ; critics can use the same report to say that forgiving education loans pushed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion as the government booked the full expense.\n\u201d The bottom line : While the drop in the deficit may be historic , the $ 1.4 trillion budget gap remains historically huge .\nAnd the election outlook as of now suggests plenty of high-stakes fiscal fights ahead in 2023 .\n\u201c What I \u2019 ve been telling congressional leaders is the most important thing is to cut spending as much as possible , \u201d conservative economist Stephen Moore told The Washington Post .\n\u201c The new deadly

plan her government announced last month , which proposed to slash taxes for top earners and corporations without paying for it \u2014 a full-fledged embrace of trickle-down economics that was a ) politically tone deaf at a time when Britons were struggling to cope with high inflation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcefully rejected by markets , which tanked the value of the British pound and drove

yesterday .\nBut the damage had been done and chaos continued to swirl around her government and her Conservative Party .\nTruss ultimately could not recover the confidence and credibility that had been lost , dooming her tenure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of lettuce .\nEchoes across the sea : The fiscal program laid out by Truss is a familiar one : cut taxes for the rich and wait for economic growth to take off , with the benefits eventually trickling down to the mass of ordinary citizens .\nIt \u2019 s basically the same ideology that has animated Republican fiscal policy in the U.S. for at least four decades , and more than one conservative economist in the U.S. applauded the Truss plan .\nCalling it \u201c perfectly sensible \u201d and \u201c actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Enterprise Institute argued that Truss \u2019 s plan to cut taxes and regulations would boost productivity , investment and growth , though he did disagree with some of the details of her approach .\nLarry Kudlow , who led the National Economic Council in the Trump Administration , was more straightforwardly enthusiastic and pointed to the similarity between the Truss plan and the latest Republican proposals .\n\u201c The new British prime minister , Liz Truss , has laid out a terrific supply-side economic growth plan , which looks a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Commitment to America plan , \u201d he said on Fox News .\nSome Truss critics , though , argue that her shambolic time in office has severely damaged the cause of supply-side economics .\nAs Jonathan Freedland of The Guardian wrote Thursday : \u201c Truss may well have killed off an ideological project that has animated sections of the right , in Britain and across the democratic world , for the best part of half a century .\nThe vision was of a low tax , low regulation society where the richest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make themselves even richer .\n\u201c According to this vision \u2013 whether you call it Hayekism , ultra-Thatcherism , Reaganism or economic libertarianism \u2013 when the fortunate few at the top soar ever upwards , some of their wealth trickles down to those at the bottom .\nVersions of it have held sway at different periods in Britain , the United States and beyond .\n\u201c Now , though , such dreams will be branded as Trussonomics \u2013 and that label will be the kiss of death .\nIn six short weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps for ever.\n\u201d A more sober lesson : Though the Truss debacle may provide plenty of ammunition for critics of old fashioned supply-side economics , some policymakers are taking a different lesson from the event : There are limits to fiscal planning that can not be ignored , and those limits are imposed in large part by the global economy .\nJonathan Portes of Kings College London told The New York Times \u2019 s Mark Landler that the Truss plan simply wouldn \u2019 t work given current economic conditions .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal policy at the wrong time \u2014 borrowing when rates were rising rather than , as in 2010s , when they were low , \u201d Portes said .\nLandler adds that Truss \u2019 s \u201c fatal miscalculation \u2026 was to believe that Britain could defy the gravity of the markets by passing sweeping tax cuts , without corresponding spending cuts , at a time when inflation is running in double digits and interest rates were rising.\n\u201d Once the dust settles , it \u2019 s likely that Great Britain will return to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could still please many conservatives .\n\u201c Virtually all the government \u2019 s planned tax cuts have been reversed , and the next prime minister , regardless of his or her politics , will have little choice but to pursue a policy of spending cuts and strict fiscal discipline , \u201d Landler writes .\n\u201c Some fear a return to the bleak austerity of Prime Minister David Cameron in the years after the 2008 financial crisis .\n\u201d", "author": "mrainey",

inflation : He and his fellow Democrats are working to bring down costs for families ; Republicans will make things worse if they win .\nBiden was at it again on Wednesday , touting falling gas prices , a change that allows hearing aids to be sold over the counter , and a program that provides discounted or free broadband internet service to millions of Americans .\nBiden also announced new actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d such as surprise bank overdraft charges , some credit card late fees and hidden hotel booking costs .\nThe White House cited estimates that found that credit card late payment fees generated $ 12 billion in revenue for companies in 2020 , while bank overdraft fees totaled about $ 15.5 billion as of 2019 and hotel resort fees came to nearly $ 3 billion in 2018 .\nBaggage

Republicans \u2019 economic agenda : \u201c Folks , there are two very different ways of looking at our country .\nOne is , as I \u2019 ve said before , the view from Park Avenue , which says help the wealthy and maybe that \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country .\nThe other is from Scranton or Claymont or thousands of cities across the country like the place I grew up .\nThe benefit and the belief that the backbone of America are people who get up every morning and work for a living , put on their shoes , get out of bed , and go to work .\nThe middle class .\nThey \u2019 re the ones who built this country .\nThat \u2019 s who our economy should work for.\n\u201d Biden has been warning that Republicans \u2019 approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail again .\n\u201c The Republicans have made it clear that if they win control of the Congress , they will shut down the government , refuse to pay our bills , and it \u2019 ll be the first time in our history America will default \u2014 unless I yield and cut Social Security and Medicare , \u201d Biden said in a speech Monday .\n\u201c There \u2019 s nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 that will create more chaos , more inflation and more damage to the American economy than this.\n\u201d Administration economists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new minimum corporate tax and extend some 2017 business tax cuts could add $ 90 billion to the deficit next year .\nDemocratic attacks may be getting sharper , but the fundamental message is one that Biden has been repeating for some time now .\n\u201c Biden \u2019 s new tone reflects the success Republican candidates have found in blaming the president and his party for the high price of food and gas , as well as for perceived increases in crime and immigration , \u201d The Washington Post \u2019 s Toluse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden \u2019 s attacks have grown fiercer as the election has drawn nearer , the strategy of calling out Republican economic plans traces back several months to this spring , when Biden seized on the release of an 11-point policy document by Republican Sen.

happen in theory may be taking a backseat to concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPolls indicate that Americans trust Republicans more on the economy and inflation .\nAnd Republicans have been mounting economic attacks of their own , stoking anger about inflation and fear about Biden \u2019 s agenda .\n\u201c They have pledged to reduce government spending and to make permanent parts of the 2017 Republican tax cuts that are set to expire over the next three years \u2014 including incentives for corporate investment and tax reductions for individuals , \u201d note Jim Tankersley and Emily Cochrane at The New York Times .\n\u201c And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax increases that Mr. Biden signed into law in August while gutting funding for the Internal Revenue Service , which was given more money to help the United States go after high-earning and corporate tax cheats.\n\u201d While Republicans promise to cut inflationary federal spending , Tankersley and Cochrane report that few economists think that the GOP \u2019 s economic agenda will do much to reduce near-term price increases .\n\u201c Instead , \u201d they write , \u201c many say some of what Republicans are proposing \u2014 including tax cuts for high earners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressures worse by pumping more money into the economy.\n\u201d The magnitude of short-term federal spending cuts needed to have an effect on inflation would cause pain throughout the economy .\n\u201c The amount of cuts you \u2019 d have to do to move the needle on inflation are completely off the table , \u201d Jon Lieber , a managing director at the Eurasia Group and former aide to Republican Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , told the Times .\nThe bottom line : The Republican agenda may not do much to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his policies \u2014 and their

Republicans are fiscally reckless pushing tax cuts for the very wealthy that are n't paid for , \u201d Biden charged , referring to reports that GOP lawmakers plan to push for an extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts .\nThe president also pushed back against the way his opponents portray his party .\n\u201c Republicans love calling Democrats big spenders and claim that they are for less government spending , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Well , give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the facts .\nThe federal deficit went up every single solitary year in the Trump administration , went up every year , and went up before the pandemic and went up during the pandemic and went up every single year on his watch .\nAnd one big reason for that is that they voted for a $ 2 trillion Trump tax cut which overwhelmingly benefited the biggest corporations and the wealthiest Americans , and it racked up significant debt and not a penny was paid for.\n\u201d The president highlighted the reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2022 \u2013 the largest one-year drop in U.S. history , driven almost entirely by the expiration of Covid-related relief spending .\n\u201c The deficit fell by $ 1.4 trillion dollars this year , cut the

least the House , some GOP lawmakers are planning their approach to fiscal issues \u2013 an approach that could involve attempts to cut federal spending , using the debt ceiling as leverage .\nHouse

and Medicare , but other Republicans in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just that .\nRep. Chip Roy ( R-TX ) , a member of both the Freedom Caucus and the Republican Study Committee , told Politico that he wants to use whatever opportunity Republicans have to fight for spending cuts .\n\u201c You have two simple leverage points : when government funding comes up and when the debt ceiling is debated , \u201d Roy said .\n\u201c And the only question that matters is , will leadership use that leverage ?\n\u201d Rep.

argues that a windfall profits tax will only decrease domestic production .\n\u201c Rather than taking credit for price declines and shifting blame for price increases , the Biden administration should get serious about addressing the supply and demand imbalance that has caused higher gas prices and created long-term energy challenges , \u201d American Petroleum Institute CEO Mike Sommers said in a statement .\n\u201c Oil companies do not set prices\u2014global commodities markets do .\nIncreasing taxes on American energy discourages investment in new production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is

in the U.S. about our industry returning some of our profits directly to the American people , \u201d Woods said , according to Bloomberg News .\n\u201c That \u2019 s exactly what we \u2019 re doing

families.\n\u201d Gas prices have been drifting lower and now average $ 3.76 a gallon , down about four cents from a month ago but up 36 cents from a year ago , according to AAA .\nWhy it matters : With a week to go before Election Day , Biden and Democrats remain eager to demonstrate that they are working to address the high inflation that voters say in a top concern .\nBut a windfall profits tax \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 would be extremely difficult to implement even if the president \u2019 s party retains control of Congress .\n\u201c Biden set out a promise that will be all but impossible to deliver , \u201d Bloomberg \u2019 s Akayla Gardner , Jennifer A Dlouhy and Kevin Crowley write .\n\u201c Many Democrats have unsuccessfully sought a so-called windfall profit tax for more than a decade .\nNo such proposal is likely to pass the current Senate , evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans , and unless Biden \u2019 s party makes unexpected gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @
