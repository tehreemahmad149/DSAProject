, yet most physicians know little about it .\nIn fact , most dismiss it as useless while their patients firmly believe in its healing properties\u2026The usual tendency of most physicians and nurses is to dismiss as useless any popular remedy that can be purchased without a prescription .\nHowever , the aloe plant deserves a closer look because , surprising as it may seem , there may be a scientific basis for some of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , been used medicinally for thousands of years by a number of ancient civilizations , but only recently has it been put it to the test , as I discuss in my video Is Aloe Effective for Blood Pressure , Inflammatory Bowel , Wound Healing , and Burns ?\n.\nWhat type of tests , though ?\nOnes that investigate whether aloe can ameliorate damage to albino rat testicles or affect the cholesterol and estrogen responses in juvenile goldfish ?\nIndeed , if you inject aloe into the bloodstream of rats , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed it to humans , it doesn \u2019 t appear to have any blood pressure\u2013lowering effect .\nDrinking aloe causes colorectal tumors to form in rats , whereas it appears to have anti-inflammatory effects on human intestinal lining in a petri dish .\nBut , when put to the test for irritable bowel syndrome ( IBD ) , no benefit was found for improving symptoms or improving quality of life in IBS patients .\nAnd , no benefit was found for IBD either .\nWhat about the beneficial effects of aloe in wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so miraculous as to seem more like myth than fact.\n\u201d It works when you slice open guinea pigs or try to frostbite-off the ears of bunny rabbits , as you can see at 1:49 in my video ( though , be warned about graphic images ) , but in people , it may make things worse .\nIndeed , \u201c aloe vera\u2026is associated with a delay in wound healing.\n\u201d Researchers studied 21 women who had wound complications after having a cesarean or other abdominal surgery .\nHealing on their own took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wounds treated with aloe vera gel required 83 days , taking 50 percent longer .\nResearchers thought the aloe would help , based on the animal studies , but when it was put to the test with people , it failed .\nAt this point in my research , it was looking like the only benefit of aloe was to improve the quality of cheap beef burgers , as one study found .\nBut what about burns ?\nAloe has been used to treat burns since antiquity , but , in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feces to burns , so I wouldn \u2019 t put too much faith in ancient medical traditions .\nThat \u2019 s why we have science .\nWhat is the effectiveness of aloe vera gel compared with silver sulphadiazine as burn wound dressing in second-degree burns ?\n\u201c The introduction of topical antimicrobial agents has resulted in a significant reduction in burn mortality to date.\n\u201d Silver sulfadiazine is the most commonly used , but , unfortunately , it may delay wound healing and become toxic to the kidneys and bone marrow .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloe gel .\nThe result ?\nThe burns treated with aloe healed 50 percent faster , and the pain went away about 30 percent faster .\nThe researchers concluded that aloe has \u201c remarkable efficacy \u201d in the treatment of burn injuries .\nAnyone see the flaw in that logic ?\nWhat was this study missing ?\nA placebo control group .\nWhy would that matter ?\nRemember , one of the side effects of the silver sulphadiazine is delayed wound healing .\nSo , maybe the aloe worked better just because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wouldn \u2019 t have worked better than nothing at all .\nWhen it was put to the test against nothing\u2014aloe vera in Vaseline versus the Vaseline alone\u2014the aloe really did seem to help , speeding up healing by about a third .\nAnd , indeed , if you put all the studies together , aloe vera does appear to significantly speed up the healing of second-degree burns .\nBlistering burns , however , are thankfully less common than burns like sunburns , where your skin just turns red .\nWhat is the efficacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment of sunburn ?\nAn aloe vera cream was applied to study subjects 30 minutes before , immediately after , or both before and after they were burned with a UV lamp .\nSurprisingly , the \u201c results showed that the aloe vera cream has no sunburn or suntan protection and no efficacy in sunburn treatment when compared to placebo.\n\u201d It at least works for blistering burns , though , so should we keep some aloe vera gel in the medicine cabinet ?\nThe problem is that aloe vera you buy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vera at all .\nThe product labels may say aloe vera is the first or second ingredient , but manufacturers apparently can be lying .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are , \u201d which means suppliers are on an honor system\u2014but when health and nutrition are mixed with profit , honor , too often , goes out the window .\n\u2022

.\nThose in the apple group knew they were eating an apple , so there may have been an expectation bias\u2014a placebo effect\u2014that made them unconsciously give that extra bit of effort in the

double-blind , placebo-controlled study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements and the other half get a sugar pill , and you don \u2019 t know until the end who got which .\nThe problem there , however , is that you \u2019 re no longer dealing with a whole food , removing the symphony of interactions between the thousands of phytonutrients in the whole apple .\nMost of those special nutrients are concentrated in

"If even light drinking can cause cancer , why don \u2019 t doctors warn their patients about it ?\nAs I discuss in my video Can Alcohol Cause Cancer ?\n, we \u2019 ve known about \u201c the possible association of the consumption of alcohol with excessive mortality from cancer \u201d for more than a hundred years .\nThough there is \u201c accumulating evidence that alcohol drinking is associated with\u2026pancreas and prostate cancer and melanoma , \u201d we \u2019 re pretty certain it \u201c increases the risk of cancer of oral cavity [ mouth ] and pharynx [ throat ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larynx [ voice box ] and female breast.\n\u201d Current estimates suggest alcohol causes about 5.8 percent of all cancer deaths in these organs worldwide .\nHow does it break down for men and women ?\nAs you can see at 0:44 in my video , alcohol causes mostly head , neck , and gastrointestinal cancers in men , whereas it causes mostly breast cancer in women .\nIn fact , alcohol appears to cause more than 100,000 cases of breast cancer every year .\nIs that just among heavy drinkers , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence showed a risk relationship between alcohol consumption and the risk of breast cancer , even at low levels of consumption.\n\u201d Eating a healthy diet , however , may help modulate that risk .\nThough alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer , \u201c a fiber-rich diet has the opposite effect , \u201d so eating more whole plant foods may be able to \u201c ease the adverse effects associated with alcohol consumption.\n\u201d As well , \u201c alcohol has been shown to increase sex hormone levels , \u201d like estrogen , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite effect is seen when eating fiber-rich foods .\n\u201c Fiber may bind estrogen in the colon thus increasing the fecal excretion of estrogens \u201d \u2014that is , help flush them out of the body .\nEven so , there does not appear to be any level of alcohol consumption that is completely safe from a cancer standpoint .\nThis is why we see commentaries in the medical literature suggesting \u201c consumption of alcohol , an addictive carcinogen , can not be considered a healthy lifestyle choice !\n\u201d \u201c Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be clear : It is toxic , carcinogenic , teratogenic [ birth defect\u2013causing ] , and potentially addictive .\nBy arguing otherwise , scientists can give the alcohol lobby and advertisers the opportunity to manipulate scientific evidence to generate profits \u201d over public health .\nThey do this by denying and distorting the evidence , while trying to distract the public \u2019 s attention .\nThe alcohol industry , Big Booze , \u201c appears to be engaged in the extensive misrepresentation of evidence about the alcohol-related risk of cancer , \u201d activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tobacco industry , \u201d Big Tobacco .\nThese industries are somehow able to maintain an illusion of righteousness .\n\u201c Alcohol and tobacco companies ( like their junk food counterparts ) increasingly seek to present themselves\u2026as objective providers of health information about their products , and appropriate sources of educational resources for both adults and children\u2026Health information and messages should come from health authorities , not the 21st century \u2019 s most successful drug peddlers.\n\u201d \u201c Alcohol industries profit hugely from this disconnect and sometimes even appropriate the respectable cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carcinogenic product .\nCase in point : Mike \u2019 s Hard Pink Lemonade .\n\u201c Join the Fight \u201d and \u201c Drink Pink \u201d are emblazoned on the six-pack , along with the pink breast cancer ribbon icon .\nMore like \u201c drink pink carcinogens !\n\u201d \u201c Mike \u2019 s Hard Lemonade ( Mark Anthony Group ) associated the creation of its Limited Edition Hard Pink Lemonade with the death of one of its employees from breast cancer.\n\u201d In doing so , \u201c ironically , it contributes to risk in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KFC \u2019 s \u201c Buckets for the Cure \u201d campaign .\nIf you don \u2019 t remember it , see for yourself at 3:21 in my video .\nCancer risk is one of the \u201c things the alcohol industry won \u2019 t tell you , \u201d but why doesn \u2019 t your doctor tell you ?\nThere is relatively little public awareness of the link , and the medical community remains largely silent .\nThe medical profession may be getting more hip to corporate conflicts of interest in general , but \u201c why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d \u201c Why is alcohol cancer \u2019 s best-kept secret ?\n\u201d Maybe it \u2019 s because the doctors are drinkers themselves and want to remain in \u201c denial\u2026that alcohol causes cancer.\n\u201d Not only do most doctors drink , but a significant proportion admits to drinking while on call and encountering fellow physicians \u201c whom they suspected were impaired by alcohol while on call.\n\u201d Even though most doctors felt they \u201c have an obligation to tell their patients that they use alcohol while on call , only 12 % reported that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call.\n\u201d The industry \u201c has identified the alcohol-causes-cancer message as a considerable threat .\nThese powerful entities have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo of relative ignorance , uncertainty and denial among the general population and their trusted health advisers .\nIn the face of this , it is time that health professionals set aside any leanings that might stem from their own drinking\u2014good or bad\u2014and convey unreservedly to their patients and the communities they serve that alcohol-causes-cancer.\n\u201d Cancer is only our second highest killer .\nThe top killer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French paradox ?\nDoesn \u2019 t moderate drinking protect against cardiovascular disease ?\nIn that case , isn \u2019 t some alcohol beneficial overall ?\nThese are exactly the kinds of questions I set out to

cancers in men and breast cancer in women , even at low levels of intake .\n\u2022 Breast cancer risk is increased by alcohol consumption , which also elevates levels of sex hormones , such as estrogen , but fiber-rich diets have the opposite effect , so greater intake of whole plant foods may \u201c ease the adverse effects associated with alcohol consumption.\n\u201d \u2022 Within the medical literature , commentaries condemn alcohol as \u201c toxic , carcinogenic , teratogenic [ birth defect\u2013causing ] , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol industry has been accused of engaging in \u201c extensive misrepresentation of evidence about the alcohol-related risk of cancer \u201d and participating in activities that \u201c have parallels with those of the tobacco industry.\n\u201d \u2022 Big Booze has even appropriated cancer prevention causes in its marketing\u2014e.g.\n, Mike \u2019 s Hard Pink Lemonade with \u201c Join the Fight \u201d and \u201c Drink Pink \u201d emblazoned on the

drink themselves and a significant proportion admits to imbibing while on call .\nI previously explore breast cancer specifically in my videos Breast Cancer and Alcohol : How Much Is Safe ?\nand

the \u201c systematic error \u201d of misclassifying former drinkers as if they were lifelong abstainers from studies on alcohol and mortality , moderate alcohol consumption , like a glass of wine a day , does not appear to be protective after all .\n\u201c The immediate implication from this [ new research ] is that clinicians need to be highly skeptical about the hypothesized health benefits of alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drink to improve their life expectancy .\nThis is especially important given increasing awareness of cancer risks from even moderate alcohol use.\n\u201d Given the cancer risk from drinking , as I discuss in my video Do Any Benefits of Alcohol Outweigh the Risks ?\n, if there are only harms without any benefits , then the ideal alcohol intake on a routine , day-to-day basis should really be zero , potentially making it a red-light beverage .\nThe problem was that many of these population studies classified those who \u201c quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nondrinkers .\nThis is the problem of reverse causation : Instead of abstaining from alcohol consumption leading to poor health , poor health may have led to abstaining .\nIt \u2019 s similar to studies showing that those who sit around and watch TV have worse health .\nIs watching more TV leading to illness , or is illness leading to more TV ?\nAs you can see at 1:24 in my video , this is one of the reasons why , if you look at the hierarchy of evidence , where stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interventional trials , such as randomized controlled trials , tend to offer better evidence than observational studies of populations , which can suffer from both reverse causation and confounding factors .\nAs a group , light-to-moderate drinkers \u201c display a range of healthy behaviours , such as better diet and more physical activity , \u201d so , for example , they may be more likely to drink their glass of wine with a salad than a cheeseburger , and that \u2019 s why the wine appeared protective .\nIt can be hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For instance , you can \u2019 t randomize people to smoke a pack a day for a few decades , so you sometimes have to base your decisions on observational studies .\nWe now have a new tool , however : Mendelian randomization .\nIn cases where randomized controlled trials \u201c are not feasible or practical , \u201d this new tool \u201c can provide reliable evidence on the causal relationship between exposures and risks of disease.\n\u201d It \u2019 s like the HDL story .\nAlcohol does raise your \u201c good \u201d HDL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems good cholesterol isn \u2019 t any good at lowering heart disease risk after all , based in part on Mendelian randomization studies where people who were randomly assigned higher HDL levels genetically from birth don \u2019 t appear to be protected .\nIs there any way to study people who were randomly assigned since conception not to drink as much ?\nRemarkably , yes .\nAs you can see at 2:46 in my video , alcohol is detoxified in the liver to carbon dioxide and water by two enzymes , ADH1B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , acetaldehyde , a toxic intermediate metabolite , is produced , which can cause unpleasant nausea and flushing sensations .\nIf people are born with a superfast variant of the enzyme ADH1B or a slow variant of the enzyme ALDH2 , toxic acetaldehyde can build up , making drinking alcohol a relatively unpleasant experience throughout their lives .\nSo , they are born less likely to drink as much .\nDo they have an increased risk of heart disease , as the original observational studies would suggest ?\nNo , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c This suggests that reduction of alcohol consumption , even for light to moderate drinkers , is beneficial for cardiovascular health.\n\u201d This further \u201c sheds

now ] the scientific pillars on which it is based appear increasingly shaky indeed.\n\u201d This has led some to ask , \u201c Has the leaning tower of presumed health benefits from \u2018 moderate \u2019 alcohol use finally collapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to alcohol use , it is not surprising that reports suggesting possible mortality benefits for low level users attracted enthusiasm among consumers , the media , and the alcohol industry\u2026 [ but ] these apparent benefits are now evaporating\u2026 \u201d \u201c What conclusions should we draw from this emerging evidence\u2026 ?\nFirstly , in health as elsewhere , if something looks too good to be true \u201d \u2014like butter is back\u2014 \u201d it should be treated with great caution .\nSecondly , health professionals should discourage suggestions that even low level alcohol use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits .\nThirdly , health advice should come from health authorities , not from the alcohol industry\u2026 [ which ] should remove

is produced , which can cause nausea and flushing .\nFor those born with a variant of either of the two enzymes , toxic acetaldehyde can build up , making alcohol consumption a relatively unappealing experience .\n\u2022 Those with enzyme variants are less likely to drink as much and have been found to have a reduced risk of heart disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption , even for light to moderate drinkers , is beneficial for cardiovascular health.\n\u201d \u2022 We should closely examine anything that \u201c looks too good to be true , \u201d discourage suggestions that even light drinking may

"Preventing Alzheimer\u2019s Disease with Diet", "content": "What evidence is there that our meat-sweet diets play a cause-and-effect role in dementia ?\nWhat is behind the dramatic increase in dementia in Japan over recent decades ?\nAs you can see at the start of my video How to Prevent Alzheimer \u2019 s with Diet , rates have climbed significantly .\nIs it due to rising obesity rates or \u201c increases in cholesterol , saturated fat , and iron from increases in animal products and meat supply for Japan \u201d ?\nOverall in Japan , calories only went up about 10 percent , but animal fat and meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ten times the rise in sugary junk .\nDuring this time span , rice consumption went down .\nWas white rice protective in some way so the decrease in intake is to blame ?\nInstead , the thinking is that they were eating something worse : \u201c it seems that the association between rice supply and AD [ Alzheimer \u2019 s disease ] in Japan is more likely due to replacement of rice by animal products.\n\u201d It \u2019 s like when fish consumption is found to be correlated with less disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decrease is actually because of something protective in fish or , instead , because fish just isn \u2019 t as bad as other kinds of meat .\nIf you look across multiple countries , you see a similar pattern : \u201c The most important dietary link to AD appears to be meat consumption , with eggs and high-fat dairy also contributing.\n\u201d As you can see at 1:02 in my video , there appears to be a really tight correlation between Alzheimer \u2019 s and per capita meat supply .\nStudies within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alzheimer \u2019 s and cognitive decline associated with meaty , sweet , and fatty diets , whereas most plant foods are associated with risk reduction .\nThis could be for a variety of reasons .\nAnimal products tend to have more copper , mercury , lead , and cadmium , and no folate , and also contain saturated fat , cholesterol , and pro-inflammatory advanced glycation end products .\nIn fact , \u201c there are many mechanisms linking meat in particular and diet in general to risk of AD \u201d so dietary modification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of Alzheimer \u2019 s .\nHow do we know that it \u2019 s cause and effect , though ?\nWhat is the evidence that meat consumption is linked causally to Alzheimer \u2019 s disease ?\nWell , as you can see at 1:49 in my video , there are a number of plausible mechanisms : the \u201c strength of association , \u201d \u201c consistency of findings \u201d across different types of studies , the fact that the dietary changes preceded the risk of dementia , and the dose response of more meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that meat is a risk factor for other chronic diseases , but there have never been randomized controlled trials to put it to the test for brain dysfunction .\nWhen you read reviews of the \u201c damaging effects of a high-fat diet to the brain and cognition , \u201d \u201c a number of factors have been proposed to cause high-fat diet-induced damage to the brain , especially with aging , including oxidative stress , insulin resistance , inflammation , and changes to vascularization/BBB integrity , \u201d that is , the blood vessels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are based mostly on studies of rodents .\nYes , based on MRI techniques , high-fat diets have been shown to cause energy dysfunction in the brains\u2026of rats .\nWhat about human brains ?\nAt 2:46 in my video , you can see two sets of human cerebral arteries , the arteries deep inside the skull , on autopsy of non-demented elderly individuals compared to Alzheimer \u2019 s patients .\nAs you can see , the cerebral arteries of people with Alzheimer \u2019 s are so clogged with atherosclerotic plaque packed with fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely shut .\nWith CT scans , you can follow the intracranial artery stenosis\u2014that is , the clogging of the brain arteries\u2014over time and observe the progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer \u2019 s disease .\nAs you can see at 3:17 in my video , those who had only low-grade stenosis were fairly stable over time in terms of their cognitive function and ability to dress themselves and execute other activities of daily living , whereas those with more arterial clogging started to slip over the years .\nIn contrast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain atherosclerosis rapidly went downhill and were twice as likely to progress to full-blown Alzheimer \u2019 s .\n\u201c Chronic consumption of Western-style diets enriched in SFA [ saturated fat ] and cholesterol compromise cerebrovascular integrity \u201d \u2014the integrity of the blood vessels in our brain .\nSo , of course , \u201c pharmacological modulation \u201d of diet-induced dysfunction is recommended , but , rather than taking drugs , why not just try to eat more healthfully in the first place ?\n\u2022 The dramatic increase in dementia in Japan over recent decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal products , including meat , and a decrease in rice consumption .\n\u2022 Animal fat and meat consumption has gone up by 500 percent in Japan , while calories only increased by approximately 10 percent .\n\u2022 Across countries , intake of meat , especially , as well as eggs and high-fat dairy , appears to be the \u201c most important dietary link \u201d to Alzheimer \u2019 s disease .\n\u2022 Alzheimer \u2019 s and cognitive decline have been associated with diets heavy in meat , sweets , and fat , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk .\n\u2022 Many factors have been proposed as the cause of high-fat , diet-induced damage to the brain , particularly with aging , including inflammation and changes to blood vessels and the integrity of the blood-brain barrier .\n\u2022 On autopsy , the cerebral arteries of Alzheimer \u2019 s patients are so clogged with atherosclerotic plaque packed with cholesterol and fat that they are nearly closed .\n\u2022 None The standard American diet , rich in saturated fat , cholesterol , and animal products , has been shown to compromise the integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For those familiar with the scientific record , none of this comes as a surprise .\nIn fact , I \u2019 ve covered similar studies in the past .\nCheck out : \u2022 None Oxidized Cholesterol as a Cause of Alzheimer \u2019 s Disease \u2022 Flashback Friday : Preventing

urine mobilization tests , \u201d \u201c challenge tests , \u201d and \u201c provoked urine tests \u201d just a scam ?\nEnvironmental risk factors , meaning non-genetic risk factors , may play a significant role in autism .\nIdentical twins who share the same DNA may not share the condition more than half the time .\nA variety of risk factors have been proposed , such as lead , mercury ,

But what is that based on ?\nI discuss this in my video Heavy Metal Urine Testing and Chelation for Autism .\nMany correlational studies speculate about \u201c the possibility that one of the hidden agents spurring the rise in autism prevalence is to be identified within the industrial system of food production , particularly meat production with special emphasis on poultry meat.\n\u201d As you can see at 0:52 in my video , this is based on the fact that the rise in poultry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to correlate with the rise in autism .\n\u201c The massive contamination of meat\u2026 [ with ] antibiotics , growth hormones and other elements , including toxins such as dioxin , constitutes a serious risk to human health.\n\u201d There are certainly toxicological issues associated with meat production and not just the pollutants , but also leukotoxins , the cooked meat carcinogens .\nA review in the journal Meat Science came up with a whole list , which you can see at 1:18 in my video .\nBut , if anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consuming meat and meat products is carcinogenesis \u201d \u2014cancer , not autism .\nThere are tons of confounding factors that could explain this correlation .\nThe same is seen with fish consumption and autism .\nIn the United States , \u201c mercury-related fish advisories are found to be a surprisingly strong predictor of a state \u2019 s autism rates , \u201d suggesting that \u201c mercury contaminated fish \u201d are to blame , but how many people tend to eat fish from their own state \u2019 s waters ?\nThat in no way \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect mercury\u2013autism connection , \u201d so why would researchers even think to make that connection ?\nWell , as you can see at 2:05 in my video , heavy metals , like mercury and lead , do cause brain damage , and there are some similarities in terms of the symptoms they can cause .\nYou don \u2019 t really know , though\u2026until you put it to the test .\n\u201c \u2018 Urine mobilization test , \u2019 \u2018 challenge test , \u2019 and \u2018 provoked urine test \u2019 are all terms used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d \u2014a heavy metal binding agent\u2014 \u201c to a person prior to collection of their urine to test for metals , \u201d that is , to determine the level of heavy metal burden within their bodies .\nHowever , pediatric , public health , and toxicology authorities recommend against the use of these tests , \u201c based on a lack of scientific validation and a lack of demonstrated benefits to the patients.\n\u201d Nevertheless , these \u201c unconventional test results are usually promoted by alternative practitioners as the basis for recommending , promoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and often inappropriate therapies/interventions supposedly aimed at \u2018 detoxification.\n\u2019 \u201d Indeed , \u201c despite recommendations by professional and government organizations against the use of provoked urine testing , the tests are still commonly used and recommended by some practitioners.\n\u201d What do the results look like ?\nYou can see a chart using the green-yellow-red traffic light convention at 3:00 in my video , which clearly shows mercury is in the red .\n\u201c It is easy for uninformed patients and providers to infer that a result that falls on the yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] poisoning , \u201d but that \u2019 s because they \u2019 re not reading the \u201c fine print.\n\u201d That reference interval , that green range shown in the chart , is the level under non-provoked conditions , meaning normal urine , not the urine from someone who had just been given a chelating drug to provoke the response to intentionally grab onto heavy metals in the body and pull them into the urine .\nThat \u2019 s akin to giving someone a drug that raises their heart rate\u2014like a shot of adrenaline\u2014then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wow !\nYou \u2019 ve got an abnormally high heart rate !\n\u201d Compared to other people who had just gotten a shot of adrenaline ?\nNo , just compared to a regular resting heart rate .\nDuh !\nSee , \u201c there are no established reference ranges for provoked urine samples in healthy subjects , \u201d so researchers are using the wrong reference range .\nWe have no idea what the results actually mean , and , given the \u201c potential harm \u201d of whatever treatment the practitioner then tries to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be utilized.\n\u201d Most commonly , that treatment means chronic chelation therapy .\nA half million people with autism are subjected to chelation therapy in the United States every year , despite \u201c no clinical trial evidence [ that ] suggests \u201d there is any benefit .\nWhy not just give it a try , though ?\nBecause there \u2019 s potential for side effects , like death .\nResearchers refer to a case where a patient was simply given the wrong drug , receiving edetate calcium disodium , not just straight edetate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been an accident .\nEdetate disodium is exactly what is recommended by leading chelation proponents .\n\u201c As such , it would have been surprising only if the practitioner in question\u2026had not chosen the disodium salt.\n\u201d Indeed , \u201c this case was not a simple matter of the \u2018 wrong medication being administered.\n\u2019 \u201d That may just be a distraction from the prospect that \u201c quackery killed the boy.\n\u201d This is not to say that heavy metals aren \u2019 t toxic .\nRather , instead of trying to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should try to help them not get exposed in the first place .\nResearchers compared the blood mercury levels of physicians who either ate no fish at all , one or two servings a week , or three or more weekly servings .\nAs you can see at 5:27 in my video , mercury levels dropped in the group eating at least three servings a week after a single chelation drug dose , but , according to the results , it appears better to eat less fish or no fish at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it seems our autism videos are relatively unpopular in terms of video views .\nThat surprises me , especially since there \u2019 s so much really exciting research out there .\nRemember my Best Foods for Autism series about broccoli sprouts ?\nI thought that was so wild !\nAnyway , if there are topics I \u2019 m not covering that you \u2019 d like me to spend more ( or less ) time on , please let me know .\nEssentially , I cover whatever I see coming in through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a concerted effort to hunt down information on particular topics of interest even if there doesn \u2019 t happen to be anything new coming out about them .\n\u2022 Identical twins share the same DNA but share the condition less than about half of the time .\n\u2022 Autism risk factors may include mercury , lead , birth complications , and persistent organic pollutants , such as PCBs .\n\u2022 The increase in poultry intake , particularly by parents , appears to correlate with the rise in autism .\n\u2022 Meat may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hormones and other elements , including toxins such as dioxin , \u201d and its chronic consumption may pose \u201c a serious risk to human health , \u201d including cancer .\n\u2022 Provoked urine testing , also known as urine mobilization testing and challenge testing , involves the administration of a chelating ( heavy metal-binding ) agent to a person prior to urine collection to determine the level of heavy metal burden in their body .\nThough widely discouraged by public health authorities , among others , due to lack of scientific validation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these \u201c

nutritional benefits of guacamole extend beyond the nutrients in avocados .\nAvocados have been described as a \u201c major dietary source of antioxidants.\n\u201d While this may be true compared to many of the foods people usually eat , they aren \u2019 t necessarily anything to write home about when compared to other common fruits , as you can see at 0:16 in my video Flashback Friday : Are Avocados Good for You ?\n.\nAvocados do , however , contain lutein and zeaxanthin , two carotenoid eye nutrients found in dark green leafy vegetables .\nThis may explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the highest consumers of avocados in the United States , \u201d tend to beat out other ethnicities in their intake of the two nutrients .\nThe critical carotenoids are concentrated in the \u201c dark green flesh close to the peel.\n\u201d Because of this , consumers should be advised to use the \u201c nick and peel \u201d method \u201c to obtain the nutrient-rich outer section of the avocado.\n\u201d The Tufts Health & Nutrition Letter detailed what that means : Cut the avocado in half lengthwise around the seed , rotate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter-avocado segments , separate the quarters , remove the seed , and , finally , starting from the tip , nick and carefully peel each segment , so as not to lose that nutrient-rich , darkest green flesh immediately under the skin .\nAvocados can also boost the absorption of the carotenoid phytonutrients in other vegetables , because carotenoids , such as beta-carotene , are fat soluble .\n\u201c However , many of our best foods for obtaining carotenoids\u2014for example , sweet potatoes , carrots , and leafy greens\u2014contain very little fat ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201d So , if you eat them straight , without any source of fat in your stomach , you may end up flushing a lot of that nutrition down the toilet .\nRemember , it \u2019 s not what you eat , it \u2019 s what you absorb .\nAt 1:41 in my video , you can see there \u2019 s a little bump in the amount of beta-carotene that ends up in your bloodstream over a period of ten hours after eating a little more than a cup of salsa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red pigment lycopene .\nWhat happens when you eat the same amount of salsa with the addition of avocado ?\nAbsorption triples .\nThat means , if you eat tomatoes without some source of fat at the same meal\u2014avocados , nuts , or seeds , for example\u2014most of that bright red , beautiful lycopene will end up in the toilet bowl rather than your bloodstream .\nIt \u2019 s the same with a salad composed of lettuce , spinach , and carrots .\nWith a fat-free dressing , hardly any beta-carotene makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , and 15 times more beta-carotene ends up circulating throughout the body .\nDo you have to use a whole avocado ?\nHalf an avocado had pretty much the same effect , working just as well as a whole one .\nWhat about a quarter of an avocado ?\nWe don \u2019 t know the minimum amount of dietary fat required for optimum carotenoid absorption .\nIt may just be a few grams per meal , though , in which case an eighth of an avocado would fit the bill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interestingly , avocado consumption may enhance not only the absorption of carotenoids , but also their subsequent conversion inside the body into vitamin A .\nAs you can see at 3:10 in my video , when subjects were given baby carrots with and without avocado , as we saw before , much more beta-carotene was detected in the bloodstream of those eating avocados with their carrots in the hours following , compared to the same amount of carrots alone .\nIn fact , there was more than six times more .\nSince beta-carotene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , shouldn \u2019 t there also be six times more vitamin A , too ?\nNo .\nIn fact , the subjects eating avocados ended up with more than 12 times more vitamin A .\nThe avocado-eaters also experienced a big increase in levels of vitamin K , another fat-soluble vitamin .\nThat is partially because avocado itself contains vitamin K\u2014but not so much that people on the anticoagulant medication Coumadin have to worry , claimed an avocado industry-sponsored review .\nHowever , that \u2019 s not true .\nWe \u2019 ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isn \u2019 t an inordinate amount of vitamin K in avocados , it still interferes with the drug Coumadin , also known as warfarin .\nWe aren \u2019 t exactly sure why .\nIt may boost your liver \u2019 s detoxifying enzymes or prevent absorption of the drug , but , either way , those on the blood-thinner Coumadin may want to put walnuts on their salads instead .\n\u2022 Rich in antioxidants , avocados contain lutein and zeaxanthin , two carotenoid eye nutrients concentrated in the dark green flesh close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peel \u201d method is the preferred way to cut an avocado to get the nutrient-rich , darkest green flesh immediately under the peel .\n\u2022 Because carotenoids , such as the beta-carotene in sweet potatoes , are fat-soluble , eating carotenoid-rich foods with avocados can boost the absorption of phytonutrients in other vegetables .\n\u2022 For example , adding avocado to a cup of salsa triples absorption of the red pigment lycopene compared with eating the tomatoes in the salsa without a source of fat ( such as avocados , nuts , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 In addition to enhanced carotenoid absorption , avocado consumption may also improve the conversion of carotenoids inside the body into vitamin A .\n\u2022 Avocado-eaters also experience elevated levels of vitamin K , another fat-soluble vitamin that is contained in avocados themselves .\nVitamin K interferes with Coumadin , a drug also known as warfarin , so those on the blood thinner may want to choose nuts or seeds instead of avocados for a whole food source of fat .\nThis is part of my latest slew of articles on avocados .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ my videos : \u2022 None The Effects of Avocados and

, but what about effects on cognitive function ?\n\u201c At present , we do not know precisely the degree to which the risk of cancer and other adverse health effects are increased by the exposure to the RF [ radiofrequency ] fields from cell phones , smart meters , and other wireless devices.\n\u201d You may recall that I explored the brain tumor data in my video Does Cell Phone Radiation Cause Cancer ?\n, but what other potential adverse health effects might there be ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect brain function ?\nThat \u2019 s the topic of my video Do Mobile Phones Affect Brain Function ?\n.\n\u201c The dramatic increase in use of cellular telephones has generated concern about possible negative effects of radiofrequency signals delivered to the brain .\nHowever , whether acute cell phone exposure affects the human brain is unclear.\n\u201d So , researchers decided to put it to the test using PET scan technology .\nWhat did they find ?\nAs you can see at 0:44 in my video , elevated brain activity was found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the antenna after 50 minutes of exposure to a cell phone call .\nWhat does that actually mean , though ?\nWell , it \u2019 s evidence that the human brain has at least some sensitivity to the effects of cell phone radiation .\nThe increased metabolism in brain regions closest to the antenna \u201c suggest that brain absorption of [ cell phone emissions ] may enhance the excitability of brain tissue.\n\u201d The potential health consequences of this are unknown , though the results suggest that \u201c cell phone use can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affecting neurotransmitter and neurochemical brain activities .\nPerhaps this can explain the changes in psychological test outcomes observed after exposure to cell phone radiation .\nAlthough earlier studies failed to find an effect of short-term cell exposure on human cognitive performance , a 2017 review noted that \u201c several studies indicate an increase in cortical excitability and/or efficiency with EMF exposure , \u201d which may translate out into measurable cognitive effects .\nWhat \u2019 s more , this \u201c cortical excitability \u201d \u2014excitability of the outer layer of the brain tied to cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sleep \u201d while at the same time being \u201c associated with faster reaction time.\n\u201d If you expose people to active cell phones while they play a computer game , the subjects can actually respond faster compared to sham exposure , meaning placebo exposure of the same scenario but with the cell phone turned off .\nThis empowered the industry to claim that while it may be the case that cell phone radiation does affect brain function after all , the effects are positive !\nA decrease in reaction time upon exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps people better respond to different threatening situations .\nTherefore these exposures can decrease the probability of human errors and reduce destructive accidents.\n\u201d But , as you can see at 2:40 in my video , the difference in reaction time was only a few thousandths of a second .\nWhen all the studies are put together , \u201c the effects seem to be so small that implications for human performance in everyday life can be practically ruled out.\n\u201d As you can see at 2:57 in my video , there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users did better on a test of the ability to filter out irrelevant information , but this improvement in focused attention may just be because heavy cell phone users have a lot of practice carrying on conversations in crowded places , \u201c rather than a direct effect of mobile phone use on cognition.\n\u201d Overall , electromagnetic fields from cell phones \u201c do not seem to induce cognitive or psychomotor [ fine motor skill ] effects.\n\u201d Nonetheless , one has to worry about \u201c the existence of sponsorship and publication biases.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as being funded by cellphone companies , and perhaps were designed in a way to skew the results or were quietly shelved and never published if they showed anything negative .\nIn fact , researchers compared the source of funding and results of studies of the health effects of mobile cell phone use and \u201c found that the studies funded exclusively by industry were indeed substantially less likely to report significant effects\u2026that may be relevant to health.\n\u201d It would look suspicious if all the industry studies showed no adverse effects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry of taking obfuscation to a new level .\n\u201c Although the industry-funded studies were significantly more likely to be negative \u201d \u2014that is , show no effects\u2014 \u201c as expected , no two positive studies reported the same effect , and the few attempts to do so failed .\nThus the apparent message of the studies dovetailed well with the [ industry \u2019 s ] position that there are no reproducible biological effects.\n\u201d So , industry wasn \u2019 t only denying the existence of effects ; it was also denying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s like this : If all of the industry-funded studies universally found no adverse effects of cell phone use , in contrast to the findings of independent research , the industry-funded research program could have been more easily dismissed .\nAs well , industry researchers couldn \u2019 t publish adverse health effects because that would be bad for business .\nSo , they came up with a wide hodge-podge of conflicting results .\nIn this way , it seems they can better protect themselves .\nWas this all part of \u201c a well-designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nWe may never know .\nWe do know that when the World Health Organization announced that cell phones may cause brain tumors , the cellphone industry went into damage control to attack the agency , similar to when the WHO came out against second-hand tobacco smoke .\n\u201c Sowing confusion and manufacturing doubt is a well-known strategy used by the tobacco and other industries.\n\u201d \u2022 The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has found that radiation from cell phones may cause brain tumors .\n\u2022 Researchers investigated the impact of radiofrequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found , via PET scan technology , evidence of at least some sensitivity to the effects of cell phone radiation .\n\u2022 Potential health consequences have not yet been determined , but results suggest cellphone usage may affect brain function and seems to increase \u201c cortical excitability , \u201d which may be linked to both sleep disruption and \u201c faster reaction time , \u201d though the difference may be only a few thousandths of a second .\n\u2022 Research funded by the mobile phone industry was found to be substantially less likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no two positive

sure that \u2019 s logical , but they do have a lot of cartilage , which , in general , has few blood vessels , and blood vessels are important for cancer growth .\nSo , all of \u201c these observations\u2026conspired to prime fraught oncology [ cancer ] patients for shameful exploitation by pseudoscience and the supplement industry with the addition of just one myth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t get cancer .\nBut , they do get cancer .\nThe erroneous claim is just another layer of \u201c fallacious arguments \u201d that have \u201c successfully convinced desperate cancer patients to buy

patients with a variety of advanced cancers were given about a dozen scoops a day of shark cartilage .\nThe result ?\nNot a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted in any of their tumors .\nShark cartilage was ineffective \u201c and had no salutary effect on quality of life.\n\u201d In fact , as you can see at 2:38 in my video , the cancer patients suffered significant gastrointestinal toxicity from the shark cartilage , while the tumors progressed in each one of them .\nWhat happened in the control group ?\nThere was no control group , so how do we know the cancers wouldn \u2019 t have progressed

Unfortunately , the claims for the benefits of shark cartilage are completely unsubstantiated by any objective data from controlled clinical trials.\n\u201d Not so fast , said supplement manufacturers .\nMaybe these crude commercial shark cartilage powders just don \u2019 t have high enough levels of whatever active components there may be .\nIn that case , maybe cancer patients should be taking

powerful phytoestrogen found in hops , an essential ingredient in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibroids risk , what about the phytoestrogens in soy ?\nThe Black Women \u2019 s Health Study looked into this .\nFibroids are two to three times more prevalent among Black women , so it was thought that dairy intake might be contributing to the disparity , given Black women \u2019 s higher levels of lactose intolerance .\nIndeed , dairy consumption was associated with reduced risk , perhaps , thought researchers , because of the calcium or vitamin D content .\nWas it possible the women were drinking soy milk instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nNo .\nSoy intake was found to be unrelated .\nThe same was found in a group of predominantly white women , though researchers did note a protective association with the amount of lignans flowing through their bodies .\nLignans are another class of phytoestrogens found predominantly in flaxseeds but also throughout the plant kingdom .\nIt was hard for the researchers to make any generalizations about the soy phytoestrogens , though , because soy consumption by the subjects was rather low across the board .\nThat research was done in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest per capita soy consumption in the world , which could allow for a bigger spread of intakes .\nResearchers had \u201c previously found that soya intake was inversely associated with the risk of

specifically looked at that connection , they found there was no evidence of a link to soy at all , protective or otherwise .\nThe same was found in a study from China .\nAs you can see at 3:18 in my

find a significant association between soy milk intake and fibroids , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women with symptomatic fibroids reporting an \u201c unusually high intake of soy milk , \u201d \u201c regularly consuming excessive amounts of soy , or having \u201c an extremely high intake of soy \u201d every day for decades .\nIt \u2019 s hard to take these cases seriously when nowhere does it specify how much they were consuming .\nThe only quantitative mention was 40 grams of isoflavones , roughly equivalent to 400 gallons of soy milk every day , which would be excessive , but also impossible .\nThe only way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the test\u2014and not just in a population study or anecdotal reports , but to randomize women to two years of soy phytoestrogens in the amount found in three to five cups of soy milk a day .\nWhen researchers did just that , no significant effect on the frequency or growth of fibroids was found .\n\u2022 About 25 percent of women will suffer from fibroids , which commonly manifest as excessively heavy periods , pain , or pressure and are the most common reason for hysterectomies .\n\u2022 Alcohol consumption , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of fibroids .\n\u2022 Fibroids are two to three times more prevalent among Black women , who have higher levels of lactose intolerance .\n\u2022 Per capita soy consumption is highest in Japan .\nResearchers had

recognized that occupational use of bleach may have adverse respiratory health effects , it is unknown whether common domestic use of bleach may be a risk factor for asthma \u201d \u2014rather , it was unknown\u2026until now .\nBleach use was significantly associated with nearly five times the odds of non-allergic adult-onset asthma , as well as ongoing lower respiratory symptoms , such as

are natural , environmentally friendly cleaning products that may offer a safer alternative .\nSafer , perhaps , but are they as effective ?\nThat \u2019 s the topic of my video Flashback Friday : Do

natural disinfectant worked just as well as bleach , though .\nWhat about the DIY solution ?\nThe club soda , vinegar , and tea tree oil concoction flopped , allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Staph bugs to thrive .\nThe researchers might not have used enough of the tea tree oil , though , only adding about a drop per cup , but , from a performance perspective , the environmentally preferable product based on thymol from the thyme essential oil is \u201c an effective alternative \u201d to conventional bleach .\nI would say it \u2019 s even better because bleach is \u201c well known as a

something special in the plant .\nCan you get the benefit by just eating the kale instead of juicing it ?\nResearchers tested the effect of black cabbage ( Lacinato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuscan kale ) and red cabbage on oxidized LDL .\nEvery day for two weeks , subjects ate a bag of frozen kale and cabbage , which could be conveniently kept in the freezer , pre-washed and pre-chopped , ready to add to any

the half-dozen Viagra-type drugs on the market now , Viagra itself may have \u201c the greatest efficacy but also the highest rate of overall adverse events , \u201d or side effects .\nIt \u2019 s still a pretty safe drug , though .\nFor instance , one guy swallowed 65 tablets in \u201c an unsuccessful suicide attempt , \u201d but it didn \u2019 t work .\nThe most commonly observed acute side effects include headache , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and vision abnormalities , but now that it \u2019 s been around for a decade , some chronic effects may be cropping up , such as glaucoma , one of the leading causes of blindness , caused by degeneration of the optic nerve .\nIndeed , those using Viagra long-term have up to nearly ten times the odds of glaucoma .\nBut , it \u2019 s cancer that has the medical community rethinking the safety of these kinds of drugs , as I discuss in my video Viagra and Cancer .\nMen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a radical prostatectomy , a surgery that can leave them both incontinent and impotent , which can reduce their quality of life .\n\u201c Therefore , the treatment concept called penile rehabilitation was introduced , \u201d where drugs like Viagra are given to counteract the side effects of the surgery .\nBut , some studies have found that Viagra could decrease natural killer cell activity , and natural killer cells are our first line of immune defense against cancer .\nOne such study was on women , but it did raise concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer .\nIn terms of getting prostate cancer in the first place , men treated with Viagra-type drugs \u201c tended to have less of a chance of being diagnosed with prostate cancer , \u201d but that may just be because they \u2019 re ejaculating more .\nIndeed , \u201c high ejaculation frequency possibly may be associated with a lower risk of\u2026prostate cancer.\n\u201d The reason researchers think this may be the case is interesting : \u201c Frequent ejaculations may decrease the\u2026concentration of xenobiotic compounds and chemical carcinogens , \u201d like hormone-disrupting chemicals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnything we eat can end up in our prostate .\nDrink a cup of coffee , for instance , and you end up with caffeinated semen ten hours later .\nSmoke a cigarette , and the nicotine ends up in semen , too .\nWhat happens when you eat fish ?\nYou end up with one-seventh the healthy sperm count compared to men who don \u2019 t eat fish , perhaps because \u201c fish eaters \u201d had about three times the concentration of PCBs , as you can see at 2:28 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know for sure what the story is with Viagra , though , until we put it to the test .\nResearchers followed nearly 5,000 prostate cancer survivors and found that those taking Viagra-type drugs did seem to have a little bump in their risk of the cancer coming back , but subsequent studies failed to find such an association .\nWhat moved me to write this article was learning about the unexpected connection between Viagra and melanoma skin cancer .\n\u201c If treated early , melanoma can be cured by surgical resection [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its proclivity to metastasize , in about 20 % of patients it progresses to an aggressive invasive disease \u201d that can kill in a matter of months .\nPart of the way it does this is through a gene mutation in the cancer , which induces melanoma cell invasion by downregulating an enzyme called phosphodiesterase 5 .\nDoes that sound familiar ?\nIt may because that \u2019 s what Viagra does .\nViagra is a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor .\nSo , Viagra may have the same effect in terms of promoting melanoma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , until you put it to the test .\nIndeed , Viagra use was associated with an 84 percent \u201c increased risk of subsequent melanoma \u201d diagnosis , and , when you put all the studies together , the association remains significant , as you can see at 4:04 in my video .\nWhat does this mean ?\nWell , we have this class of drugs like Viagra , Cialis , and Levitra \u201c found in medicine cabinets throughout our communities , \u201d and the FDA does its best trying \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such drugs , \u201d but you can \u2019 t \u201c always anticipate the molecular consequences of inhibiting major cellular pathways.\n\u201d There is , however , an alternative explanation : Maybe users of Viagra are just naked more , \u201c thus giving their partners the opportunity to detect melanomas on their skin \u201d and notice some suspicious mole or something .\nIndeed , only about one in three melanomas are discovered by the patients themselves .\nIt can sometimes take years for serious side effects to be recognized , so rather than just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should treat the underlying cause with lifestyle changes whenever possible .\n\u2022 Viagra \u2019 s acute side effects including headache , flushing , stomach upset , runny nose , and vision abnormalities , and long-term use of the drug may cause chronic effects , such as glaucoma , one of the leading causes of blindness .\n\u2022 Some studies have shown that Viagra may decrease activity of our natural killer cells , which are our first line of immune defense against cancer .\n\u2022 Men on Viagra-type drugs appeared less likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be due to higher ejaculation frequency .\nIndeed , frequent ejaculations may decrease the concentration of carcinogens and hormone-disrupting chemicals within the prostate gland itself .\n\u2022 Melanoma ( skin cancer ) has a proclivity to metastasize and , in about one in five patients , progresses to an \u201c aggressive invasive disease \u201d that can kill in just months , partly through a gene mutation that induces melanoma cell invasion by downregulating the phosphodiesterase 5 enzyme .\n\u2022 Use of Viagra , a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor , has been associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melanoma diagnosis .\n\u2022 It is possible that users of Viagra are more often naked , \u201c

"title": "Sources of Oxidized Cholesterol", "content": "Chicken , fish , and egg powder in processed foods present greater risk from cholesterol oxidation byproducts , but there are things you can do to reduce exposure .\n\u201c A significant body of evidence indicates that oxidized cholesterol , in the form of oxysterols , is one of the main triggers of AD [ Alzheimer \u2019 s disease ] .\n\u201d But , that \u2019 s not all .\nCholesterol oxidation products ( COPs ) \u201c are associated with the initiation and progression of major chronic diseases , \u201d including heart disease , diabetes , and kidney failure .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ heated .\nAll forms of cooking can do it , since you can get \u201c maximum cholesterol oxidation and COP production \u201d at only about 300 degrees Fahrenheit , but are there any types of cooking that are worse than others ?\nAs I discuss in my video How to Reduce Cholesterol Oxidation , if you look at \u201c foal meat \u201d \u2014baby horse meat\u2014higher levels of oxidation in general were found in microwaved meat , as you can see at 0:40 in the video .\nIndeed , microwaving chicken or beef appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxidation as does frying .\nIf you look at bacon , though , raw bacon didn \u2019 t have any oxidized cholesterol .\nLike all animal products , it has cholesterol , but it \u2019 s not oxidized until you cook it .\nGrilling seems to be the safest if you eat the meat right away , but if you put leftovers in the refrigerator and reheat them later using the same method , all the oxidized cholesterol levels shoot up , as you can see at 0:58 in my video .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAlthough levels in raw meats are usually low , \u201c their concentrations tend to increase dramatically after exposure to proxidant [ or , pro-oxidation ] agents such as light.\n\u201d Okay , but it isn \u2019 t like you can crawl inside the pig and eat bacon from the inside .\nIsn \u2019 t meat always exposed to light ?\nWell , but you could wrap the meat in red plastic wrap .\nClear plastic wrap doesn \u2019 t seem to work , but red film blocks some of the light waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked for \u201c horse meat slices.\n\u201d The problem is worse with sliced meat products , because more of the meat is exposed to air and light .\nIt \u2019 s the same with ground meat\u2014it \u2019 s just so much more exposed .\nUnless you keep meat in some kind of vacuum pack , the oxygen exposure alone can shoot up oxidation levels even in a dark refrigerator or the freezer .\nAs you can see at 2:04 in my video , cooking raw fish can boost cholesterol oxides levels from 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a few months , frozen fish\u2014even frozen raw fish\u2014starts out about ten times higher and just goes up from there .\nIn terms of which meat is the worst , chicken was twice as bad as beef , whether microwaved or fried .\nIt seems the reason has to do with the polyunsaturated fat content of the muscle , which \u201c decreases in the order fish [ with the highest content ] > poultry > pork > beef > lamb.\n\u201d So , white meat is more susceptible to cholesterol oxidation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ but fish and chicken tend to build up more oxidized cholesterol .\nSo , chicken and roasted salmon have been shown to generate greater amounts of cholesterol oxidation products than other types of meat .\nSurprisingly , though , the highest increase of oxidized cholesterol in salmon was found through steaming , mainly because it \u2019 s just exposed to heat longer .\nCholesterol oxidation increased after each cooking procedure , but \u201c steaming increased the total amount by more than 1000 % .\n\u201d There are two ways chicken meat may pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feed the chickens rancid fat .\nUnfortunately , all manner of substandard \u201c fat by- and coproducts \u201d may end up at the rendering plants to be turned into animal feed .\nThe second way is irradiation .\nAs you can see at 3:28 in my video , when chicken meat is irradiated to improve its food safety from an infectious disease standpoint , it may diminish food safety from a chronic disease standpoint\u2014but , hey , It \u2019 s better than dying from Salmonella .\nIn terms of dairy , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential dangers of ghee in my video Oxidized Cholesterol as a Cause of Alzheimer \u2019 s Disease , which made me wonder about UHT milk .\nUHT stands for ultra-high temperature processing .\nIt \u2019 s used to make those little Half & Half \u201c no refrigeration needed \u201d coffee creamers .\nAs you can see at 4:00 in my video , UHT appears to boost oxidized cholesterol levels by about 50 percent , which is more than regular pasteurization .\nInterestingly , however , if you can find goat milk Half & @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Same problem with eggs .\nEgg powder in processed foods is good for shelf life , but it may not be so good for human life .\nSome examples of packaged foods with egg products include some pastas , many baked goods , and mayonnaise .\nSo , even people who stay away from eggs out of the egg carton may still be exposed unwittingly through processed foods if they don \u2019 t read the ingredients label .\nIf it \u2019 s all about oxidation , why not just add synthetic or natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The meat industry has certainly tried\u2014for instance , adding lemon balm tea to hamburger patties .\nIt didn \u2019 t work , but that \u2019 s likely because they couldn \u2019 t add enough without affecting the taste .\nWhat about adding cherries ?\nThey \u2019 re red , so they would blend right in .\nAs you can see at 5:00 in my video , cherries worked !\nTwo different types of tart cherries significantly reduced the cholesterol oxidation , but meat with a cherry on top seems a little odd .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ onions ?\nThe amount of oxidized cholesterol in a plain pork chop significantly dropped by adding onion or garlic , as you can see at 5:13 in my video .\nInterestingly , though , in chicken , cholesterol oxidation was helped by sage but not garlic .\nIn fact , garlic may even accelerate chicken fat oxidation .\nSo , \u201c there are several measures that can be taken to reduce cholesterol oxidation in foods : reducing the total cholesterol content of foodstuffs by not cooking food with cholesterol-containing fat [ like butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antioxidants , adding antioxidants to food , processing food at low temperatures , using oxygen-excluding packs [ opaque vacuum packing , for example ] , and storing food in the dark.\n\u201d But , if you take a step back , you see that only foods starting out with cholesterol can end up with oxidized cholesterol .\nSo , in terms of reducing cholesterol oxidation in foods , the primary method may be to \u201c reduce the total cholesterol content of the food \u201d \u2014that is , don \u2019 t just avoid adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s diet around whole plant foods , which don \u2019 t have any cholesterol to get oxidized in the first place .\n\u2022 In the form of oxysterols , oxidized cholesterol is thought to be a primary trigger of Alzheimer \u2019 s disease , and cholesterol oxidation products ( COPs ) have been associated with the initiation and progression of such major chronic diseases as heart disease , kidney failure , and diabetes .\n\u2022 COPs are produced when animal products are heated , and all methods of cooking can do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2022 Microwaving chicken and beef appears to produce about twice as much cholesterol oxidation as frying , and grilling seems to be the safest if the meat is eaten immediately .\nIf leftovers are

agents , though red film ( as opposed to clear plastic wrap ) blocks some light waves and may delay cholesterol oxidation .\n\u2022 Red meat has more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white meat is more susceptible to

message that \u2019 s been around since 1866 , but is it true ?\nYou don \u2019 t know , until you put it to the test .\nAs I discuss in my video Flashback Friday : Does an Apple a Day Really Keep the Doctor Away ?\n.\nThe objective of \u201c The Association Between Apple Consumption and Physician Visits , \u201d an article published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine journal , was simple : \u201c To examine the relationship between eating an apple a day and keeping the doctor away.\n\u201d The message has been \u201c promoted by the lay media and powerful special interest groups , including the US Apple Association \u201d \u2014a force so powerful that it spent a whopping $ 7,000 lobbying politicians during the 2017-18 election cycle .\n( Okay , so maybe Big Apple is more like an itty bitty appletini . )\nAt any rate , the beneficial effects of apple consumption may include facilitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neurologic degradation [ protection of the brain ] , cancer suppression , reduction in asthma symptoms , and improved cardiovascular health.\n\u201d So , apple consumers ought to require less medical care , right ?\n\u201c Although some may jest , considering the relatively low cost of apples\u2026a prescription for apple consumption could potentially reduce national health care spending if the aphorism holds true.\n\u201d Researchers compared daily apple eaters to non-apple eaters and asked if they had been to the doctor in the last year , been hospitalized , seen a mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medication within the last month .\nMore than 8,000 individuals were surveyed , and only about one out of ten reported they had eaten an apple in the last 24 hours .\nThe finding ?\n\u201c Evidence does not support that an apple a day keeps the doctor away\u2026 \u201d Maybe it takes more than an apple a day ?\nMaybe we need to center our whole diet around plant foods .\n\u201c However , the small fraction of US adults who eat an apple a day do appear to use fewer prescription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should \u201c update the well-known proverb to clarify that , if anything , apple eating may help keep the pharmacist away.\n\u201d But , based on the average medical prescription cost , the researchers estimate that \u201c the difference in annual prescription medication cost per capita between apple eaters ( $ 1697 ) and non-apple eaters ( $ 1925 ) to be $ 228 \u201d \u2014hundreds of dollars saved .\nSo , if all U.S. adults were apple eaters , we could save nearly $ 50 billion .\nOf course , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , our net savings would be closer to $ 19 billion , but that \u2019 s still a hefty chunk of change .\nIf this all seems a bit like tongue-in-cheek-apple-polishing , you may be tickled to learn this study was published suspiciously close to April Fool \u2019 s Day .\nIndeed , this was in the tradition of the British Medical Journal \u2019 s annual Christmas issue that features scientifically rigorous , yet light-hearted , research .\nIn fact , the BMJ itself took on the apple issue to model the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all older adults prescribed either a cholesterol-lowering statin drug or an apple a day .\nEssentially , researchers took studies like the one I show at 3:06 in my video , where we see a nice dose response indicating the more fruit you eat , the lower your stroke risk appears to fall , as well as similar data found for heart disease compared to the known drug effects , and concluded that prescribing an apple a day \u201c is likely to have a similar effect \u201d on population stroke and heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead .\nBonus that apples only have good side effects .\n\u201c Choosing apples rather than statins may avoid more than a thousand excess cases of myopathy [ muscle damage ] and more than 12 000 excess diabetes diagnoses \u201d ( because statins increase the risk of diabetes ) .\nAnd , this article was from the UK .\nIn the United States , one would expect five times those numbers .\nIronically , though , the cost of apples is likely to be greater than that of statin drugs .\n( Generic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . )\nSo , yes , \u201c with similar reductions in mortality , the 150 year old health promotion message [ of an apple a day ] is able to match modern medicine and is likely to have fewer side effects , \u201d but apples are a few pennies a day more expensive , not to mention they \u201c require

muscle soreness in athletes ?\nHigher fruit and vegetable consumption was \u201c positively associated with muscle power \u201d in adolescents , but they aren \u2019 t the ones who really need it .\nWhat about the consumption of fruits and vegetables and the risk of frailty in older adults ?\nResearchers found that higher fruit and vegetable consumption was \u201c associated with a lower short-term risk of frailty in a dose-response manner , \u201d meaning more fruits or vegetables and less frailty .\nThose were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , can \u2019 t prove cause and effect .\nWhat happens when you put foods to the test ?\nAs I discuss in my video Flashback Friday : Foods to Improve Athletic Performance and Recovery , there was \u201c no positive influence of ingesting chia seed oil on human running performance , \u201d but an effect was found for \u201c spinach supplementation on exercise-induced oxidative stress.\n\u201d Spinach supplementation ?\nThat just meant researchers gave some guys fresh , raw spinach leaves\u2014one gram per kilo of body weight , which turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch a day\u2014for two weeks and then had them run a half marathon .\nThey found that \u201c chronic daily oral supplementation of spinach \u201d \u2014like eating a salad\u2014 \u201c has alleviating effects on known markers of oxidative stress and muscle damage\u2026 \u201d As you can see at 1:16 in my video , when you run a half marathon without supplementing with spinach , you get a big spike in oxidative stress and blood malondialdehyde levels that stay up for hours or even days later .\nIn the spinach group , there isn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks of spinach , but you can really see the difference after you put the body under pressure .\nAfter the rigors of a half marathon , your body , supplemented with spinach , is better able to deal with the stress .\nWhat happens when you look at muscle damage , as measured by creatine kinase ( CK ) leakage from the muscles ?\n( CK is an enzyme that should be in your muscles , not leaking out into your blood . )\nResearchers found that levels started at about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U/L right after the half marathon , two hours later .\nThe next day is when you really feel that delayed onset-muscle soreness , though .\nWithout spinach supplementation , CK levels reached 600 U/L the day after the half marathon before coming back down .\nBut on spinach ?\nYou get a similar immediate post-race bump in CK leakage , but spinach really shines that next day : You don \u2019 t get the same next-day spike .\nSo , for a competitive athlete , that quicker recovery may get you training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed this to spinach \u2019 s anti-inflammatory effects .\nAs you can see at 2:36 in my video , the same effects were found with black currant juice .\nAfter some hardcore weight lifting , muscle damage indicators went up and stayed up , whereas they went up but came right back down when that same weight lifting was paired with drinking berries .\nThese were just measures of a biomarker of muscle soreness , however .\nWhat about actual soreness ?\nIf you look at the effects of tart cherry juice on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soccer players , you see the same kind of reduction in biomarkers of inflammation .\nBut , more importantly , you see less resulting muscle soreness , which I show at 3:08 in my video .\nThe soreness reported by the athletes in cherry group in the days following running those sprints was only about half of that in the placebo group .\nResearchers then measured maximum voluntary isometric contractions of the leg muscles .\nThey understandably took a hit in the days after the intense workout , though not in the cherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who supplemented with a tart cherry concentrate \u201c were able to maintain greater functional performance , \u201d but that was in testing how high participants could jump vertically .\nThey didn \u2019 t look at whether the athletes were able to play soccer any better , but a study on purple grape juice actually showed \u201c an ergogenic effect in recreational runners by promoting increased time-to-exhaustion.\n\u201d Participants ran on a treadmill , and the researchers measured how long they could go before collapsing .\nAs you can see at 3:56 in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either a grape Kool-Aid-type placebo control drink or real grape juice , there was no real change in performance in the placebo group , but those in the real grape group got a whopping 15 percent improvement , hanging on for an additional 12 minutes before reaching exhaustion .\nThese studies used juice , so the researchers could make matched placebo control drinks , but you can buy fresh Concord grapes or tart cherries that are fresh , frozen , or water-packed in a can .\nI mix them with oatmeal , cocoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensation .\nYou may want to try that for a few days before participating in your next big sporting event .\n\u2022 Observational studies have found that greater intake of fruits and vegetables is positively associated with muscle power in teens and a lower short-term risk of frailty in older adults .\n\u2022 Although chia seed oil has no positive influence on running performance , researchers found that eating spinach each day ( about a quarter bunch daily ) had \u201c alleviating effects on known markers of oxidative stress and muscle damage \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not supplement with spinach .\n\u2022 Creatine kinase ( CK ) is an enzyme found in muscle that leaks into the blood when muscle has been damaged .\nWhen researchers measured the runners \u2019 CK levels before , immediately after , and the day after the half marathon , they found that those who supplemented with spinach did not get the same next-day spike indicating muscle damage that those who did not take spinach experienced .\n\u2022 For competitive athletes , this quicker recovery attributed to spinach \u2019 s anti-inflammatory effects may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more intensively .\n\u2022 Similar effects were found with black current juice \u2019 s effect on muscle soreness in weight-lifters .\n\u2022 Tart cherry juice also results in reduction of biomarkers of inflammation , as well as less muscle soreness following prolonged , intermittent sprints in soccer players .\n\u2022 A study with purple grapes showed that a month of drinking their juice resulted in a 15 percent improvement compared with those drinking a grape Kool-Aid-type placebo control .\nThe real juice drinkers were able to run an additional 12 minutes on @ @

?\n\u201c There are many examples in nature of intestinal microbes altering host behavior .\nOne such example involves the eukaryotic pathogen Toxoplasma gondii when it infects a rodent , causing the animal to lose its innate fear of the odor of bobcat urine.\n\u201d The brain parasite , infecting the rodent through the gut , finds its way into the brain .\nWhy does the parasite care about what mice are afraid of ?\nBecause , by not avoiding predators , they \u2019 re more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parasite is \u201c then excreted in the bobcat stool where it is able to infect other rodents.\n\u201d If you \u2019 re a mouse-brain parasite , how are you going to spread ?\nMice aren \u2019 t cannibals , so you have to make sure the mouse you \u2019 re in is eaten by something else .\nSo , the parasite evolved a way to alter the mouse \u2019 s behavior .\nGiven the potential power of microbes to affect behavior , might the disruption of our gut microbiome , our good gut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the causation of autism ?\nThat \u2019 s the very topic I cover in my video The Role of the Gut Microbiome in Autism .\nAs you can see at 1:06 in my video , kids with autism do tend to have altered gut flora , different from those of children without autism .\nFor example , autistic children have significantly less Prevotella , which characterize the healthy gut enterotype that you can foster the growth of yourself with a more plant-based diet .\nBut which came first ?\nInstead of the bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t it more likely that the autism led to the bad gut flora ?\nCompared with \u201c healthy controls , \u201d children with autism eat significantly fewer daily servings of fruits and vegetables , and their diets are \u201c often characterized by a lack of variety , an inadequate amount of fiber-containing foods \u201d \u2014meaning not enough whole plant foods in general\u2014 \u201c and an increased amount of sugar-containing foods.\n\u201d So , couldn \u2019 t that explain the different gut flora ?\nThere are some perinatal risk factors for the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low birth weight , and , particularly , delivery by caesarean section .\nWhat does a C-section have to do with the microbiome ?\n\u201c There may be a protective value offered by the maternal vaginal microbiome \u201d that infants miss out on when they are delivered through a surgical incision instead .\nDuring a C-section , sometimes the mothers are placed under general anesthesia , and it \u2019 s possible that the anesthetics could affect the babies \u2019 brains before the infants are disconnected from the maternal blood supply .\nTo differentiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d need a study that compared autism risk between C-sections where the moms got an epidural or spinal block versus caesareans when the moms were under general anesthesia , and we got just that .\n\u201c This study examined the incidence of autism in neonates delivered vaginally , by C-section with regional anesthesia ( RA ) , and by C-section with general anesthesia ( GA ) , \u201d and only those infants delivered by C-section under general anesthesia had a higher risk , not those delivered vaginally or by C-sections with RA where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example .\nThis suggests the C-section connection is related to anesthesia drug exposure rather than involving the lack of vaginal flora exposure .\nThis wasn \u2019 t an interventional trial , though , in which mothers were randomized to the various groups ; it was just an observational study .\nIt \u2019 s possible the increased autism risk had less to do with the anesthetic itself than the pregnancy complications that may have led to having to put the mother under .\nEither way , there doesn \u2019 t seem to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for children with autism , but , so far , they don \u2019 t seem to have helped much .\nSome families , in desperation , have tried fecal transplants .\nThey aren \u2019 t FDA-approved , though , so families are forced to go on the \u201c brown \u201d market .\n( Ahem . )\nWhere did this idea come from ?\nIt can all be traced back to a remarkable study published in the Journal of Child Neurology .\n\u201c Several parents of children with regressive-onset autism \u201d \u2014that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the autism struck\u2014noted that the change in behavior seemed to start after their child had taken antibiotics .\nThey had gotten chronic diarrhea , suggesting that the antibiotics had mucked with their gut flora .\nThen came the loss of language , play , and social skills .\nIt all could have been a total coincidence , but it led a group of pediatric gastroenterologists to speculate that maybe there was some cause-and-effect link .\nMaybe by wiping out the good bugs , some bad , neurotoxic bugs took hold , which led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , perhaps they could clean the slate once again with another dose of antibiotics , but this time to try to clear out any bad bugs .\nMight \u201c appropriately targeted antimicrobial therapy\u2026reduce autism symptoms in these individuals \u201d ?\nThat would be groundbreaking .\nAs you can see at 5:17 in my video , after researchers put the kids on a powerful antibiotic called vancomycin , 80 percent of the children got better .\nBut , within a few weeks after the treatment , most of them slipped back toward their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bugs got pushed down but not out .\nThe study was conducted nearly 20 years ago and only had an \u201c n \u201d of 11 , meaning it only looked at 11 kids .\n( The letter n is research-speak for the number of subjects in a study . )\nSurely , by now , lots of larger studies have been done , right ?\nIn reality , only a single follow-up study has been published , and it had an n of 1 .\n\u201c An n = 1 case report of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a father \u2019 s quest to understand what it all may mean \u201d was written by the father himself , describing a dramatic improvement in his child \u2019 s autism after taking amoxicillin .\nWhen he talked to other parents of autistic children , he \u201c discovered , much to [ his ] surprise , that many\u2026routinely give their children antibiotics to improve their symptoms.\n\u201d He also heard from other parents , though , who \u201c felt that their children \u2019 s autism symptoms became worse when they received antibiotics \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blamed for the emergence of the disorder in the first place .\nAll of that speaks to the potential role of the gut flora , however , reinforcing the notion .\nWhen he scoured the medical literature to learn more , all he could find was that study I mentioned with only 11 children .\nHow is it possible there haven \u2019 t been follow-up studies ?\nRight before his eyes , he witnessed the evidence in his own child of what that study had shown .\nHe saw this seemingly intractable condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an antibiotic\u2014at least in his child .\nSurprisingly , there have been no attempts to repeat that study .\nI think most parents would count their blessings that it at least worked on their child and leave it at that , but not this parent .\nHe started his own autism research foundation , the N of One , \u201c with the mission of encouraging , sponsoring , and communicating breakthrough autism research.\n\u201d I referred to my video Flashback Friday : What \u2019 s Your Gut Microbiome Enterotype ?\n, which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important one , however , is How to Change Your Enterotype .\n\u2022 One example of intestinal microbes altering host behavior is Toxoplasma gondii , a eukaryotic pathogen that infects the guts of rodents and causes them to lose their innate fear of the odor of bobcat urine .\nThe rodents infected by the brain parasite don \u2019 t avoid predators and are more likely to become prey , and the parasite is able to spread by being excreted in the bobcat stool where it can infect other rodents .\n\u2022 Autistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that differs from kids without autism .\nThey have , for example , significantly less Prevotella , which characterize the healthy gut enterotype that can be fostered with a more plant-based diet .\n\u2022 This follows since autistic kids typically eat significantly fewer fruits and vegetables each day , and their diets often lack a diversity of foods and inadequate servings of foods with fiber , yet increased amounts of sugar .\n\u2022 Perinatal risk factors for the development of autism include premature birth , low birth weight , and delivery by caesarean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2022 Probiotics for children with autism do not appear to be helpful .\n\u2022 A study published in the Journal of Child Neurology introduced the idea of fecal transplants , which are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration .\nParents of children with regressive-onset autism noted behavior changes in their kids after taking antibiotics for chronic diarrhea , suggesting the medicine altered their gut flora , which was followed by loss

of Guacamole", "content": "High-fat plant foods\u2014avocados , peanuts , and walnuts\u2014and olive oil are put to the test .\nIn the preface of my book How Not to Die , after bemoaning the fact that although Big Pharma offered me countless steak dinners during my medical training , Big Broccoli never asked me out , I wrote that you \u2019 ll probably never see an ad on TV for whole natural foods because there just isn \u2019 t much of a markup , they aren \u2019 t shelf-stable , and you can \u2019 t brand them , patent them , or trademark them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as profitable as junk .\nBut , I may have to eat those words .\nAs I discuss in my video Flashback Friday : The Effects of Avocados on Inflammation , there was a TV ad for avocados\u2014aired during the Super Bowl , no less\u2014and it wasn \u2019 t for avocado-flavored Doritos or something like that .\nIt was an ad for the actual fruit .\nThanks in part to the billions of avocados sold every year , the Avocado Board has $ 50 million\u2014not only for ads but for research , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its burger study , in which the addition of avocado blunted the spike in inflammation one gets within hours of eating meat .\nAmazing .\nThe burger with more added fat and more calories from the avocado produced less inflammation , perhaps because the added fat and calories were in the form of a whole plant food , which tend to be packed with antioxidants that can inhibit the formation of oxidized fats that are formed when meat is cooked and when it hits your stomach acid .\nDo other high-fat , high-calorie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect ?\nWhat about peanuts , for example .\nNot to be outdone by Big Guac , the Peanut Institute funded a study with the understanding that most of us spend most of our waking hours in a postprandial state\u2014that is , an after-meal state\u2014and the fat from those meals that courses through our systems is \u201c a well-recognized risk factor for atherosclerosis , \u201d the number one killer of men and women , manifesting as \u201c impaired endothelial function.\n\u201d That means we may have crippled artery function within hours of eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 1,200 calories of mostly sugar and heavy cream .\nWell , what if you drank that same milkshake with 3 ounces of peanuts thrown in ?\nTo mimic the nutritional profile of the added peanuts as closely as possible , the researchers tried to match up the added fat and protein by adding oil , egg whites , and even a fiber supplement to the control .\nSo , as you can see at 2:07 in my video , the two milkshakes had pretty much the same amounts of calories , sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fiber .\nSo , on paper , it would seem the two shakes should cause the same reaction in the body , right ?\nBut peanuts are whole plant foods , so what you don \u2019 t see listed in a nutrient profile are the thousands of phytonutrients in the peanut milkshake that are missing from the non-peanut shake .\nDid the phytonutrients make any difference ?\nAs you can see at 2:44 in my video , within hours of consuming the non-peanut milkshake , all that saturated fat and sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by about 20 percent .\nJust one milkshake reduced the ability of our arteries to relax and dilate normally by 20 percent !\nOkay , but what if you consumed the same amount of saturated fat and sugar but with a little real food thrown in ?\nThere was no significant drop in artery function !\nThe peanuts helped preserve artery function in response to the endothelial insult , a \u201c cardioprotective effect \u201d presumably due to the active phytonutrients in the peanuts and peanut skins .\nWalnuts may work even better .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ my video , after you eat a salami and cheese sandwich with some olive oil , artery function plummets by about a third , but if you replace that olive oil with the same amount of plant fat in the form of whole walnuts , you don \u2019 t just blunt the effect of the salami and cheese\u2014you reverse it .\nYou end up even better than you started out .\nWhat about avocados ?\n\u201c Research indicates that energy-dense [ calorie-dense ] foods increase inflammation and oxidative activity , thereby contributing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease .\nHowever , it is not clear whether the high kilojoule [ calorie ] load alone , irrespective of the nutritional content of the ingested food , produces the postprandial [ after-the-meal ] oxidative and inflammatory activity.\n\u201d So , researchers compared the impact of \u201c a high-fat , high-sugar , phytonutrient-reduced food ( ice cream ) \u201d to the effects of the exact same number of calories of a \u201c phytonutrient-rich whole food ( avocado ) .\n\u201d If it \u2019 s just the concentration of calories and fat , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same effect .\nThe researchers tested reactions to four different meals : ( 1 ) ice cream , ( 2 ) avocado , ( 3 ) just the fat and protein from the ice cream ( to separate out the sugar ) , and ( 4 ) just the amount of sugar in the ice cream ( to separate out the effects of the saturated butterfat ) .\nAs you can see at 4:43 in my video , the four \u201c food/food components \u201d were ice cream , just the cream , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and about four avocados , which had , compared to ice cream , about three times the fat and the same amount of saturated fat and calories .\nWhat did the researchers find ?\nIf you eat the ice cream , just the cream ( the sugar-free components ) , or just the sugar ( the fat-free components ) , the level of oxidative stress in the bloodstream goes up .\nBut , this was not observed after ingestion of a calorie-equivalent whole plant food .\n\u201c Unlike ice cream , ingestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same energy density [ calories ] and a similar amount of fat , did not produce a rise in oxidative or inflammatory activity .\nThis suggests that the postprandial [ after-meal ] oxidative stress observed after eating foods such as ice cream may be due to their isolation from non-energy-producing food components such as antioxidants.\n\u201d Sugar is okay in fruit form because it naturally comes prepackaged with phytonutrients .\nSimilarly , the fat in whole plant foods like nuts and avocados comes prepackaged with \u201c a rich matrix of phytochemicals [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same potential for oxidative damage.\n\u201d Want to read more from How Not to Die ?\nPlease do !\nAll proceeds I receive from my books are donated to charity .\nI also mentioned Flashback Friday : The Effects of Avocados and Red Wine on Meal-Induced Inflammation .\n\u2022 Adding avocado to a burger blunts the spike in inflammation that normally occurs within hours of eating meat .\nDespite the avocado adding more fat and calories to the meal , less inflammation is produced , likely because the additions are from antioxidant-rich whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation .\n\u2022 Most of our waking hours may be in a postprandial ( after-meal ) state , and the fat we eat may be crippling our artery function soon after consumption .\n\u2022 When two milkshakes with virtually the same amounts of calories , sugar , protein , fat , saturated fat , and fiber , but one included peanuts , a whole plant food containing thousands of phytonutrients , were given to subjects , within hours of drinking the non-peanut shake , artery function was diminished by 20 percent .\nWith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no significant drop in the ability of the arteries to relax and dilate normally , and walnuts may work even better .\n\u2022 In another study , researchers examined reactions to : ( 1 ) ice cream , ( 2 ) avocado , ( 3 ) just the fat and protein from the ice cream ( to separate out the sugar ) , and ( 4 ) just the amount of sugar in the ice cream ( to separate out the effects of the saturated butterfat ) .\nOxidative stress levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream , just the fat and protein from the ice cream , and just the sugar in the ice cream , but no increase was observed after eating the avocados .\n\u2022 Whole plant foods , which are rich in antioxidants , come naturally prepackaged with phytonutrients and do not show the same potential for oxidative damage .\nFor even more on avocados , check out : \u2022 None Are Avocados Good for Your Cholesterol ?\n\u2022 None Are Avocados Good for You ?\nPS : If you haven \u2019 t yet , @ @ @ @

level of 131 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to see it go down at least to 120 or even 110 .\nSo , blueberries alone may not cure you .\nHowever , the fact that you can get a clinically significant improvement in a killer disease just \u201c by the addition of a single dietary component \u201d to your diet is quite impressive .\nIs more better ?\nWhat about twice the dose ?\nMore like two cups of fresh blueberries a day .\nResearchers found the same kind of significant drop , as you can see at 2:09 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn \u2019 t seem to make the blueberries work any better .\nSo , one cup may be all we need .\nEven less than a cup may work too , but we don \u2019 t know because it \u2019 s never been tested .\nOverall , there have been five interventional studies to date on the effects of blueberry supplementation on blood pressure .\nPut all the studies together , and the results do not show any clinical efficacy .\nWait , how could this be the case ?\nI just discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHave I been cherry-picking studies\u2014or rather , berry-picking them ?\nIf you read the papers closely , the blueberries in the two studies that detected a significant effect were prepared with water .\nThe researchers simply mixed the blueberry powder with water .\n\u201c However , the blueberries in the non-significant effect were prepared with yogurt and skim milk-based smoothie\u2026 \u201d You may remember from a video I produced about eight years ago , Nutrient-Blocking Effects of Dairy , that discussed how the absorption of berry nutrients can be blocked by dairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you mix strawberries with water , you get a nice peak in strawberry phytonutrients in your bloodstream within hours of consumption .\nBut , if you instead go for strawberries with cream\u2014mixing the same amount of strawberries with milk instead of water\u2014significantly less of their phytonutrients make it into your system .\n\u201c The inhibitory effects of milk may be due to\u2026interaction of anthocyanins [ the berry pigments ] and milk proteins.\n\u201d Does milk make the same thing happen with blueberries ?\nIndeed , the antioxidant activity of blueberries was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study , volunteers ate a cup and a half of blueberries with either water or milk .\nAs you can see at 3:48 in my video , the milk blocked the absorption of some phytonutrients , but not others .\nSo , did it really matter that much ?\nAfter consuming blueberries with water , there were spikes in the antioxidants found in the bloodstream , but fewer with milk .\nWhen you look at the total antioxidant capacity of the bloodstream , you see that if you eat blueberries with water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour and remains elevated five hours later .\nWith milk , you \u2019 d think there might be less of a bump .\nIn fact , there wasn \u2019 t just less of a bump , but less overall\u2014less than where the study participants had even started out !\nThe study subjects ate a whole bowl of blueberries and ended up with less antioxidant capacity just because they ate them with milk .\nNo wonder mixing blueberries with yogurt or milk may abolish the blood pressure\u2013lowering benefits .\nInterestingly , full-fat milk may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what one finds by adding milk to tea .\nWe \u2019 re talking about twice the reduction in in vitro antioxidant values with whole milk compared with skim milk , which is odd because we always thought it was the milk protein that was the culprit .\nThis , however , suggests there may be some nutrient-blocking involvement from the dairy fat as well .\n\u2022 Three Harvard studies followed more than a hundred thousand women for a decade and found that those consuming the most berries ( and thereby the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) each day had an 8 percent lower risk of developing high blood pressure , and the quantities were only about 6 strawberries or 11 blueberries a day .\n\u2022 Even after controlling for other factors , such

happened in states after medical marijuana laws were passed ?\nDid opioid overdoses go up , stay the same , or go down ?\nMillions of people in the United States have been diagnosed with an opioid use disorder , and more than 80 Americans die each day from opioid overdose .\nWhere is this coming from ?\nMost \u201c new heroin users started out misusing opioid prescription painkillers.\n\u201d This is important because more than 200 million opioid painkiller prescriptions are still written every year .\nDid you catch that number ?\nTwo hundred million prescriptions every year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire adult population in the United States.\n\u201d That \u2019 s incredible .\n\u201c \u2018 When you see something like the opioid addiction crisis blossoming in so many states around this country , the last thing we should be doing is encouraging people \u2019 to smoke cannabis , [ White House Spokesperson Sean ] Spicer told reporters.\n\u201d But , if opioid addiction starts with people taking prescription pain pills , maybe cannabis would reduce the problem by offering a substitute painkiller .\nAlternatively , maybe cannabis would act like a \u201c gateway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to harder drugs , potentially making the opioid epidemic worse , as I discuss in my video Marijuana Legalization and the Opioid Epidemic .\nWell , first , does cannabis work ?\n\u201c Is it a truly effective drug for pain that is arbitrarily stigmatized by many and criminalized by the federal government ?\nOr is it without any medical utility , its advocates hiding behind a screen of misplaced ( or deliberately misleading ) compassion for the ill ?\n\u201d The official position of the American Medical Association is that marijuana \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical use for preventing or treating any disease , \u201d but what does the science say ?\n\u201c Despite the widespread use of opioids , 50 % \u2013 80 % of advanced cancer patients die with unmet pain-relief needs.\n\u201d So , adding cannabis may help .\nIndeed , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trials have found that cannabis compounds do produce pain relief , \u201c equivalent to moderate doses of codeine , \u201d an opioid used to treat mild to moderate pain , but if you \u2019 re dying from cancer , don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nWhy not just crank up the morphine ?\nIf you wanted , you could put someone in coma and erase all their pain , but there \u2019 s a very real problem with such high doses of opiates : Here you are , at the end of life , surrounded by loved ones , but you \u2019 re so doped up you can \u2019 t even say goodbye .\nThis is where cannabis may help .\nIt may allow patients to drop down the opiate dose a bit without compromising pain control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyway .\nIf you look at New England , for example , which can be thought of as ground zero for the opioid epidemic , in just one year , \u201c there were enough opioids dispensed from Maine pharmacies in 2014 to supply every person in the state with a 16-day supply.\n\u201d What are they doing up there ?\nAmong the New Englanders surveyed who were on opioids , however , most claimed \u201c they reduced their [ opioid ] use since they started MC , \u201d medical cannabis .\nSome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol , anti-anxiety medications , migraine meds , and sleeping pills .\nForty percent said they were able to reduce their opioid use \u201c a lot , \u201d as you can see at 3:16 in my video .\nCannabis use may even reduce the use of crack cocaine .\nIt may seem strange to give drugs to drug addicts , but if people even make a partial switch from more to less harmful drugs , overall harm may be reduced .\nSo , what happened after medical marijuana laws were passed ?\nDid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , or go down ?\nThey went down .\n\u201c Medical cannabis laws are associated with significantly lower state-level opioid overdose mortality rates , \u201d about a 25 percent lower rate of overdose deaths .\n\u201c The striking implication is that medical marijuana laws\u2026may represent a promising approach for stemming \u201d the opioid overdose epidemic .\n\u201c If true , this finding upsets the applecart of conventional wisdom regarding the public health implications of marijuana legalization and medicinal usefulness.\n\u201d On the one hand , we have the AMA saying cannabis isn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , if people are getting enough benefit using it so they can cut down on their prescriptions , then obviously something is going on .\nWhat about other prescription drugs ?\nAs you can see at 4:37 in my video , once medical marijuana laws were passed , fewer people were filling prescriptions\u2014and not only fewer prescriptions for painkillers , but fewer prescriptions for anti-anxiety drugs , antidepressants , anti-nausea drugs , antipsychotics , anti-seizure drugs , and sleeping pills .\nIf all states adopted medical marijuana laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars a year .\nBut , the half-billion dollars taxpayers would save , is the half-billion bucks drug companies would lose , so it \u2019 s no wonder Big Pharma is freaking out .\nWhy do you think pharmaceutical corporations , including the makers of OxyContin and Vicodin , were major sponsors of the marijuana prohibition lobby , trying to stop legalization ?\n\u201c Other major sponsors of marijuana prohibition were the beer industry , police unions , and the private prison industry.\n\u201d \u2022 More than 200 million opioid painkiller prescriptions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States with an opioid use disorder and more than 80 Americans dying every day from opioid overdose .\n\u2022 Might cannabis act as a gateway to harder drugs , like opioids , or might it reduce opioid addiction by offering a substitute painkiller to prescription pills ?\n\u2022 The American Medical Association \u2019 s official position is that marijuana \u201c has no scientifically proven , currently accepted medical use for preventing or treating any disease , \u201d but studies have found that cannabis compounds produce pain relief \u201c equivalent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opioid used to treat mild to moderate pain .\n\u2022 At the end of life , cannabis may allow patients to reduce opiate doses without compromising pain relief such that they may not be in such a drug-induced stupor that they can not say goodbye .\n\u2022 Most New Englanders taking opioids claimed they reduced their opioid use after starting medical cannabis , and some also reduced use of alcohol , antidepressants , sleeping pills , and anti-anxiety and migraine medications .\nCannabis may also reduce use of crack cocaine .\n\u2022 After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overdoses went down , about a 25 percent lower rate of opioid overdose deaths , and fewer people were filling prescriptions\u2014not only for painkillers , but also for anti-anxiety drugs , antidepressants , anti-nausea drugs , antipsychotics , anti-seizure drugs , and sleeping pills .\n\u2022 About half a billion dollars would be saved annually if medical marijuana laws were adopted across the United States , but the half-billion taxpayers would save is the half-billion drug companies would lose .\nI have a whole treasure chest of cannabis videos , which you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2022 None The Institute of Medicine Report on the Health Effects of Marijuana \u2022 None Does

calcium supplement preparations , \u201d and testing has revealed continued public health concern over bonemeal .\nThankfully , bonemeal isn \u2019 t as popular these days , so most of us aren \u2019

United States , five billion pounds of meat and bonemeal are produced annually as slaughterhouse by-products .\nWhat do we do with these millions of tons every year ?\nWe feed it back to farm animals

.\nThis kind of recycling not only magnifies prions , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including lead .\nSo a more plant-based diet may be able to lower lead exposure , and an even more plant-based diet could theoretically lower exposure even more .\nWhat happens when you put it to the test ?\nShould we really expect to find a benefit ?\nAs you can see at 1:42 in my video , even though lead is one of the toxins found in meat , half of our dietary exposure probably comes from plant foods .\nIn fact , dietary modeling studies in Europe suggest that vegetarians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of lead compared to the general population , with the exception of those who eat a lot of wild game , which can have a thousand times more lead than most other foods , as you can see at 2:02 in my video .\nA vegetarian

the huge number of mobile [ cell ] phone users at present days , even simple adverse health effects could have major implications.\n\u201d \u201c The major concern about cell phones is that they are usually held close to the head , resulting in significant exposure to the brain and other tissues on the side of the head where the phone is usually placed.\n\u201d Other tissues ?\nYes , such as your inner ear , the organ most frequently and directly exposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adverse effects on hearing ?\nIn fact , the ear canal \u201c may provide a natural route by which emitted radiofrequency radiations may reach the peripheral and central nervous system , \u201d going deeper into your skull .\nA first natural question to ask might be : Do long-term cell phone users have worse hearing ?\nApparently , they do .\nCell phone users were found to have detectable hearing loss , though not enough to be noticeable , suggesting long-term cell phone use might damage the inner ear .\nThe damage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which may be more consistent with a radiation effect than simply a constant loud-noise-in-one-ear effect .\nNow , this was comparing users to complete nonusers .\nAs you can see at 1:20 in my video The Effect of Cell Phones and Bluetooth on Nerve Function , if you compare heavy cell phone users to light users , there appears to be a dose response : the longer the duration

clearly revealed hazardous effects of mobile phone use on auditory function.\n\u201d They went on to say that \u201c based on the study , it is recommend to use mobile [ cell ] phones very judiciously , \u201d as there does not appear to be any difference between non-users and those who just used it 10 to 20 minutes a day .\nTwo hours a day , however , did appear to be associated with a certain amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure to electromagnetic ( EM ) field generated by cellular phones.\n\u201d But , to make a claim like that , you can \u2019 t just use observational studies like these .\nYou need to put it to the test .\nAs you can see at 2:13 in my video , to determine if cell phone signals could affect the auditory nerve at all , for five minutes , researchers directly exposed the nerve to a cell phone hovering right over it\u2014in the middle of brain surgery\u2014and saw a dramatic deterioration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to such an extent that they decided to stop the experiment early \u201c to avoid possible permanent damage to the auditory structures.\n\u201d Obviously , this is a very unnatural situation that is \u201c clearly far from reproducing the real-life EMF \u201d exposure you would have with skin , bone , blood , brain , and the like in the way .\nIt does , however , show that cell phone emissions are powerful enough to at least potentially affect nerve function .\nHow about an interventional study on the effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t involve brain surgery and where your skull is actually on ?\nThe first study on this ever published found that ten minutes of cell phone exposure had no effect .\nSo far , so good .\nWhat about longer than ten minutes ?\nResearchers found no effect at 15 , 20 , or even 30 minutes , but what about after an hour ?\n\u201c Sixty minutes of close exposure to electromagnetic fields emitted by a mobile phone \u201d did appear to immediately impact hearing threshold levels at specific frequencies .\nAgain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent you would notice a difference in your hearing , but it was enough to be picked up on these hearing tests .\nWhat if you wear a Bluetooth headset ?\nDoes Bluetooth radiation affect hearing ?\nApparently , it has no effect\u2026on your pet rat\u2026but what about the other members of your family ?\n\u201c Thirty adult volunteers were exposed to a Bluetooth headset device ( 1 ) on \u2018 standby \u2019 setting for 6 hours and ( 2 ) at full power for 10 minutes.\n\u201d Researchers detected no changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissions just don \u2019 t have the power to affect nerves ?\nToo bad that brain-surgery research group didn \u2019 t try waving around some Bluetooth headsets , too .\nOh , but they did !\nAfter showing that cell phone electromagnetic fields could deteriorate nerve impulses , the researchers decided to repeat the experiment to see if the same happened with Bluetooth fields .\nBluetooth operates at a higher frequency than cell phones , so , at the same power , Bluetooth might be more hazardous , but it also operates at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No surprise then that the Bluetooth device had no effect on the auditory nerve , even when it was completely exposed .\n\u201c Taken together , these findings indicate that the alternative offered by a Bluetooth headset coupled with a cell phone kept in a pocket or on a table is generally safer in terms of EMF effects on the nervous system and therefore represents a viable solution for safer [ cell phone ] operation.\n\u201d This is part of my extended series on cell phone radiation .\nYou may wonder why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it doesn \u2019 t have anything to do with food .\nWell , like nutrition , it has multibillion-dollar industries vying to distort the science , so I wanted to help people sort fact from fiction .\nI produced a series on mammograms for the same reason .\nCheck out : \u2022 None Nine Out of Ten Women Misinformed about Mammograms \u2022 Flashback Friday : Should Women Get Mammograms Starting at Age

to the head , the brain and other tissues , such as the inner ear , may be directly and significantly exposed to their radiation .\nAs well , cell phone users have been found to have detectable

Your Chia Seeds", "content": "The secret to unlocking the benefits of chia seeds may be grinding them up .\nWhen recently reviewing the literature on the health-promoting properties and therapeutic applications of chia seeds , I ran into a lot of studies discussing , for example , \u201c strategies for incorporation of chia ( Salvia hispanica L. ) in frankfurters as a health-promoting ingredient.\n\u201d After all , \u201c recent years have seen increasing pursuit of healthier lifestyles , among them dietary habits .\nIn response to this , there has been a great deal of interest worldwide in\u2026compounds originally present in plants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in hot dogs ?\nAnd , indeed , \u201c reformulated frankfurters with chia contained significantly greater amounts of [ plant ] proteins , insoluble dietary fiber , [ and ] minerals\u2026.Given this nutritional profile , the products thus produced could qualify for labelling with a variety of nutrition and health claims.\n\u201d And , what do you know ?\n\u201c Chia oil\u2013enriched restructured pork \u201d actually does affect \u201c aged rats \u201d fed bad diets .\nSo\u2026let \u2019 s slap on that health claims label !\nChia has been eaten for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s at least safe to consume , but does it offer any special benefits ?\nIt \u2019 s certainly nutritious .\nChia seed has a lot of fiber , antioxidants ( black chia seeds perhaps more than white ) , and plant protein , and also contains a lot of B vitamins and minerals .\nSo , yes , it \u2019 s nutritious\u2014like nearly any whole plant food .\nBut , again : Does it have any special benefits ?\nPeople trying to sell you chia seeds make all sorts of claims , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficial effects , \u201d we need a little something called \u201c scientific evidence instead of cultural traditions , personal beliefs , or even inaccurate advertising , \u201d a redundant term if I \u2019 ve ever heard one .\nFor example , if you look on YouTube , you \u2019 ll find more than 50,000 videos on chia seeds and belly fat , but what does the science say ?\nApparently , dietary chia seeds do reduce belly fat\u2026in rats .\nThey also reduce the weight\u2026of chickens .\nEvidently , \u201c consumers are reluctant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like fish , \u201d so by feeding chickens chia seeds , you can boost their omega-3 levels without turning the meat into funky chicken .\nWhat happens if you just cut out the middlehen and eat chia yourself ?\nI discuss this in my video Do Chia Seeds Help with Belly Fat ?\n.\nWhat happens , for instance , if you add a teaspoon or two of chia seeds to yogurt as a snack ?\nAfter eating yogurt with chia , \u201c participants reported significantly lower scores for hunger \u201d and ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours later .\nMy initial thought was , well , duh\u2014if you give people more food by adding chia to whatever they \u2019 re eating , then of course they \u2019 ll be less hungry .\nBut , as you can see at 2:44 in my video , the researchers gave the subjects less yogurt to compensate for the addition of chia , so each snack had the same number of calories .\nWhat happened at lunch two hours later ?\nThe study participants didn \u2019 t just eat a little less food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calories after the chia .\nA teaspoon of chia seeds only has around 50 calories , and subjects ended up eating nearly 300 fewer calories at lunch , so that \u2019 s way more than just compensating .\nWe can at least say that chia seeds are more satiating than yogurt .\nSo , if you ate some chia seeds every day as a snack\u2014one teaspoon seemed to work as well as two\u2014you \u2019 d expect to lose weight over time .\nYou don \u2019 t know , though , until you\u2026put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a whole tablespoon of chia seed twice a day before their first and last meal for 12 weeks , and the researchers found that \u201c [ c ] hia seed does not promote weight loss \u201d after all .\nThat \u2019 s disappointing .\nWell , we know from the flaxseed literature that if you give people muffins made out of whole flax seeds , they don \u2019 t seem to really absorb all the benefit compared to ground flaxseed muffins .\nThe same appears to be true with chia seeds .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ my video , if you eat whole chia seeds for ten weeks , there \u2019 s no increase in short-chain omega 3 levels or long-chain omega 3s .\nBut , if you eat the same amount of ground chia seeds , levels shoot up .\nSo , maybe the problem with that study is that the researchers gave people whole chia seeds .\nWhat we really need is a study on ground chia and weight loss , and researchers gave us just that .\nIn a randomized controlled trial , one group was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day , and another group got a fiber-matched control made of mostly oat bran .\nThis is how you know it wasn \u2019 t funded by a chia seed company : The researchers pitted the chia head-to-head against a real control to match the fiber content instead of just putting it up against a sugar pill .\nThat way , if there were weight loss , we \u2019 d know it wasn \u2019 t due just to the fiber , but something particular to the chia .\nAnd , indeed , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video , those eating the ground chia lost significantly more weight and significantly more waist in terms of waist circumference , which is a measure of belly fat , and , as a bonus , had a decrease in their c-reactive protein levels , suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect as well .\nSo , maybe some of those 50,000 YouTube videos aren \u2019 t completely off .\nThere is one form of chia powder I \u2019 d stay away from , though .\nIn a previous video , Which Are Better : Chia Seeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using chia gel to replace eggs or oil in baking , by mixing a teaspoon of chia seeds with a quarter cup of water and letting it sit for a half an hour .\nIt \u2019 s certainly a way to lower cholesterol and skipping the eggs seems like it would cut down your Salmonella risk , but there was an international outbreak of Salmonella linked to sprouted chia seed powder that infected 94 people across 16 U.S. states and 4 Canadian provinces .\nSprouting can \u201c create an ideal environment for bacterial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as bad as Salmonella-tainted eggs , which may sicken 79,000 Americans every year , but I would still recommend staying away from sprouted chia seed powder .\n\u2022 Chia ( Salvia hispanica ) has been eaten for thousands of years and has a lot of fiber , antioxidants ( black chia seeds perhaps more than white ) , protein , B vitamins , and minerals .\n\u2022 Myriad claims have been made about chia seeds \u2019 special benefits , such as reducing belly fat .\nIn fact , more than 50,000 videos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YouTube .\n\u2022 From the flaxseed literature , we know benefits are absorbed better when eating ground flax than whole flax , and the same appears to be true with chia seeds .\n\u2022 In a randomized controlled trial , researchers gave one group about two daily tablespoons of ground chia and another group got a fiber-matched control made mostly of oat bran .\nThose in the ground chia group lost significantly more weight and significantly more waist in terms of waist circumference , which is a measure of belly fat , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c-reactive protein levels , which suggests an anti-inflammatory effect .\n\u2022 In a previous video , Which Are Better : Chia Seeds or Flaxseeds ?\n, I talked about using chia gel ( mixing a teaspoon of chia seeds with a quarter cup of water and letting it sit for a half an hour ) instead of eggs or oil in baking .\nThis helps to lower cholesterol and may reduce your Salmonella risk by omitting eggs , but there was an international Salmonella outbreak linked to sprouted chia seed powder , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed powder .\nFor more on flax , check out : \u2022 None How Well Does Cooking Destroy the Cyanide in Flaxseeds ?\nRisk of Salmonella is another reason

water to boost your mood !\nAnyway , I \u2019 m reading all the studies , so you don \u2019 t have to .\nThat \u2019 s my job !\nSo what does the study actually say ?\nIt starts out saying that \u201c plants are frequently tested for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , so good .\n\u201c Therefore young coconut water , a commonly used plant based beverage , was selected to explore its antidepressant potential.\n\u201d Okay , still with you .\nSo , \u201c rodents were selected for this study and forced swim test was conducted to explore antidepressant activity.\n\u201d What ?\n!\nThe forced swim

depressive disorders \u201d in people .\nWhat ?\n!\nIt depresses me to even read such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even get this idea ?\nIt was invented by a group of French scientists in the Seventies to model \u201c behavioral despair.\n\u201d That reminds me of the Harlow experiments , which involved vertical chamber confinement that he called \u201c the pit of despair.\n\u201d It was essentially a metal contraption with sloped sides , as you can see at 2:15 in my video .\nIf you lock a baby monkey inside of it for 45 days , you can produce \u201c profound and persistent behavioral abnormalities of a depressive nature in monkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fetal position , hugging themselves , as you can see at 2:24 in my video .\nAfter ten weeks alone in the chamber , they exhibit behaviors like the \u201c contact cling , \u201d where they just come together and hug each other for long periods of time .\n\u201c It is not yet clear why confinement in the vertical chamber is apparently so effective in producing abnormal behavior\u2026 [ but ] studies are now underway , \u201d so don \u2019 t you worry .\nI \u2019 ll spare you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on puppies .\nI can see why you \u2019 d want to test out new antidepressant drugs , but if you want to figure out if pomegranates have anti-depressant effects , why not just feed people some pomegranates , rather than throwing some mice into the deep end in a forced swimming test ?\nThere are literally thousands of published studies on food or food products using this forced swim test .\nThey allow the egg industry , for example , to say things like \u201c whole egg may be an excellent food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major depression.\n\u201d Why ?\nBecause rats struggled longer after being fed eggs before they were forced to swim ?\nIn people , however , removing eggs from the diet improves mood\u2014though , the researchers also removed meat from their diet , so it \u2019 s not clear which did what .\nIt \u2019 s also possible the subjects were just eating more healthful plant foods , like soy .\nIn fact , the soy industry is happy to tell you soy \u201c decreases depressive-related behavior \u201d \u2026in postmenopausal rats , who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced swim test .\nIn people , though , the best soy products may be able to do is simply work as well as drugs like Prozac and Zoloft , as you can see at 3:57 in my video , and we all know how little that actually says .\nI mean , the forced swim test is just \u201c a reaction to the acute stressful stimulus of being placed in a container without an escape route , and human depression reflects a chronic subjective emotional state rather than a reaction to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is\u2026 [ an ] internal emotional state and , to date , the subjective internal emotional state of

macadamia nuts around 200 .\nEven chocolate has about twice as many phytosterols as avocados , as you can see at 0:51 in my video Are Avocados Good for Your Cholesterol ?\n.\nEven though nuts and seeds have such high levels of phytosterols , the studies that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cholesterol with phytosterols have used supplements starting with 600 milligrams and going up into the thousands of milligrams .\nSo , yes , you can lower LDL cholesterol by about 8 percent with a dose of phytosterols around 2,100 milligrams , but that would be about 20 avocados a day , as you can see at 1:17 in my video .\nAnd 2,100 milligrams of phytosterols would also be a lot of nuts , but you can get an 8 percent drop in LDL by just eating a palmful of nuts , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see in the graph below and at 1:36 in my video .\nSo , phytosterols aren \u2019 t the only components of nuts responsible for driving down cholesterol .\nNuts must have other components , perhaps fiber or other phytonutrients , that contribute to their cholesterol-lowering effects .\nMight avocados have such components , too ?\nYou don \u2019 t know until\u2026you put it to the test .\nAs you can see in the figure below and at 2:10 in my video , there are studies dating back more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you add an avocado to people \u2019 s daily diets , their cholesterol drops .\nWhen you remove the daily avocados , however , their cholesterol goes back up , and then it drops down again when you add the avocados back in .\nThe data are pretty convincing\u2014until you see how the study was done

it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cholesterol and being on or off lard .\nAnd , nearly all of the studies on cholesterol and avocados are similarly designed .\nWhat happened when researchers performed a meta-analysis of ten studies involving hundreds of people ?\nWhen they put them all together and looked at the results , what did they find ?\nIt appears that adding avocados led to a significant drop in cholesterol and triglycerides\u2014an average of about a 17-point drop in bad LDL cholesterol .\nBut , once again , nearly all of the studies were substitution studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people \u2019 s diets and avocados were substituted in .\nIf you cut down on saturated animal fat , your cholesterol will drop .\nYou can tell this meta-analysis was not funded by the avocado industry because the

benefit.\n\u201d Indeed , simply adding avocado may confer no benefits to cholesterol at all .\nSo , yes , the avocado industry is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more healthful substitute for butter , margarine , cheese , or cream cheese , but that \u2019 s a pretty low bar .\nWhat Are the Worst Foods for High Cholesterol ?\nAccording to William C.

beta-carotene , are fat-soluble .\n\u2022 and other whole grains \u2022 None Compared with all other fruits , avocados contain more phytosterols , the cholesterol-lowering nutrient found in plant

How Much Rice Is Too Much?", "date": "2022-06-27", "source": "nutritionfactsorg", "title": "Is There Arsenic in Rice? How Much Rice Is Too Much?", "content": "Concerns over the arsenic content of rice have led to recommendations to reduce rice consumption in favor of other whole grains .\nWhat are some strategies to reduce arsenic exposure from rice ?\nArsenic , a naturally occurring element , has been designated as a category one carcinogen , which is the highest level .\nMost of the arsenic in the American diet may come from meat .\nDrugs containing arsenic are often fed to farm animals to kill their intestinal parasites .\nDuring the cooking process , the arsenic residues in their flesh can convert to inorganic arsenic that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat .\nArsenic accumulates , along with many other banned chemicals , and slaughterhouse byproducts can be recycled as animal feed .\nFish may also have high levels of arsenic .\nIn fact , arsenic is used as a biomarker for total fish and seafood intake .\nOne type of seaweed , hijiki ( also commonly spelled as hiziki ) , absorbs so much arsenic from the sea water that it is not safe to eat .\nThe Ayurvedic medicine triphala has been found to be contaminated with arsenic , lead , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be avoided .\nHow Much Arsenic Is in Rice ?\nRice accumulates ten times more arsenic than other grains , which helps explain why the arsenic levels in urine samples of those who eat rice tend to be consistently higher than those who do not eat rice , as you can see below and at 2:18 in my video .\nWhen the Food and Drug Administration tested a few dozen samples of quinoa , for example , most had arsenic levels below the level of detection or just trace amounts , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s favorite .\nThere were , however , still a few that were up around half the arsenic content of rice .\nBut , overall , quinoa averaged ten times less toxic arsenic than rice .\nWhich Rice Has Less Arsenic ?\nBrown rice may contain more arsenic than white rice , but does our body absorb it the same no matter the source ?\nFor arsenic to get from rice into our bladder , it must be absorbed through our gut into the bloodstream .\nTo investigate absorption , researchers measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of participants who ate white rice compared to those who ate brown rice .\nArsenic is in the air , in the water , and in nearly all foods , so even those who don \u2019 t eat rice at all still eliminate about eight micrograms of toxic , carcinogenic arsenic in their urine each day .\nBut , eating just one cup or more of white rice a day increases your arsenic exposure by 65 percent .\nWhat about brown rice , which technically contains even more arsenic than white rice ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown rice elevates your exposure the same 65 percent .\nIndeed , researchers found no difference between the urine arsenic levels of participants eating white or brown rice .\nNow , this was not an interventional study , where subjects are fed the same amount of rice to see what happened , which would have been ideal .\nThis was a population study .\nSo , maybe the reason the arsenic levels are the same is that people eat greater quantities of white rice than brown rice .\nCheck out my video Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown , Red , White , or Wild for data on all rice types .\nWho Is Most at Risk ?\nThose who are exposed to the most arsenic in rice are those who are exposed to the most rice , like people who are eating plant-based , gluten-free , or dairy-free .\nSo , at-risk populations are not just infants and pregnant women , but all who may tend to eat more rice .\nIt \u2019 s a difficult reality that some who may try to be health conscious by avoiding dairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as brown rice , may not only face some theoretical increased lifetime cancer risk , but actually suffer arsenic poisoning .\nA 39-year-old woman , for instance , had celiac disease so she avoided wheat , barley , and rye .\nShe incorporated so much rice into her diet that she ended up with sky-high arsenic levels and had some typical symptoms , including diarrhea , insomnia , abnormal taste , loss of appetite , headache , and impaired short-term memory and concentration .\nAs I discuss in my video How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we should keep an eye out for signs of arsenic exposure in those who eat a lot of rice day in and day out .\nHow Much Rice Should You Consume ?\nAs you can see in the table below and at 1:08 in my video , in its 2012 arsenic-in-rice expos\u00e9 , Consumer Reports recommended adults eat no more than an average of two servings of rice a week or three servings a week of rice cereal or rice pasta .\nIn its later analysis , however , it looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have much more inorganic arsenic\u2014a carcinogen\u2014than [ its ] 2012 data showed , \u201d so Consumer Reports dropped its recommendation down from three weekly servings to a maximum of only two servings a week\u2014and that \u2019 s only if you aren \u2019 t getting arsenic from other rice sources .\nIn the chart below and at 1:29 in my video , you can see the point system that Consumer Reports came up with , letting people add up all of their rice products each week to make sure they \u2019 re staying under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf your only source of rice is rice , for example , then it recommends no more than one or two servings for the whole week .\nI recommend at least 21 servings of whole grains a week in my Daily Dozen , though , so what to do ?\nGet to know sorghum , quinoa , buckwheat , millet , oatmeal , barley , or any of the other non-rice whole grains out there .\nThey tend to have negligible levels of toxic arsenic .\nHow to Reduce Arsenic Exposure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy to reduce exposure of arsenic in rice .\nWe can also consider alternatives to rice , especially for infants , and minimize our exposure by cooking rice as we do pasta , with plenty of extra water that is poured off after cooking .\nWe found that a 10:1 water-to-rice ratio seemed best.. We can also avoid processed foods sweetened with brown rice syrup .\nWhat else can we do while waiting for federal agencies to establish some regulatory limits ?\nWhat if you eat a lot of fiber-containing foods with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the arsenic ?\nApparently not .\nIn one study , the presence of fat did seem to have an effect , but in the wrong direction : Fat increased estimates of arsenic absorption , likely due to the extra bile we release when we eat fatty foods .\nWe know that the tannic acid in coffee and especially in tea can reduce iron absorption , which is why I recommend not drinking tea with meals , but might it also decrease arsenic absorption ?\nYes , perhaps by 40 percent or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be helpful , but they used mega doses\u2014the amount found in 17 cups of tea or 34 cups of coffee\u2014so it isn \u2019 t really practical .\nWhat do experts suggest ?\nWell , arsenic levels are lower in rice from certain regions , like California and parts of India , so why not blend that with some of the higher arsenic rice to even things out for everybody ?\nWhat ?\n!\nHow is that a reasonable suggestion ?\nAnother wonky , thinking-outside-the-rice-box idea involves an algae discovered in the hot springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enzyme that can volatize arsenic into a gas .\nResearchers genetically engineered that gene into a rice plant and were able to get a little arsenic gas off of it , but the rice industry is hesitant .\n\u201c Posed with a choice between [ genetically engineered ] rice and rice with arsenic in it , consumers may decide they just aren \u2019 t going to eat any rice \u201d at all .\nA better option ?\nBoiling and draining rice as with pasta may lower arsenic levels .\nCheck out optimal cooking @ @

blood sugar-lowering ] , immuno-regulation , and anti-cancer.\n\u201d What they don \u2019 t tell you up front , however , is that they \u2019 re talking about reducing ammonia-induced mouse coughs .\nWhat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with anti-pancreatic cancer properties \u201d ?\nIndeed , monk fruit \u201c may be used for daily consumption as an additive in foods and drinks to prevent or treat pancreatic cancer \u201d \u2014in your pet mouse .\nThere was a study conducted on the \u201c antiproliferative activity of triterpene glycoside nutrient from monk fruit in colorectal cancer and throat cancer , \u201d but it was on colorectal and throat cancer cells in a petri dish .\nAs you can see at 1:53 in my video , researchers did show mogrosides killing off colorectal cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our

non-nutritive sweeteners ] would be a healthier alternative to sugar and artificial NNS for consumers.\n\u201d So , researchers randomized people to drink beverages sweetened with either aspartame , monk fruit , stevia , or table sugar .\nThey then measured blood sugars over 24 hours and found there was no significant difference amongst any of the four sweeteners .\nWait a second .\nAs you can

40 points over the next hour .\nIf you \u2019 re given a beverage sweetened with aspartame , monk fruit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThat \u2019 s to be expected , right ?\nThose are non-caloric sweeteners without any calories , so isn \u2019 t it just like drinking water ?\nIn that case , how could your daily blood sugar values average out the same as drinking the sugar-sweetened drink ?\nThe only way that could happen is if the non-calorie sweeteners somehow made your blood sugar spikes worse later in the day .\nIndeed , when people drink Splenda mixed with sugar water , they get a greater blood sugar spike and a greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Splenda ) than without , even though Splenda alone causes no spike of its own , as you can see at 4:04 in my video .\nWhat about aspartame ?\nDoes it do the same thing ?\nAt the one-hour mark , the researchers fed the study participants a regular lunch , and their blood sugars went back up and down as they normally would after a meal .\nIn the sugar group , their post-lunch levels didn \u2019 t spike as high as they did an hour earlier when they drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just a gentle up and down .\nIn the aspartame group , however , even though their blood sugars didn \u2019 t rise at the time they drank the aspartame-sweetened beverage , their blood sugars shot up higher , an hour later at lunch , as if they had just drank a bottle of soda .\nWhat about the natural sweeteners ?\nWhat happened in the stevia and monk fruit groups ?\nThe same thing happened .\nThere was the same exaggerated blood sugar spike after a regular meal eaten an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , remember , this despite the fact that the three non-caloric sweetener groups\u2014aspartame , stevia , and monk fruit\u2014took in 16 fewer spoonsful of sugar .\nSo , you can see how it all equals out in terms of average blood sugars , at least in part because those in the non-caloric sweetener groups ate more .\nAfter drinking a Diet Coke , you \u2019 re more likely to eat more at your next meal than after drinking a regular Coke .\nIn fact , you \u2019 re likely to eat so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d from replacing sugar with non-caloric sweeteners is fully compensated for at subsequent meals , so there is no difference found in total daily calorie intake .\nThe sugar-sweetened beverage led to large spikes in both blood sugar and insulin , whereas these responses were higher for the three other beverages following the lunch eaten later .\nSo , when it comes to calorie intake , blood sugars , or insulin spikes , they were all just as bad .\nIs Stevia Good for You ?\nis the video I mentioned .\n\u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the billions and includes artificial sweeteners like aspartame and sucralose ( sold as Splenda ) , as well as two natural ones extracted from plants\u2014stevia and monk fruit ( Luo Han Guo ) .\n\u2022 Monk fruit has been used for centuries in China as both a natural sweetener and a folk medicine .\nThe non-caloric sweet taste has been estimated to be about 300 times as sweet as table sugar , and monk fruit has been said to be antitussive ( anti-coughing ) , anti-asthmatic , anti-cancer , and more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dish studies .\n\u2022 When researchers randomized human subjects to drink beverages sweetened with aspartame , monk fruit , stevia , or table sugar and then measured their blood sugars over 24 hours , no

the cause of dandruff shifted with a landmark article published in 1984 .\nInstead of relying on secondary sources , reviews , editorials , and opinion pieces , the author looked at the primary literature , the original studies .\nHe was \u201c amazed to find out how overwhelming was the evidence of aetiology , \u201d the true cause of dandruff , \u201c and how it had been ignored because it was so well buried under the mountain of error since Malassez ( 1874 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe now know that dandruff is triggered by a fungus that lives and feeds on the human scalp .\nThere are the two major implications : First , how \u201c alarming \u201d is it that a bogus theory can remain unchallenged in the medical literature for a century despite evidence to the contrary ?\nSecond , if it \u2019 s a fungus , what about trying tea tree oil , which contains components that have anti-fungal activity against a range of fungi .\nAs I discuss in my video Does Tea Tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Foot ?\n, the latter was an idea based on studies that found that tea tree oil in a petri dish can fight off pathogenic skin fungi , as you can see below and at 1:07 in my video .\nYou don \u2019 t know if it works for dandruff , though , until you put it to the test .\nOne hundred twenty-six men and women were randomized either to daily use of a 5 percent tea tree oil shampoo or a placebo for a month .\nAs you can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the placebo worked a little bit , decreasing dandruff severity by about 10 percent , but the tea tree oil shampoo worked better , decreasing dandruff severity by about 40 percent .\nIn the tea tree oil group , \u201c only one patient actually achieved a complete response , as did one patient in the placebo group .\nThus , it appears that 5 % tea tree shampoo would require ongoing application for control of dandruff.\n\u201d Speaking of fungus , what about tea tree oil in the treatment of athlete \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our most common fungal skin infection , affecting up to one in ten .\nAbout a hundred patients were randomized into one of three groups : a 10 percent tea tree oil cream , Tinactin ( an antifungal drug ) , or a placebo cream .\nAfter one month , the fungus was wiped out in 85 percent of the drug group , but only about a quarter of the placebo and tea tree oil groups were cured , as you can see below and at 2:31 in my video .\nThis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can kill off the fungus in a petri dish , but apparently , not on toes .\nThis reminds me of some of the oral health data on tea tree oil .\nStudies have shown it can wipe out some oral pathogens in a petri dish , but what happens if you have people swish a tea tree oil solution around in their mouth , compared with placebo and swishing with a medicated chlorhexidine mouthwash ?\nAfter four days without brushing their teeth , as with the placebo , the tea tree oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while swishing with the medicated mouthwash kept the plaque at bay a bit , as you can see below and at 2:56 in my video .\nSo , if tea tree oil doesn \u2019 t influence the amount of plaque , it presumably wouldn \u2019 t help with gingivitis , the gum inflammation that \u2019 s caused by plaque buildup .\nBut , no , here \u2019 s the twist .\nTrue , there is no reduction in plaque with a 2.5 percent tea tree oil gel , yet there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since decreased gingival [ gum ] inflammation occurred\u2026without a concomitant decrease in plaque scores , its mechanism of activity could have been anti-inflammatory rather than antibacterial.\n\u201d Might the same thing be happening in that athlete \u2019 s foot study I mentioned earlier ?\nFrom a mycological cure standpoint\u2014that is , a fungal cure standpoint\u2014tea tree oil didn \u2019 t really do any better than placebo .\nAnd , although the drug treatment wiped out the fungus in 85 percent of cases , some of those patients didn \u2019 t actually notice an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after using the drug , \u201c probably a reflection of the minor irritant side effect \u201d of Tinactin .\nIf , instead of mycological cure , you looked at symptom improvement , tea tree oil works as well as the drug , as you can see below and at 4:14 in my video .\n\u201c This may be the basis for the popular use of tea tree oil in the treatment of tinea pedis , \u201d athlete \u2019 s foot .\nPeople should realize , though , that it \u2019 s just symptomatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily eliminating the underlying cause .\nOf course , it \u201c is possible that a higher concentration of tea tree oil would have better antifungal properties and even better efficacy in the treatment of tinea pedis.\n\u201d And , indeed , instead of using a 10 percent tea tree oil cream , if you use one that \u2019 s 25 or 50 percent tea tree oil solution , you can get mycological cure rates above that of placebo , though still not as good as the drug .\nAt those high concentrations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applying tea tree oil developed moderate to severe dermatitis , \u201d breaking out in a rash .\nBut , if you have a patient who doesn \u2019 t want to use the medicated creams , then a 25 percent tea tree oil application has a decent chance of knocking out their athlete \u2019 s foot without being too risky , though the standard over-the-counter antifungal creams may work even better .\n\u2022 Tea tree oil contains components with anti-fungal activity against a range of different fungi .\n\u2022 Dandruff is triggered by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scalp .\nResearchers found that a 5 percent tea tree oil shampoo worked better than placebo in decreasing dandruff severity , 40 percent compared with 10 percent , respectively .\n\u2022 Athlete \u2019 s foot may be our most common fungal skin infection , but a 10 percent tea tree oil cream was not as effective a cure as Tinactin ( an antifungal drug ) .\nTinactin wiped out the fungus in 85 percent of the drug group , but only about a quarter of the placebo and tea tree oil groups were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil solution in the mouth doesn \u2019 t seem to have an effect on dental plaque buildup without toothbrushing , unlike medicated mouthwash , but it does appear to result in significant reduction in

the last 20 years , it follows that the main role of cytotoxic chemotherapy is in palliation.\n\u201d It can shrink tumors , relieving pain and pressure , but that doesn \u2019 t tend to translate into living any longer .\n\u201c The failure of therapy , coupled with the realization that the overwhelming majority of cancer is related to environmental , particularly lifestyle factors , dictates that prevention should be our foremost aim.\n\u201d Cancer is largely a preventable disease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOf the millions of cancer diagnoses every year , as many as 90 to 95 percent of the cancers are caused by lifestyle factors , with only 5 to 10 percent caused by bad genes .\nWe know this because of \u201c enormous differences in the incidence of particular forms of cancer in differing geographical and socio-economic situations \u201d around the world , which then change when people move from one place to another .\nFor example , as you can see below and at 2:40 in my video , breast cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the lowest rates in parts of Africa and Asia , until those Africans and Asians move and start eating and living like Americans , Argentinians , Europeans , or Australians .\nSo , \u201c there is need for a major reappraisal of how the problem of cancer is approached.\n\u201d The key to winning the war on cancer is prevention , which not only works better , but \u201c has the great advantage that it entails nothing worse than nicotine [ or jellybean ] withdrawal symptoms .\nOn the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often exposes the patient to much suffering , both physical and psychological .\nIndeed , some cancer treatments are considered worse than the disease.\n\u201d Most importantly , a healthy lifestyle can nip cancer in the bud , whereas , by definition , early diagnosis and treatment don \u2019 t change the cancer rate or the number of people getting cancer in the first place .\nIn terms of cancer prevention and treatment with nutrition , the \u201c consumption of nutrients of animal-based foods were associated with increased cancer risk while nutrients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk.\n\u201d It \u2019 s not enough just to avoid the bad stuff , though .\nEating is pretty much \u201c a zero-sum game.\n\u201d Everything we put in our mouth is a lost opportunity to put something even more healthful in our mouth .\nIt \u2019 s not just about avoiding foods with cancer-promoting properties .\nWe need to eat foods with active cancer-suppressing mechanisms .\nBy \u201c wholistic nutrition , \u201d we \u2019 re talking about whole foods , and we should get their nutrients not from extracts or pills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ultimately , \u201c cancer development is primarily a nutrition-responsive disease rather than a genetic disease , \u201d but ,

"nutritionfactsorg", "title": "Aloe Fails to Help Radiation Therapy Skin Burns", "content": "What are the effects of aloe on radiation burns caused by cancer treatment and on the cancer itself ?\n\u201c Worldwide attention was drawn to the possible value of gel prepared from Aloe arborescens [ aloe ] after the Second World War , when skin burns of victims of the nuclear bombs on Japan were successfully treated with its gel.\n\u201d You don \u2019 t really know for sure , though , until you put it to the test .\nAs I discuss in my video Aloe for the Treatment of Advanced Metastatic Cancer , most radiation burns today are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer .\nThese can cause \u201c severe , \u201d \u201c painful , \u201d and \u201c scarring \u201d skin reactions that can interfere with the therapy , but , sadly , we have yet to come up with good , \u201c well-established prophylactic skin treatment measures to prevent radiation skin toxicity.\n\u201d Enter aloe vera gel , which has been used on skin burns for centuries .\nSo what happened when a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial compared aloe vera gel versus a placebo gel ?\nNo benefit was found , as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my video .\nHowever , \u201c after the completion of this double blind trial study , many involved clinicians felt that the patients participating in this trial had less dermatitis \u201d \u2014or skin inflammation\u2014 \u201c than otherwise would have been expected .\nThis raised the question of whether the placebo gel was causing some benefit ( possibly due to skin lubrication ) .\n\u201d So , to their credit , they ran a second experiment to see if aloe was better than nothing at all , and , once again , aloe appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In both trials , the \u201c severity scores were virtually identical , \u201d meaning aloe vera gel simply didn \u2019 t work .\nIn an even larger trial , hundreds of patients were randomized to aloe vera gel or a plain skin lotion\u2014not only during the radiation treatments , but even extending for two weeks after their completion .\nThe result ?\nThe plain skin lotion placebo \u201c was significantly better than the aloe vera gel in reducing dry desquamation [ skin peeling ] and pain related to treatment.\n\u201d Yet again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review of all such studies shows there is simply \u201c no evidence from clinical trials to suggest that topical Aloe vera is effective \u201d or helpful .\nHead and neck cancer patients suffer the additional burden of radiation damage to the lining of their mouth and throat , and aloe didn \u2019 t seem to help with that either .\nOkay , so aloe may not help with cancer treatment , but what about helping with the cancer itself ?\nIn a petri dish , aloe \u201c inhibits proliferation of human breast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lung cancer cells , so is aloe vera \u201c a natural cancer soother \u201d ?\nUnfortunately , \u201c in vitro potency , \u201d meaning petri dish studies , \u201c often fails to translate to the clinic because of several factors , \u201d including the fact that the compounds aren \u2019 t bioavailable enough to build up to test-tube levels within the tumor in the body .\nSo , while \u201c some studies suggest an antiproliferative effect on cancer cells in vitro\u2026evidence from clinical trials is currently lacking \u201d \u2014that is , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , untreatable cancer were treated either with daily melatonin , which researchers thought might boost anticancer immunity , or melatonin with about 20 drops of an aloe extract , prepared by soaking one part aloe leaves to nine parts 40-proof alcohol .\nAnd , the aloe group appeared to do better .\nThey were nearly twice as likely to have either a partial response or at least some stabilization , and , the most important outcome , improved survival .\nYou can see the chart of the survival curves below and at 3:43 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , 80 percent of the aloe group were still alive , whereas more than half of the non-aloe group had died .\nThe researchers concluded that melatonin and aloe may be recommended to \u201c patients with very advanced untreatable \u201d cancers , since it didn \u2019 t seem to cause any bad side effects and , in fact , seemed to help .\nWe don \u2019 t know if the aloe helps on its own , though , and a subsequent study by the same research group muddied the waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tincture of myrrh .\nThe main problem with these studies , however , is that they weren \u2019 t randomized .\nIf sicker patients were intentionally\u2014or unintentionally\u2014placed in the non-aloe control group , that alone could explain the apparent aloe benefit .\nThe problem is there had never been any randomized studies of aloe for advanced cancers , until 2009 , which I cover in my video Can Aloe Cure Cancer ?\n.", "author": "Michael Greger M.D. FACLM", "url":

misinformation , \u201d none more elaborate than promoting aloe vera for the treatment of cancer .\nAs I discuss in my video Can Aloe Cure Cancer ?\n, there was a recent case report involving a 64-year-old Hispanic woman with a tumor on her eyeball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below and at 0:31 in my video , looked like a classic case of ocular surface squamous neoplasia ( OSSN ) , a type of eye cancer .\nSurgery was recommended to remove it , \u201c but the patient declined it , and instead initiated the use of concentrated A. vera eye drops 3 times daily based on a friend \u2019 s suggestion.\n\u201d She just used an off-the-shelf aloe vera gel product , and , to the doctor \u2019 s surprise , the \u201c lesion showed significant improvement from only 1 month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patient \u2019 s lesion was noted to have dramatically regressed.\n\u201d When the case report was written , \u201c 6 years since her initial presentation , \u201d it appeared the cancer was gone and

efforts of the ocular surgeon\u2026recurrence rates as high as 56 % have been reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is not clinically evident at the time of surgical excision.\n\u201d In other words , little bits of cancer may be missed on surgery .\nIn this case , though , a tumor disappeared without any surgery at all .\nAre we sure it was cancerous ?\nThe patient had refused a biopsy , so we don \u2019

treatment option for many cases of OSSN , \u201d but at least there \u2019 s an option for patients to try if they don \u2019 t want to go down that route .\nOf course , this was just a single case report without a control group .\nIt isn \u2019 t as though she had tumors in both eyes and tried the aloe on only one .\nThere was a controlled study that I present at 2:08 in my video that suggested aloe could prolong survival in those with advanced untreatable cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ randomized controlled study .\nA decade later , we got just that .\nHundreds of patients with metastatic cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy with or without aloe , and , as you can see below and at 2:28 in my video , the aloe group had three times the number of complete responses and significantly greater objective tumor responses , and two-thirds had some level of disease control compared to only half in the non-aloe group .\nBut , does that translate out into improved survival ?\nYes .\nFor example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aloe group were still alive , whereas most in the non-aloe group had died .\nAs a bonus , the \u201c chemotherapy was substantially better tolerated \u201d in the aloe group , with less fatigue , for example , and better maintenance of their immune system , as you can see below and at 2:59 in my video .\nSo , given the better disease control and the better survival , \u201c this study seems to suggest that Aloe may be successfully associated with chemotherapy [ as an add-on therapy ] to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumor regression rate and survival time.\n\u201d As I mentioned , this was a randomized controlled study , but it wasn \u2019 t a randomized placebo-controlled study .\nIt \u2019 s not as though the control group got a fake aloe drink , so some of the tumor response may have

swallowing aloe can trigger liver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diarrhea or vomiting .\nFor example , there was a case reported of aloe-induced low potassium in a patient with breast cancer , which rapidly resolved once she stopped the aloe , thought to be due to the laxative effect aloe can have .\nIf you want to talk to your doctor about giving it a try , note this was not aloe vera , but aloe arborescens , a

\u2014the inflammatory enzyme\u2014 \u201c should help minimize this side effect \u201d and offer the best of both worlds .\nAnd , that \u2019 s what ginger seems to do .\nAs you can see below and at

\u201c accelerate recovery of muscular strength\u2026 \u201d Is fresh ginger preferable to powdered ?\nMaybe not .\nAs you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video , there are all sorts of compounds in ginger with creative names as gingerols , gingerdiols , and gingerdiones , but the most potent anti-inflammatory component may be compound called shogaols .\nInterestingly , dried ginger contains more than fresh , which \u201c justifies the uses of dry ginger in traditional systems of medicine for the treatment of various illnesses due to oxidative stress and inflammation.\n\u201d In that case , why not just give the extracted shogaol component in a pill by itself ?\nAs you can see below and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the active ginger components individually reduce inflammation , some more than others , but the whole ginger is greater than the sum of its parts .\nHowever , you can boost shogaol content of whole ginger by drying it , as they are the major gingerol dehydration products .\nIndeed , they \u2019

standard medical practices , a desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 or the desire to seek curative treatment because of the frustration with deficiencies in traditional medical interventions , therapies based on dietary interventions appeal to parents of children with autism as more safe , natural , and holistic approaches to treating their children \u201d \u2014but it also could be simply because the drugs don \u2019 t work .\n\u201c Pharmacological interventions in ASD are mainly aimed to reduce commonly associated symptoms , including inattention , impulsivity , hyperactivity , compulsions , anxiety , sleep disturbances , irritability , self-injury , and aggression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep\u2014but they have no effect on \u201c the core symptoms of ASD , \u201d like the social withdrawal and

rather than the core deficits in social skills and repetitive behavior .\nBoth drugs also have significant side effects , including weight gain and sedation .\nIt \u2019 s no surprise , therefore , that parents seek complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected children.\n\u201d Okay , but do the alternatives work any better ?\nIn the alternative medicine literature , you \u2019 ll see a lot of this kind of attitude : Evidence schmevidence !\nAs long as the treatment isn \u2019 t harmful , why not give it a try ?\nOr , going even further to suggest trying a treatment even if the evidence is stacked against it , because\u2014who knows ?\n\u2014maybe your kids are the exception .\nI \u2019 m sympathetic to that thinking .\n\u201c Unfortunately , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take advantage of parents desperate to try anything that sounds like it might help their children with autism .\nWe [ researchers ] receive several emails a week from practitioners offering \u2018 the cure \u2019 for autism ( often for the \u2018 low , low price \u2019 of $ 299 ) .\nWe are often horrified at how these emails use guilt and guile to encourage families to try these untested treatments because \u2018 if you really loved your child , wouldn \u2019 t you want to leave no stone unturned ?\n\u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these supposed cures will say things like \u2018 I know it

manifested by improved eye contact , alertness , and expansion of expressive language.\n\u201d Understandably , this sparked a media \u201c frenzy , \u201d and parents scrambled to find the stuff , which \u201c led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interesting television program may not , of course , be the same as what makes good science.\n\u201d You \u2019 ve got to put it to the test .\nA randomized

human secretin would work better ?\nNo , apparently not .\nThere was a \u201c lack of benefit \u201d from human secretin , too .\nBut , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my video , the data initially appeared to show that secretin totally worked .\nOne shot of secretin , and autism behaviors dropped within days !\nThe same thing happened when the placebo was injected , though , which is why we do placebo-controlled studies .\n\u201c The widespread circulation of [ those ] anecdotal reports of the benefits of secretin in the treatment of autism may have raised expectations among parents and

\u201c health philosophy is built around the holistic biblical notion \u201d that the human body should be treated as a temple .\nWhat \u2019 s more , many CHIP participants are Adventists , too .\nIs that why the program works so well ?\nBecause they have faith ?\nYou don \u2019 t know until you put it to the test .\nResearchers looked at the influence of religious affiliation on responsiveness to CHIP , studying 7,000 participants .\nEven though Seventh-Day Adventists ( SDAs ) make up less than 1 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five CHIP-goers were Adventists .\nHow did they do , compared with the non-Adventists ( non-SDAs ) ?\n\u201c Substantial reductions in selected risk factors were achieved\u2026for both SDA and non-SDA , \u201d but some of the reductions were greater among the non-Adventists .\n\u201c This indicates that SDA do not have a monopoly on good health\u2026 \u201d Middle class , educated individuals also disproportionally make up CHIP classes .\nWould the program work as well in poverty-stricken populations ?\nResearchers tried to reduce chronic disease risk factors among individuals living in rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country .\n\u201c Conventional wisdom has been that each participant needs financial \u2018 skin in the game \u2019 to ensure their attentiveness and commitment \u201d to lifestyle change programs .\nSo , if offered for free to impoverished communities , the results might not be as good .\nIn this case , however , the \u201c overall clinical changes in this pilot study [ were ] similar to those found in other 4-week CHIP classes throughout the United States , \u201d suggesting CHIP may have benefits that \u201c cross socioeconomic lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source.\n\u201d So , why don \u2019 t employers offer it free to employees to save on health care costs ?\nCHIP is \u201c described\u2026as \u2018 achieving some of the most impressive clinical outcomes published in the literature , \u2019 \u201d including \u201c clinical benefits of the intervention , as well as its cost-effectiveness\u2026 \u201d Lee Memorial , a health care network in Florida , offered CHIP to some of its employees as a pilot program .\n( Sadly , health care workers can be as unhealthy as everyone else . )\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my video , they reported an average 17-pound weight loss , a 20-point drop in bad LDL cholesterol , and blood pressure normalization in most participants .\nLee Memorial initially invested about $ 38,000 to make the program happen , but then saved $ 70,000 in reduced health care costs in just that next year .\nHow ?\nBecause the employees became so much healthier .\nThey got a financial return on investment of 1.8 times what they put in .\nThere hadn \u2019 t been a return on investment ( ROI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Dexter Shurney stepped up to the plate and published a workplace study out of Vanderbilt .\n\u201c There was a high degree of skepticism at the planning stage of this study that active engagement could be realized in a sizable portion of the study group around a lifestyle program that had as its main tenets exercise and a plant-based diet.\n\u201d Vanderbilt is , after all , in Tennessee , smack dab in the middle of the Stroke Belt , known for its Memphis ribs .\n( You can see a graphic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention below and at 3:55 in my video . )\nNevertheless , the subjects got on board enough to improve their blood sugar control and cholesterol .\nThey also reported \u201c positive changes in self-reported physical health and well-being .\nHealth care costs were substantially reduced for study participants compared to the non-participant group.\n\u201d For example , nearly a quarter of the participants were able to eliminate one or more of their medications , so they got about a two-to-one return on investment within just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c educating a member population about the benefits of a plant-based , whole-foods diet is feasible and can reduce associated health care costs.\n\u201d The largest workplace CHIP study done to date involved six employee populations , including , ironically , a drug company .\nThe study included a mix of white-collar and blue-collar workers .\nAs you can see below and at 4:40 in my video , there were dramatic changes experienced by the worst off .\nThose starting with blood pressures up around 170 over 100 saw their numbers fall to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest LDL cholesterol dropped 60 points and had a 300-point drop in triglycerides , as well as a 46-point drop in fasting blood sugars .\nTheoretically , someone coming into the program with both high blood pressure and high cholesterol might \u201c experience a 64 % to 96 % reduction in overall risk of myocardial infarction , \u201d a heart attack , our number one killer .\nAs Dr. Jacobson concluded in his editorial in Nutrition Action , \u201c For the cost of a Humvee , any town could have a CHIP @

you could use placebo cabbage , like iceberg lettuce leaves .\nIn fact , since both breasts are affected , \u201c women could also be used as their own controls , using different treatments for

marijuana versus tobacco , compared to nonsmokers ?\nAs you can see below and at 2:31 in my video , both marijuana smokers and tobacco smokers have elevated rates of chronic cough and excess sputum production , as well as acute episodes of bronchitis and wheezing , compared with nonsmokers .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ these respiratory symptoms eventually go away .\nDoes the same happen with marijuana ?\nWhat are the effects of quitting cannabis on respiratory symptoms ?\nAs you can see below and at 2:56 in my video , about 30 to 40 percent of regular cannabis users suffer from cough , excess sputum , wheezing , and shortness of breath .\nA thousand young adults were followed for years .\nIn those who kept smoking , their respiratory symptoms got worse or remained the same , but those who quit tended to get better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what are the long-term lung consequences ?\nWhat about chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases ( COPD ) , like emphysema ?\nEven if smoking a single joint compromises lung function as much as up to five cigarettes , you \u2019 re still smoking 15 times less overall .\nSo , shouldn \u2019 t you end up with less long-term lung damage ?\nThat is , indeed , what \u2019 s been found .\nEven long-term pot smokers don \u2019 t appear to suffer lasting lung damage .\nWhen people were followed for 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint didn \u2019 t appear to have any discernable effect on long-term lung function , though there may be some \u201c accelerated decline in pulmonary function \u201d among those smoking joints every day for decades , so marijuana \u201c moderation \u201d is suggested .\nIn other words , \u201c [ a ] caution against regular heavy marijuana usage is prudent , \u201d but \u201c even regular heavy use of marijuana \u201d is nothing

since , in many ways , smoke is smoke , and using \u201c devices with water filters , like bongs and hookahs , \u201d doesn \u2019 t help in terms of the tar exposure .\nAs I discuss in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Cannabis Vaporizer , where there \u2019 s fire , there \u2019 s smoke , and where there \u2019 s smoke , there are inflammatory irritants .\nIn fact , the \u201c regular smoking of cannabis\u2026is associated with significant airway inflammation that is similar in frequency , type , and magnitude to that observed in the lungs of tobacco [ cigarette ] smokers , \u201d which can result in prolonged respiratory symptoms , such as chronic coughing , excess sputum production , wheezing , and shortness of breath , as well as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infections .\nAs I said , in many ways , smoke

range of symptoms has been reported to be triggered by exposure to RF-EMF , \u201d the radiofrequency electromagnetic fields that emanate from cell phones during use , including headaches , nausea , dizziness , and fatigue .\nThe news media has been promoting this as \u201c a new medical condition , called electrosensitivity , or electromagnetic hypersensitivity.\n\u201d These stories have been

below and at 0:50 in my video Is Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity Real ?\n, to see how common this was , researchers sat college students on two big electromagnetic coils and then went through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt under both strong and weak electromagnetic field conditions .\nYou can see the graph below and at 0:57 in my video .\nStudents did report neurological symptoms , including headaches , drowsiness , dizziness , fatigue , and irritability , as well as visceral symptoms , such as palpitations , muscle tension , and nausea , though more nausea was experienced under the \u201c weak \u201d EMF condition .\nThey also reported abdominal pain , shortness of breath , and a little heartburn , and said they could feel it in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c cold skin , \u201d \u201c sweating , \u201d and \u201c itching.\n\u201d And , their sensory organs registered blurred vision , ringing in their ears , dry mouth , and a little stuffiness , along with some other symptoms .\nIn all , \u201c 40 college students were asked to rate their symptoms during \u2018 sham \u2019 , \u2018 weak \u2019 and \u2018 strong \u2019 exposure .\nIn reality there was no exposure at all , i.e .\nall

\u201d suggesting that those who claim to be experiencing these symptoms may be just deluding themselves .\nBefore jumping to conclusions , though , you want to study people who actually suffer from the disorder .\nSo , researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were sensitive to cell phones .\nAs you can see at 2:18 in my video , the subjects reported a variety of symptoms upon exposure to cell phone radiation\u2014all sorts of pains , sensations , dizziness , breathing difficulties , and more .\nSo , researchers sat them down in a chair with various active cell phones strapped near their head , and , boy , could they feel it !\nAs you can see below and at 2:27 in my video , they experienced a variety of symptoms\u2014but , ironically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sham , like a dummy bean-bag phone next to their head !\n\u201c Contrary to definite expectations , \u201d none of the so-called electrosensitive \u201c could distinguish whether the cellular phones were turned on or off.\n\u201d Nearly all such studies have found there is no evidence that the symptoms are anything but psychological in nature .\nResearchers have noted that those who claim such hypersensitivity tend to exhibit more obsessive-compulsive , hostile , phobic , and paranoid traits .\nSo , they changed the name .\nWhat used to be called \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now called \u201c idiopathic environmental intolerance

their symptoms are triggered by exposure to electromagnetic fields , repeated experiments have been unable to replicate this phenomenon under controlled conditions.\n\u201d How many are we talking about ?\n\u201c To date , 46 studies involving 1175 volunteers with IEI-EMF have tested whether exposure to electromagnetic fields can trigger the symptoms reported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the test , when all the studies are put together , as you can see below and at 3:49 in my video , not only were no significant impacts found on any of the symptoms , there was no evidence that subjects were even able

though , and in science , if you can \u2019 t replicate something , it basically doesn \u2019 t exist .\nSo , why does this notion of hypersensitivity persist ?\nWell , there is now an entire industry profiting from various gizmos claiming to protect people against electromagnetic fields , and the media seems to love the hypersensitivity story .\nYet \u201c [ w ] hy don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media has tended to claim that \u201c research into this area has been neglected .\nBut the research has been done .\nIn fact , dozens of double blind studies have been performed , but they have been systematically ignored by almost every single journalist covering the issue.\n\u201d Indeed , we have blind provocation studies published in the peer-reviewed academic literature that are almost all negative .\nYou could argue that the evidence is nearly unanimous .\n\u201c So why doesn \u2019 t the media ever mention this data ?\nPerhaps they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps they never came across it , and

.\nThe science just suggests that whatever the symptoms are , the cell phones don \u2019 t appear to be causing them .\nAnd , if you want to go there , one could just as fairly argue that those who

serious food-poisoning outbreaks , followed by fish , then beef .\nBut aren \u2019 t people more likely to order their burgers rarer than their chicken sandwiches ?\nThe primary location where

\u201d both at home and in the grocery store .\nAs I discuss in my video How to Shop for , Handle , and Store Chicken , a \u201c shop-along observational study was conducted to determine actual shopping , transportation , and storage behavior of consumers who purchase raw poultry products.\n\u201d What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand sanitizer nor wipes were observed in 71 % of grocery store meat

packages , \u201c therefore , it also is important to educate shoppers on the importance of using hand sanitizer in the meat section after touching poultry packages.\n\u201d Plastic bags were available in most meat sections , \u201c but only 25 % of shoppers used the bag for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poultry [ directly ] in the main basket of the grocery cart 84 % of the time , \u201d where it could come in direct contact with fresh produce that might then be eaten raw in a salad , for example .\nAfter the shoppers put the poultry in the basket , where did their hands go ?\nWithout using any kind of sanitizer , most shoppers then grabbed the handle of the cart .\n\u201c Because shoppers are not practicing good hand hygiene when handling poultry in the grocery store meat section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items as a result of contact with their hands .\nContact with other products occurred frequently in the cart , which could result in cross-contamination .\nTouching the cart after directly handling the poultry packages could potentially mean that the cart is a risk factor for Salmonella or Campylobacter The bacteria potentially left on the cart could affect other shoppers , not just the participant being observed.\n\u201d So , some kale shopper following all the safety precautions can come along and still be exposed to poultry contamination via the grocery cart .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ poultry shoppers may also touch a personal item after touching a raw poultry package .\nA personal item could even include their children .\nIn fact , as you can see below and at 2:29 in my video , after touching poultry packages , 31 percent of shoppers touched a personal item , like their purse or their child .\nMost shoppers left the store with poultry separated in its own bag , \u201c however , most consumers then took it out of this protective layer \u201d when they got home .\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the counter before it went into the fridge , and most shoppers \u201c stored raw poultry in the original package without an additional container or overwrap , \u201d where it could potentially come into contact with other items .\nFewer than one in five \u201c consumers correctly stored raw poultry\u2026on the bottom shelf of their refrigerators in a sealed container or plastic bag.\n\u201d Why the bottom shelf ?\nBecause if the \u201c raw juices \u201d leak , they could contaminate other foods .\nThe next mistake most people make is washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nUp to 90 percent of people say they wash their chicken before cooking it , because that \u2019 s what they \u2019 re used to and \u201c because they want to \u2018 rinse the slime off of just-opened chicken\u2026.\n\u2019 \u201d The problem is that \u201c when poultry is washed or rinsed , \u2018 splashing \u2019 of contaminated water can travel \u201d throughout a roughly two-foot halo , splattering slime on either side and in front of the sink .\nAnd , even though a lot of folks read or heard you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poultry , they continued to do it anyway .\nFewer than about one in ten people thaw frozen poultry properly\u2014that is , \u201c put the raw poultry in a sealed container or plastic bag , submerge it in cold water , and change the water every 30 mins per the USDA \u2019 s recommendation.\n\u201d And if you \u2019 re wondering whether it \u2019 s better to put raw poultry on a wood or plastic cutting board , neither is safe , because both get rapidly contaminated .\n\u201c Failure to use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsafe practice , given that 70 % of chicken pieces that were judged by consumers as \u2018 done \u2019 had not reached safe internal cooking temperatures according to a summary of food safety literature.\n\u201d In focus groups , \u201c many participants thought food thermometers were unnecessary to determine whether meat and poultry was \u2018 cooked thoroughly \u201d because they had been \u2018 cooking for years without once getting food poisoning , \u2019 \u201d but had they ever come down with what they thought was a 24-hour flu ?\nThere \u2019 s no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was likely food poisoning .\nActually , any stomach bug or stomach flu is most

a decade ago called Is Coffee Bad for You ?\n, I explained that the \u201c cholesterol-raising factor from\u2026coffee does not pass [ through ] a paper filter.\n\u201d As I discuss in my recent video Does Coffee Affect Cholesterol ?\n, if you give people French press coffee , which is filtered but without paper , their cholesterol starts swelling up within just two weeks , as you can see below and at 0:22 in the video .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee , their cholesterol comes right back down .\nIt \u2019 s the same amount of coffee , just prepared differently .\nThe cholesterol-raising factor from coffee beans has since been identified as the fatty substances in the oil within coffee beans .\nOne reason it took us so long to figure that out is that they didn \u2019 t raise cholesterol in rats , hamsters , or even in monkeys , but did in human beings , as you can see below and at 0:45 in my video .\nBut , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper filter .\n\u201c This explains why filtered coffee does not affect cholesterol , whereas Scandinavian \u2018 boiled , \u2019 cafetiere [ French press coffee ] , and Turkish coffees do.\n\u201d As you can see below and at 1:07 in my video , espresso , which has 20 times more cafestol , the cholesterol-raising substance , than paper-filtered drip coffee , also raises cholesterol , though French press , Turkish , and boiled coffees are progressively worse .\nInstant and percolated coffee are pretty low , even though neither is prepared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low as paper-filtered drip coffee .\nNote , however , that if you make drip coffee with a metal mesh filter common in many machines and do not add a paper filter in the cradle , it would presumably be just as bad as French press coffee .\nThe studies in general \u201c appeared to consistently find \u201d that this fatty component was filtered out by paper , but \u201c a small number of studies suggested that filtered coffee may also increase cholesterol levels , and began to cast some doubt into what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d So , yes , \u201c although the cholesterol-raising effects brought about by the consumption of filtered coffee may not be as strong as those of the boiled coffee , it is important not to discard the possibility that filtered coffee may also play a small but important role in explaining the cholesterol-raising effects of coffee.\n\u201d I had known about a study that found that three cups a day of filtered coffee raised total cholesterol , but the increase in \u201c bad \u201d LDL cholesterol was not statistically significant , as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my video .\nResearchers got the same results in another study , finding that subjects who stopped consumption of filtered coffee reduced their total cholesterol , which suggests that perhaps paper coffee filters only achieve partial cafestol removal .\nHad anyone ever just measured the levels of the cholesterol-raising compounds found in the paper filters ?\nIndeed , researchers investigated just that and found most of the cholesterol-raising cafestol was retained by the coffee grounds , rather than actually getting stuck in the paper filter itself .\nIn other words , \u201c the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not necessarily blocking the compound itself , but blocking any fine particles that are carrying the compound .\nThis is similar to when you make French press coffee .\nWhen you depress that plunger with its fine mesh screen , you \u2019 ll still get a little sludge at the bottom of the cup .\nThat sludge is made up of the tiny particles that pass through the screen and can carry some of the risk .\nSo , a little cafestol does get through the filter .\nAs you can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can cut out more than 90 percent of cafestol by switching from a French press or coffee maker with a metal mesh filter to one with a paper filter .\nIf you use coffee that starts out with a high level of the cafestol compound , you \u2019 re still clearing out about 95 percent with the paper filter , but could there still be enough left to bump up your LDL ?\nYou don \u2019 t know until you\u2026put it to the test .\nAs you can see below and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects started out drinking a high-cafestol coffee , and after a month of drinking two cups a day , their LDL cholesterol increased significantly , even though the coffee was paper-filtered .\nSo , if you have high cholesterol despite eating a healthy diet , you may want to try cutting out coffee and then getting retested .\nOr , you can try switching to a lower cafestol coffee .\nThere are all sorts of variables that may affect cafestol levels , including roasting degree or grind size , and one can imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater extraction .\nSince roasting appears to destroy some cafestol , a really dark roast should have less , but no significant difference was seen between the rise in cholesterol after a medium light roast versus a medium roast ; both raised bad cholesterol .\nIn the chapters on liver disease , depression , and Parkinson \u2019 s in my book How Not to Die , I discussed the benefits of coffee for the liver , mind , and brain .\nCoffee drinkers do seem to live longer and have lower cancer rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflux disease , bone loss , glaucoma , and urinary incontinence .\nThe bottom line is that I don \u2019 t recommend drinking coffee , but mainly because every cup of coffee is a lost opportunity to drink something even more healthful , such as a cup of green tea , which wouldn \u2019 t have the adverse cholesterol consequences .", "author": "Michael Greger M.D. FACLM", "url":

"Jet Lag Treatment Cheat Sheet", "content": "Use cheat sheets to figure out exactly when and how to treat jet lag using light exposure and light avoidance at specific times of the day , based on which direction you \u2019 re going and how many time zones you cross .\n\u201c Jet lag is a blessing to circadian biologists because the disruption of mental and physical well-being immediately highlights the importance of our internal \u2018 body clock , \u2019 \u201d the focus of their work .\nMuch of the general malaise we may experience on long journeys may just be \u201c so-called \u2018 travel fatigue , \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mode of transport and the number of time zones crossed , \u201d leaving people feeling disorientated , generally weary , and headachy .\nDehydration has been blamed .\nThe air circulated in the cabins of commercial airlines is pretty dry , but even though it can make your throat , skin , and eyes feel dry , the maximum loss of fluid through breath and sweat , for instance , wouldn \u2019 t be more than about an extra half cup if you actually did the math .\nSo , it isn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Death Valley or the Sahara when on a flight .\n\u201c Further , the calculation assumes that the passenger would be nude , \u201d and I \u2019 m sure the airline would charge you extra for that !\nOf course , \u201c airplane food\u2014if any is served\u2014tends to be starchy and sugary , \u201d and giving passengers salty snacks like pretzels during a flight doesn \u2019 t help .\n\u201c The vegetarian\u2026special meals are sometimes an improvement , but you must order them in advance .\nBYOF\u2014bring your own fruit\u2014is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag of unsalted almonds or walnuts is a healthy alternative to those skimpy bags of salted peanuts.\n\u201d The cabin air isn \u2019 t just dry , though ; it \u2019 s also low in oxygen pressure , about what you \u2019 d get at 10,000 feet above sea level , which is about twice as high as Denver .\nThat alone can make you feel lousy .\nThen , when you land , if you \u2019 ve crossed enough time zones , you can suffer from jet lag .\nJet lag is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your destination and that of your own internal body clock , which is still on home time .\n\u201c This desynchrony is abnormal , \u201d since our internal clock is normally synced to the outside world .\nSymptoms of jet lag do go away , though , as your body becomes hip to the new time .\nThe \u201c duration of jet lag in days can be calculated to be two-thirds the number of time zones crossed eastwards , compared with half the number of zones crossed westwards.\n\u201d Let \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see below and at 2:04 in my in my video How to Treat Jet Lag with Light , London is six time zones eastward from Chicago .\nSo , after flying there , it may take four days before you get back to normal\u2014six eastward time zones multiplied by two-thirds .\nOn the other hand , Londoners flying westward to Chicago should get over their jet lag in only three days\u2014six westward time zones divided by two .\nThe reason it \u2019 s easier to go westward , where the day is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastward , is because our internal clock is naturally set for longer than 24 hours\u2014 \u201c closer to 25 h , \u201d in fact\u2014and has to be reset every day .\n\u201c It is for this reason that the observed rhythms are called circadian ( from the Latin : about a day.\n\u201d Interestingly , you can see this in Major League Baseball performance .\nResearchers churned through 40,000 games , mining 20 seasons , and found \u201c surprisingly specific effects of circadian misalignment [ jet lag ] on athletic performance under natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects were largely evidence after eastward travel with very limited effects after westward travel , consistent with the > 24-h period length of the human circadian clock.\n\u201d Okay , so how do you treat it ?\nAs you can see below and at 3:05 in my video , you first need to decide whether it needs to be treated at all .\nIf you \u2019 re just traveling over one or two time zones , you don \u2019 t have to worry about it .\nIf you \u2019 re crossing three or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast to coast , jet lag \u201c will be experienced , \u201d so it then depends on how long you plan on staying .\nIf only for a few days , it \u2019 s probably not worth treating , because you \u2019 ll then have to switch back as soon as you return home .\n\u201c In these cases , \u201d if you have control over your schedule , though , it \u2019 s better to \u201c time appointments in the new time zone to coincide with daytime in the home zone that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times that coincide with night on \u2018 body time.\n\u2019 \u201d So , it \u2019 s pretty much common sense : If you travel east , your body will still think it should be sleeping in the morning , so you should push your activities to later in the day , and vice versa .\nBut , if you are going to be gone for a while , for a week or more , for example , you can adjust your body clock using behavioral methods and/or drugs , supplements , or foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire way to avoid jet lag altogether and that is to adapt to the new time zone before flight , \u201d meaning before you leave on your trip .\nChanging your home sleep schedule more than two hours , however , can be \u201c counter-productive , \u201d because it will interfere with your pre-trip sleep and you don \u2019 t want to go into a long trip already sleep-deprived .\nIn fact , before your trip , you want to maximize your sleep .\nIn flight , as you can see below and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendation is for \u201c immediate adjustment to destination meal and light schedule , \u201d although this is easier said than done .\nThen , once you land , you want to \u201c attempt to maintain destination sleep schedule.\n\u201d Try not to nap for more than 15 to 30 minutes , and don \u2019 t drive around when your body thinks it \u2019 s the middle of the night .\nThe real key to treating jet lag , however , is light therapy .\nTraveling eastward , you expose yourself to the bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light in the evening .\nThe opposite is the case when traveling westward\u2014 \u201c evening exposure to bright light ; morning avoidance of bright light\u2026 \u201d Seems simple , right ?\nIt \u2019 s actually a bit more complicated than that .\n\u201c The advice changes\u2026if you \u2019 ve traveling through more than six time zones\u2014say from Boston to Athens .\nYour biological clock may adjust in the wrong direction , reacting to light in the morning as if it were afternoon.\n\u201d Okay , but what if I tell you it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The effects of light acting upon the body clock \u201d are actually only during a specific window around the time your body temperature bottoms out , which is usually around 4 AM .\nAs part of our circadian rhythm , our body temperature typically drops from 98.6 degrees down to more like 97.6 degrees , even when we aren \u2019 t sleeping , as you can see below and at 5:02 in my video .\nWhat \u2019 s the bottom line ?\nI feature two cheat sheets at 5:12 in my video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snap a picture or screengrab them for future reference .\nIf you fly eastward across eight time zones from Los Angeles to London , for example , on day one , you should avoid light between 6 AM and noon local time and then expose yourself to light between noon and 6 PM .\nlocal time .\nThe rest of that first day , your light exposure won \u2019 t matter and won \u2019 t affect you either way .\n\u201c On subsequent days , the local times of light avoidance and exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 2 h each day until light avoidance coincides with nocturnal sleep , \u201d that is , when you \u2019 re sleeping at night .\nBut , on those first few days after traveling eastward , note that you \u2019 ll want to avoid morning light , which \u201c can be difficult to achieve , particularly on the day of arrival , since many flights are overnight and land in the morning\u2026 \u201d One thing you can do is wear really dark glasses until you get indoors .\nOf course , if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t really drive , which is when those not-so-attractive orange lenses that block blue wavelengths can come in handy , as they prevent the dip in melatonin you can get with regular sunglasses , as you can see below and at 6:09 in my video .\nRegardless , the next day , you might have the urge to get \u201c out and about , \u201d but that could actually make your jet lag worse by taking you in the opposite direction .\nWhat about if you \u2019 re flying eastward more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you subtract the number from 24 and treat it as travel westward .\nFor instance , an eastward trip across ten time zones\u2014New York to Delhi , say\u2014should be treated as a westward flight , requiring a delay of the body clock across 14 time zones .\nIn that case , it would be easy to get outside and get some sun , but what would you do if you just went four zones westward and needed to get light in the middle of the night ?\nOne gadget company came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see below and at 6:57 in my video .\nThe theory is that you could bathe your brain in light directly through the ear canals .\nResearchers stuck them on the heads of cadavers and did seem to get some light penetration , but you don \u2019 t know\u2026until you put it to the test .\nA randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that \u201c transcranial bright light exposure via the ear canals alleviates jet lag symptoms.\n\u201d Or\u2026you could just turn on a lamp .", "author": "Michael Greger M.D. FACLM", "url": "https://nutritionfacts.org/2022/09/27/jet-lag-treatment-cheat-sheet/",

supplements tend not to contain what they say they do , and the contaminants could be dangerous .\nIf you \u2019 re crossing three or more time zones during a journey and plan to stay at your destination for a week or more , long enough to make it worthwhile , you can adjust your body clock to the new time by \u201c using behavioural and , if desired , pharmacological methods.\n\u201d The behavioral method is light exposure and light avoidance at specific times of the day based on which direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time zones you cross .\nI feature a helpful table with \u201c recommendations for the use of bright light to adjust body clock after time zone transitions \u201d at 0:23 in my video Are Melatonin Supplements Safe ?\n, which you can also see below .\nYou may want to take a picture or screengrab it for future reference .\nThe pharmacological intervention is melatonin .\n\u201c It is called the \u2018 darkness hormone \u2019 sometimes because\u2026it is secreted at the onset of darkness and is suppressed by light.\n\u201d A little gland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secrete it as soon as it gets dark and shuts off when the sun comes up in the morning , thereby helping to set your circadian rhythm .\nA lot of research has been conducted on treating jet lag , but most of it has been on rats instead of people , as you can see below and at 0:53 in my video .\nBut , of the handful of human trials that have been done , most have found that taking melatonin \u201c close to the target bedtime at the destination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the new time can effectively decrease jet-lag symptoms after long flights \u201c crossing five or more time zones.\n\u201d It \u2019 s important to note that \u201c melatonin differs from most or all other drugs in that the timing of the dose is critical and determines the effect ; given at the wrong time it will delay circadian adaptation to local time , \u201d making jet lag even worse .\nFor example , if you were to take \u201c melatonin at bedtime when traveling west , \u201d it \u201c actually could result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c phase delay is desired.\n\u201d Taking a daily dose of melatonin between 0.5 and 5 mg of melatonin seems to be \u201c similarly effective \u201d in terms of helping with jet-lag symptoms , but the higher dose does have more of a sleeping pill-type effect , allowing people to \u201c fall asleep faster and sleep better after 5mg than 0.5mg , \u201d but that appears to plateau at about 5 mg. Those are massive doses , though .\nEven taking only a 3 mg dose produces levels in the bloodstream 50 times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works , but we don \u2019 t know how safe that is .\nAfter all , in the early days , melatonin \u201c was known as an anti-gonadal hormone , \u201d with human-equivalent doses of just 1 or 2 mgs reducing the size of sex organs and impairing fertility in laboratory animals .\nNow , obviously , rats aren \u2019 t people , but \u201c considering the pronounced effects of\u2026melatonin on reproductive physiology in these nonhuman mammals , to assume they would not have

post-marketing surveillance like there is with prescription drugs .\n\u201c Without a license , there is no obligation for undesirable side effects following melatonin use to be recorded.\n\u201d And , let \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supplements are so poorly regulated that that you never really know what \u2019 s actually in them .\nIndeed , the \u201c purity of melatonin\u2026 can not be guaranteed .\nFor these reasons , melatonin can not be recommended\u2026.\n\u201d Is the purity issue just theoretical though ?\nYou don \u2019 t know until you put it to the test .\nIndeed , due to the \u201c poor quality control of over-the-counter melatonin , \u201d what the labels \u201c say is often not what you get.\n\u201d Melatonin is not only one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but among children , too .\nAn analysis of 31 different brands found that most had just a fraction of what was claimed .\nWhat makes that even more egregious is that actual melatonin content varied up to nearly 500 percent compared

contain 1.5 mg , \u201d which could result in a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In short , there was no guarantee of the strength or purity of OTC melatonin , \u201d leading these researchers to suggest it should be regulated as a drug so that , by law , it would at least contain what it says on the bottle .\nOkay , but that \u2019 s regarding its strength .\nWhat about its purity ?\n\u201c Four of six melatonin products from health food stores \u201d \u2014two-thirds\u2014 \u201c contained impurities \u201d that could not be characterized .\nBut , with no exclusive patent , \u201c no @ @ @ @ @ @ @

\u201c How much do you think you could eat ?\n\u201d described lower prospective food intake .\nSince the control was just plain hot water , the participants knew when they were getting the ginger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect .\nThe researchers considered putting the ginger into capsules to do a double-blinded study , but they thought part of the ginger \u2019 s effect may actually be through taste receptors on the tongue , so they didn \u2019 t want to interfere with that with a capsule .\nNot all of the effects were just subjective , though .\nFour hours after drinking the hot beverage , the metabolic rate in the ginger group was elevated compared to control , as you can see in the graph below and at 2:12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a previous study , when fresh ginger was added to a meal , there was

if 1,200 mg of Chlorella will help .\n( That \u2019 s just about a daily half-teaspoon , costing about nickel a day . )\nAs you can see below and at 2:21 in my video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liver inflammation , perhaps because the subjects lost significantly more weight\u2014about a pound a week over the eight weeks\u2014and that would explain the significant improvement in fasting blood sugars that was also found .\nThe researchers conclude that Chlorella has \u201c significant weight-reducing effects \u201d with \u201c meaningful improvements \u201d in liver function .\nHow about a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled study of Chlorella for cholesterol ?\n\u201c Compared with the control group , the Chlorella group exhibited remarkable changes in total cholesterol\u2026 \u201d How remarkable were the changes ?\nOnly 1.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And note that the study evaluated total cholesterol .\nIf you look at what really matters\u2014the so-called bad LDL cholesterol\u2014there was no effect whatsoever , as you can see below and at 3:01 in my video .\nThankfully , that \u2019 s not what other studies found .\nA meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials of Chlorella for cholesterol , involving hundreds of subjects , found that those taking Chlorella did drop their LDL cholesterol by eight points on average and even dropped their blood pressure a few points .\nFour grams or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks seems to be the magic formula , which would be about two daily teaspoons .\nThat \u2019 s a lot of Chlorella , but if you can find a palatable way to take it , it might help .\nIn a more recent study , a double-blind , randomized , and placebo-controlled dietary cholesterol challenge , researchers had 34 study subjects eat three eggs a day ( a total of 510 mg of dietary cholesterol ) with either a few spoonful of Chlorella or a matched placebo for four weeks .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my video , the participants had a 14 percent rise in LDL cholesterol from just eating the eggs alone , but with the Chlorella , it was significantly less .\nTherefore , Chlorella can play \u201c a useful role in maintaining healthy serum [ blood ] cholesterol levels , \u201d though another way would be not to eat three eggs a day .\nThat reminds me of another study that was performed \u201c to assess the ability of Chlorella vulgaris to detoxify carcinogenic HCAs , \u201d which are heterocyclic amines , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bake , broil , or barbecue meat .\nThe Chlorella did seem to lower the levels of one of the cooked meat carcinogens flowing through the subjects \u2019 bodies but didn \u2019 t quite reach statistical significance , as you can see below and at 4:27 in my video .\nWhat about polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) , another class of cancer-causing compounds found particularly in smoked meats and cigarettes that \u201c includes numerous genotoxic [ DNA-damaging ] carcinogens \u201d ?\nAgain , Chlorella did seem to lower levels but not significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re going to have eggs and ham for breakfast , might as well try to add lots of Chlorella to make them green eggs and ham .", "author": "Michael Greger M.D. FACLM",

You can see a photo at 0:14 in my video . )\nYou may recall that I \u2019 ve talked about lavender before , but what about tea tree oil ?\nIt all started with a case series published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The researchers described three young boys in whom breast growth \u201c coincided with the topical application of products that contained lavender and tea tree oils.\n\u201d How do we know the products were to blame ?\n\u201c Gynecomastia resolved in each patient shortly after the use of products containing these oils was discontinued .\nFurthermore , studies in human cell lines indicated that the two oils had estrogenic and antiandrogenic activities , \u201d that is , pro-female and anti-male hormone activities .\nThe researchers concluded that \u201c repeated topical exposure to lavender and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these boys.\n\u201d A tea tree oil company representative pointed out that \u201c only one of three boys ( Patient 2 ) was exposed to any amount of tea tree oil , \u201d while all three subjects were exposed to lavender oil .\nSo , lavender oil may have been to blame in all three cases .\nHow did the researchers respond ?\n\u201c There may be a valid argument that it was the lavender oil that caused the gynecomastia .\nHowever , the tea tree oil had activity similar to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vitro estrogenic and antiandrogenic effects.\n\u201d Let me walk you through that .\nAs you can see below in the graph and at 1:24 in my video , if you drip a tiny amount of estrogen on human breast cancer cells in a petri dish , you can spike their growth more than twelve-fold .\nIf you add an estrogen blocker along with the estrogen , though , it abolishes the effect .\nBut , adding increasing amounts of tea tree oil to the breast cancer cells causes their growth to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s an estrogenic effect is because the growth decreases when you add the estrogen blocker .\nThis appears to be pretty convincing , but herbal proponents argue that \u201c in vitro testing alone is not adequate grounds for indicting traditionally used products and may raise public fear.\n\u201d The Tea Tree Oil Industry Association specifically argued \u201c that only 3 of more than 100 compounds \u201d of pure tea tree actually make it through the skin , so the researchers should have just measured the hormonal effects of those three compounds\u2014which they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see in the graph and at 2:25 in my video , dripping increasing concentrations of whole tea tree oil on breast cancer cells in a petri dish can increase their growth when compared to an oil with no estrogenic effect , like eucalyptus oil .\nHowever , if you only look at the three components of tea tree oil that actually make it into your bloodstream when you apply them on your skin , none appears to have any estrogenic effects .\nNone of the components that penetrate the skin appears to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor in combination , \u201d so you can \u2019 t extrapolate the petri dish effects of the whole oil to what one might see when it \u2019 s applied on the skin .\nWhat you see in the petri dish may not be identical to what you see in a person .\nThis new data led European consumer safety officials to conclude that \u201c the hypothesized correction\u2026of gynecomastia to the topical use of Tea Tree Oil is considered implausible.\n\u201d In fact , if the anti-male hormone components of tea tree oil remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to treat women who feel they are affected by hirsutism , or excessive hairiness ?\nA study was conducted on such women who were

the lining of our mouths .\nSimilar to other chronic inflammatory conditions , DNA damage due to oxidative stress caused by free radicals is thought to play a role .\nNormally , free radical production is balanced with antioxidants , but if the concentration of free radicals gets too high and our antioxidant enzymes and the antioxidants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not compensate for these radicals , the balance changes in favor of the oxidants \u201d \u2014that is , in a pro-oxidant direction .\nThis can lead to oxidative damage within our body .\nDoes that mean that people who experience recurring canker sores\u2014also known as recurrent aphthous stomatitis ( RAS ) \u2014have fewer antioxidants , more oxidation , and more DNA damage ?\nYes , yes , and yes .\nAs you can see in the graph below and at 0:51 in my video Best Supplement for Canker Sores , they exhibit more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloodstream , lower antioxidant status , and more DNA damage .\nThis suggests it might be possible for antioxidants to help improve the DNA damage caused by recurring canker sores , but you don \u2019 t know until you put it to the test .\nSixteen boys and girls around age 12 with recurring canker sores were given a whopping 2,000 mg ( 2 g ) of vitamin C a day .\nThat \u2019 s considered the tolerable upper daily limit for adults before you start getting diarrhea , and 1,200 mg may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it \u2019 s all about risks versus benefits .\nHow did they do ?\nAs you can see in the graph below and at 1:33 in my video , 15 out of the 16 kids cut the number of canker sores they were getting at least in half .\nIn the three months before they started the vitamin C , they had averaged four canker sores each , but in the three months they were on it , they each had less than one on average .\nWhen they stopped the vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ulcers started coming back .\nThen , when they once again added the vitamin C , the canker sore rate dropped again .\nWhat about directly applying antioxidants , like a turmeric gel ?\nLet \u2019 s find out .\nA turmeric gel containing 2 percent curcumin , the yellow pigment in the spice turmeric , was swabbed directly onto canker sores twice a day and \u201c significantly reduced pain intensity and size of the aphthous ulcer [ canker sore ] compared to placebo , \u201d which was a gel containing no active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t it be nice to see a comparison to an active treatment from an independent research group , rather than this study without an active treatment that was funded by the curcumin gel manufacturer ?\nYes , and here we go .\nThis randomized clinical trial compared a generic 2 percent curcumin gel to a prescription steroid gel and found that the curcumin worked just as well .\nThis provides \u201c strong evidence that [ topical ] curcumin gel can be used as an effective and safer alternative to steroids in treatment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve previously discussed that topical honey beat out the same steroid for both ulcer healing and pain reduction , as you can see in the graph and at 2:46 in my video .\nSo , if you \u2019 re going to use something topically , honey seems better , but what if , instead of a topical application , you just want to swallow something like vitamin C but want something that doesn \u2019 t give you diarrhea ?\nThirty-one patients with recurring canker sores were split into two groups and received either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeast beta-glucan fiber , which is the amount found in just an eighth of a teaspoon of brewer \u2019 s yeast or nutritional yeast .\nAs you can see below and at 3:17 in my video , the placebo group experienced no significant change , whereas ulcer severity in the yeast group was cut nearly in half .\nSo , now you have another useful alternative .\nIf it \u2019 s all about antioxidants , can \u2019 t you just treat recurring canker sores by eating a plant-based diet high in fruits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put to the test , but keep in mind a plant-based diet could also make things worse if one is not ensuring a regular reliable source of vitamin B12 through supplements or fortified foods .\nFor example , a 30-year-old women had recurring canker sores for four years .\nShe ate few animal products and didn \u2019 t supplement with vitamin B12 , so she became B12-deficient and began experiencing weakness , tiredness , numbness , and tingling .\nShe was immediately started on vitamin B12 , and her deficiency symptoms got better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she experienced \u201c a rapid and complete recovery \u201d within weeks of starting vitamin B12 after years of suffering .\nWe \u2019 ve known since the 1970s that vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to canker sores\u2014so much so that it \u2019 s recommended to consider B12 deficiency any time a patient has with recurring canker sores .\nIn fact , a number of nutrient deficiencies may contribute .\nA study compared the lab tests of those with recurrent canker sores to those without and found that more than half of the canker sore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blood-forming nutrient deficiencies .\nIn contrast , less than one in ten in the non-canker sore group exhibited these deficiencies .\nIn this case , we \u2019 re talking about iron and folate deficiency in addition to vitamin B12 deficiency .\nWhen the study participants were given supplements , their canker sores improved and this was more pronounced among those who had no family history of canker sore problems .\nYou can see how vitamin and mineral supplements might help people who are deficient , but might a supplement like vitamin B12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficient ?\nApparently so .\nAs the title of the study states , \u201c cyanocobalamin \u201d \u2014the most common form of supplemental B12\u2014 \u201c may be beneficial in the treatment of recurrent aphthous ulcers [ canker sores ] even when vitamin B12 levels are normal.\n\u201d The researchers took a group of 72 patients with frequent canker sores and gave them vitamin B12 , regardless of what their levels were .\nNinety-six percent of the participants got better regardless of whether they started out vitamin B12\u2013deficient or with normal vitamin B12 levels in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below and at 5:37 in my video .\nIn this case , there was no control group , though , so we don \u2019 t know how many would have gotten better without the vitamin B12 supplement .\nIn addition , the researchers injected the vitamin B12 , and injections can have an even greater placebo effect than pills\u2014especially with something like a syringe of vitamin B12 , which has a striking mad-scientist-looking ruby red color , as you can see below and at 5:57 in my video .\nIf only there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oral vitamin B12 for canker sores .\nAnd , here we go .\nIn this case , 1,000 micrograms of sublingual vitamin B12 were taken every day for six months .\nIt took five months , but , eventually , the duration of canker outbreaks , the number of ulcers , and the level of pain were significantly reduced , \u201c regardless of initial vitamin B12 levels in the blood.\n\u201d So , whether you are vitamin B12\u2013deficient or not , B12 supplements seem to help .\nBy the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamin B12 group appeared to have been cured .\nThe researchers concluded that \u201c vitamin B12 treatment , which is simple , inexpensive , and low-risk ,

available balance of evidence say right now about what to eat and what to avoid to reduce your risk of cancer ?\nIn 1982 , a landmark report on diet , nutrition , and cancer was released by the National Academy of Sciences .\nIt was \u201c the first major , institutional , science-based report on this topic.\n\u201d The report started out saying that \u201c scientists must be especially careful in their choice of words whenever they are not totally confident about their conclusions.\n\u201d For example , by that time , it had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing people .\n\u201c If the population been persuaded to stop smoking when the association with lung cancer was first reported , these cancer deaths would not be occurring.\n\u201d If you wait for absolute certainty , millions of people could die in the meantime , which is why , sometimes , you have to invoke the precautionary principle .\nFor example , \u201c emphasizing fruits and vegetables to reduce the risk of several common forms of cancer.\n\u201d We \u2019 re not completely sure , but there \u2019 s good evidence\u2014and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no disadvantages for healthy people eating more fruits and vegetables , \u201d as I discuss in my video The Best Advice on Diet and Cancer .\nThe 1982 National Academy of Sciences report continued : \u201c The public is now asking about the causes of cancers that are not associated with smoking .\nWhat are these causes , and how can these cancers be avoided ?\nUnfortunately , it is not yet possible to make firm scientific pronouncements about the association between diet and cancer .\nWe are in an interim stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 years ago .\nTherefore , in the judgment of the committee , it is now the time to offer some interim guidelines on diet and cancer.\n\u201d The committee raised concern about processed meats , for example , and , 30 years later , that concern was confirmed .\nProcessed meat was officially declared \u201c carcinogenic to humans.\n\u201d Maybe if we had listened back in the early 1980s when the red flag first started waving , then we would have been spared Lunchables , about which a CEO of Philip Morris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , \u2018 If you take Lunchables apart , the most healthy item in it is the napkin.\n\u2019 \u201d The findings of this landmark 1982 diet and cancer report \u201c generated a striking level of disbelief from the cancer community and outright hostility from people whose livelihood depended on foods in question and the food industry whose products were being questioned.\n\u201d In fact , one of the authors of the report was \u201c accused of \u2018 killing more people than those being saved , \u2019 \u201d and there were formally organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional societies .\nIndeed , \u201c clearly a very sensitive nerve was touched.\n\u201d The American Meat Science Association and other members of the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology criticized the report and released \u201c Diet , Nutrition , and Cancer : A Critique \u201d in 1982 .\nThey agreed that perhaps lives would be saved , but argued that the recommended \u201c reductions in meat consumption would sharply reduce incomes to the livestock and meat processing industries\u2026.The fruit and vegetable industries would clearly benefit from the expanded demand for their products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHowever , fruits and vegetables account for less than 15 percent of cash receipts for U.S. agriculture.\n\u201d Most of the money is in \u201c cattle , hogs , poultry products , feed grains , and oil crops.\n\u201d This reminds me of the tobacco industry memo where Philip Morris spoke of the tobacco industry going bankrupt .\nMaybe it \u2019 s not the meat that \u2019 s causing cancer , the industry critique continued , but all the marijuana people are smoking these days .\n\u201c How then can one argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nOr is this only some jealous attack on the goodness of our diet , like that of the Reverend Jonathan Edwards in Puritan times who condemned bear baiting , not because of the pain for the bear but because of the pleasure of the spectators.\n\u201d You can \u2019 t tell us to cut down on meat , they argued , \u201c one of mankind \u2019 s few remaining pleasures is that of the table.\n\u201d The day the National Academy of

against certain cancers .\nHow can one select foods that contain unidentified compounds ?\n\u2026This is not a scientific recommendation ; it sounds like \u2018 health food store \u2019

talked about eating more fruits and vegetables .\nWhat are the other five recommendations that invoke the precautionary principle ?\nConsumption of soy products may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer , but also increase chances of surviving it .\nIn terms of dietary guidance suggestions on foods to cut down on , where evidence is sufficiently compelling , recommendations included \u201c limiting or avoiding dairy products to reduce the risk of prostate cancer ; limiting or avoiding alcohol to reduce the risk of cancers of the mouth , pharynx [ throat ] , larynx , esophagus , colon , rectum , and breast ; avoiding red and processed meat to reduce the risk of cancers of the colon and rectum ; [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and broiled meats to reduce the risk of cancers of the colon , rectum , breast , prostate ,

video Friday Favorites : Urinary Tract Infections from Eating Chicken , \u201c multiple lines of evidence indicate poultry as a major food animal reservoir for urinary tract infections \u201d \u2014that is , a source for the bacteria that cause UTIs in people .\n( You may recall I explored this several years ago , as discussed in my video Avoiding Chicken to Avoid Bladder Infections . )\nThis is based not only on studies showing that blood infections , brain infections , and urinary tract infections in mouse models can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coli from commercial chicken meat and eggs , but also on studies of women with multidrug-resistant urinary tract infections reporting significantly more frequent consumption of retail chicken .\nSimilarly , elderly consumers of chicken were significantly more likely to have Cipro-resistant bladder infections compared to those eating no chicken at all .\nPork , but not beef , was also associated with increased risk , as you can see below and at 1:14 in my video .\n\u201c There have been few observed associations between beef cattle or retail beef and human ExPEC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reservoir for human ExPEC \u201d ( bladder infections ) , whereas , in chickens , of the up to 90 percent of chicken carcasses harboring E. coli , about one in five isolates tested had the potential to cause urinary tract infections .\nWhat about eggs ?\nWe know retail chicken meat \u201c is contaminated with ExPEC isolates that resemble the strains that cause human infections , \u201d but what about retail chicken eggs ?\nInstead of one in five being ExPEC in chicken meat , it was more like just 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to levels for pork or beef .\nResearchers are so sure that chicken is the primary reservoir that when they find the same kind of strain in a vegetarian , they interpret that \u201c as consistent with human-to-human transmission or errors in reporting of poultry consumption rather than human strains being derived from a source other than chicken.\n\u201d Someone may claim to be vegetarian but actually eat some chicken , for instance , or perhaps there was human-to-human or even shopping-cart-to-human transmission .\n( See my How to Shop for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Most people fail to sanitize their hands after picking up a package of poultry in the grocery store , so the \u201c bacteria potentially left on the cart could affect other shoppers\u2026.A shopper who is not purchasing poultry , or is purchasing poultry and is following safety precautions , could still be exposed to poultry contaminates via the cart.\n\u201d \u201c It \u2019 s difficult to estimate how much ExPEC exchange can be attributed to person-to-person contact \u201d after the rectum of a poultry consumer has been colonized .\nResearchers swabbed public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , collecting more than a thousand samples from 56 public restrooms in 33 establishments .\nAs you can see in the graph below and at 3:07 in my video , they found a lot of evidence of E. coli in general , but particularly in restrooms at public parks and fast-food joints\u2014even more so than gas stations , which surprised me .\nWhat was really unexpected for me , though , was that women \u2019 s restrooms were worse than men \u2019 s !\nOnly about 1 percent of the samples the researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , but they were recovered from sites that were not associated with toilets and were not visibly contaminated .\nSo , one might come into contact with ExPEC bacteria with their bare hands after turning off a faucet after washing their hands , for example .\nIn this way , the risk \u201c could not be fully eliminated by careful hand washing or avoidance of fecal-appearing debris \u201d \u2014though it \u2019 s probably a good idea to avoid that anyway .\nUsing hand sanitizers after exiting the restroom , not to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package of poultry , may offer additional protection .\nWhat proportion of the seven million bladder infections\u2014a common form of urinary tract infection ( UTI ) \u2014every year in the United States is caused by chicken meat ?\n\u201c If no more chicken were consumed , how many E. coli UTIs would be prevented and how much would the prevalence decline ?\n\u201d It \u2019 s hard to tell because of the \u201c time lag between the acquisition and asymptomatic colonization of the intestine with an ExPEC organism and the development of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken today , but the UTI-causing ExPEC bacteria may hang out in your colon for months before making their way into your bladder and triggering an infection .\nThe reason we know it can take that long is by studying the intestinal population dynamics of UTI-causing E. coli between partners .\nIncreased rectum-to-rectum transfers \u201c might be explained by the high levels of E. coli present in the urine of an infected woman , increasing the probability of transmission via direct contact.\n\u201d That is , the E. coli could then be transferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate practices , such as cunnilingus .\nThe bottom line ?\nThere is \u201c compelling evidence that retail meat , particularly poultry , serves as an important reservoir for human exposure to antibiotic-resistant E. coli that is causing UTIs .\nThus , the term foodborne UTIs or FUTIs has been adopted to describe these infections.\n\u201d Certainly , we could decrease the burden of these foodborne bladder infections by developing some sort of ExPEC vaccine , but why not just reduce our contact with fresh or frozen poultry ?\nNo harm , no @ @ @ @

roasting .\nCaffeine is pretty stable , but a dark roast may wipe out nearly 90 percent of the chlorogenic acid content of the beans .\nThe difference between a medium light roast and a medium roast

source of vitamin B12 . )\nAll we needed was a randomized , controlled trial , and we got one : Type 2 diabetics were randomized to the macrobiotic diet versus the recommended American Diabetes Association-type diet .\nYou can see an example of a typical day on the macrobiotic diet below and at 2:59 in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cake for breakfast ; brown rice sesame balls for a snack ; a vegetable millet soup with a brown rice salad , a lot of vegetable sides , and adzuki beans for lunch ; more whole grain snacks ; and , similar to lunch , a dinner of vegetable barley soup with a lot of vegetables and chickpeas ; and green tea throughout the day .\nOn the more standard diabetic diet , participants might have low-fat milk and whole-wheat bread for breakfast ; a Mediterranean lunch with vegetables and beans ; fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vegetable soup , whole-grain bread , agretti ( a green leafy vegetable ) , and baked fish for dinner .\nI have to say , that \u2019 s a pretty healthy control diet .\nThe researchers could have compared the macrobiotic diet to a trashy one , but they wanted to stack it up against the diet diabetes groups recommend .\nSo , what happened ?\nThe macrobiotic diet won out on every measure of blood sugar control .\nYou can view the numbers in the graph below and at 4:00 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study , participants had fasting blood sugars in the 120s .\nThat \u2019 s bad , but they were diabetics , after all .\nNormal fasting blood sugars , like when you wake up in the morning before having breakfast , should be at least in the double digits and under 100 .\nWhen subjects were put on the relatively healthy , more standard diabetic diet , their blood sugars got better over the three-week study , dropping from the 120s down into the 110s .\n( That \u2019 s the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . )\nCompare that to an isocaloric macrobiotic diet , meaning with the same number of calories .\nOn the macrobiotic diet , subjects improved within days and achieved normal fasting blood sugars within a week .\nA full 100 percent of those on the macrobiotic diet got their fasting blood sugars under 110 , whereas less than half of those on the diabetes diet did .\nAnd , that was achieved while on fewer drugs .\nIn the control group , one participant was able to reduce their oral hypoglycemic medications , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs in the macrobiotic group had to stop taking them .\nOtherwise , if they had continued taking the drugs , their blood sugars would have fallen too low .\nSo , the macrobiotic diet gave better results on fewer drugs .\nThat \u2019 s the power of a really healthy diet .\nAs an aside , what a poke in the eye with a sharp stick this study was to the low-carb crowd !\nResearchers took diabetics and put them on a 73 percent carbohydrate diet , adding 100 grams of carbs\u2014in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their daily diet .\nAnd what happened ?\nDid their blood sugars skyrocket out of control ?\nNo , they got significantly better in a matter of days , with average fasting blood sugars starting out at 129 and falling to 95 .\nAnd , in just three weeks , their bad LDL cholesterol plummeted down to 62 , a nearly 48 percent drop .\nIs the macrobiotic diet perfect ?\nNo , but I offer some suggestions for improving it in my video Flashback Friday : Pros and Cons of a Macrobiotic @ @", "author": "Michael Greger M.D. FACLM", "url":

put it to the test .\nThey had some anecdotal evidence that dates might be helpful , but they wanted to know for sure \u201c whether the addition of date fruit for the last few weeks of pregnancy would reduce the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d which is when drugs are administered to induce uterine contractions to either initiate or accelerate labor .\nIt \u2019 s one of the most commonly

financial incentives and other reasons to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not help with those factors , but might they help foster a normal , spontaneous delivery ?\nIn a prospective study , women either ate six

higher proportion of intact membranes , which is a good thing .\nAnd , with significantly fewer drugs administered , \u201c spontaneous labour occurred in 96 % of those who consumed dates , compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit consumers.\n\u201d What \u2019 s more , labor for those in the date group was also shorter\u2014about seven hours shorter overall .\nTherefore , \u201c it is concluded that the

give dates a try since there doesn \u2019 t seem to be a downside , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI want to know if they actually work , but we didn \u2019 t get a randomized , controlled trial until

worse comes to worst , surgery could be necessary .\nWhy not try fruit first ?\nDates are readily available , inexpensive , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up a randomized clinical trial to find out .\nImmediately after their placenta came out , women were given a one-time dose of either five or so dates or an intramuscular shot of oxytocin .\nThen , the researchers collected all of the blood to

skyrocketing number of energy drink-related emergency room visits over recent years .\nYou can see below a graph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video Are There Risks to Energy Drinks ?\n.\nHowever , if you look at

alcohol inebriation , enabling an individual to believe they can still safely consumer more alcohol , leading to \u2018 awake drunkenness.\n\u2019 \u201d And , since because energy drinks are often

risky behaviors , as you can see below and at 1:07 in my video .\nSo , the only way to tease out the energy drink component is to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concerns that has been raised by public health advocates in terms of potential negative effects is increased blood pressure .\nA half hour after study participants chugged an 8-ounce can of Red Bull , researchers found no significant change in blood pressure , though .\nWhat about a big 16-ounce can of Red Bull ?\nForty minutes after consumption of the larger can with double the volume , still no significant change was found , so concerns about energy drinks raising blood pressure were dismissed as overblown .\nThat is , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bull does significantly raise blood pressure after all .\nThe reason it was missed by the earlier studies is because the spike doesn \u2019 t begin peaking until about an hour after consumption , as you can see in the graph below and at 1:59 in my video .\nSo , if you look at blood pressure levels 30 and even 40 minutes after consumption , everything seems fine , but the worst is yet to come .\nAnd , the big shocker was that cerebral blood flow velocity\u2014that is , velocity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEnergy drinks are promoted as having \u201c beneficial effects on body and mental strength , \u201d but this instead would suggest they \u2019 re \u201c potentially harmful because

that those drinking the energy drink had a higher \u201c QT interval.\n\u201d \u201c QT \u201d ?\nLet me explain , and you can see for yourself below and at 3:30 in my video .\nOn an EKG , a QT interval is the distance from the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bump of the T wave .\nThis is relevant because QT prolongation , which is what was caused by the energy drink but not the caffeinated beverage consumed by the control group , is \u201c a recognized marker of increased risk for fatal arrhythmias \u201d \u2014that is , fatal heart rhythms .\nThat doesn \u2019 t sound good , but by how much ?\n\u201c Prolongation of the QT\u2026interval by more than 60 ms [ milliseconds ] \u2026is a marker for life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\u201d The energy drink only prolonged it by about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs\u2014profitable drugs bringing in billions of dollars\u2014have been pulled from the market because they caused a 5- to 10-millisecond prolongation .\nSo , we really need to start investigating some of these other ingredients in energy drinks .\nIn 2008 , for example , authorities found cocaine in Red Bull drinks , but the \u201c Red Bull manufacturers insisted that active cocaine was removed from the coca leaf during processing and that the extract was used for flavoring.\n\u201d For more on energy drinks , see my video Are There Benefits of Energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @

"title": "Are Energy Drinks Beneficial?", "content": "What effects do Red Bull and Monster brand energy drinks have on artery function and athletic performance ?\nGiven the \u201c global popularity \u201d of the multibillion-dollar energy drink industry , it is critical we determine if the beverages have any \u201c potential adverse effects , \u201d as I discuss in my video Are There Benefits of Energy Drinks ?\n.\n\u201c There are currently more than 500 energy drink products available on the market \u201d today .\n\u201c The most popular , and the most studied , \u201d is Red Bull .\nA single can has been found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 points within 90 minutes of consumption , as you can see in the graph below and at 0:27 in my video .\nWhat about all the other energy drinks ?\nStudies show they similarly increase blood pressure by 3 to 4 points on average .\nIs a 3- to 4-point bump really a big deal ?\nI \u2019 d say so .\nIf you have elevated blood pressure day in and day out , that bump means a 20 percent higher risk of dying from a stroke and a 12 percent higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nCan Red Bull increase your day-long average blood pressure ?\nResearchers put it to the test : \u201c Comparison of the Effects of Energy Drink Versus Caffeine Supplementation on\u202624-Hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure.\n\u201d The Food and Drug Administration imposes a limit on caffeine in soda .\nEnergy drink manufacturers get around this by claiming their carbonated sugar water beverages are not sodas , but \u201c natural dietary supplements.\n\u201d Red Bull doesn \u2019 t have any more caffeine than a cup of coffee , but what are the effects of all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy drink ?\nResearchers gave study participants four small cans of Red Bull or four cups of coffee , each containing the same amount of caffeine .\nTheir blood pressures were measured over the course of the entire day .\nEven though the Red Bull contained the same amount of caffeine as the coffee , it resulted in significantly higher average blood pressure\u2014about five points higher , compared to coffee .\nIs it the taurine or some other combination of added ingredients in energy drinks that makes them so harmful ?\nEnergy drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see in the graph below and at 1:55 in my video , drinking just one big can of Monster Energy has been shown to lead to a significant drop in our arteries \u2019 ability to relax normally within just 90 minutes of consumption .\nThe biggest risk , though , is likely the EKG changes that signal an increase in the risk of our hearts flipping into a fatal rhythm .\nThere are cases of young people suffering cardiac arrest after consuming seven or eight cans in a row , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other .\nSome people are just more susceptible .\n\u201c There are a number of case reports in the literature highlighting multiple potentially fatal cardiac side effects from high-energy drinks in the general population , and the overall toxic effects of energy drinks are being reported more frequently.\n\u201d But , at the highest risk are the families with a history of sudden cardiac death or fainting .\nEducating this population about the risks is even more critical , as energy drinks may unmask Long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in about 1 in 2,000 people .\nThere are safety issues , certainly , but do the benefits outweigh the risks ?\nUnfortunately , \u201c little evidence exists in the literature to support beneficial effects of energy drinks.\n\u201d What about for athletes ?\nEnergy drinks were originally marketed to them , and , boy , did that marketing work !\nEighty percent of college athletes reportedly drink them .\nDo they help their athletic performance ?\nResearchers determined that \u201c preexercise energy drink consumption does not improve endurance , \u201d but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simulated 25-mile cycling road race , they could not find any athletic performance\u2013enhancing potential for Red Bull above that of just sugar water and caffeine .\nIn addition , the data indicated Red Bull \u201c induced greater inflammatory-related responses \u201d than straight caffeinated sugar water or placebo .\nIt wasn \u2019 t a flop only for endurance sports ; there was no apparent effect on resistance training either .\nThose hoping energy drinks will help rev up their metabolism to lose weight may be disappointed to learn you can get the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may cheer up quickly when they realize black coffee or tea is much cheaper than cans of energy drinks .\nNo wonder there was no change in athletic performance : Unlike nitrate-rich vegetables , energy drinks don \u2019 t change oxygen utilization or ratings of perceived exertion .\nThey do , however , raise your resting blood pressure , as you can see at 4:13 in my video .\nThis is the opposite effect of vegetables , like beets and greens , both of which improve athletic performance and reduce blood pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks have no therapeutic benefit.\n\u201d For more on this QT thing that I referenced above , see my video Are There Risks to Energy Drinks ?\n.\nIf you have questions about sports
