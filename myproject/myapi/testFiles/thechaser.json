screeches and caterwauling of your uncooperative infant .\nI \u2019 d suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infant in question in a bid to shut him up .\n3 .\nYour Child Has Been Kidnapped What better way to take in the news that your child has been abducted , quite possibly by an organised pedophile ring , than with a drop of the Hahndorf Hill Gruner Veltliner GRU 2014 , which was recently described by James Halliday as \u201c a perfect expression of post-kidnap anxiety.\n\u201d It \u2019 s drinking very well now , but is sure to take on even greater depth and roundness in eight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept that your child \u2019 s not coming back .\n4 .\nYour Child Does A Massive Poo In The Supermarket It doesn \u2019 t really matter what you drink with this particular situation \u2013 it won \u2019 t do anything to improve it .\nMy tip is to skull an entire bottle of tequila and hope that you pass out before the staff at the supermarket can identify you as the parent .\n5 .\nYou Lose Your Child In
