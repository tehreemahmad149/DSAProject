puppetmasters who keep the masses distracted with their perpetual wars have finally turned their focus away from foreign bogeymen .\nInstead , they have used a virus \u2014 one that apparently will not or can not die \u2014 to finally launch the World War III many of us have feared and predicted for a very long time .\nIn America , and all over the world , governments began overstepping any legitimate authority last year , when their lockdowns , social distancing , and mandates created massive loss of jobs and small businesses , and an unthinkable diminishment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety is a far more powerful weapon than conventional false flags and demonization of other nations and their leaders .\nThe masses want to be safe , and they have shown they are willing to sacrifice liberty for it .\nIt probably wasn \u2019 t a difficult adjustment for citizens in China and other totalitarian societies to obey nonsensical mandates to such a degree that close family ties could be severed , or long time friendships broken .\nBut here in the US , in the land of the supposedly free , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have at least questioned this absurd narrative .\nInstead , the vast majority bought each contradictory pronouncement , and genuflected towards science , in whose name WWIII is being waged .\n\u201c In God We Trust \u201d has been replaced by \u201c Trust the Science \u201d !\nLet us briefly summarize the Fort Sumpter moments here .\nCOVID-19 was the 2019 strain of the yearly coronavirus , which is essentially the common cold .\nAll viruses , the hallowed Science tells us , run their course and burn out in the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they return every fall .\nBut COVID-19 was different from any previous virus in history .\nIt didn \u2019 t burn out .\nAnd it didn \u2019 t allow COVID-20 to appear on the scene last fall , as Science tells us it should have .\nIsn \u2019 t that kind of like the sun suddenly not setting in the West ?\nSo COVID-20 never emerged .\nWhat happened to it ?\nAnd now we should be seeing COVID-21 .\nInstead , the invulnerable COVID-19 just stays .\nAnd stays .\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow to it , but it basically has been a constant presence in the world for two years now .\nThat isn \u2019 t Science .\nInstead of the old coronavirus dying out , as it has always done , and a new one replacing it every fall , COVID-19 simply spawns new variants , which is about as meaningful a term as mandates.Now we are told that the deadly new African variant Omicron has terrifying potential for our already frightened world .\nExactly how much fear can the elite sell , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it ?\nIsn \u2019 t that the way all drugs work ?\nJust as junkies need more powerful highs to satisfy their addiction , doesn \u2019 t it stand to reason that those you \u2019 re trying to scare for your own nefarious purposes would need a higher dose of fear at some point in order to achieve the same effect ?\nAnd thus the variants , each one more dark and dangerous than the one before .\nJust consider everything that people who have bought into this absurd narrative have accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was literally pulled out of the air , adapted from a middle school girl \u2019 s science project .\nHow many loved ones have gone unhugged and unkissed over the past nearly two years , because of this level of Science ?\nAnd the face diapers .\nI believe at this point , some people are only keeping the masks on because they like the look of it .\nNothing displays servitude more than a ridiculous mask that protects you from nothing , least of all this very dubious virus .\nLike many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , and even some family , because of what I \u2019 ve said and written about this quiet overt Plandemic .\nHow many questioned wearing a mask into a restaurant , only to take it off when they got to the safety of their table ?\nHow many questioned the plexiglass put up between customers and cashiers , which was open on the sides , the top , and the bottom ?\nThis is Science ?\nHow many protested the forced closure of small businesses selling the same products as their large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions whatsoever ?\nBut the madness was taken to another level entirely with the magical warp speed vaccine .\nDonald Trump pushed for it , and continues to brag about it and claim credit for it .\nAnd yet his supporters are overwhelmingly skeptical about it , while those who still irrationally hate him see no inconsistency in embracing the vaccine like a Holy Grail while spewing vitriol against the father of it .\nThe mysteries of the disastrous Two-Party duopoly are endless and largely responsible for the mess we \u2019 re in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those all over the world lined up for the jab as soon as it was available , they soon discovered that just one shot wasn \u2019 t enough .\nA second injection was required .\nAnd now we are being introduced to a never-ending stream of boosters , supposedly to protect you from these variants .\nBasically , you are getting multiple vaccines for the same thing , something unheard of and about as unscientific as could be .\nWe were primed for this .\nAmericans have been dumbed down for decades .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistently for over forty years .\nI suppose that a similar dumbing down has taken place all over the world because the majority of the population in every nation are being injected with multiple jabs for the same virus .\nThe media has absolutely forbidden exposure of all the deaths and adverse reactions to these vaccines that have undeniably occurred .\nAlready they have killed far more people than all the other vaccines since 1901 combined .\nAnd heart disease in children is becoming a real thing now , thanks to gullible parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoting the jab .\nIt \u2019 s well known that Science \u2014 the deity around which this entire narrative revolves \u2014 has found that COVID-19 presents absolutely no danger to the young , especially small children .\nIn fact , the minuscule chance they could die from the common flu is still more likely than anything happening to them because of this unprecedented COVID virus .\nAnd yet , the Woke Left continues to push for stringent mask mandates and vaccination of children .\nAny dissenting parents will be slandered as \u201c domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaunted FBI .\nSo , this is World War III .\nThe sides are clearly aligned .\nIt is us versus them , with them being the elite leaders , movers , and shakers of every nation on Earth .\nThe oldest war ever waged is the class war , there are obvious class distinctions in our current battle .\nAlmost everyone with any appreciable wealth or influence is buying this narrative as religiously as they buy into anything promulgated by the rigged system that has served them so well .\nAnd the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to at least some degree to the utter corruption and tyranny ruling them .\nBut the powerless and unconnected , living paycheck to paycheck if they have a job , are for the most part buying this Plandemic narrative , too .\nSo by default , our side loses even more millions of potential partisans to the apathy and stupidity that enables the bullies who are orchestrating this production .\nThey can be easily identified by their trusty masks , which constitute a sort of military uniform .\nThey are the ones who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPicture Donald Sutherland \u2019 s character in the 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers , pointing and yelling at the last human character , his former friend .\nOnly we can \u2019 t blame aliens .\nWhen we envisioned another World War , conservatives imagined the primary adversary \u2014 the \u201c bad guy \u201d \u2014 would be China .\n\u201c Woke \u201d liberals pictured it being Russia .\nThere are so few anti-war voices left in the world that their dreams of universal peace aren \u2019 t even taken into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , wars are never about enemies .\nThey \u2019 re about opportunities for profit .\nBut few of us pictured a World War III precipitated by what real statistics , and real Science , tell us is an ordinary and innocuous virus .\nIn all those science fiction films depicting an overwhelming catastrophe impacting humankind , from giant bugs or dinosaurs unearthed by nuclear testing to horrific contagions turning people into zombies , the scientists who knew what was happening , and tried to warn the people , were scoffed at .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ are selling this Plandemic , like used car salesmen in white coats .\nAnd while those movies were great entertainment , there is no joy in experiencing it for real .\nUnlike every other war in world history , this one really doesn \u2019 t involve what we classically define as weapons .\nAs I have said many times , the entire world was essentially shut down in a matter of a few weeks , without any troops or police being necessary to do so .\nWithout a shot being fired .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orwellian World War , Them still doesn \u2019 t need any weapons .\nOther than the power of a sycophant , state-controlled press , and high profile One Percenters anxious to propagandize .\nUs , on the other hand , are not really even in the battle .\nThey don \u2019 t know that a war is going on .\nAlthough they theoretically have weapons , none have dared to use them .\nThe law \u2014 from roided out police officers to biased and politicized judges \u2014 is allied with Them .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as valuable to Them as an arsenal of pinpoint-accurate drones .\nThe entire corporate world and gargantuan government bureaucracy is also aligned with Them .\nUs has nothing , beyond a dwindling number of alternative media outlets that are being systematically eliminated by Them .\nAmerica \u2019 s secession from British colonial rule was only possible because those who were front and center in the fight for independence were the One Percenters of their day .\nThose of Us who object to this tyrannical Plandemic narrative have no fortunes to risk .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because honor has no value in our nightmarish world .\nThey are welcome to risk their lives , as countless whistleblowers and naysayers opposed to various conspiracies have over the course of time .\nThe only weapon us has is a tremendous advantage in numbers .\nLike Orwell \u2019 s Proles , us could bring them to task at any moment , simply by banning together .\nBut we are a totally dysfunctional country , and that dysfunction is most apparent in virtually every family .\nSadly , millions of people coming together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would greatly benefit from is a pipedream .\nSo World War III will not feature the millions of deaths from the previous world wars .\nThe casualties are likely to be all the unreported victims of an untested and dangerous vaccine , or perhaps a real deadly pathogen will ultimately be released , and the deranged eugenicists who rule us can finally satisfy their fantasies .\nIt will instead be a relentless assault on human liberty , morality , and all that \u2019 s worth living for .\nAnd it will be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWorld War III also contains a strong element of psychological warfare , with the elite refining the methods they \u2019 ve used for over a century on the always unwitting public .\nThe concept of Total War , first implemented by secular deity Abraham Lincoln and his bloodthirsty Union generals , has been extended to include modern , Pavlovian techniques that target the citizens of each country with fear porn and largely meaningless quasi-scientific terms , instead of the typical collateral damage inflicted by indiscriminate bombing of civilians .\nTo paraphrase an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy , and it \u2019 s them .\nWhy bother manufacturing foreign adversaries when you can simply trample your own population ?\nInstead of machine guns or bombs , use mandates and variants .\nNo need to travel thousands of miles to confront an alleged terrorist or dictator .\nJust demonize all those who question your authority .\nMake your political opponents the terrorists .\nThe same masses who bought all those false flags , and the demonization of various hobgoblins in other countries , will buy anything you \u2019 re selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrified over this absurd Plandemic have always cheered on every war .\nThey \u2019 ve been conditioned to support the troops , and salivate for the chance to thank you for your service , even if that service is now directed against domestic dissidents .\nSo they are unconditionally behind World War III , even though they \u2019 re in the crossfire , and on the losing side , that has no real weapons with which to defend itself .\nOutside of their sizable advantage in numbers , that is .\nWhich they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t expect many of the few genuine anti-war activists left in this country to join me in opposing this war , or even acknowledging it exists .\nI \u2019 ve written a book about bullying , and war requires bullying behavior to be successful .\nI will always oppose bullies , just as I oppose war .\nI agree with Jeannette Rankin , a forgotten classical liberal , who called war \u201c a wrong method of trying to settle a dispute.\n\u201d She also said , \u201c You can no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an earthquake.\n\u201d When they wanted to put a woman on the currency , it \u2019 s not surprising that no one mentioned her .\nIf anything , this war \u2013 World War III \u2013 is the most insidious one ever .\nGovernments overtly declaring war on their own people , with most of the people cooperating with the governments .\nAs Benjamin Franklin once said , \u201c There is no such thing as a good war or a bad peace.\n\u201d That certainly includes this

intended to blanket the ENTIRE country with 5G small cells placed between every 2 to 10 homes .\nThe industry claims they need so many towers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small distances and can be easily blocked by

I wrote on Substack , my older brother Ricky called me in the early afternoon from the hospital .\nHe said he had fallen out of bed , but couldn \u2019 t explain how .\nHe called 911 and of course , the first thing they did when he entered the hospital was to give him a COVID test .\nJust as predicted , it came back positive .\nRicky had no symptoms whatsoever .\nHe was perfectly healthy .\nThere were no injuries from the fall .\nInstead of sending him home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , they immediately began tests .\nTests are the lifeblood of our horrific Medical Industrial Complex .\nLike corrupt car repair shops , they have to find something to stay in business .\nWithin a day or two , they had amended his diagnosis to COVID pneumonia .\nHe still sounded pretty normal , and I wasn \u2019 t that alarmed .\nOnce the COVID diagnosis was made , there was no chance for me to see my brother .\nThe hospital permitted no visitors to COVID patients .\nEventually , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the phone , because the machines in the room made it hard for him to hear what I was saying .\nSo there was little I could do .\nI told two different doctors and two different nurses that I absolutely forbid the use of Remdesivir .\nThey argued but agreed to go with my wishes .\nOn January 18 , I discovered that they had begun giving him Remdesivir against my explicit instructions , on January 15 .\nThat just happened to coincide with when Ricky began to really spiral downwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , but obviously , the damage had already been done .\nThey also refused my request to give him Ivermectin .\nI was told , \u201c Ivermectin isn \u2019 t allowed at this facility.\n\u201d He died on January 20 , my niece \u2019 s birthday .\nMy brother \u2019 s death was so unexpected , so head-scratching , that it was essentially as if he \u2019 d just dropped dead .\nTo go from being healthier than the vast majority of seventy-three-year-old men , to dead in two weeks is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were supposed to be caring for him .\nHow does that possibly happen ?\nWhat kind of \u201c care \u201d essentially kills someone in two weeks ?\nThe idea behind a hospital stay is that you \u2019 re in the ideal hands- professionals who know best .\nThere is zero doubt in my mind that my brother would be alive and well today if he \u2019 d never called 911 that morning .\nThe hospital stay killed him , not any deadly virus .\nThey saw a seventy-three-year-old guy , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their $ 13,000 bonus for a COVID diagnosis .\nAnd his non-vaxxed status assured that he \u2019 d be fast-tracked for death .\nFamily members have had the classlessness to blame his death on the fact he didn \u2019 t get the vaccine .\nAnd to essentially hold me responsible for him not being vaccinated .\nRicky \u2019 s death would have devastated me regardless because I was basically his caretaker .\nHe had mental and emotional issues that were never really quantified , but he definitely needed someone to look out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut the fact he died supposedly from COVID-19 , the psyop I \u2019 ve written and talked so much about , makes it even harder to deal with .\nI \u2019 m sure there are those out there- probably even within my own family- snickering , \u201c See , he said it was a hoax , and now his brother \u2019 s dead from it.\n\u201d Maybe if I \u2019 d been able to visit him during those two weeks , and to understand what was happening to him , I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last time I saw him was on Sunday , January 2 , when we had our weekly ritual of lunch at Red Lobster .\nI had grown to love that ritual , and he did , too .\nI will probably not be able to eat at Red Lobster again .\nAt any rate , that was it .\nEighteen days later he was dead , from a virus that I firmly believe has been politicized and never isolated or concretely identified .\nActually , I did see Ricky again , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in the morning and said that now I could visit him since he was in the end-of-life stage .\nQuite a policy there- you can see your loved one when they \u2019 re about to die .\nAfter being required to don three masks , a face shield , a patient gown , and gloves , my wife and I spent three agonizing hours in his room , watching him slowly wither away .\nI told him I loved him a hundred times , but he showed no cognizance that we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said goodbye to the sibling I was closest to and had by far the closest relationship with .\nMy life was intertwined with him in a multitude of ways , which becomes clearer as I go through all his papers and settle his affairs .\nIt \u2019 s frightening to consider that life can be lost , on the basis of an unnecessary 911 call , and a bogus PCR test that yields a 90 percent false-positive rate .\nThat \u2019 s all it took , along with a policy that forbids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly involved .\nI don \u2019 t know how many doctors and nurses are actual monsters .\nMaybe they believe they \u2019 re providing the best treatment possible .\nThey certainly trust what their education , and the medical establishment , tell them .\nBut while they may not be monsters , the system they serve- the Medical Industrial Complex- is monstrous .\nMedical practitioners are the third leading cause of death in America .\nHospitals kill more people than anything except cancer and heart disease .\nI spent forty-four years working for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than enough material to write a book about it .\nI heard nurses mutter \u201c I wish he \u2019 d die \u201d in response to some poor soul screaming in agony .\nI saw a nurse joke with a surgeon about \u201c not trying too hard \u201d before operating on a child because her unit was already filled with patients .\nI heard constant tales of surgeons leaving scalpels inside patients , or operating on the wrong limb- that \u2019 s why they circle what area is to be operated on now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you \u2019 d expect of \u201c the best and brightest ?\n\u201d I have stayed away from doctors as much as I can .\nMy brother , on the other hand , made appointments for the slightest imaginable malady , had regular blood work done , and was up for any and every test they proposed .\nHe put his trust in them , and they ultimately failed him in the most tragic way possible .\nFrom what I \u2019 ve seen of \u201c healthcare professionals , \u201d one would be better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t heal ; they create permanent patients , addicted to the poisons of Big Pharma .\nI keep fantasizing about going back in time , to the morning my brother fell out of bed somehow and stopping him from calling 911 .\nWould he have developed COVID or cold/flu symptoms ?\nI \u2019 ll never know .\nAnd that is the hardest thing to accept .\nWhat really triggered things will remain a mystery .\nHis heart was fine , as were all his other vital organs .\nHe didn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHe didn \u2019 t even have a trace of arthritis .\nHe never smoke or drank , or ate fried foods ; Ricky was incredibly careful about his health .\nYesterday , when my wife and I went back for the second time to clean out his apartment , the guy in the apartment next to him asked about Ricky .\nHe was shocked to hear he \u2019 d passed away , but he volunteered information that just makes this all the more bizarre .\nHe claimed that he heard a commotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my brother was arguing with the EMTs , saying he never called them and was fine .\nRicky never said anything to me about this , so I have no idea what it means .\nBut it adds yet another layer to the puzzlement which consumes me .\nWhat isn \u2019 t a mystery is how quickly my brother deteriorated in one of our wondrous , highly rated medical facilities .\nIf we had an honest legal system , the medical profession would be looking at the biggest class-action lawsuit in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families of all those \u201c COVID \u201d patients who were murdered by Remdesivir and ventilators .\nThe Medical Industrial Complex , like every other part of our thoroughly corrupt Banana Republic ( including that legal system ) needs to be held accountable .\nTo understand what we \u2019 re up against , look at television commercials .\nHow many aren \u2019 t advertising pharmaceutical products ?\nThey are sickening ; \u201c Tell your doctor.\n\u201d \u201c Ask your doctor.\n\u201d \u201c Check with your doctor.\n\u201d And then they list every awful side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unworthy \u201c professionals \u201d in this country that have been institutionally idolized , none deserve it less than doctors .\nThey are largely a pompous , unfriendly , and unsympathetic group .\nAnd they kill people every day with their mistakes .\nYet the public continues to shower them with unwarranted respect .\nHow many Hollywood products , from Dr. Kildare to Marcus Welby , M.D.\n, have extolled the virtues of the purely altruistic doctor , who exists only to save one life after another ?\nHave you ever seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical profession ?\nThat portrayed doctors honestly , by exposing their arrogance and insensitive bedside manner , not to mention their incompetence ?\nThat showed hospital nurses taking forever to answer the calls of patients in need ?\nThat satirized the routine hospital practice of waking a patient up to give them their sleeping pill ?\nMy brother Ricky was killed by the Medical Industrial Complex as surely as if they \u2019 d stabbed him repeatedly , or poisoned his food .\nRemdesivir alone is a killer , and they know it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fauci and his \u201c enemy \u201d Donald Trump , have huge financial interests in it .\nIt \u2019 s too big to fail .\nI know I can \u2019 t do anything to bring my brother back .\nTo hear his voice one more time .\nBut I intend to keep his memory alive , as part of a continuing exposure of what is really going on in hospitals that bear no resemblance to the fictional worlds of programs like ER .\nEven before the Greatest Psyop in the History of the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were awful places to be .\nInattentive nurses , cocky and dismissive doctors , and continuous mistakes on the part of everyone .\nThey almost killed my father once after he had the most routine surgery imaginable , for a deviated septum .\nOn another occasion , when he broke his hip , they put the metal plate put in wrong , and it shredded his muscle and forced another surgery .\nMy sister fell and broke her hip six years ago , and has been in agony ever since .\nHer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be alive .\nBut then again , a hospital almost killed her when she was just thirty years of age , with their negligence and familiar errors .\nMy niece , who has Downs Syndrome , fell and reinjured her broken hip when the nurses took forever to bring her a bedpan .\nWhen my mother was in the hospital once , the nurses kept ignoring her urgent request for a bedpan .\nI went to the nurse \u2019 s station at least three times , demanding to know why they hadn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed .\nSeveral nurses were sitting comfortably at the station- they certainly weren \u2019 t \u201c treating \u201d any patients .\nAnd once you complain about the lack of \u201c service , \u201d the \u201c service \u201d becomes even worse .\nThey mark you down as a troublemaker .\nThe smiles completely disappear .\nWhen my mother died , the bitch at the nursing station \u2019 s first words to us as we stepped off the elevator was a cold , unsmiling , \u201c Do you want an autopsy ?\n\u201d I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medical profession this harshly .\nThey literally never did anything to help my parents , my sister , or my brother .\nEvery time they went into their \u201c care , \u201d my loved ones came out the worse for the wear .\nThose amazing doctors never made them better .\nAmericans have such low expectations for those they entrust with the most important jobs .\nThey don \u2019 t blink when teachers in charge of their child \u2019 s education turn out to be vacuous authoritarians who document their bias on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t seem to care that their political \u201c representatives \u201d don \u2019 t even attempt to represent them .\nAnd they don \u2019 t seem to notice just how often the secular saints portrayed by the likes of George Clooney seem to fail in real life .\nHow often do their patients get worse and die ?\nHow seldom do they actually cure them ?\nMy brother was not supposed to die at seventy-three .\nHe had none of the comorbidities that people of his age usually suffer from .\nI honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 .\nHealthy people do die every day , from accidents , homicides , or suicides .\nMy brother wasn \u2019 t involved in an accident .\nHe certainly didn \u2019 t kill himself .\nHe was , however the victim of a homicide .\nDeath by the Medical Industrial Complex- I \u2019 ll dub it Medicide .\nThat is the only explanation for why he isn \u2019 t alive .\nSure , it \u2019 s necessary to seek medical attention for severe injuries or a broken limb .\nBut \u201c preventative care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Industrial Complex pushes incessantly , is a corrupt money-making scheme .\nThe fact that doctors now can \u2019 t tell patients they \u2019 re overweight- which lies at the heart of most \u201c diseases \u201d treated with Big Pharma products- tells you all you need to know about their professional integrity .\nJust like their willingness to go along with the most unscientific \u201c Woke \u201d proclamations .\nThese same astounding medical superstars have participated in the hideous mutilation of young people who are confused about their \u201c gender.\n\u201d How is injecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some male \u2019 s penis , part of \u201c care \u201d which helps people ?\nHow is it compatible with the Hippocratic Oath ?\nBut then again , the millions of abortions , performed by these same \u201c lifesavers , \u201d attest to their lack of principles and hypocrisy .\nLike our politicians who swear an oath to a Constitution , they don \u2019 t remotely believe in .\nIt \u2019 s really a small step from \u201c sex change \u201d operations to drowning the lungs of patients with a horrific poison like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with corruption before COVID .\nAnd now , all they have to do is give a COVID diagnosis ( and get a financial bonus in the process ) , and no one questions what happens afterward .\nThe average person- like most in my family- will simply say , \u201c he had COVID , \u201d and that turns off all critical thinking .\nWhat did you expect to happen ?\nHe had COVID !\nThose treating COVID patients are heroes !\nCOVID sucks !\nStay safe .\nI am not going to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the untold number of others who entered a hospital and quickly died from \u201c COVID , \u201d may have died in vain .\nBut exposing the truth about what really happened to him , what really happened to all those people , can serve a noble purpose .\nIf it prevents a single person from going through what Ricky did , then it \u2019 s worth it .\nI may not have him with me any longer in this life , but that

t sleep .\nWhile I could not prove it was the radiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved the 5G technology was definitely turned ON .\nThat was 2019 .\nAs we were locking down over the virus , cell towers across the country were going up .\nIn fact , 5G cell tower installation was the only industry that was thriving during the early to mid-2020 .\nWhen it came to appealing net neutrality , Ajit Pai , the former Trump-appointed chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) said that the government had no place in the private sector .\nHowever , when it came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a necessity , it was a requirement .\nFor example , when I recently called Miami-Dade County to try to find out whether they had amplified the 5G signal , I was referred to the federal government .\nIn fact , in 2018 , the FCC initiated the \u201c 5G Fast Plan \u201d to establish the United States \u2019 superiority in the tech race .\nThey intended to blanket the ENTIRE country with 5G small cells placed between every 2 to 10 homes .\nThe industry claims they need so many towers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small distances and can be easily blocked by walls and even foliage .\nTo compensate for this , engineers found ways to convert the waves to beams and intentionally direct them .\nAs part of the 5G Fast Plan , the FCC reformed rules that had been designed decades ago to accommodate small cells .\nThe reforms were designed to ban \u2018 short-sighted \u2019 municipalities who tried to block the deployment of the 5G technology .\nLocal governments were given a reasonable deadline to approve or disapprove small-cell tower applications .\nSmall groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local meetings to fight these eyesores but they don \u2019 t really stand a chance .\nAt best , if the municipalities have money , the 5G poles are moved to another neighborhood .\nOf course , health studies on 5G have not been conducted .\nOn January 19 , the day I got sick with what felt like radiation exposure , flights were suspended to the U.S. , including to Miami , over 5G concerns .\nI threw up three times .\nI had watery stools .\nI felt anxious .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I lost my sense of smell .\nI thought it was the Rona .\nBut I wasn \u2019 t sick with the flu or cold symptoms .\nI had no cough or respiratory issues .\nMy symptoms didn \u2019 t match the Moronic variant .\nOne friend told me , \u2018 you must have gotten the Delta.\n\u2019 I laughed to myself .\nUpon doing research , I also learned that the CDC acknowledges something called Acute Radiation Syndrome .\nCan You See The ( Smart ) Light ?\nDid you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data infrastructure ?\nTwo-way communication can also be done via light signals .\nAnalysts predict the smart lighting market will grow more than 21 % a year between 2018 and 2023 .\nMuch of this growth will be driven by wireless installations \u2013 and the exciting new applications they support .\nThat \u2019 s why one company is putting Bluetooth low energy ( BLE ) technology in their connected components , enabling every fixture to communicate wirelessly with nearby Bluetooth-enabled smartphones .\nWill wireless lighting controls soon be the new normal , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to organizations everywhere ?\nLet \u2019 s recap how all this connects ( pun intended ) .\nWhat if these injections were never \u201c vaccines \u201d against a virus ?\nWhat if instead , the jabs have been a secret nanotech project developed to control the brains of the human population ?\n( Until now , we don \u2019 t know specifically how they can modify our DNA

electronic circuits they are injecting .\nIf they can create transistors , they can also make an identifier like an RFID chip that can ping a number back , once the person is near a radiofrequency ( RF ) field .\nGraphene oxide in the brain creates transistors , and ostensibly its own network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , molecules of GRAPHENE can interact with neurons in the brain in a remote mode using different radiofrequencies ( 5G could be one of these ) .\nCan they also map the brain and transmit and receive INSTRUCTIONS remotely ?\nDo these nano devices and smart biosensors become programmable

Neuralink Experiments Kills 15th MONKEY, Are Humans Next?", "content": "Elon Musk \u2019 s Neuralink brain chip has killed yet another monkey .\nNonetheless , steps toward human testing forge forward .\nIn total , 15 of 23 macaque monkeys have died at the University of California at Davis in a Neuralink-funded project titled Development of a Large-Scale Brain-Machine Interface in Rhesus Macaques .\n\u201c By now , the others may be dead too , \u201d says Ryan Merkley , the director of research advocacy for the Physicians Committee For Responsible Medicine ( PCRM ) .\nMusk \u2019 s company , with the slogan \u2018 breakthrough technology for the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into pigs and sheep to connect their brains with computers via a small receiver .\nThis technology is brought to us courtesy of NanoTech King and former Harvard professor Charles Lieber who awaits sentencing \u2013 not for colluding with the CCP or his more than 66 questionably ethical patents \u2013 but for tax evasion .\nNeuralink , which began experiments in 2017 , has admitted to animal deaths but denies any cruelty .\nIn one 2020 video titled \u201c Animal Care , \u201d employees affirm that pigs are treated properly .\nHowever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a featured hog that looks mangled , with a horrific vertical scar down his forehead .\nIt \u2019 s macabre and sickening .\nVeterinary records obtained by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine ( PCRM ) , a US non-profit that advocates alternatives to animal testing , describe monkeys picking at their cranial implants post-surgery only to be given drugs such as Simbadol , a high-concentration narcotic buprenorphine formulation , to prevent that action .\nWhile the animals are under anesthesia , they are hooked up to \u201c electrophysiology hardware \u201d to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkeys in this experiment underwent \u201c multiple major survival surgical procedures , \u201d including as many as 10 craniotomies performed on one animal .\nNeuralink has a $ 1.4 million contractual agreement with the University of California Davis .\nIn response to a FOIA public record request by PCRM , UC Davis withheld almost all documents , claiming it was in the \u201c public interest \u201d to do so .\nActually , the truth will literally make you physically ill. After PCRM filed an initial public records lawsuit in May 2021 , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents , including animal use protocols and amendments , health records , surgical logs , necropsy reports , and other documents related to the use of monkeys in invasive brain experiments .\nIn the lawsuit , the committee also alleges that the school declined to release photos and videos of the experiments , saying the records belong to Neuralink , a private company not subject to California \u2019 s Public Records Act .\nAccording to PCRM , Neuralink visited the university and copied the photos and videos , and then deleted them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from PCRM , went on to say , \u201c We believe UC Davis is in possession of photos , but it claims videos were removed by Neuralink and never technically in the possession of the university .\nWe \u2019 re arguing that those videos were created using public resources with the help of public employees , so they should be subject to our records request.\n\u201d In February 2022 , PCRM filed a second public records lawsuit to compel the university to release videos and photographs of the monkeys used in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter referencing the violations to the US Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) and requested an investigation into what are \u201c apparent egregious violations of the Animal Welfare Act.\n\u201d The USDA \u2019 s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has confirmed that it will look into the invasive , fatal monkey experiments .\nFor what it \u2019 s worth , I also witnessed what I consider to be animal cruelty at U.C .\nDavis in 2009 while documenting artificial insemination of queen bees for my film Vanishing of the Bees , narrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entomology lab , the scientist admitted she had inseminated a queen with watered-down coffee instead of semen , just for the camera .\nI was aghast .\nI had been an unwitting accomplice to the unnecessary prying open of a queen bee \u2019 s vagina to mechanically inject her .\nIn the Neuralink experiments , the egregious violations included removing portions of a monkeys \u2019 skull and inserting electrodes into its brain .\nAdditionally , to fill in \u2018 dead space from cracking the skull , \u2019 they used an FDA-approved \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing at least two monkeys by destroying portions of their brain .\nWhen I researched the details about BioGlue , I learned it contains glutaraldehyde and bovine serum albumin that , when combined together , supposedly make an excellent adhesive by creating strong protein cross-linking bonds .\nDoes anyone care that it also causes tissue toxicity and should not be allowed to come in contact with nerves ?\nIt appears that once you get the rubber stamp of approval , the particulars are not scrutinized .\nIn addition to inserting a toxic adhesive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monkeys were caged alone with steel posts screwed to their skulls , leading to facial trauma and seizures .\nThey experienced recurring infections at implant sites and were dosed with large quantities of antibiotic prescriptions .\nIn some cases , Neuralink and U.C .\nDavis euthanized the monkeys before they were even used in the experiment .\nThat means , due to infection and failing health , they were killed before the experiments even got started .\nI wonder if the U.C .\nDavis and Neuralink employees casually discussed their invasive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Monkey MindPong Bar , Neuralink \u2019 s hang-out spot .\nThe bar was named in light of Neuralink \u2019 s claim that Pager , a male macaque monkey , can play Pong \u2013 a computer game \u2013 using his mind .\nPager could move a cursor on-screen without using a joystick .\nNeuralink said this was achieved after one of their chips fed the information from the monkey \u2019 s neurons into a decoder .\nApparently , this is nothing new .\nNeuroscientists have been using neurofeedback for years .\nI have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain .\nOne does not need to perform brain surgery to make this happen .\nNeuralink \u2019 s gross experiments continue in at least two private Neuralink facilities : one in Fremont , California , and one outside of Austin , Texas .\nWhen I learned this , I had a flashback to the movie , Ex-Machina , a sci-fi thriller featuring \u201c ground-breaking \u201d experiments in synthetic intelligence with a highly advanced humanoid artificial intelligence .\nIn 2020 , Musk \u2019 s company opened an in-house 6,000-square-foot \u201c vivarium \u201d to house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared that capturing and using primates for \u2018 science \u2019 is now a boutique industry .\nThe island of Mauritius , for instance , is a source for macaque monkeys .\nAccording to the USDA , 68,257 primates were used in experiments in 2019 ( the latest available stats . )\nNeuralink writes that \u201c all novel medical devices and treatments must be tested in animals before they can be ethically trialed in humans.\n\u201d Yet despite the fact that many monkeys have experienced horrific deaths , Neuralink is moving full-steam ahead in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on humans .\nCase in point : Neuralink is hunting for a Clinical Trial Director to work closely with doctors and engineers to welcome the \u201c first clinical trial participants !\n\u201d ( Note : the exclamation mark is theirs ) .\nThey were also looking for an Algorithms/DSP Engineer to \u2018 accelerate \u2019 pathways \u2018 to human-ready brain implants.\n\u2019 Literal Human Noggin Hackers .\nI assume there are people out there who would literally die to be one of the first test-human in Elon Musk \u2019 s pioneering efforts .\nNeuralink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of regulatory hoops before implanting a device in a human brain .\nYet , with that said , I have personally been approached by people who claim they have Lieber nanotech in their brains .\nWhen I probed ( no pun intended ) further , he responded : Recall that Dr. Yuval Noah Harari , Transhumanist and World Economic Forum ( WEF ) loyalist , recently informed us that : \u201c We are probably one of the last generations of Homo Sapiens because in the coming generations we will learn how to engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now hackable animals , this whole idea that humans have a soul or spirit or free will like when I chose what I want in the supermarket or in the elections because that \u2019 s my free will , that \u2019 s over .\nUnder the Rona Regime , we openly became lab rats .\nIn June 2020 , in the face of the ( fake ) COVID-19 Hegalian-esque emergency , a symposium was held to weigh the pros and cons of bypassing animal trials .\nWhere are the organizations that stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Merkley states , Musk promoted this technology as a way to help people with paralysis and Parkinson \u2019 s , yet Musk also talks about a needed \u201c symbiosis \u201d between human brains and A.I .\nMusk , Harari , and other technocrats have warned that A.I .\ncould trigger the next World War , where super-intelligent robots could dominate the world .\nIn fact , Lieber designed the neural lace \u201c to upgrade the human brain to be more competitive against A.I.\n\u201d Neuralink started with rodents and quickly graduated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Neuralink has experimented with many more than 35 monkeys .\nMankind is next .\nArguably , we are already the

like Joe Biden or Nancy Pelosi .\nAnd he has remained unafraid in his journey to expose the truth .\nMost recently , the archbishop sent a letter to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops ( USCCB ) and the prefect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faith ( CDF ) denouncing how governments and the Catholic Church have responded to coronavirus .\nHe calls it as he sees it : a global conspiracy to control the world population .\nVigano is a prolific letter writer .\nHis 2022 letter is a follow-up of an October 2021 letter , also sent to the USCCB , urging them to consider the moral implications of their stance on encouraging Catholics to get vaccinated .\nVigano cited the lack of clinical trial data , lack of transparency regarding the vaccine components , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modification technology of the Moderna and Pfizer products .\nThe USCCB did not respond to the letter .\nFor several years , he served as a papal nuncio in the role of Vatican ambassador to the United States , until he retired from the role in 2016 .\nHe has been painfully vocal and blunt about the great scandals he sees in the Catholic church .\nVigano is a high-level church insider , Vatican whistleblower , and truth-teller .\nHe became deeply unpopular amongst his peers in 2018 when he provided testimony that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of child molester Archbishop Theodore McCarrick .\nVigano explained that his conscience dictated that he reveal truths about McCarrick , mainly how McCarrick rose to the elite position of Archbishop Emeritus of Washington , D.C. , despite the Church hierarchy being well aware of McCarrick \u2019 s immoral behavior .\nVigano explained that the two nuncios who had preceded him informed the Holy See immediately upon learning of McCarrick \u2019 s crimes , but Rome did nothing .\nBoth archbishops , Gabriel Montalvo and Pietro Sambi , died prematurely .\nVigano kept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope Benedict XVI had banished him from the Church , ordering the priest to \u201c

.\nVigano has been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nHe testified that the pope knew about McCarrick \u2019 s sexual escapades as early as 2013 but covered for him until the bitter end .\nMost recently , Vigano described the Catholic Church as a \u201c deep church where heresy , sodomy , and corruption are all trademarks.\n\u201d He states that the pope has surrounded himself with compromised and blackmailed individuals .\nVigano finds the Church guilty of many social injustices .\nHe has spoken out about everyone , including Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi for their position on abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for endorsing Biden despite his pro-abortion stance , describing Biden as a person who is deeply manipulated by the Deep State .\nVigano also calls out in-name-only Catholic politicians , such as Pelosi and Andrew Cuomo .\nHe called all three out for supporting gender indoctrination and being proudly in favor of the Antifa and Black Lives Matter movements that have set entire American cities on fire .\nHe criticized the Catholic Church for pressuring Catholics into taking the COVID jabs as part of their \u201c moral duty \u201d and has described the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c globalist vulgate \u201d by promoting the vaccine campaigns .\nVigano wrote a Christmas 2021 letter to the American people regarding what he sees as the COVID conspiracy : for two years now , a global coup has been carried out all over the world , planned for some time by an elite group of conspirators enslaved to the interests of international high finance .\nThis coup was made possible by an emergency pandemic that is based on the premise of a virus that has a mortality rate almost analogous to that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delegitimization and prohibition of effective treatments , and on the distribution of an experimental gene serum which is obviously ineffective , and which also clearly carries with it the danger of serious and even lethal side effects .\nWe all know how much the mainstream media has

chronically ill , and imposing forms of control that violate the fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The full letter is available at the American Thinker and the Gateway Pundit .\nVigano even wrote a letter to President Trump in mid-November 2020 , shortly after the election was stolen .\nIn that letter , Vigano wrote : No one\u2026would ever have thought that , in all of our cities , citizens would be arrested simply for wanting to walk down the street , to breathe , to want to keep their businesses open , to want to go to church on Sunday .\nYet now it is happening all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens and believers are being denied in the name of a health emergency that is revealing itself more and more fully as instrumental to the establishment of an inhuman , faceless tyranny .\nNaturally , this letter to Trump was not covered by the mainstream media , some of whom tried to label the 79-year-old Vigano as a QAnon conspirator because he described the elite as using the global health emergency as a means to power and nothing to actually do with the virus .\nVigano stated that \u201c the fate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global conspiracy against God and humanity , \u201d and went on to say that

Own Version of VAERS, And The Results Are Frightening", "content": "On January 24 , Senator Ron Johnson ( R-Wisconsin ) held a round-table discussion on the COVID vaccines and COVID treatment protocols .\nNear the end of the 5-hour discussion , attorney Thomas Renz stunned attendees with data obtained from the Defense Medical Epidemiology Database ( DMED ) .\nThis data was obtained by Renz from three whistleblowers who felt the data must be shared with the general public .\nWhy did the whistleblowers feel so strongly about it ?\nDMED contains anonymized medical data of all US military servicemen and women , and there is overwhelming proof that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here \u2019 s a sample of what the database contains : \u2022 300 % increase in certain cancers , and Put in perspective , Renz explained that between January and November 2021 , neurological disorders jumped from 82,000 to 863,000 .\nLet that sink in .\nTo put the HIV cases into perspective , over the last five years , the military database reported , on average , 454 annual cases .\nBut in the first ten months of 2021 , the number of reported HIV cases jumped to 2,681 .\nAnd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not preventing military men and women from getting the SARS-CoV2 virus , either .\nPercentage increases were compared to the averages over the previous five years of DMED data .\nAttorney Leigh Dundas explained in this video from Dr. Charlie Ward that the data for previous years were relatively constant .\nEven the 2020 data was fairly stagnant ; if COVID-19 were affecting young people , a huge increase due to COVID infection would have been seen in the 2020 data .\nHowever , there were very few changes .\nWhen the vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidence of diseases skyrocketed , increasing a thousand-fold .\nDundas explained that nearly every ICD-10 code increased , except for one \u2013 Chagas disease , an infection seen in members deployed to Mexico , Central America , and South America that is caused by a parasitic transmission from tsetse fly to human .\nDundas and Renz presented evidence that the top military brass is likely covering up the true picture by manipulating DMED data to conceal certain conditions and diseases .\nCase in point : Anxiety had a massive percentage increase in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing heart and other cardiac symptoms possibly indicative of myocarditis .\nMyocarditis cases rose from 127 to 363 , a 285 % increase , but the purportedly scrubbed data represent over a 1000 % increase .\nIncidences of chest pain rose by a whopping 1,529 % and breathing difficulty by 905 % .\nMyocarditis and anxiety are certainly not the same .\nMyocarditis creates permanent heart damage and is certainly career-limiting as well as life-limiting .\nIn stark contrast to the DMED data , CDC only reports three main conditions in adults : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Guillain-Barre syndrome ( GBS ) , and ( 3 ) myocarditis .\nDespite the CDC \u2019 s own admission that 12- to 29-year-old males are most at risk for developing vaccine-induced myocarditis , the military did nothing to protect the vulnerable 18-29 age group of soldiers .\nDMED is the anonymized version of the Department of Defense \u2019 s ( DoD ) premier epidemiological resource that has all the military data , called the Defense Medical Surveillance System ( DMSS ) .\nThis database is considered to be one of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cited in many peer-reviewed journal articles .\nShortly after Renz made his whistleblower information public , the DoD said that they discovered an error in the DMED data .\nWhile they concluded that the 2021 data were accurate , the DoD stated that its data for 2016-2020 was off \u2014 not just off , but off by a factor of 10-fold .\nThis is also interesting , given that no scientist who utilized the data during those years ever found a problem .\nIncredible .\nRenz explains this \u201c data mistake \u201d very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also said he has more whistleblowers coming forth than he knows what to do with .\nHe is building a traunch of irrefutable evidence on Fauci , the CDC , and the FDA .\nRenz and Dundas also stated that the DMED was not likely to be the only government reporting system with questionable practices .\nThey also informed the committee to investigate the Project SALUS , an integrated military-civilian database .\nProject Salus also showed positive evidence regarding natural immunity against any virus variants .\nThese investigators published that the vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lead to an uptick in breakthrough cases .\nHere \u2019 s the full presentation , which has not been made public .\nRenz strongly suggested at Senator Johnson \u2019 s meeting that the DOD and the CDC have been withholding crucial COVID vaccine surveillance data since at least September 2021 .\nRenz and Dundas say that the DMED data , as well as the SALUS data , deserve \u201c independent substantiation \u201d because scientific fraud has occurred.\n\u201d Based on these data , the Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and J & J ) should be revoked , as should the Biologics License Application for Pfizer \u2019 s Comirnaty product

Technology\u00a0Known As The COVID-19 \u201d Vaccines\u201d", "content": "Fast forward to year two of this plandemic .\nOn October 13 , 2021 , a study out of Sweden reported several findings : \u201c The SARS\u2013CoV\u20132 spike protein significantly inhibits DNA damage repair , which is required for effective V ( D ) J recombination in adaptive immunity.\n\u201d \u201c Our findings reveal a potential molecular mechanism by which the spike protein might impede adaptive immunity and underscore the potential side effects of full-length spike-based vaccines.\n\u201d \u201c Mechanistically , we found that the spike protein localizes in the nucleus and inhibits DNA damage repair by impeding key DNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the damage site.\n\u201d \u201c If DNA damage can not be properly repaired , it will contribute to the amplification of viral infection-induced pathology.\n\u201d Adaptive immunity means we have the ability to make antibodies whenever we need to .\nThis allows the transformation of undifferentiated immune cells into the active B or T cell types that are ready to make antibodies ( B-cells ) or fight infection ( T-cells ) .\nLack of DNA repair is a problem because DNA changes can lead to cancer or mitochondrial conditions , which can include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trigger the body \u2019 s inflammation response , which leads to oxidative stress and more DNA damage .\nAdequate nutrients can help correct the oxidative stress chemical imbalance before damage occurs .\nBut once DNA damage occurs , it may be too late .\nIn contrast , data provides valuable details on the involvement of spike protein subunits in DNA damage repair , indicating that full\u2013length spike-based injections may inhibit the recombination of V ( D ) J in B cells , which is also consistent with a recent study that a full\u2013length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the RBD\u2013based jab .\nThis suggests that the use of antigenic epitopes of the spike as SARS\u2013CoV\u20132 injections might be safer and more efficacious than the full\u2013length spike .\n( Epitopes also known as antigenic determinants , are the immunologically active discrete sites on the antigen molecule that physically bind to antibodies , B-cell receptors , or T-cell receptors . )\n\u2026We identified one of the potentially important mechanisms of SARS\u2013CoV\u20132 suppression of the host adaptive immune machinery .\nFurthermore , our findings also imply a potential side effect of the full\u2013length spike-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a site on the exterior of a red blood cell , called an outfection , as opposed to an infection .\nSpike proteins are attaching to the exterior or bonding to the exterior of the erythrocyte , thus disturbing their surface appearance and probably their function .\nIs the truth unclear or is it simply hidden ?\nAt The Truth About Cancer event in Nashville , Del BigTree , who gave an epic presentation , revealed that in 2005 , doctors Drew Weissman and Katalin Karik\u00f3 discovered a way to protect foreign mRNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which would normally break down any mRNA found outside of a cell .\nWeissman and Kariko modified the gene sequence of the mRNA where the nucleoside uridine ( the motivation molecule ) was present .\nThe modification helps the foreign mRNA bypass part of the body \u2019 s first line of defense \u2014 the innate immune system .\nThis discovery was incorporated into the mRNA technology used in Covid injections , including the Pfizer mRNA code , so that the foreign mRNA could enter cells without being destroyed .\n( The pseudo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will dive into this in later parts of this primer ) .\nThis scientific milestone is the key to the advancement of mRNA injections in 2020 .\nAs Del explained , the simple removal of one letter of code from the terminal mRNA , and the substitution of a similar but different chemical called pseudouridine resulted in eliminating the KEY , alarm system of our innate immune system : the ablation of toll-like receptors 4 , 7 and 8 .\nThe body possesses two broad parts to its immune system : innate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go into action against foreign invaders , including foreign mRNA from a Covid injection .\nWhat are the consequences of switching off our important early warning system ?\nAre the mechanisms by which SARS\u2013CoV\u20132 suppresses adaptive immunity truly unclear ?\nOr are they just not being discussed ?\nThe S-proteins are the crown or corona of spike proteins that look like \u201c small mushrooms \u201d on the surface of the virus .\nThe spike proteins allow coronaviruses to invade human cells by attaching to the ACE2 receptor .\nCell receptors perform functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chemicals once activated , or may cause an action to occur on the interior of the cell .\nThese \u201c spear-like appendages \u201d attach to and completely surround the central core of the COVID virus , giving a \u201c porcupine-like appearance.\n\u201d Upon binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) receptors on the cell membranes of the target cells , enzymes are released that dissolves part of the cell membrane , allowing entry of the complete COVID virus into the cytoplasm of the cell \u2019 s interior .\nHere is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the virus hijacks for the purpose of replicating itself .\nTo reiterate , the spike glycoprotein ( S protein ) , allows virus entry with its ability to cleave or change its shape so it can fit into the ACE2 or other receptors , and it is a primary determinant of cell tropism and pathogenesis of human cells .\nAccording to many experts , it is the altered S-spike , not the virus , that is the concern .\nA paper titled \u201c Mechanisms of Coronavirus Cell Entry Mediated by the Viral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of standard coronaviruses and how these mechanisms are related to host tropism , which is the reason certain pathogens can only infect certain types of host species and cause illness .\nPhysicist-nuclear cardiologist-biologist-chemist-psychologist Dr. Richard Fleming , whom I first interviewed in August 2020 , also explains that the spike is the delivery system , but that real harm may also result from prion-like parts of the spike protein .\nThese prion-like areas of the gene sequence are unknown on any other coronavirus spike \u2013 they are only found on SARS-COV2 .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chimeric spike sequence that is being used in all of the CoV injections thus far .\nMisfolded proteins caused by prions are involved in Alzheimer \u2019 s dementia and autism and are a similar issue to prion diseases .\nMad cow disease has become the most recognized name for one type of prion condition .\nThe prion-like areas of the spike protein may cause a similar misfolding or tangling in other proteins .\nThe tangled protein causes an inflammatory reaction which can lead to fibrotic scarring and eventual cell death .\nPrions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause abnormal folding of specific normal cellular proteins in the brain .\nPrion protein damage , once it reaches the inflammatory scarring stage , causes tiny holes to form in brain tissue , making it appear sponge-like under a microscope .\nPrion disease is usually rapid and always fatal .\nViral replication causes the host cell to burst open , releasing viruses which then use part of the host cell membrane as their outer membrane .\nThe cellular fluid and other organelles leak into surrounding tissue and cause further inflammatory damage .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bio-weaponized virus or on the cells of injected people , would be the same .\nThe spike protein can cause some of the proteins to change shape , misfold , and lose their function .\nIn prion disease , the misfolded human protein can then cause other similar proteins to also misfold , which leads to an exponentially increasing problem .\nThe misfolded protein tangle and the clump can disrupt function further ; eventually scarring and cell death in the region leads to loss of function of the area .\nBrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty with cognitive skills , concentration , decision making , or speech and sense perception .\nPrion protein is transmissible .\nExosomes containing spike protein and possibly the mRNA gene sequence may also be exhaled or released in sweat or other body fluids by the recently CoV injected .\nBecause we are in unchartered territory , we do not really know about peak risk .\nWith that said , many , including myself have gotten ill after being in close proximity to people who have been freshly vaccinated and/or boosted .\nImmune-compromised people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a longer amount of time than people with a healthier immune system that is better able to detox the body .\nA frightening study published by the Human Microbiology Institute revealed the outer shell of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains \u201c prion-like regions \u201d that give the virus a 10-to20-fold higher affinity for ACE2 , to be exact .\nThe key region of the spike protein that studs SARS-CoV-2 \u2019 s outer surface is called \u201c receptor binding domain ( RBD ) .\n\u201d In 2017 , Johns Hopkins published \u201c The SPARS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a communications drill for a jab that could \u201c accidentally \u201d cause bovine spongiform encephalopathy aka \u201c mad cow \u201d prion disease .\nIt has rather conclusively been determined that the mRNA-produced S-spike protein is NOT QUITE THE SAME as in the SARS-CoV-2 virus .\nThe produced protein is similar but misshaped in 3D .\nIt is a chiral-mirrored or \u201c stereoisomer \u201d \u2013 a mirror image misfolded protein which can lead to similar problems as prion disease .\nAnd yet on January 21 , 2020 , a paper published by researchers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Immunity of the Shanghai Pasteur Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences mentioned that the sequence of a key part of the S protein of the virus is highly homologous to the SARS virus .\n( 6 ) Furthermore , there are studies that show that the mRNA COVID-19 jabs may progressively degenerate the brain from prion disease .\nHere is another Sept 2021 study that illustrates COVID-19 mRNA injection leads to CNS inflammation .\nAnd here are anecdotal reports from the NIH suggesting that the jabs may be associated with the brain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cardiac inflammation .\nThe CoV jabs hijack your body \u2019 s cells and cause them to churn out proteins modeled after the spike proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus .\nThus , it could be described as causing mRNA jab recipients to churn out prion-like toxins in their brains , as Dr. Sherri Tenpenny explains .\nIt doesn \u2019 t help the risk to health that prions tend to bond with heavy metals like lead , mercury , cadmium , and arsenic \u2013 all of which can be a risk for brain-damaging effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body to remove and tend to accumulate as we age .\nSome trace nutrients can also be damaging in excess quantities in the body or can cause a deficiency in other trace minerals .\nWe need minerals like manganese , chromium , and copper in very tiny amounts , but these may be contaminants found in water supplies and can be dangerous in excess .\nLead and arsenic are also common water contaminants .\nMeanwhile , it is unclear whether the Covid shots contain heavy metals like mercury or aluminum .\nConsider , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metals can impair taste and smell .\nNasal toxicity can impact the olfactory senses .\nI speak more about heavy metals later in this primer when covering the impact of nanoparticles in these jabs .\nIn Parts 1 and 2 of this primer , I have covered the genesis of the SARS-Cov-2 and explained why the S Protein in these injections is so damaging to the human body .\nStay tuned .\nThere are several more parts of this primer to comprehensively cover these injections .\nLike what you \u2019 re reading on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your friends .\nHelp

COVID jabs .\nThe article has direct quotes , and we are obligated to use the authors \u2019 original wording .\nMany concerned individuals are asking if they can recover their health after the jab

system , not only literally but in people \u2019 s minds as well .\nThere is an alternative to Rockefeller medicine and Sick Care and that is functional or integrative medicine , which strives to optimize your biology and deal with root causes in a holistic versus compartmentalized fashion .\nHow do these jabs and multiple kill-points cause damage ?\nWhat exactly are they doing in the body ?\nWhat poisonous ingredients are in these injections ?\nIf we do not understand the problem , how can we fully understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what is arguably an engineered bio-weapon .\nPlease consider that we are navigating uncharted territory , given that this experimental jab has never before been used in humans and is a genetic altering technology , not a vaccine .\nRecall that pharmaceutical companies have been working on a generalized coronavirus jab for about 20 years with no success \u2013 the shots never resulted in a safe or effective solution .\nEvery single animal trial conducted on animals for a coronavirus injection had the same outcome .\nChallenge studies showed that instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( eliminate ) the virus , the manipulated S protein allowed the virus to be more easily dragged into the cell .\nThis is called antibody-dependent enhancement because it makes the infection more dangerous .\nAs the mRNA jabs have been rolled out , the focus on spike proteins has been at the forefront .\nInjected people are producing massive amounts of spike protein , but what is a spike protein ?\nLet \u2019 s do a brief review of coronaviruses before we dive into that topic .\nThe current coronavirus illness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus similar to the one that caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) in 2002 .\nTherefore , the current virus is called SARS-CoV-2 , and the disease it causes is called COVID-19 .\n( In animals , the disease and the virus are both called SARS-CoV-2 ) .\nCoronaviruses are a group of viruses that belong to the family Coronaviridae , classified in four different genera , historically based on serological analysis and now on genetic studies : alpha- , beta- , gamma- , and delta .\nAlthough the coronavirus family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viruses gained particular notoriety when SARS became prevalent in 2002\u20132003 .\nInterest in this family of viruses grew in the aftermath of that epidemic , leading to the identification of many new coronaviruses within the viral family .\nThe NIH states : \u201c Coronaviruses ( CoVs ) , enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses , are characterized by club-like spikes that project from their surface , an unusually large RNA genome , and a unique replication strategy.\n\u201d All members of the coronavirus family have spike proteins , sharp bumps that protrude from the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play a very important role in how the virus infects its host because the spike attaches to surface proteins and enzymes , most commonly called angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE-2 ) receptors , located on the surfaces of cells and organs .\nOnce attached , the virus can easily enter the cell .\nThe NIH further stated : \u201c Before gaining importance for public health in 2003 , the diseases ( more accurately called an illness ) associated with coronaviruses were mainly of veterinary interest.\n\u201d \u2018 gain importance \u2019 or did the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wuhan Coronavirus gene , a team of Greek experts released a report on January 27 , 2020 , saying they studied and analyzed the genetic relationship of the Wuhan bat virus and the SARS-CoV2 virus , comparing them with other coronavirus sequences .\nThey found that the genes of the new Coronavirus had no close genetic relationship with other viruses in the sarbecvirus subgenus of Coronaviridae .\nHalf of the SARS-CoV2 gene sequence is different from any other coronavirus , and half of the chimeric spike protein sequence was included in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key to helping the virus invade host cells .\nModified spike can interact with ACE2 receptors to block the receptor \u2019 s normal function , and/or allow the virus to enter the cell .\nReceptors are surface proteins with different functions which may cause actions to occur within the cell or allow chemicals to enter the cell .\nIs this why the SARS-COV2 Virus was dubbed \u201c novel ?\n\u201d \u201c These research findings indicate that the Wuhan virus is a new type of Coronavirus and overthrew the author \u2019 s original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random natural mutations between different Coronaviruses .\nIn other words , the Wuhan virus did not evolve naturally , \u201d reported Great Game India .\nThis was discovered in part due to the envelope protein ( E protein ) ; its genes are adjacent to the spike-S-protein .\nSean Lin , a Ph.D. in microbiology and former director of the Virology Laboratory at the former Walter Reed Army Institute , noted that in the viral RNA replication process , these two adjacent genes replicate with similar intracellular factors and viral RNA polymerase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during this replication process is also similar .\nWith this in mind , Lin concluded there was no reason that during the natural viral replication process , the S protein would produce so many different mutations while the E protein remained largely unchanged .\n\u201c This is basically impossible to happen naturally because E protein has an indispensable effect on the virus morphology , assembly , budding , and virus pathogenicity of ?\n-type coronavirus .\nIf the virus changes the host , many cytokines will change and the E protein will necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synthesis and pathogenicity.\n\u201d There was a seemingly perfect consistency of E protein , which is difficult to explain with \u201c natural variation.\n\u201d Meanwhile , Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding , a senior epidemiologist at Harvard University , also commented on an anomaly found on January 28 ( the same day the DOJ announced ex Harvard Professor Charles Lieber \u2019 s arrest ) , citing the latest findings of the Greek scholars .\nHe stated , \u201c \u2026Some parts of the virus and its spike protein have never been seen in any other type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RNA viruses that includes cold and flu viruses , SARS-1 , MERS , and HIV .\nWith the opinion that the novel Coronavirus first identified in Wuhan , China , was created in a lab and with growing doubts over the official Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) position , Wuhan Institute of Virology and well-known virus expert of the institute , Shi Zhengli , stepped into public view .\nInterestingly , in 2010 , Zhengli \u2019 s team published a paper that examined the sensitivity of different types of bat ACE2 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , uses live SARS virus and HIV ( AIDS ) pseudovirus .\nIn the experiment , they also changed several key amino acids of bat ACE2 receptors to test its binding to the S protein and constructed the HIV pseudovirus HIV/BJ01-S with the SARS virus BJ01-S protein .\nShi Zhengli \u2019 s team realized the special relationship between the S protein and ACE2 receptor .\nBy January 11 , the entire genome sequence of the Wuhan virus was uploaded by China \u2019 s National Center for Disease Control and Prevention .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enormous amount in just 12 days ; somehow they were able to compare the Wuhan Virus and target the virus with the highest similarity from many coronaviruses in the virus bank , isolate the virus , upload the gene bank , and even write a paper .\n\u201c An unnoticeable detail is that Shi Zhengli submitted the registration information of the RaTG13 bat virus on January 27th , showing that the virus was isolated from the feces of Yunnan horseshoe bats ( chrysanthemum bat ) as early as July 24 , 2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important \u201c new horseshoe bat virus RaTG13 \u201d , which is likely to be the culprit causing the plague , was frozen in the Wuhan P4 laboratory for seven years , \u201d wrote Great Game India .\nMeanwhile , a group of Indian scientists concluded that the Wuhan Coronavirus had been engineered with AIDS-like insertions , meaning it is unlikely for a virus to have acquired such unique insertions naturally in a short duration of time .\nBut wait , there \u2019 s more !\nStay tuned for part 2 about the spike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading on The Tenpenny Report ?\nShare this

\u201c natural origin of COVID-19 theory \u201d down our throats ?\nAt that time , Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease ( NIAID ) , firmly took the reins of the pandemic , stepping up to the podium on a daily basis throughout 2020 and 2021 to assure us that his agency had it all under control .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the architect and the cover-up of the COVID-19 pandemic .\nAs the director of NIAID for nearly 40 years , an organization with an annual budget of $ 6 billion , he wields great power in the federal agency and across many branches

leaked from the Wuhan lab in China , only to later do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of natural origin .\nWho are they ?\nOn February 1 , 2020 , Fauci held a secret teleconference with four scientists : Kristian Anderson , Robert Garry , Michael Farzan , and Peter Daszak .\nThis emergency call occurred after the discovery that NIAID and the Wuhan Institute of Virology had funding ties .\nDuring that call , three of the four scientists said they were fairly certain the virus had been leaked from a lab .\nTwo days later , on February 3 , a paper was released entitled The Proximal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meaning , the virus had evolved on its own in nature .\nIn that paper , Kristian Andersen and Robert Garry proposed two scenarios to explain the origin of the SARS-CoV2 virus .\nBoth were natural origin theories , meaning a human needed to come into close contact with , or consume , an infected animal for genetic modification of the virus to occur .\nThis became known as \u2018 the wet market bat soup theory.\n\u2019 Since the February teleconference call , these scientists have collectively received over $ 50 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic funding over many previous years .\nFauci set up an $

peer institutions in the United States and 28 other countries .\nOf the 11 grants provided through CREID , three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funding .\nKirsten Andersen actually became known to many Americans when his January 2020 emails to Fauci were disclosed after the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests by newspaper outlets .\nIn those emails , Andersen urged Fauci to consider the lab leak theory , saying that his team had unanimously concluded that \u201c the genome is inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory .\n\u201d This means it wasn \u2019 t found in nature .\nHowever , Andersen gave himself an out by saying that he had to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so his opinion \u201c could change.\n\u201d And that \u2019 s exactly what happened !\nThe day before the Feb 1 teleconference , Andersen told Fauci privately that the virus appeared engineered .\nThe day after the telecon , Andersen appeared to have drastically switched opinions to favor the natural appearance opinion .\nDespite having absolutely no experience whatsoever in studying coronaviruses , Anderson served as lead author of the natural origin paper mentioned above .\nCoincidentally , Andersen also received $ 7.4 million in 2020 , a 60 % increase over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 2021 , Andersen \u2019 s total grant funding increased to $ 9 million .\nOn the teleconference , Robert Garry too was a lab leak theorist , actually stating openly on the call that he could see no plausible natural origin scenario from bat to human for COVID-19 .\nHe stated that a lab-origin theory was easily explained , and even debunked natural origin by explaining that all of the sequences of genetic mutations that would have had to take place for this transition to happen naturally were simply improbable : \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how this gets accomplished in nature.\n\u201d However , like Andersen , Garry had a change of heart , also becoming an author on the natural origin paper .\nCoincidentally , his grant funding increased from $ 5.7 to $ 7 million in 2020 and he also received $ 6.6 million in 2021 .\nGarry even made videos like this one purporting the natural origin theory .\nGarry later seemed to crack under the pressure , admitting that the teleconference leaders had pressured him not to discuss the lab origin theory .\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledgments for contributing significant discussions in the creation of the article .\nFarzan is a colleague of Andersen \u2019 s at Scripps University and is part of the university \u2019 s Global Health Initiative .\nIn the same emails acquired by FOIA , Farzan was noted as agreeing with Garry that the virus had properties that pointed to gain-of-function enhanced transmissibility , e.g .\na human-engineered virus .\nFarzan even told colleagues that he was confident in his lab-leak theory .\nFarzan knows of what he speaks .\nHe is a renowned immunologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( SARS ) virus receptor in 2005 .\nYet , just like the other two , Farzan did a rapid flip to the natural origin theory .\nWas it a coincidence that Farzan received nearly $ 20 million in Fauci funding in 2020 ( $ 9.9 million ) and 2021 ( $ 7.9 million ) ?\nHe received nearly an additional million dollars at the beginning of 2022 .\nThe funds appear to have come from NIAID but not from CREID .\nBy comparison , Farzad only received $ 3.8 million from NIAID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite an increase for any scientist of any caliber .\nSaving the best for last , Peter Daszak is Fauci \u2019 s fourth scientist and partner in crime .\nNotably , Daszak published a 2018 paper discussing the creation of a virus in a lab \u2013 one very similar to SARS-CoV-2 in fact .\nDaszak was actually in China when he participated in Fauci \u2019 s February 1 secret teleconference .\nAs a member of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) team , Daszak traveled as part of the team going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origins .\nDaszak emanated a \u201c nothing to see here \u201d narrative , and while in China , gave interviews to state-run media to back up his claim .\nHe even purported a theory that the virus was imported from Japan or Thailand into Wuhan .\nNow that \u2019 s a theory !\nDaszak was the mastermind behind silencing the engineered virus narrative .\nHow did he do it ?\nHe solicited 27 scientists to write a statement condemning the lab-leak theory and published it in the very influential medical journal The Lancet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his conflicts of interest to the journal , which included his personal involvement in Wuhan research .\nDaszak is president of the EcoHealth Alliance .\nThe organization has now been proven to have sent $ 600,000 in US taxpayer money to the Wuhan lab .\nDaszak \u2019 s role at EcoHealth involved repackaging government grants and sending them to research institutes , which included the Wuhan Institute of Virology .\nFor instance , Wuhan scientist Shi Zhengli received over $ 1.2 million in grant support from the US government .\nDaszak is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 , the US placed a moratorium on gain-of-function research , but several months prior , EcoHealth received a $ 3.7 million NIAID grant for ( you guessed it ) gain-of-function research .\nPart of the grant involved collecting bat samples to see which animal viruses could jump to humans when enhanced .\nDaszak \u2019 s grant was not initially halted under the moratorium but was later canceled by President Trump .\nAn additional Fauci grant to Daszak was remarkably timely , occurring right after Trump \u2019 s cancellation .\nBy 2018 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per year from a variety of federal agencies including the Department of Defense .\nLike the other teleconference scientists , Daszak also received money from Fauci \u2019 s CREID program ( $ 1.5 million in 2020 and again in 2021 ) , more than doubling his 2019 allocation of $ 660,000 .\nThe Agency for International Development ( USAID ) also awarded Daszak nearly $ 5 million in late 2021 .\nWhat prompted the scientists to push a narrative they once did not believe ?\nDid they find more evidence and change their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other way ?\nWas the lab leak theory really that far-fetched ?\nAfter all , we are all told there are only three labs in the world that conduct this kind of research : Chapel Hill , North Carolina ; Galveston , Texas ; and the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan , China .\nFurthermore , the Wuhan Institute of Virology was funded by the US to engineer a bat virus to infect human cells , and then that same virus breaks out in the same city that houses the level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the entire world .\nBut the virus emerged in a wet market .\nRight ?\nAlso interesting is that Dr. Fauci just happened to write a paper in 2012 stating that the benefits of gain-of-function research outweighed any risk of a lab-leaked pandemic .\nYet Fauci and his four compatriots have abandoned all plausible theory that the origins of COVID-19 were anything but natural .\nShare this

Robert Malone \u2019 s reference to the term on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast .\nDuring the interview , Malone spoke about the work of Mattias Desmet , a professor of clinical psychology at Ghent

this phenomenon to take shape .\nThose conditions are : social isolation , feeling like life has no meaning , free-floating anxiety , and aggression .\nAlthough we \u2019 re currently living through Mass Formation Psychosis , the groundwork for the problem was laid prior to the COVID-19 pandemic .\nFor nearly a decade , we \u2019 ve lived through social isolation due to increasing political

these conditions are present , the media can sweep in and construct a narrative that collectively controls the masses by playing on the very conditions that increase fear and anxiety .\nThe group being controlled feels a sense of accomplishment because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their anxiety and create a new social bond by fighting a perceived common enemy .\nThis experience leads to a sort of \u201c mental intoxication \u201d that hooks people .\nData and circumstances can change , but their viewpoint won \u2019 t change because it \u2019 s not about the information .\nIt \u2019 s about the

though they \u2019 re part of something .\nTheir lives finally have meaning .\nIf they let go of what they have come to believe , they will return to their previously meaningless life .\nThey won \u2019 t listen to facts that go against the narrative they cling to .\nThey \u2019 re just not interested in giving up their newfound sense of belonging , no matter how strongly their perception has been upended .\nGroupthink is especially powerful at the moment .\nIf you read any newspaper , I don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stakes are incredibly high .\nLeaders in the US and across the globe are pushing to relinquish all our civil liberties , using medical segregation , forced vaccination , and the installation of technology that will allow endless tracking of every aspect of our lives

trial .\nCharlie was initially accused of being a spy for the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) , but in the end , the courts found that the former Chair of Harvard University \u2019 s Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department was only guilty of six counts related to tax evasion .\nIndeed , many agencies including the DoD \u2019 s Defense Advanced Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profited from Lieber \u2019 s inventions .\nAttorney Frenchman added that Lieber was a \u201c casualty of [ a ] flawed initiative \u201d and that \u201c this injustice can not stand.\n\u201d The reference was to the \u2018 China Initiative \u2019 , which the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) launched in 2018 under Trump to combat what officials described as the Chinese government \u2019 s campaign to steal US trade

also engaged in recruiting US scientists , academics , engineers , and other experts to work in China .\nSo , Lieber was indeed working with China under the Thousand Talent Plan .\nThis program , launched in 2008 , incentivized individuals engaged in research and development in the United States to transmit the knowledge and research they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salaries , research funding , lab space , and other incentives .\nChina then used the American research and expertise it unfairly obtains for its own economic and military gain .\nLieber \u2019 s attorneys contend he was targeted and arrested

by \u201c simply thinking about moving his hands.\n\u201d The device recorded the monkey \u2019 s neuron activity while he interacted with the computer and then fed the data into a \u201c decoder

"Antibody-Dependent Enhancement ( ADE ) refers to a mechanism in which antibodies are unable to neutralize a virus but instead increase the ability to infect cells .\nADE can arise in several different ways but the best-known is dubbed the \u2018 Trojan Horse Pathway.\n\u2019 ADE occurs when a vaccine or past infection fails to shut down the pathogen upon re-exposure to the pathogen .\nInstead , the antibodies act as a gateway that allows the virus to gain entry and replicate in cells that are usually off-limits ( typically immune cells like macrophages ) .\nWhen this occurs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become more aggressive and cause more damage .\nADE is not a new concept ; it has been discussed since the late 1970s .\nFor viruses like dengue fever and HIV that pose a major threat to human health , the presence of ADE is considered to be a major obstacle to vaccine development .\nEven Anthony Fauci has admitted that this would not be the first time that a vaccine that initially looked good actually made people worse .\nIn fact , according to Dr. Robert Malone , the inventor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all attempts to develop corona virus-related vaccines .\n\u201c Antibody-dependent enhancement ( ADE ) of disease is a general concern for the development of vaccines and antibody therapies because the mechanisms that underlie antibody protection against any virus have a theoretical potential to amplify the infection or trigger harmful immunopathology , \u201d states a July 2020 article in Nature titled \u201c A perspective on potential antibody-dependent enhancement of SARS-CoV-2.\n\u201d By the way , Big Harma cohorts renamed ADE \u201c Vaccine Enhanced Disease.\n\u201d \u201c ADE not only promotes the virus to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering the target cell , but it also affects the signal transmission in the target cell , \u201d according to the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) .\nIn effect , this means that the Covid-19 injections cause a vaccinated person \u2019 s immune system to go into overdrive when they come into contact with the virus , causing harm to the person and worsening disease .\nThere is a growing concern for individuals who have received a COVID shot and the pathology ( illness ) that will develop when these individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SARS-CoV-2 virus .\nBecause SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses have approximately 78-85 % genetic overlap , it is presumed a reaction would be similar in both ) .\n\u201c The combination of high viral replication rates in individuals who also produce suboptimal , non-neutralizing antibodies creates the exact environment in which resistant viruses are likely to emerge and spread , \u201d according to a study in medRxiv .\nAnd now official data released by the UK government in early April 2020 show that the vaccinated are indeed suffering ADE .\n\u201c The fully vaccinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to be infected with Covid-19 , two times more likely to be hospitalised with Covid-19 , and three times more likely to die of Covid-19 than unvaccinated individuals , \u201d according to the Daily Expose .\nIn fact , this is a pandemic of the vaccinated .\nEven worse \u2013 Pfizer and the FDA knew that the mRNA Covid-19 injections would do this .\nInstead , they claimed that \u201c no new safety issues have been raised \u201d .\nPhase three clinical trials are designed to uncover frequent or severe side effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is approved for use .\nHere is a small little detail \u2013 none of the Covid-19 injections have completed phase three clinical trials .\nThe Pfizer phase three trial is not due to complete until February 2024 , after previously being estimated to complete in April 2023 .\nThe antibody response to mRNA shots is higher than titers seen in convalescent ( recovering ) individuals .\nThis results in a high ratio of non-neutralizing antibodies .\nNeutralizing antibodies are the goal of any vaccine because they help prevent infection or symptoms from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm .\nIn the case of the CoV jabs , which is more of a gene therapy experiment , neutralizing antibodies are also signaling immune cells to kill the human cells that contain the surface spike protein as if the human cells are a foreign virus .\nThis reaction is similar to an autoimmune response or disease , except that many different types of cells throughout the body may all be involved instead of just specific autoimmune antibodies against thyroid tissue and gluten , for example ( molecular mimicry \u2013 similar chemical shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as \u2018 self \u2019 , immune cells will ignore the virus , allowing the infection to grow freely , which means the disease process is \u2018 enhanced \u2019 .\nThis means that the infection will be much worse than if there hadn \u2019 t been vaccine-inducing non-neutralizing antibodies .\nNon-neutralizing antibodies are certainly not the goal of vaccines , and animal mRNA vaccine research found this was a big problem .\n\u201c These types of \u2018 vaccines \u2019 ; this modified RNA ; they have tried them in the past on animals with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madej .\nShe says that at first they expressed a robust response but then when they came into contact with the virus , the body attacked it \u2019 s own self.\n\u201d Listen here to Dr. Madej explain ADE to Mike Adams .\nEventually , all the animals died once exposed to the wild-type virus .\nAll jabbed test animals had autoimmune injuries to their lungs after a re-exposure .\nIn an NIH study , Lung tissue of vaccinated macaques monkeys revealed acute diffuse alveolar ( ADA ) injury with various degrees of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wound healing was blocked by anti-S-IgG antibodies , resulting in prolonged macrophage activity and promotion of severe lung injury .\nLung tissue in unvaccinated macaques revealed only minor to moderate inflammation .\nAlveolar monocytes/macrophages assume a wound-healing function as early as two days after the onset of infection in macaques who were unvaccinated .\nIf the non-neutralizing antibodies encounter a SARS-CoV2 virus , any variant with a closely matching spike protein will bind with the spike .\nPeople with minimal symptoms after the jabs may have been one of the lucky ones to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batches .\nADE reactions generally lead to the death of the research animal .\nThere is limited information regarding humans , as adverse vaccine reactions tend to be called other things in lieu of performing autopsies .\nA nasal infection leading to lung infection would show more damage in the upper area of the lungs .\nAn ADE infection would likely create more damage throughout the lungs and body .\nDid virus hunters who suffer from Vaccine Mania Vitriol Disorder ( my take on \u2018 Vaccine Hesitancy \u2019 ) finally unleash a bioweapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sloppy fashion ?\nThey had already published Agenda 21 in 1993 , followed by Agenda 2030 and Rockefeller \u2019 s Lockstep , both a depopulation agenda and a transhumanist agenda .\nThese vaccines represent large worldwide experiments on human beings .\nThis is the biggest Nuremberg Code violation perpetrated in human history .\nConsider that in June 2020 , a symposium weighed the pros and cons of bypassing animal trials \u2018 in the face of an emergency.\n\u2019 \u201c Although this looks promising for fast-tracking vaccine development , there is division among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Phase I clinical trials .\nIn addition , agencies like PETA are against using animals for research purposes .\nThe question remains : Can vaccine research do without an animal model ?\n\u201d NEW ABOVE THIS POINT Where are the non-profit organizations that stand against using humans for research purposes ?\nAnd by the way , PETA actually kills animals .\nAre we the lab rats \u2014 especially black lives , which too often have been experimented on in the past ?\nDo they matter most to those in power because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they vaccine-hesitant because they remember the Tuskegee experiment which spanned four decades ?\nThe SARS vaccine was ready in record time , but it didn \u2019 t make it through animal trials because it killed all the test animals .\nThe animals created antibodies , but when they were reinfected , the immune system didn \u2019 t attack ( non-neutralizing antibodies . )\nA cash-hungry biotech company is always optimistic though \u2013 everything would be fine .\nAfter all , they were creating a bioweapon arguably intended to be a slow kill .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight to twelve years .\nYet somehow in 2020 , Big Pharma was able to \u2018 warp speed \u2019 the creation of several vaccines ?\nAlso , keep in mind that the \u2018 novel \u2019 coronavirus has not been photographed , isolated , or purified .\nInstead , we are left with a virtual sequence based on a mishmash of coronaviruses .\nThe SARS-CoV2 \u2018 virus \u2019 represents a group of viruses .\nRNA viruses mutate very readily to suit different environments .\nOn average , they are more heat tolerant in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid-tolerant in the digestive tract .\n\u201c The whole alternative point about there being \u201c no virus \u201d because of Koch \u2019 s Postulates \u2013 is simply wrong regarding RNA type viruses .\nRNA viruses are a group of variants rather than all being genetically the same organism like a malaria parasite is always a malaria parasite in some stage of growth .\nAnd there is definitely a chimeric spike protein that was patented in 2018 , in the US by Ralph Baric out of the University of North Carolina .\nThe chimeric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer sequenced bioweapon rather than natural mutations .\nAll of the CoV injections use the same modified version of that , which NIH gave them \u2013 and they all used it .\nThe bat coronavirus used as a carrier for the chimeric spike protein , in itself , is not that big a problem deal to a person of reasonable health , compared to anything designed to include the chimeric spike , because is toxic to us in many ways.\n\u201d \u2013 Jennifer Depew , RD , Registered Dietitian .\nReferences \u2013 Spike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWith that said , there are various protocols and natural remedies to detox and attempt to restore metabolic and mitochondrial function .\nArguably , these are things you should have been doing all along to keep your body functioning properly .\nThe argument would be that to stay in normal health takes some care , but an immune challenge , whether an infection or manmade injection , causes a sudden and huge need for extra nutrients .\nNatural immunity does work \u2013 when you provide the tools that our cells and mitochondria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Is anything out there that can re-repair your genetic code or DNA damage ?\nThe answer : Epigenetic changes can change back when methyl donor vitamins are available ( methyl or hydroxy B12 , folate , and choline ) .\nPhytonutrients may also help with DNA damage and protect against cancerous changes .\n\u201c Recently , we have shown that dietary phytochemicals such as quercetin , rutin , rosmarinic acid , luteolin , and others not only protect DNA damage but also stimulate DNA repair in liver and colon cell lines ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et al.\n, 2008 ; Ramos et al.\n, 2010b ; Ramos et al.\n, 2010a ) .\nThese effects may contribute to their anti-carcinogenic effects \u201d .\nWe have also included treatments useful for those who experience getting \u201c spiked , \u201d humans who were passively exposed to spike exosomes via those injected .\n\u201c Vaccinated \u201d people can shed spike protein and potentially the mRNA to create it , in small membrane packets called exosomes , which are similar to pheromones .\nWhen we are \u2018 love struck \u2019 , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough genetic match were breathed in from a person who would potentially be a good genetic match for any future babies .\nThe exosome or pheromone will only open for another cell that has a matching surface protein marker , and then the mRNA enclosed within the membrane packet will be released into the recipient cell which will start producing the protein encoded by the mRNA sequence .\nDepending on what it was , the cell may produce \u2018 love struck \u2019 chemicals or spike protein or whatever other protein was encoded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for

about my thoughts on the material presented .\nSo , a response is in order .\nWhile this is not the fruit of my research , Bryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researcher .\nThe information he presented raises some important questions that demand further investigation .\nI do believe he could have made his case tighter and his arguments stronger if he had his presentation reviewed by an advisory board of sorts , consisting of other doctors and scientists , prior to its release .\nNonetheless , what he presented was a giant club and he used it to hammer home the reality of just how uncertain we really are regarding the ingredients of these untested and unapproved shots .\nWhether or not snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocking truth has come to light : just how pervasive the use of snake venom is within pharmaceuticals .\nFrom some cursory research I have done , snake venom has been used medicinally and for healing ceremonies for many , many years .\nFor example , the venom of the Brazilian pit viper is used to make drugs to treat hypertension .\nVenom extracted from the rattlesnake and the saw-scaled viper has been used to treat heart conditions such as angina .\nBecause hemotoxins have anti-clotting properties , hemotoxins extracted from venom have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high blood pressure , heart attacks , and blood disorders .\nSimilarly , extracted neurotoxins have been used in drugs to treat strokes and brain-related diseases such as Alzheimer \u2019 s disease .\nOther conditions that may be treated using snake venom include cancer and even erectile dysfunction , for which cobra venom is renowned .\nSource .\nMike Adams released a document that has all of the studies used by Dr. Ardis in his interview .\nFor those who are interested , you can find it here .\nWhether or not his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts have helped to wake up the fearful masses .\nHe has further educated those who \u201c still believe \u201d the fear-based messages spewed worldwide every day by the Propaganda Machine .\nWith the release of his information , millions more have come face-to-face with the depth of evil these satanic Luciferians are willing to go to eliminate humans and destroy humanity .\nWhile this text apparently originated in a 1991 book , \u201c Conspirator \u2019 s Hierarchy : The Story of The Committee of 300\u2032 by Dr. John Coleman , it certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Kissinger .\nIn the book , The Final Days , Kissinger was quoted as saying , \u201c The elderly are useless eaters.\n\u201d The Georgia Guidestones are real and their population \u2013 or should I say , depopulation \u2013 agenda has been known and followed for years .\nEven though Klaus Schwab may not have actually written this paragraph in his book , if you \u2019 ve been following anything put out by the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) over the last few years , he certainly could have used similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great Reset .\nThose with eyes to see and ears to hear ( Proverbs 20:12 ) are being readied for a spiritual battle of epic magnitude .\nDuring the last two years , we have only been able to chip away at the \u201c spell \u201d cast over the fearful sheep .\nNow that their brains have exploded with the \u2018 snake venom \u2019 information , finally , humanity is beginning to question EVERYTHING COVID , My thoughts are , \u201c Bring it on !\n\u201d It \u2019 s time to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt \u2019 s time to expose every evil deed they have done and every evil deed they still intend to do .\nRemember this quote from the movie , \u201c Law Abiding Citizen \u201d ?\nLike the dawn of a new day , the satanic luciferins are being exposed more at every turn .\nThey will soon be scorched by the full heat and intensity of the sun of justice .\nOr more accurately , they will be scorched for all eternity by the full glory of the Living Son of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my talks or presentations since January of this year , you know I have been literally preaching that the only solution to all of this is a spiritual one .\n\u201c You can not find a physical solution to a spiritual problem.\n\u201d The answer will only be found in Jesus Christ .\nSpecifically , choosing to accept the Gospel and actually walking with Jesus , in an intimate and personal relationship , not just giving lip service to believing in some generic , New-Agey \u201c God \u201d \u2013 or however you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve been putting out the following message and creating educational programs for more than 20 years : All vaccines are , and always HAVE been bioweapons , poisoning children from birth , and now , even in utero .\n\u2022 I pray the message of unknown and known ingredients will trickle down to reflect an understanding of the harm caused by EVERY vaccine that has EVER been created .\n\u2022 I pray what is happening now is part of God \u2019 s Great Awakening .\n\u2022 I pray the starkness of the message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blow up the entire medical system .\nIt \u2019 s completely broken .\nDr. Ardis \u2019 message has been one more grenade used to expose the tsunami of ignorance practiced by well-meaning but ignorant doctors .\nWithin this ever-widening gap of what was\u2026 and what needs to be\u2026 I see a New Approach to health and financial stability forming , like the phoenix rising from the ashes .\nQuite frankly , going forward , I have neither time nor interest in proving or disproving the snake venom issue other than to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the premise that \u201c it \u2019 s in the water.\n\u201d That said , thank you , Dr. Bryan Ardis , for exploding one more layer of their spell .\nFull steam ahead .\nMay God bless and protect you .\nLike what you \u2019 re reading on TheTenpennyReport.com ?\nShare this article with your friends .\nHelp

Moakley Courthouse in Boston to request an acquittal or a new trial .\n( Documents are sealed until mid-July unless purchased directly from the courts ) .\nInitially , in January 2020 , Lieber was accused of espionage .\nAfter nearly a two-year wait , a December 2021 trial commenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal jury found Lieber guilty of two counts of lying to federal officials about his involvement with the China-sponsored Thousand Talents Program ( TTP ) .\nLieber was also charged with four tax-related offenses , such as failing to file reports about a foreign bank account in China .\nThis prediction appeared on April 18 , 2020 , in an Aim4Truth article , detailing Papa Lieber \u2019 s ties to RCA and David Sarnoff .\nIndeed , the DOJ presser on January 28 , 2020 , made it seem as though the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fizzled out , Lieber disappeared from the narrative , and the charges were diluted .\nThe current narrative paints Charlie as the \u201c victim , \u201d a casualty of a \u201c misguided China Initiative.\n\u201d \u201c \u2026 We think the Court should rectify what is a manifest injustice , \u201d Lieber attorney Marc L. Mukasey told 91-year-old Judge Rya W. Zobel .\nFor background , the Department of Justice \u2019 s China Initiative was launched under the Trump administration in 2018 to target those suspected of \u201c trade secret theft \u201d and \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the program is being billed as a \u201c controversial colossal blunder \u201d that \u201c lost its focus.\n\u201d Allegedly , the program had \u201c gone off the rails \u201d with respect to prosecutorial misconduct and a disproportionate focus on individuals of Chinese heritage .\nThis is ironic , given the DOJ just arrested five individuals who were stalking , harassing , and spying on Chinese nationals on behalf of the PRC Secret Police .\nBasically , the Chinese government was spying on their own people in the United States .\nNonetheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an embarrassment .\n\u201c It has left the DOJ with egg on their faces\u2026 And that \u2019 s why right after our trial\u2026 the Department of Justice shut down the China Initiative.\n\u201d Lieber \u2019 s attorneys added that it was this erroneous China Initiative that led to his being questioned by the Department of Defense and by Harvard officials on behalf of the National Institutes of Health .\nResearching on this supposed failed China Initiative , I learned that the government of the United States had 404 \u2019 d the page .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the website content .\nYou can now only find it in the DOJ archives .\nIn addition to a faulty program , his attorneys continue to maintain Lieber \u2019 s innocence and stated that the allegations against him were both vague and without merit .\n\u201c What was he guilty of ?\nThat he was a spy ?\nNo .\nThat he stole trade secrets ?\nNo .\nThat he stole intellectual property ?\nNo .\nThat he was loyal to China ?\nNo .\nThat he worked for China ?\nNo .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ would argue Lieber is guilty of ushering in an anti-God transhumanist agenda with nanotech inventions that include virus-sized transistors , brain-machine interfaces , and cyborg heart tissue .\nAlas , fusing man with a machine is not illegal .\nGo here to learn more about his frightening 66-plus patents .\nDuring the recent hearing , his attorneys added that the accusations always were very unclear , both to the questioners and \u201c certainly to Professor Lieber.\n\u201d \u201c Was it grant fraud , was it espionage , was it some kind of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict of interest rules at Harvard ?\nAnd shamefully , Harvard never even provided a lawyer to help .\nInstead , they left Professor Lieber for the slaughter.\n\u201d But had they really ?\nWas Lieber a patsy or was Harvard simply putting on a show for appearances , knowing full well that he was very much a prized asset ?\nIncidentally , Lieber \u2019 s CV is loaded with awards and accolades , with Thomson Reuters identifying him as the top chemist in the entire world .\nIn a March 2021 letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieber \u2019 s Harvard colleagues , objected to the charges brought against him .\nThey argued the prosecution inflicted damage to academic freedom and scholarly collaboration .\nIn truth , Harvard knew Lieber was working with the Wuhan University of Technology ( WUT ) .\nThey had a joint Nano Key Lab and he was the director as well as the \u2018 strategic scientist \u2019 for WUT .\nHarvard profited from his pioneering nanotech .\nAs did the DOD , DARPA , NIH , and China .\nLieber has 11 Chinese patents .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Award , and a WUT employee thanked him for his \u201c irreplaceable contribution to China.\n\u201d Nonetheless , during the approximate ten minutes of opening statements , his attorney maintained that the only remaining allegation was that Lieber was selected as a member of the TTP .\n\u201c Which , even if it \u2019 s true , is not illegal , even if you ask the government.\n\u201d Two years and gobs of gaslighting later , you would never suspect that the trial evidence overwhelmingly illustrated that Lieber knowingly and willfully lied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had participated in the Thousands Talents Program ( TTP ) .\nThe TTP is a Chinese government recruitment scheme to attract foreign scientists , and that effort would provide $ 1.5m in funding for a new lab at WUT .\nMr. Lieber himself received up to $ 50,000 a month , some of which were deposited in a Chinese bank account , along with compensation for living expenses .\n\u201c He lied to Harvard .\nThat \u2019 s not a crime .\nSorry .\nIt \u2019 s not a crime to lie to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it \u2019 s not a crime , \u201d his attorney stated .\nHow about the evidence illustrating that Professor Lieber knew that the lie , that false statement , would be transmitted by Harvard to NIH in the letter that was ultimately sent ?\nGovernment attorney Donald Lockhart reminded the courts that this was not a grant fraud prosecution .\nLieber lied to two different federal agencies concerning his participation with the Chinese Communist Party \u2019 s TTP .\nHe concealed both a substantial income from that same program in two separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank account , which held roughly half of his salary under the TTP .\nLockhart reminded the courts that Lieber himself in his videotaped confession said that \u201c the very essence of the Thousand Talents Program is that you \u2019 re paid a salary by China and that China uses this program to seduce people.\n\u201d In the 2020 FBI interview , parts of which jurors saw on the fourth day of the trial , Lieber admitted to the agents conducting the interrogation that he did not declare payments he received in $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also told the agents he \u201c wasn \u2019 t completely transparent by any stretch of the imagination \u201d when speaking to Department of Defense investigators two years earlier in 2018 .\nLieber admitted to literally being given cash in paper bags which he brought back into the United States .\n\u201c Professor Lieber , \u201d added Lockhart , \u201c caused Harvard University to tell NIH that he was not and had never been a participant in the Thousand Talents Program , when , in fact , he had signed a three-year contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added Lockhart , was that Lieber had the luxury of reviewing the draft letter that Harvard wrote to NIH .\n\u201c He ha [ d ] a final chance to correct this statement .\nHe doesn \u2019 t .\nYou look at the trial evidence .\nHe did a redline copy of this letter , and he left that damning lie statement intact.\n\u201d In essence , Lieber \u2019 s attorneys seemed to be grasping for straws , focusing on frivolities to free their client .\nFor example , they reiterated their previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieber failed to properly inform him of his Miranda rights .\nIn the new trial , his defense requested to exclude his interrogation footage from the evidence .\nThe CCP under Xi Jinping released its 14th Five-year plan with special emphasis being laid on the \u2018 1000 Talents Plan \u2019 .\nThe CCP is constantly trying to access technological advancements and innovations taking place in the USA on USA taxpayers \u2019 money .\nThe stolen technological know-how is being essentially used by Beijing for military and economic gains under Xi Jinping \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lieber would face up to 26 years in prison and $ 1.2m in fines .\nBut instead of being sentenced , Judge Zobel will now consider the defense \u2019 s

of February 2022 , about 75 percent of kids aged 0 to 11 had natural immunity .\nGoing into the summer months , that number is likely much closer to 100 percent .\nThese two measures are likely to pass the FDA with flying colors , particularly given that the CDC \u2019 s Advisory Committee on Immunization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age 5 and older is eligible for a Pfizer COVID-19 booster : The CDC is also now recommending a fourth shot \u2013 a second booster \u2013 for immunocompromised children over age 12 and adults over age 50 .\nWhat about the injuries ?\nIt is perplexing and extremely troubling that the CDC and FDA are still approving these pseudo-vaccines , despite more and more published peer-reviewed literature saying that immunity rapidly fades with each additional COVID shot .\nThe latest example is a study published May 13 , 2022 , by the JAMA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declining levels of neutralizing antibodies after the second and third Pfizer dose .\nNeutralizing antibodies target the virus and stop it from replicating , but the study shows that antibody levels started dropping as early as three weeks after the booster .\nIn short , repeated boosting does not work , and more and more doctors like senior scholar Dr. Amesh Adalja from Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security are saying repeated boosting is not a viable strategy .\nForbes first reported the JAMA Network Open article findings and also reported that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 such as Maine , Vermont , and Rhode Island with a more than 75 % injection rate \u2013 there is a much higher occurrence of Omicron and other illnesses .\nThe Moderna and Pfizer data are even more troubling for children .\nSeveral Nordic countries , including Finland , Sweden , Denmark , and Norway , suspended the use of Moderna \u2019 s jab in teenagers because of the myocarditis risk , and Finland and Sweden forbid it in men under age 30 .\nThe Pfizer mRNA shot has been shown to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company has had two failed clinical trials , reported in their own press releases , for kids aged 6 months to four years in December 2021 and then again in February 2022 .\nThe FDA delayed action in this age group after the second failed trial .\nCritically Thinking Question # 4 : Why is the FDA considering this when there are two failed clinical trials ?\nThe truth is that the Pfizer jab is not effective after only ONE month for children aged 5 to 11 , as shown by the NY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks , the effectiveness was a negative ( -41 ) percent , meaning that jabbed children were more likely to catch COVID than the unjabbed .\nFurther , the Pfizer jab has demonstrated unprecedented and catastrophic harm to children : Nearly 50,000 VAERS reports on adverse events in children which include numerous fatality reports .\nKeep in mind that VAERS is likely unreported by a factor of 41 to 100 % .\nBut that \u2019 s not all .\nThe FDA will likely end the month of June with its Future Framework for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the history of public health : They are going to use the flu strain selection process as a benchmark and apply it to future COVID shots .\nKeep in mind that the approach does not work well with the flu , given that 2021 data shows the flu shot formulation was only 16 percent effective .\nBut if the FDA passes this , we will have randomly assigned and many Covid-19 shots in perpetuity .\nCritically Thinking Question # 5 : Was this the plan all along ?\nYes , this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article entitled \u201c Dear Friends , Sorry to Announce a Genocide \u201c , Dr. Naomi Wolf reveals her horrific discovery of the evil genocide plans surfacing from the Pfizer document releases .\n( Her article is long but is a MUST READ . )\nThe FDA knows and Pfizer has known since December 2020 that the mRNA \u201c technology \u201d does not work as they claim .\nThis is known as \u201c vaccine failure \u201d in the industry , e.g .\nthe universally accepted concept of occurrence of a

umbrella of an Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) .\nNo one publically discussed the risk of heart damage until August 2021 , and at that point , it was too late .\nThousands upon thousands of teens had already received the jab .\nPediatric Cardiologist , Kirk Mihoan MD , stated in a January 5 , 2022 interview : Pfizer also knew that children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without being jabbed by skin contact , inhalation , or lactation , so it \u2019 s untold how many babies and children were exposed by contact with their jabbed parents .\nAthletic teens are collapsing on playing fields around the world .\nAs of June 1 , 2022 , 1090 top athletes around the world had had cardiac arrests ; 715 have died .\nWhy has this not gotten the attention of everyone in the world ?\nPfizer knew this too because their own Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) filings show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fainting so violently that you may hurt yourself .\nIt was important enough to disclose to the SEC for financial reasons , but not important enough to share with parents who needed the information .\nThe FDA \u2019 s June lineup for approvals is both sickening and terrifying .\nBy the end of this month , these death

food systems and beyond .\nCertainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of poisons in our environment , right ?\nWrong .\n\u201c I am an investigative journalist , and functional medicine coach , best known for directing the documentary film Vanishing of the Bees .\nI am outlining a theory/writing a piece about the burgeoning rate of transgenders .\nI suspect this has to do with the crazy amounts of estrogen mimickers , endocrine disruptors , soy , toxin synergy , etc .\nin our environment .\nI am looking for EXPERTS when it comes to these toxins .\nThis is NOT a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you study the food supply and you realize \u2018 food is thy medicine \u2019 and that we are living in an increasingly toxic world where frogs are born as hermaphrodites , then yes it \u2019 s VERY possible that similar effects are happening to humans.\n\u201d According to ComFood , I had committed a thought crime .\nAnd even though \u201c Cancel Culture \u201d wasn \u2019 t yet a thing , I was shamed and told I was being a \u201c brackish bigot.\n\u201d \u201c In asking to get connected to \u2018 experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are basically asking the listserv to support you in reducing people \u2019 s lived experience and identity to a question of \u2018 were they poisoned into being trans ?\n\u2019 which is profoundly offensive.\n\u201d \u201c As food professionals , I assure you we are aware of the way that our environment impacts us , and even more so how our fellow humans impact each other .\nI would urge that before you begin this effort , you deeply interrogate your reasoning behind wanting to draw the larger trans and gender expansive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are trying to claim that environmental conditions can cause a physically \u2018 incorrect \u2019 expression of gender identity ( and therefore , that the \u2018 right \u2019 environmental conditions can also cause the \u2018 correct \u2019 expression of gender identity ) , which is a dangerous assertion for many folks in the LGBTQIA+ community.\n\u201d \u201c Unfortunately , this theory/report comes across as misinformed about trans experiences .\nI urge you to learn more about the trans and non-binary community near you , or connected to your medical field first .\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you \u2019 d like to talk about trans health and medical needs .\nI suggest checking out your nearest LGBTQ health center to see what resources and investigative journalism would positively support and benefit the trans community.\n\u201d Like many other things , I was on the front lines of what was to come .\nAnd now that I think about it , it \u2019 s kind of ironic that the narrator of my bee film , Ellen Page , has since surgically removed her small breasts and transitioned into Elliot .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ComFood mailing list who encouraged me , they did so privately .\nNeedless to say , I never reached out to ComFood again or followed through on my story idea .\nBut despite the scorn , I maintained my assertion .\nA year later , in 2019 , Psychology Today ran an article titled \u201c Gender Fluidity and Hormone Disruptors , \u201d outlining how certain chemicals increase gender dysphoria .\nBecause they do .\nThe article actually states , \u201c Whatever one \u2019 s opinions about such matters , it is short-sighted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d I was reminded recently of this four-year-old email exchange while listening to Matt Walsh \u2019 s commentary on a new-fangled branch of medicine dubbed \u201c Gender-Affirming Care.\n\u201d Walsh said , \u201c There are some major screwups on the heavenly assembly line , and somehow it \u2019 s happening a lot more over at the factory.\n\u201d Walsh was being sarcastic .\nWatch : Matt Walsh Reacts To Fox News Trans Affirming Today , I would add to my toxin-induced transgender theory the poisoned nature of a sick society that has birthed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be worth $ 1.6 billion , by 2026 .\nConsider it was a $ 316 million market in 2019 .\nIn other words , Big Ag is producing Big Toxins , including atrazine , phthalates , and a slew of xenoestrogens that are compounding gender dysphoria .\nNext , factor in the twisted physicians , courtesy of a Rockefeller medicine mindset , who dole out puberty blockers/ chemical castration drugs , and synthetic hormones .\nThe government and propaganda media refer to these meds as \u201c putting a pause on puberty \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and space needed to explore and settle on their gender identity.\n\u201d While doctors and patients have been roasted and reprimanded for \u2018 off-label \u2019 use of hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) or ivermectin for COVID-19 , gender specialists dole out these drugs by the handful , even though they have NOT been approved by the FDA .\nThese hormones , which can cause irreversible changes including chronic acne and even infertility , are being given to kids as young as 13 .\nThere are very few studies on what puberty blockers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s NIAID spent $ 478,188 of taxpayer money to turn monkeys transgender .\nFor real .\nResearchers stated they had injected male monkeys with female hormones in order to understand why transgender women reportedly experience higher rates of HIV .\nBut what else did they glean ?\nScientists planned to evaluate how the injected hormones altered the male monkey \u2019 s immune systems to determine if feminizing hormones had an adverse effect on the strength of immune systems .\nYet no conclusions are available .\nIn addition to castration and gender-changing drugs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedures that \u2018 snip and tuck \u2019 , turning private body parts into commodities .\nSome procedures include facial feminization surgery , breast removal/augmentation , vaginoplasty , phalloplasty , phallectomy , orchiectomy , and hysterectomy .\nJust like they created a booming industry out of the Cult Of Corona , consider all the \u201c gender clinics \u201d , drugs , implants , and more that are needed to change the appearance and function of God-given body parts and to snuff out biological reality .\nIn fact , favorable government policies toward \u201c gender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c driving the industry demand , \u201d according to the global market research and management consulting company , Global Market Insights .\nUnder The Affordable Care Act , a.k.a Obamacare , health insurance is provided to transgender and gender non-conforming people for sex reassignment surgeries and other \u201c technological advancements \u201d .\nSo , is it safe to say that the government is supporting the transitioning humanity ?\nThe current trend is helping to normalize the notion that souls can find themselves in the wrong body is skyrocketing at a rate like never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an option for detoxing our environment and our body before taking on these extreme medical procedures ?\nThe perception is that the body must be thoroughly altered to match the mind \u2019 s perception of how it ought to be .\nMany critics argue that there is a concerted push to muddle the sexes .\nThis ideology and practice of disembodiment is being driven across medical , legal , cultural , and educational institutions .\nFor instance , an excellent piece , written by reporter Jennifer Bilek , outlines how the billionaire Pritzker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normalizing transgenderism or what she calls \u201c Synthetic Sex Identities ( SSI ) .\n\u201d In 2013 , around the time gender ideology entered the mainstream American culture , Jennifer Pritzker announced a transition to womanhood .\nAt its core , the embrace of transgenderism is not simply about societal acceptance and inclusion of people with alternative views or lifestyles , but a giant ideological redefinition of what it means to be human

"content": "By John Jones , PhD , JD .\nGuest Contributor to the Tenpenny Report The recent court opinion Dobbs vs Jackson Women \u2019 s Health should terrify all who espouse liberty .\nThough the opinion rails against legal arguments offered in Roe v Wade ( 1973 ) and Casey v Planned Parenthood ( 1992 ) , if we dig a bit , we see much more .\nThe broader theme of the Dobbs \u2019 opinion explains why and how police power is reserved to the States , and that each State legislature can regulate individual behavior \u2013 with near plenipotentiary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public health .\nDobbs , Alito and five other justices did not outlaw abortion .\nInstead , they made a declaration about any state-level statue which criminalizes abortion : such a law does not violate : ( i ) any individual liberty ; or ( ii ) any individual right in the Constitution .\nThese exact same arguments can be used to uphold criminal laws for refusal to be vaccinated , masked , or quarantined .\nIn American law , there is no set definition for words and phrases like liberty , rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how they use these words , judges , branded as liberal or conservative , nearly always favor the State .\nIn the 1930s , the Supreme Court supported a minimum wage law favored by Democratic president Roosevelt ( West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish in 1937 ) , However , these supposedly liberal justices also punished a man for growing his own food ( Wickard v. Filburn 1947 ) . )\nIn 1944 , these same liberal justices , ruled that American citizens could be imprisoned \u2013 indefinitely \u2013 due to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later , in 2018 , when four so-called conservative justices formed part of a majority that overturned the case ( Korematsu v. United States , 323 U.S. 214 ) .\nSince October 2001 , men and boys from all over the world \u2013 even America \u2013 have been kidnapped , sold for bounties , and tortured .\nSome are still imprisoned \u2013 in Guantanamo or other locations .\nDespite being tortured and held without charge , federal court justices , including many current members of the US Supreme Court , have ruled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be held with secret evidence , have no right to prove their innocence , and no right to sue for being tortured .\nWhen we consider the implications of these past court decisions for vaccine laws , the trend is disturbing .\nIn the logic of Dobbs and other cases where individuals sought to be free from government control , clearly , a majority of the Supreme Court will support paternalism and oppose health freedom .\nWho are these six justices ?\nBefore I explain how Dobbs allows for a vaccine-police state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , and legal positions of some of the justices .\n\u2022 Alito ( Princeton undergraduate , Yale Law School ) , supports strip searches of 10-year-old girls , torture and indefinite detention .\nCases here : Doe v. Groody .\nEl Masri v. US , and United States v Husayn ( 2022 ) \u2022 Roberts ( Harvard , Harvard ) held that in the name of public health , the State may order you to give money to a private entity ( for no services ) under penalty of fine and imprisonment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Yale ) worked for Monsanto and claims that actual innocence is not a grounds to appeal a death sentence ( Herrera Collins , 506 U.S. 390 ( 1993 ) , Thomas concurring and Shinn v Ramirez ( 2022 ) ) ; , supports torture and indefinite detention ( Hamdi v. Rumsfeld , 542 U.S. 507 ( 2004 ) , see dissent of Thomas ) , claims that the state can criminalize mere association ( Chicago v Morales , 527 U.S. 41 ( 1999 ) , Thomas dissent ) , and held that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your child is at school \u2013 or just en route to school ( Morse v Frederick , 551 U.S. 393 ( 2007 ) , Thomas concurrence ) .\n\u2022 Kavanaugh ( Yale , Yale ) supports ( i ) qualified immunity for police \u2013 allowing cops to destroy your property and blow up your house ; arrest , maim , torture , and kill any innocent person ( Wesby v. District of Columbia ) and ( ii ) the power of the state to imprison anyone without charge \u2013 and torture the detainee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kiyemba v. Obama , 561 F.3d 505 ( D.C. Cir .\n2009 ) .\n\u2022 Gorsuch ( Columbia , Harvard ) as a lawyer in the Department of Justice during the G. W. Bush administration : ( a ) defended : ( i ) rendition and torture ( of innocent men and children ) ; ( ii ) , indefinite detention of the innocent ; and ( b ) sought to eliminate the right of detainees to petition for a writ of habeas corpus .\n( Charlie Savage ( March 16 , 2017 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disputed Bush-Era Terror Policies \u201d .\nThe New York Times .\np. A13 ) \u2022 Amy Coney Barrett ( Rhodes College of Tennessee , Notre Dame ) , supported the University of Indiana when it imposed a mandatory Covid-19 \u201c vaccine \u201d requirement on all students .\nThat is , she held that a State could bar a person from : ( i ) a public space ; and ( ii ) contracted services ( the right to attend class ) on the basis of submitting to an experimental injection that causes internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even death .\nThe majority offered three relevant themes in Dobbs : ( 1 ) the word abortion is not in the constitution , therefore it is not a right that states must protect ; ( 2 ) courts must extend near-absolute deference to any legislative act that regulates health and or morals ; They wove these ideas under the umbrella of a public policy aimed at protecting others .\nCompulsory vaccination is always justified on the grounds that it is necessary to save others .\nAnd if you want to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less 1789 , you must remember , that such legal reasoning was intertwined with the science of that era , too !\nAs Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist # 84 , the Constitution limits government , not individuals .\nHe said that unjust rulers would declare that save the Bill of Rights , there are no other rights which government must protect .\nJust as the word abortion is not in the Constitution , nor are vaccination and health .\nEven more , sometimes Constitutional dictates are ignored .\nDespite the 6th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States against the right to a jury trial in Baldwin v. New York , 399 U.S. 66 ( 1970 ) .\nIn regard to state-level regulations of public health , aka the \u201c police power \u201d , Dobbs \u2019 holds : \u201c courts [ may ] not substitute their \u2026 beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.\n\u201d Ferguson v. Skrupa , 372 U.S. 726 , 729\u2013730 ; and \u201c A law regulating abortion , like other health and welfare laws , is entitled to a \u201c strong presumption of validity.\n\u201d Heller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 319 .\n\u201c [ Said law ] must be sustained [ by courts ] if there is a rational basis [ sic ] on which the legislature [ thinks ] it would serve legitimate state interests .\n[ Heller ] , at 320.\n\u201d Judges have long ruled that mandatory vaccination laws are based on a belief that vaccination promotes public health , and there is no Constitutional ground to strike or enjoin such a law .\n( See cases Jacobson v. Massachusetts , 197 US 11 ( 1905 ) ; see also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1922 ) . )\nThe third claim undergirding Dobbs is a logical fallacy , an appeal to tradition .\nCiting Timbs v. Indiana ( 2019 ) they wrote : \u201c [ Previous Supreme ] Court \u2026 decisions \u2026 held that the Due Process Clause protects rights [ in ] the first eight Amendments \u2026 and those rights deemed fundamental , [ but ] not mentioned \u2026 .\n\u2026 the question is whether the right is \u201c deeply rooted in [ our ] history and tradition \u201d ; and \u2026 it is essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered liberty.\n\u201d \u201d The Dobbs \u2019 majority chastised the reasoning of Roe .\n\u201c Without any grounding in the constitutional text [ or ] history \u2026 Roe imposed [ sic ] , on the entire country , a detailed set of rules \u2026 [ failed ] to note the overwhelming consensus of state laws \u2026 in 1868 \u2026 and what it said about the common law [ in re abortion ] was simply wrong.\n\u201d What those rights might be , the justices do not say .\nBut Thomas explains : \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history [ and ] legal traditions \u2026 provide the \u2026 \u2018 guideposts for \u2026 decision-making \u2019 \u2026 that direct and restrain \u2026 the Due Process Clause.\n\u201d ( Citing Moore v. East Cleveland , 431 U.S. 494 , 503 ( 1977 ) ) Because mandatory vaccination will be enforced via criminal statutes , we should reflect on the history of American criminal law .\nUnsurprisingly , many laws often criminalized Blackness ( see Loving v. Virginia , 388 U.S. 1 ( 1967 ) ; see also Dred Scott v. Sandford ( 1856 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slave Act ( 1793 ) , though contradicting contemporary English common law , said that \u2018 no one could escape to freedom .\nThe law gave effect to the Extradition Clause ( Article 4 , Section 2 , Clause 2 ) and guaranteed a right for a slaveholder to recover an escaped slave .\nThe \u201c Act respecting fugitives from justice , and persons escaping from the service of their masters , \u201d created the legal mechanism by which that could be accomplished.\n\u2019 ( See Somerset v Stewart ( 1772 ) 98 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held that any enslaved person was manumitted per se by their mere presence on British soil .\n( An example of the Law of the Land ) .\nAmerican colonies and American states outlawed miscegenation .\nThe famous case of Dred Scott v. Sandford ( 1856 ) , paragraph 61 states : \u201c Massachusetts , in 1786 , passed a law \u2026 like the law of 1705 , [ that ] forbids the marriage of any white person with any negro , Indian , or mulatto \u2026 ; and declares all such marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2026 the issue of the marriage [ with ] the stain of bastardy .\n\u2026 [ The ] revised code [ of ] 1836 \u2026 forbids any person from joining in marriage , any white person , with any Indian , negro , or mulatto , and subjects [ offenders ] to imprisonment , not exceeding six months \u2026.\n\u201d America also outlawed , immigration of non-Europeans ( Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 ) , and birth right citizenship for American Indians ( Elk v. Wilkins , 112 U.S. 94 ( 1884 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1875 , targeting Chinese immigrants , then Mexicans and Mexican Americans , and Blacks ( Department of Housing and Urban Development v. Rucker , 535 U.S. 125 ( 2002 ) .\nLaws against vagrancy were purposely designed to re-enslave Blacks .\nHiibel v. Sixth Judicial District .\nCourt of Nevada , Humboldt County , 542 U.S. 177 ( 2004 ) reversed precedent , and upheld a conviction for mere refusal to identify .\nNevertheless , Thomas defends laws that allow police to arrest us for innocent activity , through an appeal to history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent purposes , is [ not ] deeply rooted in this Nation \u2019 s history and tradition , \u201d Chicago v Morales , 527 U.S. 41 , 98 ( 1999 ) .\nNeither is freedom from vaccination deeply rooted in American history .\nFurther , the Dobbs \u2019 majority offers a perverted sense of democracy , and or ignores that the American Constitution is designed to save us from democratic processes .\nIn 1787 , the Constitution was offered with the express provision that her independent judiciary would protect minorities from a numerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy , in Federalist # 10 , James Madison wrote : \u201c a pure democracy , \u2026 there is nothing to check the [ majority faction ] to sacrifice the weaker party \u2026 .\nHence it is that such democracies \u2026 have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property \u2026.\n\u201d The Dobbs majority declared that through Roe , judges were tyrannical , because judges prevented intrusions on liberty !\n\u201c [ After Roe ] , those on the losing side \u2026 could no longer seek to persuade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views .\nThe [ Supreme ] Court short-circuited the democratic process \u2026 to the large number of Americans who disagreed with Roe.\n\u201d But Roe protected a political minority .\nAnd now the Court invites majorities to take away personal security \u2013 in the name of public health .\nSo what now ?\nThe Dobbs \u2019 majority has declared overtly , that exercises of police power will receive deference , under the rubric of rational basis .\nPresently legislatures in California , Maine , New York , West Virginia , and Mississippi have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hepatitis B , pertussis , rubella , chicken pox , meningitis , influenza , measles , polio , diarrhea ( Rota virus ) , diphtheria , and pneumonia .\nThere was no public demand for that .\nVaccine mandates were the product of corporate bribes and PR campaigns .\nThere will be no opting out if States mandate shots ( or jail and fine ) for Covid , yellow fever , leprosy , smallpox , dengue fever , monkey pox , HPV , etc .\nCourts are inclined to uphold any laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey already did it .\nIn May 2020 , Roberts , writing for a 5-4 majority , refused to enjoin state laws which banned church attendance .\n( Though six months later , other judges enjoined a similar New York law , religious freedom is stated plainly in the First Amendment ) .\nImportantly in August 2021 , the same justices in Cuomo , upheld vaccine mandates for students at the University of Indiana .\nAs a political scientist and legal scholar , I offer a last piece of advice : Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state legislators and sheriffs who

, the kind of deprogramming and deradicalizing used against cult members and terrorists .\nAnti-vaxxers were called \u201c hardcore refuseniks \u201d , very difficult to reach because of their ingrained beliefs .\nAfter all , anti-vaxxers are horrible people and refuse everything , even wearing a mask .\nAnd they don \u2019 t think climate change is real either .\nEgads !\nThis particular article citing the quote above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time nearly six million people \u201c who hold a cluster of very exotic beliefs \u201d had refused the jab .\nThese hellions were described as living in their own ecosystem of information .\nOf course , nothing was mentioned about being deliberately lied to with a steady campaign from big pharma and mainstream media .\nMaybe millions are hesitant because of being outright lied to .\nAn article from the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) written more than a year ago also laments the unjabbed , describing vax hesitancy as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifetime.\n\u201d How do we get these rebels to bow to our will ?\nThe article explores ways to coax and coerce the hesitant , allowing the WEF to reach its goal of jabbing 70 % of the world \u2019 s population \u2013 with at least two doses .\nWell , let \u2019 s fast forward to now , July 2022 , and see what that ecosystem of misinformation looks like , shall we ?\nI Will Die If I Take The Jab Yes , you have a very high likelihood of dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vaccine hesitancy came from early reports of sudden death after the jab .\nIt turns out caution was the wisdom of the day .\nLincoln National Life Insurance Company , the fifth largest life insurance company in the US , paid out 163 % more in death benefits for clients ages 18 to 64 in 2021 over payments given out in 2020 .\nThe data is clear , payments were nearly $ 500 million in 2019 ; $ 548 million in 2020 , and $ 1.4 billion in 2021 .\nSince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an average annual US salary of $ 70,000 represents 20,647 more deaths in 2021 than anticipated .\nKeep in mind : this is ONE Life Insurance Company .\nAs of 2020 , there were approximately 742 life insurance companies across the US .\nEngland \u2019 s Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) data ( January 2021 to March 2022 ) shows that nearly 180,000 people died within 60 days of getting injected .\nThey have charts like \u201c Number of Deaths within 28 Days of COVID-19 Vaccination in England \u201d that show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the virus and another 61,000 died due to other causes within 28 days post-jab .\n165,000 died within 60 days post-jab .\nThese data were only released by the UK government after relentless Freedom of Information inquiries .\nAnother UK government entity , the UK Health Security Agency has a vaccine surveillance report showing 92 percent of all the pandemic-related deaths in England are among the jabbed population .\nThe Jab Is Worse Than Covid It turns out that this anti-vaxxer conspiracy theory is also true , thanks to none other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which recently concluded this with a new study .\nThe risk of suffering serious injury due to the jab is a whopping 339 % higher than the risk of a COVID-19 case serious enough to require hospitalization .\nThe 2022 shows that risks from the mRNA gene therapy jabs far , far outweigh any benefit they provide .\nWhen you see that there is a 339 % higher risk of adverse events like cardiac arrest , stroke , or severe neurological diseases , why wouldn \u2019 t you take your chances with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t want to take that chance , and neither did the countless doctors across the globe who saw that these jabs were trouble with a capital \u201c T \u201d .\nDr. Charles Hoffe from British Columbia , Canada , is one example .\nThe good doctor , who had practiced rural medicine for nearly 30 years , gave several hundred doses , then realized there were serious issues .\nHe sounded the alarm , and the medical authorities quickly swooped in on him , removing his hospital privileges and more .\nHe has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of his patients who have been jabbed with the mRNA clot shot .\nAlso true .\nBig surprise !\nMany , many studies and expert immunologists around the world are attributing the rise in COVID-19 to waning vaccine strength , one of the main reasons for the resurgence of the virus .\nCOVID cases are 30 percent higher now than the same time last year .\nThe vaccines wane at about three months , with boosting needed every six months .\nBut wasn \u2019 t that the plan anyway , to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pharma ?\nYes , it seems that it was .\nIn late June , Canada \u2019 s Health Minister demanded citizens get jabbed every 9 months to keep their vax status up to date .\nApparently , the good minister is now following the science : \u201c Scientific studies clearly show that our protection from the initial two-dose vaccine decreases over time.\n\u201d The definition of \u201c fully vaccinated \u201d no longer makes sense at two jabs ; he says it must change to three jabs , with the 9-month boosters .\nHow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 months ?\nThe minister says perhaps forever , as the country will never be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 .\nDespite the constant barrage from the mainstream media to the contrary , there are quite a few countries with people who have remained unjabbed .\nThese include many African nations , like Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo , Haiti , Jamaica , Saint Lucia , the Grenadines , and Yemen .\nThe Presidents of both Burundi and Tanzania , Pierre Nkurunziza and John Magafulli , resisted lockdowns and mandatory jabs early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purporting they were poisoned by the Deep State .\nThese gentlemen were part of the Notorious Nine , labeled by the Deep State for not conforming to the WHO \u2019 s expected orders .\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is also in the group of nine and has emphatically said he will not take the jab nor has he imposed masks and lockdowns on his people .\nHe did not restrict his economy , and he made the jabs freely available to the public should they wish to take it but did not mandate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin , and touts natural immunity as superior to vaccines ( which has always been the case up until the COVID-19 jab for some reason . )\nBolsonaro summed it up well : \u201c If it ( the jab

50-year-old patient but the hospital continued to not address the man \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help the man , the hospital put the doctor in restraints until they decided how to deal with him .\n\u201c A doctor from Florida reported on his recent experience in the hospital .\nDr. Stephen Guffanti was entered into Sarasota Memorial Hospital in early August .\nDuring his stay , he was roomed with another individual who had COVID .\nThe other individual required antibiotics for pneumonia he contracted but the hospital refused to order him the badly needed drugs .\n\u2022 \u201c All you need to

information seems fantastical or even apocalyptic , but is it conspiratorial ?\n\u201c This isn \u2019 t an episode of Saturday morning cartoons .\nSorry to disappoint anyone wanting to test the event horizon theory but I think we \u2019 re stuck here in this time zone for a bit longer , \u201d wrote Researcher Sofia K to a group of concerned citizens who were discussing CERN .\nHer brother , a quantum physicist , has worked on the collider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the collider was built , there was much theory but little way to test these theories outside of a simulation .\nFor example , it is terribly difficult ( or impossible ) to prove that certain particles even exist , let alone predict how they will behave , but our prevailing theories presuppose their existence .\n\u201c With particle acceleration , we are able to sometimes identify surrounding particles that belay the existence of what we \u201c know \u201d we are looking for , and sometimes for a brief moment even actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or changes form.\n\u201d Thanks to the LHC , scientists were able to identify the top quark as well as the Higgs Boson , or \u201c God particle.\n\u201d Both discoveries quite literally opened the door to a whole new world of understanding of our cosmos .\nParticle acceleration allows us to open up the testing ground to the basic fundamental nature of matter and the universe itself .\n\u201c Finally , remember the fundamental limit ?\nThat \u2019 s called Planck Energy .\nThe Planck energy is A QUINTILLION TIMES higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LHC ) maximum.\n\u201d In particle physics and physical cosmology , Planck units are a set of measurements defined exclusively in terms of four universal physical constants .\nThese physical constants take on the numerical value of 1 when expressed in terms of these units .\nTypically , Planck units do not incorporate an electromagnetic dimension .\n\u201c I really do not think there are those twirling their mustaches [ at CERN ] , waiting to see if a black hole swallows the planet , \u201d added Sofia .\nMeanwhile , the mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists at CERN are engaged in anything other than \u201c scientific-related activities \u201d \u2014 whatever that means in the era of Scientism .\nMustachioed villains aside , many do not trust CERN .\nAs far as black holes go , two particles can make a minuscule black hole ( \u201c micro black hole \u201d ) if they collide with an energy above the fundamental limit .\n\u201c The prevailing theory of gravity ( Einstein \u2019 s theory of general relativity ) does not predict that a black hole can actually be made this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and any physicist worth his salt will tell you it \u2019 s impossible , \u201d adds Sofia .\n\u201c \u2026 It would require a total abandonment of physics , quantum field mechanics and frankly , logic.\n\u201d Yet CERN admits their collider could produce black holes , just not the type that you \u2019 re thinking of in space that would diminish humanity .\nOn its official website , CERN says that the creation of black holes at the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) is \u201c very unlikely.\n\u201d But while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cosmological sense , it is possible that it may form \u201c tiny quantum black holes.\n\u201d According to a website by the 2011 Hollywood movie Demons and Angels , they say such a black hole would harmlessly decay back into ordinary particles .\nCERN , which partnered with Ron Howard , adds that the observation of such an event would be thrilling in terms of our understanding of the universe , but it \u201c presents no danger \u201d and \u201c would be perfectly safe.\n\u201d They claim there is no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow physicists to learn more about gravity , the force which causes mutual attraction between all things that have mass or energy .\nThe creation of a black hole at the LHC would confirm theories that our universe is not four-dimensional ( 3 space plus 1-time dimensions ) but indeed hosts other dimensions .\nIf CERN admits there are dimensions beyond four ( there are ) , how do we know the black holes decay or don \u2019 t vanish somewhere else ?\nAnd , if their man-made magnetic fields are roughly 200,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how do we know for certain that there are no repercussions \u2014 negative or otherwise ?\nAccording to research brought forth by Frank Jacob , CERN is trying to penetrate through the 11th dimension .\nJacob , an award-winning independent filmmaker who just released a three-part , deep-dive webinar exploring the history of Project Looking Glass , says scientists determined that slightly more energy is needed to create mini-black holes at the LHC than previously thought .\nUntil now , the LHC has searched for mini-black holes with energy levels below 5.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s rainbow theory , \u201d this energy is too low .\nAccording to Cern \u2019 s Mir Faizal , instead , the model predicts that black holes can form at energy levels of at least 9.5 TeC in six dimensions and 11.9 TeV in ten dimensions .\nSince the LHC is designed to reach 14 TeV in six dimensions and 11.9 TeV in the tenth dimension .\nSince the LHC is designed to reach 14 TeV in future runs , this predicted energy requirement should be accessible for black hole production.\n\u201d I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder how this impacts planet Earth ?\nIn 2008 , a lawsuit was filed against CERN for endangering humans .\nThe suit mentioned the black holes .\nHowever , CERN is a sovereign entity outside any court \u2019 s jurisdiction , making them ultimately untouchable .\nEven Stephen Hawking left CERN because of their shenanigans .\n\u201c I am an atheist but \u2026 The Hadron Collider could open a gateway to HELL \u201d , Hawking once said .\n\u201c The globalists believe only in rocks , atoms , and molecules , no soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play God , \u201d adds Jacob .\n\u201c They [ globalists ] figure it \u2019 s their right to take the power .\nIn some ways , they are much more aligned than the \u2018 new agers \u2019 , actually .\nThey know what they want and where they are going .\nWe can learn from that.\n\u201d I personally know I don \u2019 t want a soul-less future .\nAre we to spend a billion dollars a year for an orbital motorway that is \u2018 super safe \u2019 or a space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to a strange text , Sergio Bertolucci , Director for Research and Scientific Computing at CERN , claims \u201c the LHC says that the titanic machine may possibly create or discover previously unimagined scientific phenomena , or \u2018 unknown unknowns \u2019 \u2013 for instance \u2018 an extra dimension.\n\u2019 Out of this door might come something , or we might send something through it.\n\u201d Bertolucci adds that this \u2018 open door \u2019 would be able to be held open for \u201c a very tiny lapse of time , 10-26 seconds.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , they would be able to peer into this open door , either by getting something out of it or sending something into it .\n\u201c Of course , \u201d adds Bertolucci , \u201c after this tiny moment the door would again shut , bringing us back to our \u2018 normal \u2019 four-dimensional world \u2026 It would be a major leap in our vision of Nature , although of no practical use ( for the time being , at least ) .\n\u201d The last time CERN was turned up to full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world .\nThe Earth \u2019 s magnetosphere was affected , and an unexplained \u201c spiral \u201d was observed in Norway .\nThen on July 13 , 2016 , Dr. Edward Mantill , a CERN physicist , was found dead in his office from a self-inflicted gunshot wound .\n\u201c This is NOT what the machine was designed for , nor is it what the machine has been used for since its inception .\nCERN \u2019 s main purpose for building the Collider was to , well , it was to open a doorway.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ LHC was a waste of money ?\n\u00ae \u201d \u2014 to echo the strange text that I found online .\nMantill had been researching a hidden code in the movement of the neutrinos from the north to the south magnetic poles .\nHis colleague said Mantill hadn \u2019 t slept for days after he had allegedly given up his research and had shut himself off in his office .\nAfter a couple of days of not showing up for appointments , he was found in his office , fatally wounded .\nHe had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trash bin and his computer had been wiped clean of everything except one text file .\n\u201c Our universe is but one page in a large book .\nThink of a closed book sitting on a table : you see each page stacked on top of one another , bound by the spine and sandwiched between the two covers .\nOur universe is but one page in a vast and all-encompassing book .\nAnd our page is certainly not the only one with rich , in-depth thought and writing committed to it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ different dimension each with its own unique writing , own unique story , own unique way of isolating itself from the other pages .\nNo page was to interact with the other , just as no ink bleeds from one page to another in a standard book .\nEach page is a universe unto itself.\n\u201d But was Mantill even real ?\nWhen I searched for more about this man , nothing existed about him online .\nWas it because he was fictional or because the Ministry of Truth had scrubbed his existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I am sure they can digitally assassinate someone if they so wish .\nI even found an IMDB post suggesting he was fabricated .\nAlthough Jacob had never heard of Mantill , he says his final words are \u2018 totally on the money.\n\u2019 \u201c If this is fiction , it is very eery .\nI know of a physicist who came forward in 2019 with info about the true goings-on in CERN .\nThat scientist was found dead two weeks after.\n\u201d Mantill discussed how the new synthetic humans would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agenda , and that the human species was in store for a Great Reset of an explosive kind unless we wised up .\nAdds Jacob , CERN is already creating explosions in energy that are affecting the Schumann resonances .\nMother Earth \u2019 s natural heartbeat rhythm is the frequency of 7.83 Hz , also known as the \u201c Schumann Resonance \u201d .\nA 7.83 Hz frequency is an alpha/theta brainwave frequency in the human brain .\nNikola Tesla remarked that our entire biological system , the brain , and the earth itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequencies are controlled by reflection levels .\nIf you maintain that CERN would have no impact on our earth \u2019 s hum , consider the inconceivable energies the collider is releasing .\nDieter Boers who has been studying the Schumann Resonance for 40 years says that while it sounds whacky , it \u2019 s physically possible .\nListen to Frank Jacob and Boers explore how quantum computers and HAARP may also be interacting with CERN .\nMeanwhile , 2029 seems to be a key year to complete certain plans .\nJacob thinks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how we participate now will have an impact on creating the future .\nFor more on CERN check out : \u2022 None DEMONIC DIMENSIONS AND THE MYSTERIES OF CERN

running around the clock collecting data .\nThe data collection effort will continue for the next four years at a record energy of 13.6 trillion electronvolts ( TeV ) \u2014 slightly higher than in Run 2 , which reached 13 TeV .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and fire up once more in 2029 .\nThe LHC has cost $ 9.2 billion to build so far .\nThe process works by activating two beams of

and analyzed by thousands of scientists as part of a raft of experiments , including ATLAS , CMS , ALICE , and LHCb , which will use the enhanced power to probe dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other fundamental

specific particles or other elements of physics .\nThey build on LHC \u2019 s discoveries made during its Run 1 ( 2009-2013 ) and Run 2 ( 2015-2018 ) .\nThe upgrades to the LHC include boosting its

particular particle called the \u201c beauty quark.\n\u201d Scientists think the beauty quark can teach them more about the differences between matter and its opposite-charged destructive twin anti-matter .\nWhen matter and antimatter touch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bang ought to have created matter and antimatter in equal amounts , but it seems to have made excess matter\u2014 the matter that surrounds us .\nThis imbalance has no explanation .\nAntimatter is the most harmful substance in our universe .\nIn 2018 , they literally figured out a way to trap and truck it from one facility to another .\nThe contents were equivalent to about 20 Hiroshima atomic bombs .\nCERN scientists are exploring whether matter and antimatter interact similarly with gravity , or whether antimatter would

COVID-19 Is No Longer A Threat, Says the CDC", "content": "And just like that , the unvaccinated and the vaccinated can now both be treated like equal human beings .\nThe CDC very quietly released new COVID-19 guidance that puts an end to the stigmatizing and downright shaming that the unjabbed have had to endure for the past two-and-a-half years .\nWe can finally stop staying six feet apart .\nNo more social distancing , because the CDC says we no longer have to .\nIn fact , we don \u2019 t even have to quarantine anymore if we are exposed to an infected person , because the CDC says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is absolutely incredible to see the mainstream media ( MSM ) spin on the CDC \u2019 s latest declaration .\nIn Texas , we call it bootlicking .\nThis article by the Associated Press fawns all over itself to declare the CDC the \u201c nation \u2019 s top health agency.\n\u201d They should be , given their budget .\nThe AP article seems to herald the CDC \u2019 s decision as a brilliant move \u201c driven by a recognition that most Americans 16 and older have acquired some level of immunity.\n\u201d CDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new guideline authors , made a brilliant quote : \u201c The current conditions of this pandemic are very different from those of the last two years.\n\u201d Bravo , Greta .\nYou seem really smart .\nSpeaking of Greta , why is a senior scientist in the Division of Violence Prevention at the CDC authoring guidelines ?\nMassetti is the CDC lead for creating surveys on the global Violence Against Children \u201c to determine the magnitude and nature of violence against children in multiple countries.\n\u201d The CDC is a US agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill for a violence prevention programs around the globe ?\nWhy is the CDC involved with the global effort called Together for Girls ?\nThat \u2019 s what nonprofits are for , not the CDC .\nThis report by CBS News praises the CDC even more .\nIt describes the new guidelines as \u201c significant \u201d and a \u201c sweeping overhaul \u201d that was \u201c unveiled \u201d , which is funny because so many places have not required social distancing or masking for many months .\nIn my view , the CDC is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us .\nIt \u2019 s almost as if the pandemic won \u2019 t be over until the CDC says it is over .\nDespite the fact that you may live in a town that is completely back to normal with no one contracting COVID ( and certainly no one dying of it ) , you must act at threat level 5 , if the CDC says it is so .\nBy the way , CBS News makes a habit of promoting stories of this nature .\nCBS Morning recently touted a study showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in childhood obesity .\nWhat ?\nYes , that \u2019 s right .\nHere \u2019 s a link to the severely flawed journal article claiming warming temperatures = less active children = more obese children .\nWTH ?\nClimate Warming is responsible for literally EVERYTHING .\nOne of their sentences even sounds like Greta wrote it herself , but she didn \u2019 t : The flack has been quite fitting .\nThe Dispatch \u2019 s editor-in-chief Jonah Goldberg said : But once again , I digress .\nBack to Greta and the CDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious : These people are actually patting themselves on their collective backs for authoring sweeping guidance to suppress the rest of us .\nAnd of course , they have to throw in that magic phrase \u201c the pandemic is not over.\n\u201d If they have their way , it will never be over .\nThe CBS article portrays two of my favorite traits of Washington DC bureaucrats : 1 ) they over-complicate nearly everything and 2 ) they talk down to the rest of us dimwits who obviously can \u2019 t make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government first .\nBoth are absolutely ludicrous , and so is Greta , by the way .\nAll of a sudden , the US government will not be differentiating between the jabbed and unjabbed .\nTesting is no longer required in most places .\nYou only have to wear a mask if you \u2019 ve tested positive , but you can quit wearing it if you re-test negative twice in a row .\n( really ?\nIsn \u2019 t repeatedly testing a healthy person a sign of mental illness ? )\nOh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gatherings are no longer required .\nIt \u2019 s kind of sad , really , because the CDC views these changes as sweeping .\nThey \u2019 ve been living in their own little bubble , proven once again so aptly by Massetti , who said a \u201c myriad of federal COVID-19 guidance regulations are now in an easier to use framework.\n\u201d Translation : CDC previously overcomplicated EVERYTHING about their guidelines and no one has a Rosetta Stone big enough to untangle their web .\nDo You Get it ?\nMassetti then continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s really about kind of how people can understand how all of these components fit together.\n\u201d Huh ?\nMassetti says they \u2019 ve created brand new drawings to help us simple folk assess the likelihood that we were infected , and they \u2019 ve also created a simplified guide on what to do if you were exposed to the infection .\nBut wait , not so fast .\nThe jab mandates are not part of the CDC \u2019 s sweeping changes .\nMandates are still in place , despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jabbed has greatly reduced in the last few months .\nIn particular , the number of kids being jabbed has not really changed , despite the fact that the CDC STILL recommends these death shots for kids as young as 6 months old .\nDr. Bhattacharya Gets It Right In a fantastic Epoch Times piece , Stanford University School of Medicine professor Dr. Jay Bhattacharya says the quiet part out loud : the CDC got it wrong from the beginning .\nHe says changing direction is how big government agencies admit they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain words for us simple folk , but instead make \u201c sweeping changes.\n\u201d He is absolutely right .\nBhattacharya has been a voice of reason from the very beginning .\nHe advocated common sense measures like extra protection for the elderly but fewer restrictions on others .\nTwo of the more glaring CDC errors , he points out , are the agency \u2019 s downplay of natural immunity and unprecedented policies associated with asymptomatic testing .\nHe says CDC is \u201c two years too late \u201d with these recommendations .\nOnce again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never come out and say it was wrong .\nThey will say things like \u201c everyone is more immunized \u201d and \u201c the science has changed \u201d and \u201c we are streamlining the guidance.\n\u201d ( Oh , wait , Greta already said that , didn \u2019 t she ? )\nAnd they \u2019 ll bolster their decision with tons of paid-for journal article citations .\nThe interesting part is that many of these papers were published back in 2020 , waiting for the \u2018 right time \u2019 to be released .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c You \u2019 re a day late and a dollar short.\n\u201d Big agencies like the CDC never want to find themselves short on dollars .\nThis is one of the reasons you will never hear big government agencies admit fault : they want their budgets to keep increasing .\nThey justify this by saying things like \u201c we now have more tools \u201d or \u201c we \u2019 re in a stronger place as a nation \u201d .\nIt is no surprise that Greta says exactly this in the Epoch Times article .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ wigs like former Surgeon General Jerome Adams step up to the plate on their behalf .\nAdams says that in no way should the CDC \u2019 s changed guidance be interpreted as the agency being wrong .\nSee how it works ?\nYou might be interested to know that the CDC just requested a FY2023 budget of $ 10.68 billion dollars from the Biden regime .\nThe agency is asking for $ 2.3 billion more than in FY2022 .\nPart of the budget justification is that CDC wants to defeat diseases and epidemics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help end the HIV/AIDS epidemic .\nBut wait , haven \u2019 t they been saying every year that they will eradicate HIV ?\nWhat \u2019 s different about this year ?\nOh wait , Greta answered that for us earlier : \u201c the science has changed.\n\u201d CDC \u2019 s new budget will also help usher in a Vaccines for Adults program and , of course , money to invest in \u2018 pandemic preparedness , \u2019 because we haven \u2019 t had enough time over the last 16 years since Bird Flu ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ll end with another profound quote from Dr. Rochelle Walensky , the CDC Director herself : That \u2019 s right , she is actually telling you that a $ 2.3 billion budget increase paid for by you as a taxpayer is going to alleviate the economic burden you \u2019 ve endured during this pandemic .\nLike what you \u2019 re reading on The Tenpenny Report ?\nShare this article with your friends .\nHelp us grow .\nFed Up Texas Chick

Gates instead .\nWhile doing research into the monkeypox virus ( MPXV ) , I didn \u2019 t need to go far to find the mad sweater-wearing ghoul .\nOn July 29th , on the heels of the World Hoax Organization ( WHO ) announcing monkeypox as the next \u201c plandemic , \u201d National Public Radio ( NPR ) put out a story that received little fanfare or coverage .\nI wondered why NPR would even publish such a story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cares about the truth .\nMoreover , NPR had accepted tons of money from the Gates Foundation in the past .\nWas the article a confession to cover their behinds with the assumption that no one would connect the dots ?\nI also wondered exactly what meddlings Gates had had in Nigeria .\nSure enough , the country sold its soul to the devil .\nBefore I share my findings \u2013 first an update on monkeypox ( I imagine WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus saying this out loud with his heavy Ethiopian accent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his expert panel , Tedros made a unilateral decision against a majority vote and declared monkeypox \u201c an emergency and a public health emergency of international concern \u201d ( PHEIC ) .\nIf you visit the MonkeyPox Meter , supposedly the cases worldwide have gone from zero to 22,000+ in as little as three months , including more than 4,000 cases in the US .\nFive days after Tedros \u2019 announcement , the Mayor of San Francisco declared a \u201c state of emergency \u201d due to monkeypox .\nIncidentally , Shit Francisco is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and transgender populations who are supposedly at high risk of monkeypox ( if that \u2019 s true , perhaps they are being targeted , just like in the days of AIDS . )\nThe city already has a waitlist for when a monkeypox vaccine becomes available .\nMany have reported that announcing monkeypox is really a cover-up for the damage done from the COVID jabs on the immune system , similar to what we \u2019 ve seen as shingles , autoimmune blistering disease , and herpes infections .\nIncidentally , when I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , Twitter threw me in jail .\nLater , I learned it was tied to Tedros \u2019 invitation to social media platforms to work with the WHO to counter \u201c monkeypox disinformation.\n\u201d What about that monkeypox jab ?\nEvery country that has reported alleged cases of monkeypox since May 2022 , where it was not already endemic , is also a country that has distributed the Pfizer COVID-19 injection .\n\u201c Monkeypox could very well be a herpes infection that is jab induced , in fact , that \u2019 s likely\u2026 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to find a paper trail or some smoking gun that confirms this and instead will continue to have to rely on circumstantial and anecdotal evidence , \u201d says Sofia K , a scientist who is part of a medical freedom group I belong to .\n\u201c Unfortunately , or fortunately ; depending on whether you chose to get the COVID-19 injection , official government data and confidential Pfizer documents strongly suggest the COVID-19 injection may be reactivating the dormant chickenpox virus or herpes virus due to the frightening damage it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Expose-News .\nCase in point : the CDC even updated the monkeypox case definition to include varicella & herpes zoster rashes !\n!\nAdditionally , post MRNA jab , more latent viruses are rearing their ugly head .\nHerpes viruses ( like many ) are opportunistic infections that store in the nerve ganglia and can be \u201c reactivated \u201d when your immune system is either busy elsewhere or depressed .\nThere are dots that connect .\n\u201c This means we may not be witnessing a worldwide outbreak of monkeypox at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences of administering an experimental injection to millions of people , \u201d writes Expose-News .\nBut not so fast .\nThere \u2019 s more .\nRemember , the overlords never let a crisis go to waste .\nIn this inverted upside-down world , plandemics serve many purposes , and the truth is multi-layered .\nSo what else is going on ?\nFive years ago , Dr. Dimie Ogoina said he saw the most important patient of his career \u2013 an 11-year-old whose infection would eventually be linked to the largest monkeypox outbreak in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks after diagnosing the young boy , Ogoina \u201c became concerned \u2013 quite concerned.\n\u201d The outbreak in Nigeria began to grow rapidly .\nCases cropped up in counties not just near this one boy , but all over .\n\u201c Suddenly , we were seeing cases appear across the country , \u201d Ogoina said .\nThe boy was the first case of monkeypox in Nigeria in 38 years .\nBut not the last .\nEventually , they figured out that the young boy didn \u2019 t catch the virus from playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but rather from a male relative in his household .\nAnd rather than rashes on their face and extremities , blisters occurred around their genitals .\n\u201c They had very extensive genital lesions .\nVery , very extensive , \u201d Ogoina says .\nTo Dr. Ogoina , clearly , the virus had changed .\nAdditionally , months after accusing the United States of having biological laboratories in Ukraine , Russia revealed that there are at least four US-operated biological laboratories in Nigeria \u2013 in Abuja , Zaria , and Lagos \u2013 from where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u201c hows \u201d are convoluted , they started spreading through sexual contact for the first time five years ago .\nOgoina and his colleagues even mentioned this occurrence in a study published in 2019 : \u201c Although the role of sexual transmission of human monkeypox is not established , sexual transmission is plausible in some of these patients through close , skin-to-skin contact during sexual intercourse or by transmission via genital secretions , \u201d Ogoina and his colleagues wrote in the journal PLOS One .\n\u201c Yes , someone told me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , \u201d Ogoina recalls with exasperation in his voice .\n\u201c I was told , \u2018 We should not worry about sexual transmission.\n\u2019 \u201c Who told him to stay silent ?\nWas this when monkeypox first started spreading sexually ?\nWas a messed-with gain-of-function monkeypox virus circulating in Nigeria that far back ?\nWhat if whatever was going on was spread via a vaccine ?\nDr. Ogoina didn \u2019 t respond to my email message .\nAt the time of his observation , Nigeria didn \u2019 t have the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had to send our samples to Senegal and even to the US to make a diagnosis , \u201d he says .\n\u201c We had to wait.\n\u201d Not surprisingly , they were instructed to use the unreliable PCR test which ratcheted up cases on demand .\nReports emerged that the NIH and Wuhan Lab had been working on monkeypox prior to the outbreak .\nIn a scientific article in Virologica Sinica , the official journal of the Chinese Society of Microbiology , the authors explained the process for artificially engineering a monkeypox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute of Virology published a study in February 2022 \u2013 months before the outbreak \u2013 in which they described creating a portion of a monkeypox genome from scratch in order to develop a PCR test for monkeypox diagnosis .\nCuriously , the paper states that , because there \u2019 s never been a monkeypox outbreak in China , \u201c the viral genomic material required for PCR detection is unavailable.\n\u201d What are the risks inherent in creating synthetic viruses ?\nThat aside , the data indicates that , indeed , the monkeypox outbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolutionary biologist Michael Worobey at the University of Arizona , who has been analyzing the statistics .\nInstead , the transmission of the virus went underground in Nigeria for years .\nWhy ?\nWas it because the Medical Cartel told the media not to report on an actual Hegelian ( \u201c Problem-Reaction-Solution \u201d ) purposeful outbreak ?\nEventually , Worobey believes the outbreak spread to other countries and turned into the growing international outbreak the world is fighting now .\nWorobey hasn \u2019 t published his analysis yet , but he says the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s clear that there \u2019 s been continuous cases \u2013 or endemic transmission \u2013 in Nigeria since 2017 , possibly even a bit earlier .\nSubsequently , something from there got exported out [ to the rest of world ] .\n\u201d Why didn \u2019 t health officials listen to Ogoina ?\nAnd perhaps more importantly , what exactly was Bill Gates \u2019 the reasoning for his presence in Nigeria in the 2017 timeframe ?\nStay tuned for Part 2

Vigilance Real-World Study Says .\nThe title speaks for itself .\n\u2022 In August , a separate group of researchers assured us no issues were found , even though they admitted that male infertility

has not commented on the study .\nMany people who have read this paper argue that the actual data doesn \u2019 t support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after five months .\nIn fact , it appears sperm levels continue to decline .\nIn fact , blaming the \u201c transitory \u201d levels on fever/inflammation appears to be a diversion .\nHowever , Alex Berenson and others who carefully studied the supplementary graphs disagree that the decline is temporary .\nIn February 2021 , \u201c shaming \u201d articles appeared , calling people like Dr. Joseph Mercola \u201c quacks \u201d for expressing concern over the lipid nanoparticles in these jabs .\nMercola simply stated the truth : the lipid nanoparticle delivery system had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine or drug yet was being used in the shots .\nWe were told the injection would stay in the arm , but it was soon determined that the shot ingredients , including the mRNA , quickly migrated to other parts of the body .\nIn the female body , the primary destination appeared to be the ovaries .\n\u2022 In March 2021 , in one of the earliest known VAERS reports , more than 30 women had spontaneous miscarriages or stillbirths after receiving the jab .\nThe CDC brushed it off as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another article chided the public for believing misinformation .\nInterestingly , as I read studies for this article , I found there was a common phrase used throughout : \u201c Misinformation regarding Covid vaccination has contributed to vaccine hesitancy.\n\u201d I was surprised to this rhetoric permeating scientific publications .\n\u2022 By August 2021 , miscarriages were becoming a significant issue .\nFormer Pfizer VP Dr. Michael Yeadon urged pregnant women or women who wanted to become pregnant to opt out of the jab .\nYeadon doubled down , stating that in the

irregularities began after their first dose .\n\u2022 By February 2022 , there were enough abnormal reports in the EU to prompt the European Medicines Agency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of menstruation from women who had received either the Pfizer or Moderna jabs .\n\u2022 The June 2022 Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) data is disturbing .\nSigns are not good for women of reproductive age .\nWhen compared to flu vaccines , the COVID jabs are associated with a 1,000x increase in menstrual disorders and 50x increases in miscarriages .\nRemember when the CDC said there was no risk to fertility ?\nOh but it gets so much worse .\nThe Children \u2019 s Health Defense sent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the CDC that stunningly admitted it has never looked at VAERS for any safety signals regarding these jabs .\nIt \u2019 s their job : Birth rates are dropping all around the world .\n\u2022 In February 2022 , Israeli government data showed a nearly 3 % drop in birth rate from the previous year ; Israel is one of the most jabbed countries .\n\u2022 In June 2022 , Japan reported its largest natural population decline in history as birthrates fall lower than ever before .\n\u2022 In July , Sweden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but health officials seem dumbfounded as to the reason .\n\u2022 Birth rates across the globe are dropping : Taiwan ( > 23 % ) , Germany ( 11 % ) and the UK ( ~8 % ) , among many others .\n\u2022 Data from Public Health Scotland shows ovarian cancer at an all-time high and critical levels of newborn deaths .\nTheir own VAERS system shows a whopping 1,517 % increased risk of miscarriage post-jab .\nBut the best source is Pfizer itself , where the company \u2019 s own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 82 % and 97 % .\nThese documents also show that the jab ingredients do indeed accumulate in the ovaries .\nIf you are lucky enough to give birth , but then decide to Covid-jab your baby ( which you should NEVER do ) , your baby might survive but is likely to have

around .\nHere is the conclusion of my 3 part series .\nOn May 21st , two days after the Portuguese researchers presented their first draft , Andrew Rambaut from the University of Edinburgh started a discussion on the ongoing MPXV genome sequencing .\nBut strangely the page was scrubbed .\nDuring the discussion , Andrew predicted that \u201c all or most of these mutations arose in a single round of replication.\n\u201d He also suspected that the mutations occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rodent .\nBack in February 2022 , Virologica Sinica published a study titled \u201c Combined Insertion of Basic and Non-basic Amino Acids at Hemaglutinin Cleavage Site of Highly Pathogenic H7N9 Virus Promotes Replication and Pathogenicity in Chickens and Mice.\n\u201d It appears this monkeypox contains a similar style of research to H7N9 .\n\u201c We characterized the reconstituted viruses in terms of viral replication in avian and mammalian cells , thermostability and acid stability , cleavage efficiency , the virulence in mice , and pathogenicity and transmissibility in chickens , \u201d outlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c the H7N9 variant caused a 35 percent mortality rate in mice , with researchers noting that certain amino acids \u2018 increased the pathogenicity.\n\u2019 \u201d Meanwhile , both the BMJ study and the Portuguese researchers outlined that the current outbreak was most closely related to viruses \u201c associated with the exportation of monkeypox virus from Nigeria to several countries in 2018 and 2019 , namely the United Kingdom , Israel , and Singapore.\n\u201d By the way , Tedros acknowledged that \u201c the sudden appearance of monkeypox in many countries at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undetected transmission for some time.\n\u201d Since the early days in Nigeria , the current virus has seemingly changed .\nAgain .\nLook at the table below : What is disturbing is that there have been 47 mutations from those 2018-2019 viruses which the authors say \u201c is far more than one would expect , considering the estimated substitution rate for Orthopoxviruses.\n\u201d Normally , in these types of viruses , there are 1-2 nucleotide changes per year .\nIn a Naked Emperor \u2019 s Substack titled Was the Current Monkeypox Strain Engineered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentions a person named Jikky who noted that as well as the mutation , there has been a deletion which could indicate that serial passaging through a cell line has taken place .\nWhen I went to contact Jikky on Twitter , his account had been suspended .\nI located a study that looked at the genetic variability , including gene duplication and deletion , in early sequences from the 2022 European monkeypox outbreak .\nThe study stated : \u201c We should NOT be complacent regarding the current outbreak , based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkeypox ] we have known for the last 64 years may not resemble near-future human MPXV.\n\u201d Some researchers flagged the methods , stating they were used for potentially creating a \u201c contagious pathogen.\n\u201d Jikky concluded that given the mutations in such a short space of time , this version \u201c could only happen by taking a lab strain of monkeypox and then passaging it through cells in the presence of a mutagen.\n\u201d Bioweapons expert Dr. Frances Boyle agrees : \u201c It \u2019 s obvious that monkeypox is a biological warfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why it \u2019 s so infectious.\n\u201d Do you really think this new pandemic is random versus planned ?\nWhat is the true purpose of using gain-of-function with monkeypox ?\nTo help further the culling of humanity ?\nTo scare us from touching each other and things in order to bring in a cashless society ?\nTo justify more lockdowns in time for the elections ?\nTo hide side effects of the jab ?\nAll of it ?\nAnd was Nigeria used as a testing ground for what was to come ?\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind , smallpox has left the oldest and the deepest scars .\nAfter incubating QUIETLY for five to 10 days , the virus manifests suddenly , \u201d writes Ken Alibek in his book BioHazard .\nRead the book for yourself or watch the BBC film titled Silent Weapon : Smallpox and Biological Warfare , based on his story .\nIn 1992 , Alibek , once a top scientist in the Soviet Union \u2019 s biological weapons program , defected from the Soviet Union and revealed to Western intelligence that he had overseen an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a highly effective biological weapon .\nSmallpox , which is related to monkeypox ( also referred to as the Variola virus ( VARV ) ) , killed millions around the world every year before it was eradicated in 1980 .\nSmallpox is estimated to have killed up to 90 percent of Indigenous people in the Americas in the centuries following European arrival .\nMonkeypox is nowhere near lethal .\nThe truth is ; smallpox with a 30 percent fatality rate , has also been turned into a bioweapon .\nThe Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labs that have altered smallpox through Gain of Function measures .\nSo what happens when you use a smallpox vaccine for monkeypox ?\nDoes anyone care that even Fauci admitted years ago that the smallpox vaccine is toxic , and that in 2002 , Sixty Minutes stated that scientists called the original smallpox vaccine , first created in 1776 , \u201c the most dangerous vaccine known to man ?\n\u201d Do you recall when Big Pharma and the media whores started suggesting people mix and match different COVID-19 injections ?\nWell , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallpox vaccine for monkeypox since they haven \u2019 t manufactured a monkeypox shot yet .\nDumping older stockpiles into human subjects is nothing new .\nFor instance , it \u2019 s common for pharmaceuticals to rename a problematic vaccine in their \u201c Strategic National Stockpile \u201d and introduce it in another country .\nAbra Abra Cadabra , I want to reach out and jab ya .\nThe irony is that the Medical Cartel gets to use smallpox \u2018 off label \u2019 but persecutes Ivermectin for use in COVID-19 .\nThe Daily Mail stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed , and that US National Stockpile dwindled down to 1000s because health agencies believed smallpox was the next vector and they had plenty of that jab made .\nLess than a decade ago , the United States had some 20 million doses of a new smallpox vaccine \u2014 also effective against monkeypox \u2014 sitting in freezers .\n\u201c The raw , unfinished vaccine remains stored in large plastic bags outside Copenhagen , at the headquarters of the small Danish biotech company Bavarian Nordic , which developed Jynneos ( formerly called Imvamune ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes The New York Times .\nDenmark was the first place smallpox was cultivated .\nIn the interim , there are so-called \u2018 smallpox therapeutics.\n\u201d For instance , Brincidofovir , which may work in a \u201c lethal monkeypox virus animal model.\n\u201d In September 2021 , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved tecovirimat ( TPOXX ) , which is used to treat herpes , as a \u201c successful step forward in smallpox preparedness .\nHowever , because orthopoxviruses can become resistant to treatment , they add that a multi-therapeutic approach is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gates began seeding the narrative .\nHe theorized about what would unfold \u201c \u2026if a bioterrorist brought smallpox to 10 airports ?\n\u201d According to Dr. Mercola , the NIH identified monkeypox as a potential bioterrorism agent .\n\u201c While known VARV stocks are secure , smallpox remains a bioterrorist threat agent , \u201d states a study titled \u201c Teaching a new mouse old tricks : Humanized mice as an infection model for Variola virus.\n\u201d Just like CoronaCon , an entire industry is materializing as part of the World Economic Forum \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating hysteria and manufacturing demand for a smallpox vaccine with about 85 percent effectiveness in \u201c preventing monkeypox , \u201d according to our reliable friends at The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security .\nAnd now on August 4th , after certain states like New York and cities like San Francisco declared a state of emergency , HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra declared monkeypox a public health emergency in the entire United States .\n\u201c This time it will get your attention.\n\u201d We think they are Crying Wolf , and in part they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are using a silent weapon to run more experiments ?\nConsider that on May 11 , 1987 , The London Times reported that the W.H.O .\ngave 50 million laced smallpox vaccines that \u201c triggered \u201d the AIDS virus .\nNow , I have no doubt that the COVID jab from hell is a factor in this new plandemic .\nBut perhaps , as we are making memes and rap songs , and making fun of the jabbed sheeple , there is more happening than fear

doing in Nigeria in 2017 ?\nI didn \u2019 t have to go far to find the answer .\nBefore the monkeypox outbreak , Gates and billionaire philanthropist , Aliko Dangote , met with Nigeria \u2019 s officials , and subsequently declared that Nigeria was doomed to poverty , and was one of the most dangerous places to give birth in the world .\nThe country was so poor that there were even some accounts of some parents trading their young children in for debt .\nFortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that there was hope given their abundant resources and their \u2018 huge population.\n\u2019 Nigeria could still join the League of Nations and mingle with upper middle income people from China , Brazil , and Mexico .\nQuantum leaps depended on the choices made by the political leadership , and this involved reordering national priorities .\nUnfortunately , only a few Nigerian leaders , such as Governor of Kaduna State Nasir El-Rufai , were wise and gutsy enough to brand Gates \u2018 a liar.\n\u2019 Obianuju Ekeocha , a Nigerian-born biomedical scientist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a UK-based pro-life group , argued on BBC \u2019 s Sunday Morning Live that the Gates Foundation \u2019 s push for contraception in Africa might be \u201c an insidious way of moving forward their agenda of population control , \u201d because they were opposed to the high number of children thought to be desirable in many African countries .\nEkeocha clarified that while family planning programs were not \u201c bad in and of themselves , \u201d the real problem was that billions of dollars were flowing into the country from the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to control their local populations.\n\u201d Incidentally , Nigeria has the second largest HIV population in the world .\nOfficials began giving antiretroviral drugs regardless of side effects to HIV-infected patients engaging in unprotected sexual intercourse .\nAfter meddling in reproduction services , Gates moved on to injections and the food supply .\nIn a 2016 Gates Foundation press release , the Nigerian governors partnered with Gates , Dangote Foundation , and USAID to bring \u201c life-saving vaccines to children.\n\u201d In 2017 , Gates mentioned on his website , GatesNotes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had won the World Food Prize .\nDespite growing up poor , Adesina went on to earn a Ph.D. in agricultural economics and then worked for the Rockefeller Foundation , which facilitated his rise to Nigeria \u2019 s minister of agriculture .\nHe also served as Vice President of nonprofit Policy and Partnerships for the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa ( AGRA ) .\nWould you be surprised to learn the Bill & Melinda Gates and Rockefeller Foundation founded AGRA back in 2006 ?\nGates \u2019 spent ( laundered ? )\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeds and agrochemicals , but AGRA failed to fulfill its promises to alleviate hunger and to lift small-scale farmers out of poverty , according to a white paper published by the Tufts University Global Development and Environment Institute .\nAccording to Corey Digs , AGRA \u2019 s first-ever evaluation report published February 28 , 2022 reveals their 15-year effort was a FAIL .\n\u201c Evaluators stated there were many deficiencies and AGRA \u2019 s reporting and monitoring data was weak\u2026 AGRA \u2019 s bold claims to \u2018 double yields and incomes for 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed from their website in June 2020 , following Tufts University \u2019 s findings that documented a 31 % increase in hunger , \u201d she writes in her report .\nBill Gates and his evil cohorts promised a revolution in Nigeria , but instead , they meddled in reproduction services , took over farming , issued genetically modified seeds , poisoned the soil , imploded the food supply , and started jabbing the people with poisonous vaccines .\nThe \u201c Green Revolution \u201d in Africa was never designed for the benefit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse .\nIn 2018 , the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation paid off Nigeria \u2019 s $ 76 million polio debt , which the country had acquired to combat its national polio epidemic .\nThe Foundation approved the debt write-off after Nigeria met certain conditions , including the guarantee of more than 80 percent polio vaccination coverage in at least one round [ of government-mandated vaccination ] each year in very high-risk areas .\nIn the last decade , Bill Gates is reputed to have funneled an estimated $ 1.6b of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Nigeria , especially immunization of kids against polio with a view to helping to end the \u201c nation \u2019 s shame as the world \u2019 s capital of the horrific yet preventable disease.\n\u201d In 2020 , under the Rona Regime , Nigerian politicians proposed the \u201c Nigeria Centre for Disease Control Bill \u201d to replace the National Quarantine Act of 2004 .\nThis horrible piece of legislation \u2013 under the New World Order \u2013 is actually a blueprint for what is desired for the entire planet .\nThe bill strips Nigerians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warrant , and makes non-compliance a crime .\nWhile the Senate had yet to review the Bill for a second time back in 2020 , the House version had already undergone the public hearing phase .\nMeanwhile , the Speaker of the House Of Representatives was accused of plagiarizing\u2013 almost WORD FOR WORD the draconian Singapore Infectious Diseases Act 1977 , which had passed 43 years ago .\nI was unable to find any information past 2020 , online .\nThe Coalition of United Political Parties ( CUPP ) , Nigeria \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human intelligence report , \u201d alleged that Gates offered Nigerian lawmakers $ 10 million for the \u201c speedy passage \u201d of the bill , which ( on the surface ) aimed to curb the spread of infectious diseases .\nGates denied the accusations of any bribes , but for the record , he uses shame and bribery to drive vaccination rates .\nWas the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control Bill a practice run to be used elsewhere in the world ?\nGates writes about the importance of \u201c practice , practice , practice.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chapter Seven of his latest book .\nEverything is an exercise , where they collect data to then turn around and use their playbook on yet another country with yet another virus .\n\u201c The Next One WILL Get Their Attention \u201d Monkeypox was considered a rare disease caused by the monkeypox virus ( MPXV ) .\nIt was reportedly \u201c discovered \u201d in 1958 when outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research in a Rockefeller Foundation-funded lab in Copenhagen .\nBy the way , the Rockefeller Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote about back in 2016 .\nAccording to rumors , gain-of-function research started as far back as 1961 in both the US and abroad to explore cross-transmissibility after scientists discovered that it could be transmitted via rodents .\nWhile I was unable to find anything to this effect , rodents are suspected of somehow playing a role in transmission .\nLittle is known about rodent reservoir genomic diversity .\nThe first human case of monkeypox was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) , and since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a number of central and western African countries .\nSee The Tenpenny Report for a monkeypox timeline .\n\u201c The next one will get their attention.\n\u201d Do you remember when Billy Boy said this with his sideways creepy grin ?\nThat \u2019 s the quote I thought of after reviewing ghastly pictures of monkeypox on genitals in The British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) published in July 2022 .\nThese were not re-hashed National Geographic-esque images of African children with pustules that the mainstream usually circulates .\nThe 1980s All Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s the 1980s all over again , \u201d James Grundvig of American Media Periscope recently told me .\n\u201c Promiscuous youth are getting high , cavorting and then infecting one other.\n\u201d The first peer-reviewed study showed monkeypox is primarily transmitted through the sexual activity of gay and bisexual men with 41 percent also having HIV .\nWas there more going on here than gay orgies and COVID-19 jab side effects ?\nI am still working it out ; remember that I am not a scientist \u2013 I am an investigative reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallpox , whittled down immune systems from jabs , and a bioweapon are very much involved .\nAnd while many are dismissing monkeypox as a \u201c gay disease , \u201d the CDC wants you to believe that \u201c anyone can get it.\n\u201d On May 19th , Jo\u00e3o Paulo Gomes , Ph.D. , a researcher from the department of infectious diseases , and Dr. Doutor Ricardo Jorge of the Instituto Nacional de Sa\u00fade ( INSA ) in Lisbon , Portugal , posted the first draft genome sequence online on virological.org .\n\u201c The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus causing these infections will certainly contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiology , sources of infection , and transmission patterns , \u201d wrote the authors .\nEchoing this point , Illumina CEO Francis deSouza told the press that sequencing the monkeypox virus is vital to developing vaccines , therapeutics , and diagnostics .\nDeSouza added we need to widen global surveillance not only for supposed public health but for national defense \u201c to monitor bioterrorist attacks that may be playing out.\n\u201d Naturally , Illumina involves all the usual suspects \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Vanguard Group , and Blackrock .\nLike what you \u2019 re reading on The Tenpenny Report ?\nShare this

research into the monkeypox virus ( MPXV ) , I didn \u2019 t need to go far to find the mad sweater-wearing ghoul .\nOn July 29th , on the heels of the World Hoax Organization ( WHO ) announcing monkeypox as the next \u201c plandemic , \u201d National Public Radio ( NPR ) put out a story that received little fanfare or coverage .\nI wondered why NPR would even publish such a story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cares about the truth .\nMoreover , NPR had accepted tons of money from the Gates Foundation in the past .\nWas the article a confession to cover their behinds with the assumption that no one would connect the dots ?\nI also wondered exactly what meddlings Gates had had in Nigeria .\nSure enough , the country sold its soul to the devil .\nBefore I share my findings \u2013 first an update on monkeypox ( I imagine WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus saying this out loud with his heavy Ethiopian accent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his expert panel , Tedros made a unilateral decision against a majority vote and declared monkeypox \u201c an emergency and a public health emergency of international concern \u201d ( PHEIC ) .\nIf you visit the MonkeyPox Meter , supposedly the cases worldwide have gone from zero to 22,000+ in as little as three months , including more than 4,000 cases in the US .\nFive days after Tedros \u2019 announcement , the Mayor of San Francisco declared a \u201c state of emergency \u201d due to monkeypox .\nIncidentally , Shit Francisco is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and transgender populations who are supposedly at high risk of monkeypox ( if that \u2019 s true , perhaps they are being targeted , just like in the days of AIDS . )\nThe city already has a waitlist for when a monkeypox vaccine becomes available .\nMany have reported that announcing monkeypox is really a cover-up for the damage done from the COVID jabs on the immune system , similar to what we \u2019 ve seen as shingles , autoimmune blistering disease , and herpes infections .\nIncidentally , when I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , Twitter threw me in jail .\nLater , I learned it was tied to Tedros \u2019 invitation to social media platforms to work with the WHO to counter \u201c monkeypox disinformation.\n\u201d What about that monkeypox jab ?\nEvery country that has reported alleged cases of monkeypox since May 2022 , where it was not already endemic , is also a country that has distributed the Pfizer COVID-19 injection .\n\u201c Monkeypox could very well be a herpes infection that is jab induced , in fact , that \u2019 s likely\u2026 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to find a paper trail or some smoking gun that confirms this and instead will continue to have to rely on circumstantial and anecdotal evidence , \u201d says Sofia K , a scientist who is part of a medical freedom group I belong to .\n\u201c Unfortunately , or fortunately ; depending on whether you chose to get the COVID-19 injection , official government data and confidential Pfizer documents strongly suggest the COVID-19 injection may be reactivating the dormant chickenpox virus or herpes virus due to the frightening damage it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Expose-News .\nCase in point : the CDC even updated the monkeypox case definition to include varicella & herpes zoster rashes !\n!\nAdditionally , post MRNA jab , more latent viruses are rearing their ugly head .\nHerpes viruses ( like many ) are opportunistic infections that store in the nerve ganglia and can be \u201c reactivated \u201d when your immune system is either busy elsewhere or depressed .\nThere are dots that connect .\n\u201c This means we may not be witnessing a worldwide outbreak of monkeypox at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences of administering an experimental injection to millions of people , \u201d writes Expose-News .\nBut not so fast .\nThere \u2019 s more .\nRemember , the overlords never let a crisis go to waste .\nIn this inverted upside-down world , plandemics serve many purposes , and the truth is multi-layered .\nSo what else is going on ?\nFive years ago , Dr. Dimie Ogoina said he saw the most important patient of his career \u2013 an 11-year-old whose infection would eventually be linked to the largest monkeypox outbreak in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks after diagnosing the young boy , Ogoina \u201c became concerned \u2013 quite concerned.\n\u201d The outbreak in Nigeria began to grow rapidly .\nCases cropped up in counties not just near this one boy , but all over .\n\u201c Suddenly , we were seeing cases appear across the country , \u201d Ogoina said .\nThe boy was the first case of monkeypox in Nigeria in 38 years .\nBut not the last .\nEventually , they figured out that the young boy didn \u2019 t catch the virus from playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but rather from a male relative in his household .\nAnd rather than rashes on their face and extremities , blisters occurred around their genitals .\n\u201c They had very extensive genital lesions .\nVery , very extensive , \u201d Ogoina says .\nTo Dr. Ogoina , clearly , the virus had changed .\nAdditionally , months after accusing the United States of having biological laboratories in Ukraine , Russia revealed that there are at least four US-operated biological laboratories in Nigeria \u2013 in Abuja , Zaria , and Lagos \u2013 from where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u201c hows \u201d are convoluted , they started spreading through sexual contact for the first time five years ago .\nOgoina and his colleagues even mentioned this occurrence in a study published in 2019 : \u201c Although the role of sexual transmission of human monkeypox is not established , sexual transmission is plausible in some of these patients through close , skin-to-skin contact during sexual intercourse or by transmission via genital secretions , \u201d Ogoina and his colleagues wrote in the journal PLOS One .\n\u201c Yes , someone told me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , \u201d Ogoina recalls with exasperation in his voice .\n\u201c I was told , \u2018 We should not worry about sexual transmission.\n\u2019 \u201c Who told him to stay silent ?\nWas this when monkeypox first started spreading sexually ?\nWas a messed-with gain-of-function monkeypox virus circulating in Nigeria that far back ?\nWhat if whatever was going on was spread via a vaccine ?\nDr. Ogoina didn \u2019 t respond to my email message .\nAt the time of his observation , Nigeria didn \u2019 t have the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had to send our samples to Senegal and even to the US to make a diagnosis , \u201d he says .\n\u201c We had to wait.\n\u201d Not surprisingly , they were instructed to use the unreliable PCR test which ratcheted up cases on demand .\nReports emerged that the NIH and Wuhan Lab had been working on monkeypox prior to the outbreak .\nIn a scientific article in Virologica Sinica , the official journal of the Chinese Society of Microbiology , the authors explained the process for artificially engineering a monkeypox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute of Virology published a study in February 2022 \u2013 months before the outbreak \u2013 in which they described creating a portion of a monkeypox genome from scratch in order to develop a PCR test for

unavailable.\n\u201d What are the risks inherent in creating synthetic viruses ?\nThat aside , the data indicates that , indeed , the monkeypox outbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolutionary biologist Michael Worobey at the University of Arizona , who has been analyzing the statistics .\nInstead , the transmission of the virus went underground in Nigeria for years .\nWhy ?\nWas it because the Medical Cartel told the media not to report on an actual Hegelian ( \u201c Problem-Reaction-Solution \u201d ) purposeful outbreak ?\nEventually , Worobey believes the outbreak spread to other countries and

billion COVID-19 vaccine doses.\n\u201d MEP Terhes added , \u201c That means that she ( von der Leyen ) bought ten doses of vaccines for every EU citizen , based on contracts that were never released to the public.\n\u201d Two doses plus up to eight boosters : most people would never survive the repeated decimation of their immune systems due to this many Covid boosters .\nPeople have died and fell incapacitated after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single booster , and a fourth shot .\nFrom all of the global data on the experimental bioweapon , it \u2019 s hard to imagine the vaccinated getting a seventh or eighth shot , let alone ten .\nThey physically wouldn \u2019 t endure such a regimen .\nJust ask the dead virtue-signaling , 63-year-old bodybuilder who died recently after just two doses .\nHis muscles might have been strong , his physique tone and cut , but his immune system collapsed , and he paid the ultimate price .\nWarning : Think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the reality of cratering demand , Switzerland will now destroy 10 million doses of Moderna \u2019 s Covid vaccines .\nMany more countries will follow suit .\nSo , how many of the 4.6 billion doses of the European Covid shots were manufactured ?\nIn October 2016 , I attended the first two-day ACIP meeting at the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) headquarters in Druid Hills , Georgia .\nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) is a board of academic and pharmaceutical \u201c experts \u201d who meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October , and vote on the latest changes to vaccine policy , wording for package inserts , and more .\nAt the 2016 \u201c s\u00e9ance \u201d committee meeting , I recall approximately twenty advisory board members voted on twenty vaccine-related topics , changes , and recommendations .\nWhen the day concluded , 400 votes were cast\u2014399 yay , one recusal .\nThe landslide voting by the ACIP members reminded me of some of sports \u2019 most memorable lopsided victories .\nA total rout .\nFrom their clear pay-to-play bias , with little meaningful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the semi-annual ACIP meeting as a s\u00e9ance \u2014 witchcraft for a druid ceremony on child predation and child sacrifice , executed with the stealth bioweapon of vaccines .\nThe 2022 first day vote at the ACIP s\u00e9ance was a no-brainer .\nOn my show , \u201c Unrestricted Truths \u201d ( Episode 205 ) , \u201c Medical Fraudemic with Dr. Meryl Nass , \u201d I confidently declared that : A ) ACIP members would indeed vote on the Covid clot shots for babies and children ; B ) They would do so unanimously .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet .\nBut then I know the CDC \u2019 s druid priests , who do not have the best interests in our health as they continue child sacrifice practices deep into the 21st century .\nSure enough , the advisory committee voted 15-0 to approve the Covid vaccines for babies and children ; the ACIP members voted 15-0 to put the clot shots on the childhood immunization schedule .\nThey did so , despite the Covid vaccines causing death , myocarditis , huge increases in cancers , and dozens of other adverse events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the CDC \u2019 s own data showing that babies , toddlers , and children are at ZERO risk of dying from Covid .\nIt \u2019 s like any childhood flu or sniffle , said the backtracking CEO of Moderna , who is in cover-his-ass mode since the European Parliament vaccine earthquake last week .\nThe reality of the rigged and fraudulent voting by committee with the Covid Death Cult \u2019 s ( CDC ) ACIP panel can be found in its own 39-slide presentation deck , from which the 15 members cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ACIP \u201c COVID-19 Vaccines for Children \u201d exposes their fraudulent pitch and data .\nI marked up the slide , while providing a link to the FDA \u2019 s approval on Covid clot shots for children last year ( 10-29-2021 ) .\nThe two align as the only mass causation for the spike in child hospitalizations\u2013not due to some limp variant , but from the Covid vaccine bioweapons themselves .\nIn typical CDC storytelling , which is most often fiction , the marketing arm of Big Pharma either inflates or deflates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong signal for causation .\nIn the early 2000s , the CDC concocted schemes including hiring a rogue Danish scientist , who would be indicted for 22 counts of banking and wire fraud , to criminally erase the autism-vaccine epidemic signal .\nThe CDC did the same disappearing wand act again when it generated more fake data in an epidemiology study on vaccine-injured children in Atlanta public schools\u2013the domestic fraud that turned into the movie \u201c Vaxxed.\n\u201d The song remains the same on Slide No .\n11 , in which I marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false or blatant lies .\nYou decide .\nMy colleague from a vaccine risk awareness group , Linda Englander , RN , noted on the following slides : \u201c Why aren \u2019 t they showing the myocarditis rate after the first dose ?\nWhy aren \u2019 t they showing how many stop vaccinating after one dose ?\nThese are \u2018 verified \u2019 cases .\nHow many cases are unverified and the children die suddenly and unexpectedly or suffer in silence and become disabled ?\n\u201d [ Emphasis ours ] She continued : \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , what is a covid \u2018 associated \u2019 hospitalization ?\n\u201d Also , bothering RN Englander were these additional observations : On slide 13 : \u201c Again , only reporting on dose two and the first booster , only verified cases , with no estimate or mention of unverified cases and only in the first seven ( 7 ) days .\nSo cases diagnosed after seven ( 7 ) days are not counted.\n\u201d [ Emphasis ours ] \u201c Calling these cardiac injuries myocarditis is not correct , since the heart condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not typical myocarditis , but more closely resembles catecholamine-mediated stress ( toxic ) cardiomyopathy.\n\u201d She referenced a 2021 study , published on the NIH website , \u201c Autopsy Histopathologic Cardiac Findings in 2 Adolescents Following the Second COVID-19 Vaccine Dose , \u201d James R. Gill , et al .\n\u201c The myocardial injury seen in these post-vaccine hearts is different from typical myocarditis and has an appearance most closely resembling a catecholamine-mediated stress ( toxic ) cardiomyopathy .\nUnderstanding that these instances are different from typical myocarditis and that cytokine storm has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help guide screening and therapy.\n\u201d Slide No .\n14 above shows how the CDC inflates numbers .\nReports have come back that ~2 % of babies to 4-year-old toddlers have taken the shot\u2013since most parents nearly three years into the COVID-19 fraud are waking up to the dangers of the sterilizing Coffin-19 jab .\nSo , where did the CDC pull the juiced number of \u201c 1.4 million doses administered , 6.9 % of children in this age group \u201d from ?\nThe moon ?\nIf you are out for \u201c legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost their children to the Covid vaccines , Slide No .\n29 contains a list of names I would include on any lawsuit .\nThese vaccine \u201c experts \u201d form the ACIP Vaccine Policy Team .\nIf I am one of those parents who lost a loved one under the age of 17 , I would send this slide to your lawyer .\nIf you want to email the 15 ACIP members who hate America \u2019 s children , but love shielding Big Pharma \u2019 s criminality , here are their addresses .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ t harass them .\nBut do put them on notice .\nAnd if you lost a child due to the Covid bioweapon , you might tell them that your lawyer looks forward to \u201c serving you.\n\u201d And here are the 15 ACIP members \u2019 email addresses .\nAs I said on last night \u2019 s show ( Episode 206 ) \u201c C19 Mind Virus with Dr. Lee Merritt , \u201d the CDC will be the number one sales team for the skyrocketing growth in home schooling trend in 2023 .\nI stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt \u2019 s time for freedom-loving Americans to rise up against the medical tyranny that aims to harm us , confiscate our God-given freedom of choice , and would prefer to put its jackboot on our throats to silence us .\nBut We the People are not going to allow the fascists to do that .\nRemember , they lost their first-mover advantage in 2020 when their lies and fabrications were unmasked by Dr. Deborah Birx and see-through pantomime .\nThey lied to us about mask-wearing , social distancing , isolation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how the virus transmits and how it dies under UV light , viral loads , vaccines are the only way , and that the bioweapon would prevent transmission .\nDon \u2019 t forget , midstream through the shamdemic , they changed the definition of \u2018 vaccine.\n\u2019 All lies were made up as they \u201c went along , \u201d according to Dr. Deborah Birx \u2019 s own July testimony \u2014 while Dr. Robert Redfield tossed Anthony Fauci under the Covid jab bus .\nAs a result of the European Parliament discovery last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies ceded all control , authority , and credibility when the last nail in the Covid vaccine coffin hammered

panel of academic and pharmaceutical \u201c experts \u201d known as the CDC \u2019 s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) voted unanimously on October 20 to add these death jabs to the children \u2019 s immunization schedule .\nJournalist James Grundvig outlines the horrific play-by-play of this committee in his excellent article Child Sacrifice via the Covid Death Cult ( CDC ) Advisory Committee .\nIn children , COVID-19 is mild and easily treated .\nAccording to Dr. Peter McCullough , these jabs are neither clinically indicated nor medically necessary .\nStill , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Moderna and Novavax to the 2023 immunization schedule for ages 18 and under .\nThere are many , many issues with these so-called vaccines .\nCDC released its own VAERS data just eight days after this decision ; as of October 28 , there have been over 5,000 adverse events and 45 deaths just after the booster updates .\nIn total , VAERS is showing nearly 1.5 million adverse events reports from all age groups since the COVID shots were first made available to the public .\nApproximately 260,000 are serious injuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMcCullough correctly states we \u201c don \u2019 t have any assurances that these are going to be safe over the short or even longer term.\n\u201d So what gives ?\nHow can 15 experts know about data like the VAERS reports , yet unanimously approve of giving these injurious experimental mRNA injections to mere children ?\nCould one reason for this 15-0 compliance be that Moderna , Pfizer and CDC are all in \u2018 bed \u2019 together , figuratively speaking ?\nJournalist Sharyl Attkisson seems to think so .\nIn her excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually supplied offices to both Moderna and Pfizer , where all three shared a public relations ( PR ) firm .\nDoes it get ANY cozier ?\nAttkisson cites research by Paul D. Thacker regarding Weber Shandwick , the world \u2019 s second largest PR firm .\nThis is a blatant case of undue influence .\nDespite knowing that Weber Shandwick counted both Pfizer and Moderna as private sector clients , the CDC still issued a PR contract to the firm .\nThis means that the same talking points for the CDC are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works for the vaccine manufacturers .\nOh , and by the way , Weber Shandwick also has Sanofi and Glaxo Smith Kline vaccine makers as clients , too .\nThis is a colossal conflict of interest .\nHuge .\nIt begs the question : how involved is Weber Shandwick in formulating public vaccination policy , and how influenced are they by their private well-paying clients to shape that policy in favor of Pfizer and Moderna ?\nInterestingly , Weber employees have cited their duties , via their social media , as \u201c boosting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other diseases .\nIndeed .\nThe CDC first awarded Weber Shandwick a $ 50 million contract in September 2020 .\nIt appears the answer is a resounding \u2018 no \u2019 .\nDespite CDC officials being notified that their data was wrong regarding COVID-19 child deaths , the CDC ignored the data and never issued any corrections .\nEpoch Times has the full story here , but suffice to say that CDC used a non-peer reviewed single study as the primary source of whether to recommend the COVID-19 jabs for babies and toddlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleming-Dutra and Sara Oliver , were told that the statistics from a study preprint were wrong .\nIn typical government bureaucracy fashion , the CDC discussed the matter .\nIn fact , emails obtained by the Epoch Times showed CDC actually discussed the issue fairly extensively .\nInstead the ACIP committee ramrodded through the authorization of Pfizer and Moderna shots for children as young as 6 months of age .\nIn true form , the CDC quickly accepted the recommendation .\nThis isn \u2019 t the first time the CDC has swept a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDC Director Rochelle Walensky actually admitted that her agency wasn \u2019 t exactly performing stellar safety monitoring in 2021 .\nThe full story is here , but suffice to say that the CDC \u201c forgot \u201d to analyze certain adverse event reports .\nThey didn \u2019 t start with the data analysis until 2022 , but stated that it went on in 2021 .\nWalensky actually is aware that her agency gave this false information .\nShe said as much in a letter but offered no explanation of why this falsehood happened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the future .\nIt also appears that the CDC delayed reporting of myocarditis .\nYou can read the whole paper here , but suffice to say that the CDC delayed its reporting of jab-related myocarditis by at least three months after the first significant VAERS reports rolled in .\nKeep in mind that VAERS is CDC \u2019 s responsibility .\nThe authors state that CDC \u2019 s actions ( or lack thereof ) meant that 120 million Americans were in the dark , and proceeded with one or more doses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk that had started to unfurl .\nMyocarditis is sadly a word we now know all too well .\nWhat is going on at the CDC ?\nThese glaring examples pretty much answer that question

we explored the dangers of the spike protein .\nHere we explore the mRNA .\nThe CoV injections are considered gene therapy whether they are DNA or mRNA-based treatments .\nRecall that Stefan Oelrich , president of Bayer \u2019 s Pharmaceuticals Division , said that the mRNA shots are \u2018 gene therapy , \u2019 which were marketed as \u2018 vaccines \u2019 to gain public trust .\n\u201c mRNA is short for one type of RNA existing in our cells , called messenger RNA .\nRNA is material carrying a set of instructions for the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those instructions.\n\u201d The technology is described in a paid article on CNBC , an advertorial , as a \u201c groundbreaking biotechnology some 30 years in the making.\n\u201d To note , large profits are expected to be made from CoV gene therapy injections : \u201c Pfizer expects to make three billion shots in 2021 , enough for two doses for 1.5 billion people .\nIt will make $ 26 billion in vaccine sales in 2021 , which would make it the biggest-selling medicine ever.\n\u201d To be clear , when the mRNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SARS-CoV-2 virus , scientists created a synthetic mRNA sequence , modified from the wild-type viral sequence .\nThis was in order to make it more difficult for the body to break down the mRNA and it means it \u2019 s not natural .\nBut in the inverted world of Pharmaceia , aka sorcery that is Rockefeller medicine , the immune system is ill-equipped and needs this experimental jab .\nAccording to Dr. Michael Palmer , MD , and Sucharit Bhakdi , MD .\n\u201c The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines consist of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encodes the SARS-CoV-2 \u201c spike protein , which normally is found on the surface of the [ SARS-CoV-2 ] coronavirus particles.\n\u201d Case in point , take this passage from the CNBC advertorial paid for by Pfizer : \u201c Similarly , if a person is exposed to the virus , the body \u2019 s immune system will also recognize it and respond .\nOne important difference is that the vaccine does not cause disease.\n\u201d \u201c The vaccine does not cause disease ?\n\u201d That is a BLATANT LIE .\nThe vaccine definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus , yet it was sold with the promise that it will save you from death .\nAnother lie .\nThe adverse reactions and \u2018 breakthrough \u2019 infection rate would suggest that is not true \u2013 Pfizer \u2019 s clinical trial data also shows that prevention of disease is only a goal , not the reality of the CoV gene treatments .\n\u201c The vaccines are not only being celebrated as a first for mRNA technology , but also a milestone for the nanoparticle field.\n\u201d The mRNA is protected by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter a cell membrane where the mRNA will then be used as a pattern for the cell to replicate the modified spike protein .\nIt is then placed on the cell surface where immune cells will see it and form antibodies against it .\nThe antibodies will be either neutralizing ones that will be protective against infection ( but a risk to the cell itself and any others that have added the modified spike protein to their surface ) or non-neutralizing ones that would not protect against infection ( but also would cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person \u2019 s cells that have had spike added to their surface ) .\nThe mRNA strands are large and negatively charged and can \u2019 t simply waltz across the protective lipid membranes of cells .\nInstead , free mRNA in the body would be quickly broken down by the person \u2019 s immune cells .\nPrior to LNPs , this is what made lab experiments difficult and the delivery of mRNA to our cells impossible .\nWithout these synthetic lipids , enzymes in the environment and in our bodies would be \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c LNP development has been a headache , but without this packaging , mRNA vaccines would be nothing .\n\u201c It is the unsung hero of the whole thing , \u201d says Giuseppe Ciaramella , who was head of infectious diseases at Moderna from 2014 to 2018.\n\u201d The issue with nanoparticles as a \u2018 treatment \u2019 is the body \u2019 s immune cells are designed to identify and remove larger particles .\nNanoparticles can escape our defense system .\nThe mRNA gene sequence is coated in a membrane made of a mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lipid Nanoparticles or LNPs .\nOne type can have a neutral charge in the bloodstream and a positive charge once in a cell \u2019 s interior \u2013 an ionizable cationic lipid .\n\u201c The ionizable cationic lipid is the linchpin of a nanoparticle.\n\u201d The pegylated lipids include graphene oxide which is very stable and the body \u2019 s enzymes can not break it down .\nThe pegylated lipid is used in other products and has been known to cause allergic reactions .\nFor purposes of the CoV injections , it is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them more stable , and less likely to be broken down before entering a cell .\n\u201c LNPs used in the [ Pfizer ] COVID-19 vaccines contain four ingredients [ Moderna includes 3 types ] : \u2022 ionizable lipids whose positive charges bind to the negatively charged backbone of mRNA , [ and help it enter cell or mitochondria membranes , ALC-0315 ] , \u2022 pegylated lipids that help stabilize the particle [ this is the synthetic lipid that includes graphene oxide \u2022 and phospholipids [ non-synthetic but may add to a risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the person \u2019 s white blood cells ] \u2022 and cholesterol molecules [ non-synthetic ] that contribute to the particle \u2019 s structure.\n\u201d The membrane coating protects the mRNA once it is in the body as it normally would be broken down quickly if found outside of a cell .\nThe NLP carrier membrane lipids also help the mRNA enter the human cells because one lipid can have a positive charge ( cationic ) which helps open the cell membrane : \u201c ionizable lipids that are positively charged at an acidic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ionizable synthetic lipid ALC-0315 used in the Pfizer LNPs , was first described in a patent application by Acuitas Therapeutics in 2017 .\n\u201c There are no cationic lipids in nature , \u2019 \u201d remarks University of British Columbia nanoparticle scientist Pieter Cullis .\n\u201c \u2018 And we knew we couldn \u2019 t use permanently positively charged lipids because they are so damn toxic.\n\u2019 \u201d \u201c Positively charged lipids are inherently toxic , and companies struggled for years before landing on formulations that were safe and effective .\nWhen injected intravenously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liver , and delivery to other organs is still an obstacle.\n\u201d These newfangled fake \u201c modern \u201d LNPs can be traced back to work on simpler systems called liposomes , hollow lipid spheres often made of just two or three kinds of lipids .\nThese synthetic , fake , and unnatural lipids have never been injected into human beings before .\nReported cell damage is due to chemical toxicity , mediated most likely by the cationic ( positively charged ion ) lipid components of the LNPs .\nAccording to Dr. Peter McCullough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggesting the lipid nanoparticles actually go right into the heart.\n\u201d The mRNA actually binds to ribosomes\u2014the cell \u2019 s little protein factories\u2014and induces the synthesis of the actual spike protein molecules .\nMost of the spike protein molecules will then be transported to the cell surface .\nThousands of these four components encapsulate the mRNA , shield it from \u201c destructive \u201d enzymes ( which are really just doing their job ) , and shuttle it into cells or mitochondria , where the mRNA is unloaded and used to make proteins .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains hundreds of small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) molecules , each surrounded by ionizable lipids , phospholipids , and cholesterol .\nThe outside of the particle is coated in pegylated lipids .\nLNPs for messenger RNA ( mRNA ) is made with similar ingredients but contain only a few mRNA strands.\n\u201d \u201c Although the concept seems simple , perfecting it [ LNPs ] was far from straightforward.\n\u201d An excerpt from a paper , published on April 30 , 2021 , by Palmer and Bhakdi , in the journal Circulation Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vascular disease , demonstrating exactly how the SARS-CoV-2 virus damages and attacks the vascular system on a cellular level .\n\u201c After the vaccine has entered a cell , it initially finds itself enclosed by a membrane vesicle\u2014a little bubble that was pinched off from the cell membrane .\nThe subsequent accumulation of acid inside this bubble causes the lipids to be stripped off , and the mRNA to be released into the cytosol ( the intracellular fluid ) ; this release step is facilitated by the cationic lipid ALC-0315 ( see @ @

Neurology International asked the same question .\nThe article is entitled COVID UPDATE : What is the truth ?\nTelegram users recently ran across this article and started a conversation .\nDespite being published several months ago , the author \u2019 s message is timeless .\nThis particular article is jaw-dropping from the perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful article , all that has been wrong about the COVID-19 pandemic , described by author Dr. Russell Blaylock as \u201c the most manipulated infectious disease event in history.\n\u201d Blaylock describes the unending lies from government agencies and medical authorities , and notes that for the first time in American history , bureaucrats are determining medical treatments to force conformance to specific treatment modalities , including untested experimental injections , use of respirators , and use of unproven and problematic treatments like remdesivir .\nBureaucracies like the CDC and WHO are calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates , who not only have never treated a single patient ( Gates doesn \u2019 t even have a medical background ) , but who both clearly are experiencing tremendous financial gain from these jabs .\nThese agencies indoctrinated the world with draconian measures like lockdowns , masks and social distancing .\nWe couldn \u2019 t visit sick loved ones in the hospital , oftentimes forcing them to face death alone and afraid .\nBlaylock explains that the \u201c CDC has no authority to dictate to hospitals or doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nMost physicians complied without even batting an eye : \u201c For the first time in modern medical history , early medical treatment of these infected patients was ignored nationwide.\n\u201d Or maybe the price of non-compliance was simply too high .\nIf you are a physician , nurse or other qualified healthcare practitioner , and dare to speak the truth , you are attacked and your medical career destroyed \u2013 all because you refuse to participate in killing patients .\nSo many others , including Dr. Tenpenny , have been the victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentions Dr. Peter McCullough , one of the most cited experts in his field , who has successfully treated over 2,000 COVID patients with an early treatment protocol , as suffering particularly vicious assaults both professionally and personally \u2013 just for talking about he has treated his patients .\nBut it doesn \u2019 t match up with the mainstream , and therein lies the problem .\nPhysicians who dare to prescribe ivermectin are being stripped of their medical licenses and ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation .\nThey are also being removed as editors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t fall in line are being scrutinized and put into an endless loop of edits so that their publication never sees the light of day .\nThere are many other similar purgings being done to ensure one and only one narrative \u2013 one that never questions these mRNA jabs .\nMany hospital administrators were simply unable to stop salivating over incentive payments for putting patients in the ICU or on respirators .\nThe money was just too tempting , including the grant money from the NIH and additional incentives from \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the media is complicit .\nIn fact , they are more than complicit , as the author says , given that they have positioned themselves as the sole source of pandemic information .\nAfter all , why wouldn \u2019 t they take this position ?\nThe media is beholden to the pharmaceutical giants or other wealthy and powerful people who are benefiting financially and otherwise from this debacle called a \u201c pandemic \u201d .\nBig tech has helped by censoring , discrediting and demonizing good doctors and other professionals who have experienced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangers of these experimental injections .\nAll of this amounts to \u201c unprecedented intrusions into medical practice \u201d , as Blaylock so aptly describes as \u201c reminiscent of the methodology of the Soviet KGB during the period when dissidents were incarcerated in psychiatric gulags to silence their dissent .\nHe is so right .\nBut more than intrusions , the damage done

join into a multi-nucleated mass of cells \u2013 leading to a risk for blood clots .\nThe syncytial clusters may also be a factor in the loss of white blood cells and a lower lymphocyte count .\nThe vaccine spike protein and its interactions with the human immune system can also produce health issues .\nPfizer \u2019 s own animal data clearly presaged the following risks and dangers : \u2022 blood clotting shortly after vaccination , potentially leading to heart attacks , stroke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinical trials did not monitor any laboratory parameters that could have provided information on these risks , such as those related to blood coagulation ( e.g .\nD-dimer level ( 31 ) /thrombocytes ) , muscle cell damage ( e.g .\ntroponin/creatine kinase ) , or liver damage ( e.g .\n?\n-glutamyltransferase ) .\nThat the various regulatory agencies granted emergency use authorization based on such incomplete and insufficient data amounts is criminal .\nIn truth , we are the lab

ve never witnessed so many vaccine-related injuries.\n\u201d ( 32 ) Historically , as far back as 2014 , other vaccinations have also been documented to cause bleeding syndromes .\nOn the topic of abnormal blood clotting , both the COVID-19 vaccine and the COVID-19 infection have been documented to provoke increased blood clotting [ thrombosis ] .\nMeanwhile , \u201c Americans who received a @

Levy , MD , JD states in Resolving \u201c Long-Haul COVID \u201d and Vaccine Toxicity , Orthomolecular.org , ( 11 ) , have been found to cause coagulopathies resulting in abnormal blood-clotting .\nCritically ill COVID-19 ICU patients demonstrated elevated D-dimer levels roughly 60 % of the time .\nAn elevated D-dimer test result is almost an absolute confirmation of abnormal blood clotting taking place somewhere in the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the capillary level , or much larger , even involving the thrombosis of large blood vessels .\nHigher D-dimer levels that persist in COVID-19 patients appear to directly correlate with significantly increased morbidity and mortality .\nPlatelets , the elements of the blood that can get sticky and both initiate and help grow the size of blood clots , will generally demonstrate declining levels in the blood at the same time D-dimer levels are increasing since their stores are being actively depleted .\nBleeding risks can then become a problem elsewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count prevents normal repair needed to stop minor tissue damage from worsening .\nA post-vaccination syndrome known as vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia ( VIPIT ) ( 40 ) with these very findings has been described by several researchers .\n( 41 ) Persistent evidence of blood clotting ( increased D-dimer levels ) in chronic COVID-19 patients might be a reliable way to determine the persistent presence/production of the COVID-19 spike protein .\n( 42 ) \u201c Clotting pathologies in both acute COVID-19 infection and in Long COVID/PASC might benefit from following a regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibrinolytic system function.\n\u201d ( 42 ) Another way , discussed below , might be dark field microscopy to look for Rouleaux formation of the red blood cells ( RBCs ) .\nUnder conditions of inflammation and systemically increased oxidative stress and fibrinogen levels , RBCs can aggregate to varying degrees , sometimes sticking together like stacks of coins with branching of the stacks seen when the clustering is maximal .\nThis can occur quickly whenever a certain concentration of excess particles ( \u201c depletants \u201d ) are present , ( 45 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis is known as rouleaux formation of the RBCs and can lead to blood clots and stroke or heart attack risk .\n( 44 ) Image of rouleaux stacking of red blood cells , page 7 : ( 44a ) Fibrinolytics would help reduce the risk by removing excess fibrinogen , and trace mineral supplements may help .\nLow trace mineral levels have also

rouleau effect seen in the blood after a CoV injection .\nAt ~ 3:50- 4:30 , low oxygen levels are mentioned as a result of the dysfunctional stacked and clotted red blood cells .\nHe is concerned that it would endanger a developing fetus and cause brain damage in the infant or lead to the death of the fetus and a miscarriage for the CoV injected pregnant woman .\n( 46 ) The correlation between an increased D-dimer level and Rouleaux formation of the RBCs remains to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both should trigger the greatest of concerns for the development of significant chronic COVID-19 and post-COVID vaccination complications .\nIn platelets taken from COVID-19 patients , platelet stickiness predisposing to thrombosis has been shown to result from spike protein binding to ACE2 receptors on the platelets .\nOf note , a D-dimer test that is elevated due to increased blood clotting will usually only stay elevated for a few days after the underlying pathology provoking the blood clotting has been resolved .\nChronic or \u201c long-haul \u201d COVID-19 infections often demonstrate persistent evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study , 25 % of convalescent COVID-19 patients who were four months past their acute infections demonstrated increased D-dimer levels .\nInterestingly , these D-dimer elevations were often present when the other common laboratory parameters of abnormal blood clotting had returned to normal .\nThese other tests included prothrombin time , partial thromboplastin time , fibrinogen level , and platelet count .\nInflammation parameters , including C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 , typically also had returned to normal .\nIn November 2021 , the WSJ even reported that researchers investigating heart-related risks linked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories , including one centered on the spike protein made in response to vaccination .\nAnother way to look at health and disease is through the lens of metabolomics , the study of metabolites , very small molecules produced by chemical reactions in our cells .\nThe tiny microscopic \u201c machines \u201d transacting these chemical reactions are enzymes .\nWhen a metabolic pathway does not function , the flow of chemical reactions is hindered and homeostasis is compromised .\nThe metabolic disorder is analogous to the degree of enzyme dysfunction , which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the corresponding co-factors ( vitamin , mineral , amino acid ) .\nSo you can experience dis-ease if you are not getting the needed nutrients or micronutrients and are not able to absorb them , coupled with multiple chemical exposures that create a chemical body burden .\nAccording to Dr. Thomas E. Levy , MD , JD , all toxins ultimately inflict their damage by directly oxidizing biomolecules , or by indirectly resulting in the oxidation of those biomolecules ( proteins , sugars , fats , enzymes , etc. )\n.\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) they can no longer perform their normal chemical or metabolic functions .\nNo toxin can cause any clinical toxicity unless biomolecules end up becoming oxidized .\nThe unique array of biomolecules that become oxidized determines the nature of the clinical condition resulting from given toxin exposure .\nThere is no \u201c disease \u201d present in a cell involved in a given medical condition beyond the distribution and degree of biomolecules that are oxidized .\nRather than \u201c causing \u201d disease , the state of oxidation in a grouping of biomolecules IS the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to oxidized biomolecules ( reduction ) , the normal function of these biomolecules is restored .\nUnfortunately , an onslaught of toxins can make healing a challenge .\nMeanwhile , as Mike Adams reports \u201c Injecting any substance into the human body makes its order of magnitude more potentially toxic because it bypasses the protections of the digestive tract or the respiratory system .\nInjecting mercury into a human being \u2014 at any dose \u2014 should be globally condemned as a criminal act .\nThat it is currently considered an acceptable act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemns the true destructive nature of modern medicine .\nUnder the vaccine doctrine , \u201c First do no harm \u201d has become \u201c Poison for profit.\n\u201c While we will not go into all the toxic ingredients , partially because they haven \u2019 t all been disclosed , let \u2019 s look at some main ones .\nLike what you \u2019 re reading on The Tenpenny Report ?\nShare this article with your friends .\nHelp us grow .\nMaryam Henein is an investigative journalist , and founder , and editor-in-chief of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also a functional medicine consultant/coach , and the director of the award-winning documentary film Vanishing of the Bees , narrated by Elliot Page .\nFollow her on Gab : @ ladybee .\nEmail her : maryam @ honeycolony.com .", "author": "Maryam Henein", "url": "https://vaxxter.com/part-7-a-primer-understanding-the-mechanisms-of-the-covid-19-vaccines/", "published": "Wed, 30 Nov 2022 17:05:31 +0000", "published_utc": 1669845931, "collection_utc": 1669898857}, {"id": "vaxxter--2022-12-02--It\u2019s Time For Nuremberg 2.0", "date": "2022-12-02", "source": "vaxxter", "title": "It\u2019s Time For Nuremberg 2.0", "content": "Was a Malaysian doctor put to death for administering the COVID jabs ?\nState of the Nation and several other alternative news outlets are reporting this .\nIf it is true , it sets a huge precedent for the world .\nThese jabs are a bioweapon , and this doctor \u2019 s purported death should serve as a stern warning to anyone who has anything to do with administering these jabs : stop what you are doing .\nNow .\nThis health horror show can not continue .\nIs this Malaysian trial just the start of a Nuremberg tsunami ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Nuremberg trials were held in an international court in Nuremberg , Germany in November 1945 to try cases against 24 surviving Nazis captured after the war , including Rudolph Hess , the overseer of the Auschwitz death camp , and Hermann Goering , Hitler \u2019 s second in command .\nOn November 20 , 1945 , some of the most important trials of the 20th century began in Nuremberg , Germany .\nThe trials were a shock to the world when they exposed the terrifying depths of Nazi criminality .\nHalf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the others received long or lifetime prison sentences .\nThese trials were international military tribunals established to provide a uniform legal way to prosecute these war criminals and similar offenders .\nWhen the main trials concluded , a group of subsequent Nuremberg trials began , and the first one was known as \u201c the medical case \u201d or the Doctors Trial for 23 German Nazi physicians who conducted experiments on concentration camp prisoners ( without their consent , of course ) .\nThis trial lasted over six months , with 85 testifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chain to K.

.\nCommon commercial products of graphene oxide are in the form of powder , flakes , and solutions , and are brown-yellow in color .\nAfter isolating graphene from crystalline graphite , the European

spin doctors who worship scientism have repositioned graphene as being good for you .\nThat is the name of the game with pharmaceia , which means sorcery in Greek .\nTake , for instance , Patrick Franz , the founder , and chief executive of materials group PlanarTECH .\nHe sees graphene as a potentially useful tool in the fight against Coronavirus .\n\u201c Franz says research papers written in China over the last four years identified graphene oxide as a potentially effective anti-viral agent.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion is that graphene oxide may offer a platform to fight a variety of viral infections ( such as the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus ) , possibly in the form of a coating.\n\u201d However , when this toxic substance gets into the human body , it can create thromboses , causes blood clots , disrupts the immune system , can trigger a cytokine storm , can instigate pneumonia , create a metallic taste in the mouth , causes inflammation of the mucous membranes , produces a loss in the sense of taste and smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injection site ) , and blocks detoxification in the body by blocking glutathione .\nInteresting that many of the symptoms seem to mirror that of COVID-19 .\nDosage tests on graphene oxide and its effects on human cells were conducted .\nSpecifically , to see how much graphene oxide they can put in a human body before it becomes toxic .\nThe chart of measurement used shows three tiers : an antioxidant reaction , an inflammatory reaction , and a cytotoxicity reaction .\nNow that we \u2019 ve established that graphene oxide is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would inject this toxic \u2018 wonder material \u2019 into the human body .\nFor one , it \u2019 s a great conductor of electricity and it can host a magnetic field .\nCan it be activated by frequencies and literally connect you to the internet of things ?\nIn addition to causing massive increases in oxidative stress , GO alters neural function at the synaptic level , and interacts with magnetic fields and 5G Electromagnetic ( EM ) frequencies .\nThese cause/exacerbate inflammation , confusion , brain fog , sedation , memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graphene oxide is highly conductive and has a direct effect on human neurons .\nIn the future , will humans be controlled from the outside with a magnetic field apparatus ?\nA paper titled Human-Like Sensing and Reflexes of Graphene-Based Films establishes that \u201c high carrier mobility and low sheet resistance ensure graphene a rapid transmission of electrical signals , and thus enable it to be a promising material for its human-like applications.\n\u201d \u201c Humans have numerous senses , wherein vision , hearing , smell , taste , and touch are considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Triggered by light , sound , or other physical simulations , the sensory organs of the human body are excited , leading to the transformation of the afferent energy into neural activity .\nConverting signals into electrical ones , the graphene-based film shows its inherent advantages in responding to tiny stimulations .\n\u201c Various human-like senses of graphene-based film and their recent advancements are then summarized , including light-sensitive devices , acoustic devices , gas sensors , biomolecules , and wearable devices .\nSimilar to the reflex action of humans , the graphene-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiation and light actuation .\nKeep in mind also that the \u201c neurons in the human nervous system have special structures , allowing them to send signals precisely & rapidly to other cells .\nTo utilize the graphene film in human-like sense devices , the promotion of conductivity similar to electrical signal transmission is crucial.\n\u201d \u201c At last , the future opportunities lie in the new applicable human-like senses and the integration of multiple senses that can raise a revolution in bionic devices.\n\u201d They added however that \u201c although the conductivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a promising future , the reality does NOT match the theory due to various factors caused by the defects and cracks from the synthesis and post-treatment process.\n\u201d In understanding the details , there are also nanotech graphene-family nanoparticles , referred to as ( GFNs ) .\nDue to their unique physicochemical properties , graphene-family nanomaterials ( GFNs ) are also widely used in many fields , especially in biomedical applications .\nAccording to a study from 2007 , \u201c Nanoparticles offer many new interesting developments in biomedicine and technology , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functional materials .\nThese particles are small enough to enter almost all areas of the body , including cells and organelles , leading potentially to a new approach to medicine ( NanoMedicine ) .\n\u201d Incidentally , in 2017 , in a study out of Italy , looking at adjuvants , they found that 44 types of 15 traditional vaccines \u2014 manufactured by leading global companies\u2013 contained a very troubling and previously unreported fact : The vaccines were \u201c heavily contaminated with a variety of nanoparticles.\n\u201d GFNs reach various locations through blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , which results in varying degrees of retention in different organs .\nDue to their nanosize , GFNs can reach deeper organs by passing through the normal physiological barriers , such as the blood-air barrier , blood-testis barrier , blood-brain barrier , and blood-placental barrier .\nIn a biological fluid , proteins are associated with nanoparticles , and the amount and presentation of the proteins on the surface of the particles leads to an in vivo response .\nNot surprisingly , several typical mechanisms underlying GFN toxicity have also been revealed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress , DNA damage , inflammatory response , apoptosis , autophagy , and necrosis .\nFor example , some graphene nanomaterial aerosols can be inhaled and substantial deposition in the respiratory tract can occur .\nThey can easily penetrate through the tracheobronchial airways and then transit down to the lower lung airways , resulting in the subsequent formation of granulomas , lung fibrosis , and adverse health effects on exposed persons .\n\u201c In these mechanisms , ( toll-like receptors- ) TLR- , transforming growth factor ?\n- ( TGF- ?\n- ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) dependent-pathways are involved in the signaling pathway network , and oxidative stress plays a crucial role in these pathways.\n\u201d Recall that we mentioned targeting TLR in regards to messing with our innate immune system .\nAs an aside , I found a study that states that \u201c proteins compete for the nanoparticle \u201c surface , \u201d leading to a protein \u201c corona \u201d that largely defines the biological identity of the particle.\n\u201d Is this just a coincidence that the protein is called \u2018 corona \u2019 ?\nYes \u2013 crown-like spikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receptors and other surface proteins on a cell stick out from the surface in order to interact with other chemicals or cells .\nAll cells look studded or sun-like \u2013 corona-shaped \u2013 but a larger cell would have more variety of surface proteins than the one main type found on a coronavirus .\nThe coronavirus group was given the name because they all have the corona of spikes , which is the method they use to enter cells .\nComing Soon : Stay

year .\nYou can smell it .\nYou can taste it .\nYou can see it like a ship gradually becoming bigger on the horizon , heading towards shore .\nIn decades of the globalists \u2019 predictive programming of viruses , outbreaks , and a zombified populace , nothing appeared more in our face than the Bill Gates-led \u201c Contagion Catastrophe \u201d tabletop exercise .\nThe simulation of a \u201c fictional \u201d killer virus launched on October 23 , 2022 .\nThat date preceded the Opening Ceremony of the FIFA World Cup tournament by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday , November 20 , 2022 .\nTwenty-eight days matches the name of the 2002 British horror film , \u201c 28 Days Later.\n\u201d The tagline from the movie reads : \u201c A deadly virus transforms humans into bloodthirsty , rage-filled zombies that leads a handful of survivors on the run.\n\u201d In the trailer , a woman \u2019 s voice warns : \u201c It \u2019 s in the blood.\n\u201d COVID-19 was all about the blood , too .\nOver the past three years of the shamdemic , we learned there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , and Mike Bloomberg \u2019 s John Hopkins University School of Public Health sponsored the virus simulation , this time sans the World Economic Forum .\nLike the 2019 \u201c Event 201 \u201d exercise , which ran a similar drill with a coronavirus outbreak arising out of South America killing 65 million virtual people , Contagion Catastrophe simulated a \u201c fictional pandemic set in the near future \u201d emanating from two states in Northeast Brazil .\nYes , the exact poverty-stricken location as the 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease from nowhere that went nowhere ?\nEarly that year , Anthony Fauci and then CDC Director Thomas Frieden falsely claimed the Zika outbreak caused microcephaly and Gulliane-Barre Syndrome in hundreds of newborn babies in Brazil .\nTheir emergency cries for a pandemic , which never materialized , allowed the plandemic duo to hustle more than $ 1.5 billion from U.S. taxpayers for a Zika vaccine that failed to finish its clinical trials .\nBack then , I covered the Zika Hoax for the Epoch Times here and here .\nWhen President Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he replaced Thomas # MeToo Frieden with Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald , pouring cold water on Fauci \u2019 s wet dream of a pandemic lockdown with Zika vaccine mandates to come .\nUndeterred , Anthony Fauci promised Trump a pandemic would arrive in the president \u2019 s first term as if Fauci were Nostradamus or at least a \u201c seer \u201d like Bill Gates .\nIn 2018 , the United Nations created the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board ( GPMB ) as an exclamation point to Fauci \u2019 s prediction .\nNot ironically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charter member of the GPMB .\nSitting with Fauci at the pandemic planning table were Dr. George Fu Gao , the director of China \u2019 s CDC ; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \u2019 s then president , Dr. Chris Elias ; and four other health experts .\nNorway \u2019 s former prime minister , Gro Harlem Brundtland , led as the co-chair of the new monitoring board .\nIn 2019 , several shoes dropped in the world of predictive programming .\nThey fell well before Event 201 \u2019 s coronavirus exercise .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Threats to Global Health in 2019 \u201d report , making \u201c Vaccine Hesitancy \u201d the seventh top threat .\nDuring the summer , a measles outbreak struck Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Rockland County , New York , and then in Samoa , where the health authorities placed \u201c red flags \u201d outside the unvaccinated peoples \u2019 homes .\nThe red flags sure felt like a precursor to the coming vaccine passport .\nThe real test came , however , when Communist China \u2019 s PLA ran a coronavirus drill at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 .\nThat was the same day the GPMB released its first annual report , \u201c A World at Risk , .\n\u201d On pages 10 and 39 , under \u201c Progress Indicators , \u201d the report stated : \u201c The United Nations ( including WHO ) conducts at least two systemwide training and simulation exercises , including one covering the deliberate release of a lethal respiratory pathogen.\n\u201d [ Emphasis ours ] The declaration came one month to the day prior to Event 201 simulated its drill .\nWhat did Bill Gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catastrophe \u2019 s predecessor in the Wuhan psyop ?\nOn the surface , this exercise toned down the number of virtual people killed by a fictional outbreak .\nHere are some of the key lessons .\n\u201c Participants were challenged to make urgent policy decisions with limited information in the face of uncertainty .\nEach problem and choice had serious health , economic , and social ramifications.\n\u201d [ Emphasis ours ] \u201c To successfully contain such an outbreak , decisive and bold action would need to be taken in the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and potential political resistance\u2026 \u201d \u201c If future pandemics have a much higher lethality than COVID-19\u2026 if they affect predominantly children , would\u2026 countries take different , stronger , earlier measures to contain it , and what are those measures ?\n\u201d In the second lesson , for the Covid cartel to overcome the roadblock of \u201c political resistance , \u201d the WHO \u2019 s global pandemic treaty needs to become an absolute must in terms of politicians selling out their nations \u2019 sovereignty to the global elites .\nThat also explains why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States remains key to ensuring lockstep compliance .\nAs for the pivotal question , it underscores the haphazard way nations conducted their pandemic pantomime in 2020 , despite working off the same World Economic Forum \u201c Great Reset \u201d script .\nHaving lost first mover advantage against the awakening masses , with people mocking the WHO \u2019 s name change of monkeypox to MPox and other stupid , wasteful steps , their pandemic psyop has lost its ability to instill fear .\nWhat few people realized back in 2020 , even heading into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lead roles in the Covid pandemic .\nWuhan , a city of 11 million people , turned on 20 percent of its 5G array of 10,000 antennas on October 18 , 2019 .\nThat was the same day , Wuhan held the Opening Ceremony for the World Military Games .\nAnd that was the same day , Bill Gates \u2019 Event 201 simulated the coronavirus exercise .\nExamining the FIFA World Cup tournament , which concluded yesterday in a thrilling overtime victory with Argentina beating France , there are similarities between Qatar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global health organizations and mainstream media pushed MERS-2 before the World Cup .\nThey then tested \u201c camel flu \u201d to gauge public sentiment on the new name in fear .\nSo far , the headline name has met resistance while being mocked instead of taken seriously .\nThe problem the World Health Organization has with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) in Qatar covered two short weeks , from late March to early April .\nIn that window , only two \u201c laboratory-confirmed \u201d cases and one death occurred in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death was in an 85-year-old man \u201c who complained of multiple chronic diseases.\n\u201d In August 2020 , the CDC adjusted its Covid death numbers downward by 95 percent due to Americans who hosted two or more comorbidities .\nTwo cases and one old man dying with multiple comorbidities don \u2019 t fit the definition of outbreak as \u201c sudden.\n\u201d Regardless , the global health cartel made sure Big Media fanned the flames of camel flu .\nAustralia and the United Kingdom \u2019 s health agencies warned citizens returning from the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c new risk for FIFA fans.\n\u201d The global health cartel recently ratcheted the fear porn : \u201c MERS is far deadlier than Covid\u2014more than a third of people who catch it die compared to less than 4 % of Covid sufferers.\n\u201d Qatar \u2019 s \u201c internet penetration and 5G coverage \u201d for the World Cup was extensive as Wuhan \u2019 s 5G infrastructure three years ago .\n\u201c From Lusail Iconic Stadium in Lusail and Al Bait Stadium in Al-Khor to Al Janoub Stadium in Al Wakrah and Al Thumama Stadium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 8,466 multibeam antennas , covering over 310 miles of RF connector , \u201d according to Telecom Review magazine .\n[ Emphasis ours ] The three premature deaths of journalists covering the sport in Qatar , including Grant Wahl , caught many skeptical people \u2019 s eye about the FIFA tournament .\nHe , the deceased , virtue-signaling sports writer , who complained of \u201c tightness \u201d in and \u201c pressure \u201d on his chest , died last week .\nThe media published articles about him dying from an \u201c unknown cause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status , from \u201c Thrilled to get my 1st Pfizer Covid vaccine dose .\nScience !\n\u201d To , \u201c If you \u2019 re unvaccinated at this point , you \u2019 re asking to be hospitalized or worse.\n\u201d Like Wuhan , Bill Gates \u2019 s prediction for a \u201c Pandemic 2.0 \u201d coming in 2023 runs parallel with the Wuhan flu outbreak that shut down the world without creating a significant excess deaths .\nInstead , the true excess deaths came in 2021 and 2022 after the Covid vaccines rolled out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Contagion Formula started before the FIFA World Cup in Qatar ; and before the Contagion Catastrophe exercise .\nAt its core , the formula includes the following : \u2022 Months later , cover up why people are falling ill \u2022 Deploy dying crisis actors to blow up the death rates These scenarios all happened in Wuhan .\nOne key point that has been overlooked in Wuhan : The CCP launched a new flu shot in August 2019 .\nDid that injection contain graphene oxide , nano-antennas , metals , bio-synthetic parasites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other toxins that Pfizer and Moderna rolled out at the end of 2020 ?\nWho knows ?\nBut as a recent guest in Dr. Tau Braun said on my digital TV show , \u201c Unrestricted Truths \u201d ( Episode 346 ) : \u201c The vaccine is the

future pandemics \u201d , basic research of dangerous pathogens , and of course , the development of new vaccines .\nNothing answers the \u201c why \u201d question better than GNL \u2019 s own website .\n\u201c The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) provides funding for the operations at the GNL , and the lab \u2019 s top priority is research to develop diagnostics , therapeutics and vaccines to combat emerging and re-emerging diseases that threaten public health , not only in our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does have funding help , courtesy of the US Department of Defense , the CDC , and other federal agencies .\nThey also have academic partners and funding from both private foundations and big pharma .\nOf course they do .\nWhat do they work on ?\nWhat specifically do GNL researchers work on ?\nThe researchers are nationally known for expertise in four main areas : Ebola .\nMarburg .\nMERS and Covid-19 .\nBut these four are not the only focus of GNL researchers .\nThey also look at pathogens AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ticks that carry diseases that are \u201c of grave concern to the NIH \u201d \u2013 things like malaria , west Nile virus , Zika and more .\nBut never fear , GNL is developing countermeasures for all these disease threats ; they \u2019 re called \u2018 select agents \u2019 and are a high priority to be studied by GNL for several reasons , including their \u201c potential to be used as weapons around the world.\n\u201d The Galveston National Laboratory is home to research that is funded by NIAID , the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Disease Control & Prevention and other federal agencies , as well as academic partners , private foundations , and the biopharmaceutical industry .\nIt is more than interesting that GAVI ( Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations ) , a Bill Gates \u2019 funded entity , has published articles on all of these \u201c emerging threat \u201d diseases .\nThe site reminds all of us about the deadly 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in Africa , and also reminds us that there is a current outbreak in Uganda .\nGAVI lets us know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the utmost essence should the Ebola virus penetrate the Ugandan borders .\nGAVI calls Marburg the deadly cousin of ebola , and lets everyone know that it kills nine out of 10 people it infects .\nThey specifically name both international travel and globalization as powerful sources of potential outbreaks .\nA big pharma whistleblower named Kieran Morrisey let everyone know that a company had developed a PCR test in 2018 for Marburg , an obscure disease that has only killed 16 people worldwide in the last two decades .\nWhy would we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need a vaccine ?\nYet the vaccine called RiVax was being created for just this purpose , by a company called Soligenix , with NIAID funding the research .\nSubsequently GAVI posts an article in April 2021 , right in the middle of COVID , declaring that the next pandemic will likely be Marburg !\nSo what does GAVI have to do with the GNL ?\nMaybe nothing .\nMaybe everything .\nTime will tell .\nThe main point is that prior to COVID , how many of us knew much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t , and I live here .\nWhen Harvey hit in 2017 , the community had major concerns .\nAfter the storm , no one could reach the GNL to determine damage that ensued .\nEarlier in 2013 , the lab actually lost a vial of the Guanarito virus , a deadly Venezuelan virus , similar to ebola .\nBut good news \u2013 the CDC and the FBI were called in to investigate .\nI couldn \u2019 t find any conclusive articles about whether the vial was actually found .\nInstead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the virus probably accidentally threw the vial away \u2013 you know , an accident in a lab with the strictest security measures on the planet .\nTh CDC experts determined that this was never a public health risk , so we should all be comfortable that we are in good hands .\n( Note : did anyone look in Ukraine ? )\nMore recently , in 2020 , the GNL was under pressure to discuss their work with the Wuhan Institute of Virology .\nDuring 2014-2019 , the GNL had 34 contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huawei Technologies .\nDid University of Texas report everything they were engaged in with China ?\nAuthorities wanted to know .\nFor example , a 2018 agreement was an exchange program where America \u2019 s top national security scientists did research that they shared with the institute in Wuhan .\nThe GNL even bragged about its work in Wuhan , saying they actually directed the Wuhan operations and then boasted about the short- and long-term personnel exchanges between the two institutes .\nThe US government investigation launched in 2020 specifically focused on GNL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zhengli , the famous \u201c Batwoman \u201d researcher from the Wuhan Institute .\nThe official GNL statement said that the lab had absolutely complied with all required reporting about all relationships .\nGNL authorities went on to say that they belonged to NIAID and in fact had relationships with over 70 countries , not just China .\nThe concern about contracts with China \u2013 GNL or otherwise \u2013 is regarding ties to China \u2019 s Thousand Talents Plan to recruit leading scientists to China .\nSigned contracts mandate that participating scientists must keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any intellectual property to the sponsoring Chinese institution , and abide by Chinese law .\nThe concern is this : all of these stipulations are incentives for scientists to set up \u201c shadow labs \u201d in China to copy US taxpayer-funded research .\nAt the end of 2019 , the FBI was investigating 180 such cases at more than 70 US institutions , and GNL was one of them .\nFast forward to August 2022 when the president of the University of Texas Medical Branch , Dr. Ben Raimer , abruptly resigned much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raimer had been at UTMB for 40 years .\nTwo weeks earlier , Raimer was put on administrative leave for undisclosed reasons , but UTMB was quick to point out that his departure was in no way connected to GNL .\nThe UT System has resisted inquiries from press for more information , and responded to an open records request that all documents have exceptions to disclosure , as reported by the Galveston Daily News , Texas \u2019 oldest newspaper .\nMonths earlier , Robert Thomas , UTMB vice president for strategic initiatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amy Shaw Thomas , the senior vice chancellor for health affairs in the UT System .\nGalveston islanders can \u2019 t prove but suspect that the two resignations are related .\nRaimer has said that his dismissal was a witch hunt gone rogue .\nHe said he knows there was an anonymous complaint about him and that he had been forced out , but he is innocent : \u201c I broke no laws of the federal government , of God , of mankind or anyone else.\n\u201d What have I learned ?\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard .\nWe all need to pay more attention to these seemingly unrelated news stories that come out .\nThank goodness some of the information is out in the open , and hopefully the full story will soon be known .\nLike what you \u2019 re reading on The Tenpenny Report ?\nShare this article with your friends .\nHelp us grow .\nFed Up Texas Chick is a contributing writer for The Tenpenny Report .\nShe \u2019 s a rocket scientist turned writer , having worked

?\nThinking of chunking it ?\nNot so fast !\nFreeze it instead .\nWe are sharing this guest post by Stan Szymanski of Encouraging Angels .\nWho knew fruitcake was a superb survival food ?\nThanks , Stan .\nThe price of \u2018 survival food \u2019 ( like the traditional Datrex 3600 Calorie Emergency Food Bar ) has gone up like everything else due to central bank money printing and the now advance demand for the food that will not be on store shelves next year .\nIdentified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Datrex 2 pack currently costs $ 27.99 .\nThat is expensive when you talk about having to have extra when the days of economy and prudence truly take hold .\nThe calories needed to keep an active military age male fighting effectively in the field can range anywhere between 3,000 to an almost unbelievable 4,600 calories daily .\nWhile many of us are not as young , nor as fit as those military personnel , the fact remains that we will have vastly higher caloric requirements when the lights go out .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( like splitting wood and walking/riding bikes to get around as well as potentially spending a lot of time outside watching/defending our homes/neighborhood ) to physically rise to the challenge of a more austere life .\nIf you have to drive somewhere , gas is necessary for your car .\nAnd if you have to hike for two days for an essential need or person you need gas for you .\nThat gas is known as calories .\nThe ancient warriors of Rome knew this .\nThey were an early adopter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ration ( the Egyptians were first to use it as part of the burial process -that- is some long term storage ! )\n.\n\u2026 \u2019 In Roman times , soldiers would bring fruitcake like bars \u2013 called \u2018 satura \u2018 \u2013 into battle .\nThey used barley mash as the base and studded it with pine nuts , raisins , and pomegranate seeds .\nThese cakes were incredibly portable and would last a long time without spoiling .\nSatura may be an early ancestor of the fruitcake , but it also has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !\n\u2019 \u2026 ( courtesy of \u2018 Many Eats \u2019 ) So you see , this food we speak of has been used and tested in the field of battle which means that it is suitable ( check with your doctor-this is not medical advice ) for our use in times of stress and need of higher caloric content foods .\nIt has also was famously enjoyed by soldiers during World War I. I am providing the link to a great \u2018 Trench Cake \u2019 that I have personally made thanks to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 Survival Blog \u2019 : \u2026 \u2019 The following recipe for Trench Fuitcake kindly comes to us from SurvivalBlog reader Allie E. This recipe dates to World War I , when English and Scottish families often mailed parcels with fruit cakes to their sons , grandsons , husbands , and nephews serving in the trenches of France and Belgium .\nHence , the name : \u201c Trench Fruitcake \u201d or just \u201c Trench Cake.\n\u201d This makes a great storage food treat , to break up the monotony of other stored foods .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 years of storage with no significant change in flavor or consistency \u2014 although of course their nutritive value diminishes , over time.\n\u2019 \u2026 ( Survival Blog Trench Cake Recipe/story 8/16/21 ) Most food ration bars ( like a Datrex et .\nal . )\nonly claims 5 years of basic effective use .\nI have recently eaten some \u2018 Datrex-like \u2019 bars that were 7 years old ( and 2 years out of date ) and they were just fine .\nGreat with a cup of coffee .\nApparently , fruitcakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been found to have been good upwards of 10 years !\nYour mileage may vary .\nOver the long term , most of us will not have the luxury of a large stockpile of Datrex-type bars because it would be cost prohibitive .\nTherefore , we need to be able to adapt and make our own fruitcake rations with the available wherewithal that we have on hand .\nOne person may have a lot of currants and no bags of dried mixed fruits .\nOne can still use the basic recipe and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long lasting item that is able to be replenished if one has access to fruit and nut tress in the area .\nOne person may only have an apple tree .\nThat person would have to most likely have to dry some apples in order to use them in the fruitcake if it is to last .\nWe really have to use our minds and ask God to reveal the assets in food that may be available to us if we just knew where to look or who to ask .\nHaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is available through concerted Bible reading , prayer and obedience to the commands , word and will of He who made us is a far greater intelligence we can access than any earthly knowledge .", "author": "Fed Up Texas Chick", "url": "https://vaxxter.com/back-to-the-future-with-fruitcake/", "published": "Wed, 28 Dec 2022 17:30:00 +0000", "published_utc": 1672266600, "collection_utc": 1675814845}]
