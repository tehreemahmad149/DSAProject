brazen shoplifting and retail ransackings multiply , a New York City man faces trial next month for his alleged role in the theft of nearly $ 200,000 in merchandise from a Chanel store in Manhattan \u2019 s Soho neighborhood .\nProsecutors charge that Eric Spencer , 30 , and three cohorts robbed the luxury retailer in broad daylight last February , netting armfuls of wallets and handbags .\nFlashing a firearm in his waistband , Spencer allegedly yelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d while directing his fellow robbers to \u201c Get everything !\nGrab everything !\n\u201d Within a week of the February 2 Chanel heist , FBI agents identified Spencer as the robbery \u2019 s ringleader , and he was arrested later that month in Florida .\nIn custody since his collar , Spencer is now locked up in a New Jersey county jail , where he has been sanctioned for \u201c exposing himself multiple times \u201d to a female correctional officer and for telling a second guard , \u201c I want to fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to a court filing .\nSpencer has been denied bail , in part , due to a criminal history that includes three felony and 13 misdemeanor convictions ( for offenses like grand larceny and possession of stolen goods ) .\nAdditionally , the Brooklyn resident faces three separate state indictments charging him with a total of 20 grand larcenies or robberies at Manhattan retailers between 2018 and 2020 .\nProsecutors have estimated that Spencer -- the only individual to be arrested for the Chanel robbery -- faces a sentence of between 120 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at trial of federal robbery and conspiracy counts .\nIn the Chanel case , FBI agents have gathered surveillance video , texts , and cell phone records that appear to incriminate Spencer ( seen below ) .\nBeginning on the night of the robbery , investigators say , Spencer \u201c repeatedly \u201d looked online for news of the crime , using search terms like \u201c Chanel store robbery , \u201d \u201c soho robbery , \u201d and \u201c robbers in soho.\n\u201d Spencer \u2019 s phone , seized when he was arrested , included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those images showed that they were taken in the days after the Soho robbery .\nMessages on Spencer \u2019 s phone showed several potential customers seeking Chanel products .\nBut Spencer replied that his inventory was spent : \u201c I had Chanel bags they all gone thou \u201d and \u201c Nomore bags bro.\n\u201d The inquiries appear to have been spurred by a post to Spencer \u2019 s Twitter account the day after the Soho rampage : \u201c SO MUCH DOUBLE C RN I COULD OPEN A SMALL BOUTIQUE FRFR.\n\u201d As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C \u201d is a reference to Chanel , whose logo is a pair of interlocking \u201c Cs.\n\u201d As for \u201c FRFR , \u201d a court filing notes , that is shorthand for \u201c for real , for real , \u201d or \u201c seriously.\n\u201d In a recorded jailhouse conversation with his girlfriend , Spencer sought to \u201c create a false exculpatory narrative , \u201d according to prosecutor Matthew Shahabian .\nReferring to the \u201c Double C \u201d tweet -- which was cited in the criminal complaint filed against him -- Spencer explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but instead to the brand Coach ( which has two \u201c Cs \u201d in its name ) .\nSwatting away this claim with a \u201c Contra , e.g.\n\u201d citation , Shahabian noted that on the 2020 track \u201c Coco \u201d by \u201c 24kGoldn ft. DaBaby , \u201d the rappers refer to Chanel as \u201c Double-C. \u201d In addition to including the genius.com URL containing the full \u201c Coco \u201d lyrics , Shahabian quoted part of the song \u2019 s chorus : \u201c Coco Chanel , double-C lock on the belt.\n\u201d Elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c Double C 's on the belt correlate the ice hit ( Bling , bling ) .\n\u201d The day before FBI agents arrested him , Spencer discussed \u201c acquiring \u201d more Chanel merchandise , according to investigators .\nIn an exchange of messages , Spencer told an acquaintance , \u201c Lols I \u2019 ma have some more Chanel.\n\u201d The duo then discussed a luxury goods store in West Palm Beach .\nAfter being told that \u201c West Palm has strip stores like soho , \u201d Spencer replied , \u201c Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] ima tear there ass up lol.\n\u201d In December , Spencer replaced his lawyer , who had been engaging in plea negotiations with the government .\nThe attorney , Aaron Goldsmith , reported to the court that his relationship with Spencer had \u201c broken down beyond a point of repair.\n\u201d Last month , Spencer \u2019 s new counsel made a bail application that was quickly denied by Judge Gregory Woods .\nIn support of that motion , Spencer mailed a three-page handwritten letter to Woods claiming that , \u201c I \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super far from a bad person.\n\u201d He also declared that , \u201c It would be almost impossible to find anywhere in America a black man who has lived further down in the mud of human society than I have , or a black man who has been any more ignorant than I have been ; or a black man who has suffered more anguish during his life than I have.\n\u201d ( 4 pages )", "author": "wbastone", "url":
