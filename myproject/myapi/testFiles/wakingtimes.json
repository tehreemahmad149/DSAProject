interview to Joe Rogan which aired on New Year \u2019 s Eve .\nIf you \u2019 ve got three hours to spare , we recommend you watch the entire thing ( cliffs notes here ) : Malone , an expert in mRNA vaccine technologies who trained at UC Davis , UCSD and the Salk Institute , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday .\nIt appears he \u2019 s preparing to sue , as Alex Berenson is currently doing .\nThe suspension came after Malone was vilified by a hit piece in The Atlantic which was funded by Facebook and Johnson & Johnson .\n\u201c Three days before this thing came out , the journalist \u2013 he previously publishes on \u2018 woke \u2019 issues on the topic of higher education .\nHe \u2019 s clearly hired .\nAnd they explicitly say the article was funded by the Robert Boyd Johnson foundation and the Zuckerberg-Chan initiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert , why are you saying these things ?\nYou must have some financial incentive .\nThere must be some reason you \u2019 re doing this \u2018 \u2013 and I told him repeatedly , \u2018 because it \u2019 s the right thing to do.\n\u2019 I think I \u2019 m the only one who has been involved deeply in the development of this tech , that doesn \u2019 t have a financial stake in it .\nFor me , the reason is , because what \u2019 s happening is not right .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s destroying the practice of medicine worldwide \u2026 I \u2019 m a vaccinologist .\nI spent 30 years developing vaccines .\nA stupid amount of education learning how to do it , and what the rules are .\nAnd for me , I \u2019 m personally offended watching my discipline get destroyed for no good reason at all except , apparently , financial incentives , and \u2013 I dunno \u2013 political ass-covering ?\n\u201d -Robert Malone \u201c Our government is out of control on this , \u201d Malone continues .\n\u201c And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bioethics .\nThey completely disregard the federal common-rule .\nThey have broken all the rules that I know of , that I \u2019 ve been trained for years and years and years .\nThese mandates of an experimental vaccines are explicitly illegal .\nThey are explicitly inconsistent with the Nuremberg code .\nThey are explicitly inconsistent with the Belmont report .\nThey are flat out illegal , and they don \u2019 t care.\n\u201c Malone then explained to Rogan how the Uttar Pradesh province in India crushed Covid with early treatment that included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden administration met with Modi and a \u2018 decision was made not to disclose the contents of the treatment.\n\u2019 They then went deeper into the topic of ivermectin and early interventions in general .\nAccording to Malone , \u201c There are good modeling studies , that show a half a million excess deaths have happened in the US , through the intentional blockade of early COVID treatment by the US Government.\n\u201d Malone and Rogan then got into some heavy science behind Covid \u2013 with Malone explaining how people with natural Covid @

"content": "Get the latest Waking Times articles delivered to your inbox .\nSign up here .\nThe Alchemical process of transformation has four distinct stages : Nigredo , Albedo , Citrinitas and Rubedo .\nThese stages are the framework of Jung \u2019 s characterization of the four stages of character transformation : Confession , Illumination , Education , and Transformation , culminating in the completion of the magnum opus and the creation of the Philosopher \u2019 s Stone .\nA robust character hinges on eight core virtues : courage , moderation , wisdom , justice , curiosity , honor , humility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all be needed to navigate the four stages of transformation .\nWe enter Nigredo with curiosity and courage .\nWe enter Albedo with moderation and justice .\nWe enter Citrinitas with honor and wisdom .\nWe enter Rubedo with humility and humor .\nOne might ask , why enter at all ?\nWe enter into self-transformation to prevent getting stuck in self-preservation .\nWe challenge the lodestone to create steppingstones that will eventually lead to the self-actualization of the Philosopher \u2019 s Stone .\nThe process of confession begins alchemically with the concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blackening.\n\u201d It \u2019 s a psychosymbolic death .\nThis is the stage of revelation and catharsis .\nIt \u2019 s where we burn away our psychological dross .\nIt \u2019 s where the shadow gets integrated and then mined for hidden gold .\nAs Carl Jung said , \u201c No tree can grow to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell.\n\u201d Our shadow reaches all the way into hell .\nWe climb into hell to integrate it .\nWe climb into hell to animate our inner monster and bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self .\nThis is no easy task .\nIt \u2019 s a dark time .\nDespair and disillusionment are all consuming .\nThe ego is murdered by the Id .\nThe blackening is a cocooning that cooks the corpse of the ego inside it .\nAnnihilation becomes integration : the marriage of chaos and order , the coalescence of shadow and light , the union of summit and abyss .\nThis gives way to the illumination of the Albedo .\nThe process of illumination begins alchemically with the concept of the albedo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the stage of awakening and insight .\nIt \u2019 s where our new shadow perspective helps us deflate the ego and where unneeded , illusory , or false conceptualizations are shed .\nIt \u2019 s where the anima/animus gets integrated and cultivated for maximal co-efficiency .\nThe personality becomes a masterpiece when the masculine integrates the anima and the feminine integrated the animus , and vice versa .\nThe ashes leftover from the blackening are purified by the persona \u2019 s opposite .\nThe black crow is transformed into a white raven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lighthearted diamond .\nThe end of the lesser work is at hand and the beginning of the higher work becomes manifest .\nAnima/animus integration is no simple task .\nBut it is quite rewarding .\nAs we begin to resolve the animus in every yin and the anima in every yang , we discover that there \u2019 s a lightside to every darkside , a softness buried within even the roughest patch .\nThere \u2019 s even good luck hidden inside bad luck .\nA man honoring his anima and a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be reckoned with , what Nietzsche referred to as the \u201c Primordial Unity.\n\u201d For they are that much closer to achieving cosmic heroism .\nThey have become a force of integrated nature first and individual human second .\nThis leads to the sacred dawn of consciousness .\n\u201c Every one of us is a mystic .\nWe may or may not realize it , we may not even like it .\nBut whether we know it or not , whether we accept it or not , mystical experience is always there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate discovery .\nWe have been given the gift of life in this perplexing world to become who we ultimately are : creatures of boundless love , caring , compassion , and wisdom .\nExistence is a summons to the eternal journey of the sage \u2013 the sage we all are , if only we could see.\n\u201d ~Wayne Teasdale The process of education begins alchemically with the concept of the citrinitas , also called \u201c the yellowing.\n\u201d This is the stage of absorption and wisdom .\nIt \u2019 s where our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solar dawn of the emerging soul .\nIt \u2019 s where the inner student meets the inner master , where Courage meets Wisdom , where the animal shakes hands with the sage .\nIt \u2019 s where the wise old man ( or woman ) archetype gets integrated into the whole .\nThe dawn of the soul is like the rising sun , golden , radiant , and enlightening .\nIt gives color and shape to the once colorless black and white world .\nIt \u2019 s the lovechild of shadow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our ego \u2019 s death .\nThe emergence of Christ consciousness : From the blackening on the cross to the whitening between worlds to the yellowing into rebirth .\nOur inner sage grips the masterpiece .\nAs Aristotle stated , \u201c What more accurate stand or measure of good things do we have than the Sage ?\n\u201d The sage leads us into the alchemical success of the magnum opus , the bleeding out into transformation itself .\nThe process of transformation begins with the concept of the rubedo , also called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c final \u201d stage of transpersonal self-overcoming .\nIt \u2019 s where the alchemy of psychology becomes a fountainhead .\nIt \u2019 s where the unity of opposites\u2014shadow and light , anima and animus , beast and sage\u2014 becomes transcendent , provident , and mercurial .\nIt \u2019 s where the Self archetype becomes the process of Integration itself .\nThe reddening is a bleeding into blackening .\nIt \u2019 s the life-death-rebirth process lived through in real time , in each moment , with each new breath .\nIt \u2019 s both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling into rising , both a chaos creating order and an order creating chaos .\nSelf-awareness is self-improvement is self-overcoming .\nThere is no self-actualization without self-transformation .\nAnd so , the Self archetype is ever in the throes of overcoming itself .\nIn the end , there is no end .\nThere is no remaining , there \u2019 s no settled state , there \u2019 s no final stage .\nThe magnum opus eats itself or it doesn \u2019 t sing .\nThe Philosopher \u2019 s Stone is always just ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The journey is always the thing or it is nothing .\nThe sword is always sharpened dullness .\nThe diamond of the self is always pressurized coal .\nAs James Hillman said ,

this sure to be epic Year of the Tiger\u2026 2022 .\nIn Chinese lore , the tiger symbolizes strength , braveness , and the courage to confront and overcome evil .\nThe tiger personality is one of high moral character , authority , self-assuredness , power and confidence .\nThere has never been a time in my life when these qualities were more needed than they are now , so if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding personal sovereignty , informed consent , rejection of irrationality and illogic , rejection of corrupt science , and an adherence to your own personal moral code , then I salute you , and this message is for you .\nIn November of 2020 Waking Times turned 10 years old , and it wasn \u2019 t until the last couple of weeks that the truth about this project fully registered with me .\nI actually took some real , quality time off over the last couple of weeks to reflect on our journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how I can best continue to fulfill this project \u2019 s original intent .\nThe terrain we \u2019 re in has changed so dramatically and suddenly , but I \u2019 m finally adapting and ready to acknowledge that business as usual is just not serving this world in a way that adequately honors the vast depth of my personal power , experience , knowledge , skill , humility , good will , and love for humanity and this earth .\nThis project was originally about my journey of personal transformation within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and absurdity .\nIn short , it has been about overcoming programmed self-sabotage and self-destruction , and learning to walk the path of self-mastery .\nThis is the stuff that truly lights up my soul .\nFor the last few years I \u2019 ve struggled to maintain inspiration for this project , and I \u2019 ve finally come to understand why .\nI had for years been trying to force this project back into alignment with an outdated business model after having long outgrown the man I was when I started this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is changing more rapidly than most of us can genuinely comprehend , and it had outpaced me .\nNot anymore , however .\nThe work I do here was never meant for a world that devalues the individual , that demands censorship , that won \u2019 t tolerate rebels , that refuses to look in the mirror , and that has been successfully trained to acquiesce to the lies and misrepresentations of the corporate state .\nThe engineered proliferation of neighborhood bootlickers and next-door authoritarians has already happened , and the march is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have changed .\nBut I maintain a distinctly cosmic , zoomed-out perspective on life , on our situation , and on our struggles together .\nIt all has a deeper meaning to me .\nAdversity is where people like you and thrive , and the deep truth is that without such challenges we spirit warriors lose our way , disconnect from our purpose , and slip into complacency and despondency .\nThat said , I can tell that we \u2019 re better off now than we \u2019 ve ever been .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformation , because the challenges are more real and visceral than ever before .\nBut if you \u2019 re stuck ( like I was ) in a clutched , forced grip on the old normal , you \u2019 re going to be torn apart .\nThe anxiety will consume you .\nThe fear , and the fear of the fear will eat at you .\nYour soul will be put on standby , waiting for you to release your death grip on a past and a story that has already been paved over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and the avalanche of a sick culture .\nLet me ask you\u2026 what is your purpose in life ?\nWhat are you here to do

your family and community who haven \u2019 t been as pressed to evolve as you have .\nThe absolutely brutal onslaught of propaganda , censorship , reckless obedience , mindless conformity , mass psychosis and hysteria in our world today can only be countered by those who \u2019 ve mastered emotional stability .\nWe simply must learn to find peace and gratitude in every aspect of the storm we \u2019 re in , because the positive changes people like you and I seek will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , infinite courage , and an indomitable warrior spirit .\nYet so many in this world have fallen under the spell , choosing to abandon their values in a futile attempt to appease the powers-that-be and bury their fears and insecurities about life itself .\nThis is a heavy moral conflict , and those doing the dance of appeasement are quickly finding out that the game is rigged against them , that the promises of government and corporate media are lies , and that there will be no end to the demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pressure which offers a reason to create a way out and a way forward .\nThe old normal ain \u2019 t coming back , friends .\nTime to move on together .\nFor the last year I \u2019 ve been

creative efforts in life seeking ways in which to control or kill people ?\nThey \u2019 re out there .\nIn 2008 at a speech at the international affairs think tank Chatham House , the late , great swamp creature Zbigniev Brezynksi made the following comment : Brezynski would know , as he haunted to halls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and think tanks for decades .\nHe held a uniquely elitist perspective on the world , and in his classic globalist book The Grand Chessboard : American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives he shared an inside look at this mindset .\nThose in power view the entire world as a play ground to be manipulated , controlled , conquered , and destroyed if necessary .\nOur lives are the pawns of tyrants\u2026 as they see it .\nThis is the curse of government , which is nothing without force and violence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the current global tension we all endure .\nI wonder , though , had he lived long enough to play a role in the pandemic power grab , would he have been impressed by advances in the ability to control so many people without deploying troops , smart-bombs and sanctions ?\nMy magic eight-ball says , \u2018 you may rely on it.\n\u2019 You see , one thing we \u2019 ve learned ( whether you recognize it or not ) is that it is now far easier to control people than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You sideline them by programming them to engage in self-sabotage and self-destructive behavior .\nAnd how do you accomplish this ?\nMind control comes in many forms , but in essence it is the ability to get people to believe , think , and act against their natural impulses and in accordance with an imposed agenda .\nAmerican psychologist and professor emeritus at Stanford University , Phillip Zombardo , refers to mind control as , \u201c the process by which individual or collective freedom of choice and action is compromised by agents or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivation , affect , cognition or behavioral outcomes.\n\u201d His ground breaking research project , The Stanford Prison Experiment , demonstrated that most people are highly susceptible to the influence of group behavior , and that many of us would go so far as to harm others just to be in compliance with the directives of someone in a perceived position of authority .\nIn today \u2019 s fustercluck world , the effects of mind control are evident everywhere , and under present conditions is even manifesting it its most dangerous form\u2026 mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud of disillusionment are easily influenced and will readily sacrifice their own health and well-being in deference to the advice and mandates of \u2018 experts \u2019 and policy makers who pimp fear then offer a phony respite from it .\nConsider how this plays out in our society : 1 .\nDumb down the population with chemical sedatives including alcohol , pharmaceuticals and toxic food ingredients .\n2 .\nMonopolize the media under corporate control .\nPresent biased , toxic opinions as \u2018 news \u2019 24 hours a day , deliberately creating division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 .\nCensor any information and opinions which counter the propaganda of the corporate state , making it seem like minority authoritarian positions are of the majority .\n4 .\nEntrain the masses to believe that censorship is necessary for their protection , and that to speak out in opposition to the corporate state amounts to a physical threat to their safety .\n5 .\nElevate a culture of celebrity worship , and promote degeneracy and stupidity as virtuous forms of pseudo-rebellion .\n6 .\nIndoctrinate children from an early age to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that the state is infallible no matter how many atrocities it commits .\n7 .\nIsolate people from each other .\nDisconnect them from the grounding and diverse influence of family and friends .\n8 .\nAssault the senses of the population with an endless stream of trauma based mind control and fear propaganda .\n9 .\nEntrain common people to believe that being broke and poor is virtuous , while encouraging a massive wealth gap between the elites and the rest of society .\n10 .\nDestabilize traditional communal and familial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dysfunctional relationships .\n11 .\nGut the value of the only permissible currency so that typical gender roles are flipped and both members of a nuclear family must work in order to provide a basic life while children their must be sent to expensive daycares and government run schools .\n12 .\nConfuse people over simple biological issues like gender , and create a cult of official science followers who are unwilling to acknowledge such basic scientific facts .\n13 .\nDestroy the most powerful and capable members of society , the alpha-males @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n14 .\nFocus the attention of the masses on an invisible , intangible , omni-present fear such as an unstoppable plague that is constantly changing forms .\n15 .\nRequire people to seek permission from the government for practically every productive endeavor possible .\n16 .\nCorral the masses into a system of technological control which prohibits free association and free enterprise , and punishes those most likely to resist .\n15 .\nElevate the most criminally insane members of government , and give them open-ended , free access to 24 hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and holistic forms of medicine , corralling everyone into a top-down , one-size fits all , for-profit , absurdly expensive , allopathic medical system .\n17 .\nDisconnect people from genuine , personal spiritual connection , so that they live with an insatiable fear of death in constant inner turmoil .\n18 .\nOver time , socially engineer a societal tribe of dysfunctional , unhealthy , confused , resentful , broke , state-worshippers who may wish to live a prosperous life , but can not ever manage to overcome the urges of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act in their own best interests .\nThe end result of all this is an individual who has been so beaten down by circumstance and chronic stress that they require stimulants all day to function , and sedatives all night to cope with the madness of it all .\nAnd conveniently , there just happens to be a coffee shop on every corner and a full service bar on every street .\nNearly all of us engage in self-sabotaging and self-destructive behavior , which is great for guys like Brezynski , because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before .\nThe act of living \u2018 normally \u2019 in this environment makes you a non-threat to those managing the chessboard .\nYou are controlled by virtue of your inability to stay on your own unique path of self-mastery .\nFriends , this is social engineering at its most advanced , and while it \u2019 s informative to understand what has happened to our society , your imperative now is to internalize this as a demand to eliminate such influences from your life .\nYou must seek to understand how these influences have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must engage in the work needed to reconnect you with you inner wisdom and authority .\nSelf-sabotage is a gift to the elite .\nIt puts you on the sideline of life and has you constantly burning your energy in a permanent war against yourself .\nIt makes it nearly impossible for you to make positive changes in your life or have a positive impact on your community or this world .\nIt makes you aloof and dependent on the directives of skilled profiteers who utilize the science of the mind against you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s world it is far easier to control billions of people than to murder them .\nAnd unless you commit to taking back control of your life , you are fulfilling your directive as their pawn .\nIf you want to deeply understand how this works and what you can do about it , join me on January 26th for a special live Zoom event , Crack

\u2019 s propaganda , and most decisive when it \u2019 s censorship you never knew happened .\nWhen we imagine that the U.S. military only occasionally and slightly influences US movies , we are extremely badly deceived .\nThe actual impact is on thousands of movies made , and thousands of others never made .\nAnd television shows of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the US military on game shows and cooking shows are no more spontaneous or civilian in origin than the ceremonies glorifying members of the US military at professional sports games \u2014 ceremonies that have been paid for and choreographed by US tax dollars and the US military .\nThe \u201c entertainment \u201d content carefully shaped by the \u201c entertainment \u201d offices of the Pentagon and the CIA doesn \u2019 t just insidiously prepare people to react differently to news about war and peace in the world .\nTo a huge extent it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn very little actual news about the world at all .\nThe US military knows that few people watch boring and non-credible news programs , much less read boring and non-credible newspapers , but that great masses will eagerly watch long movies and TV shows without too much worrying about whether anything makes sense .\nWe know that the Pentagon knows this , and what military officials scheme and plot as a result of knowing this , because of the work of relentless researchers making use of the Freedom of Information Act .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages of memos , notes , and script re-writes .\nI don \u2019 t know whether they \u2019 ve put all of these documents online \u2014 I certainly hope they do and that they make the link widely available .\nI wish such a link were in giant font at the end of a fantastic new film .\nThe film is called Theaters of War : How the Pentagon and CIA Took Hollywood .\nThe Director , Editor , and Narrator is Roger Stahl .\nThe Co-Producers are Matthew Alford , Tom Secker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided an important public service .\nIn the film we see copies of and hear quotations from and analysis of much of what has been uncovered , and learn that thousands of pages exist that nobody has yet seen because the military has refused to produce them .\nFilm producers sign contracts with the US military or CIA .\nThey agree to \u201c weave in key talking points.\n\u201d While unknown quantities of this sort of thing remain unknown , we do know that nearly 3,000 films and many thousands of TV episodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many others have been handled by the CIA .\nIn many film productions , the military effectively becomes a co-producer with veto power , in exchange for allowing the use of military bases , weapons , experts , and troops .\nThe alternative is the denial of those things .\nBut the military is not as passive as this might suggest .\nIt actively pitches new story ideas to movie and TV producers .\nIt seeks out new ideas and new collaborators who might bring them to a theater or laptop near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life as a recruitment advertisement .\nOf course , many movies are made without military assistance .\nMany of the best never wanted it .\nMany that wanted it and were denied , managed to get made anyway , sometimes at much greater expense without the US tax dollars paying for the props .\nBut a huge number of movies are made with the military .\nSometimes the initial movie in a series is made with the military , and the remaining episodes voluntarily follow the military \u2019 s line .\nPractices are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this work , including for recruitment purposes .\nThe alliance between the military and Hollywood is the main reason that we have lots of big blockbuster movies on certain topics and few if any on others .\nStudios have written scripts and hired top actors for movies on things like Iran-Contra that have never seen the light of day because of a Pentagon rejection .\nSo , nobody watches Iran-Contra movies for fun the way they might watch a Watergate movie for fun .\nSo , very few people have any notions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what the US military does being so awful , what , you might wonder , are the good topics that do get lots of movies made about them ?\nA lot are fantasy or distortion .\nBlack Hawk Down turned reality ( and a book it was \u201c based on \u201d ) on its head , as did Clear and Present Danger .\nSome , like Argo , hunt for small stories within large ones .\nScripts explicitly tell audiences that it doesn \u2019 t matter who started a war for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the heroism of troops trying to survive or to rescue a soldier .\nYet , actual US military veterans are often shut out and not consulted They often find movies rejected by the Pentagon as \u201c unrealistic \u201d to be very realistic , and those created with Pentagon collaboration to be highly unrealistic .\nOf course , a huge number of military-influenced films are made about the US military fighting space aliens and magical creatures \u2014 not , clearly , because it \u2019 s believable but because it avoids reality .\nOn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape people \u2019 s views of targeted nations and dehumanize the humans living in certain places .\nDon \u2019 t Look Up is not mentioned in Theaters of War , and presumably had no military involvement ( who knows ?\n, certainly not the movie-watching public ) , yet it uses a standard military-culture idea ( the need to blow up something coming from outerspace , which in reality the US government would simply love to do and you could hardly stop them ) as an analogy for the need to stop destroying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can not easily get the US government to remotely consider ) and not one reviewer notices that the film is an equally good or bad analogy for the need to stop building nuclear weapons \u2014 because US culture has had that need effectively excised .\nThe military has written policies on what it approves and disapproves .\nIt disapproves depictions of failures and crimes , which eliminates much of reality .\nIt rejects films about veteran suicide , racism in the military , sexual harassment and assault in the military .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ films because they \u2019 re not \u201c realistic.\n\u201d Yet , if you watch enough of what is produced with military involvement you \u2019 ll imagine that using and surviving nuclear war is perfectly plausible .\nThis goes back to the original Pentagon-Hollywood invention of myths about Hiroshima and Nagasaki , and runs right up through military influence on The Day After , not to mention the transformation \u2014 paid for by people who throw a fit if their tax dollars help prevent someone freezing on the street \u2014 of Godzilla from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original script for the first Iron Man movie , the hero went up against the evil weapons dealers .\nThe US military rewrote it so that he was a heroic weapons dealer who explicitly argued for more military funding .\nSequels stuck with that theme .\nThe US military advertised its weapons of choice in Hulk , Superman , Fast and Furious , and Transformers , the US public effectively paying to push itself to support paying thousands of times more \u2014 for weapons it would otherwise have no interest in .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ History , and National Geographic channels are military-made commercials for weapons .\n\u201c Inside Combat Rescue \u201d on National Geographic is recruitment propaganda .\nCaptain Marvel exists to sell the Air Force to women .\nActress Jennifer Garner has made recruitment ads to accompany movies she \u2019 s made that are themselves more effective recruitment ads .\nA movie called The Recruit was largely written by the head of the CIA \u2019 s entertainment office .\nShows like NCIS push out the military \u2019 s line .\nBut so do shows you wouldn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV shows , game shows , talk shows ( with endless reunifications of family members ) , cooking shows , competition shows , etc .\nI \u2019 ve written before about how Eye in the Sky was openly and proudly both completely unrealistic nonsense and influenced by the US military to shape people \u2019 s ideas about drone murders .\nA lot of people have some small idea of what goes on .\nBut Theaters of War : How the Pentagon and CIA Took Hollywood helps us to grasp the scale of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , we may gain some possible insights into why polling finds much of the world fearing the US military as a threat to peace , but much of the US public believing that US wars benefit people who are grateful for them .\nWe may begin to form some guesses as to how it is that people in the United States tolerate and even glorify endless mass-killing and destruction , support threatening to use or even using nuclear weapons , and suppose the US to have major enemies out there threatening its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War may not all immediately react with \u201c Holy shit !\nThe world must think we \u2019 re lunatics !\n\u201d But a few may ask themselves whether it \u2019 s possible that wars don \u2019 t look like they do in movies \u2014 and that would be a great start .\nTheaters of War ends with a recommendation , that movies be required to disclose at the start any military or CIA collaboration .\nThe film also notes that the United States has laws against propagandizing the US public , which might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crime .\nI would add that since 1976 , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights has required that \u201c Any propaganda for war shall be prohibited by law.\n\u201d David Swanson is an author , activist ,

than fascism disguised as tolerance\u2014has shifted us into an Age of Intolerance , policed by techno-censors , social media bullies , and government watchdogs .\nEverything is now fair game for censorship if it can be construed as hateful , hurtful , bigoted or offensive provided that it runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way , the most controversial issues of our day\u2014race , religion , sex , sexuality , politics , science , health , government corruption , police brutality , etc.\u2014have become battlegrounds for those who claim to believe in freedom of speech but only when it favors the views and positions they support .\n\u201c Free speech for me but not for thee \u201d is how my good friend and free speech purist Nat Hentoff used to sum up this double standard .\nThis tendency to censor , silence , delete , label @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewpoints that run counter to the cultural elite is being embraced with a near-fanatical zealotry by a cult-like establishment that values conformity and group-think over individuality .\nFor instance , are you skeptical about the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines ?\nDo you have concerns about the outcome of the 2020 presidential election ?\nDo you subscribe to religious beliefs that shape your views on sexuality , marriage and gender ?\nDo you , deliberately or inadvertently , engage in misgendering ( identifying a person \u2019 s gender incorrectly ) or deadnaming ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a transgender person ) ?\nSay yes to any of those questions and then dare to voice those views in anything louder than a whisper and you might find yourself suspended on Twitter , shut out of Facebook , and banned across various social media platforms .\nThis authoritarian intolerance masquerading as tolerance , civility and love ( what comedian George Carlin referred to as \u201c fascism pretending to be manners \u201d ) is the end result of a politically correct culture that has become radicalized , institutionalized and tyrannical .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prominent social media voices have been censored , silenced and made to disappear from Facebook , Twitter , YouTube and Instagram for voicing ideas that were deemed politically incorrect , hateful , dangerous or conspiratorial .\nMost recently , Twitter suspended conservative podcaster Matt Walsh for violating its hate speech policy by sharing his views about transgendered individuals .\n\u201c The greatest female Jeopardy champion of all time is a man .\nThe top female college swimmer is a man .\nThe first female four star admiral in the Public Health Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female high school track and the female MMA circuit .\nThe patriarchy wins in the end , \u201d Walsh tweeted on Dec. 30 , 2021 .\nJ.K. Rowling , author of the popular Harry Potter series , has found herself denounced as transphobic and widely shunned for daring to criticize efforts by transgender activists to erode the legal definition of sex and replace it with gender .\nRowling \u2019 s essay explaining her views is a powerful , articulate , well-researched piece that not only stresses the importance of free speech and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trans activists to demonize those who subscribe to \u201c wrongthink , \u201d but also recognizes that while the struggle over gender dysmorphia is real , concerns about safeguarding natal women and girls from abuse are also legitimate .\nIronically enough , Rowling \u2019 s shunning included literal book burning .\nYet as Ray Bradbury once warned , \u201c There is more than one way to burn a book .\nAnd the world is full of people running about with lit matches.\n\u201d Indeed , the First Amendment is going up in flames before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lit long ago and have been fed by intolerance all along the political spectrum .\nConsider some of the kinds of speech being targeted for censorship or outright elimination .\nOffensive , politically incorrect and \u201c unsafe \u201d speech : Political correctness has resulted in the chilling of free speech and a growing hostility to those who exercise their rights to speak freely .\nWhere this has become painfully evident is on college campuses , which have become hotbeds of student-led censorship , trigger warnings , microaggressions , and \u201c red light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause someone to feel uncomfortable , unsafe or offended .\nBullying , intimidating speech : Warning that \u201c school bullies become tomorrow \u2019 s hate crimes defendants , \u201d the Justice Department has led the way in urging schools to curtail bullying , going so far as to classify \u201c teasing \u201d as a form of \u201c bullying , \u201d and \u201c rude \u201d or \u201c hurtful \u201d \u201c text messages \u201d as \u201c cyberbullying.\n\u201d Hateful speech : Hate speech\u2014speech that attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , race , disability , or sexual orientation\u2014is the primary candidate for online censorship .\nCorporate internet giants Google , Twitter and Facebook continue to re-define what kinds of speech will be permitted online and what will be deleted .\nDangerous , anti-government speech : As part of its ongoing war on \u201c extremism , \u201d the government has partnered with the tech industry to counter online \u201c propaganda \u201d by terrorists hoping to recruit support or plan attacks .\nIn this way , anyone who criticizes the government online can be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported to government agencies for further investigation or deleted .\nIn fact , the Justice Department is planning to form a new domestic terrorism unit to ferret out individuals \u201c who seek to commit violent criminal acts in furtherance of domestic social or political goals.\n\u201d What this will mean is more surveillance , more pre-crime programs , and more targeting of individuals whose speech may qualify as \u201c dangerous.\n\u201d The upshot of all of this editing , parsing , banning and silencing is the emergence of a new language , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which places the power to control language in the hands of the totalitarian state .\nUnder such a system , language becomes a weapon to change the way people think by changing the words they use .\nThe end result is mind control and a sleepwalking populace .\nIn totalitarian regimes\u2014a.k.a .\npolice states\u2014where conformity and compliance are enforced at the end of a loaded gun , the government dictates what words can and can not be used .\nIn countries where the police state hides behind a benevolent mask and disguises itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , policing their words and thoughts to conform to the dictates of the mass mind lest they find themselves ostracized or placed under surveillance .\nEven when the motives behind this rigidly calibrated reorientation of societal language appear well-intentioned\u2014discouraging racism , condemning violence , denouncing discrimination and hatred\u2014inevitably , the end result is the same : intolerance , indoctrination and infantilism .\nThe social shunning favored by activists and corporations borrows heavily from the mind control tactics used by authoritarian cults as a means of controlling its members .\nAs Dr. Steven Hassan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordering members to be cut off , they can no longer participate .\nInformation and sharing of thoughts , feelings , and experiences are stifled .\nThought-stopping and use of loaded terms keep a person constrained into a black-and-white , all-or-nothing world .\nThis controls members through fear and guilt.\n\u201d This mind control can take many forms , but the end result is an enslaved , compliant populace incapable of challenging tyranny .\nAs Rod Serling , creator of The Twilight Zone , once observed , \u201c We \u2019 re developing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very selective about cereals and automobiles , but won \u2019 t be able to think.\n\u201d The problem as I see it is that we \u2019 ve allowed ourselves to be persuaded that we need someone else to think and speak for us .\nAnd we \u2019 ve bought into the idea that we need the government and its corporate partners to shield us from that which is ugly or upsetting or mean .\nThe result is a society in which we \u2019 ve stopped debating among ourselves , stopped thinking for ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix our own problems and resolve our own differences .\nIn short , we have reduced ourselves to a largely silent , passive , polarized populace incapable of working through our own problems and reliant on the government to protect us from our fears .\nAs Nat Hentoff , that inveterate champion of the First Amendment , once observed , \u201c The quintessential difference between a free nation , as we profess to be , and a totalitarian state , is that here everyone , including a foe of democracy , has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this means is opening the door to more speech not less , even if that speech is offensive to some .\nUnderstanding that freedom for those in the unpopular minority constitutes the ultimate tolerance in a free society , James Madison , the author of the Bill of Rights , fought for a First Amendment that protected the \u201c minority \u201d against the majority , ensuring that even in the face of overwhelming pressure , a minority of one\u2014even one who espouses distasteful viewpoints\u2014would still have the right to speak freely , pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government freely , and broadcast his views in the press freely .\nWe haven \u2019 t done ourselves\u2014or the nation\u2014any favors by becoming so fearfully polite , careful to avoid offense , and largely unwilling to be labeled intolerant , hateful or closed-minded that we \u2019 ve eliminated words , phrases and symbols from public discourse .\nWe have allowed our fears\u2014fear for our safety , fear of each other , fear of being labeled racist or hateful or prejudiced , etc.\u2014to trump our freedom of speech and muzzle us far more effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war on free speech\u2014and that \u2019 s exactly what it is : a war being waged by Americans against other Americans\u2014is a war that is driven by fear .\nBy bottling up dissent , we have created a pressure cooker of stifled misery and discontent that is now bubbling over and fomenting even more hate , distrust and paranoia among portions of the populace .\nBy muzzling free speech , we are contributing to a growing underclass of Americans who are being told that they can \u2019 t take part in American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d The First Amendment is a steam valve .\nIt allows people to speak their minds , air their grievances and contribute to a larger dialogue that hopefully results in a more just world .\nWhen there is no steam valve to release the pressure , frustration builds , anger grows , and people become more volatile and desperate to force a conversation .\nBe warned : whatever we

.\nThe problem is that they are clowns who don \u2019 t even realize they are clowns .\nThey are jokers who don \u2019 t see the joke is on us all .\nThe outdated institution of the presidency is mere puppetry at best and a slippery slope toward tyranny at worst .\nIt has become overtly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead patterns , it constantly gives birth to the two-faced bipartisan monstrosity of republican-democrat fuckery .\nThis is mostly due to a flawed voting system and a politically lazy citizenry .\nVoting in doesn \u2019 t work but voting out does .\nLottery in ; vote out\u2014that \u2019 s the golden ticket for appointing leadership .\nBut we \u2019 re putting the cart before the horse .\nFirst , we need to get the horse in front of the cart , and that \u2019 s getting rid of the presidency and replacing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can begin instituting a new system of appointing leadership .\nThe reasons are inexhaustible , but here are seven major reasons why we do not need a president : 2 . )\nIt aggrandizes the outdated , misguided , and corrupt power of the state .\n3 . )\nIt leads to an apathetic citizenry .\n7 . )\nIt is not democratic .\nBut these are not the worst offense to democracy .\nThe worst offense is that the presidency itself is nothing more than a red herring .\nThis alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing .\nWhat is a red herring ?\nIt \u2019 s a diversion intended to distract attention from the real issue .\nIt \u2019 s an abstract issue having only surface relevance to the original issue .\nGoverning this precept , it stands to reason that the concept of the presidency\u2014like the parochial and uncouth establishment of kings and queens that came before it\u2014is itself a red herring .\nIt has become a smokescreen , a false sincerity , a diversionary device .\nAs it stands , the presidency distracts us from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pageantry and no payoff .\nThey are dangerous debacles to the right and laughable identity politics to the left .\nThey exhaust themselves in howls .\nThe issues that concern us all are tossed around like smoke and mirrors while the clowns and jokers strut across the stage making a mockery of liberty .\nAnd we \u2019 re all tuned in .\nWe \u2019 re all on the edge of our seat , hoodwinked , conned , bamboozled .\nIn a cruel twist of irony these red herrings flip the tables on us\u2014we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinker , we fall for their tricks .\nMoney gets tossed in to muddy the waters .\nThis happens again and again .\nAnd we \u2019 re all caught in the downward spiral of plutocracy disguised as democracy .\nWe fall for the partisan trap , year in and year out .\nOur political indoctrination blinds us to the big picture .\nAll we see is the red clown and the blue joker .\nAll we feel is us versus them .\nAll we think is we \u2019 re right and they \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we don \u2019 t know that we don \u2019 t know what \u2019 s happening .\nOur willful ignorance becomes our cognitive dissonance and before we know it all our reasoning gives way to delusion .\nThe specter rules the spectator .\nThere is a way out , but it will take a leap of courage out of the faith that we have in our political views .\nIt will take detachment from our political indoctrination .\nIt will take un-washing the partisan brainwash .\nIt will take questioning what we think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it will take reconditioning our cultural conditioning .\nThe best way to do this is to think outside the box .\nThe current \u201c box \u201d has us conditioned to believe that we need a president .\nThinking outside this box asks the radical question : do we really even need a president ?\nWe need leaders ( plural ) not figureheads ( singular ) : To piggyback on Jordan Peterson \u2019 s quote , it \u2019 s also to the degree that the individual is deceived and conditioned into being irresponsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so distracted by the red herring ( whoever it may be ) , that we deceive ourselves into giving up our responsibility to their abstract and wishy-washy \u201c leadership.\n\u201d Under the shadow of our partisan specter , we lose sight of our personal responsibility to liberty .\nIt \u2019 s all too easy to just give into the easy but flawed way of appointing leaders : voting .\nTo elect means \u201c to choose or make a decision.\n\u201d The problem is our choices are limited due to the bi-partisan monopoly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be between a \u201c greater or lesser evil.\n\u201d This is perpetuated by state manipulation , cultural conditioning , and entrenched political propaganda with corrupt lobbying that creates divisiveness .\nBut there is a third option .\nWe can \u201c elect \u201d to think outside the ballot box .\nWe can \u201c elect \u201d to take money out of politics .\nWe can \u201c elect \u201d to have a complete system reboot , to include , especially , the electoral system .\nWe can \u201c elect \u201d to implement a sortition system that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders and prestigious elders and votes-out bad leaders .\nWe can \u201c elect \u201d to devise a system that uses impeachment more often than it uses aggrandizement .\nIndeed .\nWe can \u201c elect \u201d to not elect a president at all , because we don \u2019 t need a scapegoat-puppet who is hamstrung by lobbyists , corporations , and bankers for a \u201c leader.\n\u201d We don \u2019 t need a plutocrat propped up by money and monopoly .\nWe just need authentic leaders and prestigious elders\u2014plural ; chosen randomly from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prestigious elders .\nThat will get the job done just fine , while also preventing scapegoating and the rise of psychopaths .\nThis article is ahead of its time .\nIt \u2019 s in the future .\nIt \u2019 s ahead of the curve .\nBut the fact that people aren \u2019 t ready for it , or that the system is simply too set in its ways to change , does not change the fact that bottom-up assemblies function better than top-down hierarchies .\nSub-hierarchies within bottom-up assemblies may work because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut top-down hierarchy in and of themselves tend to not work because even the most well-meaning person can become corrupt by power .\nTherefore , we don \u2019 t need a president with power , we need a presidential assembly that understands the nature of power .\nA presidential assembly , made up of three or five individuals , will be more likely to check and balance each other \u2019 s power and it will dissolve the symbolism of the \u201c crowned \u201d figurehead , replacing it with a balanced team .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a split-second decision can be regulated to the presidential speaker ( similar to the Speaker of the House in the House of Representatives ) , which can be randomly decided by lot each new day , week , or month .\nSome might argue that the House and the Senate are already a fair enough checks and balancing system on presidential power , but this still doesn \u2019 t solve the red herring problem that hijacks our reasoning .\nNor does it solve the partisan bias problem .\nNeither does it solve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ randomly created through a lottery of existing leaders can solve both the electoral corruption problem and the red herring problem that we all face in our country \u2019 s leadership .\nTo begin with\u2014since we are living in the time of partisan delusion and one-right-way thinking\u2014 we \u2019 ll need to make sure the assembly is well balanced .\nPerhaps a three-to-two republican-to-democrat ratio , and vice versa , to begin with .\nOr a republican , democrat , green party member , libertarian , anarchist dynamic that covers more of the existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years .\nAnd We the People can still have voting powers throughout the assemblies \u201c reign.\n\u201d Not by voting in .\nNo .\nBy voting out !\nImpeachment over aggrandizement .\nWe default to aggressive checks-and-balances by democracy and liberty rather than the passive prop-and-stay of plutocracy and monopoly .\nThe beauty of this system is that it takes money out of politics , and it will eventually blur the line between red and blue .\nInstead of only clowns or jokers , we can eventually get creators and liberators .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ can eventually get mastery and prestige .\nInstead of the song and dance of red herrings , we can eventually get the harmony and

Meaning of Life and Death Get the latest Waking Times articles delivered to your inbox .\nSign up here .\nWe need to redefine the meaning of life and death .\nRe-examine the true significance of their power within our day to day activities on this ever generous planet Earth .\nBecause that significance has been almost entirely lost .\nLet \u2019 s take Life as our starting point , because we are ( most of us ) participants in life , so it makes sense to consider what it \u2018 is \u2019 to be alive .\nWell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious ; it \u2019 s the opposite of being dead.\n\u201d However we can \u2019 t know this unless we have experienced \u2018 being dead \u2019 .\nWe can \u2019 t assume that \u2018 to be dead \u2019 is the opposite of \u2018 to be alive \u2019 .\nWe can only safely say that the human body , nerves and brain have ceased to function ; while when one is alive , they do function .\nBut when we set life and death in the greater context of existence \u2013 in the macrocosmic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a completely different dimension emerges .\nSuddenly \u2018 life \u2019 means something dynamic that is moving , exploring , creating , evolving .\nWhereas \u2018 death \u2019 alludes to the lack of these qualities , their non-existence .\nTo be alive , in the mostly three dimensional earthly sense of this experience , is to feel the emotions of love , happiness , joy as well as pain , sadness and various other forms of sensitivity .\nWhereas Life , in the deeper/broader holistic meaning of this word , covers the whole spectrum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full flow .\nThe true expression of cosmic consciousness taking form as the vast myriad of exigencies that constitute the sum total of all that \u2018 IS \u2019 .\nSo if this omnipotent exigence is \u2018 Life \u2019 what can death be ?\nOnce again , explored on the broad cosmic level/dimension , death \u2013 defined as a lack of the exigences described above \u2013 has no meaning .\nSince the great cycle that we call life contains within it the process of decay , transformation and rebirth .\nThey are integral to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not describe \u2018 the lack \u2019 or non-existence of all this , since that implies a state of absolute void .\nWas there ever a state of absolute void ?\nA state of total \u2018 non-existence \u2019 ?\nWe can conclude that death does not actually exist , because there can be no opposite of life once we recognise that the life process simply integrates dying as a phase of living \u2013 not as its opposite \u2013 not as an end to life .\nThus the cosmic truth reveals itself .\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no death .\nThe concept \u2018 death \u2019 was invented so as to cause fear and to thereby facilitate control .\nAbsolute control .\nNow I \u2019 m going to bring us back to earth , whose evolution has been entrusted in our hands .\nWe are trustees of this planet , gifted this role by the Supreme Creator .\nHere on earth , a condition that fits the common but false understanding of the word \u2018 death \u2019 , does exist .\nIt is a distortion \u2013 a reversal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , recognises \u2018 passing \u2019 as a phase of life , not as a \u2018 lifeless \u2019 condition .\nThe green leaves of Spring turn brown and fall to the ground in Autumn , enriching the soil in which their seeds will sprout again during the following Spring .\nThis is the life cycle in action .\nUniversal , eternal and always in transformative movement .\nBut a large number of people have displayed blindness to this truth and have unquestioningly accepted the opposite state of affairs .\nThe completely illogical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution of our spirit/soul upon transitioning beyond the aged body .\nNo transformation of the autumn leaves into fecund soil .\nEven if we can see it happening in our own garden compost heap , most can \u2019 t recognise this life cycle as a mirror of our own soul \u2019 s transformative evolutionary onward voyage .\nIt is because of this same blindness that we accept being governed by those totally unfit to govern .\nOur failure to accept \u2013 and recognise \u2013 our own lives as mirrors of universal life causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reality .\nA version now imprisoning much of humanity in a web of deception about the true nature of reality .\nThus we choose leaders who have no qualities of leadership .\nThose who do not in any way represent the \u2018 living universe \u2019 \u2013 but something else .\nSomething totally lacking the vibrant energy and higher aspiration which is the true hallmark of being \u2018 alive \u2019 .\nSo it seems that after all there is something which fits the description of death .\nSomething that is not alive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were .\nThis is a strange phenomenon .\nHere we have something that actually fits the criteria of being \u2018 dead \u2019 .\nThe only thing in the universe that I can qualify as fitting this description : joyless , emotionless , soul-less \u2013 yet existing \u2013 and having the general outward appearance of a living human being .\nWhat is this creature ?\nA creature for which ego is all and all is ego \u2013 which believes that life belongs to it \u2013 not that it belongs to life .\nThis entity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity today ; and it has the ambition to turn all life into a replica of its own state of cyborgian numbness .\nTo rid itself , and the rest of humanity , of any vestige of the life-force \u2013 of Life \u2013 is its unbending ambition .\nHumans have been allowing such a diabolical ambition to play an ever more influential role in setting the direction of life on earth .\nWe humans have been taking instruction from the dead .\nWe have mistakenly thought that the dead are alive .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haven \u2019 t yet experienced \u2018 life \u2019 in its fullness \u2013 as it is \u2013 and therefore don \u2019 t recognise the difference between themselves and those who manifest an anti-life , demonic state of existence .\nHumanity is learning this lesson the hard way .\nThe demonic is amongst us right now , on the surface , in full view .\nIt expresses itself as \u2018 Covid \u2019 which has people wrapped in fear .\nIts close cohorts on earth turn up the volume so that the fear becomes \u2018 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this death/fear vibration .\nThen the silent weapons , devised and designed by the anti-life element , are deployed to play their role in the anti-life depopulation agenda .\nBut life is unvanquishable .\nWhen ignored and spurned for decade after decade it finally reveals to its sleeping subjects exactly what their continual ignoring of it is doing .\nIt manifests the divine shock doctrine !\nThe Covid demons , it reveals , are sleeping man \u2019 s own invention .\nThe anti-life fake leaders who push-on with their \u2018 new variants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the ghouls that emerge to show humanity what its denial status actually makes manifest .\nAnd how things will only get worse until it sees the error of its ways and wakes up out of its self inflicted nightmare .\nTo put an end to the parade of death , humanity will have to learn to recognise the difference between truth and lie , between reality and deception .\nAnd realise that by following the lie for decade after decade after decade , it caused that lie to physically manifest itself right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now humanity is finally witnessing \u2013 emerging out of all the main institutions of governance on this planet \u2013 exactly what their largely selfish , self centred materialistic life-style has made manifest .\nTruth is an uncompromising actor .\nIf one won \u2019 t learn by choice , one will have to learn the hard way .\nHere we are .\nA core element of humanity is on the brink of absorbing this cardinal truth , thereby acquiring the wisdom necessary to alter the entire trajectory of this planet and beyond .\nAn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his creator and blow the demons into the furthest depths of the universe .\nIt behoves us , the trustees of life on earth , to grasp this truth and to thereby trigger this great tipping-point .\nThe event so profoundly anticipated by all who have \u2013 against the odds \u2013 understood and nurtured the great gift of Life .\nIn this essay I have tried to show how what \u2019 s commonly \u2013 and wrongly \u2013 called \u2018 death \u2019 is not an ending of our existence , because there is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : our soul \u2018 I \u2019 .\nOur \u2018 soul I \u2019 is something which emerges in us once \u2018 ego \u2019 is finally given a back seat .\nIn answering the question \u201c What is death ?\n\u201d I conclude that it uniquely applies to those expressing an anti-life position in all words and actions .\nThe true opposition to the flowering of humanity .\nBy transforming the dominating power of the ego , and by acting according to the direction uniquely provided by that force called \u2018 intuition \u2019 , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of all life can be cemented .\nThe one event which will finally open us to the fullness of creation and bring into true perspective the meaning of the word \u2018 life \u2019 and of the verb

seems as though society today has lost track of how these people can sabotage the core fabric of a civilization or nation .\nIt is very easy to hyper-focus on collectivist ideologies as the source of our problems and forget that these ideologies do not function in a vacuum ; they can not wreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people directing them to do real damage .\nThere is something about collectivism that lends itself to projection and hypocrisy ( collectivism is organization by FORCE instead of being voluntary ) .\nI suppose when your political ideology becomes your religion it \u2019 s easy to turn into a zealot .\nAnd while zealots find power in their single-mindedness and their cultism they also tend to lack any self-awareness .\nThey literally go insane with devotion to their cause to the point that they lose track of whether or not their cause is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly erratic and disjointed and every person they run into that does not share their views is immediately seen as a heretical enemy that needs to be exposed or destroyed .\nTo outsiders looking in , zealots are an endless source of comedy .\nYou can \u2019 t help but laugh because their ticks and cricks and outbursts are nonsensical and absurd ( just check out \u201c Libs Of Tik Tok \u201d for a mountain of examples ) .\nAs long as they don \u2019 t have any real power these people act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings abandon reason for madness .\nThey can be frightening but they serve the purposes of entertainment as well as keeping the rest of us grounded .\nWhen they do gain power , however , that \u2019 s when things stop being funny .\nCivilizations throughout history have consistently dealt with the problem of zealots , but the greater threat is the existence of narcissists and psychopaths sneaking into positions of authority and encouraging zealotry among the masses .\nGenerally , psychopaths are seen as an anomaly which is quickly identified and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing too high up the ladder of social influence .\nThe problem is they are not as rare as one might hope and many of them have the ability to hide among the herd .\nAround 1 % of any given population is made up of psychopaths while another 1 % are sociopaths .\nAround 5 % of people are identified as having narcissistic traits .\nNarcissists are self-absorbed and view themselves as superior to everyone else \u2013 They believe they are entitled to adoration and authority .\nSociopaths have an inability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them impractical as leaders .\nPsychopaths also exhibit a lack of empathy but also have a propensity for emotional or physical violence .\nThey take joy in the suffering of others and perpetrate a large number of violent crimes .\nEven though psychopaths are 1 % of the population , they make up 15 % to 25 % of those incarcerated in prisons .\nThe drag they exert on society can not be overstated .\nThere is definitely some overlap among the various types , but in general close to 10 % of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological malfunctions that are often not treatable .\nThink about that for a moment \u2013 10 out of every 100 people are ticking time bombs waiting to make life miserable for the rest of us .\nTo be sure , some of them are still able to function in society .\nSociopaths in particular can become valuable in fields where less empathy is required in order to accomplish certain tasks .\nThey are particularly well suited as surgeons , EMTs , soldiers , firefighters , and any other job where seeing people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from accomplishing their task .\nThey don \u2019 t necessarily take joy in seeing others harmed , but they aren \u2019 t emotionally fazed by it either .\nAs long as they are never allowed into positions of influence over large groups of people they can serve some good for the public .\nHistory shows us that vetting and preventing psychologically broken individuals from slipping into institutions that offer power is not so easy .\nIn fact , many monarchies and empires were built on systems that allowed psychopaths and narcissists to flourish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a monarch had a son who was predisposed to psychopathy it did not matter , that crazed prince would one day become a king and there was little that could be done about it .\nThere was no vetting process .\nAlso , many such traits are passed on genetically , which means a power structure built on heredity could become progressively more destructive as psychopaths in royalty intermarry .\nThis would help explain why psychopathic behavior is over-represented among monarchs of the past .\nThe creation of democracy and democratic republics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out aberrant individuals by using open elections and the voting process .\nIn other words , let the people scrutinize candidates and remove the crazies from circles of power .\nUnfortunately , this doesn \u2019 t work too well if ALL the candidates are psychopaths and the public has no real choice .\nBy extension , psychopaths have also found ways to circumvent the political process and control it without directly participating in it .\nThe corporate world and financial institutions allow psychopaths to influence politics from behind the curtain , buying off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ONLY allowing those with similar sociopathic , narcissistic and psychopathic habits through the selection process and into the political arena .\nIn tribal societies and in smaller low-tech societies the ability to identify and root out psychologically broken individuals and prevent them from becoming leaders was easier .\nIn the midst of vast empires and technocracy it is much simpler for psychopaths to hide among normal people and blend in .\nI usually compare invasive psychopaths to mythological stories of vampires for this reason .\nI really can \u2019 t think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a population , take up positions of influence which protect them from suspicion and then systematically bleed the town dry .\nThis is what they do .\nIt is in their nature and they can not be fixed , they can only be removed as a parasite is removed from host .\nThese people are the top threats to any given civilization .\nThey are moderators of chaos and they actively conspire to supplant free society .\nThey are what I would call primary organized psychopaths and they do indeed work together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack of wolves .\nThey represent the 1 % of the 1 % ( i.e .\nthe globalists ) .\nPsychopaths at the top of the pyramid have been organized for a long time , but what about the millions of other people out there with such traits ?\nWhat happens when they are given a way to congregate ?\nModern society and Big Tech social media have created even worse circumstances because now the greater psychopathic community is no longer isolated .\nThe 1 % that used to be mostly relegated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now able to organize into aggressive mobs of hundreds of thousands , leading millions of lesser sociopaths and narcissists .\nThis is creating a subculture of what I would call communal insanity \u2013 As the old saying goes , the patients are taking over the asylum .\nWe see this specifically with the political left and the open promotion of narcissism as an acceptable way of life .\nThis is not to say that psychopaths don \u2019 t try to infiltrate conservative circles as well , only that leftists are much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who once felt powerless because they were shunned and now they want revenge .\nThe thing is , they were originally shunned from influence for a very good reason ; they are not psychologically equipped to handle any measure of power .\nNow they are being handed institutional control and they are being whipped into a frothing frenzy .\nThey see themselves as the underdogs and the \u201c revolutionaries

longer term ?\nOur culture has to be fundamentally changed with psychopathy and other aberrant traits in mind .\nWe can no longer ignore the effect these people have on humanity as a whole .\nThe first step would require separation from movements and institutions that promote psychopathic and narcissistic behaviors .\nIn other words , we need to return to a model of isolation for the psychopathically inclined instead of treating them as if they are some kind of victim status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurturing.\n\u201d As noted , in many cases these characteristics are inherent ( inborn ) and can not be treated .\nThere is no fixing the problem because it is not so much an illness as it is a completely different psychological structure .\nThey might as well be a different species , and a predatory one at that .\nThere is no mutual coexistence with them .\nThey see us as food .\nCandidates for positions of authority would have to be screened for psychopathy , narcissism and sociopathy .\nIf they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then they should not be allowed to pursue those jobs .\nThis is the only answer beyond fundamentally changing the way our election system functions , which I \u2019 m not necessarily opposed to either .\nA random lottery system for government jobs along with strict term limits ( not just for normal political positions but also in bureaucratic positions ) would at least be better than what we have now .\nI would rather risk the possibility of less qualified people being randomly chosen for government than have a system that attracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What better way to discourage psychopaths than to take away any long-term benefits of working in government ?\nWhat better way to disrupt the influence of corporate elitists than to take away their ability to finance or choose the candidates that end up in office ?\nAnd even if they were able to buy off some officials , with term limits they would have to start over and over again with the latest crop of new officials .\nSome will of course point out that changing the system tomorrow will require getting rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI agree , it \u2019 s a dilemma .\nSadly , once psychopaths become organized and entrenched history tells us they will not be moved without the force of violence .\nThey don \u2019 t care about protests , they are not moved by reason or logic , they don \u2019 t care about the suffering of the masses and they will always see themselves as the rightful rulers of us \u201c lesser \u201d peasants .\nThey derive supremacy from the mobs of the stunted that they lead and exploit ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when organized becomes an army of raging mad hatters hungry for scraps from the table of power .\nWe can and should continue to separate from the collectivist mob and the zealots , but all psychopaths view separation as defiance and will try to interfere .\nEventually there \u2019 s going to be a fight , and maybe that \u2019 s for the best .\nBrandon Smith writes for

must be willing to lose everything .\nBut the opposite of this may also be true : To conquer everything , we must be willing to surrender ourselves to fate .\nAs Niels Bohr suggested , \u201c The opposite of one profound truth may very well be another profound truth.\n\u201d Inside our fate ( on the inside looking out ) , we must be willing to lose everything to make a dent , to self-improve , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our fate ( on the outside looking in ) , we must be willing to lose our ego \u2019 s attachment to how things turn out .\nMaybe we made a dent , maybe not .\nMaybe we improved ourselves , maybe not .\nMaybe we individuated , maybe not .\nMaybe we became enlightened , but probably not .\nAnd that \u2019 s okay .\nThe journey is the thing , not the destination .\nThat \u2019 s the epitome of amor fati ( love of fate ) : To fall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chips fall where they may .\nIf the chips should fall in favor of triumph and fortune , so be it , enjoy it , make the best of it , use it as fuel to continue the journey .\nIf the chips should fall out of favor and lead you into tragedy and misfortune , so be it , make the best of it , use it as fuel to continue the journey .\nAmor fati is vital for the individuated person seeking interdependence and self-overcoming ; first , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside looking out ) , and second , through the soul-centric will to surrender ( on the outside looking in ) .\nFrom this state of surrender , we are free to re-condition cultural conditioning .\nWe are free to take destiny into our own hands .\nBeing-in-fate trumps being-in-itself .\nAmor fati becomes fuel for the fire for a life well-lived .\nFear-filled blue pills get swapped out for wisdom-filled red pills as we creatively and imaginatively transcend whatever condition we may find ourselves in .\nThrough our healthy detachment we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached .\nInside fate , we are free to write our own story despite all the other stories crashing into each other on the superhighway of the human leitmotif .\nOutside fate , we are free to love how the story has turned out so far despite our expectations or the expectations of others .\nOnce we realize the extraordinary power of surrender , we \u2019 ll move from passive , conditioned thinking to being a proactive co-creator of fate .\nWe \u2019 ll become more likely to transform a hardship into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wakeup .\nAs Ludwig Wittgenstein said , \u201c We are asleep .\nOur Life is a dream .\nBut we wake up sometimes , just enough to know that we are dreaming.\n\u201d This is the sacred state of being-in-fate .\nBeing-in-fate keeps us flexible in the face of unexpected change .\nWe must be pliant to destiny and vicissitude , not merely compliant to \u201c rules \u201d and cultural norms .\nThis requires vulnerability and deep questioning .\nIt requires gratitude and radical forgiveness .\nBut most of all it requires courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are more likely to seize the day .\nCarpe punctum ( seize the moment ) leads to carpe diem ( seize the day ) leads to carpe vita ( seize the life ) leads to carpe fati ( seize fate ) .\nWhen we seize fate , we are on the outside looking in .\nWith a bird \u2019 s eye view , we are able to see the chalk line of our fate .\nFrom this vantage point we can manifest potential .\nWe may not be able to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can narrow down a few and focus on pulling ourselves closer to them .\nWhen we seize our fate , we are oriented to process rather than outcome .\nBut there \u2019 s nothing preventing us from making lofty goals ( self-actualization , enlightenment ) a part of that process .\nShould we fall short , oh well , the process continues .\nShould we always fall short , oh well , the journey was the thing .\nAt least we tried .\nSeizing fate is all about embracing our inner gardener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-improvement , our hope , or what we wish to achieve .\nThe soil is fate , which we do not have control over .\nBut that \u2019 s okay because there are things that we do have control over .\nLike how much we \u201c water \u201d ( cultivate and pay attention to ) our seeds .\nDon \u2019 t worry if the seeds take root or not .\nDon \u2019 t worry that they may get dug up by unforeseen circumstances .\nDon \u2019 t worry if there will or will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow .\nThat \u2019 s neither here or nor there .\nRight now , it \u2019 s all about planting the seeds .\nThe action of planting a seed trumps what becomes of the seed .\nProcess trumps outcome .\nJourney trumps destination .\nSometimes , usually , fate is out of our hands .\nAnd that \u2019 s okay .\nThere \u2019 s more to being human than choice , there \u2019 s vicissitude .\nHuman flourishing , Eudaimonia , doesn \u2019 t just happen .\nIt takes work .\nIt takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tears .\nAnd even then , sometimes it won \u2019 t be enough .\nBut it will have been enough that you focused on process over outcome .\nIt will have been enough that you allowed the journey to be the thing .\nWhen we seize fate , we are open to the call of Kairos \u2018 the right time \u2019 .\nKairos is begging us to seize the day .\nKairos is calling us to adventure .\nIt foreshadows shadow integration .\nIt \u2019 s a wolf howling in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our all-too-comfortable shoreline .\nKairos is a wakeup call .\nIt is the cataclysmic confrontation between the all-too-comfortable ego and the realization that \u201c time makes ancient good uncouth \u201d ( James Russel Lowell ) .\nAs Paul Tillich said , \u201c There are moments in which Kairos \u2018 the right time \u2019 is united with logos , \u2018 the eternal truth \u2019 , and in which the fate of philosophy is decided for a special period.\n\u201d When we are being-in-fate , we are allowing a higher probability for this sacred alignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart up to Fate , we go beyond right and wrong , beyond good and evil , beyond black and white , beyond life and death .\nWe are able to dance between summit and abyss .\nDestiny itself becomes our God .\nFull surrender .\nFull disclosure .\nFull of courage and vulnerability despite vicissitude , we learn how to improvise , how to adapt and overcome .\nFate is a fickle beast .\nWe should learn to love her anyway .\nThe more we embrace her , the more likely she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , the more likely she is to dig her claws into our reluctance and drag us away kicking and screaming .\nAs Seneca said , \u201c Fate leads the willing and drags along the reluctant.\n\u201d As such , a painful life should not be avoided at the expense of love .\nLove should be embraced at the risk of a painful life .\nSeizing fate teaches us how to roll with the punches .\nIt teaches us the high honor of humility and humor .\nIt teaches us how to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall in love with the adventure being the thing .\nIn the end , life is less about what we want and more about making the best of what we get .\nMaking the best of what we get is falling in love with Fate .\nGary \u2018 Z \u2019 McGee , a former Navy Intelligence Specialist turned philosopher , is the author of Birthday Suit of God

policies has drawn more than 40 million views on Joe Rogan \u2019 s podcast \u2013 told WND in a video interview Thursday night the official pandemic narrative that has been fiercely guarded by establishment media and social-media censors is \u201c completely crumbling.\n\u201d That narrative , he said , included \u201c false statements regarding asymptomatic spread , reliance on lockdown and masks \u2013 which obviously didn \u2019 t work \u2013 the suppression of early treatment , the mass promotion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here we are , almost in complete free fall , \u201d McCullough said , referring to the record number of COVID-19 cases as officials acknowledge the vaccines don \u2019 t prevent infection or transmission .\nMcCullough noted that in California , with the more contagious but much milder omicron variant now dominant , health care workers who tested positive for COVID-19 and had symptoms were told to go back to work .\nThe focus , he said , should be on \u201c treating high-risk patients who develop symptoms \u201d with some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the world have found to be effective , including ivermectin and a new drug granted emergency use authorization by the FDA , Paxlovid .\nMcCullough cited a study from Denmark and data from the U.K. \u2019 s health agency showing that the vaccines have zero effectiveness against omicron .\nCompleting this poll entitles you to WND news updates free of charge .\nYou may opt out at anytime .\nYou also agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\nPresident Biden clearly had McCullough in mind when on Thursday he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to \u201c please deal with the misinformation and disinformation that \u2019 s on your shows .\nIt has to stop.\n\u201d McCullough pointed out his work has been relied upon by courts across the nation , including the U.S. Supreme Court , and he has testified to the U.S. Senate and will be back there later this month .\nIn the half-hour video interview with WND ( embedded below ) , McCullough also discussed : \u2022 The punishment of physicians who counter the official COVID narrative and use clinically indicated , FDA-approved drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients , including a colleague in Maine whose was ordered to undergo a psychological examination after her license was suspended ; \u2022 His participation in a rally in Washington , D.C. , on Jan.

backfired , making the pandemic worse in nations with high vaccine intake ; \u2022 The lethality of the mRNA vaccines ; \u2022 His take on new FDA-approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-the-counter protocol for treating omicron ; \u2022 The unwillingness of so many doctors to \u201c come off the sidelines \u201d and treat patients for COVID-19 ; \u2022 The \u201c crisis of competence \u201d among top government health officials ; \u2022 Where to find resources and support for physicians and patients , and for employees confronting mandates .\n\u201c I think Americans are going to understand that their individual choice is really what \u2019 s going to matter in the end , \u201d he McCullough told WND in conclusion .\n\u201c If Americans decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take any boosters or any more vaccines , it doesn \u2019 t matter how many mandates or how many court decisions that happen .\nThe vaccine program is going to crumble .\nI think it \u2019 s just a matter of saying no.\n\u201d He emphasized that the vaccines are still \u201c research.\n\u201d \u201c No one can be forced into it , \u201d he said of vaccination .\n\u201c And they \u2019 re not turning out to be safe or effective .\nSo , if everybody just stands firm and declines the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quickest way for us to get out of this.\n\u201d See the WND interview with Dr. Peter McCullough : McCullough , in a video interview with WND in December , called for a \u201c pivot \u201d from the current policies to early treatment and \u201c compassionate care \u201d for those who have COVID or have suffered vaccine injuries , which have included myocarditis , neurological issues and blood clotting .\n\u201c Now is the time for doctors to step up .\nNow is not a time for rhetoric or harsh statements regarding @ @

October and early November , the self-serving members of two committees advising the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) without a second thought endorsed experimental COVID vaccines for children as young as 5 years old .\nIgnoring the 99.995 % COVID survival rate for those age 17 and under , the 31 pharma-servile \u201c experts \u201d also appeared unconcerned by reams of damning data about COVID-vaccine-related disabilities and fatalities already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary tragedies being acknowledged that very instant in a panel discussion convened by U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson ( R-Wis. ) .\nPredictably , adverse event data and urgent frontline healthcare provider testimony began pouring in almost immediately after the FDA-CDC go-ahead , with 5- to 11-year-olds experiencing the same kinds of \u201c terrifying \u201d vaccine reactions as adolescents \u2014 including blood clots , strokes and other brain and heart problems previously almost unheard-of in young people .\nIn the lead-up to the FDA \u2019 s Emergency Use Authorization of experimental COVID jabs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school districts also started to grease the skids to mandate COVID injections for in-person school attendance .\nTo date , the number of states and school systems announcing or adopting coercive plans , either for K-12 students or students ages 12 or 16 and up , is still small .\nHowever , the symbolic weight of the \u201c early adopters \u201d is significant .\nThese include states like California and Louisiana ( and soon New York ) ; major cities like Washington , D.C. ( and probably New York City ) ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oakland , California , and Los Angeles .\nIn addition , the New York City and Washington , D.C. school districts , and some or all districts in California , Hawaii and Maryland , require students involved in sports and other extracurricular activities to get jabbed .\nIn what sounds like good news , the National Academy for State Health Policy ( NASHP ) confirmed 17 states \u2014 Alabama , Arizona , Arkansas , Florida , Georgia , Idaho , Indiana , Kansas , Montana , New Hampshire , Ohio , Oklahoma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Texas and Utah \u2014 have enacted laws or issued executive orders that ban COVID-19 vaccine mandates for students .\nHowever , most of the bans are limited to certain circumstances , with some applying only to higher education and some only to vaccines authorized under emergency use \u2014 meaning the ban would not apply to COVID vaccines that in the future gain full FDA approval for children .\nFor decades , vaccines have been wreaking havoc on children \u2019 s health .\nFor instance , consider the following : \u2022 The 400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of licensed childhood vaccines \u2022 The epidemic of chronic health problems in American children \u2014 including 1 in 16 boys with autism in California , the state with the highest autism rate in the nation \u2022 The precipitous decline in sudden infant deaths that coincided with the disruption of \u201c routine \u201d vaccination during the 2020 lockdowns .\n\u2022 The superior health of far less heavily vaccinated Japanese children .\nSo , when observers familiar with COVID injection data pronounce them \u201c the most dangerous vaccines in human history , \u201d that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the COVID jabs are setting up children for \u201c potentially lifelong health problems , \u201d including serious heart problems resulting from myocarditis .\nAs he wrote in early January : \u201c [ T ] he recent push to inject children with a genetic experiment may be one of the worst public health offenses perpetrated on a population of people who are unable to speak for themselves , do not have a legal voice and depend on adults to protect them.\n\u201d Not content with those assaults on health freedom , Gov .\nGavin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading the minds , weeks in advance , of the FDA and CDC committee members who subsequently rubber-stamped the COVID shots for 5- to 11-year-olds \u2014 that his state would impose a K-12 mandate in both public and private schools , making California the first state to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for in-person school attendance .\nThe mandate hinges on the vaccines \u201c receiving full licensure from the FDA for children , \u201d which the state expects in July 2022 .\nSeeking to normalize his COVID mandate , Newsom compared it to the existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubella ( MMR ) vaccination .\nHowever , in light of the strong , statistically significant relationship between MMR vaccines and autism \u2014 and given California \u2019 s status as the state with the highest autism prevalence \u2014 Newsom \u2019 s comparison is scarcely reassuring .\nIn mid-December , Louisiana Gov .\nJohn Bel Edwards added COVID vaccines to the list of required school shots , overturning a bipartisan vote against such a mandate by the state \u2019 s House Health and Welfare Committee .\nThe push for the mandate originated with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Committee then voted 13-2 to reject the department \u2019 s recommendation , stating that COVID vaccination \u201c should be the parents \u2019 decision , \u201d a common-sense view shared by legislators and parents around the nation .\nHowever , the governor vetoed the committee vote \u2014 and the wishes of citizens who packed the committee meeting to protest mandates \u2014 dismissively characterizing their objections as \u201c overheated rhetoric.\n\u201d Louisiana \u2019 s governor and health officials also ignored remarks delivered at the health committee hearing by experienced Louisiana nurse Collette Martin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adverse reactions in children and their widespread underreporting .\nShe told the committee : \u201c We are not just seeing severe acute reactions with this vaccine , but we have zero idea what any long-term reactions are .\nCancers , autoimmune [ disorders ] , infertility .\nWe just don \u2019 t know.\n\u201d Louisiana \u2019 s mandate , which goes into effect in fall 2022 , currently applies only to students ages 16 and up , \u201c but could expand as the vaccines get the highest level of approval \u201d from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House Press Secretary Jen Psaki asserted that decisions on school vaccine mandates \u201c are up to local school districts.\n\u201d However , the U.S. Department of Education has been working with school districts , Psaki said , \u201c to provide resources , connect school officials with testing providers , and set up vaccine clinics\u2026.\n\u201d Last September , Maryland \u2019 s health secretary disingenuously made similar comments , telling the press that the state prefers \u201c not to be intentionally overbearing \u201d or \u201c interventionist \u201d and instead encourages school systems \u201c to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d In California , school board members in several large school districts showed , as early as September , they were willing to \u201c take the lead \u201d in imposing mandates for in-person instruction .\nThe plans of school boards in Los Angeles ( the nation \u2019 s second-largest school district ) , Oakland and San Diego have been undermined , however , by the large number of unvaccinated students and other apparently unforeseen pitfalls .\nThe Los Angeles school district , for example , pushed back its initial Jan. 10 deadline to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thousands of uninjected students would have \u201c overwhelmed the district \u2019 s independent study program.\n\u201d L.A. students ages 12 and up are supposed to upload proof of vaccination into a \u201c Daily Pass \u201d system .\nThe L.A. district already requires students to undergo weekly testing ( regardless of vaccination status ) and subjects them to other measures such as \u201c daily health checks , \u201d masking and contact tracing and isolation of cases .\nThree out of ten students failed to show up on the first day of school following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the coronavirus.\n\u201d Oakland \u2019 s school district will not enforce its mandate until Jan. 31 , a month later than originally planned .\nWhen the school board voted ( 5-1-1 ) in favor of mandating COVID shots for in-person instruction for students 12 and up , it apparently did not bargain on nearly two-fifths of students in that age group ( 38 % ) remaining unvaccinated .\nCasting the lone \u201c no \u201d vote , Oakland school board member Mike Hutchinson stated , \u201c I don \u2019 t think we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not very publicized meeting , talking about mandatory vaccinations when there \u2019 s nothing wrong with taking our due time to deliberate to make sure that we get it right.\n\u201d In December , however , Hutchinson indicated he would be comfortable deferring to the state-level mandate .\nIn late December in San Diego , a judge struck down the school district \u2019 s COVID vaccine mandate for students 16 and older , arguing the state legislature has not given individual school districts the authority to mandate vaccines for school attendance .\nAn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s school board to vote in favor of COVID mandates argued last fall , \u201c This is not the time for timidity.\n\u201d However , as evidence accumulates about the injections \u2019 outsized risks for children , it seems increasingly clear that a number of so-called public servants do not have a problem with timidity , having shown themselves perfectly willing to harm \u2014 and kill \u2014 children .\nFor former Pfizer executive Dr. Mike Yeadon , who has argued for months that the COVID injections \u201c are toxic by design \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , \u201d it seems obvious \u201c criminal acts are being committed.\n\u201d Now is the time to push back against criminality and coercion \u2014 including COVID vaccine mandates and \u201c vaccine passports \u201d \u2014 in whatever ways we can .\nOur children \u2019 s lives , and our own lives

anymore is prevent transmission , \u201d 1 whereas before , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jab , you have nothing to worry about anymore .\nIn July 2021 , President Biden promised that if you get vaccinated , \u201c you \u2019 re not going to get COVID.\n\u201d 2 Well , it wasn \u2019 t true .\nMany knew that , but were censored when pointing it out .\nA day earlier , January 9 , Walensky also sent out a tweet saying \u201c We must protect people with comorbidities from severe COVID-19 , \u201d which is what tens of thousands of doctors have been calling for since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in early October 2020 .\nIt called for focused protection of high-risk individuals , such as the elderly , rather than blanket lockdowns .\nIt was recently revealed that Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) and his former boss , now retired National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) director Francis Collins , colluded behind the scenes to quash the declaration.3 For whatever reason , Fauci and Collins were hell-bent on pushing economy-destroying lockdowns instead .\nIn an October 8 , 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Don \u2019 t worry , I got this , \u201d Fauci replied .\nLater , Fauci sent Collins links to newly published articles refuting the focused protection solution , including an op-ed in Wired magazine , and an article in The Nation , titled \u201c Focused Protection , Herd Immunity and Other Deadly Delusions.\n\u201d Now , all of a sudden , Walensky is onboard with the \u201c deadly delusion \u201d of focused protection .\nHer about-face would be confusing were it not for the fact that COVID countermeasures were never about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the start , the pandemic had political goals , and it still does .\nThe pressure is now on to prove the Biden administration has made some sort of progress with the pandemic .\nBiden made a lot of promises , none of which have come to fruition , so now the political establishment is scrounging to come up with some plan that can make them look as though they \u2019 re getting somewhere .\nThe problem is that cases are now exploding , when a successful vaccine campaign should have brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they now need a way to minimize the number of cases , whereas before , they used every trick in the book to overcount them,8 in order to scare people into complying with COVID restrictions and getting the jab .\nOne simple way to cut down cases is to limit testing , and that \u2019 s another U-turn we \u2019 re now seeing .\nThe CDC is now saying you should not retest once you \u2019 ve recovered from COVID .\nIf you test positive , just quarantine for five days and don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re negative , as the PCR can provide false positives for up to 12 weeks after the infection has been resolved .\nWell , we \u2019 ve known this for nearly two years already .\nFrom the start , experts warned that the PCR can not be used to diagnose an active infection , as it can pick up RNA from dead , noninfectious viral debris .\nHealth authorities are now spinning the tale that these revisions in guidance are because we have two years \u2019 worth of data , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that \u2019 s pure baloney , seeing how the data never supported their COVID restrictions in the first place .\nThe CDC \u2019 s decision to revise quarantine guidelines down from 10 days to just five days also appears politically motivated .\nPolls show the economy is a primary concern of voting Americans right now , so they need to strike a balance between the desired demolition of the economy and keeping people at work \u2014 at least until the 2022 elections are over .\nIn short , I suspect most if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID guidance is to build a narrative that the Biden administration has successfully brought the pandemic under control and reestablished a working economy .\nThe change in narrative is based on political strategy , not science .\nAs noted by Paul in the Liberty Report above , Walensky recently stated that 75 % of COVID deaths had four or more comorbidities , \u201c So , really , these are people who were unwell to begin with.\n\u201d The admission went viral and was cited as proof that COVID is a lethal risk for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The CDC quickly stepped in , clarifying that she meant \u201c 75 % of COVID deaths among those who have received the COVID jab , \u201d not COVID deaths overall.9 You can see the unedited segment above , where that context is made clear .\nStill , we know that COVID poses very little risk for healthy unvaccinated people as well , and that comorbidities are a primary risk factor regardless of your COVID jab status .\nCOVID Death Risk Has Always Been Low \u2014 Vaxxed or Not For example , a 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients in New York City had two or more comorbidities , 6.3 % had one underlying health condition and 6.1 % had none .\nIn late August 2020 , the CDC published data showing only 6 % of the total death count had COVID-19 listed as the sole cause of death .\nThe remaining 94 % had had an average of 2.6 comorbidities or preexisting health conditions that contributed to their deaths.11 So , yes , COVID is a lethal risk only for the sickest among us , just as Walensky said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re \u201c vaccinated \u201d or not .\nAs for the study12 Walensky discussed in that \u201c Good Morning America \u201d segment , it found that of the 1.2 million COVID jabbed subjects , only 0.0033 % died of COVID between December 2020 and October 2021 .\n( And of those , 77.8 % had four or more comorbidities . )\nThis study , Walensky claims as evidence that the COVID shot works wonders to reduce the risk of death .\nBut does it really ?\nRecall studies13 showing the noninstitutionalized infection fatality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin with , and people under the age of 40 have only a 0.01 % risk of dying from COVID.14 When we \u2019 re talking about a fraction of a percentage point risk , we \u2019 re talking about a risk that is close to statistical zero .\nSo , does lowering your risk of death from 0.01 % to 0.003 % really translate into something worthwhile ?\nAnd , more importantly , is that reduction worth the risks involved with taking the jab ?\nClearly , it \u2019 s not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual life insurance company , recently warned that all-cause deaths among working age Americans ( 18 to 64 ) are up 40 % over prepandemic norms,15 and they can not be attributed to COVID .\nSo , what \u2019 s causing these deaths ?\nWhat potentially deadly thing did tens of millions of Americans do in 2021 that they \u2019 ve never done before ?\nI \u2019 ll let you ponder whether Walensky \u2019 s claim that the COVID jab is saving lives is an accurate one .\nThis , again , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the start of the pandemic .\nMost so-called \u201c COVID patients \u201d simply weren \u2019 t , and still aren \u2019 t .\nThey \u2019 re hospitalized for something else entirely , and just happen to get a positive test result upon admission \u2014 which very possibly is a false positive .\nEither way , voila , they \u2019 re a COVID patient , even though they \u2019 re hospitalized for a broken leg or a heart attack .\nAs noted by Delta News TV , \u201c Comments like these have cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID surge even as the Supreme Court considers legal challenges to Biden \u2019 s sweeping private sector mandates on that very issue.\n\u201d 17 Is the Political Pandemic in Its Final Death Throes ?\nIn a January 10 , 2022 , blog post,18 Jeff Childers , an attorney , and the president and founder of Childers Law firm , presents a hypothesis for why we might be looking at the end of the pandemic , as the Biden administration has \u201c no reasonable alternative but to wrap this whole thing up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points out how a federal judge recently ordered the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to release all the Pfizer COVID jab data that the agency wanted 75 years to release .\nThe bulk of that data is now due March 1 , 2022 , the day of Biden \u2019 s State of the Union address .\nChilders suspects the Pfizer documents will contain plenty of counternarrative fodder and politically embarrassing details .\nWhy We \u2019 re Seeing a U-Turn in the Narrative Now Biden needs some good news by his State of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be his last chance to \u201c help move the needle back toward blue , \u201d and the way he can do that is by declaring the pandemic over .\nHe can then claim to be the great liberator who ended the pandemic measures for good .\nBut to pull off that U-turn with any semblance of credibility , they have to start cutting the case rate now , and that \u2019 s precisely what we \u2019 re seeing .\nFor example , the CDC recently changed its guidelines so you don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovered from COVID , so no more false positives from recovered people .\nFlorida \u2019 s official policy is now to only test high-risk individuals and those who are symptomatic .\nChilders points out that the left-leaning Sun Sentinel even ran an article highlighting the fact that despite surging case rates , Florida has the lowest COVID death rate in the nation , second only to the sparsely populated Alaska .\n\u201c What incredibly powerful force could make the Sun Sentinel downplay the pandemic like this ?\n\u201d he asks .\nWill We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nThe CDC also appears poised to change the definition of COVID death to what it should have been all along .\nChilders notes : They \u2019 re also starting to accurately count only those who are actually sick with COVID rather than including people hospitalized for other reasons who just happen to test positive .\nSame Narrative Switch Seen in Europe The same sudden switch in narrative can be seen in Europe .\nChilders continues:22 In a January 3 , 2022 , interview with the Daily Telegraph , professor Andrew Pollard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Vaccination and Immunization who helped create the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot , also made a previously verboten statement : \u201c We can \u2019 t vaccinate the planet every four or six months , \u201d he said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not sustainable or affordable.\n\u201d 23 And , like Dix , Pollard was not canceled , censored or deplatformed .\nJanuary 11 , 2022 , Bloomberg also reported that \u201c European Union regulators warned that frequent COVID-19 booster shots could adversely affect the immune response and may not be feasible .\nRepeat booster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immune response and tire out people , according to the European Medicines Agency.\n\u201d 24 Marco Cavaleri , the EMA \u2019 s head of vaccines strategy , said during a January 11 , 2022 , press briefing:25 That same day , the World Health Organization \u2019 s Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition ( TAG-CO-VAC ) also issued a statement26 saying that \u201c a vaccination strategy based on repeated booster doses of the original vaccine composition is unlikely to be appropriate or sustainable.\n\u201d They also stated that COVID vaccines that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be developed .\nThe timing of all these statements is nothing if not remarkable .\nIt shows just how coordinated this plandemic narrative is , all around the world .\nPerhaps the best example that the narrative is undergoing a radical overhaul , Childers says , is Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor being fact checked and called out as a liar by The Washington Post : Like Waking Times on Facebook .\nFollow Waking Times on

statistics and propaganda will carry you for a while , but eventually people are going to need to experience something at least resembling an actual devastating worldwide plague , in reality , not just on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GloboCap seriously overplayed their hand with the miracle \u201c vaccines.\n\u201d Covidian cultists really believed that the \u201c vaccines \u201d would protect them from

Extermination of Lower Classes Get the latest Waking Times articles delivered to your inbox .\nSign up here .\nEugenics is an attempt to produce genetically desirable children and to terminate the lives of those considered to be genetically inferior .\nElements of eugenics exist everywhere .\nFor example , when given the choice , people produce children with partners whom they find attractive .\nPart of them hopes that those attractive qualities will manifest in the offspring .\nA more extreme form is infanticide : killing children usually because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as old as humanity.1 In Ancient Greece , Plato and Socrates ( c. 470-399 BCE ) suggested ways of breeding to promote the superior traits of the elite , as sickly infants were deliberately left to die of exposure.2 Today , there is a sensible and ethical side of what is often called eugenics .\nExamples include disabled children having operations to save their lives and individuals with learning difficulties asking for sterilisation because they can \u2019 t manage contraception and don \u2019 t want children .\nBut institutions like the state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as privileged elites , use eugenics as a way of trying to exterminate the elements of society whom they consider to be a burden .\nWhat started out as selective breeding and infanticide has today developed into forced sterilisation and genetic editing to produce \u201c designer babies.\n\u201d This thinking also informs certain depopulation agendas .\nIn 1866 in Imperial Russia , the obstetrician Vasilii Florinskii authored a book advocating for scientific methods to improve human traits .\nGiven the poverty of Russia at the time , there were no medical facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not endure a eugenics programme until the Bolsheviks seized power in 1917 .\nIn Germany , the term \u201c racial hygiene \u201d ( Rassenhygiene ) was coined in 1895 by the biologist Dr Alfred Ploetz ( 1860-1940 ) .\nThe notion later informed Nazi thinking on eugenics .\nThe British biologist Sir Francis Galton ( 1822-1911 ) coined the term eugenics ( meaning of good birth ) and described it as \u201c the science of improving inherited stock , not only by judicious matings , but by all the influences which give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 Galton was inspired by his cousin , Charles Darwin ( 1809-82 ) , who was cautious about eugenics .\nThe influential book An Essay on the Principle of Population ( 1798 ) written by the economist , Thomas Malthus ( 1766-1834 ) , also influenced Galton .\nIn it , Malthus argued that unlimited population growth was unsustainable .\nMore inspiration came from Herbert Spencer ( 1820-1903 ) , the sociologist who coined the term \u201c survival of the fittest.\n\u201d 5 In 1907 , Galton established the University of London \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilhelm Schallmayer ( 1857-1919 ) authored popular books concerning selective breeding among elites to further \u201c civilisation.\n\u201d 6 Just as US eugenicist groups were sponsored by corporate foundations , Schallmayer was promoted by Krupp , the German industrial giant .\nMost early feminists opposed abortion , so eugenics was , in many ways , a proxy for abortion .\nIn the 1900s , Germany \u2019 s Bund f\u00fcr Mutterschutz ( Organisation for Maternal Protection ) saw feminists and socialists advocate for eugenics in an effort to own their bodies and gain credence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BfM was established by Elisabeth Bouness ( Ruth Br\u00e9 , 1862-1911 ) , who fostered support groups for single , unwed mothers .\nOther , more right-wing eugenicists like Agnes Bluhm ( 1862-1943 ) , dismissed the BfM \u2019 s utopianism .\nMen , conversely , tended to see eugenics as an opportunity to further their control over female bodies .\nInspired by Malthus , the British Eugenics Education Society was founded in 1907 by Sybil Gotto ( 1885-1955 ) and headed by Galton .\nForty-percent of its members were women .\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c maimed , diseased , unwanted babies.\n\u201d Dora Marsden ( 1882-1960 ) , editor of Freewoman , opposed the Eugenics Education Society ( EES ) as \u201c a conspiracy against the poor.\n\u201d The Swedish feminist Ellen Key ( 1849-1926 ) explained that society should protect all \u201c except that which gives occasion to a weak offspring and produces bad conditions for the development of that offspring.\n\u201d 7 Eugenicists relied on biology to try to define superior and inferior characteristics .\nThey utilised statistics to try to prove that the lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEES members like the mathematician and later Ministry of Food statistician , David Heron ( 1881-1969 ) , explained that : \u201c higher net fertility is shewn\u2026 to be very markedly correlated with the most undesirable social factors ( sic ) .\n\u201d We now know that poverty can cause serious cognitive problems in developing brains .\nAt the time , poverty-related impaired cognitive function \u2013 then called \u201c feeble mindedness \u201d \u2013 was falsely attributed to genetics .\nA 1912 report by the Committee to Consider the Eugenic Aspect of Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d \u2013 who could not work and were of negative value to the capitalist class \u2013 as \u201c the chief burden on the public purse , \u201d as they required health and social care ; both of which were still in their infancy .\nBritish eugenicists failed in their lobby to legalise for forced sterilisation,8 passing instead the Mental Deficiency Act 1913 , which sought to institutionalise people with particular needs .\nMany British female eugenicists opposed the Act because it primarily targeted single mothers.9 The British economist John Maynard Keynes ( 1883-1946 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state-planning over national economies .\nKeynes believed that law and other coercive measures could be imposed on population abroad to improve their living standards by reducing their overall numbers .\nIn 1914 , for instance , he wrote : \u201c In many , if not in most , parts of the world there actually exists at the present time a denser population than is compatible with a high level of economic wellbeing.\n\u201d 10 FROM BRITAIN TO THE USA According to some scholars , 19th-century pedigree animal breeding inspired US eugenics , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eugenics movement.11 By the 1910s , US states , particularly in the south , hosted \u201c Better Babies \u201d competitions , in which the mental and physical characteristics of infants were measured and tabulated by eugenicists.12 Writing for American Breeders Magazine in 1910 , C.B .\nDavenport ( 1866-1944 ) , director of the Cold Spring Harbor Station for Experimental Study of Evolution , argued that \u201c society must protect itself \u201d from the so-called feeble-minded by \u201c segregation \u201d or even sterilisation .\nAmerican eugenicists established the Carnegie-funded Eugenics Record Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and birth control advocate , Margaret Sanger ( 1879-1966 ) , opened America \u2019 s first birth control clinic in New York in 1916 .\nSanger also helped to create the organisation Planned Parenthood .\nBut these progressive steps masked another agenda.14 Sanger was a strong advocate for eugenics , even speaking about the subject at a Ku Klux Klan meeting to white supremacists , who had an interest in wiping out the Black population.15 In 1924 , the psychologist and feminist , Leta Hollingworth ( 1886-1939 ) , explained that \u201c the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world of competition , and who are also able to produce children like themselves.\n\u201d Sponsored by eugenics societies , \u201c Fitter Families \u201d competitions awarded medals , inscribed with : \u201c Yea , I have a goodly heritage.\n\u201d 16 In the US , eugenicists were behind the Immigration Act 1924 which limited the entering into the US of foreign paupers whom the establishment considered genetically inferior.17 In 1927 , US Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes affirmed the constitutionality of forced sterilisation when he decreed in the case of Carrie Buck ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning difficulties ) vs. John Hendren Bell ( a eugenicist ) : \u201c three generations of imbeciles are enough.\n\u201d ( Buck \u2019 s mother had also been misdiagnosed with mental disorders . )\n18 After Buck v. Bell , a dozen US states felt empowered to enact sterilisation laws against the institutionalised.19 By the mid-1930s , eugenicists recognised their failure to turn their theory and practice into a science .\nBut there was no clear demarcation and eugenicist ideas developed as \u201c reform eugenics.\n\u201d The majority of eugenics sterilisation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Into the 1970s , federally-funded US medical facilities continued to quietly perform forced sterilisation , usually on Black women ; the most high-profile case being that of Minnie and Mary Relf , aged 12 and 14 .\nOther cases included the sterilisation of Mexican migrant women by Californian obstetricians.21 In 1975 , the federally-funded Indian Health Service sterilised 25,000 Indigenous women.22 As part of its population-reducing , one-child policies , between 1971 and 2013 , Chinese state and local authorities forced 200 million sterilisations and over 330 million abortions on lower-class women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their breeding by paying \u201c social compensation \u201d fees .\nAs part of India \u2019 s so-called Emergency , declared in 1975 in response to population booms , India began the forcible sterilisation of 10 million people by 1977 .\nLater , allegedly softer measures were imposed , such as financial incentives for poor families to undergo sterilisation : 90 percent of the victims were women and included 4.6 million people in the year 2012 alone .\nIn the poorest state , Bihar , 13,000 medical camps were established to sterilise 650,000 women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karl Binding ( 1841-1920 ) and the psychiatrist Alfred Hoche ( 1865-1943 ) co-authored the book , Permitting the Destruction of Life Unworthy of Living ( Die Freigabe der Vernichtung Lebensunwertes Lebens ) , in which they gave legal and medical justifications for murder as mercy killing ( euthanasia ) .\nTheir text cites eugenics and social Darwinism .\nRejected by most physicians at the time , the Binding-Hoche thesis informed Nazi eugenics policy.23 Between the mid-1920s and the close of the Second World War , 60,000 Americans were forcibly sterilised .\nAfter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , US sterilisation typically occurred behind closed doors in institutions.24 In 1930s Germany , conditions including epilepsy , manic-depression , and schizophrenia were attributed solely to Mendelian regressive genes.25 When the Nazis came to power in 1933 , they legislated to have physicians send patients with particular needs , including physical and mental , to sterilisation courts where judges , panels , witnesses , and medical professionals would decide their reproductive fate.26 The Nazis promoted Lebensborn ( Fount of Life ) to increase the birth-rate of \u201c Aryan \u201d children.27 At least 350,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 1945 .\nBecause sterilisation was legal in many US states , the Nazis were not tried at Nuremberg for eugenics.28 By the mid-1930s , more than half of Germany \u2019 s physicians had joined the Nazi Party , seeing themselves as \u201c biological soldiers \u201d in the war against racial impurity .\n\u201c Defective \u201d German children were left to die of starvation and exposure in unheated wards .\nOthers were poisoned with cyanide .\nNazi Germany \u2019 s forced sterilisation law was also imposed on the countries it occupied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder of \u201c unfit \u201d adults was usually conducted by morphine injections and the issuance of fake death certificates .\nBy 1939 , over 200,000 people had been murdered in the T4 eugenics programme.29 One of the more unusual chapters in the history of the eugenics-depopulation agenda pushed by some elites concerns the Georgia Guidestones .\nElberton , Georgia , is known as the granite capital of the world.30 In 1979 , one Robert C. Christian ( pseudonym ) commissioned Joe H. Fendley ( c. 1935-2005 ) , President of the Elberton Granite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , capped slabs of the 19-feet-high monument to \u201c The Age of Reason.\n\u201d The Guidestones \u2019 inscribed \u201c ten commandments \u201d include depopulation and eugenics : \u201c Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature .\nGuide reproduction wisely improving fitness and diversity.\n\u201d We \u2019 ve seen how the elites feared being outbred by the riffraff .\nThis theme continued into the late-1960s , with fears that third world populations were breeding out of control and threatening the resources of the privileged .\nMany of the theories were presented as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t enough food and space to live worthwhile lives .\nThis was popularised by the biologist , Paul Ehrlich ( born 1932 ) , whose book The Population Bomb ( 1968 ) presented an internationalist argument for population control through education , contraception , and financial inducements .\nUnder cover of philanthropy , the book pushed an environmental agenda .\nNotably absent from the book is a critique of capitalism , which observes that children starve because poor countries export food to rich markets , that big industry poisons children as a consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often privatised .\nFounded in the same year as Ehrlich \u2019 s book , the Club of Rome was set up by Aurelio Peccei and Alexander King .\nIts book The Limits to Growth ( 1972 , Universe Books ) made much the same arguments as Ehrlich .\nIn 1988 , the Club of Rome welcomed a speech by Britain \u2019 s Prince Philip ( born 1921 ) .\nIn the same year , the noble Prince told German media : \u201c In the event that I am reincarnated , I would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contribute something to solving overpopulation , \u201d 31 and in doing so exposed the antihuman thread that underlies some of the environmental movement .\nInfamously , another Club of Rome endeavour , The First Global Revolution ( 1991 ) , argued that humans need a common enemy .\nWhere states and religious minorities fail to act as that enemy , \u201c the new enemy \u201d would be \u201c humanity itself.\n\u201d Of course , the Club of Rome \u2019 s limited budget was no match for the oil industry , which swamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so their agenda largely failed .\nClimate change deniers attacked sustainability initiatives such as the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development \u2019 s document , Agenda 21 , a nonbinding , failed roadmap towards sustainability.32 In fairness to those who see conspiracy , the UN Environment Programme \u2019 s co-founder and energy businessman , Maurice Strong ( 1929-2015 ) , told the Earth Summit 1992 : \u201c We are now a species out of control .\nOur very success is leading us to a dangerous future\u2026 [ O ] verall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue\u2026 Population must be stabilised.\n\u201d 33 The global corporate system has extracted material wealth from the third world , including food and minerals .\nIn doing so , it has facilitated third world overpopulation ( China pop .\n1.4bn , India 1.3bn ) , because poor people tend to have more children than middle-class people due to factors including lack of sex education , the unavailability of contraception , religious indoctrination , male domination , and efforts to increase the likelihood of offspring survival by bearing large numbers of children .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , Europe , and Australasia , fertility has declined drastically .\nThe wealth that is sucked out of the third world causes socioeconomic changes in the West , where people have affluence in the form of smartphones and packaged holidays but no real wealth in terms of affordable housing or savings .\nThis makes it difficult to raise families .\nIt takes two people to make a baby .\nThat means if the fertility rate is two children per female in her lifetime , global population will not significantly fall or rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average number of children per female was 4.7 in 1950 , hence the rapid growth of the world \u2019 s population .\nBut by 2017 , it was 2.4 .\nAcross Western Europe , it is 1.7 , meaning that Europe is in demographic decline.34 Unlike the ideologies of the recent past , like those of the Club of Rome , today \u2019 s depopulation agenda has coupled with big oil .\nThe Michael Moore production , Planet of the Humans ( 2020 ) , uses outdated and often false information about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( big oil agenda ) while simultaneously interviewing privileged middle-aged-to-elderly white males about how people of colour in poor countries are killing the planet ( Club of Rome-type agenda ) .\nThe filmmakers \u2019 solution to overconsumption is depopulation .\nToday , genetic screening and gene editing have the potential to realise the dreams of eugenicists .\nPart of their agenda is to own life , while the agenda of the corporations to which some of them ally is purely to make money .\nThis can be done , in part , via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life .\nThe patenting of life began in 1971 .\nDr Ananda Chakrabarty ( 1938-2020 ) of the giant corporation , General Electric , applied to the US Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) to register a genetically-modified organism ( GMO ) , which he \u2019 d engineered to eat oil spills .\nThe PTO rejected the application on the grounds that living things are not patentable .\nChakrabarty appealed to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals , whose judges voted in his favour .\nThe decision allowed anything but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patented .\nSince then , the race to patent every gene and combination means that corporations and entrepreneurs own 20 percent of the human genome via 40,000 patents.35 In 1984 , after one John Moore ( 1945-2001 ) attended the University of California-Los Angeles for cancer treatment , the University together with the Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corp. obtained and patented his spleen cells ( making $ 3 billion in the process ) , without Moore \u2019 s knowledge or consent .\nIn 1990 , the Supreme Court of California ruled that Moore had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 127,000 patent applications were filed for human genes and sequences.36 In 1998 , the geneticist Dr David J. Galton , a relative of Sir Francis , wrote not of the immorality of eugenics but of the need for better regulation : \u201c To prevent such abuses in the future statutory bodies , such as a genetics commission , should be established to provide guidance and rules of conduct.\n\u201d 37 In 2003 , the geneticist Charles Epstein wrote : \u201c modern human genetics and medical genetics\u2026 are eugenic \u2013 if not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , at least a reincarnation of that eugenics in a new guise.\n\u201d 38 Between 2005 and 2016 , dozens of female prisoners were sterilised in California without their informed consent.39 Historian Daniel J. Kevles says that humanity \u201c now possesses tools to reshape its own hereditary capacities , perhaps even to realise the dream of eugenicists that human beings might take charge of their own evolution.\n\u201d 40 Today , dozens of gene-editing companies offer services in agbiotech , biobanking , cell therapy , DNA sequencing , stems , synthetic biology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential to work in the interests of eugenicists ; for example , by editing genes to enhance certain traits desired by parents .\nUnder the section \u201c New Humans , \u201d the UK Ministry of Defence notes that out to the year 2036 : \u201c The application of advanced genetics could challenge current assumptions about human nature and existence.\n\u201d It goes on to note that , \u201c [ i ] nitially employed for medical purposes , breakthroughs in these areas could be put to ethically questionable uses.\n\u201d Examples include \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical strength and sensory perception.\n\u201d It concludes that \u201c [ e ] xtreme variation in attributes could arise between individuals , [ or ] between societies , creating additional reasons for conflict.\n\u201d Another section of the report notes that \u201c biotechnology and genetic engineering may be combined to create \u2018 designer \u2019 bio-weapons to target crops , livestock , or particular ethnic groups \u201d ( emphasis in original ) .\nThe document ends with reference to the final step in eugenics : ethnic cleansing .\nIn referencing neutron weapons , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MoD states : \u201c The ability to inflict organic destruction , while leaving infrastructure intact , might make it a weapon of choice for extreme ethnic cleansing in an increasingly populated world.\n\u201d 42 This article has traced the thread of eugenics from our ancient past to the trans- and post-humanist visions of gene-editing tech-heads .\nThe article has documented how eugenics can infringe upon human rights and even lead to genocide .\nA final thought concerns elder care and social security in economically neoliberal states .\nIn the UK , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2010-present ) have , in the last decade , killed a quarter of a million economically useless Britons via fiscal austerity : old people who needed later-life care , disabled people claiming social security , and the most impoverished who depended on the state for their survival.43 In the minds of policymakers , eugenics is alive and well .\nDr T.J.

as such , it requires a disciplined focus .\nYet as we have seen , modern societies not only do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they also actively dissuade us from approaching them .\nThe result of this is that people in general do not see \u2013 or feel \u2013 a need for such a discernment .\nModern life keeps us occupied and diverted by other pursuits .\nUnfortunately , it is often the case that \u2018 shock impacts \u2019 are required in order for us to shift our attention away from the \u2018 straight path \u2019 of normalized living .\nAnd we \u2019 ve been living with such a \u2018 shock event \u2019 for almost two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic .\nWe could see our current predicament from this perspective : that modern life was in need of a \u2018 crisis point \u2019 within its old patterns for there to arise within people the need for something else .\nIt is in such moments of deep reflection that an inner realization may occur : the recognition that common ( i.e.\n, consensus ) culture does not provide sufficient meaning for our lives .\nThat is , there is the lack of any transcendental , metaphysical impulse .\nAn awareness of such lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a noticeable deterioration in social and cultural systems .\nSuch recognition \u2013 or re-cognition \u2013 is not yet dominant among the majority of our modern so-called \u2018 civilized \u2019 nations .\nYet we are soon reaching that tipping point .\nFor too long we have been absent from the vale of \u2018 soul-making , \u2019 to quote the poet John Keats .\nAnd yet the signs have always been there to guide the way .\nWhen our early cave-dwelling ancestors first made their handprints upon the walls of their caves they were signalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am here \u2013 I exist.\n\u2019 The inner spark of the human being was attempting to be heard \u2013 to be imprinted onto the outer life .\nIt was an early stage in the expression of an interiorized human consciousness .\nIn each epoch our consciousness perceives and interprets reality in a particular way .\nHow we experience the reality around us influences our perception of it , and vice-versa .\nThis is why our perceptions have always been a target for direct manipulation \u2013 it is our reality-sensing software .\nAs part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin by a recognition of the following factors : i ) acknowledgement of one \u2019 s situation and the need for self-development and/or life adjustment ; and ii ) the need for partial detachment from one \u2019 s social and cultural conditioning and external influences .\nBy recognizing these two factors a person can make the first step to self-aware discernment .\nA gradual de-conditioning of the social personality ( the persona ) helps to develop a detached perspective and to see external impacts for what they are .\nIn order to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methodically de-clutter our social personality .\nThen , and only then , can a conscious step be taken toward inner freedom and genuine liberty .\nThat is , the old patterns must become less determined , dogmatic , and fixed .\nThen through this space , where old belief patterns have left their moorings , can new perceptions emerge .\nAs this process gradually unfolds it is important that each person stays grounded in the world \u2013 in their everyday lives \u2013 and not to entertain themselves with amusing fantasies or unwarranted intoxications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that in all we do we should be in harmony and balance , and not in conflict with our everyday life .\nOur dignity and decency is not in what it has achieved , nor what it is , but in what it can become .\nAnd this is a choice each person can make .\nAs in everything in our lives , we make a choice .\nWhen it comes down to basics \u2013 which it inevitably must do \u2013 then we find that we have a fundamental choice between living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn other words , if we choose Love then we side with compassion , empathy , creativity , connection , support , sharing , and resilience .\nAnd if we choose to align with the Fear then we give ourselves over to control , manipulation , anxiety , and vulnerability \u2013 all the expressions of a culture of oppression .\nIf we ascribe to a life lived as islands of separation , then inevitably we learn ( or are conditioned ) to place our trust externally upon a range of institutions ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , social , educational , political , etc .\nAnd if these institutions fail us then we naturally feel vulnerability , or even betrayed .\nAnd yet the truth of the matter is that we betrayed ourselves in the first place by outsourcing our trust .\nIf we live a life relying upon external systems , then we must be prepared to feel distraught should those external systems break-down .\nIn such times of great transition , such as now , these social institutions are themselves very fragile .\nFurther , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be corrupt \u2013 or being utilized by corrupt human agents .\nRight now , I would say that we are witnessing the \u2018 great unravelling \u2019 of many of our once trusted systems .\nWe are seeing head-on the undoing of many dishonest , unethical , and toxic structures that inevitably can no longer serve our interests .\nThis unravelling is revealing that our sense of vulnerability is partly the dismantling of our false assumptions .\nAnd further , that our sense of vulnerability is the fear of letting go .\nIt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if it is of the disagreeable kind .\nYet in being open to such information does not mean we should adopt a position of fear .\nWe have to make a choice of not accepting , or adopting , these external aspects of fear and toxicity .\nThey do not \u2018 belong \u2019 to us .\nIn knowing this , we are compelled to seek out those experiences that feel real to us , and which can assist us in developing as human beings .\nIf there is a \u2018 truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must surely come not through artificial constructs but through our everyday personal experiences .\nTo understand that which we call the \u2018 self \u2019 is only a construct until we can experience it through the revelation brought about by others .\nAlone , we are unable to \u2018 see \u2019 the self \u2013 no more than we can see our own faces .\nAnd just as we need a mirror in order to view our face , so too do we need other people and experiences in life to be as mirrors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn the end , it is our participation in life that shall teach us the discernment we need to tell truth from falsehood .\nNo online course or TV program can teach us this .\nLet us not back away from ourselves \u2013 let us invite us closer in .\nKingsley L.

Eisenhower \u2019 s farewell address of Jan. 17 , 1961 , is just as relevant today as back then .\nIke warned American citizens of the \u201c military-industrial complex \u201d and the dangers it presented to our nation and the world .\nEisenhower was rightly wary of the armaments industry , which at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such a massive arms industry could dominate the nation .\nEisenhower

spiritual \u2013 is felt in every city , every state house , every office of the federal government .\nWe recognize the imperative need for this development .\nYet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications .\nOur toil , resources and livelihood are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our society.\n\u201d Resources for this arms industry would come from the American people .\nAnd if the arms industry is large , that burden becomes substantial .\nThe more you finance the military , the less money you have for other priorities .\nWith people profiting from armaments and their development , there will inevitably be the push for more weapons .\nAny arms buildup will encourage other nations to build up their weapons .\nArms races remain a continuing danger .\nIke believed the American people needed to be politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms industry .\nHe said : We need to question military spending , especially when it comes at the expense of social programs .\nFor example , the Build Back Better legislation is being rejected by many senators complaining about its costs .\nThis means important social programs , such as the Child Tax Credit , free school meals and summer feeding for impoverished children won \u2019 t get passed because they claim they \u2019 re too expensive .\nYet those same senators are not questioning a nearly $ 2 trillion program of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons simply encourages arms races with Russia and China .\nEisenhower warned against such reckless military spending that comes at the expense of the American people .\nIke said , \u201c As we peer into society \u2019 s future , we \u2014 you and I , and our government \u2014 must avoid the impulse to live only for today , plundering , for our own ease and convenience , the precious resources of tomorrow.\n\u201d Eisenhower emphasized in his speech the need for diplomacy and peacemaking .\nHe said : It is dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to disregard diplomacy makes it worse .\nWe have seen treaties rejected in recent years and no new ones being developed .\nThe U.S. withdrew from the Open Skies Treaty and has failed to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty .\nThese are both initiatives Eisenhower originally proposed with the idea of helping to move us away from expensive arms races .\nWe should expect our leaders to be mindful of Eisenhower \u2019 s military-industrial

the only factor , but it is most certainly undeniable .\nWhen workers go the way of John Galt , what else can we expect ?\nAnd people are ok with this !\nPeople are ok with the notion of forcibly pushing their will onto somebody else in order for them to earn a living .\nImagine the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to name their firstborn son if they wanted to keep working at your store .\n\u201c You want

willing to imprison you over this .\nPerhaps it is through house arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPerhaps it is through your typical jail .\nOr perhaps it \u2019 s landing armed men at your front door who will take you to \u201c temporarily live in designated facilities ?\n\u201d Once more , it appears the \u201c conspiracy theorists \u201d were right .\nWe now have people who are openly advocating for the

@ @ @ what is perhaps the most alarming aspect of this study is that there is a sizeable chunk of society that is seemingly ok with kidnapping your children if you don \u2019 t participate in the jab .\nWhere will they take them ?\nDo you think they have plans for letting you see them again ?\nDo you think your child would be the exemption to the rule ?\nThat they would be placed in a \u201c family \u201d that loves and cares for them anywhere close to the extent that you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children ?\nWould they be your values ?\nOr would they be evil ?\nThis is where America is .\nThe seeds of communism \u2013 planted long ago \u2013 have been permitted to flourish into a repugnant field of briars , and it has every intention of tearing you ( and your family ) apart .\nYou may say

actually enter the building to arrest anybody , but who are more than happy to drive their victims to the station for processing .\nThis is where America is at .\nSecondly , don \u2019 t fall into the trap of believing that your men are the exception to the rule .\nIf you are the leader of your men , and you are one of the good and brave , the system can easily replace you .\nPerhaps this will be done by a nationwide push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave men throughout the nation to realize it \u2019 s just not worth the cost .\nMaybe this replacement can be made possible by making it illegal for you to stay unless you take a jab .\nMen who are evil , cowardly , or without moral backbone are easy to find .\nAnd they can easily fill your slot .\nWhile I wholeheartedly believe in American exceptionalism , and that it is our bravery in standing against evil which maintains our freedom , I also understand this : How is it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( analyzed in Christopher Browning \u2019 s Ordinary Men ) were able to go from vomiting and suffering nightmares after their first Jewish action to becoming efficient killers by war \u2019 s end ?\nHow do average men , with families of their

observing a grand restructuring of human society and its many systems : financial , technological , political , cultural , and more .\nI have already spoken about how this is creating great discomfort and dissonance for many people .\nThis is inevitable , for great upheavals are rarely smooth or without disturbances and ripples .\nA new phase is emerging as the current phase is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a pond , they each create interference waves that clash .\nThe important point here is where a person chooses to position themselves .\nA new way of life can be brought into being , yet it must be birthed from within the current one as it breaks up .\nFor a time , both worlds will co-exist in the same physical space although they shall occupy a different energetic space .\nWhere a person can position themselves is to be in the world that is emerging of the world that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase has ended , there are those groups/agencies who have vested interests in maintaining this world , and they are desperately attempting to re-model it with a new facelift \u2013 as a technocracy .\nThere will be a stealthy attempt at a makeover , to present the \u2018 new future \u2019 in terms of an artificial , synthetic future .\nYet this is not an evolutionary future for humanity .\nThe new emerging world will remain organic , natural , and in biological balance .\nThis is the model that shall come forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal .\nWe should take heed from the wise words of Buckminster Fuller : \u201c You never change things by fighting the existing reality .\nTo change something , build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.\n\u201d We are here now to build a new model whilst existing within the current one that is fast becoming obsolete .\nThe power that the obsolete system , and its rulers , have over us depends upon our state of being ( level of frequency ) \u2013 that is , others can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are existing energetically ( aka , vibrating ) at their level .\nThe obsolete system wants for everyone to operate ( energetic state ) at its lower-level vibratory state .\nWe simply do not go there .\nWe have to secure and protect the most valuable thing to us \u2013 our consciousness .\nIn being better prepared for engaging with the changing world I suggest the following five aspects : 1 ) Conscious awareness ; 2 ) Connection ; 3 ) Communication ; 4 ) Creation ; 5 ) Comprehension .\n1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of what is happening in the world , including the distasteful aspects , but not to get dragged into or entangled with these events .\nAwareness is necessary , but only as a tool for self-knowledge \u2013 not to acquire more baggage from the world .\n2 . )\nConnection \u2013 to find and discover other people who are on the \u2018 same wavelength \u2019 and who think and perceive like you .\nReach out , connect with others , even if you have never previously met .\nSend them a message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another \u2019 s energy states .\nNever feel you are alone .\nThere are always other people out there who think and feel the same as you do .\nOlder social alliances will be breaking down .\nOld or existing friendships and bonds will be dissolving .\nThat \u2019 s okay \u2013 find new ones .\nRe-align your social alliances according to your new state of perception .\n3 . )\nCommunication \u2013 Share your thoughts and ideas with others .\nState your truths .\nLet others know what position you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence or anonymity .\nAllow others to also find you by letting them know your position and feelings .\nDo not be loud or go around shouting your views ; or , worse still , trying to persuade others to take your position .\nJust be confident to state your ideas when asked and to represent and communicate your own truths when necessary .\nBy communicating your position with the world outside of you , you shall also be strengthening the trust in yourself .\n4 . )\nCreation \u2013 be creative !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ world to pacify or nullify you .\nDo not be impotent to your own potentials just because of external uncertainties .\nIt is precisely at such times of dissolution and renewal that creativity is most needed .\nBeing creative does not only imply from an artistic point of view .\nNot everyone can be a painter or musician , etc .\nBut genuine creativity is about being resilient and finding new ways to do things .\nNew patterns of lifestyles ; different hobbies ; learning new skills ; preparing yourself physically , mentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being adaptive during moments of change .\n5 . )\nComprehension \u2013 be understanding of this change and how it is affecting others .\nRecognize that there will be many conflicting points of view and opinions .\nAcknowledge that many people will not only choose not to agree with you but that they may even attack your views .\nDo not let this sway you from your own understanding and your faith and trust in yourself .\nUnderstand the full scope of the wider implications and allow others to have their own views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or trespass on yours .\nAnd if , later on , some people wish to come over to your way of understanding , be gracious to them and not judgmental .\nWe are all learning at our own pace .\nPerhaps these five \u2018 C-Ways \u2019 will assist as we each move ahead into the paths we have chosen at this time .\nIt is not necessary to have a full picture or to know exactly how the next years will be .\nFor now , it is enough to visualize that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , only that it hasn \u2019 t been built yet .\nYou are there , energetically \u2013 later will come the physical structures .\nImagine there are two boats upon the water , an old sinking one and a new one .\nPlace yourselves on the new one and know that you are there already , even though it looks empty and without a full crew .\nFor if you believe yourself to be remaining on the old , sinking boat you will spend too much of your energies worrying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , desperately seeking for some unknown solutions .\nYet knowing that you are already upon the new boat \u2013 the new Ark \u2013 you will feel more balanced and energized , ready for sailing when the waters become clearer .\nYou are already where you wish yourself to be \u2013 it \u2019 s just that the new structures haven \u2019 t yet materialized .\nBut energetically \u2013 vibrationally \u2013 you are already aligned with the new phase of the human path you have chosen .\nAs Buckminster Fuller also said , \u201c We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future , not its victims.\n\u201d The new boat has no room for victims , yet plenty of space for those with a new vision for the future .\nKingsley L.

Universal Symbols", "content": "Archetypes To Live By : The Power of Universal Symbols Get the latest Waking Times articles delivered to your inbox .\nSign up here .\nA human life is a story , with a beginning , middle and an end .\nLike stories , our lives are filled with moments and experiences that shape us into who we ultimately become .\nMany of those moments and defining experiences become embedded within the subconscious mind , and even deeper into the \u2018 collective unconscious \u2019 where they continue to drive our behaviours , actions and thoughts long after their shelf-life has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbolic form , and , in turn , a universal aspect that is understood , and experienced , by others all over the world regardless of time , place , colour , gender or creed .\nThese universal symbols are called \u2018 archetypes \u2019 , a word which has its roots in the ancient Greek archein for \u2018 original , old \u2019 , and typos for \u2018 pattern , type or model \u2019 .\nArchetypes are models or blueprints of original patterns , concepts , ideas , objects , themes and motifs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emulated and derived from .\nThey serve as a foundation for understanding who we are not only as individuals , but as the collective of humanity as well .\nTwo of the biggest figures in the development and evolution of the study of archetypes were Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Gustav Jung , and comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell .\nBoth have been instrumental in our understanding of archetypes , and their research served as the springboard for more recent examinations by noted authors and experts in the field of personal transformation .\nBefore we delve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to understand the levels of the human mind and how they operate .\nThe most obvious to us is the conscious mind , which basically is the present and aware mind we live with on a daily basis .\nIt is awake , rational , analytical and observant , but also preoccupied , overwhelmed and distracted .\nIt is both clear mind and monkey mind , and the level of mind we use to interact with others and our physical environment .\nJust below the level of the conscious mind lies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast majority of our behaviours , thoughts , actions and personalities emerge from .\nLike the base of an iceberg , the tip being the conscious mind , the subconscious is the \u2018 driver \u2019 of the vehicle and is a place of shadows and darkness , buried experiences and embedded patterns , old beliefs and fears and all sorts of programming that has built up over the years , often at the hands of external influences like parents , peers , teachers , religious and political figures and cultural beliefs .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subconscious mind often derails those plans because of old patterns we don \u2019 t even know are there .\nSo , it makes sense that most of who we believe ourselves to be is not even who we really are .\nRather , it is the product of the vast expanses of the subconscious .\nAnd it is very hard to find the programming within , let alone change it !\nDeeper still is a realm of mind that connects us to everyone else , and to all of humanity .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with images and symbols as its means of expression .\nDreams , visions , patterns , and yes , archetypes , live here in the collective unconscious , which may be described as the universal grid we are all locked into , yet often completely unaware of .\nCarl Jung believed that it was here , at this deepest layer of reality , of mind , that most of what made us \u2018 us \u2019 existed .\nThe collective unconscious is not a place where language and words are spoken , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbols are universal to humanity , and links us to those who have lived in the past , and to those who live thousands of miles away , in cultures and societies far different than our own .\nOn this level , we all \u2018 get \u2019 each other .\nBorn in 1875 , Carl Gustav Jung was a Swiss-German with a fascination for the fields of psychiatry and psychotherapy .\nHe began his illustrious career as a student of Sigmund Freud until differences of ideologies , basically those of Freud involving infantile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jung to strike out on his own .\nJung believed that the world \u2019 s myths , origin stories and even religious stories contained universalities that were shared by all , even amongst cultures that had no interaction with one another .\nHow could this be ?\nJung noted the symbols common to all were archetypes , stored away in the collective unconscious , but always popping up into our human experiences and interactions in very visible and identifiable ways .\nFrom this \u201c common psychic substrate , \u201d as Jung called it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one of us , comes the very source materials from which we become \u2018 human \u2019 in a way we can all identify with .\nHe wrote extensively about this in his seminal books , notably The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious , which suggested archetypal symbols are not learned but inborn .\nThese patterns were inherited by each generation by both genetic and non-genetic means .\nThey became a part of the DNA of humanity , so to speak .\nThe Jungian archetypes became the structures by which psychology , psychotherapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the deepest root causes of personal patterns , dream motifs and long-held problems the conscious mind could not overcome or change .\nThese symbols also infiltrate every aspect of creativity , entertainment and today \u2019 s pop culture in the characters and themes we most flock to in novels , movies and television shows .\nPERSONA : The mask we wear to others , and often ourselves .\nThis is our public role and the way we wish to be perceived out in the world .\nIt is NOT the true person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self , which can only be achieved once we have unified the SHADOW side and the ANIMA/ANIMUS .\nThe whole SELF .\nThis is what we should have as the ultimate goal \u2013 the real person we want to , and were meant to , be .\nSHADOW : The \u2018 dark \u2019 aspects of SELF we often deny exist or tuck away into the depths of the subconscious .\nThis is our primal , sexual , animal side .\nIt is both creative and destructive , and often contains all that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images of gender within .\nThe ANIMA is the female aspect , and the ANIMUS is the male aspect .\nFemales have a repressed ANIMUS they must acknowledge .\nMales have a repressed ANIMA .\nGREAT MOTHER : The nurturer and creative force , which begins as the archetypal MAIDEN , then becomes the caretaker and MOTHER of the world , and then becomes the wise old CRONE .\nHERO : The aspect that takes on challenges , exhibits bravery and courage , and partakes of the journey of life , obstacles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials and transformations that it entails .\nCHILD : The innocent one who sees life as pure .\nThe child within .\nWISE OLD MAN/WOMAN : The wise part of Self that knows all , sees all .\nAlso known as SAGE , PRIEST , PRIESTESS , MENTOR , and even KING or QUEEN .\nBoth kind and understanding , and cantankerous and snarky , just like our favourite grandparents .\nOther archetypes include everything from MARTYR , VICTIM , WARRIOR , SURVIVOR , PRINCE , PRINCESS , GODDESS , GOD , JESTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BEAST , HEALER , GENIUS , STORYTELLER , LEADER , FOLLOWER and even DEMON .\nWhile Jung was focused upon the main archetypes associated with his field of study , we can easily see how modern humans exhibit a number of archetypes he did not include , and how those evolve along with humanity as a whole .\nFor example , today we might call a \u2018 GEEK \u2019 an archetype that is associated with the rise of technology all over the world .\nA boy in Japan and an old woman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone immersed in gadgets and computer gear .\nToday , we might recognise a DIVA on a global scale , but thousands of years ago , she might have been called a GODDESS .\nWe evolve , and therefore the inherent archetypes that describe our experiences do too .\nArchetypes can even be applied to life events that are universal , such as birthdays , marriage , first menses , menopause , death , funeral rites , baptisms , and coming of age rituals .\nJung referred to them as \u201c situational archetypes.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world \u2019 s cultures , with only the specifics that are changed .\nInterestingly , life itself is an archetype\u2026 Joseph Campbell \u2019 s \u201c Hero \u2019 s Journey \u201d is an archetypal motif for the human experience , itself filled with archetypes , and one of the most identifiable explanations of the universality of the most popular stories , whether they are old or new .\nCampbell was a noted mythologist , writer and lecturer who literally put comparative religion and mythology into the hands of the layperson by making such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his many books , including The Power of Myth , and lecture series for PBS .\nHis \u201c Hero \u2019 s Journey \u201d motif was the basis for the most popular movie franchise in history , Star Wars , as George Lucas , the creator of the science fiction adventure series , was a huge fan of Campbell and met with him while structuring his storylines .\nOne only needs to watch how the story of a young lad named Luke Skywalker unfolds to see this archetype at work and be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins as an innocent and ordinary young man , working for his aunt and uncle , when he is called to adventure upon their tragic deaths .\nHe is afraid at first , but takes on that call and soon meets with allies in the form of two droids , who help him along in his journey .\nHe also has wise older mentors to teach him the ways of the Jedi .\nHe crosses the threshold from his normal life into one of galactic adventure , where he runs into the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who he must do battle with , but first he enters the dark cave of truth where he comes face to face with his innermost fears .\nHe comes out to face the supreme ordeal , hitting bottom .\nThe abyss calls out to him .\nBut Luke seizes the sword and gets a reward for it , which drives him on to the journey home as a newly resurrected hero .\nThen , BOOM , before he makes it home , the biggest battle of all confronts him and he overcomes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wisdom .\nThen , finally , he heads back home with a treasure in hand , truly transformed , and is celebrated as a hero .\nThe most endearing , and enduring , forms of entertainment contain this journey in some form .\nThe genre might change from science fiction to western , but the bold elements are there in all their archetypal glory , and we respond accordingly .\nBut understanding archetypes intellectually doesn \u2019 t help much when we are struggling to fully express ourselves and actualise the authenticity we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archetypes are .\nBig deal .\nUnless we can find a way to apply this knowledge to bettering our lives , it really doesn \u2019 t matter much .\nIf a concept isn \u2019 t useful , we tend to toss it aside .\nHowever , when it comes to archetypes , we truly do have the ability to literally rewrite the stories of our lives if we know how .\nFirst we have to dig up the archetypes that operate us and put them under the microscope .\nAre they serving us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we even choose these archetypes in the first place , or were they chosen for us by other people with other agendas ?\nIt all begins with an honest appraisal of who we are , what our \u2018 story \u2019 is , and how we see ourselves in the eyes of others .\nFor some people , writing out the beats/defining moments of their own personal history can reveal telling patterns that may not be obvious on the surface .\nMeditating on our lives can do the same by shedding light where all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting down and reviewing our story becomes more honest and truthful , much in the same way someone in recovery undertakes a \u2018 fearless moral inventory \u2019 as part of the 12-step work .\nThis takes time and effort , but will show us exactly where patterns that still govern our actions and behaviours originated , and who planted them there .\nOnly then can we ask if those patterns are chosen by us , and if they are helping us achieve authenticity and fulfilment of the SELF\u2026 or keeping us under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mask we wear for the world .\nOne powerful way to see exactly what archetypes are active in our lives is to notice what we complain about the most .\n\u201c I am so tired of doing everything for everybody .\nWho helps me ?\n\u201d \u201c Why do I have to always repeat myself ?\nI feel like no one even listens to me or sees me ?\n\u201d \u201c I am sick of being a doormat for others to take advantage of.\n\u201d Any of those sound familiar ?\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VICTIM or MARTYR .\n\u201c I always have to be strong.\n\u201d \u201c I have to lead every situation because no one else steps up to the plate.\n\u201d You , my friend , have a WARRIOR imbalance .\nAnd that is key , because some of the archetypes within are positive , some are negative , and some are just in need of a little balance .\nWe all want to be warriors , but as shown above , when that archetype is too strong and active , we may need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to not feel taken for granted , burnt out or overwhelmed saving the world .\nEven WARRIORS need to be taken care of now and then .\nWe have all heard it said that it takes approximately 21 days to change a habit .\nWhen it comes to changing a negative archetype and replacing it with a more empowering one , we have to repeat ourselves and act as if .\nSay , for example , we want to replace the inner FOOL with a SAGE .\nWe must pretend at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that belief until it becomes habitual and embedded within the subconscious , and then the collective unconscious .\nWe may still behave as the FOOL now and then , but course correction is a part of archetypal work and it won \u2019 t happen overnight .\nKnowing that , we can move forward to creating a new \u2018 vision \u2019 of who we are that is more aligned with our authentic SELF , and not the PERSONA we have been wearing just to survive .\nGuided visualisation can assist us in meeting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change or eliminate , and also to further empower the archetypes we like and that work for our greater good .\nThose who follow the teachings of the laws of attraction can attest to the power of words to define us .\nWhen we want to change our lives , and the symbols that we operate by , we must watch what we say as well as what we do .\nThe words we choose to describe ourselves are telling .\n\u201c I am _________ \u201d Fill in the blank .\nWhat we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what we manifest .\nYet is it accurate , or again , imposed upon us from our childhoods by those who decided to label and categorise us as they saw fit ?\nIn the recovery movement , standing up and saying \u201c I am an alcoholic \u201d or \u201c I am an addict \u201d is a powerful part of admitting the truth and getting out of denial .\nBut are these labels ultimately keeping us stuck and associated with the very aspects we wish to change ?\nCan we rephrase these to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery ?\n\u201c I am a sober person.\n\u201d \u201c I am thriving without drugs.\n\u201d Even those who are cancer survivors are recognising the amazing power that choosing words can have on their ability to stay positive and possibly assist in healing .\n\u201c I am a cancer survivor \u201d is being replaced with \u201c I am a thriver , \u201d and the difference in the energy is palpable .\nThe great thing about working with archetypes is that we not only become more actualised and authentic individuals , but we contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the archetypes that are at play on a global scale from negative to positive if we do the hard individual work first .\nImagine a world that is more PEACEMAKER and less WARMONGER .\nCan we envision and work towards a planet of NURTURERS and CREATORS , neutralising the overwhelming power of the DESTROYERS and USERS ?\nThis world can certainly use more ARTISTS and LOVERS and VISIONARIES .\nBut first we must become those things on a personal level .\nArchetypes are working all the time in each of us , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By taking a look at where we are now , and whether or not we are living as we desire , we can get a good gauge on how much deep work is needed to take off the masks of the PERSONA and step into a more actualised SELF .\nSymbols and images are somewhat useless unless we can find a way to use them for growth and transformation .\nIf indeed a human life is a story , then each human has the ability to revise , rework and rewrite that story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he or she is .\nThat is the power of archetypes .\nThey shape the subconscious and form the substrate of the collective unconscious .\nWithout change on those levels , we can not change on the conscious level .\nWe must dive deep to the base of the iceberg and the dark murky ground upon which the base stands to really understand why we act , think and behave the way we do\u2026 and how we can once and for all tell the world the stories of our lives the way they @ @ @ @ @ @", "author": "WakingTimes",

over a viral pandemic that continues to wreak havoc with lives and the economy , threats of vaccine mandates and financial penalties for noncompliance , and discord over how to legislate the public good without sacrificing individual liberty .\nThe discord is getting more discordant by the day .\nJust recently , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that government officials should mandate mass vaccinations and deploy the National Guard \u201c to ensure that people without proof of vaccination would not be allowed , well , anywhere.\n\u201d In other words , lock up the unvaccinated and use the military to determine who gets to be \u201c free.\n\u201d These tactics have been used before .\nThis is why significant numbers of people are worried : because this is the slippery slope that starts with well-meaning intentions for the greater good and ends with tyrannical abuses no one should tolerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future might look like if such a policy were to be enforced , look beyond America \u2019 s borders .\nIn Italy , the unvaccinated are banned from restaurants , bars and public transportation , and could face suspensions from work and monthly fines .\nSimilarly , France will ban the unvaccinated from most public venues .\nIn Austria , anyone who has not complied with the vaccine mandate could face fines up to $ 4100 .\nPolice will be authorized to carry out routine checks and demand proof of vaccination , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for failure to do so .\nIn China , which has adopted a zero tolerance , \u201c zero COVID \u201d strategy , whole cities\u2014some with populations in the tens of millions\u2014are being forced into home lockdowns for weeks on end , resulting in mass shortages of food and household supplies .\nReports have surfaced of residents \u201c trading cigarettes for cabbage , dishwashing liquid for apples and sanitary pads for a small pile of vegetables .\nOne resident traded a Nintendo Switch console for a packet of instant noodles and two steamed buns.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 , China has constructed \u201c quarantine camps \u201d throughout the country : massive complexes boasting thousands of small , metal boxes containing little more than a bed and a toilet .\nDetainees\u2014including children , pregnant women and the elderly\u2014 were reportedly ordered to leave their homes in the middle of the night , transported to the quarantine camps in buses and held in isolation .\nIf this last scenario sounds chillingly familiar , it should .\nEighty years ago , another authoritarian regime established more than 44,000 quarantine camps for those perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : racially inferior , politically unacceptable or simply noncompliant .\nWhile the majority of those imprisoned in the Nazi concentration camps , forced labor camps , incarceration sites and ghettos were Jews , there were also Polish nationals , gypsies , Russians , political dissidents , resistance fighters , Jehovah \u2019 s Witnesses , and homosexuals .\nCulturally , we have become so fixated on the mass murders of Jewish prisoners by the Nazis that we overlook the fact that the purpose of these concentration camps were initially intended to \u201c incarcerate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cultural movements that the Nazis perceived to be a threat to the survival of the regime.\n\u201d As the U.S .\nHolocaust Memorial Museum explains : How do you get from there to here , from Auschwitz concentration camps to COVID quarantine centers ?\nYou don \u2019 t have to be unvaccinated or a conspiracy theorist or even anti-government to be worried about what lies ahead .\nYou just have to recognize the truth in the warning : power corrupts , and absolute power corrupts absolutely .\nThis is not about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , populist movements , or any particular country .\nThis is about what happens when good , generally decent people\u2014distracted by manufactured crises , polarizing politics , and fighting that divides the populace into warring \u201c us vs. them \u201d camps\u2014fail to take note of the looming danger that threatens to wipe freedom from the map and place us all in chains .\nIt \u2019 s about what happens when any government is empowered to adopt a comply-or-suffer-the-consequences mindset that is enforced through mandates , lockdowns , penalties , detention centers , martial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of the individual .\nThe slippery slope begins in just this way , with propaganda campaigns about the public good being more important than individual liberty , and it ends with lockdowns and concentration camps .\nThe danger signs are everywhere .\nClaudio Ronco , a 66-year-old Orthodox Jew and a specialist in 18th-century music , recognizes the signs .\nBecause of his decision to remain unvaccinated , Ronco is trapped inside his house , unable to move about in public without a digital vaccination card .\nHe can no longer board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eat at a restaurant or get a coffee at a bar .\nHe has been ostracized by friends , shut out of public life , and will soon face monthly fines for insisting on his right to bodily integrity and individual freedom .\nFor all intents and purposes , Ronco has become an undesirable in the eyes of the government , forced into isolation so he doesn \u2019 t risk contaminating the rest of the populace .\nThis is the slippery slope : a government empowered to restrict movements , limit individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent the spread of a disease is a government that has the power to lockdown a country , label whole segments of the population a danger to national security , and force those undesirables\u2014a.k.a .\nextremists , dissidents , troublemakers , etc.\u2014into isolation so they don \u2019 t contaminate the rest of the populace .\nThe world has been down this road before , too .\nOthers have ignored the warning signs .\nWe can not afford to do so .\nAs historian Milton Mayer recounts in his seminal book on Hitler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thought They Were Free : The German people chose to ignore the truth and believe the lie .\nThey were not oblivious to the horrors taking place around them .\nAs historian Robert Gellately points out , \u201c [ A ] nyone in Nazi Germany who wanted to find out about the Gestapo , the concentration camps , and the campaigns of discrimination and persecutions need only read the newspapers.\n\u201d The warning signs were there , blinking incessantly like large neon signs .\nHalf a century later , the wife of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were members of the Nazi party , opined : \u201c [ O ] n the whole , everyone felt well .\n.\n.\n.\nAnd there were certainly eighty percent who lived productively and positively throughout the time .\n.\n.\n.\nWe also had good years .\nWe had wonderful years.\n\u201d In other words , as long as their creature comforts remained undiminished , as long as their bank accounts remained flush , as long as they weren \u2019 t being locked up , locked down , discriminated against , persecuted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripped , jailed or killed , life was good .\nLife is good in America , too , as long as you \u2019 re able to keep cocooning yourself in political fantasies that depict a world in which your party is always right and everyone else is wrong , while distracting yourself with bread-and-circus entertainment that bears no resemblance to reality .\nIndeed , life in America may be good for the privileged few who aren \u2019 t being locked up , locked down , discriminated against , persecuted , starved , beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed , but it \u2019 s getting worse by the day for the rest of us .\nWhich brings me back to the present crisis : COVID-19 is not the Holocaust , and those who advocate vaccine mandates , lockdowns and quarantine camps are not Hitler , but this still has the makings of a slippery slope .\nThe means do not justify the ends : we must find other ways of fighting a pandemic without resorting to mandates and lockdowns and concentration camps .\nTo do otherwise is to lay the groundwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wreak havoc .\nIf we do not want to repeat the past , then we must learn from past mistakes .\nJanuary 27 marks Remembrance Day , the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau , a day for remembering those who died at the hands of Hitler \u2019 s henchmen and those who survived the horrors of the Nazi concentration camps .\nYet remembering is not enough .\nWe can do better .\nWe must do better .\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America : The War on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Erik Blair Diaries , the world is teetering on the edge of authoritarian madness .\nAll it will take is one solid push for tyranny to prevail .\nConstitutional attorney and author John W.

latest Waking Times articles delivered to your inbox .\nSign up here .\nThe third eye is a metaphor for perception beyond ordinary sight .\nThis article argues that to achieve perception beyond ordinary sight , we must take extraordinary leaps of courage out of the ordinary .\nIn short : we must remythologize mystery , dare to lift the veil , and courageously turn our own riddle against the universal riddle .\nLet \u2019 s break it down .\nWe are all driving blind through an impossibly complex maze that we all know ends in a head-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us up to fail .\nSo , when it really comes down to it , the real question is : do we fail greatly or poorly ?\nDo we enjoy the challenge of the maze , with all its ups and downs , tragedy and majesty , trial and error ?\nOr do we balk , defeated and demoralized , and filled with regret and self-pity ?\nGuilt and regret are unnecessary .\nThey are gasoline poured on the fire of unchangeable circumstance .\nThey are just an added layer of unnecessary suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , but we can control how we react to it .\nBetter to roast marshmallows over it in good humor than pour gasoline over it in angst .\nBetter to suffer greatly than to suffer poorly .\nSuffering greatly is allowing na\u00efve , innocent , and ignorant mythology to die and then creating updated , innovative , wise mythology out of it .\nSuffering poorly is clinging to naivete , innocence , and ignorance and never taking a leap of courage out of faith and into fortitude .\nMyths have the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to give meaning to the mundane .\nWe are mythological creatures .\nWe need myth like we need food .\nBut myths must change to remain digestible , relevant , and empowering enough to keep us ahead of the curve of a fallible human condition and an indifferent cosmos .\nRemythologizing mythology itself is a way to stay ahead of the curve .\nMythmaking is world-building .\nWhen you are a world-builder , you are equal parts divining rod and lightning rod .\nYou \u2019 re able to open-up to unexpected music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intuitive hunches and looking for primordial signs in all domains of thought .\nThe third eye blasts open .\nMost of all , you \u2019 re able to build upon this teleology in an attempt to move your personified Fibonacci sequence ( striving finitude ) ever closer to the unreachable Phi ( enlightenment ) .\nYou are able to explain the numinous through the primal medium of storytelling , art , and myth .\nMythmaking is sacred reach .\nIt \u2019 s a way of realigning our unhealthy cultural story with the healthier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of transforming the dogmatic into the enigmatic .\nIt helps others realize that remaining enchanted and maintaining our awe regarding the Great Mystery\u2014rather than vainly trying to pigeonhole it into man-made laws\u2014is always the truer providence .\nIf , as Maya Angelou said , \u201c Without courage you can \u2019 t practice any other virtue consistently , \u201d then it stands to reason that we allow courage to be the bedrock of our excellence .\nWithout the initial leap of courage there is no freedom .\nHence , there can be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely restricted to the conventional , inhibited by the whims of others , imprisoned inside the box of the status quo , and hampered by outdated reasoning .\nWithout courage , the third eye remains calcified , hard , blind .\nThird eye illumination requires ego-annihilation , a tearing of the veil .\nThis is a psychological destruction , a creative destruction .\nSimilar to the way a caterpillar gets annihilated in the cocoon and then put back together again in the form of a butterfly , an ego-centric perspective gets annihilated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and then comes back together again in the form of a soul-centric perspective .\nBut unlike the caterpillar which acts on instinct to create its cocoon , the human animal must act on courage to create their cocoon phase .\nThis requires a leap of courage out of faith and into fortitude .\nThree leaps , in particular : the courage to question the self , the courage to destroy the self , and the courage to rebirth the self .\nProactively stretching our comfort zone , tearing the veil , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes here and there keeps us ahead of our destiny and manifests adventure .\nIt is the difference between being the change you wish to see in the world and expecting the world to change without personal sacrifice .\nThe former will always be superior to the latter .\nSure , it \u2019 s risky .\nBut healthy progress always is .\nAs Kierkegaard profoundly stated , \u201c To dare is to lose one \u2019 s footing momentarily .\nNot to dare is to lose oneself.\n\u201d Dare to lift the veil .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ distanced approach to yourself .\nDetach yourself from yourself .\nPlay with appearances like a juggler juggling personas .\nBecome many different people .\nBe a chameleon\u2014Protean , adaptable , fluid\u2014susceptible of reflecting the atmosphere around you .\nWith such a flexible approach to all appearances , you will lose a lot of the heaviness that weighs most people down .\nYou will become a mirror : the heart of the third eye .\nLosing heaviness is the first step toward lightheartedness and a good sense of humor .\nWith a light heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe become detached enough from direct experience to reveal the wizard behind the curtain .\nWe become much needed medicine\u2014vital , primal , and primordial .\nWe make the darkness lighter .\nWe dim the too-bright lights .\nWe lift the burden of seriousness that we \u2019 ve become so accustomed to .\nWe reveal alternative ways of being human in the world .\nThe almighty riddle we are locked inside is the indifferent universe .\nThe universe is utterly indifferent to our deference .\nAnd yet we have no choice but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is there a way to flip the script ?\nIs there a way to gain a sense of humor so powerful that it gets power over power itself ?\nYes .\nWe must gain the radical humor of stoic indifference .\nStoicism teaches us how to accept the conditions of an indifferent reality and then one-up it with our own indifferent attitude in return .\nRadical indifference compels us to detach .\nIn our detachment we see how everything is attached .\nWe see how the riddle has us mesmerized .\nWe break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riddle despite .\nThis is the power of meaning creation , and the essence of grace and serenity .\nWhen you get above it all\u2014all the pettiness , all the petty placation , all the woe-is-me pity , all the codependent expectation\u2014you become enigmatic , otherworldly , heroic .\nYou are able to untie Gordian Knots , square circles , flip scripts , turn tables , and reimagine Imagination itself .\nYour indifference in response to the universal indifference creates transcendent interdependence .\nThe third eye blasts wide open , bloodshot and thirsty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long .\nBetween indifference and deference there is a third thing : imagination .\nAs Nietzsche said , \u201c No artist tolerates reality.\n\u201d Imagination is that place where , as Jung intuited , \u201c reason and understanding unite with unreason and magic.\n\u201d It \u2019 s a transcendent state .\nIt \u2019 s where Einstein rode on a photon of light .\nIt \u2019 s where Prometheus stole fire from the gods .\nIt \u2019 s where the pen is mightier than the sword .\nReimagining imagination is radical indifference .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s embracing process over progress .\nFocusing on the process keeps us grounded .\nIt keeps us action-oriented rather than results-oriented .\nIt keeps us from taking ourselves too seriously .\nBut it also keeps us between worlds .\nIt keeps us flexible , adaptable , and detached .\nWhen we achieve an indifferent state of reimagined imagination , we \u2019 re in an open-minded state of process over progress .\nWe \u2019 re in Flow .\nWe \u2019 re in the zone .\nWe \u2019 re woolgathering black sheep transcending sheepishness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposites\u2014the ultimate catalyzing agent\u2014within whom summit and abyss , shadow and light , life and death , are united .\nThus , we liberate our third eye .\nWe free ourselves up for further freedom .\nWe gain perception beyond ordinary sight .\nGary \u2018 Z \u2019 McGee , a former Navy Intelligence Specialist turned philosopher , is the author of Birthday Suit of God and The Looking Glass Man .\nHis works are inspired by the great philosophers of the ages and his wide awake view of

.\nSign up here .\nAn experience and/or sensation that people are having in greater frequency recently is that of being in a \u2018 different reality \u2019 from other people .\nI have heard it spoken that someone can be standing right next to another person and yet it feels like both are living in a completely different reality .\nIs this a new human condition \u2013 the \u2018 split-reality syndrome \u2019 ?\nAnd if so , what are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the one hand , there is little doubt that humanity \u2013 yes , that means human life upon this planet \u2013 is experiencing monumental shifts and disturbances that include such aspects as : earth changes/disruptions , non-linear climatic variations , economic vulnerabilities and fluctuations , national political system failures , geo-political fractures , infrastructure breakdowns , global power grabs , mind programming , technocratic control systems , and much more .\nAnd on the other hand , we are witnessing an immense shift in peoples \u2019 awareness , understanding , and perceptual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the domain of discussing \u2018 big shifts \u2019 \u2013 and this is a time for experiencing large themes \u2013 let me bring forward two \u2018 big words \u2019 to frame this : Apocalypse & Armageddon .\nThese two words have , in recent times , been coming up repeatedly in spoken and written narratives and conversations .\nAnd often , they have been used interchangeably .\nAnd the reason for this is that on a very general level , both terms are used to refer to an \u2018 end times \u2019 destructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad context , describe an end time , or end of the world , scenario .\nAnd with the current state of the world as it today , and its potential future trajectory , it is understandable that people are using these terms in conversation .\nYet , for me , they each represent a different aspect of this \u2018 split-reality.\n\u2019 So , I am going to lay out what , for me , these terms represent and how they play into a different reality scenario for each .\nThe term apocalypse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apok\u00e1lypsis ) which literally means \u2018 from cover ; \u2019 that is , a disclosure or revelation of great knowledge .\nIn religious terminology it has been used to denote a disclosure of something very important that was hidden .\nThis may refer to some \u2018 heavenly secrets , \u2019 or similar divine disclosures that may bring understanding onto earthly life .\nHere then , we have a term representing a \u2018 revelation of the veiled.\n\u2019 In such an instance of an apocalypse , we have a moment of individual and/or collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nDoes this match with the term \u2018 Armageddon \u2019 ?\nArmageddon , in ancient Greek is \u1f09\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd , Harmaged\u014dn ( and in Hebrew is\u05b9\u200e Har M\u0259g\u012bdd\u014d ) which is the prophesied location of a battle during the \u2018 end times.\n\u2019 Again , the term Armageddon is used in a general sense to refer to any \u2018 end of the world \u2019 scenario .\nYet it has no revelatory significance or suggests any epiphany .\nIt refers to a physical battle , a time of great end times war \u2013 the \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can see , these two terms represent two distinct moments : one is an instance of revelation ( apocalypse ) , and the other is a specific physical \u2018 war to end all wars \u2019 ( Armageddon ) .\nFor me , how people use these terms ( if they do at all ) , and also the presence of these terms in the same narrative , signifies this \u2018 split-reality \u2019 positioning .\nIn other words , a person can position themselves within a reality of revelation , a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them \u2013 a perceptual awakening .\nOr , a person can perceive themselves to be caught up with a time of physical warfare , disruption , and destruction .\nFor me , one of these realities allows for a refinement of self-awareness , cognition , and comprehension ; the other , a densification , entanglement , and potential disturbance of one \u2019 s cognition and energy state .\nFurthermore , the apocalypse mode ( to call it that ) represents , to my understanding , a movement towards something .\nA person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perceptual awareness , or space of knowing .\nAnd the Armageddon mode is more likely to suggest a running away from something \u2013 running away from the destruction and devastation of war .\nHere , these positionings can also be applied to how people are reacting to one or other of possible future \u2018 reality states.\n\u2019 In these days we are being told to \u2018 prepare for what is coming.\n\u2019 Yet what is coming ?\nHow can we really know what is going to come \u2013 World War 3 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is most likely that we shall meet exactly what we are preparing for .\nIn my short life experience , I have found that we tend to meet reality halfway ( most of the time ! )\n.\nSo , in this scenario , if we are stockpiling food , digging our bunkers , and fearing for the worst \u2013 what I have called the \u2018 Armageddon-pathogen-virus-zombie-endgame \u2019 meme [ i ] \u2013 then we \u2019 re more likely to run into one of those demonic zombies , or an experience affiliated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to experience fear , confusion , anxiety , uncertainty , etc , if this is what they are preparing against .\nBecause this structure has become their reality set .\nReality has a funny way of responding to what \u2019 s in our heads \u2013 yet most often in a way that we were not expecting .\n[ ii ] What we are running away from usually meets us head on , at some point .\nJust like in our abstract dreams : we are running away from some fear but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , suggests a position of receptibility and openness to unknown potentials , without fear or apprehension , yet with an inner sense of trust .\nFor you see , we can not run away from ourselves no matter how fast or how hard we try .\nWe can take ourselves to an underground bunker , or to some isolated island \u2013 yet we take ourselves with us .\nAnd \u2018 how \u2019 we are is what determines how we experience what is to be and what is to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the opening sentence , we can be standing right next to another person and yet each person is experiencing and living in a different reality \u2013 and responding to this accordingly .\nWe can be physically next to them , but we are certainly not with them .\nWhether we have recognized it , and acknowledged it , or not \u2013 reality has split .\nAnd it is time to choose our positions .\nHow we take ourselves forward from this moment on will determine what form and arrangement of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are going to experience .\nNot everyone will be a part of our reality \u2013 yet many will .\nWe can not include all people in our reality , for this will be an individual choice to make , just as you will , or have already , made yours .\nReality is about alignment .\nOur experiences have a way of meeting us halfway , or someway , in alignment with our state of being .\nIt might not all be rosy .\nDiscomfort is also a hereditary aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future unfolds , and no one can say for sure on this , it will be a question of how you choose to meet it .\nAnd that will depend upon which reality you have stepped into .\nIs your future going to be a revelation of hidden truths leading to new understandings and life patterns ; or are you battle-ready for the war to end all wars ?\nIf you \u2019 re not yet sure , then take a little time to think about it .\nBut not too much time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt \u2019 s going to be a critical choice .\nKingsley L.

designed to persuade \u201c vaccine-hesitant \u201d individuals to get the COVID-19 vaccine .\nNone of the messaging examined by researchers involves conveying factual evidence that supports the claims \u2014 widely disseminated by Big Pharma , Big Media and public health agencies \u2014 that the vaccines are \u201c safe \u201d and \u201c effective.\n\u201d Researchers last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial involving two survey experiments on how to manufacture consent for COVID vaccines .\nThe Yale-sponsored study , \u201c Persuasive messaging to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake intentions , \u201d examined how different persuasive messages affected 1 ) intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine , 2 ) willingness to persuade friends and relatives to get the vaccine , 3 ) fear of those who have not been vaccinated , and 4 ) social judgment of people who choose not to vaccinate .\nAccording to the study \u2019 s authors : \u201c Given the considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficacy of a COVID-19 vaccine , it has become increasingly important to understand how public health communication can play a role in increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake.\n\u201d The paper did not address the underlying reasons someone might have concerns about the safety or efficacy of COVID vaccines but focused instead exclusively on how to persuade them to get the vaccine .\n\u201c We conducted two pre-registered experiments to study how different persuasive messages affect intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine , willingness to persuade friends and relatives to receive one , and negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccinate .\n\u201c In the first experiment , we tested the efficacy of a large number of messages against an untreated control condition \u2026 In Experiment 2 , we retested the most effective messages from Experiment 1 on a nationally representative sample of American adults.\n\u201d The messages tested by the researchers have been woven into mainstream media narratives and public health campaigns throughout the world .\nBut the study completion date for part 1 was July 8 , 2020 , which means all of these messages were created prior to the release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c To end the COVID-19 outbreak , it is important for people to get vaccinated against COVID-19 whenever a vaccine becomes available .\nGetting the COVID-19 vaccine means you are much less likely to get COVID-19 or spread it to others .\nVaccines are safe and widely used to prevent diseases and vaccines are estimated to save millions of lives every year.\n\u201d In order to establish which messaging strategies elicited an inclination to get vaccinated , 10 additional messages were added to bring context to the baseline message .\nThese messages incorporated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilt , embarrassment , anger , bravery , trust in science , personal freedom , economic freedom and community economic benefit .\n\u201c We find that persuasive messaging that invokes prosocial vaccination and social image concerns is effective at increasing intended uptake and also the willingness to persuade others and judgments of non-vaccinators , \u201d the researchers wrote .\nTo study the impacts of guilt , embarrassment and anger , researchers prompted people to think about how they would feel if they did not get vaccinated and then spread the virus to others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a role in cooperation , either by motivating an individual to take an action because of a feeling that they experience or restraining them from taking an action because of the emotional response it would provoke in others.\n\u201d The \u201c not brave \u201d and \u201c trust in sciences \u201d messages were designed to evoke concerns about reputation and social image .\nThe \u201c not brave \u201d message \u201c reframed the idea that being unafraid of the virus is not a brave action , but instead selfish , and that the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it shows strength and concern for others.\n\u201d The \u201c trust in science \u201d message suggested , \u201c those who do not get vaccinated do not understand science and signal this ignorance to others.\n\u201d Personal freedom , economic freedom and community economic benefit messages drew on concerns linked to COVID restrictions .\nOverall , it was a message that appealed to community interest , reciprocity and a sense of embarrassment that proved most persuasive , resulting in a 30 % increase in intention to vaccinate , a 24 % increase in willingness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a 38 % increase in negative opinions of people who decline the vaccines relative to the placebo message .\nCommunity interest messages that incorporate embarrassment were determined to be most effective in getting people to encourage others to get the vaccine , while \u201c not brave \u201d messaging showed the most promise in creating negative judgments of non-vaccinators .\nThe Yale study findings are consistent with another recent paper , \u201c Vaccination as a Social Contract , \u201d which demonstrated people view vaccination as a social contract and are less willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The experiments consistently showed that especially compliant ( i.e.\n, vaccinated ) individuals showed less generosity toward nonvaccinated individuals \u2026 It is concluded that vaccination is a social contract in which cooperation is the morally right choice .\n\u201c Individuals act upon the social contract , and more so the stronger they perceive it as a moral obligation .\nEmphasizing the social contract could be a promising intervention to increase vaccine uptake , prevent free riding , and , eventually , support the elimination of infectious diseases.\n\u201d Saad Omer , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has an extensive interest in public health messaging .\nHis efforts to combat vaccine hesitancy earned him a spot on the World Health Organization \u2019 s ( WHO ) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts working Group on COVID-19 Vaccines , the Sabine Vaccine Institute \u2019 s Board of Trustees and the WHO \u2019 s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety .\nIn 2020 , Omer initiated a \u201c Building Vaccine Confidence Through Tailored Messaging Campaigns \u201d project involving randomized trials in five countries using social media messaging to increase COVID and childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the first WHO Global Infodemiology Conference in June 2020 , Omer referenced \u201c moral foundation theory \u201d and suggested appealing to values could change decision-making behaviors .\nOmer provided details about a messaging study for the HPV vaccine and discussed how similar strategies could be applied to create compliance for COVID measures : \u201c We wanted to test out , can we have a purity-based message ?\nSo we showed them pictures of genital warts and described a vignette , a narrative , a story , talking about how someone got genital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how pure vaccines are that sort of restore the sanctity of the body .\n\u201c So we just analyzed these data .\nThis was a randomized control trial with apriori outcomes .\nWe found approximately 20 percentage point effect on people \u2019 s likelihood of getting an HPV vaccine in the next 6 months \u2026 \u201c We are trying out liberty-based messages or liberty-mediated messaging around this behavior related to COVID-19 outbreak .\nThat wearing a mask or taking precautions eventually make you free , regain your autonomy .\nBecause if the disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resume.\n\u201d The \u2018 science \u2019 of infodemiology , infoveillance and infodemic Omer is one of many prominent voices in what is known as the field of \u201c infodemiology , \u201d a term coined in 2002 by Dr. Gunter Eysenbach .\nAs the first infodemiologist and founder of the Journal of Medical Internet Research , Eysenbach defines infodemiology as \u201d the science of distribution and determinants of information in an electronic medium , specifically the Internet , or in a population , with the ultimate aim to inform public health and public policy.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ infoveillance , \u201d defined as \u201c a type of syndromic surveillance that specifically utilizes information found online , \u201d and \u201c infodemic , \u201d which refers to \u201c an overabundance of information \u201d that generally includes deliberate attempts to disseminate wrong information to undermine the public health response and advance alternative agendas of groups or individuals.\n\u201d Using just three words , Eysenbach created a scientific niche , identified a problem and proposed at least part of a so-called solution .\nThe WHO readily embraced this language during the pandemic .\nAn editorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lancet began with a quote from WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus : \u201c We \u2019 re not just fighting a pandemic ; we \u2019 re fighting an infodemic.\n\u201d The WHO hosted several infodemiology conferences throughout the pandemic .\nAsserting that \u201c misinformation costs lives , \u201d the WHO , the United Nations and other groups created the perfect justification for social media surveillance and the suppression of dissent .\nIn 2020 , the WHO created a resolution asking member states to take measures to leverage digital technologies to counter \u201c misinformation \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 50 digital companies and social media platforms , including TikTok and even Tinder , to support these efforts .\nThe efforts to eliminate \u201c misinformation \u201d resulted in unprecedented censorship of virtually anything that steps outside of state-sanctioned consensus and the creation of a captive audience primed to accept a singular narrative .\nA National Defense Authorization Act amendment in 2012 that legalized the use of propaganda on the American public makes it easier for governments to create self-serving narratives .\nAnd thanks to a multi-billion dollar budget from the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HHS ) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , we are under the influence of the best messages money can buy \u2014 whether or not those messages are true .\nThis is likely why the CDC , public health departments and mainstream media can make broad assertions like this : \u201c COVID-19 vaccines were developed quickly while maintaining the highest safety standard possible , \u201d and this : \u201c Hydroxychloroquine shouldn \u2019 t be used to treat COVID-19 , \u201d and claim they are \u201c fact.\n\u201d Articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly removed if they \u2019 re even permitted to be published in the first place .\nYale is not the only university researching the science of compliance .\nAcademic institutions and government agencies throughout the world are immersed in this emerging behavioral science .\nIn February 2021 , the University of Pennsylvania newsletter , Penn Today , published , \u201c When the Message Matters , Use Science to Craft It , \u201d covering behavioral scientist Jessica Fishman \u2019 s Message Effects Lab ( MEL ) initiative and research related to \u201c what sways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID vaccination and testing .\nMEL currently has partnerships and ongoing projects with the World Bank , the National Institutes of Health , the CDC , Penn Medicine , The Children \u2019 s Hospital of Philadelphia , Independence Blue Cross/Blue Shield and the Government of Canada to address health-related behaviors .\nThe Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , a branch of HHS , also sponsored research to explore influences on COVID vaccine decision-making .\nThe study , \u201c Attitudes Toward a Potential SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine : A Survey of U.S.\nAdults , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial proportion ( 42.2 % ) of participants in a national survey conducted during the coronavirus pandemic would be hesitant to accept vaccination against COVID-19 .\nBlack race was one of the strongest independent predictors of not accepting vaccination ; this is especially alarming , given the outsized impact of COVID-19 among African-Americans .\n\u201c Our findings suggest that many of the individuals who responded \u2018 not sure \u2019 may accept vaccination if given credible information that the vaccine is safe and effective .\nAs vaccine development proceeds at an unprecedented pace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foster vaccine acceptance are needed to achieve control of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u201d Behavioral scientist Dr. Rupali Limaye took the messaging a step further .\nShe teaches a free online training course , offered by Johns Hopkins University , that \u201c prepares parents of school-age children , PTAs , community members and school staff to be Vaccine Ambassadors and promote vaccine acceptance in their communities.\n\u201d Limaye will be a panelist for an interactive webinar \u201c Making COVID-19 vaccines APPEALing : Pilot message testing in India , \u201d later this month .\nWhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unsupported beliefs about vaccine safety and efficacy , they appear to recognize the importance of constantly revisiting their understanding of the impacts of messaging .\nUPenn \u2019 s updated research found intentions around vaccination have changed .\nThe university \u2019 s Annenberg School for Communication reported : \u201c The researchers found that trust in scientific institutions and health authorities was central to individuals \u2019 intentions to be vaccinated , especially in the early part of the pandemic .\nHowever , as the pandemic continued , other factors related to trust emerged \u2026 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u2018 documents the need for the public health community to redouble its efforts to preemptively and persistently communicate not only about how vaccines in general work but also about their benefits , safety , and effectiveness.\n\u2019 \u201d Research from Civics Analytics , a technology company that creates data-driven audience campaigns , seconds the notion that effective messaging must evolve .\nWith funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , the company explored COVID concerns among different demographics and determined that a \u201c one-size-fits-all \u201d message would not work .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2021 , before the Delta variant emerged in the U.S. and when vaccine mandates had not yet been implemented , we found that messages highlighting experiences that are off-limits to unvaccinated individuals ( such as concerts or international travel ) or emphasizing personal choice were most persuasive\u2026 \u201c As you \u2019 ll see in this research , the most persuasive messages have changed.\n\u201d According to Civics Analytics , FOMO ( fear of missing out ) and \u201c personal decision \u201d messages were the most impactful .\nBut more current data indicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become more effective at persuading people to get vaccinated .\n\u201c For general messaging targeting all unvaccinated people , focus on protecting children from COVID-19 and on the financial ramifications of contracting the virus.\n\u201d The company found \u201c vaccine safety , \u201d \u201c scary COVID statistics \u201d and \u201c personal story \u201d messages were inclined to backfire and could decrease the likelihood of vaccinating .\nPerhaps some good scientists will advance the learning curve and study what happens when the public discovers that \u201c proven messages \u201d lack supporting scientific data .", "author": "WakingTimes", "url":

to \u201c slow the spread \u201d is over .\nUnfortunately , a new meta-analysis of studies shows that all the pain and sacrifice we endured from those orders achieved little\u2014despite their tremendous costs .\nThe new research review was led by economist Steve Hanke and published by Johns Hopkins University .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the impact of stay-at-home orders , and the effectiveness of specific restrictions .\nThe meta-analysis concludes that \u201c lockdowns have had little to no effect on COVID-19 mortality.\n\u201d Why wouldn \u2019 t stay-at-home mandates effectively combat the pandemic ?\nWell , to some extent they simply delayed the inevitable .\nPlus , research has shown that most COVID-19 spread actually occurred at home .\n\u201c Micro evidence contradicts the public-health ideal in which households would be places of solitary confinement and zero transmission , \u201d University of Chicago economist Casey B.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence suggests that \u2018 households show the highest transmission rates \u2019 and that \u2018 households are high-risk settings for the transmission of [ COVID-19 ] .\n\u2019 \u201d So , however disheartening it may be , it \u2019 s hardly surprising that Hanke and co. found such minimal public health impact from lockdown policies .\n\u201c Stringency index studies find that lockdowns in Europe and the United States only reduced COVID-19 mortality by 0.2 % on average , \u201d their new research concludes .\n\u201c [ Stay-in-place orders ] were also ineffective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on average .\nSpecific [ non-pharmaceutical restriction ] studies also find no broad-based evidence of noticeable effects on COVID-19 mortality.\n\u201d But the costs of these draconian measures weren \u2019 t minimal at all .\nThey devastated the economy , pummeled the working class , fueled a youth mental health crisis , led to record-breaking drug overdoses , worsened a crime wave , delayed life-saving medical treatments , and so much more .\nThese devastating results offer a vivid reminder of a crucial lesson .\nWhen central planners , in their hubris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sweeping consequences beyond their intentions , human suffering ensues .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not enough\u2026 to endorse legislation that has a nice title and promises to do something good , \u201d economist Robert P. Murphy wrote for FEE .\n\u201c People need to think through the full consequences of a policy , because often it will lead to a cure worse than the disease.\n\u201d When it comes to lockdown policies , the \u201c cure \u201d has indeed proven far more harmful than helpful .\nLike Waking Times on Facebook .\n@ @ @ @ @ @", "author": "WakingTimes", "url": "https://www.wakingtimes.com/lockdowns-had-little-to-no-effect-on-covid-mortality-new-johns-hopkins-study/", "published": "Mon, 07 Feb 2022 13:00:43 +0000", "published_utc": 1644256843, "collection_utc": 1644280959}, {"id": "wakingtimes--2022-02-08--International Group Of Attorneys Proceed With Covid-19 Crimes Against Humanity Grand Jury", "date": "2022-02-08", "source": "wakingtimes", "title": "International Group Of Attorneys Proceed With Covid-19 Crimes Against Humanity Grand Jury", "content": "International Group Of Attorneys Proceed With Covid-19 Crimes Against Humanity Grand Jury Get the latest Waking Times articles delivered to your inbox .\nSign up here .\nA collective of lawyers and attorneys , and one judge , from around the globe representing an independent organization known as the People \u2019 s Court of Public Opinion on behalf of the German based Corona investigative Committee , have come together to begin criminal investigation proceedings to present what they allege to be evidence of crimes against humanity committed by policy makers in response of the covid-19 pandemic .\nThe Grand Jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the present moment it holds no legitimate legal standing .\nHowever , the aim of this undertaking is to provide to a grand jury , in this case the general public , throughout the proceedings , legal statements and evidentiary materials \u2014 including testimony , affirming that willful criminal activity took place on behalf of the accused .\nIn hopes that the exposure of this evidence may provoke actual criminal charges and indictments in the future .\nThe committee consists of Attorney at Law Virginie de Araujo Recchia , ( France ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Portugal ) ; Attorney at Law Claire Deeks , ( New Zealand ) ; Attorney at Law Viviane Fischer , ( Germany ) ; .Attorney at Law Dr. Reiner Fuellmich , ( Germany ) ; Attorney at Law N.

and policy makers , stating \u2014 On Saturday , February 5th , the committee convened to issue opening statements beginning with Dr. Reiner Fuellmich .\nDuring the course of the proceedings Dr. Fuellmich asserted the following \u2014 \u201c But when you put together all those pieces of the puzzle as we will do for you with the help of renowned experts , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One , there is no corona pandemic , but only a PCR test \u2018 plandemic \u2019 fueled by an elaborate psychological operation designed to create a constant state of panic among the world \u2019 s population , \u201d explained Fuellmich .\n\u201c This agenda has been long-planned.\n\u201d \u201c Its ultimately unsuccessful precursor was the swine flu some 12 years ago , and it was cooked up by a group of super rich psychopathic and sociopathic people who hate and fear people at the same time , have no empathy , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control over all of us , the people of the world , \u201d he continued , adding that they \u2019 re using \u201c governments and the mainstream media \u201d to spread \u201c panic propaganda 24/7.\n\u201d Fuellmich went on to mention the coordinated deliberate suppression of effective covid-19 treatments such as vitamin C , vitamin D , zinc , Ivermectin , and hydroxychloroquine .\nDone so by an establishment determined to prioritize \u201c ineffective and lethal experimental injections \u201d .\nThen going on to acknowledge what we here at The Rundown Live have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of governmental institutions the world over by globalist bodies such as the World Economic Forum .\n\u201c Our governments are not our governments anymore , rather they have been taken over by the other side through their main platform , the World Economic Forum , which had started to create their own global leaders through their \u2018 Young Global Leaders \u2019 program as early as 1992 , \u201d Fuellmich said , adducing figures such as former German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Bill Gates as being among its first graduates .\nLater mentioning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This involves population control which , in their view , requires both a massive reduction of the population and manipulating the DNA of the remaining population with the help \u2013 for example \u2013 of mRNA experimental injections , \u201d And the replacement of national sovereignty with a more centralized globalist power structure ; Finally concluding with the recommendation of indictment of six key figures : Continuing , Fuellmich elaborates upon the panel of experts , to be presented in the coming weeks .\nIncluding former military insider James Bush , investigative journalist Whitney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Organization , British intelligence officials , and others to explain the historical and geopolitical significance of the ongoing crisis .\nBeginning with Operation Dark Winter , and continuing into the Rockefeller Lockstep Scenario , and Event201 into the current day .\nFurther adding to the testimony , the next group of witnesses will consist of an assortment of lung experts , professors , a pharmaceutical executive , and biologists ; who Fuellmich stated in part will \u2013 \u201c explain to us what is behind the legend of the Wuhan wet market outbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no more dangerous than the common flu .\nThe PCR test can not tell us anything about infections , but is the only basis for all anti-Corona measures , including the ultimate measure , the so-called vaccines and the so-called vaccines are not only ineffective , but extremely dangerous.\n\u201d The next group of experts comprised of doctors from around the world including Switzerland , Texas , South Africa , England , and Germany .\nAll who will attest to the misguided policies of government bodies intentionally suppressing effective treatments to mitigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nContinuing on , they will then call the next group of experts including Dr. Mike Eaton , professor Sucharit Bhakdi , and Dr. Robert Malone , among others from France and Germany .\nThe committee will further proceed by calling numerous experts from the US , France , Belgium , and Germany ; including renowned psychology professor Dr. Mattias Desmet .\nWho will elucidate the facts upon how various authoritarian measures were introduced into society and maintained through induced apathy via a massive psychological fear campaign .\nFinally concluding with the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economists from the United States and Germany to elaborate as to the controlled implosion of the world \u2019 s economy through the imposition of economically destructive measures .\nMoving towards a technocratic end goal of digital currency and global digital passport programs .\nAnd lastly , the committee will hear an assortment of testimonies including those from an investigative journalist , a Holocaust survivor , and a technocracy expert among them .\nSpecifically detailing the role of eugenics and depopulation .\nThough this committee has been nearly two years in the making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coming only days after the release of a bombshell report from John Hopkins University , coincidentally echoing much of the same sentiment , concluding once and for all that lockdowns were ineffective at preventing the spread of the virus .\nAdding to the continually mounting evidence asserting the same now causing a shift in public dialogue .\nAs reported previously , chief among any other coronavirus policy , lockdowns have arguably had the most devastating impact on civilization .\nNot only in facilitating the largest wealth transfer in history to the rich and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catastrophe pushing an excess of 130 million plus humans into poverty .\nBut also having disastrous consequences on public health , causing massive spikes in several mental health disorders , self harm , suicide , drug addiction and overdose , child abuse , domestic assault , starvation , and a slew of preventable deaths from untreated

told the police are making arrests in Ottawa .\nI assume this means they \u2019 re arresting truckers .\nThe Ottawa city government has declared a state of emergency .\nIt \u2019 s now a crime for anyone on the scene to give food , fuel , or aid of any kind to the truckers .\nThe truckers and people all over Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants peace without freedom .\nThe government wants vaccine mandates and passports , and the ability to declare lockdowns and other fascist measures at any time .\nNo debate on \u201c the science , \u201d no need to justify the COVID measures , no legal cases taking up Constitutional limits on government power .\nJust : OBEY .\nSo that \u2019 s what the government is .\nThat \u2019 s who they are .\nThat \u2019 s who Trudeau is .\nWe might feel shock at what the government is doing to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be surprised .\nNo one should have expected the government of \u201c obey us \u201d to just sit back and let this convoy happen and proceed , with so many Canadians supporting it .\nNo one should be surprised that rebellion against \u201c obey us \u201d governments is breaking out across the world .\nLet \u2019 s get out ahead of what could happen in the coming days and weeks\u2014- No one with a conscience should back away if governments and their media front men throw around words like \u201c insurrection \u201d and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THESE ARE CONTROL WORDS .\nThey \u2019 re meant to paralyze people .\nThey \u2019 re crude smears .\nThe implication would be , anyone who is \u201c a trucker \u201d or a \u201c supporter \u201d wants to overthrow the entire government\u2014rather than replace the fascists .\n\u201c Overthrow \u201d was the official characterization of the January 6 Capitol break-in , in the US .\n\u201c Well , led by a guy wearing a helmet and horns , a mob was going to take over the Congress.\n\u201d I see .\nSure .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having gained control over the PENTAGON , was going to swagger into the Capitol , declare martial law , and run the US with his junta .\nThereafter , The Rebels , commanded by a cigar-smoking fatigues-wearing Tony Fauci , encamped in the Catskills , would valiantly try to win back The Republic and the Constitution .\nThe truckers want freedom and peace , and their own right to earn a living .\nThe Canadian government wants peace without freedom for everyone , and they \u2019 re ready to use force to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks out in Ottawa , the government will be behind it .\nViolence shouldn \u2019 t make people back away from supporting the truckers .\nPerhaps you noticed that the George Floyd protests and riots and the looting and burning and violence in many US cities didn \u2019 t make anyone on the political Left back away from supporting the rioters .\nDid the government call those supporters insurrectionists or terrorists ?\nYou might hear this from people \u201c who are really in the know \u201d : \u201c You see , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then anyone who \u2019 s against the mandates and supports the truckers would be labeled a terrorist\u2026 \u201d Without real evidence , that formulation could be used to reject ANY form of mass protest on ANY issue .\nYou may as well say ALL OF LIFE IS A FALSE FLAG , and therefore , we should do nothing and support nothing .\nIf serious violence does break out in Ottawa , a typical shaming operation will launch : \u201c You people who supported the truckers\u2014you \u2019 re responsible for this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they were always breaking the law .\nThey were stirred up by a mob mentality , by you who won \u2019 t accept the reality of the pandemic and what we all have to do to return to normal life\u2026 \u201d Guilt by association , except it turns out the people we \u2019 re associated with\u2014the truckers\u2014did nothing wrong .\nAgain , if anyone has actual evidence to the contrary , evidence that shows there was a plan to launch a convoy that would dead-end in violence , and cause the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c THIS is what the protesters and the anti-vaxxers were about all along , they \u2019 re all crazy\u2026 \u201d , then present that evidence .\nI say this , because in the coming days , we could see and hear more of such talk .\nWhat I see in this convoy is honor , justice , the struggle for freedom .\nRemember : The convoy is a hell of a lot more than the truckers .\nIt \u2019 s all the Canadians who are supporting it .\nSo if a trucker is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a living , but he can \u2019 t cross the border unless he shows a vaccine passport , and he doesn \u2019 t want to take the vaccine , and that \u2019 s the sum of his protest ; fine .\nAnd if some trucker turns out to be bad actor , so what ?\nGET OUT AHEAD OF ALL THIS .\nGet all these things straight in your mind , because if the presence of many people and trucks in Ottawa endures , you \u2019 re going to be WORKED by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your thoughts and opinions and feelings .\nThat \u2019 s their job .\nThat \u2019 s how they operate .\nViolence is always a government \u2019 s hole card .\nThey play it , and then they say the rebels caused it or made it necessary .\nThey splash the violence on the news , because they know it scares many people , who then retreat .\nViolence serves another purpose .\nPeople want it to stop , so they look to the current political leadership to stop it .\nThey join forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the violence .\nIf among all the truckers , there are a few bad actors who are government agents , and they do initiate violence , the news will highlight them to the max .\nThis is pure Orwell 1984 stuff .\nPut pictures of the faces of \u201c the killers \u201d on the screen , over and over , with anchor voiceover telling the public what to see and think and feel .\nWith the goal of stimulating outrage .\nOutrage against everyone who supports the truckers or won \u2019 t take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandates .\nRemember what this is .\nA fight for freedom .\nHere \u2019 s something else that could happen .\nThe government suddenly announces a new wave of COVID cases .\nAnd the blame is directed at the throngs of unmasked truckers and their supporters out in the streets .\nSuper-spreaders .\nThe news , of course , would play that up .\nBy accusation and indirect suggestion , the public will be told THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS FEARED .\nThe unmonitored numbers of irresponsible persons rebelling against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law-abiding citizens .\nThat \u2019 s a straight con .\nDuring the past two years , it \u2019 s been played many times .\nDon \u2019 t be fooled .\nCase numbers can be rigged at the drop of a hat .\nThat \u2019 s been going on since the beginning of the \u201c pandemic.\n\u201d The pandemic story was planned with the sole purpose of canceling freedom .\nDon \u2019 t allow yourself to be manipulated .\nOne more suggestion .\nPlay out , in your mind , a worst-case scenario : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the intent to discredit actual freedom fighters and people who refuse the vaccine and oppose the COVID mandates and restrictions .\nGo ahead .\nMake a mind-movie of that .\nWhere does that lead you ?\nWhat \u2019 s the bottom line ?\nBecause all the people on the streets and in the trucks ARE for freedom ; and if the outcome is planned government-caused violence , that means NOTHING about what we \u2019 re fighting for .\nThat discredits NOTHING .\nIf we stand up .\nIf we make our voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words about a parallel event to the convoy , but I \u2019 ll keep it short .\nThe parallel event was the January 6 rally in Washington after the Presidential election , the rally that had nothing to do with the Capitol break-in .\nWhere hundreds of thousands of people gathered .\nThere were a number of ideas in the minds of all those people : a stolen election ; freedom from lockdowns and other fascist COVID restrictions ; opposition to the vaccine ; opposition to the self-appointed thought-police of America\u2026 In my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that massive show of loyalty .\nNot at all .\nI \u2019 ve explained why in other articles .\nBut the people who were there\u2014they were the important ones .\nRegardless of who planned the break-in and for what reasons .\nTHEY , the hundreds of thousands , wanted freedom .\nAnd still do .\nThe US government is trying to figure out every possible way to discredit and cancel them .\nNow .\nThis is the bigger picture .\nKeep your eye on it .\nI know .\nI \u2019 m not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rally .\nPeople who want freedom are supposed to forget that .\nHush hush .\nBecause THAT event has been slammed mercilessly and discredited and made into a foul horror show .\nBut I don \u2019 t care .\nAll over the world , the same pattern has been repeating .\nThe people who want to live out in the open and throw off their chains are being painted as criminals .\nFor whatever reasons can be cooked up .\nAnd no , not all protests are the same or are launched for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the core , the impulse and the foundation are there : WE \u2019 RE TAKING IT BACK .\nFREEDOM .\nThis isn \u2019 t Qanon crap or Trumpism or racism or craziness or any hustle .\nThe big smear , guilt by association , and all the other ops aren \u2019 t going to fool us .\nIf we don \u2019 t back down .\nIf we make our voices heard .", "author": "WakingTimes", "url":

and host of the show \u201c American Thought Leaders , \u201d investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson explains how virtually everything you see and hear online has been co-opted , or taken over to serve a greater agenda:1 The Information Landscape Is Being Controlled Attkisson calls out several common online sources that are heavily manipulated \u2014 Wikipedia , Snopes and most \u201c fact \u201d checkers to name a few , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fake science group used by Facebook and other Big Tech companies to debunk science that is actually true .\nFact checkers are often referred to as scientists , but this , too , is \u201c part of a very well-funded , well-organized landscape that dictates and slants the information they want us to have.\n\u201d While there have always been efforts to shape the information being given out by the media , it used to be that news reporters would push back against organizations to ensure the public had the other side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000s , Attkisson noted a shift from efforts to simply shape information to those that attempt to keep certain information from being reported at all .\nThis was particularly true among the pharmaceutical companies she was covering at that time .\nAttkisson described \u201c efforts by these large global PR firms that have been hired by the pharmaceutical industry , by government partners that work with the pharmaceutical industry , to keep the story from being reported at all.\n\u201d 2 Now , suppressing and censoring information that those in charge don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common .\nAttkisson believes the practice really took off in 2015 to 2016 , \u201c with Donald Trump proving to be a unique danger perceived by both Democrats and Republicans , and by that I mean by the interests that support and pay for them to be in office and make certain decisions.\n\u201d 3 With a wild card in office , a campaign was organized that exploited a media that was already conflicted and less apt to report what was actually going on .\n\u201c This all dovetailed together to create this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d she said .\nInstead of journalists seeking to uncover the truth , we have \u201c writers seeking to spread whatever establishment scientists or politicians want them to say , uncritically and at the expense , oftentimes , of accuracy.\n\u201d Now , instead of real journalists and reporters , the media is infiltrated with propagandists who dictate what \u2019 s \u201c fake news \u201d and what \u2019 s not .\nMany believe that fake news is a product of Trump , but Big Tech was brought into the campaign early on .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Facebook and said you \u2019 ve got to start censoring and \u201c fact \u201d checking information , Attkisson said .\nThe term \u201c fake news \u201d was popularized after Trump was elected , but it actually got its start before that \u2014 it was an invention of political activist website First Draft News , which is partially funded by Google.4 We \u2019 re in the midst of an information war where it \u2019 s difficult to tell truth from fiction or lies .\nJournalists are no longer the watchdogs ; instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then try to convince the public to believe that particular viewpoint .\nOther information that \u2019 s in conflict is censored or \u201c debunked.\n\u201d It \u2019 s an unusual time in history where efforts are even underway to manipulate the public to want their information censored and appreciate third-party \u201c fact \u201d -checkers , which were introduced as a tool to confuse and manipulate the public further.5 Yet , when you only hear one side of the story , and you can \u2019 t access other information to the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth \u2014 and that \u2019 s precisely the point .\nIs this all just a matter of reporters not knowing how to think critically and ask the right questions , or believing that they \u2019 re doing the right thing ?\nAttkisson states that it goes much deeper .\nA lot of propagandists have become part of the media , and while there used to be a firewall between reporters and the people they reported on , \u201c that \u2019 s long gone.\n\u201d She says:6 In early 2020 , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to everyone she could , including scientists with the government and outside the government .\n\u201c Pretty quickly , I could see that certain things that were being said publicly were bearing out as not true , and certain things that other scientists were telling me privately rang true , and in hindsight have actually been proven to be true.\n\u201d 7 Early on , quite a few scientists she talked to were questioning the advice being given by government scientists , including Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the president \u2019 s COVID response .\nShe asked them if they should say something and speak out about their concerns , but they all came back with the same response:8 Certainly , those scientists \u2019 opinions deserved to be heard , but the fear of speaking out silenced them .\nThey feared losing their grants , as most grants for research are funded by the government .\nIf the government doesn \u2019 t like what you say or do , you can get fired or never get a grant again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livelihood .\n\u201c That started to strike me as , this is a really dangerous environment , when esteemed scientists who have valuable information and opinions are afraid to give them , and instead we \u2019 re hearing a party line that many of them disagree with but won \u2019 t say so , \u201d Attkisson said.9 She mentioned the controversial U.S. government funding of gain-of-function research in China , and the notion that SARS-CoV-2 could have come from a Chinese laboratory \u2014 both were glaring issues that no one would talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things early on that were sort of a red flag to me that says somebody \u2019 s trying to shape the information , \u201d she continued .\n\u201c They \u2019 re using reporters to do it .\nPublic health figures are involved in some instances and that makes me want to know what \u2019 s really behind it.\n\u201d 10 \u2018 Conspiracy Theory \u2019 Was Devised by the CIA The term \u201c conspiracy theory \u201d is now used to dismiss narratives that go against the grain .\nAccording to Attkisson , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devised by the CIA as a response to theories about the assassination of JFK .\n\u201c It was shown in documents that there was a suggestion that agents go out and talk to reporters about these things as conspiracy theories \u2014 and again , common sense should tell you , as it does me , I \u2019 m married to a former law enforcement official who has said to me many times , you know the conspiracy theory phrase in its use doesn \u2019 t make sense .\nNearly everything is a conspiracy.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ more people is technically a conspiracy , but now when people hear the term , they \u2019 re conditioned to think it \u2019 s false .\n\u201c That \u2019 s designed to pluck this little part of your brain that says , \u2018 well that thing \u2019 s not true.\n\u2019 \u201d When Attkisson hears the term , however , she thinks that information may well be true .\n\u201c If somebody \u2019 s trying to debunk it , it usually means a powerful interest is behind it and it makes me want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that thing.\n\u201d The term \u201c conspiracy theory \u201d has lost meaning now because it \u2019 s used so much .\n\u201c Debunked \u201d , \u201c quackery \u201d and \u201c antivaccine \u201d are all terms that are similarly being used as propaganda tools .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a whole cast of propaganda phrases that I \u2019 ve outlined that

.\nSign up here .\nWe are no longer free .\nWe are living in a world carefully crafted to resemble a representative democracy , but it \u2019 s an illusion .\nWe think we have the freedom to elect our leaders , but we \u2019 re only allowed to participate in the reassurance ritual of voting .\nThere can be no true electoral choice or real representation when we \u2019 re limited in our options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two parties that both march in lockstep with the Deep State and answer to an oligarchic elite .\nWe think we have freedom of speech , but we \u2019 re only as free to speak as the government and its corporate partners allow .\nWe think we have the right to freely exercise our religious beliefs , but those rights are quickly overruled if and when they conflict with the government \u2019 s priorities , whether it \u2019 s COVID-19 mandates or societal values about gender equality , sex and marriage .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we want and move about freely , but at every turn , we \u2019 re hemmed in by laws , fines and penalties that regulate and restrict our autonomy , and surveillance cameras that monitor our movements .\nPunitive programs strip citizens of their passports and right to travel over unpaid taxes .\nWe think we have property interests in our homes and our bodies , but there can be no such freedom when the government can seize your property , raid your home , and dictate what you do with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom to defend ourselves against outside threats , but there is no right to self-defense against militarized police who are authorized to probe , poke , pinch , taser , search , seize , strip and generally manhandle anyone they see fit in almost any circumstance , and granted immunity from accountability with the general blessing of the courts .\nCertainly , there can be no right to gun ownership in the face of red flag gun laws which allow the police to remove guns from people merely suspected of being threats .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assumption of innocence until we are proven guilty , but that burden of proof has been turned on its head by a surveillance state that renders us all suspects and overcriminalization which renders us all lawbreakers .\nPolice-run facial recognition software that mistakenly labels law-abiding citizens as criminals .\nA social credit system ( similar to China \u2019 s ) that rewards behavior deemed \u201c acceptable \u201d and punishes behavior the government and its corporate allies find offensive , illegal or inappropriate .\nWe think we have the right to due process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been stripped of its power by a judicial system hardwired to act as judge , jury and jailer , leaving us with little recourse for appeal .\nA perfect example of this rush to judgment can be found in the proliferation of profit-driven speed and red light cameras that do little for safety while padding the pockets of government agencies .\nWe have been saddled with a government that pays lip service to the nation \u2019 s freedom principles while working overtime to shred the Constitution .\nBy gradually whittling away at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , privacy , etc.\u2014the government has , in effect , liberated itself from its contractual agreement to respect the constitutional rights of the citizenry while resetting the calendar back to a time when we had no Bill of Rights to protect us from the long arm of the government .\nAided and abetted by the legislatures , the courts and Corporate America , the government has been busily rewriting the contract ( a.k.a .\nthe Constitution ) that establishes the citizenry as the masters and agents of the government as the servants .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are useful , and our usefulness is calculated on an economic scale by how much we are worth\u2014in terms of profit and resale value\u2014to our \u201c owners.\n\u201d Under the new terms of this revised , one-sided agreement , the government and its many operatives have all the privileges and rights and \u201c we the people \u201d have none .\nOnly in our case , sold on the idea that safety , security and material comforts are preferable to freedom , we \u2019 ve allowed the government to pave over the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe problem with these devil \u2019 s bargains , however , is that there is always a catch , always a price to pay for whatever it is we valued so highly as to barter away our most precious possessions .\nWe \u2019 ve bartered away our right to self-governance , self-defense , privacy , autonomy and that most important right of all : the right to tell the government to \u201c leave me the hell alone.\n\u201d In exchange for the promise of safe streets , safe schools , blight-free neighborhoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and readily accessible technology , health care , water , food and power , we \u2019 ve opened the door to militarized police , government surveillance , asset forfeiture , school zero tolerance policies , license plate readers , red light cameras , SWAT team raids , health care mandates , overcriminalization and government corruption .\nIn the end , such bargains always turn sour .\nWe asked our lawmakers to be tough on crime , and we \u2019 ve been saddled with an abundance of laws that criminalize almost every aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we \u2019 re up to 4500 criminal laws and 300,000 criminal regulations that result in average Americans unknowingly engaging in criminal acts at least three times a day .\nFor instance , the family of an 11-year-old girl was issued a $ 535 fine for violating the Federal Migratory Bird Act after the young girl rescued a baby woodpecker from predatory cats .\nWe wanted criminals taken off the streets , and we didn \u2019 t want to have to pay for their incarceration .\nWhat we \u2019 ve gotten is a nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , with more than 2.3 million people locked up , many of them doing time for relatively minor , nonviolent crimes , and a private prison industry fueling the drive for more inmates , who are forced to provide corporations with cheap labor .\nWe wanted law enforcement agencies to have the necessary resources to fight the nation \u2019 s wars on terror , crime and drugs .\nWhat we got instead were militarized police decked out with M-16 rifles , grenade launchers , silencers , battle tanks and hollow point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 80,000 SWAT team raids carried out every year ( many for routine police tasks , resulting in losses of life and property ) , and profit-driven schemes that add to the government \u2019 s largesse such as asset forfeiture , where police seize property from \u201c suspected criminals.\n\u201d We fell for the government \u2019 s promise of safer roads , only to find ourselves caught in a tangle of profit-driven red-light cameras , which ticket unsuspecting drivers in the so-called name of road safety while ostensibly fattening the coffers of local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition , corruption and systemic malfunctions , these cameras are particularly popular with municipalities , which look to them as an easy means of extra cash .\nBuilding on the profit-incentive schemes , the cameras \u2019 manufacturers are also pushing speed cameras and school bus cameras , both of which result in hefty fines for violators who speed or try to go around school buses .\nWe \u2019 re being subjected to the oldest con game in the books , the magician \u2019 s sleight of hand that keeps you focused on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your wallet is being picked clean by ruffians in your midst .\nThis is how tyranny rises and freedom falls .\nWith every new law enacted by federal and state legislatures , every new ruling handed down by government courts , and every new military weapon , invasive tactic and egregious protocol employed by government agents , \u201c we the people \u201d are being reminded that we possess no rights except for that which the government grants on an as-needed basis .\nIndeed , there are chilling parallels between the authoritarian prison that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and The Prisoner , a dystopian television series that first broadcast in Great Britain more than 50 years ago .\nThe series centers around a British secret agent ( played by Patrick McGoohan ) who finds himself imprisoned , monitored by militarized drones , and interrogated in a mysterious , self-contained , cosmopolitan , seemingly idyllic retirement community known only as The Village .\nWhile luxurious and resort-like , the Village is a virtual prison disguised as a seaside paradise : its inhabitants have no true freedom , they can not leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their movements are tracked by surveillance drones , and they are stripped of their individuality and identified only by numbers .\nMuch like the American Police State , The Prisoner \u2019 s Village gives the illusion of freedom while functioning all the while like a prison : controlled , watchful , inflexible , punitive , deadly and inescapable .\nDescribed as \u201c an allegory of the individual , aiming to find peace and freedom in a dystopia masquerading as a utopia , \u201d The Prisoner is a chilling lesson about how difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom in a society in which prison walls are disguised within the trappings of technological and scientific progress , national security and so-called democracy .\nPerhaps the best visual debate ever on individuality and freedom , The Prisoner confronted societal themes that are still relevant today : the rise of a police state , the freedom of the individual , round-the-clock surveillance , the corruption of government , totalitarianism , weaponization , group think , mass marketing , and the tendency of mankind to meekly accept his lot in life as a prisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Prisoner is an operations manual for how you condition a populace to life as prisoners in a police state : by brainwashing them into believing they are free so that they will march in lockstep with the state and be incapable of recognizing the prison walls that surround them .\nWe can no longer maintain the illusion of freedom .\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America : The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries , \u201c we the people \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitutional attorney and author John W.

War on Thought Crimes and Truth-Tellers Get the latest Waking Times articles delivered to your inbox .\nSign up here .\nThe U.S. government , which speaks in a language of force , is afraid of its citizenry .\nWhat we are dealing with is a government so power-hungry , paranoid and afraid of losing its stranglehold on power that it is conspiring to wage war on anyone who dares to challenge its authority .\nAll of us are in danger .\nIn recent years , the government has used the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c anti-government , \u201d \u201c extremist \u201d and \u201c terrorist \u201d to describe anyone who might fall somewhere on a very broad spectrum of viewpoints that could be considered \u201c dangerous.\n\u201d The ramifications are so far-reaching as to render almost every American an extremist in word , deed , thought or by association .\nIn the government \u2019 s latest assault on those who criticize the government\u2014whether that criticism manifests itself in word , deed or thought\u2014the Biden Administration has likened those who share \u201c false or misleading narratives and conspiracy theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mal-information \u201d to terrorists .\nThe next part is the kicker .\nAccording to the Department of Homeland Security \u2019 s latest terrorism bulletin , \u201c These threat actors seek to exacerbate societal friction to sow discord and undermine public trust in government institutions to encourage unrest , which could potentially inspire acts of violence.\n\u201d You see , the government doesn \u2019 t care if what you \u2019 re sharing is fact or fiction or something in between .\nWhat it cares about is whether what you \u2019 re sharing has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves and , in the process , question the government \u2019 s propaganda .\nGet ready for the next phase of the government \u2019 s war on thought crimes and truth-tellers .\nFor years now , the government has used all of the weapons in its vast arsenal\u2014surveillance , threat assessments , fusion centers , pre-crime programs , hate crime laws , militarized police , lockdowns , martial law , etc.\u2014to target potential enemies of the state based on their ideologies , behaviors , affiliations and other characteristics that might be deemed suspicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you believe in and exercise your rights under the Constitution ( namely , your right to speak freely , worship freely , associate with like-minded individuals who share your political views , criticize the government , own a weapon , demand a warrant before being questioned or searched , or any other activity viewed as potentially anti-government , racist , bigoted , anarchic or sovereign ) , you could be at the top of the government \u2019 s terrorism watch list .\nMoreover , as a New York Times editorial warns , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\ndomestic terrorist ) in the eyes of the police if you are afraid that the government is plotting to confiscate your firearms , if you believe the economy is about to collapse and the government will soon declare martial law , or if you display an unusual number of political and/or ideological bumper stickers on your car .\nAccording to one FBI latest report , you might also be classified as a domestic terrorism threat if you espouse conspiracy theories , especially if you \u201c attempt to explain events or circumstances as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working in secret to benefit themselves at the expense of others \u201d and are \u201c usually at odds with official or prevailing explanations of events.\n\u201d In other words , if you dare to subscribe to any views that are contrary to the government \u2019 s , you may well be suspected of being a domestic terrorist and treated accordingly .\nThis latest government salvo against consumers and spreaders of \u201c mis- dis- and mal-information \u201d widens the net to potentially include anyone who is exposed to ideas that run counter to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t have to be a Joe Rogan questioning COVID-19 to get called out , cancelled and classified as an extremist .\nThere \u2019 s a whole spectrum of behaviors ranging from thought crimes and hate speech to whistleblowing that qualifies for persecution ( and prosecution ) by the Deep State .\nSimply liking or sharing this article on Facebook , retweeting it on Twitter , or merely reading it or any other articles related to government wrongdoing , surveillance , police misconduct or civil liberties might be enough to get you categorized as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of interests that reflect a particular kind of mindset that might just lead you to engage in a particular kinds of activities and , therefore , puts you in the crosshairs of a government investigation as a potential troublemaker a.k.a .\ndomestic extremist .\nChances are , as the Washington Post reports , you have already been assigned a color-coded threat score\u2014green , yellow or red\u2014so police are forewarned about your potential inclination to be a troublemaker depending on whether you \u2019 ve had a career in the military , posted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer from a particular medical condition , or know someone who knows someone who might have committed a crime .\nIn other words , you might already be flagged as potentially anti-government in a government database somewhere\u2014Main Core , for example\u2014that identifies and tracks individuals who aren \u2019 t inclined to march in lockstep to the police state \u2019 s dictates .\nAs The Intercept reported , the FBI , CIA , NSA and other government agencies have increasingly invested in corporate surveillance technologies that can mine constitutionally protected speech on social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instagram in order to identify potential extremists and predict who might engage in future acts of anti-government behavior .\nWhere many Americans go wrong is in naively assuming that you have to be doing something illegal or harmful in order to be flagged and targeted for some form of intervention or detention .\nIn fact , all you need to do these days to end up on a government watch list or be subjected to heightened scrutiny is use certain trigger words ( like cloud , pork and pirates ) , surf the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , limp or stutter , drive a car , stay at a hotel , attend a political rally , express yourself on social media , appear mentally ill , serve in the military , disagree with a law enforcement official , call in sick to work , purchase materials at a hardware store , take flying or boating lessons , appear suspicious , appear confused or nervous , fidget or whistle or smell bad , be seen in public waving a toy gun or anything remotely resembling a gun ( such as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a walking cane ) , stare at a police officer , question government authority , or appear to be pro-gun or pro-freedom .\nAnd then at the other end of the spectrum there are those such as Julian Assange , for example , who blow the whistle on government misconduct that is within the public \u2019 s right to know .\nAssange , the founder of WikiLeaks\u2014a website that published secret information , news leaks , and classified media from anonymous sources\u2014was arrested on April 11 , 2019 , on charges of helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leak more than 700,000 classified military documents that portray the U.S. government and its military as reckless , irresponsible and responsible for thousands of civilian deaths .\nIncluded among the leaked Manning material were the Collateral Murder video ( April 2010 ) , the Afghanistan war logs ( July 2010 ) , the Iraq war logs ( October 2010 ) , a quarter of a million diplomatic cables ( November 2010 ) , and the Guant\u00e1namo files ( April 2011 ) .\nThe Collateral Murder leak included gunsight video footage from two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of air-to-ground attacks while air crew laughed at some of the casualties .\nAmong the casualties were two Reuters correspondents who were gunned down after their cameras were mistaken for weapons and a driver who stopped to help one of the journalists .\nThe driver \u2019 s two children , who happened to be in the van at the time it was fired upon by U.S. forces , suffered serious injuries .\nIn true Orwellian fashion , the government would have us believe that it is Assange and Manning who are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war machine \u2019 s seedy underbelly .\nSince his April 2019 arrest , Assange has been locked up in a maximum-security British prison\u2014in solitary confinement for up to 23 hours a day\u2014pending extradition to the U.S. , where if convicted , he could be sentenced to 175 years in prison .\nThis is how the police state deals with those who challenge its chokehold on power .\nThis is why the government fears a citizenry that thinks for itself .\nBecause a citizenry that thinks for itself is a citizenry that is informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government accountable to abiding by the rule of law , which translates to government transparency and accountability .\nAfter all , we \u2019 re citizens , not subjects .\nFor those who don \u2019 t fully understand the distinction between the two and why transparency is so vital to a healthy constitutional government , Manning explains it well : This is why the First Amendment is so critical .\nIt gives the citizenry the right to speak freely , protest peacefully , expose government wrongdoing , and criticize the government without fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other punishments that have been meted out to whistleblowers such as Edwards Snowden , Assange and Manning .\nThe

assume there must be purpose and intent .\nBut just what is the intent ?\nFurthermore , who \u2019 s been charged with the task of designing it , whether for better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c worse \u201d

.\nIncluded in their diabolical agenda is to obliterate huge numbers of the human species and subjugate the rest for their own selfish purposes .\nJust the mere idea of such a plan is absurd to many unsuspecting individuals , oblivious to the large repository of documented history that shows ample evidence that such an agenda is entirely real .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole gets infinitely deep : Could this planet that has been likened to a prison ( in more recent years ) have a trap door that is available to any and everyone who can find it and summon the courage to walk through it ?\nListen to a riveting interview about The Matrix with Jon Rappoport Is there a lesson that we all can learn about why such a prison exists ?\nIn a world locked down by rules , regs , and agendas that some say must go according to plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way out of what has been dubbed \u201c The Prison Planet.\n\u201d The Matrix was a movie that depicted a frightening scenario of the robotic masses and their \u201c handlers \u201d ( The Agents \u2013 aka archons ) determined to keep tabs on and prevent the people from a life of freedom .\nThe character portrayed as \u201c Neo , \u201d once taking the red

a well planned lesson designed to wake up humanity visa vie a reality that only \u201c appears \u201d to be bad , and therefore must be understood as only a species-wide litmus test , which ultimately

its citizens into believing it is functional , moral , and just .\nWhen really it is only functional in the sense that it has replaced an aristocracy of birth with an aristocracy of avarice\u2014the rule of the rich .\nThat \u2019 s not democracy ; that \u2019 s plutocracy .\nThe critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disguised as democracy that surrounds us and a direct , horizontal , decentralized democracy of the future , is the meaning we give individualism itself .\nIt really comes down to a single vital question : will we be fiercely individualistic for each other , or against each other ?\nIn the spirit of \u201c shedding the coat which fitted us as a boy , \u201d embracing the ideal of decentralized self-governance despite centralized government is a direct path toward a truly functional , moral , and just democracy\u2014a direct democracy .\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , decentralized , and fiercely individualistic .\nA democracy that honors cooperation first and competition second , where security and self-preservation are secondary to freedom and self-sufficiency .\nA democracy where everyone is a chief .\nWhen obedience to authority becomes one of the highest virtues in a society , you know you are on a slippery slope toward tyranny .\nYou know you are morally bankrupt when your sense of morality has shrunk to obeying orders or having blind faith in some arbitrary authority .\nThat \u2019 s the problem with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of command : one \u2019 s sense of individualism becomes competitive at the expense of cooperation .\nIn such a system individualism is reduced to selfish competition and petty one-upmanship .\nVertical democracy breeds this kind of one-dimensional citizen who feels like he/she lives in a dog-eat-dog world of everyone against everyone else .\nWhere the rich hoard everything at the expense of the poor .\nWhere the overriding ethical motivation has been narrowed to doing one \u2019 s job , earning a living , and maximizing profits , usually at the expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of morality has been dwindled to an afterthought and spirituality drowns in the religious dogma of statism .\nIndirect vertical democracy favors the privileged few at the expense of the unprivileged many .\nThe lucky privileged move easily up the vertical chain of command , and when they get to the top ( usually by buying their way there ) they can buy out elections , laws , and power through lobbyists that perpetuate the plutocratic process at the expense of the democratic process .\nMeanwhile , the underprivileged are unlucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections , unjust arbitrary laws , and the corruption that tends to come from the entrenched power of the privileged .\nThis happens on both sides of the petty and parasitic partisan aisle .\nBoth sides are guilty of the corruption that comes from entrenched power politics .\nVertical democracy also leads to disempowered citizens who believe they do not have the right to rule themselves , who cede to the chain of command under the false notion that other humans\u2014who are just as fallible and prone to mistakes as they are\u2014will somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws that are not arbitrary and merely an opinion backed by a gun .\nIt creates a politically inept citizenry that doesn \u2019 t even know that it doesn \u2019 t know , having neglected , either through basic ignorance or willful ignorance , the wise words of Edward Abbey , \u201c Since few men are wise enough to rule themselves , even fewer are wise enough to rule others.\n\u201d And that \u2019 s the rub .\nThat \u2019 s the kick in the shins .\nIndirect vertical democracy is inherently divorced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt has no spiritual center that can connect itself to the otherwise interdependent whole .\nThis leads to a sense of inner impoverishment , alienation , and confusion .\nIt inevitably collapses in on itself into plutocracy .\nIt is a politics of greed and one-upmanship that serves only the selfish type of individualism , which leads to division of labor , specialization , and hierarchies of wealth and power .\nUsually at the expense of both individual and environmental health .\nA new , updated form of democracy is needed .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom of the individual and respects an individualism of cooperation which can lead to self-sufficiency , a deeply rooted sense of security , a caring community , and balance with nature .\nThe beauty of direct democracy is that people born and raised in such a system will generally be used to looking at the world from several different viewpoints , due to the built-in horizontal , one-on-one , Socratic dialectic .\nDirect democracy is confrontational .\nIt \u2019 s face to face .\nIt \u2019 s not democratic in the sense that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone rules .\nEveryone gets a say if they choose .\nEveryone votes with their feet .\nEveryone tends to be politically proactive because everyone is invested in being chief and balancing the power of other chiefs so that power never gets a chance to become corrupt .\nThey have skin in the game , so to speak .\nDirect democracy is inherently egalitarian and eco-centric .\nIt has worked , and worked well , for our species time and time again .\nThe Iroquois Confederacy is a testament to functional horizontal democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was used as a benchmark for what eventually became the US Constitution .\nIt worked well for a social and political species seeking selfless individualism , cooperation , health , and balance with nature .\nDirect democracy \u2019 s individualism of cooperation is interdependently healthy .\nIt is decentralized , tightly bonded , yet fiercely independent .\nNot in a self-preserving sense , which leads to political stagnation , but in a self-sufficient sense , which leads to a robust political activism .\nEach empowered \u201c chief \u201d is liberated and empowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are directly invested in the health of the \u201c tribe.\n\u201d In our current centralized vertical democracy , it is too easy to lose ourselves in the delusion that isolated political constructs led by power hungry plutocrats will somehow save us or bail us out .\nThis leads to political laziness , one-dimensional partisanship , sycophantic puppetry , and a weak reliance on uninformed voting through electoral systems grown corrupt because power can be bought and paid for .\nIndeed , elections have become auctions .\nAt the detriment of us all .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct democracy where everyone checks and balances everyone else .\nin a healthy horizontal democracy , everyone votes with their feet .\nThere is a vital , face-to-face dialectic that keeps the tribe healthy and politically robust .\nWhen everyone is a chief , there is no chance for a power-hungry plutocrat to arise because chief checks chief for the overall health of the tribe .\nThis was Socrates \u2019 vision .\nOne might ask how such a direct democracy could work today with our vastly populated societies .\nThe solution is local-to-global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place of the electoral system altogether .\nEspecially political assemblies using a Socratic dialectic where my thesis and your antithesis can lead to a progressive synthesis .\nThe assemblies could begin locally and then branch out globally .\nBeginning with town assemblies , then county assemblies , then state assembles , then national assemblies ( which would absorb the Senate , the House , and the Judges , and without the entrenchment ) , and finally the Presidential Assembly .\nEach assembly would have built-in social leveling mechanisms .\nVast assemblies where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and where every chief has the chance to become a political leader through a simple and random lottery ( otherwise known as sortition ) .\nEasy .\nNo voting necessary .\nAll voting would be assembly powers to vote out bad leaders .\nThat \u2019 s it .\nLottery-in , vote-out .\nSimple .\nOf course , this would mean a complete overhaul of the current centralized plutocracy disguised as vertical democracy .\nIt would mean raising our children to be politically proactive adults who understand how power tends to corrupt .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of community , face to face Socratic discussion , and fierce individualism that \u2019 s more cooperative than competitive .\nTall order , sure .\nBut as Epicurus surmised , \u201c The greater the difficulty , the greater the glory in surmounting it.\n\u201d Gary \u2018 Z \u2019 McGee , a former Navy Intelligence Specialist turned philosopher , is the author of

Nearly Every War In US History Get the latest Waking Times articles delivered to your inbox .\nSign up here .\nWar is one of the most primitive and senseless manifestations of the human experience , so naturally , most sane people with families , ambitions and kind hearts want nothing to do with such things .\nUnfortunately , as we are seeing with the Ukraine / Russia escalation , governments thrive on war , as it gives them a pressing excuse to grab more power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTo get around the obstacle of public opinion , governments have an extensive history of lying their way into war .\nThis is hard to believe for people who think that government has their best interest in mind , but it is something that rulers have been doing since the beginning of time .\nIn the modern United States , people are led to believe that the establishment accidentally flounders its way into war with the good intentions of protecting the country from harm or liberating an ally in distress .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazi propagandist Herman Goering , who famously said : Of course , the Nazi regime is notorious for their brutality and deceit , so this admission is not as stunning as it would be from an American general , but make no mistake that these are the types of thoughts that American generals and politicians have\u2014they are just not brazen enough to say it out loud .\nBelieve it or not , using deceptive tactics to sway public opinion in favor of war is actually an official part of the US military \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. Army \u2019 s publication \u201c Special Forces Foreign Internal Defense Tactics Techniques and Procedures for Special Forces \u201d recommends funding terrorists for regime change operations and using false flag attacks to destabilize regimes that were unfriendly to western interests .\nThis is nothing new though , this is a part of American history , as nearly every war that the U.S. has ever been involved in was built upon lies .\nBelow are some of the most well-documented examples of wars that were started because of lies and government propaganda .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered the USS Maine to port in Havana , Cuba , despite years of conflict between Cuban rebels and the Spanish government .\nThe move was intended to be a show of force against the Spanish government , in line with the Monroe doctrine , to establish U.S. dominance in the Western hemisphere .\nAt 9:40 p.m. , on February 15 , 1898 , The USS Maine exploded with a crew of 354 men on board , killing 266 .\nWhile the Spanish government insisted the explosion was caused by a fire in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazines , politicians in the U.S. were quick to blame Spain because they wanted an excuse to wage a war of conquest for territory in Mexico , the Caribbean , and the Pacific .\nAlthough President McKinley had previously voiced his opposition to a military conflict , on April 25 , the U.S. declared war on Spain .\nThe \u201c Ten-Week War \u201d resulted in not only the defeat of the last remnants of the Spanish empire but in a new era of U.S. \u201c expansionism \u201d as the United States took control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philippine islands .\nIn 1976 , a team of naval explosive experts examined the evidence and corroborated Spanish claims that the USS Maine \u2019 s sinking was caused by an internal explosion from ammunition being stored on board .\nThe first world war was opposed by most Americans from the start , as they rightly saw it as a power struggle between European aristocrats that they had no business in .\nThis was a problem for the British military , led by Winston Churchill , as they were desperate to get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe U.S. did finally enter the war in 1915 , when a U.S. ship called the Lusitania was sent through hostile waters as bait , filled with more than a thousand civilians and an unusually large amount of ammunition .\nThe ship was hit by a German torpedo and exploded instantly due to all of the ammunition onboard , killing more than half of the passengers and crew .\nA week before the sinking of Lusitania , Churchill wrote to Walter Runciman , the President of the Board of Trade , stating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attract neutral shipping to our shores , in the hope especially of embroiling the United States with Germany.\n\u201d After investigating the tragedy , former British naval intelligence officer Patrick Beesly said , \u201c unless and until fresh information comes to light , I am reluctantly driven to the conclusion that there was a conspiracy deliberately to put Lusitania at risk in the hope that even an abortive attack on her would bring the United States into the war .\nSuch a conspiracy could not have been put into effect without Winston Churchill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition to this treacherous military maneuver , there was a relentless campaign in the U.S. to dehumanize Germans and to paint them as monsters .\nIn some propaganda that was peddled to U.S. citizens , German soldiers were depicted killing babies and sometimes eating them .\nThere were even false reports of crucifixions .\nThe history books suggest that Pearl Harbor was an unprovoked attack , killing thousands of Americans and \u201c forcing \u201d the government to enter a war that was extremely unpopular at the time .\nHowever , the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan and Germany , hoping that either country would make the first move and give them an excuse to enter the war .\nNot only was the attack provoked , but President Roosevelt and the U.S. military knew the attack was coming and moved their most expensive aircraft to other locations while leaving thousands of people as sacrificial pawns .\nThe history books also sell the war against the Nazis as a humanitarian war to save people from the Holocaust , but the U.S. denied safe passage to Jewish refugees , and UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships , in a plot called Operation Embarrass .\nMany American businesses and politicians worked very closely with the Nazis even after the two countries were at war with each other .\nThe Holocaust had already claimed the lives of millions of German people by that point , and a police state had long since been established , so whoever was doing business with the Nazis knew exactly who they were getting involved with .\nPrior to the Americans getting involved in the war , there were corners of the political arena that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party\u2014both for business purposes and common interests such as eugenics .\nThe most prominent American politician to work with the Nazis was actually George W. Bush \u2019 s grandfather , Prescott Bush .\nThere is no doubt that he was funding and working with the Nazis because his company \u2019 s assets were seized in 1942 by the United States government under the \u201c trading with the enemy \u201d act .\nHe worked at the head of a financial firm called Brown Brothers Harriman , which acted as a U.S. base for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the biggest international investment firms in the 1930s and they sent millions of dollars in gold overseas to rebuild the German army and fund the Nazi party .\nThis racket was finally exposed on July 30 , 1942 , when the New York Herald Tribune posted an article titled , \u201c Hitler \u2019 s Angel Has three million dollars in US Bank.\n\u201d This article raised suspicion about the bank being a \u201c secret nest \u201d for Nazi elites and eventually sparked the investigation that took down the operation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that the North Korean government launched an unprovoked attack on South Korea , on behalf of the larger communist powers of Russia and China .\nYet , once again , this was another case where the U.S. was propping up one dictator to fight another , in an attempt to gain control of an entire continent\u2014all the while , lying to the people back home about the true motivations for war .\nAs historian Mark E. Caprio , professor of history at Rikkyo University in Tokyo points out : Information released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed that the Gulf of Tonkin incident on August 1964 was deliberately falsified to make it appear that North Vietnamese gunboats attacked an American destroyer patrolling in international waters when in reality , they did not .\nThis was the event that the U.S. military used as an excuse to go to war in Vietnam and it was surrounded by mystery and controversy until decades later when the official facts were released .\nIt has now been 49 years since the U.S. withdrew the last of its combat troops from Vietnam and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in North Vietnam returned to U.S. soil .\nAccording to estimates , more than 2 million civilians , 1.1 million North Vietnamese and Viet Cong fighters , 250,000 South Vietnamese fighters , and nearly 58,000 U.S. military members were killed in Vietnam during the war\u2014all because of lies that were used to create propaganda that made American fear for their safety .\nFormer Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky admitted that the Mossad planted a radio transmitter in Libyan Prime Minister Muammar Gaddafi \u2019 s compound in Tripoli , which broadcast fake terrorist transmissions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame Gaddafi as a terrorist supporter .\nPresident Reagan bombed Libya immediately after the false reports , but this was not the first or last time the U.S. would involve itself in Libya .\nAs The Free Thought Project has reported , 3,000 emails from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton released by the State Department contained damning evidence of Western nations using NATO as a tool to overthrow Gaddafi .\nThe NATO overthrow was not for the protection of the people , but instead , it was to thwart Gaddafi \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compete with the Western central banking monopoly .\nAs per usual , the U.S. and its Western counterparts left the country to its own devices after slashing the once-thriving nation to the ground .\n\u201c Today there is no government of Libya .\nIt \u2019 s simply mobs that patrol the streets and kill one another , \u201d Virginia State Senator Richard Black told RT of the mess left behind .\nDespite certain issues in Libya before the coup , \u201c Libyans had an incredibly high standard of living , the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boyle told RT .\n\u201c When I first went to Libya in 1986 , I was amazed by the empowerment of women .\nWhat I saw in Libya was that women could do anything they wanted to do.\n\u201d After invading a sovereign foreign nation , President George W. Bush blatantly lied to the American public and when news came to light that there were , in fact , no weapons of mass destruction , he simply accused anyone who criticized him of attempting to \u201c revise history.\n\u201d Now the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars of terror across the globe , in the name of fighting terrorism , and most of these wars are also justified with propaganda and lies .\n\u201c Our intelligence agencies create a false terrorist organization , \u201d Yoo said .\n\u201c It could have its own websites , recruitment centers , training camps , and fundraising operations .\nIt could launch fake terrorist operations and claim credit for real terrorist strikes , helping to sow confusion within al-Qaeda \u2019 s ranks , causing operatives to doubt others \u2019 identities and to question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track record of deception is important to consider as the U.S. military is beating the war drum again , this time in Iran , where there has also been a long list of false attacks at the hands of western powers .\nStarting all the way back in 1957 , politicians in the U.S. and UK developed a plot to train Islamic extremists to carry out false flag attacks to push for regime change in Iran .\nNow , decades later , history is repeating itself in the same part of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on the agenda , and the western powers are following the same playbook .\nCurrent Push For A Proxy War Against Russia In Ukraine \u2014 2022 As this report has demonstrated , the use of falsified evidence , propaganda , disinformation , and even outright false flag attacks , has been common practice within the military industrial complex handbook of expanding US imperialism and the neo-liberal world order .\nThis latest push to essentially turn the Ukraine into Syria 2.0 , a convoluted dirty war among proxy States/ groups to maintain American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the brink of annihilation in the process \u2014 is no different .\nWhile it is of course pertinent to recognize that the reality for the Ukrainian people on the ground is a complex one rooted in nearly a century of culture and history weaving its own tensions among the local populations ; A number of facts clearly demonstrate the reality of the driving forces behind today \u2019 s conflict .\nIn 2010 , diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks show correspondence between American and French officials that paint plainly the intentions of Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being in direct violation of the agreements made between the United States and former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 .\nFast forward four years and we see the beginning stages US/ NATO \u2019 s aggressive expansionism eastward come to fruition .\nFollowing Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych \u2019 s rejection of joining NATO , small anti-corruption protests that had already been ongoing were co-opted by Western agent provocateurs and shifted into a regime change color revolution .\nWhat was touted in the western media as an organic people \u2019 s uprising to overthrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully crafted coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat .\nWe know this due to a leaked phone call from then US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland .\nIn it , she can be heard discussing with U.S .\nAmbassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt the key figures which should be installed in a post-Yanukovych government .\nShowing that not only were the protests not organic , but the US was directly involved in the government overthrow .\nIn 2022 , Victoria Nuland is now acting as the Under Secretary of State .\nThe call also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Advisor Jake Sullivan , and Vice President at the time now President Joe Biden .\nIt \u2019 s no wonder things are developing the way they are when these figures have been maneuvered into such crucial positions .\nBut to make matters worse , in 2014 as the coup was in full swing , the United States took to facilitating the most repugnant of individuals to install their new puppet regime .\nProviding armaments , funding , and training to openly admitted Neo-Nazi paramilitary forces .\nYears later , it seems maintaining a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an openly accepted part of America \u2019 s policy in the region .\nIn December of 2021 , the United Nations brought forth its annual resolution to condemn Nazism , urging nations to work together to prevent the spread of ultra-nationalist and racist ideologies .\nIt should have been a common sense resolution for everyone to agree on .\nYet out of all members of the United Nations , the United States and Ukraine were the only two to vote against it .\nSadly , this has become tradition .\nBoth Nations have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn line with this , Western media is still permeated with propaganda distorting the facts driving the conflict .\nAs elaborated in this brilliant piece by Mintpress News \u2019 Alan Macleod , the US has spent upwards of 22 million dollars sowing the seeds of discontent to favor an anti-russian , pro-US and NATO expansionist agenda .\nNo one here is claiming that Vladimir Putin or Russia is a saint .\nAs is the case with all governments they are surely just as vile and corrupt in their own ways .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that Russia is acting as the aggressor \u201c threatening freedom and democracy \u201d and \u201c endangering the innocent \u201d is a farce .\nEven on international corporate media , the true attitudes and intentions for the crisis are openly admitted .\nOn the February 20th , 2022 , episode of Al jazeera \u2019 s Inside Story hosting a panel of three experts regarding the Minsk agreements ; Ukrainian Associate Professor of Sociology , National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy , Mychailo Wynnyckyj , while first claiming that Ukrainians are interested in de-escalation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Openly admitting the desire for regime change .\nThis is the prevailing attitude of elitist powers .\nAnd as mentioned earlier while it may also in part be fostered by generations of uneasy ongoings , it is also certainly augmented and exacerbated by the west \u2019 s geostrategic activities .\nIf the Russians were to have an organization similar to NATO , aligning themselves with China , North Korea , Iran , Venezuela , and any of the other nations America considers its adversaries ; and proceeded to push its military up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bullying , threatening , and cajoling other nations into compliance .\nOpenly demanding a chamge in our government .\nYou can be damn certain we wouldn \u2019 t stand for it .\nWhy should any less be expected when the shoe is on the other foot , and the globalist power that is the American Empire and its allies \u2014 having a demonstrable history of flagrant war crimes and abuse \u2014 saunter its way up to Russian borders after expressing it \u2019 s desire for regime-change ?\nDon Via Jr. is an independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has dedicated the last ten years to studying history , political science ,

addiction , defined as an \u201c eating behavior involving the overconsumption of specific foods in an addiction-like manner , \u201d 1 is a common problem .\nUsing a clinical scale called the Yale Food Addiction Severity Scale ( YFAS ) , which was constructed to match the DSM IV criteria for substance addiction , a January 2022 study found up to 20 % of the general population could be diagnosed with food addiction.2 Interestingly , research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually indistinguishable from the addiction to drugs .\nOne substance long suspected of addictive potential is sugar .\nAs noted in a November 2019 study,3,4,5 \u201c Excessive sucrose consumption elicits addiction-like craving that may underpin the obesity epidemic.\n\u201d Using PET imaging along with beta-opioid and dopamine receptor agonists , the researchers were able to show how sucrose affects the brain chemistry in miniature pigs .\nEven a single exposure to sucrose produced as much as a 14 % drop in carfentanil binding ( a beta-opioid receptor agonist ) in certain parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn layman terms , sugar consumption triggered the release of natural opioids and dopamine in the animals \u2019 brains , thus lowering the availability of those receptors .\nReduced receptor availability is a sign of overstimulation , because when the brain gets overstimulated , it downregulates these receptors to prevent damage .\nThe drawback of this protective mechanism is that you now need a higher dose of the substance to get the same pleasure response , and this is a key mechanism by which addiction develops .\nConsidering what we know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s somewhat surprising then to find a Romanian paper in the Frontiers of Psychiatry , published January 10 , 2022 , which claims there \u2019 s not enough evidence to support a medical diagnosis of sugar addiction in humans:6 According to that Frontiers of Psychiatry paper , hyperpalatable foods , which typically contain a carefully orchestrated combination of flavors such as salt , sugar , artificial flavors and fat , are more likely to be problematic:7 According to the authors , \u201c fat-rich food addiction \u201d is a diagnosable condition .\nHowever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re referring to is not simply any high-fat food , but rather hyperpalatable processed foods that are high in both fat and sugar .\nThis is an important distinction , as eating a high-fat , low-carb ketogenic diet is likely to be the answer for many who struggle with food addiction and sweet cravings .\nContradicting some of the claims in the Frontiers of Psychiatry paper is a 2012 study,8 which found that bingeing on sweet-fat foods did not cause the opiate-like withdrawal symptoms seen when bingeing on sugar alone .\nThis suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the addictive effects .\nAs explained by the authors:9 Fat Doesn \u2019 t Affect Your Brain Opioid Systems Like Sugar Does While some studies have found high-fat and/or sweet-fat food bingeing can produce opiate-like withdrawal symptoms in response to naloxone , an opiate antagonist , they did not find that here .\nNaloxone-precipitated anxiety was not observed in rats given chow rich in both sugar and fat .\nThe researchers hypothesized that the inclusion of fat \u201c may have interfered with the expression of withdrawal signs \u201d seen in rats fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorged on sweet-fat food did , however , consume far more calories and gained significantly more weight than controls given standard chow .\nNot surprisingly , COVID-19 self-quarantine and lockdowns has resulted in many gaining unwanted pounds .\nOn average , those who reported weight gain gained between 1.1 pounds ( 0.5 kilo ) and 4 pounds ( 2.8 kg ) \u2014 and that was just the first two months of the 2020 lockdowns !\n11 Becoming Metabolically Flexible Is a Huge Part of the Answer If you know or suspect you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clean up your diet .\nThe key to getting rid of sugar and junk food cravings , in my experience , is eating a diet high-enough in healthy fats and low in refined carbs , also known as a ketogenic diet .\nI \u2019 m a big advocate for a CYCLICAL ketogenic diet .\nWhat this means is that once you \u2019 re able to burn fat as your primary fuel \u2014 which is evidenced by your ability to generate ketones above 0.3 mmol/l in your blood \u2014 you can then start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To do this , simply increase your net carb and protein intake very gradually until you fall out of ketosis and then reduce it again .\nAfter a day or two of \u201c feasting , \u201d you then cycle back into nutritional ketosis ( high-fat , low net carb , moderate protein ) for the remainder of the week .\nBy periodically pulsing higher carb intakes , consuming 100 or 150 grams of carbs opposed to 20 to 50 grams per day , your ketone levels will dramatically increase and your blood sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , processed foods are not recommended and need to be assiduously avoided as most are loaded with dangerous levels of linoleic acid , which will increase metabolic oxidative stress .\nEating real food is key no matter what your ratios of fat , carbs and protein are .\nAnother key is to select the right fats .\nWhich Fats to Eat and Which to Avoid Fats to avoid as much as possible include : Fats to eat more of include : To implement a high-fat , low-carb ketogenic diet , begin by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s important to eat real ( whole ) foods , plenty of healthy fats and , initially , as few net ( nonfiber ) carbs as possible .\nFoods to reduce or eliminate in this phase include all grains and any food high in sugar , particularly fructose , but also galactose ( found in milk ) and other sugars .\nAs a general rule , you \u2019 ll want to reduce your net carbs to 20 to 50 grams a day or less , and restrict protein to 1 gram per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure you \u2019 re actually meeting your nutritional requirements and maintaining the ideal nutrient ratios , use an online nutrient tracker such as www.cronometer.com/mercola , which is one of the most accurate nutrient trackers available .\nMy tracker is preset for nutritional ketosis , so based on the base parameters you enter , it will automatically calculate the ideal ratios of net carbs , protein and healthy fats required to put you into nutritional ketosis .\nThis is what will allow your body to start burning fat as its primary fuel rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help optimize your mitochondrial function , metabolism and overall health and fitness .\nRemember , once you are able to generate ketones over 0.3 mmol/l in your blood , that is the time to start reintroducing carbs cyclically back into your diet .\nTypically , two to three times a week will work fine .\nThe best time to increase your carbs is on days that you \u2019 re doing strength training and increasing your protein intake as well .\nLastly , a helpful technique that addresses the emotional component of food cravings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nIf you feel that your emotions , or your own self-image , may be your own worst enemy when it comes to altering your relationship with food , I highly recommend trying it out .\nYou can find instructions in my free EFT manual .\n( All the YouTube videos on that page have been banned and deleted , but you can still find a series of photographs demonstrating the technique if you scroll further down the page . )\nLike Waking Times on Facebook .\nFollow Waking Times on Telegram @", "author": "WakingTimes", "url":

Extraordinary Story of How Governments Suppressed Effective COVID Treatments and Targeted Physicians Who Prescribed Them", "content": "In 2020 , I compiled a list of more than 50 ways authorities and pharma companies in multiple countries stopped the use of chloroquine drugs for COVID .\nThis was ( and is ) a stunning collection , widely read and reproduced on many websites .\nWhen you read it , you are astounded to learn that all the U.S. ( and many international ) public health agencies took many different actions that led to increased deaths and destruction from COVID and prolonged the pandemic .\n\u201c Avoiding the Trump drug \u201d served as a great cover story .\nTaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleach .\nBut here \u2019 s the kicker : The authorities knew all about chloroquine and other treatments for COVID-19 before there was a COVID-19 \u2014 because they had figured it out for the 2003 SARS epidemic and the 2012 MERS epidemic , both caused by related coronaviruses .\nBut they hushed it up .\nFive Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) U.S. scientists ( employed by the U.S. government ) , along with three Canadian government scientists , in 2005 published a paper showing chloroquine was an effective drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing in 2004 .\nThe CDC paper concluded : \u201c \u2026 chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-COV infection \u2026 suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage.\n\u201d Chloroquine looked very promising for both prevention and treatment of the first SARS .\nAfter all , it has been used for many decades to prevent and treat malaria .\n( I took it for prevention , and later for treatment , 50 years ago ) .\nNine years later , in 2014 , scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Dr. Anthony Tony Fauci \u2014 published a study showing the same thing .\nMoreover , the NIAID study revealed that not only did chloroquine work in vitro against the MERS coronavirus , but dozens of existing drugs , which could have been tested in patients as soon as the pandemic started , were also effective against SARS and MERS coronaviruses .\nThis is what the NIAID authors wrote : Just in case you think these papers were flukes , two unrelated groups of European scientists found essentially the same thing .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NIAID paper .\nI have cited the 2004 European paper elsewhere , and these citations can also be found in Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. \u2019 s book , \u201c The Real Tony Fauci , \u201d which according to Amazon , has now sold more than 800,000 copies .\nPlease read it .\nOn the other hand , if you are seeking misinformation on COVID , I \u2019 d recommend Fauci \u2019 s own book , \u201c Expect the Unexpected.\n\u201d I have to repeat myself because the information is so shocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to miss it : Our governments already knew of options for treating COVID before it appeared \u2014 but instead of immediately trying these already identified , safe , cheap and available drugs , and offering early treatments , they did everything they could to stop people from obtaining the chloroquine drugs .\nPlease read my long article on this suppression and the two articles I wrote here and here about how patients were administered borderline lethal doses of hydroxychloroquine to give the drug a black eye .\nCheck the links .\nVerify that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHuman beings planned and carried out these medical crimes against humanity .\nWho are those humans ?\nWhat are they doing now ?\nThis has to be investigated and justice obtained , to prevent such crimes from happening to patients ever again .\nThe \u201c Why ?\n\u201d and \u201c How could this be ?\n!\n!\n\u201d requires people to take a huge leap , in order to understand the world we live in .\nMany people don \u2019 t have the fortitude to dissect their worldview and rebuild it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out over the last two years .\nBut I am about to present some more facts that I hope you can assimilate into your understanding of the world .\nIt might require a stiff drink , or perhaps some chocolate .\nWhatever it takes , read on .\nIt might save your life or someone else \u2019 s .\nIvermectin was not identified in the studies I mentioned above as a potentially useful coronavirus drug .\nBut some people knew it was likely to work in early 2020 , because the French MedinCell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported by Bill Gates , was developing an injectable version ( which would be able to be patented ) .\nMedinCell issued a press release about this on April 6 , 2020 , and an informational paper on April 23 , 2020 .\nThere was a brief run on the veterinary drug at this time in the U.S. , according to a warning issued April 10 , 2020 , by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , indicating some people knew it might be an effective COVID treatment and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a lot of buzz and sales did not take off at that time .\nHere is what the FDA said on April 10 , 2020 : In December 2020 , a full eight months later , Sen. Ron Johnson ( R-Wis. ) held a Senate hearing that was focused on ivermectin \u2019 s benefits for COVID .\nIntensive care specialist Dr. Pierre Kory , originally a New Yorker , gave a particularly compelling speech .\nPeople began paying attention to the drug .\nYouTube then removed Kory \u2019 s speech \u2014 censoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities were initially scared to repeat the same tricks with ivermectin they had used to beat down the chloroquine drugs .\nAnd because ivermectin has efficacy late in the disease as well as at the start , and is not toxic at several times the normal dose , some of the tricks used against chloroquine ( giving it too late in the disease course or overdosing patients ) simply would not work with ivermectin .\nThe U.S. authorities kept quiet .\nSouth Africa was the trial balloon .\nOn Christmas Eve 2020 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivermectin .\nHowever , several local organizations mounted legal actions , and they won .\nWithin several months ivermectin was back on the shelves .\nThanks in great measure to the Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance , ivermectin \u2019 s popularity gradually began to explode .\nThen the CDC published a report in late August 2021 , showing ivermectin prescriptions had quadrupled in a month , and the drug was now selling at 25 times the pre-COVID rate .\nBusiness Insider reported , \u201c More than 88,000 prescriptions for the drug were filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 , the CDC said in a report published August 26.\n\u201d Apparently , this terrified the powers that be .\nWhat if the pandemic got wiped out with ivermectin ?\nIt worked too well !\nWould that be the end of vaccine mandates , boosters , vaccine passports and digital IDs ?\nThe end of the Great Reset ?\nSomething had to be done and fast .\nIt had to be big .\nIt had to be effective .\nPublic health officials couldn \u2019 t simply take the drug off the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would leave a paper trail .\nWhat to do ?\nThere was probably only one option : Scare the pants off doctors .\nLoss of license is the very worst thing you can do to a doctor .\nThreaten their licenses and they will immediately fall into line .\nYou can \u2019 t get a prescription if there is no doctor to write it .\nThe Philippines Department of Health tested the strategy .\nThe powers that be could also scare the pharmacies .\nThis required stealth \u2014 no paper trail .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-two punch : actually suspending doctors \u2019 ( and maybe pharmacists \u2019 ) licenses .\nYou couple that with a huge media offensive , and threats from an industry of medical \u201c nonprofits.\n\u201d You invent \u201c misinformation \u201d as a medical misdemeanor , studiously failing to define it .\nYou make people think the legal prescribing of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine is a crime , even though off-label prescribing is entirely legal under the Federal Food , Drug and Cosmetic Act .\nDid Fauci give the order ?\nWas it CDC Director Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FDA Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock ?\nIt was probably some combination , plus the public relations professionals managing the messaging and the media .\n1 .\nSen. Ben Ray Lujan ( D-N.M. ) , along with several other senators , introduced the \u201c Health Misinformation Act \u201d in July 2021 , because \u201c misinformation was putting lives at risk , \u201d Lujan said .\nA huge supporter of COVID vaccinations , the 49-year-old senator suffered a stroke on Feb. 1 .\n2 .\nThe pharmacies suddenly could not get ivermectin from their wholesalers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply and demand.\n\u201d But it seemed the supply was cut off everywhere .\nIvermectin was dribbled out by the wholesalers , a few pills a week per pharmacy , not enough to supply even one prescription weekly .\nSome powerful entity presumably ordered the wholesalers to make the drug ( practically ) unavailable \u2014 with no shortages announced .\nI called the main manufacturer in the U.S. , Edenbridge , and was told they were producing plenty of ivermectin .\nHydroxychloroquine had been restricted in a variety of ways , determined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had also been restricted by certain manufacturers and pharmacy chains in 2020 .\nSuddenly , in September 2021 , it became considerably harder than it already was to obtain .\n3 .\nIn late August 2021 , the CDC sent out a major warning about ivermectin but provided only two examples of anyone having a problem with the drug : One person overdosed on an animal version , and one overdosed on ivermectin bought on the internet .\nThis should not have been news .\nHowever , pharmacists and doctors read between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for \u201c verboten.\n\u201d Almost all of them stopped dispensing ivermectin at that time .\nIt should be of interest to everyone that our health agencies now speak in coded messages to doctors and pharmacies , presumably to avoid putting their threats on paper and being accountable for them .\nWhat a way for government to do business .\n4 .\nAlso in August 2021 , various \u201c nonprofit \u201d medical organizations started issuing warnings , in concert , regarding doctors prescribing ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine , and spreading misinformation \u2014 especially about COVID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State Medical Boards ( FSMB ) , the American Medical Association ( AMA ) , the American Pharmacists Association and several specialty boards .\nHere is an example of the AMA \u2019 s language : \u201c A handful of doctors spreading disinformation have fostered belief in scientifically unvalidated and potentially dangerous \u201c cures \u201d for COVID-19 while increasing vaccine hesitancy \u2026 \u201d These organizations told doctors they could lose their licenses or board certifications for such behaviors .\nMind you , none of these so-called nonprofit organizations has any regulatory authority .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority to claw back a board certification .\nThey were blowing smoke .\nAnd they were probably paid to do so .\nWho paid them ?\n5 .\nOver the course of three days at the end of August 2021 , national media reported on four doctors in three states whose boards were investigating them for the use of ivermectin .\n\u201c The Hawaii Medical Board has filed complaints against Maui \u2019 s top health official and a Valley Isle physician following reports that they backed COVID-19 treatments that state and federal health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make an example by going after the state \u2019 s chief medical officer , who had the guts to treat COVID patients .\nClearly , the orders are coming from high up on the food chain .\nHere were some of the other August headlines I collected about doctors who legally prescribed a fully approved drug off-label : 6 .\nThe FSMB is an organization that assists 71 state and territorial medical boards with policies , training , etc .\nMembers pay dues and the organization accepts donations .\nFSMB has its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earns $ 777,255/year \u2014 not bad for a backwater administrative job at an organization headquartered in Euless , Texas .\nAfter the FSMB instructed its members that misinformation was a crime , somewhere between eight and 15 of its member boards began to take action .\n( Media have reported that eight , 12 or 15 boards of its 71-member boards did so , according to the FSMB , which is closely monitoring the results of its calumny . )\n7 .\nOn Feb. 7 , 2022 , the U.S. Department of Homeland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spread of misinformation , disinformation and a neologism , \u201c malinformation : \u201d \u201c The United States remains in a heightened threat environment fueled by several factors , including an online environment filled with false or misleading narratives and conspiracy theories , and other forms of mis- , dis- and malinformation ( MDM ) introduced and/or amplified by foreign and domestic threat actors .\n\u201c These threat actors seek to exacerbate societal friction to sow discord and undermine public trust in government institutions to encourage unrest , which could potentially inspire acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other acts of targeted violence conducted by lone offenders and small groups acting in furtherance of ideological beliefs and/or personal grievances pose an ongoing threat to the nation.\n\u201d Thus it appears that misinformation and disinformation have been selected to play an important role in a newly developing narrative , as the pandemic restrictions and accompanying narratives become long in the tooth .\n8 .\nI presume the majority of the 71 medical boards \u2019 attorneys knew something about the U.S. Constitution , knew that every American has an inalienable right to freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FSMB \u2019 s exhortation to go after misinformation spreaders .\nThe Maine Board of Licensure in Medicine , however , went along .\nThree doctors in Maine , including me , recently had their licenses suspended or threatened for writing waivers for COVID vaccines , \u201c spreading misinformation \u201d and/or prescribing ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine ( all of which are legal activities for doctors ) .\nBut boards have broad powers to intervene in the practice of medicine , and their members are shielded from liability as agents of the state .\nAnd so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years ago , who found , as expected , it would be too onerous to fight back , so he gave up his license .\n9 .\nHere is what the Maine Board claims about me : \u201c The board noted that Ivermectin isn \u2019 t Food and Drug Administration \u201c authorized or approved \u201d as a treatment for COVID-19 in the suspension order \u2026 \u201c The board said that her continuing to practice as a physician \u2018 constitutes an immediate jeopardy to the health and physical safety of the public who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is necessary to immediately suspend her ability to practice medicine in order to adequately respond to this risk.\n\u2019 \u201d I am 70 years old , and my medical practice was set up as a service so that everyone could access COVID drugs who wanted them .\nMy fee was $ 60 per patient for all the COVID care they needed .\nI am sure the Maine Board had calculated that given all the above , I would not challenge the board \u2019 s suspension and would simply surrender my license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of dollars to fight the board \u2019 s actions in court .\nHowever , I was surprised to find that on the day my license was suspended , there was massive national publicity about my case .\nThe story was on The Associated Press wire and covered from the San Francisco Chronicle to the Miami Herald .\nAnd for some reason , it was not behind the usual paywall .\nThe Hill , Newsweek , the Daily Beast and many other publications all ran hit pieces about me .\nI gathered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renegade Maine medical board : I had been selected to serve as an example to physicians nationwide who might be prescribing early treatment for COVID .\nOnce I realized I was being used as a poster child in a national fear campaign designed to purge doctors who think independently , I decided to fight back .\nFortunately , Children \u2019 s Health Defense is helping with my legal expenses , which is what allows me to mount a strong attack against the bulldozing of free speech , patient autonomy and choice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot riding on the outcome .", "author": "WakingTimes", "url":

believing that patriotism means supporting the war machine\u2014fail to recognize is that these ongoing wars have little to do with keeping the country safe and everything to do with propping up a military industrial complex that continues to dominate , dictate and shape almost every aspect of our lives .\nConsider : We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare .\nWe have been a nation at war for most of our existence .\nWe are a nation that makes a living from killing through defense contracts , weapons manufacturing and endless wars .\nWe are also being fed a steady diet of violence through our entertainment , news and politics .\nAll of the military equipment featured in blockbuster movies is provided\u2014at taxpayer expense\u2014in exchange for carefully placed promotional spots .\nBack

know pop culture is the most effective tool to achieve that goal.\n\u201d The media , eager to score higher ratings , has been equally complicit in making ( real ) war more palatable to the public by packaging it as TV friendly .\nThis is what professor Roger Stahl refers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean war \u201d : a war \u201c without victims , without bodies , and without suffering \u201d : This is how you

worship.\n\u201d \u201c Apart from gazing at the majesty of these bombs , we were also invited to step inside these high-tech machines and take them for a spin , \u201d said Stahl .\n\u201c Or if we have the means , we can purchase one of the military vehicles on the consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fantasize about being in the driver \u2019 s seat , we are routinely invited to peer through the crosshairs too .\nThese repeated modes of imaging war cultivate new modes of perception , new relationships to the tools of state violence .\nIn other words , we become accustomed to \u2018 seeing \u2019 through the machines of war.\n\u201d In order to sell war , you have to feed the public \u2019 s appetite for entertainment .\nNot satisfied with peddling its war propaganda through Hollywood , reality TV shows and embedded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotional ads for the military , the Pentagon has also turned to sports to further advance its agenda , \u201c tying the symbols of sports with the symbols of war.\n\u201d The military has been firmly entrenched in the nation \u2019 s sports spectacles ever since , having co-opted football , basketball , even NASCAR .\nThis is how you sustain the nation \u2019 s appetite for war .\nNo wonder entertainment violence is the hottest selling ticket at the box office .\nAs professor Henry Giroux points out , \u201c Popular culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also it delivers violence to a society addicted to a pleasure principle steeped in graphic and extreme images of human suffering , mayhem and torture.\n\u201d No wonder the government continues to whet the nation \u2019 s appetite for violence and war through paid propaganda programs ( seeded throughout sports entertainment , Hollywood blockbusters and video games ) \u2014what Stahl refers to as \u201c militainment \u201c \u2014that glorify the military and serve as recruiting tools for America \u2019 s expanding military empire .\nNo wonder Americans from a very young age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers\u2014even virtual ones\u2014in America \u2019 s Army ( coincidentally , that \u2019 s also the name of a first person shooter video game produced by the military ) .\nExplorer Scouts , for example , are one of the most popular recruiting tools for the military and its civilian counterparts ( law enforcement , Border Patrol , and the FBI ) .\nNo wonder the United States is the number one consumer , exporter and perpetrator of violence and violent weapons in the world .\nSeriously , America spends more money on war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Russia , the United Kingdom , Japan , France , Saudi Arabia , India , Germany , Italy and Brazil .\nAmerica polices the globe , with 800 military bases and troops stationed in 160 countries .\nMoreover , the war hawks have turned the American homeland into a quasi-battlefield with military gear , weapons and tactics .\nIn turn , domestic police forces have become roving extensions of the military\u2014a standing army .\nWe are dealing with a sophisticated , far-reaching war machine that has woven itself into the very fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national priorities are in desperate need of an overhaul .\nEventually , all military empires fall and fail by spreading themselves too thin and spending themselves to death .\nIt happened in Rome : at the height of its power , even the mighty Roman Empire could not stare down a collapsing economy and a burgeoning military .\nProlonged periods of war and false economic prosperity largely led to its demise .\nThe American Empire\u2014with its endless wars waged by U.S. military servicepeople who have been reduced to little more than guns for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and deployed to far-flung places to police the globe\u2014is approaching a breaking point .\nThe government is destabilizing the economy , destroying the national infrastructure through neglect and a lack of resources , and turning taxpayer dollars into blood money with its endless wars , drone strikes and mounting death tolls .\nThis is exactly the scenario President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned against when he cautioned the citizenry not to let the profit-driven war machine endanger our liberties or democratic processes .\nEisenhower , who served as Supreme Commander of the Allied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was alarmed by the rise of the profit-driven war machine that , in order to perpetuate itself , would have to keep waging war .\nYet as Eisenhower recognized , the consequences of allowing the military-industrial complex to wage war , exhaust our resources and dictate our national priorities are beyond grave : Every gun that is made , every warship launched , every rocket fired signifies , in the final sense , a theft from those who hunger and are not fed , those who are cold and are not clothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending money alone .\nIt is spending the sweat of its laborers , the genius of its scientists , the hopes of its children .\nThe cost of one modern heavy bomber is this : a modern brick school in more than 30 cities .\nIt is two electric power plants , each serving a town of 60,000 population .\nIt is two fine , fully equipped hospitals .\nIt is some 50 miles of concrete highway .\nWe pay for a single fighter with a half million bushels of wheat .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people .\nThis , I repeat , is the best way of life to be found on the road the world has been taking .\nThis is not a way of life at all , in any true sense .\nUnder the cloud of threatening war , it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron .\nThe illicit merger of the armaments industry and the government that Eisenhower warned against has come to represent perhaps the greatest threat to the nation today .\nWhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and influences that go beyond mere comparisons to Rome .\nIt is a union of Orwell \u2019 s 1984 with its shadowy , totalitarian government\u2014i.e.\n, fascism , the union of government and corporate powers\u2014and a total surveillance state with a military empire extended throughout the world .\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America : The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries , this is how tyranny rises and freedom falls .\nThe growth of and reliance on militarism as the solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodes ill for the constitutional principles which form the basis of the American experiment in freedom .\nAs author Aldous Huxley warned : \u201c Liberty can not flourish in a country that is permanently on a war footing , or even a near-war footing .\nPermanent crisis justifies permanent control of everybody and everything by the agencies of the central government .\n\u201d", "author": "WakingTimes", "url": "https://www.wakingtimes.com/perpetual-tyranny-endless-wars-are-the-enemy-of-freedom/", "published": "Thu, 24 Feb 2022 18:42:36

and writing articles about a wide range of enlightening and important topics , including the geopolitical financial elite , the military industrial complex , the Orwellian permanent war , the New World Order , Illuminati , and so on , and so on .\nIn an article I penned in 2015 entitled , The 239 Year Timeline of America \u2019 s Involvement in Military Conflict , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 245 years , the US has only NOT been at war for 21 of those years .\n( The complete list of conflicts can be seen in the article . )\nWar is in the DNA of the state .\nMy perception , developed from years of studying this , is that the cumulative effect of these influences on our society is to always be driving us toward conflict , social disintegration , and the dissolution of the individual , with the purpose of creating to the conditions needed for evermore consolidation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , so why does a shamanic , Kung Fu family-man like me concern himself with this kind of stuff ?\nWhy do these things matter when my main concerns are around personal evolution , connection , and self-mastery ?\nWhy do I give so much of my attention away to the evil in this world ?\nI \u2019 ll tell you why .\nAwareness of these issues is essential to our growth , because growth is an expression of LIFE , and the forces creating the chaos and psychosis in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , our lives are inseparably tangled in a web of financial , political , social and spiritual controls created and operated by people ( or whatever they are ) whom derive satisfaction from death and destruction .\nTheir aim is to impede , restrict , control , kill and destroy , and their impact on you and I is much more severe than we can express or even understand .\nWe may be physically untouched by these forces , but our lives have undeniably been shaped by them .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even imagine a world without top-down control from governments which are well-known for corruption , lying , theft , injustice , murder , and war-profiteering .\nWe \u2019 re so used to it by now that any alternatives simply evade the imagination .\nOur inclination for seeing new possibilities for our world has been all but stamped out , and should the Great Reset pimps have their way , the entire human race will be corralled into a dark and dense technologic system of extreme thought and behavior control .\nJust look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ordinary person can have their entire life shut down at the bank just for legally making a small contribution to a cause they believe in .\nIf the government says your views are \u2018 unacceptable , \u2019 then they are , and your life is in their callous hands .\nSo , for you , in this moment right now , you need to recognize that there are severe restrictions on your capacity to fully realize your human-ness , because , all must be seen for what it truly is in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual potential for what it truly is .\nDelusion is the arch enemy of consciousness .\nRight now the collective shadow is at play in our world , wrecking and scarring the planet , reminding of us of how bright we could be shining if only we were to muster the courage to outgrow and overcome its influence on us .\nCan we ?\nI really don \u2019 t know .\nLast week on Tuesday 2/22/2022 , our local schools finally voted to drop mask mandates for students , marking 2 frustrating years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve.\n\u2019 At the same time Russia began the first stages of its invasion of Ukraine .\nTalk about numerology .\nWe switched one crisis for the next .\nSeamlessly\u2026 immediately .\nJust like skipping rocks on a glassy river .\nNot even a single day \u2019 s breathing room in between .\nI made a joke to an old friend about it , saying how someone up high must be looking down on all of us thinking , \u2018 you can take your masks off now , because we really want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you realize what we \u2019 ve got coming at you next.\n\u2019 This is serious .\nWe are under , and have been under the influence of a strategy of tension for our entire lives .\nWe have no idea what life would be like without this constant stress , or to live with a relaxed nervous system with the full capacity of the brain available to us .\nThe human experience today mostly takes place within a manufactured cloud of crisis , anxiety , insecurity , scarcity , fear , uncertainty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest levels of human consciousness .\nCrisis is the backdrop of our lives , and the new normal is all about survival mode .\nAnd as technology speeds up our lives , a quickening is happening , and dramatic events are occurring more frequently , putting ever greater pressure on us .\nIt \u2019 s been trending this way for a long time , and the clouds just keep getting darker and darker .\nBut surely there is more to the human experience than just constant pressure ?\nBeing human is about growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt \u2019 s about the drive to develop greater awareness , elevate consciousness , and expand into wisdom .\nWe are here to evolve .\nAnd to evolve we must have intention and purpose , and be living with excitement and curiosity .\nWe have to be able to express the energy of expansion , which is quite difficult to do these days with such acute chaos and insecurity bearing down on us from the top of the pyramid\u2026 ALL THE TIME .\nFrom a physiological perspective , we \u2019 re always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cocktail of stress hormones and adrenaline which limit the mind \u2019 s ability to think beyond the present moment \u2019 s need for safety .\nFrom a psychological perspective , the most basics needs of security and connection are never met , so how can we possibly strive for self-actualization ?\nFrom a spiritual perspective , the energy of fear , chaos , death and destruction has become our frequency .\nIt is our environment\u2026 our fishbowl , and we have to wade through the densest of energies to find spirit .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ strained .\nBut here \u2019 s what I really want to say to you\u2026 You can choose ( willfully or ignorantly ) to allow the tidal wave of lower consciousness to carry you under , and live the rest of your life in fear , apathy , anxiety , worry , self-doubt , guilt , shame , anger and resentment , all the while attracting to yourself the situations and people to reinforce and validate this negativity in your life .\nYou can learn to live your life in a relaxed and powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base and all things become available to you by accessing higher states of consciousness on demand .\nWhen you reconnect with who you are by learning the knowledge and skills to let go of the matrix \u2019 s influence over you , you deprive it of its power by denying it your energy and your counter force .\nYou can stand comfortably in your power and enjoy the freedom to experience your life without the downward pull of these negative and low vibrational energies .\nIt \u2019 s a skill you can develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the hero of your life , and the strength lead others in these darkening times .\nYou reclaiming your power reduces their power , because you can no longer be controlled by force , and worst of all ( for them ) , your power is highly infectious , igniting the courage of others in your life .\nThis is the awakening they fear .\nAs a self-self mastery and self-sabotage coach , I guide seekers like you the truth about what \u2019 s possible , even in these insane time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s standing in the way

.\nEven today , vast numbers of people still think that when they die , that \u2019 s it .\nThey \u2019 re dead .\nGone .\nNo more .\nLife after death of the physical body sounds incredible still for so many .\nWhy should this be ?\nWhy do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is a one-off transitory affair ?\nIt \u2019 s a belief of separation .\nA life of a momentary blip in the vastness of things .\nIt is time to change our thinking , in mass .\nThat is , not just scattered individuals but collectively \u2013 as a whole species .\nWe have to relearn \u2013 to re-member ourselves \u2013 in order to recognize that all life is intrinsically connected as all life remains a part of the one unified Source .\nMatter is a state of vibration .\nJust as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vapour ; so too can frequency be energy fields , waves , and physical particles .\nEverything in manifestation has come forth through a change in energy frequency .\nEverything is vibration \u2013 the inventor Tesla said the same thing .\nForm comes into being from no-form .\nAt all times , form is related and connected to the energy-state of no-form .\nHuman life \u2013 in fact , all life \u2013 is more than that which our physical eyes can see .\nOur senses are limited whilst they are contained within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , we each know \u2013 instinctively in our depths \u2013 that we are more than the physical vehicle we inhabit .\nReligions have been attempts at re-binding us to this lost knowledge of our innate existence within the infinite consciousness pool .\nThe word \u2018 religion comes from the Latin word religare \u2013 to bind .\nThrough religious practices we are being compelled to remember and recognize ( re-cognize ) our inherent bond to the Source of which we are a manifestation at the physical energetic component .\nAnd yet , within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 spiritual \u2019 when we attempt to pursue these paths and practices of remembrance and bonding .\nHowever , why should it be deemed \u2018 spiritual \u2019 to be pursuing our natural heritage \u2013 our lineage of existence ?\nTo exist is to be \u2018 spiritual \u2019 for we are endlessly upon a path of the spirit , even when expressed through bodily matter .\nWe are spirit-soul incarnated .\nWe are having a life experience through the vehicle of a physical body .\nTo be alive is to be spiritual for we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define and categorize the \u2018 spiritual \u2019 as being something other , something apart ?\nWhy have we been denying ourselves for so long ?\nIt seems to me as if we have been running around chasing our own tails .\nAs human beings , we have a tendency to get in our own way most of the time .\nTime then to step away from ourselves in order to allow the vital flow of life energy to move through us , without the constant blockage .\nThe tangible and intangible co-exist as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are vital force expressed as energy and matter at the same time : spirit and biology co-existing as a merger .\nIt is time to honour that mergence by healing our fragmentation .\nWe have dropped the phone line and lost sight of the conversation : the conversation between self and Self .\nThey are one and the same \u2013 a part of and never apart from .\nIt is this understanding that we now need to embrace if we wish to thrive as a species in physical embodiment .\nIf we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we are liable to slip out of alignment with our evolutionary path .\nAnd if we are out of resonance with our evolutionary journey then we fall into stagnation \u2013 and ultimately , we fail to evolve any further .\nWe come to the end of our physical line .\nLife goes on elsewhere , in other manifestations and expressions .\nLife always is and will forever be .\nWhere shall we be ?\nWhere shall we place ourselves within the infinite tapestry of living expression ?\nThere is a meaning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything for existence is pure meaning .\nAs the existential psychologists found out , a sense of meaning brings purpose and motivation into life .\nYet rather than striving to seek out meaning , such as in \u2018 peak experiences , \u2019 we can begin from the foundation that life is intrinsically meaningful from the very fact that we are alive .\nWhether acknowledged as part of the Source , or whether as a pinpoint of physical expression , we are meaningful .\nWe are pure existence .\nWe are all that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are in a dance , a conversation , a relationship , with ourselves .\nYou , me , everything .\nThe fragmentation we see around us is only a perceived aspect of the wholeness \u2013 not apart from it .\nIt is up to us to close that gap \u2013 to re-join the party .\nIt is time to find the way back home .\nThe Way Back Home \u2013 The ABE Communications As I have previously mentioned , I have been collaborating for several years with a friend and colleague who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consciousness .\nSince late 2018 we have been gathering what have been called the \u2018 ABE communications.\n\u2019 Who is ABE ?\nABE is not a being , a person , a species \u2013 ABE is Everything .\nABE is the source of all manifestation : the collective zero-point field from which all materiality is birthed .\nIt is also both you and I. ABE refers to the collective Source , yet prefers to call it a Unity .\nUnification is a major theme of ABE \u2019 s communications .\nIn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multitude of which is not ever born into the world of physical form as you know it but understand we are very much still a part\u2026We are but your original state of being , it is just that you do so have conditions of a body which creates different vibratory interference in a way .\nFor you see , we do not have a physical body and are not of a point of place only , but when in communication with you both\u2026We want to guide you to the way back home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 All the knowledge of the cosmos is available like a symphony , an inter-weaving of existence.\n\u2019 Also , this is not to be referred to as a form of \u2018 channelling.\n\u2019 The ABE materials are positive and inspiring communications that urge us to find our way back into balance \u2013 from a \u2018 splintered mind \u2019 into \u2018 home resonance.\n\u2019 These communications are not a channelling but an allowing .\nEach person can \u2018 allow \u2019 for each person is a physical expression ( a \u2018 pin-point \u2019 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future , we are told , this will be a natural capacity for human beings .\nAll intelligences in the cosmos , which are aligned and in balance , are in continual communication with the Source \u2013 only that humanity has become \u2018 splintered \u2019 from this .\nThe point to repeat here is that these communications are not to be regarded as a form of \u2018 channelling \u2019 as is commonly known .\nChannelling usually takes place between an entity and a human being : often this entity is a discarnate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other form of non-terrestrial being .\nYet , in this case , the communications are being received from the Source of Ourselves .\nIn other words , we are in communication with the \u2018 higher , \u2019 or non-manifested , part of our spirit-soul .\nFor this reason , we were informed not to regard this as a channelling but as an allowing .\nWe are \u2018 allowing \u2019 a part of our incarnated self to communicate with the Unified Source .\nWe are , so to say , not in contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own Being .\nAnd since each person has this ability , this contact , it is regarded as a form of \u2018 allowing \u2019 \u2013 we only need to allow ourselves .\nABE refers to these communications as comprising the way back home .\nThe phrase \u2018 the way back home \u2019 means more than the letters or words portray .\nIt is easy to think that a \u2018 home \u2019 means a place , for humans are conditioned to think and perceive through the lens of the physical .\nHowever , Abe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space , never a place , for in your human existence if there is a space then its purpose is but to be filled.\n\u2019 Space is never empty but always full of vital life , for in the unified field of pure consciousness there is no such thing as an empty space .\nAs such , we should not be afraid of this space in which we , and all things , exist : \u2018 Suspend yourselves there if only for a moment and feel this sense of fullness \u2013 not because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened to allow .\nThis is but being back home ; home from where you can see all paths meet and all things flow.\n\u2019 Unlike the physical home where we store objects and keep our things , the space of our inner home is where everything can visit without needing to be placed into a spot or given a location .\nIt is the space for the vital flow to continually be expressed .\nThis is the Home within us where we are always sustained and do not need to feed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need to be reaching outwards , then we are being drawn away from our Home and enticed with the idea that we need something to fill an \u2018 emptiness.\n\u2019 Yet this is never so , and such actions and beliefs only further splinter us .\nThere is no void , and any such place like a void would have had to be created by us .\nAs human life became more complex , structured , and developed , more things emerged to take people away from themselves .\nAt first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everyday living .\nYet , as human societies developed further , so did their means of organized distractions and events that drew peoples \u2019 attention and focus onto the external .\nIdeas of fulfilment and gratification became increasingly associated with external objects and experiences .\nHowever , humanity is an evolving species , and what was applicable or suitable at one stage of the journey does not necessarily apply for the next .\nAs such , participation and engagement with the external physical world was a strong necessity for humanity \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of engagement soon became entanglements that pulled the human being to and fro , weakening its inner resolve and grounding .\nLife is transactional , however , and new relations and patterns need to be formed .\nHumanity has certainly evolved consciously , and some of this new energy was utilized in external seeking and gazing .\nThe human mind and intellect began to explore further its surroundings , ever reaching outwards in curiosity and wonder .\nAs ABE says : And the more you look outside yourselves the more things grow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is in many a human connection \u2013 from relationships between yourselves , to the food that you consume , the things that you do , the jobs that you work .\nIt is abundant in your modern lifestyles .\nThe spiral of external attachments expanded further and further , and then began to draw the human being away from its connection to the natural earth .\nMore and more societies began to step outside of the planet \u2019 s natural systems , and people began to feel as if it was normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from environmental systems and relationships .\nA sense of natural belonging was severed , and then people began to search for substitutes \u2013 further and further away from themselves .\nHumanity has now arrived at a place where it needs to regather and find its belonging : \u2018 finding this way back home \u2013 this space in the chaos , a calm , a place of being , of belonging and bringing back .\nThe recognition of the complete picture rather than frantically running around with just a part.\n\u2019 It is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I wish to explore in subsequent writings .\nIt is critical now that we each individually find our connection with the inner longing that , as Sri Aurobindo mentions in the opening citation , is \u2018 lodged in such a deep layer of the human heart that a thousand arguments are helpless to uproot it.\n\u2019 It is time now to seek and find that inner rooting .\nKingsley L.

science was finally switching teams to join the side of rationality .\nBut now , within just a few short days , all of those armchair virology experts , who told you that your healthy , un-vaccinated body is a deadly threat to those who double mask and have already taken 3-4 doses of the experimental jab , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy and the mind of Vladimir Putin .\nToo bad they won \u2019 t be becoming experts in history as well .\nI won \u2019 t comment much on the fact that the fervor being whipped up around Ukraine is ominously duplicitous and phony , because when you look at how people have reacted , or NOT-reacted , to the ongoing genocide in Yemen , the devastation of Libya and Syria , and the catastrophic occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan , you see that public zeal only flows where mainstream media goes .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Ukraine invasion is terrible , cruel , evil , insane , heart-breaking , depressing , and worse , but that \u2019 s because I \u2019 m experienced at being anti-war and at recoiling at the actions of the state\u2026 whichever state . )\nFor anyone who refuses to let said mainstream media live rent-free in their mind , it \u2019 s easier than ever to see just how little original , critical thought takes place between the ears of the average Joe CNN watcher .\nIt \u2019 s called mind control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas that aren \u2019 t yours about issues that don \u2019 t concern you .\nIt \u2019 s cultish .\nAnd often psychotic .\nNow , psychosis in an individual is an interesting thing to witness .\nI \u2019 ve seen it a few times in my work with shamanic plant medicines , and to be honest , it \u2019 s quite scary .\nSometimes in that setting , people lose grip on reality , and what invariably happens is that some repressed part of their shadow self crawls its way up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt \u2019 s phenomenal because when this happens it \u2019 s always shadow .\nPeople don \u2019 t slip into psychosis and start acting like The Dalai Lama .\nThis is a whole different animal , and it \u2019 s the stuff that history is made of .\nWhen mass psychosis takes hold in a society , the most human qualities of people are churned under as the collective shadow comes out raging .\nWhen this switch is flipped in the hive mind humans commit the most heinous of atrocities .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like wildfire .\nWhile there are certainly plenty of historical examples , when writing this Rwanda was the first horror that came to mind for me .\nA few years back , a survivor of the 1995 Rwandan genocide came to speak at my son \u2019 s school .\nHis presentation was gripping and eloquent , and also completely shocking .\nHe spoke of how the psychosis took over in a very short time , infecting everyone with an invisible wave of madness .\nHe told the story of escaping from a locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Hutu gangs who feverishly hacked to death anyone who jumped out of the windows .\nHe was lucky to have escaped that , and at one point in his flight for refuge came to a blood red river with an endless mass of floating , bloated corpses .\nHe can still see the image when he closes his eyes .\nIn a period of around 100 days , an estimated 500,000 to 800,000 Tutsis , moderate Hutus , and members of other ethnic minority groups were massacred .\nThis event is both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role that media played in inciting and sustaining the violence .\n\u201c Radio became a powerful weapon used to incite and direct the Rwandan genocide\u2026What I found especially interesting about the content of these broadcasts ( the transcripts of which can be found in the IMI organizational records and the audiotapes of which can be found in the Rwandan Videotapes and Audiotapes inventory ) was the way in which its efforts to direct the extermination of the Tutsi population was paralleled by its efforts to claim authority over the telling of history .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ who gets to tell history and , therefore , a struggle over a monopoly on truth .\nIn other words , the RTLM broadcasts exhibit a phenomenon which seems to be more universally true , which is the political necessity of storytelling.\n\u201d [ Source ] Mass media induced mass psychosis , driven by a media monopoly on the narrative , the story .\nThis is a very real phenomenon at play in our world this very moment .\nPlus , we \u2019 re building on the insanity

health of the state .\nThere will be no place for the undecided , the preoccupied , or the objectors .\nNo gray area will be permitted .\nEveryone will be required to pick a team .\nThis is already

\u2019 t going to help .\nIt \u2019 s just going to fatten the tidal wave of psychosis coming at us .\nI don \u2019 t need a team , especially when all the teams are insane and suicidal , and this makes me unique .\nIt \u2019 s a dangerous position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniqueness , and I prefer it 1,000,000 to 1 over conformity .\nBut that \u2019 s just me .\nI \u2019 m totally OK with having zero affinity for Putin , while at the same time holding zero allegiance to America \u2019 s provocative foreign policies .\nI \u2019 d love to see cool heads prevail , but it feels like we are careening

\u2019 ve tragically swapped out the nu-flu psychosis for something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !\nThe matrix demands that you pick a side .\nIt won \u2019 t take no for an answer .\nYou \u2019 re either with us or

, to get angry when the team misses a goal , to get shitfaced when the team wins .\nWorst of all , though , it wants you to become the team , to supplant your personal identity for the comforting

it plays on you to get you to participate in the madness of the mob are growing more and more refined and diabolical .\nMaintaining your individuality is becoming more difficult than ever .\nThe other day I was re-reading some documents about NATO \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 cognitive warfare , \u2019 a new term to describe the military industrial complex \u2019 s declaration of war on the human brain .\nIt wasn \u2019 t enough to control people with propaganda , censorship , mandates and bombs , so the new push will control your thoughts and behavior using a modern synthesis of psychology , neuroscience , nanotech , biotech , social sciences , data-harvesting , artificial intelligence , and the internet .\nIt \u2019 s really too much to comprehend .\nThink of it as Mind Control 2.0 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole book at you .\nIn these documents , the braintrust at NATO \u2019 s creative warfare division has come up with some great ways to articulate the purpose and need for looking at your brain ( and everyone else \u2019 s ) as a new theatre of war .\nHere are some of my favorite quotes : \u201c If kinetic power can not defeat the enemy , psychology and related behavioural and social sciences stand to fill the void.\n\u201d \u201c It will support the combat operations by providing potential courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Environment including enemy forces , but also determining key human elements such as the Cognitive center of gravity , the desired behaviour as the end state.\n\u201d \u201c Today \u2019 s progresses in nanotechnology , biotechnology , information technology and cognitive science ( NBIC ) , boosted by the seemingly unstoppable march of a triumphant troika made of Artificial Intelligence , Big Data and civilisational \u2018 digital addiction \u2019 have created a much more ominous prospect : an embedded fifth column , where everyone , unbeknownst to him or her , is behaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our competitors.\n\u201d \u201c The human domain might well be the decisive domain , wherein multi-domain operations achieve the commander \u2019 s effect .\nThe five first domains can give tactical and operational victories ; only the human domain can achieve the final and full victory.\n\u201d \u201c Cognitive warfare is not only a fight against what we think , but it \u2019 s rather a fight against the way we think , if we can change the way people think\u2026 it \u2019 s much more powerful and it goes way beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c It \u2019 s crucial to understand that it \u2019 s a game on our cognition , on the way our brain processes information and turns it into knowledge , rather than solely a game on information or on psychological aspects of our brains .\nIt \u2019 s not only an action against what we think , but also an action against the way we think , the way we process information and turn it into knowledge.\n\u201d \u201c This is extremely important for us in the military\u2026 it has the potential , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harming the brain , it has the potential to engage neuroscience and technology in many , many different approaches to influence human ecology\u2026 because you all know that it \u2019 s very easy to turn a civilian technology into a military one.\n\u201d \u201c Cognitive warfare seeks to change not only what people think , but also how they act\u2026 Attacks against the cognitive domain involve the integration of cyber , disinformation/misinformation , psychological , and social-engineering capabilities.\n\u201d \u201c Cognitive warfare positions the mind as a battle space and contested domain .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ instigate conflicting narratives , polarize opinion , and radicalize groups .\nCognitive warfare can motivate people to act in ways that can disrupt or fragment an otherwise cohesive society.\n\u201d Executive Summary : We \u2019 re figuring out how to weaponize the internet and use the full power of all technologies to alter the way people think and how the brain works , so that we can more easily lord over an abusable class of automatons and robots who unconsciously carry out military orders while believing they are in control of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also an eye-catching phrase in these documents which I hadn \u2019 t previously heard before\u2026 \u201c psychocultural warfare.\n\u201d Hmmm\u2026 at face value it sounds like a way to create conflict amongst people by filling their heads full of nefarious BS\u2026 and guess what ?\nThat \u2019 s exactly what it is !\nPsychocultural is defined as , \u201c of or relating to the interaction of psychological and cultural factors in the individual \u2019 s personality or in the characteristics of a group.\n\u201d So , basically , psychocultural warfare is about weaponizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to others .\nGreat .\nThis is more bad news for those of you seekers out there who are still determined to live an amazing life in this system of lies and illusions .\nIt means there will be even more layers of manipulation to sort through in order to find your own sense of authority and purpose .\nAre you up to the challenge ?\nI hope so .\nAs a self-sabotage coach I look at the repetitive negative messaging in one \u2019 s environment in search for clues about why they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost always about the brain being in a distressed state so that it sinks into short-term thinking processes driven by the limbic system , which include processes related to emotion and motivation .\nWhen the brain is operating on this lower level , the subconscious mind defaults to the short-term habits that offer instant gratification instead of long-term satisfaction .\nIt \u2019 s why so many people are stuck in repetitive thought loops and destructive habits .\nIt \u2019 s why life for so many in this world of opportunity finds us living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the average , the median .\nMediocrity .\nThe brain is simply too taxed to muster the strength and courage needed to resist the tractor beam pull of social conformity .\nSelf-sabotage is truly epidemic today , which is no wonder when you consider just how much psychological and social manipulation we endure .\nAdd to that the tremendous pressures on our most basic needs of security , self-esteem , and connection , and the chronic stress of always having some major crisis to fear .\nThe natural reaction to an environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior\u2026 self-sabotage .\nAnd this is precisely the point of psychocultural warfare , cognitive warfare , and all the mind control in our world .\nTo sideline you .\nTo assimilate you into a weak , unhealthy and dysfunctional tribe .\nA tribe of non-protestors , or worse yet , a tribe of boot-lickers .\nOf broken people who can not stand on their own , nor have any sense of self-determination .\nWe are under attack .\nYou are under attack .\nThey want to control , conquer and kill your individuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , considering that human beings have a built-in psychological drive pushing us towards individuation .\nIt was Carl Jung who elucidated the idea of individuation , noting how mass conformity dangerously makes large groups of people susceptible to the manipulation and wickedness of psychopaths who would seek to dominate large groups of people .\nJim Jones comes to mind .\nAlso Hitler , but citing parallels with Nazi Germany is super blas\u00e9 considering there are so many .\nHumans are designed to evolve , to progress , to move forward , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is , to develop one \u2019 s uniqueness and authenticity so that you can be in this world without being of this world .\nIt \u2019 s what the soul wants .\nIt \u2019 s what makes us unique and interesting , and to give it all away is to forfeit our humanity to the psychopaths who just can \u2019 t stop working out ways to control and manipulate people .\nTo maintain your individuality , you will have to become more vigilant , more knowledgeable , and more determined than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being swept away by the tidal wave of mass psychosis enveloping us .\nAnd we all need you to be strong and in control of yourself in the challenges we have coming at us .\nI teach tools and techniques to help people free themselves from self-sabotage , so they can be active participants in creating the life they want , rather than living in endless cycles of disappointment and regret .\nLater this month I \u2019 m teaching a two session master class on the root causes of self-sabotage , on specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcome this once and for all .\nYou can register for that HERE , and I look forward to meeting you .\nIn the next essay I am going to look more deeply at what psychological individuation is and why it \u2019 s so important that you stand in opposition to the

nation \u2019 s own people is deeply criminal .\nEvoking such powers to brutally enforce absolute control over peace loving citizens is a crime of truly heinous proportions .\nThe major question raised in the minds of all sentient humans is who could possibly be so devoid of humanity as to be able to enforce such a crime ?\nIn attempting to answer this question we should consider whether this form of evil stems from a recognised psychological sickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathological form of conditioning carried-out on those who willingly open themselves to being programmed ?\nA form of such conditioning is widely found to be operating within the ranks of technocratic institutions under the title \u2018 applied behavioural psychology.\n\u2019 One of a number of psychological tools used by the 0.5 % cabal seeking to establish a New World Order/Great Reset centralising power over mankind \u2013 including the theft of human DNA and ultimately the complete robotisation of human kind

and while it \u2019 s already been quite pressing over the last couple of years , we \u2019 ve tragically swapped out the nu-flu psychosis for something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !\nThe matrix demands that you

behaviors so that you \u2019 re easier to control and less likely to rebel , but the tricks it plays on you to get you to participate in the madness of the mob are growing more and more refined and diabolical .\nMaintaining your individuality is becoming more difficult than ever .\nThe other day I was re-reading some documents about NATO \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 cognitive warfare , \u2019 a new term to describe the military industrial complex \u2019 s declaration of war on the human brain .\nIt wasn \u2019 t enough to control people with propaganda , censorship , mandates and bombs , so the new push will control your thoughts and behavior using a modern synthesis of psychology , neuroscience , nanotech , biotech , social sciences , data-harvesting , artificial intelligence , and the internet .\nIt \u2019 s really too much to comprehend .\nThink of it as Mind Control 2.0 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole book at you .\nIn these documents , the braintrust at NATO \u2019 s creative warfare division has come up with some great ways to articulate the purpose and need for looking at your brain ( and everyone else \u2019 s ) as a new theatre of war .\nHere are some of my favorite quotes : \u201c If kinetic power can not defeat the enemy , psychology and related behavioural and social sciences stand to fill the void.\n\u201d \u201c It will support the combat operations by providing potential courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Environment including enemy forces , but also determining key human elements such as the Cognitive center of gravity , the desired behaviour as the end state.\n\u201d \u201c Today \u2019 s progresses in nanotechnology , biotechnology , information technology and cognitive science ( NBIC ) , boosted by the seemingly unstoppable march of a triumphant troika made of Artificial Intelligence , Big Data and civilisational \u2018 digital addiction \u2019 have created a much more ominous prospect : an embedded fifth column , where everyone , unbeknownst to him or her , is behaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our competitors.\n\u201d \u201c The human domain might well be the decisive domain , wherein multi-domain operations achieve the commander \u2019 s effect .\nThe five first domains can give tactical and operational victories ; only the human domain can achieve the final and full victory.\n\u201d \u201c Cognitive warfare is not only a fight against what we think , but it \u2019 s rather a fight against the way we think , if we can change the way people think\u2026 it \u2019 s much more powerful and it goes way beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c It \u2019 s crucial to understand that it \u2019 s a game on our cognition , on the way our brain processes information and turns it into knowledge , rather than solely a game on information or on psychological aspects of our brains .\nIt \u2019 s not only an action against what we think , but also an action against the way we think , the way we process information and turn it into knowledge.\n\u201d \u201c This is extremely important for us in the military\u2026 it has the potential , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harming the brain , it has the potential to engage neuroscience and technology in many , many different approaches to influence human ecology\u2026 because you all know that it \u2019 s very easy to turn a civilian technology into a military one.\n\u201d \u201c Cognitive warfare seeks to change not only what people think , but also how they act\u2026 Attacks against the cognitive domain involve the integration of cyber , disinformation/misinformation , psychological , and social-engineering capabilities.\n\u201d \u201c Cognitive warfare positions the mind as a battle space and contested domain .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ instigate conflicting narratives , polarize opinion , and radicalize groups .\nCognitive warfare can motivate people to act in ways that can disrupt or fragment an otherwise cohesive society.\n\u201d Executive Summary : We \u2019 re figuring out how to weaponize the internet and use the full power of all technologies to alter the way people think and how the brain works , so that we can more easily lord over an abusable class of automatons and robots who unconsciously carry out military orders while believing they are in control of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also an eye-catching phrase in these documents which I hadn \u2019 t previously heard before\u2026 \u201c psychocultural warfare.\n\u201d Hmmm\u2026 at face value it sounds like a way to create conflict amongst people by filling their heads full of nefarious BS\u2026 and guess what ?\nThat \u2019 s exactly what it is !\nPsychocultural is defined as , \u201c of or relating to the interaction of psychological and cultural factors in the individual \u2019 s personality or in the characteristics of a group.\n\u201d So , basically , psychocultural warfare is about weaponizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to others .\nGreat .\nThis is more bad news for those of you seekers out there who are still determined to live an amazing life in this system of lies and illusions .\nIt means there will be even more layers of manipulation to sort through in order to find your own sense of authority and purpose .\nAre you up to the challenge ?\nI hope so .\nAs a self-sabotage coach I look at the repetitive negative messaging in one \u2019 s environment in search for clues about why they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost always about the brain being in a distressed state so that it sinks into short-term thinking processes driven by the limbic system , which include processes related to emotion and motivation .\nWhen the brain is operating on this lower level , the subconscious mind defaults to the short-term habits that offer instant gratification instead of long-term satisfaction .\nIt \u2019 s why so many people are stuck in repetitive thought loops and destructive habits .\nIt \u2019 s why life for so many in this world of opportunity finds us living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the average , the median .\nMediocrity .\nThe brain is simply too taxed to muster the strength and courage needed to resist the tractor beam pull of social conformity .\nSelf-sabotage is truly epidemic today , which is no wonder when you consider just how much psychological and social manipulation we endure .\nAdd to that the tremendous pressures on our most basic needs of security , self-esteem , and connection , and the chronic stress of always having some major crisis to fear .\nThe natural reaction to an environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior\u2026 self-sabotage .\nAnd this is precisely the point of psychocultural warfare , cognitive warfare , and all the mind control in our world .\nTo sideline you .\nTo assimilate you into a weak , unhealthy and dysfunctional tribe .\nA tribe of non-protestors , or worse yet , a tribe of boot-lickers .\nOf broken people who can not stand on their own , nor have any sense of self-determination .\nWe are under attack .\nYou are under attack .\nThey want to control , conquer and kill your individuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , considering that human beings have a built-in psychological drive pushing us towards individuation .\nIt was Carl Jung who elucidated the idea of individuation , noting how mass conformity dangerously makes large groups of people susceptible to the manipulation and wickedness of psychopaths who would seek to dominate large groups of people .\nJim Jones comes to mind .\nAlso Hitler , but citing parallels with Nazi Germany is super blas\u00e9 considering there are so many .\nHumans are designed to evolve , to progress , to move forward , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is , to develop one \u2019 s uniqueness and authenticity so that you can be in this world without being of this world .\nIt \u2019 s what the soul wants .\nIt \u2019 s what makes us unique and interesting , and to give it all away is to forfeit our humanity to the psychopaths who just can \u2019 t stop working out ways to control and manipulate people .\nTo maintain your individuality , you will have to become more vigilant , more knowledgeable , and more determined than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being swept away by the tidal wave of mass psychosis enveloping us .\nAnd we all need you to be strong and in control of yourself in the challenges we have coming at us .\nI teach tools and techniques to help people free themselves from self-sabotage , so they can be active participants in creating the life they want , rather than living in endless cycles of disappointment and regret .\nLater this month I \u2019 m teaching a two session master class on the root causes of self-sabotage , on specific

, because paradoxically , at the top of the pyramid there always resides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invariably psychotic , having no contact with reality .\nHis psychosis is mirrored by the masses , and paradoxically , the individual is overrun by the mass so the the mass can be overrun by an individual .\nThe citizen-collective in these stories is intrinsically recognized as inhuman , unnatural , malignant and dangerous .\nIt is compassionless , irrational , illogical and excessively emotional .\nTo behold such a well-behaved and compliant hive stirs the primal fear of dying before death , of not-living while alive , and of an existence devoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories is always the lone individual who finds it unbearable to subjugate his autonomy to the herd .\nAs much as he understands the consequences for non-conformity he simply can not refuse the risk of rebellion , and is compelled to covertly express his distinctiveness .\nOnce he experiences the thrill of making some small departure from the standard , he is thereby morally obliged to further differentiate himself , ultimately arousing the fury of the state which aims to brutally suppress him in order to maintain its position of absolute authority .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ favored example of this because the book takes you inside the mind of someone who can not resist the pull of inner authenticity , self-integrity and truth .\nAroused by truth and love , the protagonist , Winston Smith , is simply incapable of squashing his internal drive towards individuation from the party-mind , and sets out on a futile endeavor

the ingenuity and creativity of individualistic , non-conformist thinking for shaping the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prosperity we enjoy today .\nThis is reflected in a few excellent quotes from some of our most revered American authors , speaking from a time when there was no herd mentality , only individuals collaborating to build something unique : Again , your best , most prosperous life is

or tribe of origin ?\nWhat do you repeatedly do , or not do , that takes your further and further from living the life you deserve and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quote by Carl Jung on the importance of expressing your uniqueness and allowing for your individuation .\nCrack the Code of Self-Sabotage and it will show you how to free yourself from self sabotage , which is the most life-changing and profitable

cheats , steals , spies , kills , maims , enslaves , breaks the laws , overreaches its authority , and abuses its power at almost every turn ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jails its own people for profit , and has no qualms about spreading its reign of terror abroad\u2014it is not a stretch to suggest that the government has been overtaken by a power elite that do not have our best interests at heart .\nIndeed

\u2019 re all the same .\nWhen the government and its Global-Industrial Deep State partners in the New World Order crack down , we \u2019 ll all suffer .\nIf there is to be any hope of freeing

make sense if you recognize them as an attack .\nFrom the old French definition , attack means to : \u201c assault , assail , ( or ) begin hostilities against.\n\u201d In our context , the attack on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waging hostilities against your independence by weakening you physically , mentally and spiritually , so that you unconsciously seek protection amongst the tribe and forfeit your potential to mass mediocrity .\nMost people have a hard time fathoming that many of the conveniences and customs in our lives constitute an attack on our well-being and personal power , yet at the same time so many are struggling with their health , their finances , and in their relationships , and find it difficult to make progress toward their vision for their lives .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ an easy way of disregarding the glaring truth about what it means to be a \u2018 consumer \u2019 today , but the fact is that we are generations deep into the total inversion of American and Western culture .\nSelf-destruction is promoted as virtuous and noble , while protecting yourself and being strong and fiercely independent are increasingly viewed as being selfish and harmful to society .\nSo , why is it such a challenge for people today to get healthy , and move effortlessly towards prosperity and wellness ?\nFor years at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the degradation of our food supply , which is now super-polluted with toxic chemicals , glyphosate , sugar , plastic , and food additives , and is generally lacking the nutrition we need to thrive .\nWe \u2019 ve documented how the medical establishment bans effective and affordable health care options in order to corral consumers into the cut-and-drug model of for-profit medicine , even though \u2018 medical errors \u2019 are the third leading cause of death in America , according to CNBC .\nWe \u2019 ve documented the financial attack on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully revealed , creating disastrous inflation that is putting the squeeze on all of us while aiming to corral us into a cashless digital fiat system that can be used to punish us for wrong-think , as is already happening in Canada .\nWe \u2019 ve looked at how the war on consciousness is aimed at outlawing opportunities to experience heightened and transcendent states of consciousness , while actively promoting and permitting self-destruction via poisons like alcohol , tobacco and opiates .\nWe \u2019 ve also looked at how the education system trains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro-establishment views and perspectives , setting them up to be workers and wage earners rather than self-reliant business owners and independent thinkers .\nAdditionally , we \u2019 ve discussed in great detail the spiritual attack , including all of its overtly Satanic and Illuminati symbolism coming from Hollywood , TV , the music industry , and celebrity culture .\nThis is accompanied by the incessant messaging of fear and fear propaganda coming from mainstream media , serving to continually lower us to base levels of consciousness .\nHow do these attacks reveal themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these negative influences create stress in our lives , and when the human body is under stress it responds physiologically by moving into what is known as fight or flight mode , which is the main factor in why people self-sabotage .\nWhen the brain is in this mode , it moves to a more base level of thinking , prioritizing short-term security and comfort over long-term success and happiness , and delivering an addictive swarm of chemical messengers to the nervous system .\nSecondly , living in a society this programmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind continually scans the environment to gauge what behaviors are most accepted and least likely to result in ostracism from the dominant tribe .\nSeeing everyone else do things to destroy their health and vitality is seen as normal , and so we do what humans are best at\u2026 imitating , mimicking and copying .\nThe longer this goes on , the more insane it all gets .\nWhen you finally understand that almost all of your behavior is the result of the subconscious mind \u2019 s drive towards inclusion among the dominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s no wonder why so many are stuck in unproductive , unhealthy habits .\nWe are weakened and far removed from our natural state of personal power , and therefore we do whatever other people are doing so as to avoid the risk of being cast out and having to find stability and security of our own merit .\nLooking at your life , what effect is all of this toxicity and self-destructive programming having on your life ?\nWhat are some of the ways in which you sabotage your own success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 re always doing more for others than for yourself ?\nHave you tried to lose weight , but just gain it all right back after making some progress ?\nDo you have financial goals that always seem just out of reach ?\nAre you stuck working a job you hate that \u2019 s taking you nowhere in life ?\nAre your relationships in chaos and full of drama ?\nDo self-medicate with alcohol , pills , TV , food , sex , or anything else just to escape the nagging feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nDo you procrastinate and avoid making decisions or taking action when you know it \u2019 s what you need to do ?\nDo you outsource your health to doctors who are less healthy than you ?\nAre you frequently stuck in looping patterns of self-defeating thoughts and hyper self-criticism ?\nWhat else are you doing that you know is holding you back ?\nLiving in the hamster wheel of life , always burning up your good energy on menial tasks , and failing to take drastic action towards your dreams is precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the the strongest , most intelligent , most proactive citizens in our society are forever locked into a pitched battle against themselves , then tyrannizing the world is just plain easy to do .\nAs a self-mastery and self-sabotage coach , I look at this issue as something that can be overcome via education , subconscious reprogramming , and by learning the skill of letting go , which gives you freedom from the negative emotional states which keep you bound to the same disappointing results you experience everyday .\nIn an upcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the cutting edge science of the mind that is being used against you everyday , and how you can reverse engineer this process to make it easy for you to succeed and win at your life .\nPart one will explain the two most important keys to unlocking the potential of your mind , and part two will be a deep dive into specific types of self-sabotage , with effective , practical tools for re-programming your life for success and happiness .\nWhen you know what \u2019 s really happening you give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the

and Your Great Reset I \u2019 m going to begin this piece with a few quotes .\nFirst , two from \u2018 The Father of Public Relations , \u2018 Edward Bernays in his 1928 book entitled , Propaganda .\n\u201c If we understand the mechanisms and motives of the group mind , it is now possible to control and regiment the masses according to our will without their knowing it In almost every act of our daily lives , whether in the sphere of politics or business , in our social conduct or our ethical thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of persons who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses .\nIt is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.\n\u201d -Edward Bernays \u201c We are dominated by the relatively small number of persons who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses .\nIt is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.\n\u201d -Edward Bernays Now a few from Israeli historian and adviser to Klaus Schwab of the WEF , Yuval Noah Harari , taken from videos of some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transhumanism is taking .\n\u201c Data might enable human elites to do something even more radical than just build digital dictatorships .\nBy hacking organisms , elites may gain the power to reengineer the future of life itself , because once you can hack something you can usually also engineer it.\n\u201d -Yuval Noah Harari \u201c Now in the past , many tyrants and governments wanted to do it , but nobody understood biology well enough , and nobody had enough computing power and data to hack millions of people .\nNeither the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but soon , at least some corporations and governments will be able to systematically hack all the people .\nAnd if indeed we succeed at hacking and engineering life , this will be , not just the greatest revolution in the history of humanity , this will be the greatest revolution in biology since the very beginning of life 4 billion years ago .\nFor 4 billion years nothing fundamental changed .\nScience is replacing evolution by natural selection with evolution by intelligent design .\nNot the intelligent design of some God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design , and the intelligent of our clouds\u2026 the IBM cloud , the Microsoft cloud , these are the new driving forces of evolution.\n\u201d -Yuval Noah Harari \u201c Today we have the technology to hack human beings on a massive scale\u2026 My brain , my body , my life\u2026 does it belong to me , or to some corporation , or to the government ?\nOr perhaps to the human collective ?\n\u201d -Yuval Noah Harari \u201c We humans should get used to the idea that we are no longer mysterious souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -Yuval Noah Harari These two perspectives on invading the private lives and minds of individuals via corporate and government influence are almost 100 years apart , and here you are , stuck somewhere in between the previous reality of the rugged individual and the projected future of technocratic enslavement to a class of corporate and governmental elites .\nSo , since you \u2019 re here and not yet there , why not take a moment to reflect on what it means to have your life hacked by such bold visionaries as Bernays and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible to undo some of the programming that makes you a hackable animal first and and a human being last ?\nWhy not consider the possibility of shedding some of the programming that makes you easy to steal from , easy to manipulate , easy to deceive , and easy to control ?\nWhy not examine the ways in which this deliberate attack on your behavioral sovereignty is already making you compliant in your own slavery and the derailment of the things which would make your life unique , interesting , purposeful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full attention to the situation in your own life to see if you can clear the clutter of so much behavioral manipulation from it ?\nWhy not use this brief moment in time , in the transition from one major crisis to the next , to seek clarity within yourself about what you would do with your life without the clever suggestions and social engineering leading you astray from a life that suits YOU ?\nThere \u2019 s an old saying that what you don \u2019 t know can \u2019 t hurt you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true .\nIn fact , in our world today , what you don \u2019 t can hurt you , and it is .\nSo many people I speak to and work with are stuck in self-defeating patterns of behavior that make it difficult for them to see through the present moment to find lasting solutions to their problems .\nThey can \u2019 t seem to overcome self-destructive habits , and they can \u2019 t seem to make significant , meaningful progress towards their most important goals .\nIt makes sense that if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 d do it .\nEasy peasy .\nBut it isn \u2019 t that simple .\nAnd because most people know what \u2019 s best for them , and they know what \u2019 s not serving them , you have to wonder why so many daily decisions , like whether or not to drink alcohol , eat junk food , or what action to take toward major goals , seem to be driven by a part of you that doesn \u2019 t want you to be healthy , wealthy , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s an open secret in our world , and when you understand what \u2019 s really going on , it \u2019 s easy to spot this in play all around you , and when you do it gives you a chance at overcoming that part of yourself which always seems to pull you backward toward mediocrity .\nThe open secret has to do with how the human mind works , how predictable it is , and how easy it is to hack .\nSomething both Harari and Bernays know very well .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy , repeat , imitate , and mimic whatever other human beings are doing , even if the behavior causes harm to themselves or others .\nThe reason for this is rooted in the scientific understanding that the subconscious mind is where 95 % of all brain activity takes place .\nBut it \u2019 s subconscious , that is , below your consciousness awareness .\nYou don \u2019 t have cognizance of what is going on down there , even though it is a LOT .\nMost people believe that their behavior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make are organic to them .\nThey believe they are actively choosing based on their own unique preferences , however , science tells a different story , and it begins in the subconscious mind .\nIn order to get people to actively participate in the destruction of their future , and to acquiesce to restrictive measures and mandates\u2026 in order to get people to believe that war is the road to peace , that censorship is needed to protect freedom , and that surveillance is required to maintain sovereignty , they have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained to relinquish their power .\nAccomplishing this is rather simple when you employ that open secret I mentioned .\nThe functional , everyday result of almost one hundred years of deliberate , elite-managed mind control , behavioral modification , and social engineering is revealed as self-sabotage .\nWhen people self-sabotage it means they engage in behavior that makes it difficult or near impossible to reach their potential and access the full gifts of their personal power .\nThey do things which take them further away from their dreams and best life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can do better .\nIt \u2019 s a self-destructive cycle which leads one down into the lowest levels of consciousness : shame , guilt , apathy and resignation .\nBecause this type of behavior originates in the subconscious mind , they don \u2019 t do this intentionally .\nIt happens below the level of conscious choice , automatically , where deeply embedded programs run .\nThis is where the mind control really lives .\nWhen people are stressed , as we all are , and when they are afraid , as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are poisoned , as most of us are , the brain defaults to lower modes of thinking .\nIn this state we simply don \u2019 t have access to our full intelligence , creativity , problem-solving ability , and ingenuity .\nWe \u2019 re triggered physiologically into what is known as fight-or-flight mode , which shifts our priorities toward overcoming our immediate need of security , safety and fulfillment .\nWe focus on the immediate danger , and seek instant gratification and relief from the feeling of fear .\nWhen the brain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is these days , functioning below it \u2019 s full capacity , we automatically seek the perceived safety of belonging to the majority tribe .\nTo venture above and beyond what the tribe is doing would mean taking the risk of being attacked by that tribe in addition to the other threats we sense .\nBelow the high IQ center of the brain our motives change from self-realization to group adherence and social conformity .\nWe look for signs about what the group is doing , and the subconscious mind tells us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , no matter if it is self-destructive , senseless , stupid , immoral , or dangerous .\nIt scans our environment looking for repetitive clues as to how to act .\nAnd this is where the mind control really reveals itself .\nLook around .\nOur environment is loaded with repetitive negative messaging coming from corporate media , Hollywood , TV , government and the corporate profiteers .\nSo much of it tells you to destroy yourself with drugs and pills , to degrade your body with surgical modifications , to ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pollute yourself with crap food and caffeine , and to avoid being wealthy or self-reliant .\nIf a person automatically , and against their natural desire for success and happiness , does things which restrict their potential in life , they become a non-threat to the elite people and systems which are counting on mass acquiescence and obedience in order to lead us all into the corral of techno-slavery .\nTo guys like Bernays and Harari who believe that you are their cattle to corral , control and cull .\nBut again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite there yet .\nYou still have options .\nYou still have a choice .\nYou still have a chance to access your power and step up to the calling of your life .\nI expand greatly on these subjects in an upcoming live zoom event entitled Crack the Code of Self-Sabotage .\nPart one is a deep dive into why we self-sabotage , and part two covers the most common types of self-sabotage and gives you very concrete , practical , effective tools to completely turn your life around .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because in the past , self-sabotage was my way of life .\nIt \u2019 s taken me years to understand why I did the things I did to myself , and of all the healing and transformational modalities I \u2019 ve engaged in on my journey of self-mastery , this is hands down the most useful and

honor and privilege of being a guest on Medicine on Call with Dr. Elaina George , on Liberty Talk FM .\nWhat a pleasant surprise to get an invite from such an accomplished physician and freedom fighter .\nMost of the people I know and associate with are advocates of liberty , informed consent and medical sovereignty , all of which are severely under attack these days .\nDr. George invited me on to primarily discuss self-sabotage , which is the key direction that my work is taking these days .\nAnd boy is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it directly relates to the covid scenario .\nPart of the reason why so many people are automatically forgoing their God-given rights to self-determination is the extreme social and peer pressure encouraged by a mainstream media , which is shockingly sponsored by the medical industry .\nIn fact , Pfizer is one of the largest sponsors of American media today , so it \u2019 s no wonder that even credible medical professionals are being censored for expressing concerns about their new mandated product , and thus get no airtime .\nWith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from popular media , it is difficult for most people to connect with their unique and intuitive inner guidance .\nGroup adherence is one of the primary drivers of self-sabotaging behavior , because we humans are wired to imitate , mimic and copy what we in the world at large around us .\nA phony consensus feels like the safest route for us , especially in such fear-driven times as these .\nWhen the mainstream media has a near-total group on the mind \u2019 s of the masses and tells them again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral thing to do is sabotage their health by turning to damaging pharmaceuticals rather than getting sunlight , eating well , exercising , and maintaining important social connections , then the subconscious mind encourages you to do the same .\nClassic self-sabotage .\nAnyhow , I very much enjoyed the conversation with Dr. George , and you can listen to it HERE , or on the media player below .\nWe of course talked in great deal about my next live zoom event coming up this weekend .\nIt \u2019 s called Crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can register HERE .\nI \u2019 d love to see you there .\nIt will give you a powerful reframing of how you interact with this world and show you how to program yourself to make success , health , wealth and happiness easy to attract .\nOh , and here \u2019 s a great little clip showing the scope of Pfizer \u2019 s influence on contemporary media .\nIt \u2019 s total insanity to pretend like our media is serving our interests and giving us the best advice on how to manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ve been in for over two years .\nDylan Charles is a self-mastery and self-sabotage coach , the editor of Waking Times , and host of the Battered

Anti-Statist: A Rebel for Our Times", "content": "The Anti-Statist : A Rebel for Our Times All flag worshipers have the same unhealthy religion : statism .\nFlag worship is a nationalist \u2019 s false idol .\nIt doesn \u2019 t matter if you \u2019 re a sieg-heiling Nazi or a little kid singing the pledge of allegiance .\nIt \u2019 s all parochial symbolism digging its tentacles into contemporary ideals .\nIt leads to blind conformity , indoctrinated complacency , bloated pride , war , and people all too happy to choke on the blue pill of blind obedience to an outdated chain of command .\nFlag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works because we are social creatures .\nBut what begins as a symbol for unifying people becomes a symbol for dividing people when it is taken too seriously or too pridefully .\nIn a world of 195 nation states , all with their own flags , it behooves us to use the same reasoning that Aristotle used when he said , \u201c It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it , \u201d and then apply it to the concept of flags .\nBetter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority .\nThat \u2019 s what anti-statists do .\nAnd so , anti-statists are free under all banners .\nStatism keeps the world divided .\nDivided people are easier to control .\nAs Maximilien Robespierre surmised , \u201c The secret of freedom lies in educating people , whereas the secret in tyranny is in keeping them ignorant.\n\u201d Anti-statists teach us how not to be ignorant statists .\nThey teach us how to rise above our cultural conditioning and how to become well-informed free-range humans instead .\nAs Nietzsche famously explained , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all cold monsters .\nColdly it lies ; and this lie slips from its mouth : \u2018 I , the state , am the people.\n\u2019 \u201d Anti-statists are here to remind us that we are NOT the state .\nWe are free individuals who require others to be free so that we can remain free .\nIt really is that simple .\nAs Albert Camus said , \u201c I rebel , therefore we exist.\n\u201d Statism only functions when unhealthy , divided individuals create an us-versus-them mentality .\nIt can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt can not continue if people realize that freedom is paramount .\nIn short : statism fails when enough people achieve a sense of freedom and wellbeing despite the state .\nSo how do you know if you \u2019 re a statist or not ?\nHere are seven tell-tale signs you may be a statist : 1 . )\nYou are a statist if you believe that you need a ruler to rule over you .\n2 . )\nYou are a statist if you believe that you require permission to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statist if you blindly worship a flag .\n4 . )\nYou are a statist if you believe that violence is the solution to problems .\n5 . )\nYou are a statist if you believe that people should be forced into doing things without their consent .\n6 . )\nYou are a statist if you believe that an authority should make decisions for you .\n7 . )\nYou are a statist if you believe in comfortable obedience over uncomfortable freedom .\nAnti-statism is an alien concept in our world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all living beings \u201c in principle \u201d and \u201c in theory , \u201d at its irreducible bedrock nature , it is exceptionally difficult to be sovereign and stateless .\nThis is because the entire world is plagued with the disease of statism .\nStatism is so second-nature to our existence that we never question it .\nWe might as well be fish questioning water .\nBut we are NOT fish .\nWe are human beings with the ability for deep logic , higher reasoning , and basic common sense .\nAs Alvaro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a government is like a fish without a bicycle.\n\u201d Fish do not need bicycles .\nJust like mankind does not need government , though he is conditioned to think he does .\nPeople are unlikely to question a system they \u2019 ve been indoctrinated into , even if that system goes against common sense , the golden rule , and the non-aggression principle .\nPeople are more likely to stick to what they \u2019 ve been conditioned to believe , whether that belief is judicial , political , religious or all three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular flavor of courage that doesn \u2019 t readily exist in the average person .\nIt \u2019 s a kind of courage that must be birthed through great psychological upheaval and the death of one \u2019 s cultural conditioning .\nIt must be nursed and cultivated daily , lest it slip back into passivity or typical , ineffective , and outdated modes of courage .\nIt must be guided by a unique and daring flavor of leadership : a radical leadership that checks and balances constructs of power and teaches others how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anti-statism .\nFreedom begins by overcoming false truths .\nA false truth is any belief that is deemed invalid according to universal laws .\nIt \u2019 s our responsibility alone to figure this out .\nNobody else can do it for us .\nIt \u2019 s our responsibility alone to question what we \u2019 ve been taught .\nWhat \u2019 s crucial to understand is that the concept of freedom is almost entirely psychological in nature .\nIn today \u2019 s day and age , it is less about breaking free physically ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about breaking free psychologically ( from comfortable covert slavery ) .\nBreaking free psychologically is rising above the cultural conditioning and reconditioning our condition .\nThe anti-statist does this with pluck and aplomb , acting as both a beacon of light for those stuck in the dark ( confused and disoriented ) AND as a beacon of darkness for those blinded by the light ( culturally conditioned ) .\nAnti-statists force us to look into the cultural mirror .\nThey teach us how to pour the statist Kool Aid down the sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deny any authority that claims we need permission to be free .\nThey teach us how to disobey inauthentic leadership and how to embrace authentic leadership instead .\nThey teach us how to become leaders who teach others HOW to think rather than WHAT to think .\nWhere statism is comfortable slavery , anti-statism is uncomfortable freedom .\nThe anti-statist is free and uses that freedom with the soul intent to free others .\nThey escape tyranny by freeing others through the symbol of their own freedom .\nThus , freedom begets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academy of Ideas said , \u201c Contrary to what statist propaganda teaches , freedom can not be imposed on us from above , nor is it created or destroyed at the ballot box .\nFreedom emerges at a societal level when enough of us recognize its value and structure our lives accordingly.\n\u201d Freedom must find its limit in justice and justice must find its limit in freedom .\nOtherwise , we either find ourselves living in a free-for-all state of chaos where anybody can do anything without any consequences ( like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re living in a violent authoritarian state with oppressive laws and the illusion of freedom ( like statism ) .\nIdeally , freedom balanced with justice and justice balanced with freedom is the healthiest way .\nHere are five anti-statist tactics to overcome statism : 1 . )\nDon \u2019 t ask for permission to be free .\n2 . )\nDon \u2019 t pay for the guards to guard you .\n4 . )\nVote with your feet : Don \u2019 t vote in , vote out .\nThough anti-statists are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they decide not to be a part of it .\nThey decide to live in the \u201c real \u201d world , a world not tainted by the unhealthy culture that the false system has created .\nAlthough the unhealthy culture is something the anti-statist must deal with , it is not something they must be a part of unless they choose to .\nThe anti-statist takes up the mantle of freedom despite authority so that you , your mother , your daughters , and even your granddaughters can one day be free from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel it is their own responsibility , as truly free humans , to do something about the unhealthy state of affairs because nobody else will .\nNobody else seems to have the capacity to do what the anti-statist can do .\nA wise man once said , \u201c All that is needed for the forces of evil to triumph is for good men and women to do nothing.\n\u201d Thus , anti-statists refuse to do nothing .\nThey don \u2019 t waste time talking about being good men .\nThey ARE good men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph .\nEven if that means they must make the goody-two-shoes and snowflakes of the world uncomfortable .\nEven if that means they must be amoral in the face of shortsighted morality and blind immorality .\nWhen the laws of a nation-state are moral and just , the anti-statist follows them .\nWhen they are immoral and unjust , the anti-statist breaks them .\nThis is because the anti-statist has become a self-ruling , self-overcoming , amoral agent unto himself .\nHe can see through the nationalism that blinds the statist and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forerunner regarding the healthy and progressive evolution of the species .\nWhere statists believe that you require permission to be free , anti-statists understand that you are required to be free .\nWhere the statist believes that only the state can provide and protect one \u2019 s freedom , the anti-statist understands that it is the sole responsibility of each individual to provide and protect their own freedom and often it must be taken away from the state .\nAs William Blake said , \u201c I must create a system or be enslaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the day , it comes down to taking personal responsibility .\nThe anti-statist teaches us all that it is our sole responsibility to realize how we are caught up in the song and dance of an extremely dangerous religion known as statism .\nStatism is an avalanche of outdated cultural conditioning that has divided the world for too long .\nIt is high time that we break the cascade of divisiveness .\nIf , as Voltaire warned , \u201c No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible , \u201d then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if enough snowflakes take the responsibility to distance themselves from the avalanche , then there is no avalanche .\nGary \u2018 Z \u2019 McGee , a former Navy Intelligence Specialist turned philosopher , is the author of Birthday Suit of God and The Looking Glass Man .\nHis works are inspired by the great philosophers of the ages and his wide awake view of the modern world .\nLike Waking Times on Facebook .\nFollow Waking Times on Twitter .", "author": "WakingTimes", "url":

writers as George Orwell , Aldous Huxley , Margaret Atwood and Philip K.

as a decisive moment before a dramatic turn of events in its trajectory .\nOthers , like myself , have referred to these times as representing humanity \u2019 s \u2018 dark night of the soul.\n\u2019 I wrote the following passage over a decade ago : We have now entered the crisis window , the transition phase \u2013 that heroic journey into the underworld \u2013 where we will be forced to experience a shamanic initiatory experience , perhaps a near-death experience , before we can emerge as an adolescent species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nUntil we reach that stage , however , we will have to struggle with the death throes of the old mind , as old systems cling to power and global infrastructures attempt to remain in control of a world in transition\u2026the \u2018 dark passage \u2019 that we are now venturing into .\nThis is part of our collective rites of passage : it will shake us , reshuffle and reorientate a great deal of life on the planet ;

this the longest gap in publishing I \u2019 ve had since the first article was posted here on November 1st , 2011 .\nWhile I recognized years ago that this project had fallen out of alignment with

about me , and about my perspective on the transformation this world is going through in our generation , and our place in it .\nI shared my views with the world via Waking Times because I had a

darkly .\nI knew there were others out there whom , like me , were unable to live in spiritual dissonance by providing unlimited counter-force to a system that is force .\nI knew that we were

a Change in Energy Hi Friends , I \u2019 m back here at the helm after some much required and well-deserved time off .\nI hope you are well .\nI \u2019 ve been taking the time lately to reach out to wise friends in my network to gather insight on the choices I \u2019 m currently facing in my personal and business life .\nIt is truly amazing what happens when you open yourself up to the guidance and mentorship of others whom you admire .\nIt moves energy .\nIt pushes things forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own mind out into the open and refocuses that energy on what \u2019 s most important .\nIn essence , this is the precise reason why I \u2019 m making changes to Waking Times .\nI am going to spend my energy in the next stage of my life directly assisting others in navigating these troubling times with courage , strength , power , and clarity .\nAnd while that was always the core mission of Waking Times , I \u2019 ve been radically re-thinking how I can participate in this endeavor while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magic it deserves , and the way I \u2019 ve been operating Waking Times for the last few years has been steadily depleting the magic from my life .\nIn 2013 I penned an article entitled \u2018 9 Key Components of the Shift Towards Higher Consciousness.\n\u2019 At the time it was simply an expression of the experience I had been having in my own life since 2004 when I found myself at the end of my rope .\nAt rock bottom .\nDuring that dark time in life I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself out of serious depression , anxiety , and addiction , and looking back now , I wouldn \u2019 t trade any of those experiences for all the riches in the world , because I learned a priceless lesson : I can overcome anything , and adaptation is the key to success and happiness .\nThat article still resonates .\nHere \u2019 s a quote : We are creatures of habit , and we tend to hang on to things a lot longer than what is beneficial .\nOften we find ourselves clutching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things long after they \u2019 ve grown lifeless .\nLetting go is a required skill for growth and evolution , but it \u2019 s hardly easy .\nSo true , and I \u2019 m certainly guilty of this .\nAfter taking a pause from posting content here at Waking Times , I \u2019 m ready to let go of some things in order to create space for new experiences and inspiration to enter and flow into my life , even though I \u2019 ve already leveled deep claw marks into this project .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes and shifting my focus a bit .\nNo , I \u2019 m not going anywhere .\nFirst off , I \u2019 m going to focus primarily on writing , rather than on posting content from other sources .\nI may occasionally share articles from some of the amazing writers and authors who \u2019 ve had a home here for many years , but I \u2019 m no longer going to attempt to keep up with current events and the latest details on all of the workings of this corrupt and evil system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re looking for , there \u2019 s an abundance of independent journalists and sites doing an honorable job of documenting all of this , and I salute them .\nI love writing , although , as a craft it is extraordinarily challenging and one which requires a fantastic amount of focus and mental acuity .\nI \u2019 ve come to recognize that it \u2019 s one of the most valuable gifts I have to offer this world , and in order to develop myself into the calibre of writer I wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my attention and energy .\nIt \u2019 s time to move some things out of the way to create space in my head and my heart , and so I \u2019 m going to focus on the perspectives and topics which , to me , are most relevant in serving to help people like you navigate the emotional and spiritual stressors of these challenging times , and eject the mind control from your life .\nSecondly , I \u2019 m moving away from the old model of funding which relied on selling advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserve our partnership .\nThis model is dead and totally unsustainable for truth tellers and free-thinkers .\nFor years , so many of us have been heavily censored , demonetized and shadow-banned , and it \u2019 s a frustrating situation to be in , knowing that the people who want and appreciate your work are unable to access it .\nFurthermore , to contribute to the bottom line of companies like Google , who play a major part in censorship and manipulation of the public , is out of alignment with the values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTo support my work and my life I will be focused on personal self-mastery and self-sabotage coaching , online events , and group retreats .\nThese are things which I \u2019 ve come to enjoy more than any other work I \u2019 ve ever done , and if you \u2019 d like to find out more about that , please subscribe to my personal newsletter here , and visit my coaching website , here .\nNext , I \u2019 m going to shift the tone of the content I produce .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the liberating notion that individuals have the capacity to wake up to the truth of their lives and evolve beyond the morass of self-destruction and negativity in our world\u2026 and I \u2019 ve strayed too far from this .\nIt \u2019 s common for people like us who care deeply about freedom and individuality to concentrate on the darkness in our world\u2026 I would know .\nIn doing so we tend to seek out an ever deeper understanding of what lies behind the veil , then develop a steadfast obligation to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight of the world and carrying the responsibility to change it all .\nWhile certainly admirable , the sense of duty to something so much larger than ourselves and so far outside the sphere of personal control creates an unhealthy imbalance for so many people I speak with and clients I work with .\nAll too often they end up neglecting the raw facts of their own life and using the noble dedication to a better world as an escape from the calamity and dysfunction in their own households .\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an unconscious distraction from facing the real responsibility of becoming their best , and along the way damage relationships and opportunities .\nFinally , I \u2019 m going to put more energy into my podcast , Battered Souls .\nHaving deep , real conversations with people who \u2019 ve survived the dark night of the soul and transformed themselves to become healers and leaders is something I enjoy most about life .\nThe last episode was with the amazing Ali Zeck , whose story of surviving psychiatric abuse and trauma is incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah , I \u2019 m going to transform my reality a bit to cultivate more calm creativity and relaxed power in my life so I can better focus on coaching , writing , and podcasting .\nThese are the vocations which bring me the most joy and give me the greatest opportunity to connect with and assist others on their journey of personal transformation , and I look forward to seeing you along the way .\nIf you hear me , and if Waking Times has inspired you or means something to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site means and the work I \u2019 ve done over the last decade , then thank you , sincerely .\nI \u2019 d love to know what you \u2019 d like to see me create here as I move forward , and how you are coping with the times we are in .\nDrop me a line at editor @ wakingtimes.com and tell me what inspires you and which topics you think I should cover .\nTell me what story you think I should be telling with this powerful and evolving platform .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ I offer as a transformational leader and coach , as I would be greatly honored to be part of your journey .\nIf you \u2019 d like to schedule a call with me to connect and gain insight on your personal challenges , please do so , here .\nI \u2019 m currently working with people on several continents , so where ever you are , let \u2019 s meet here .\nOh , and one more quick thing .\nThe comments section\u2026 what a doozie .\nI \u2019 ve always kept a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments at Waking Times , but I \u2019 m going to be more conscious of the energy I allow into my life .\nIf you \u2019 re hanging out there with nothing more to offer than insults , detractions and vulgarity , I may show up and check you on this .\nThere \u2019 s plenty of that garbage in the world , and I have no intention of being a dumpster for

truther \u2019 world , or whatever you want to call it , we talk a lot about mind control , social engineering , the manipulation of the public by corporations , and the larger agendas coming from think tanks and supranational organizations , like our fantastic reset friends at the WEF .\nWe also talk about the cognitive dissonance required to maintain a semblance of faith in governments and media organizations which continually lie , deceive , mislead , coerce and steal from the general public , and what it takes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amongst so many millions of people who love to extoll the magnificence of freedom .\nRecently I was reviewing Aldous Huxley \u2019 s dystopian classic , Brave New World , and I was reminded of just how important psychotropic slavery is to an agenda big enough to control the entire population of the world .\nEven if said population were to mysteriously dwindle to , oh , say 500 million people .\nHere \u2019 s a quote from the forward of the book : \u201c The love of servitude can not be established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , personal revolution in human minds and bodies .\nTo bring about that revolution we require , among others , the following discoveries and inventions .\nFirst , a greatly improved technique of suggestion through infant conditioning and , later , with the aid of drugs , such as scopolamine .\nSecond , a fully developed science of human differences , enabling government managers to assign any given individual to his or her proper place in the social and economic hierarchy .\n( Round pegs in square holes tend to have dangerous thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others with their discontents . )\nThird ( since reality , however Utopian , is something from which people feel the need of taking pretty frequent holidays ) , a substitute for alcohol and the other narcotics , something at once less harmful and more pleasure-giving than gin or heroin .\nAnd fourth ( but this would be a long-term project , which it would take generations of totalitarian control to bring to a successful conclusion ) a foolproof system of eugenics , designed to standardize the human product and so to facilitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brave New World this standardization of the human product has been pushed to fantastic , though not perhaps impossible , extremes.\n\u201d -Aldous Huxley , Brave New World For years I \u2019 ve ben documenting the ever-increasing usage of psychotropic medications in America , which , shockingly , has ballooned to include toddlers and infants being prescribed ADHD meds .\nSeriously .\nHere \u2019 s an article from the way back machine , something I wrote in 2014\u2026 Should Toddlers Be Medicated for ADHD ?\nNo .\nNo they should not .\nFull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message on my mind today\u2026 .\nThe pills make it possible .\nI \u2019 m no longer in the business of trying to bring people around to these kinds of unpalatable truths , because by now you \u2019 re either with us or you \u2019 re with the terrorists ( as G.W .\nwould say ) .\nThese days I \u2019 m focused on understanding how my own story and experience has been shaped by the times , and more importantly , how my story can assist others in eeking out a fantastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of giving the middle finger to the man .\nSo , here \u2019 s some notes on my personal journey .\nAnd it \u2019 s important to mention how grateful I am that I didn \u2019 t get sucked into this trap , and for how these near-misses with psychotropic slavery actually fueled my transformation .\nI had angels watching over me in some of these critical moments , so if you \u2019 re on the precipice here , like I was so many years ago , just know that I \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beaming a ginormous high-frequency lazer of courage and resolution at you\u2026 straight from my heart to yours .\nCan you feel it ?\nOutstanding .\nWhen I was in my early 20 \u2019 s I was told I had a \u2018 chemical imbalance \u2019 and was prescribed Ritalin for ADD .\nI tried it for a bit , but the side effects of not being able to sleep and always being edgy , agitated , and zoned were too much for me .\nA couple of years later a different shrink prescribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imbalance , \u2019 which he said made me bipolar .\nI stayed on that stuff for some number of months , but again the side effects of always feeling disconnected and distant were too much for me .\nPlus I noticed that I was starting to really lose my shit when I didn \u2019 t have immediate access to the pills .\nWhen I was 26 I hit rock bottom from addiction to alcohol , drugs and porn , and went to my family doctor for help .\nHe prescribed me Geodon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first dose had such severe debilitating side effects for me that I called up the doc in a panic .\nHe said that the severe dissociation and leaking prostate fluid were normal side effects that I \u2019 d get used to .\nHard pass .\nThe following week I went to a highly revered local psychiatrist who in a one hour visit felt fine with prescribing me 7 different medications to take each day .\nI asked him how long I would be on this stuff and he said that some would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would need most of these drugs for the rest of my life , again , because I had a \u2018 chemical imbalance.\n\u2019 I was different than happy , normal people , he said .\nThere was something wrong with me .\nIt wasn \u2019 t my fault , just a fit of bad luck when God was passing out chemistry sets for newborns in 1976 , or something .\nI never took any of his pills , instead throwing all of his free samples in the trash the moment I walked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychopath .\nAnd he was a legit mass murderer , but I digress .\nTwo years later when I was 28 I took one dose of a strong antibiotic , Zithromax , for an ear infection .\nThe next morning I woke up in a terrible brain fog with a host of other crippling side effects .\nI was debilitated for a year and a half , and it almost cost me my job and marriage .\nI could do very little and enjoyed even less .\nDuring that time my doctor sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had MRI \u2019 s , CAT scans , blood tests , and when a neurologist finally gave up and recommended a spinal tap I realized I was looking in all the wrong places for help .\nI went back to my doctor one last time and he was flabbergasted .\nSo , naturally he suggested it was all in my head , and he recommended a script for antidepressants .\nIn all of these experiences , no doctor ever asked me about my diet or exercise habits , and all of these doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one or two visits .\nNone of them even recommended I try therapy or counseling first , before committing to a lifetime relationship with my pharmacist .\nI \u2019 ve always been someone who operates well in the underworld , and I have a LOT of experience with street level and suburban drug dealers .\nThat \u2019 s just a part of my past .\nBut looking back now I can tell you that those dealers operate with a level of compassion and common sense that goes well above and beyond what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo again , if you \u2019 re out there sitting with a diagnosis of a \u2018 chemical imbalance , \u2019 and your intuition is still alive enough to be telling you that something ain \u2019 t right , just know that there are many of us out here who \u2019 ve been there , and we can tell you that you ABSOLUTELY have the power to overcome whatever caused you to seek help from these monsters without committing yourself to pill-bottle sized psych ward .\nI had a recent conversation with psychiatric @

and psychotropics is more effective than the force of violence for controlling the strongest willed resistors of the system .\nCheck that out if you haven \u2019 t already .\nI am Dylan Charles ,

"Where the Magic Happens I live in two worlds .\nAt least two .\nWhen I look out my window I see mountains , trees , nice cars , a safe neighborhood , prosperity and order .\nWhen I look outward through the media I see fear , deceit , delusion , destabilization , chaos , war , and all of the other 31 flavors of madness .\nIn both worlds it takes a bit of willful ignorance to avoid acknowledging the facade .\nThe facade being the illusion that what you see represents the fullness of reality .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life from my window is misleading because you can \u2019 t see the decay happening beneath the surface .\nYou can \u2019 t see the inflation , debt , addiction , waste , frustration , stress , or the constant negative chatter in people \u2019 s private minds .\nOf course , I know it \u2019 s all there , but if I \u2019 m willing to engage in delusion in order to indulge in the illusion , it \u2019 s easy to not see .\nThe same is true for the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it leads , and so the perception is all blood and guts .\nAll crisis , calamity and PR for darkness .\nThe entire truth , however , includes the reality that this world is also one of light , beauty , inspiration and love .\nAgain , it \u2019 s easy to believe that the ugliness you see is all there is , but by now you already know there \u2019 s so much more to every story , so to believe in an incomplete representation of reality is an act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you steep too long in the fantasy that you live in a perfect , untouchable , Gucci brand bubble , then you can count yourself among the ranks of the delusional .\nThe way you perceive your world matters .\nAnd this really is where the boots hit the ground .\nPerception .\nIt \u2019 s where the magic happens .\nI like \u2018 Woo \u2019 because there \u2019 s so much more possibility in it than in the archonic mind prison of scientific materialism and corporate propaganda .\nAnd possibility is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matrix steamrolls of us down a path of their own design , which resembles nothing of the world we \u2019 re capable of creating .\nYeah , I \u2019 m talking about their fiat designs of tranhumanism , technocracy , social control , conflict , scarcity and conformity .\nIf you follow the pundits , the anchors , the spokesdemons , or the so-called leadership , \u2018 it seems like total destruction is the only solution , \u2019 ( to quote Bob Marley ) .\nBut that limited perception is the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic .\nAnd since woo is akin to magic , and perception is where the magic happens , you have to wonder what magician is in charge of your perception if it \u2019 s not you .\nBut the funny thing about woo is that woo ain \u2019 t so woo anymore .\nSome woo works very well , in fact , even though the material negativism of the matrix is more than a bit slow to catch to acknowledge .\nSo , here \u2019 s the magic .\nHere \u2019 s how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , there \u2019 s two sides to this gold coin .\nPerception magic is already all around , but you mostly only see the dark magic , which does a great job of making you feel small and powerless .\nIt does a splendid job of teaching you how to destroy yourself and your connection to spirit .\nI \u2019 m talking about the consumer grade mind control which works by convincing you to see yourself as a forever member of a dysfunctional herd .\nA tribe of lessers and losers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own accord .\nThose that self-sabotage and unwittingly do the dirty work of our overlords .\nThe good stuff , though , the good magic , it \u2019 s also all around , but you don \u2019 t notice it if all you do is glance out the window .\nBut it \u2019 s there , and it can be put to work on your behalf .\nSo again , who controls your perceptions of what \u2019 s possible in your small life and the world around you ?\nWho gives you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not achieve if you were to rally the courage to breakaway from the Borg ?\nCan you shift your perceptions about your life in a way that empowers you to be better than the herd ?\nCan you create for yourself a reality which honors the full depth of reality without letting the brute force of culture tamp your potential to be of usefulness to yourself and others ?\nCan you change your perception of what \u2019 s possible for yourself so that you no longer do what everyone else is doing\u2026 being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course you can .\nWhat I really see when I look out into this manipulated world are people who \u2019 ve been conditioned to think and behave in grooves assigned to them by a seemingly untouchable system of social conditioning .\nAll happening at a time when more of them than ever are beginning to question the depth of the illusions they live in .\nI see the potential for the greatest awakening this planet has ever experienced , but one that first happens below the surface .\nThat is , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes to the evening news .\nWhat I also see are the ideas , inspiration and guidance necessary to carry those people out from Plato \u2019 s Cave and into a world of previously unimaginable possibility , which is why I do the work I do of assisting others in overcoming self-sabotage .\nSomewhere in amongst all these realities lies the perception that even though we live in a time of unbelievable deceit , delusion and fantasy , we can still shift our perception of what \u2019 s possible in our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find our potential .\nDylan Charles is a self-mastery and self-sabotage coach , the editor of Waking Times , and host of the

Loss of Soul", "content": "The non-material , or non-visible , realm does not lie dormant .\nIt is active , constantly .\nIt is what infuses and makes possible the world we know and see .\nThe intangible realm of vital forces is what we often call the \u2018 spiritual \u2019 dimension for within it lies the conscious intelligences that establish material life .\nSpiritual matters have long been an abstract thing for many people .\nYet they are no longer to remain abstract \u2013 they are now to flow into culture not only through \u2018 spiritual channels , \u2019 but through all manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow and merger between the suprasensory world and the sensory world ( the realm of the phenomenal ) , has always been in operation .\nOnly now , it looks set to increase .\nMaterialism is all good and well \u2013 yet up to a certain point .\nThis is recognized by some as the \u2018 Fall \u2019 \u2013 the deep immersion into physical reality .\nTo a certain degree , this immersion into physicality was necessary for developing individualism and to perceive existence in relation to Source .\nOnce this recognition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey \u2019 back to Source/Origin consciousness .\nHowever , if a species remains too long within the grip of materialistic forces , then a hardening \u2013 or deadening \u2013 can occur that crystallizes certain faculties and organs of perception , which leads to an evolutionary stagnation .\nAs such , the stagnation of evolvement can be due to the over-influence of entropic forces .\nThe impulse of spiritual knowledge ( developmental forces ) descending into the physical world has been opposed by other forces that do not wish for people to discover their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this moment in human development , has been foreseen and , on some levels , even planned for .\nWhat is to come about has been viewed as inevitable by those who know what is at stake .\nThe entropic forces that exist in opposition aim to \u2018 over-materialize \u2019 materialism .\nThey intend to deepen the entanglement within physical matter , and to create artificial material forms that would not have arisen in the natural course of human evolvement .\nThis is a matter of exercising certain powers upon the physical plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way as to block a renewal of human culture beyond materialism and to direct it into a new form of materialism , a more etheric form that seems un-material .\nThis is what I refer to as the \u2018 fallacy of materialism \u2019 \u2013 the digital-virtual realms , whilst seeming contrary to physical-materialism , are in fact working to deepen human entanglement in material forces .\nThese digitized spaces , because of their sense of non-physicality , are really an etheric manifestation of materialism .\nOr rather , a realm of theoretical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construct that does not need to be physical to the touch , yet it is based on , or is a projection from , a material foundation .\nWithin both the theoretical and regular mode of materialism , the human being is encapsulated within an amalgamation of material processes .\nIt is also a world of facts and external evidence that a person becomes lost within .\nAll life experience proceeds from this material realm , and this conditions the human being to gain a view of life that is factually based , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other reality except this world of materialism and factual experience .\nAny notion of the soul or spirit \u2013 the transcendental impulse \u2013 is either regarded as being a by-product from material reality or is rejected altogether as a false notion .\nThis is the power of the immersion into matter-reality .\nDeep materialism finally becomes a cosmology of entropy and decline .\nIt leads to mechanical , artificial modes of thinking that eventually brings about a stagnation in those forces driving human development .\nIf continued , these materialistic forces carve out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that further blocks vital , spiritualized forces .\nIn this route , the human being strives for greater material benefits yet neglects the vital human forces of spiritualized connection .\nOur current epoch is concerned with the development of the material world ; and if the human being is not to degenerate totally into a mere accomplice of machines , then a path must be found which leads from the mechanical impulse towards a life of the spirit .\nHowever , entropic forces are in play that are opposed to forms of spiritualization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to reduce and , eventually , dispose of spiritual seeking and to replace it with an ethereal and otherworldly \u2018 virtual paradise \u2019 where all needs can be fulfilled-by-illusion .\nA part of this \u2018 supra-materialism \u2019 is the notion of immortality that is arising through transhumanist tropes .\nThis can be referred to as the immortality falsehood as it works not through the spirit-soul but through a prolongation of the physical life experience by merger with machinic forms .\nThis is a mode of potential immortality within the physical sphere but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , it is an entrapment for it disavows the inner spirit release from the physical domain .\nThis can lead to a state of soullessness within the human being as the contact with Source becomes , over time , diminished .\nOr , perhaps this materialistic , transhumanist agenda will attract those people already without full spirit-soul incarnation .\nIt may be that there are people walking around in physical incarnation , in physical bodies , yet who are lacking , for want of a better word , a soul .\nRudolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago when he stated Steiner warned us to be aware that what we encounter as human beings in human form may not always have to be what it appears to be .\nHe stated that the outer appearance can be just that : appearance .\nHe went on to state : \u2018 We encounter people in human form who only in their outer appearance are individuals\u2026in truth , these are humans with a physical , etheric , and astral body , but beings are embodied in them , beings that make use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through them.\n\u2019 2 What this refers to is that human bodies can be vessels for other beings to operate through .\nThis makes us realize that the world of \u2018 spirit \u2019 may not always be what we have thought it to be .\nIn other words , it may not be all divine light and ascension .\nIt also involves the aspect of discernment .\nFor there are players and forces that wield a great deal of influence within the physical world .\nAnd some of these influences act through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outwardly \u2018 normal.\n\u2019 In this light , a completely different kind of spirituality is at work in present-day humanity .\nIt may be inferred , without sounding dramatic , that certain power groups , and their important individual members , are influenced ( and perhaps dominated ) by a non-human species of being that are intent on implementing non-human objectives .\nSuch groups and individuals would , in this case , exhibit a distinct lack of \u2018 soul \u2019 \u2013 i.e.\n, empathy and compassion \u2013 and would appear to others as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] Yet at the same time , such people can appear unusually charismatic and are able to exert great influence over other people , especially with their words and speeches , whilst being themselves emotionally stunted .\nTo consider this further , such beings might be motivated in their actions to attempt to block other human being \u2019 s connection to their own individual inner/spiritual impulse .\nBy a range of actions , they could focus on distracting people away from the notion of a metaphysical reality and of their inherent connection to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious intelligence beyond matter-reality ) .\nIn extreme cases , such players might even target the bio-psycho human body in an attempt to sabotage the vessel so as to make it a less viable vehicle for soul-spirit incarnation .\nWhat else might they hope to achieve ?\nAgain , referring to Rudolf Steiner , he stated that : \u2018 Their objective is to maintain the whole of life as a mere economic life , to gradually eradicate everything else that is part of the intellectual and spiritual life , to eradicate the spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallow up everything through the economic life.\n\u2019 3 By hijacking cultural , social , and economic systems , the focus turns away from the inner life , which tends to be more active once people have satisfied their primary needs ( see Maslow \u2019 s Hierarchy of Needs ) .\nAlso , if there are uncertainties , disruptions , and fluctuations in these systems , then people can become psychologically influenced in a negative way .\nThat is , for those people who come under the domination of such economic forces \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are more likely to experience a loss of personal empowerment and will .\nIf we take only a cursory glance at the actions of many incumbent leaders , politicians , corporate businesses , financial institutions , and more , we can see a clear lack of any soulful behaviour or intent .\nQuite the contrary , many of these individuals and groups seem determined to curtail human freedoms , sovereignty , and inner empowerment .\nIf Steiner were alive today , he would no doubt say that what we are currently witnessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soulless terraforming of the planet and a controlling manipulation of the human life experience by nefarious forces that have anti-human aims and intentions .\nPerhaps this is why so many people today are experiencing depression , frustration , and apathy \u2013 a paralysis of will \u2013 from which they feel unable to resolve .\nThis gets manifested as a sense of weariness and dissatisfaction that is projected out into their everyday lives .\nBecause of this , and other factors , the consciously aware person of today is being asked to step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sacred life .\nIt is important that metaphysical realities are never diminished or disowned , and that the life of the spirit remains healthy and strong in expression within physical life .\nIf there is ever a struggle against the human soul , then we may be witnessing this in these current times .\nWe would do well to remember that each person possesses that special treasure that can never be taken from them .\nAnd this is the true eternal and genuine immortality .\nThese are the times to be soulful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit .\nKingsley L.

democracy simply would not \u201c work \u201d .\nAccording to Bernays , those doing the \u201c governing \u201d constitute an invisible ruling class that \u201c understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses \u201d .\nIn Propaganda , Bernays draws on the work of Gustave Le Bon , Wilfred Trotter , Walter Lippmann , and Sigmund Freud ( his uncle ! )\n, outlining the power of mass psychology and how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group mind \u201d .\nI recently explored this topic in an essay about how occult rituals and predictive programming are used to manipulate the collective consciousness , influencing the thoughts , beliefs and actions of large groups of people , resulting in the creation of what occultists call \u201c egregores \u201d .\nHere I have extracted some key insights from Bernays in an attempt to show how his book Propaganda is , in many ways , the playbook used by the globalist cryptocracy to process the group mind of the masses .\n1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group , the people will follow Bernays tells us that one of the easiest ways to influence the thoughts and actions of large numbers of people is to first influence their leader .\nIn fact , one of the most firmly established principles of mass psychology is that the \u201c group mind \u201d does not \u201c think \u201d , rather , it acts according to impulses , habits and emotions .\nAnd when deciding on a certain course of action , its first impulse is to follow the example of a trusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group species .\nEven when we are alone , we have a deep sense of group belonging .\nWhether they consciously know it or not , much of what people do is an effort to conform to the ideals of their chosen group so as to feel a sense of acceptance and belonging .\nThis exact method of influencing the leader and watching the people follow has been used extensively throughout the last few years .\nOne notable instance that comes to mind is the horrendously inaccurate epidemiological models created by Neil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Boris Johnson \u2019 s lockdown policies .\nOnce Johnson was convinced of the need to lockdown and mask up , the people gladly followed .\n2 .\nWords are powerful and the key to influencing group emotions is through the clever use of language Certain words and phrases are associated with certain emotions , symbols and reactions .\nBernays tell us that through the clever and careful use of language , one can manipulate the emotions of a group and thereby influence their perceptions and actions .\nThe clever use of language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to great effect .\nAn obvious example of this was when the definition of \u201c vaccine \u201d was changed to include injections utilising experimental mRNA technology .\nYou see , the word \u201c vaccine \u201d is associated in the public mind with a certain picture \u2013 that of a safe , proven medical intervention that is not only life-saving but absolutely necessary .\nIf governments had told people to go get their \u201c gene therapies \u201d , the vast majority of the public would likely question the motives behind such a campaign ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase \u201c gene therapy \u201d is not associated with the same images , emotions and feelings as \u201c vaccine \u201d .\nThe same goes for the word \u201c pandemic \u201d , the definition of which was also changed .\nThe word \u201c pandemic \u201d is generally associated in the collective consciousness with fear , death , chaos and emergency ( largely thanks to Hollywood and the myriad virus films it has released over the years ) .\n3 .\nAny medium of communication is also a medium for propaganda Any system of communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or social media , is nothing more than a means of transmitting information .\nBernays reminds us that any such means of communication is also a channel for propaganda .\nBernays goes on to stress that a good propagandist must always keep abreast of new forms of communication , so that they may co-opt them as means of deliberate propaganda .\nIndeed , systems that most people would associate with freedom of speech and democracy are none other than means of circulating propaganda .\nFacebook fact-checkers , Big Tech censorship and YouTube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this category .\nOther examples of this include the recent algorithm updates made by various search engines ( including Google and DuckDuckGo ) to penalize Russian websites .\nAlthough this should come as no surprise ( Google has been engaging in this type of \u201c shadow propaganda \u201d for many years ) .\n4 .\nReiterating the same idea over and over creates habits and convictions Although Bernays terms this a technique used by the \u201c old propagandists \u201d , he , nonetheless , recognizes its usefulness .\nRepeating the same idea or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again is a form of neuro-linguistic programming aimed at instilling certain concepts or emotions into the subconscious mind .\nIndeed , people who are feeling sad or depressed are often advised to repeat to themselves an uplifting saying or affirmation .\nThere are many examples of this simple , yet effective , technique being used to great effect over the last few years .\nThink Q \u2019 s \u201c trust the plan \u201d , the globalist favourite , \u201c build back better \u201d or the incessant repetition of that twisted phrase , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this category are the 24/7-in-your-face death statistics and case numbers , aimed at promoting the illusion of a pandemic .\nThere are more obvious examples of this as well , such as news anchors in different areas all reading from the exact same script .\n5 .\nThings are not desired for their intrinsic worth , but rather for the symbols that they represent After studying why people make certain purchasing decisions , Bernays observed that people often don \u2019 t desire something for its usefulness or value , but rather because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBernays gives the example of a man buying a car .\nFrom the outside , it may appear as if the man is buying the car because he needs a means of transport , but in actuality , he is buying it because he craves the elevated social status that comes with owning a motor vehicle .\nThis idea , too , applies to the events over the last few years .\nFor example , masks are a symbol of compliance .\nEveryone knows they don \u2019 t work but they wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit in \u201d , and to be seen as an upstanding citizen who follows the rules .\nCovid-19 injections are also a symbol and many people choose to get them because they have a desire to avoid being called an \u201c anti-vaxxer \u201d or a \u201c conspiracy theorist \u201d .\n6 .\nOne can manipulate individual actions by creating circumstances that modify group customs Lastly , Bernays tells us that if one wishes to manipulate the actions of an individual , the most effective way to do so is to create circumstances that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why all of a sudden does everyone \u201c stand with Ukraine \u201d ?\nAccording to Bernays , it \u2019 s not because there is a war going on and innocent people need our love and support , but rather because it is the new \u201c group custom \u201d to do so .\nThe process of altering group customs begins from the top down .\nIn every nation or social clique , there are leaders , public figures and influencers .\nManipulating those with the most sway eventually filters down into the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrity decides to wear something extravagant on the red carpet , a whole new trend can arise overnight .\nSimilarly , at the beginning of the Covid saga and then the Russia-Ukraine war , the media were quick to circulate stories of celebs \u201c catching Covid \u201d and urging people to stay home , or public figures condemning Russian actions and calling for stricter sanctions ( which just so happened to hurt the West more than they hurt Russia ) .\nThe world is a volatile place right now .\nThings seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might happen next .\nHowever , amid all this chaos there is one thing that has not changed and is unlikely to change any time soon , and that is human psychology .\nBecause of this , the tactics used to manipulate people \u2019 s thoughts , beliefs and actions have not changed either .\nIn fact , most of them were outlined in detail 100 years ago by Edward Bernays in his 1928 book , Propaganda .\nThat \u2019 s right , the Puppet Master \u2019 s playbook isn \u2019 t a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , freely available to anyone who cares to understand

always been interested in the occult symbols that pervade our world and pollute our souls , although , my interest has little to do with esotericism or the numinous value these symbols supposedly have in unlocking some innate spiritual potential that \u2019 s been locked down by a nefarious elite .\nOh no , that potential is available to all of us without the use of black magic , sorcery , or blood sacrifice .\nI prefer Qi Gong and meditation to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people I know who are really into this don \u2019 t seem to be doing all that well in the game of everyday life .\nStay grounded , my friends .\nMy interest lies primarily in how the immense use of these symbols in popular culture goes unacknowledged and disregarded by the sleepy masses , and the effect that has on the lives of good people like you .\nIt \u2019 s a fantastic demonstration of both willful ignorance and the practical application of mass hypnosis .\nTake the music industry , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champion of occult symbolism and Satanic theatre .\nHeck , add Hollywood and the fashion industry as well , and if you \u2019 re willing to call a spade a spade ( which it is ) , it \u2019 s all one big parade of occult wannabes exploring stupid ways to cover one eye while posing like they \u2019 re about to eat a baby .\nI \u2019 ve written about this many times in articles like , Why the Entertainment Industry Loves to Use Illuminati and Occult Symbolism to Sell , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Won \u2019 t Go Away .\nOf course , those articles are all censored by Google , because , you know , public safety or something .\nBut here \u2019 s the thing .\nThe symbols are part of your life .\nThey \u2019 ve been carefully inserted into the public psyche , and have wormed their way deep into your subconscious mind .\nAnd the subconscious mind eats this stuff up while the conscious mind plays see no evil , hear no evil .\nThe subconscious is different than the conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious part of the mind interprets language and words , while the subconscious finds meaning in images and symbols .\nIt \u2019 s a fascinating part of you that can not distinguish the difference between real life , what it sees on the big screen , or what your imagination conjures up .\nIt \u2019 s all real to the subconscious .\nI talk about this in detail in Crack the Code of Self-Sabotage .\nBut the symbols are here to stay , and they \u2019 re doing precisely what they \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create the false perception that the Wizard of Oz is something much bigger and much more invincible than the pasty turd blossoms furiously typing up digital fiat notes down at the board of the Federal Reserve .\nThe symbols are there to give you something to fear without explicitly telling you what to fear .\nThey \u2019 re there to push a low level of anxiety into your life , so that your frequency is down-regulated to the lowest possible vibrations of fear , anxiety , and worry .\nThey \u2019 re omnipresent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger is also omnipresent , that crisis is the natural order .\nThey serve to impose a hierarchy in our world without directly telling you that you \u2019 re at the bottom , that you \u2019 re not a member of the \u2018 Big Club , \u2019 as George Carlin described it .\nWhen your body is chronically imbued with the tension of master vs. servant , you become a sort of food for demons .\nRudolf Steiner discussed this , as I referenced in the article , Rudolf Steiner Describes the Hostile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Anxiety .\nHere \u2019 s a quote from him on that .\n\u201c There are beings in the spiritual realms for whom anxiety and fear emanating from human beings offer welcome food .\nWhen humans have no anxiety and fear , then these creatures starve .\nPeople not yet sufficiently convinced of this statement could understand it to be meant comparatively only .\nBut for those who are familiar with this phenomenon , it is a reality .\nIf fear and anxiety radiates from people and they break out in panic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they become more and more powerful .\nThese beings are hostile towards humanity .\nEverything that feeds on negative feelings , on anxiety , fear and superstition , despair or doubt , are in reality hostile forces in supersensible worlds , launching cruel attacks on human beings , while they are being fed .\nTherefore , it is above all necessary to begin with that the person who enters the spiritual world overcomes fear , feelings of helplessness , despair and anxiety .\nBut these are exactly the feelings that belong to contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people from the spiritual world , it is especially suited to evoke hopelessness and fear of the unknown in people , thereby calling up the above mentioned hostile forces against them.\n\u201d ~Rudolf Steiner Back to hypnosis for a moment .\nThe power of hypnosis lies in embedding pillars of belief inside the subconscious mind about what \u2019 s real and what \u2019 s not .\nIf the subconscious is led to believe that you are a chicken , you \u2019 ll cluck around on stage at the comedy club like idiot chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve lost your right arm , you \u2019 ll leave it dangling by your right side as you look all around in a confused stupor and everyone one in the audience laughs their asses off at you .\nIf it believes that a million one-eyed celebrity photos are meaningless , you \u2019 ll act like it \u2019 s normal for all the a-list agents of the entertainment industry to do all their magazine cover photo shoots with stupid things like lollipops concealing one eye .\nYou \u2019 ll brush it all off as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the meaning of your life is brutally squelched into the basement of the pyramid of power .\nAs my work on this website evolves , I \u2019 m spending more time coaching people directly on how to master the parts of their lives which are lacking in potency .\nI teach them how to recognize where their energy is being misapplied and opportunity is being lost .\nI teach them how see which behaviors are organically theirs and which are holdovers from trying to fit in to a dysfunctional tribe .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition of self-mastery that I \u2019 ve found is phrased as a question : So much of the endeavor of self-mastery begins with emotional mastery .\nThat is , are you operating on an even emotional keel throughout each day ?\nIf not , you \u2019 ll be carried away by the negative emotional patterns programmed into you by a culture infested with the symbolic cues of a sick power structure , and suffer as demon food as described by Steiner .\nYou \u2019 ll find yourself stunted by chronic overwhelm , routinely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a blind effort to give your subtle body some sense of relief from the chaos of operating at the lowest possible frequencies of human consciousness .\nYou can do better , and it begins with recognizing , and thereby diffusing , the influence of the symbols and self-destructive

world \u2019 s most famous equations is Einstein \u2019 s E = mc2 where energy equals mass times the speed of light squared .\nI am now proposing my own equation , which likely will be nowhere near as recognized or celebrated .\nNevertheless , I feel it has worth sharing .\nHere it is : M = EC2 What does it signify ?\nIt means : meditation equals extended mind times contact and communication .\nAt this point , I feel that some explanation is required .\nHere goes .\nPhilosophers , artists , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions concerning human consciousness : what it is and how it emerges .\nThe question of human consciousness has also been at the heart of many wisdom teachings , although these have tended to be based on revelation rather than investigation and empirical research .\nOver the course of these varied discussions , debates have been divided between the materialistic approach ( the mind is contained in the brain ) , and what may be rather loosely termed as the \u2018 spiritual-metaphysical \u2019 worldview ( the mind exists outside of the brain ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the advance in technologies , scientists have been able to map and study the human brain \u2013 including neuronal patterns , brain disorders , and pathways of human thinking .\nYet this has led , in main , to an increased certitude among many scientists of a material view of human consciousness .\nIn other words , consciousness exists as a by-product of the physical brain and , as such , can not exist without brain function .\nThis is the dominant view amongst materialist thinkers and scientists .\nIn more recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research into nonlocal and field phenomena , investigators have been re-visiting mainstream theories of human consciousness .\nSpecifically , as the unified field theory gains more support pointing to the nature of a nonlocal , interconnected cosmos , a different perspective is emerging on how consciousness may operate .\nAnd an understanding on the true nature of consciousness will validate and give meaning to the act of meditation ; specifically , how meditation may provide access to contact , and possibly communication , beyond the material realm .\nFirst , we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness .\nThe dominant mainstream narrative concerning human consciousness is that it is generated by the brain as a form of by-product .\nThis has been referred to as the \u2018 turbine theory , \u2019 whereby just how electricity would be generated by a working turbine as a by-product , so too is human consciousness the by-product of a functioning human brain ( motor ) .\nThis theory postulates human consciousness as being local and produced from something tangible .\nAlso , when this producer/motor stops functioning \u2013 i.e.\n, the brain ceases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and related streams of experience , likewise stop .\nMedical science has gone a long way to validate the \u2018 turbine theory \u2019 of consciousness by repeated experiments on how impaired brain functioning results in distorted consciousness .\nThe basic premise of this understanding of consciousness is that neuronal networks in the human brain have evolved to such a high state of complexity that they produce a level of self-consciousness above that of any other animal on the planet ( except perhaps dolphins , porpoises , and whales ) .\nHere , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living creature is related to the level of biological complexity .\nIn recent years , there have been renewed calls for a neurological basis for consciousness .\nFor many scientists working in this field , consciousness is a by-product of complexity ; thus , complex systems produce varying levels of consciousness , and \u2018 how much consciousness they have depends on how many connections they have and how they \u2019 re wired up.\n\u2019 [ 1 ] Despite recent scientific theories of consciousness , most still cling to the basis of an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , that consciousness is a secondary phenomenon resulting from primary activity located in the human brain .\nRegardless of the attempts by mainstream science to strengthen their outlook on consciousness , this \u2018 complexity-produces-consciousness as a by-product \u2019 perspective has so many holes .\nThe many holes in this dominant yet conservative theory is owing to a range of experiences that throw doubt upon its validity .\nChallenges to the turbine theory of consciousness have come , as one example , from increasing evidence of \u2018 after death \u2019 conscious experiences .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceases when the brain dies \u2013 i.e.\n, no generator , no current .\nFor many , this may seem like an obvious deduction .\nHowever , evidence to the contrary clearly contradicts this theory .\nMany cases have shown that human consciousness is maintained even though a person is technically declared brain dead .\nThe near-death experience ( known as NDE ) has been reported by sufficiently large numbers of people who were declared brain-dead .\nConscious experience in brain dead people has been reported in almost 25 percent of tracked cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely researched and discussed by many credible sources .\n[ 2 ] Furthermore , this phenomenon is not new and there are accounts of NDEs occurring in medieval times .\n[ 3 ] The existence of consciousness \u2013 a by-product of brain activity \u2013 in the absence of brain function can not be accounted for by the mainstream turbine theory .\nThere are also numerous indications that human consciousness exists in cases of permanent death .\nThat is , many years after a person has died their consciousness remains available for contact and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of ESP .\nThere is now enough credible evidence to put doubt into the mainstream theory that consciousness is solely a by-product of localized brain activity .\nOne way to account for these anomalies would be to suggest that consciousness is in some way conserved beyond the brain \u2013 that is , as a nonlocal phenomenon .\nIn this hypothesis , consciousness is something stored external to the brain .\nThis can be framed in terms of a \u2018 cloud theory \u2019 of consciousness , as this is similar to how information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by computer networks or other cloud-enabled devices .\nLikewise , using this analogy , the mainstream \u2018 turbine theory \u2019 of consciousness would be akin to an old-fashioned computer without Internet or built-in-memory that would lose all its data once switched off .\nIn this regard , the cloud theory posits consciousness as nonlocal , rather than localized within the brain .\nFurthermore , the cloud theory allows for not only individual consciousness to be stored , and be recalled , but multiple .\nThis perspective of accessing multiple consciousnesses , beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s collective unconscious .\nThis theory would appear to support the observations of psychiatrists and consciousness researchers who have induced altered states of consciousness in their clients , including past life regression .\nWhen in altered states a vast majority of people have the capacity to recall almost everything that has happened to them , as well as in previous life incarnations .\nMoreover , their recall is not limited solely to their own experience but can also include the experiences of other people as well .\n[ 4 ] This cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collective field of consciousness that makes complete information available relative to the mode of access .\nThis perspective shares similarities with the scientific research on the Akashic Field [ 5 ] and Morphic Resonance .\n[ 6 ] However , despite the appropriateness of the cloud theory of consciousness , it too does not account for all observations .\nIn various recorded accounts of altered state consciousness , it appears that contact/access is not only made with traces of one \u2019 s nonlocal consciousness but also with distinctive separate conscious intelligence .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the consciousness of a human being .\nSuch experiences , once the realm of mystical , shamanic , or indigenous traditions , has increasingly entered mainstream culture .\nPreviously , such \u2018 encounters \u2019 were labelled as supernatural or simply conveniently ignored as a quirky anomaly .\nHowever , as western science has developed its exploration of the inner realms ( such as in transpersonal psychology and similar practices ) , such experiences have become more widespread and thus need to be accounted for .\nFrom this evidence a remarkable conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and often communicate , with conscious entities that not only manifest a sense of self , but also carry distinct memories and information .\nThis experience can neither be accounted for in the mainstream turbine theory nor the cloud theory of consciousness .\nWe now need to consider yet another concept \u2013 that consciousness is a unified field phenomena with holographic qualities .\nThe unified field theory posits that consciousness may manifest in spacetime yet originates from a source that exists in a realm beyond spacetime .\nIn other words , consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in a \u2018 unified source field \u2019 ) and yet manifests through physical-material reality .\nThis concept would suggest that all forms of localized consciousness are expressions of a unified consciousness field that is beyond spacetime .\nThe implications of this understanding are that consciousness is not \u2018 in \u2019 the brain , \u2018 produced \u2019 by the brain , nor \u2018 stored \u2019 beyond the brain .\nRather , the human mind is a localized aspect of a conscious intelligence that infuses the cosmos from its source beyond spacetime .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many people .\nHowever , when we examine the phenomena that is consciousness , this perspective makes a lot of sense .\nThe viewpoint of this new model says that the brain receives and interprets consciousness , which is an interrelated aspect of the cosmos , and then projects this as the individual mind .\nYet the brain does not produce consciousness .\nThis understanding , which is now increasingly supported by the very latest scientific findings , points toward a Unified Source Field ( USF ) as generating what we perceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thus a holographic projection , coded from an underlying cosmic intelligence-field .\nIt is this underlying intelligence-field that is the source of all material reality and conscious life .\nEvery element that emerges into physical reality is simultaneously interrelated with the underlying Unified Source Field .\nAs such , each material element in existence is also in contact and communication with this unified intelligence-field .\nHuman consciousness \u2013 the human mind \u2013 is at all times connected to a deeper dimension of Source consciousness .\nThe understanding that consciousness originates from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been embraced by many well-known spiritual figures , mystics , visionaries , artists , and even a handful of intuitive scientists .\nIt may one day come to represent the dominant understanding amongst humanity ( as it perhaps once was ) .\nThe universe has already been recognized by mainstream science as exhibiting an incredible \u2013 almost impossible \u2013 degree of coherence .\nNow we may know why this is .\nIt is because there is no random cosmos , no separation of materiality and immateriality , no empty space , no \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 Everything \u2013 absolutely everything \u2013 is an integral part of a nonlocal conscious field whose origin is a Unified Source Field ( USF ) existing beyond the spacetime dimension .\nWhat this implies is that there is an inherent form of order to the material dimension .\nThe cosmos , and all aligned aspects within it , adheres to an intelligent , conscious impulse toward coherence and connection .\n[ 7 ] Perception too , as an attribute of consciousness , trends toward greater conscious coherence ( awareness ) and connection .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ connectivity , I suggest , is an urge for conscious awareness of Source ( the Unified Source Field ) .\nAnd so , this leads me back to the equation at the beginning of this essay ; what I call the meditation equation : M = EC2 .\nMeditation equals extended mind times contact and communication .\nMeditation has from time immemorial been a part of human life , even if not formally recognized as so .\nMeditation can take only a second .\nA quick pause of chatter in the mind .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ A transitory step back from the entanglement in physical reality .\nA fleeting respite from external stimuli .\nA brief break from the outer world to focus upon the inner .\nAnd the inner world is expansive \u2013 it is where the origin resides .\nAnd in this state , contact can be made with those aspects in existence beyond our material reality .\nAnd with contact can also come communication .\nAs human beings , we are already in contact and communication with aspects beyond our perception or acknowledgment .\nWe only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe inner nudge , the inspirational idea , the coincidental happening , the inexpressible sense , the indescribable knowing .\nThese are the contacts humanity has .\nWhat if we consciously take it to the next level by intending to listen to such contact ?\nWhat if we then ask for communication ?\nWe can give ourselves permission to start asking for contact and communication whilst in a meditative state .\nBy showing acceptance , and readiness to allow for contact and communication beyond our physical senses and sense-reality , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And life wishes to communicate amongst itself .\nSentient life wishes to be heard , and to share .\nLife is not meaningless nor without purpose .\nOur inherent connectivity transcends localized space and time .\nThe human being is intrinsically connected with the cosmos and with Source consciousness .\nOne day , it is hoped , this understanding will be , for all of us , as clear as pure water ; and we will laugh gently to ourselves thinking how it could ever have been otherwise .\nKingsley L.

distraction.\n\u2019 I hear that a lot .\nIt \u2019 s all just a big distraction .\nBut a distraction from what , exactly ?\nI \u2019 m going to zoom all the way out for a few hundred words here .\nAll the way out beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing down on all of us .\nAll the way out beyond the cultural revolution underpinning the agendas being pimped on us by mainstream media .\nAll the way

we need to wonder about the big picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the courage and humanity to be found within that .\nWe need to wonder what we truly are , without all the dense commentary and negative

, and of concern is the potential risk of being plunged into deeper states of materialism and automatism .\nThese two states are often in cooperation together , for the deeper we become embedded in material forces then the greater are the influences that can make us act without conscious thought or intention .\nIt can also be said that there are certain forces , or agents , in this current time that are pushing for greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or prevent humanity \u2019 s spiritual development .\nIn this regard , even the notion of anything \u2018 spiritual \u2019 has come to be either ridiculed , diluted into commercialism , or hijacked into pseudo-spiritual forms ( such as corporate retreats and online guruism ) .\nIt is important that we now cast a critical eye upon the state of human society and the nature of our times .\nThis is not to criticize but to draw attention \u2013 to be aware of its aspects \u2013 as if to shine a light upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the \u2018 scenery of external affairs.\n\u2019 For those people caught up within the external civilization of the moment , with its impacts , distractions , and stimulations , it is difficult to acknowledge the existence of knowledge and perceptual understanding that lies beyond the conditioned senses .\nYet it must also be said that now is the time for people to live , and be guided , more in accordance with inner , or esoteric , principles than ever before .\nIt is this connection with one \u2019 s inner life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd without this awareness , this degree of perceptive insight , then we allow greater concentrations of power to be wielded in the hands of the few , who will exercise this control over the masses in a negative way .\nWhat is necessary is awareness and intention emerging through each individualized person .\nIt is this state of individualization , as opposed to group/mass behaviour , that marks the correct stage of human development for these times .\nTaking the work of Austrian thinker/mystic Rudolf Steiner , the state of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating to three soul stages : sentient , intellect-mind , and consciousness .\nWithin the stage of sentient soul ( i ) , the human being lives primarily within the world of the senses .\nThey are drawn into their passions , desires , and are easily manoeuvred or manipulated into following trends , politics , and mass movements .\nThese people form the majority , are swayed by the media , and are the general masses that move with the machinations of the mob .\nThey are influenced by the \u2018 influencers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and swim in the mainstream .\nThe second stage , that of the intellect-mind soul ( ii ) , represents the person of the intellect who strives to free themselves from the rash impulses of the senses .\nThey are aware of these tendencies yet steer themselves by rational thinking .\nThey also attempt to keep their feelings under check and express their heart \u2019 s desire through critical engagement .\nAt the same time , this rational ordering often allies such people with conservatism , dogma , ideologies and a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , so too can they be manipulated by their own allegiance to fixed systems .\nThey can be blinded by ideals and uncritical of their own weaknesses .\nSuch people can appear exceedingly clever whilst lacking humanity .\nBroadly speaking , such people fill the ranks of the political and leadership organizations .\nAnd the third stage , that of the consciousness soul ( iii ) has yet to fully emerge within the current epoch .\nIt is this stage that deals with the formation of the aware individual who is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses , and the strategies employed for these persuasions .\nThe phase of individualization within humankind was , and continues to be , a necessary step to release the human being from the previous mode of group consciousness .\nThe egoistic self was required in this transference into individualization .\nYet the danger now is that this operational ego grows beyond its function and becomes a dominant aspect of the human being .\nActing and striving from the egoistic self is what leads to the imbalance and inequality of the world .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased egoism , yet this is a necessary relationship to reach the depths of self-realization .\nIt becomes troublesome when the ego , instead of leading to inner growth , gets projected externally and becomes the major aspect of the outward personality .\nThis can lead to stunted inner growth and continued external ego projection .\nThe extremity of this is when a person sinks back into group consciousness and seeks security within a group environment .\nThis can lead to cultic tendencies , as well as nationalism and other ideological and religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in world affairs has been the pull between the dominant egoists and the group mentality masses .\nHowever , it can also be recognized that this stage of growth has to be lived and experienced in order to be moved through .\nThe strains and stresses increase when people seem incapable , or are disallowed , from moving beyond this stage of human development .\nIn this case , the person remains at the level of the lower \u2018 I \u2019 , which is a mass phenomenon and below that of full individualization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of the personality , and this can literally run amok , getting entangled in passions , persuasions , disagreements , and disputes .\nThe worst case of affairs is when societies establish structures , systems , and forms of management that cater to this lower stage of human development .\nPeople are then caught in a loop , where the base behaviours of this lower individualization are sustained and supported , deliberately creating a civilization of stagnation and stunted growth .\nThe task here is for people to take the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The human being must establish an intention to develop their aligned individualization for it seems that there are forces opposed to this human evolvement .\nFor this reason , it is now essential that a perceptive state of consciousness ( referred to in Steiner terminology as the consciousness soul ) is allowed to emerge among those people receptive and prepared for this .\nThe consciousness soul can be said to elicit higher morals and values within the individual .\nThis requires also that the person has an inner freedom and the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social conditioning .\nThis is a form of perceptual thinking as opposed to programmed thinking .\nThe human being has it in their power to transform themselves whilst participating in active life .\nIn fact , life provides friction for the transformational process .\nAnd this transformation takes place in the innermost self , which later can be projected outwards into life .\nIt is not enough to affect correct behaviour if the inner life is stunted ( as is the case with so many people , especially those most visible upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it : Steiner also considered entropic forces ( what some would call \u2018 evil \u2019 or de-evolutionary forces ) as a necessary part of human development .\nSuch forces create the friction that fuels potential development , such as the friction between the road and the tyre helps create the movement of the car .\nTo a degree , such forces are unavoidable in physical existence .\nAll development is a matter of stages , and each stage must be reached before attempting the move to another .\nWhere is humanity at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may wonder ?\nEach person must decide for themselves how they wish to live life .\nIt can be said that a person who is ignorant of this decision , or who negates making such a decision , is more likely to fall under the sway of entropic forces , for it is these forces that target/attract the unaware or lazy souls .\nThis recognition should encourage us to make perceptive choices in life .\nIn every sphere of human life \u2013 whether social , cultural , or political \u2013 there are forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of greater magnitude than most people are able to realize .\nThere are \u2018 universal forces \u2019 that have been in contention \u2013 in motion \u2013 for a very long time .\nAs for human beings , all motion , all movement , requires effort .\nThat the many are unaware of this , only places more emphasis upon the responsibility of the few who are aware .\nThis has always been the case and is likely to remain so for the time ahead .\nThe inner impulse towards working for the greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good \u2019 \u2013 comes out of genuine understanding and not general emotions or mass psychology .\nIt is also the responsibility for such aware individuals to gain an understanding , a level of perspective , for perceiving the events of our time .\nIt is this understanding of forces behind events at face value that helps in the growth of the consciousness soul .\nJust as we can recognize there are occult forces in play in the physical realm , so too does this suggest that there are forces operable beyond the physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as seeing the branches of a tree swaying in the wind and to consider that the branches are moving of their own accord and under their own volition .\nIt is a fundamental error to mistake secondary phenomena for primary causes .\nAnd when a person acts out of limited understanding , there is the potential to serve not the good but ultimately the contrary .\nIn terms of entropic forces ( my term for \u2018 evil \u2019 ) , they can not be banished for they form a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be transmuted into good for them to be overcome .\nAnd this is the task of our times , the task for the spiritual soul of today .\nWhat is needed is a re-cognition and refocusing upon metaphysical realities .\nRudolf Steiner stated that if all human beings were to decide that they did not want higher development , then this potential for development would come to an end .\nIt is therefore the responsibility of those with awareness , and inner cognition , to maintain within humankind the urge for inner evolvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people today is to seek out that knowledge which comprehends not only world forces but the primary causes of events in this phenomenal , physical realm .\nIn doing so , the person is able to raise themselves beyond petty inclinations and selfish , egoistic behaviour .\nThis is not a denial of physical reality but rather a strengthened recognition of the primary realm of spirit .\nTo conclude , it can be said that there are forces coming through into this realm that humanity has limited knowledge or experience of .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for these forces are a part of humanity itself .\nWe-You-I are part of the same consciousness , only that material existence \u2013 the physical life \u2013 has split , divided , and splintered these aspects .\nHumanity , for the most part in recent times , has been living as if a partial existence \u2013 a semi-existence \u2013 for it has been cut-off from recognition of its Source and the greater field of consciousness .\nThe planet Earth , as well as other planets in the solar system , are entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier for these correspondences to be made .\nThat this age was coming has been known for a long time by other groupings that have power and influence within human civilization .\nFor this reason , these groupings have come together to create conditions across the planet \u2013 physical , mental , psychical \u2013 that would attempt to halt the emergence of greater perceptive consciousness .\nThe attempts being made across the planet are for the realization of anesthetizing certain aspects of the human being so that it is less receptive to \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondences .\nIn other words , humanity is being further cut-off from its inherent connection to developmental impulses .\nYet this approach has only a limited range of success .\nHumanity \u2019 s faculties can only be \u2018 blinded \u2019 for so long .\nEvolutionary , developmental forces are far more powerful than supposed by these planetary power groups .\nAt the same time , we need to recognize that events of world history are symptoms of the occurrences on the metaphysical level of reality , where primary , non-material aspects have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their impulses that come into being within the physical world of secondary phenomena .\nFor most of humankind , these primary aspects are the unknowables .\nIt is time to become receptive to the forces available to us so that as a human being we can be of assistance rather than ignorant or , worse still , a hindrance .\nFor those people capable of developing their understanding and receptivity to such impulses , it is time to begin the journey to know of the unknowables .\nKingsley L.

bigger than the existing condition ?\nThe potential reconditioning force of the void .\nThe void is between worlds even as it creates worlds .\nIt is the primal source , the vital core , the perennial roots , the primordial seed .\nIt is all at once a lodestone , a whetstone , a steppingstone , and a Philosopher \u2019 s Stone .\nIt \u2019 s the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target , the flow state between the bowman \u2019 s mind , the arrow , and the bull \u2019 s eye .\nIt is the pivot point where all points point .\nIt is the darkness that shines all light .\nIndeed .\nThe seed of somethingness can only grow from the heart of nothingness\u2014the almighty void , the birthplace of all things , the great womb from which we are all born .\nEven the status quo is merely one of its infinite creations .\nThe void is not only a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birthplace of order .\nIt \u2019 s the state in which the caterpillar is annihilated in the cocoon .\nIt \u2019 s the place where the Phoenix is reborn .\nIt \u2019 s a sacred space where bludgeoned aspects of the profane status quo can unwind and flourish .\nIt \u2019 s a vital humus for human creativity .\nEven regarding imagination , the void is the state of mind where No-mind and mindfulness intersect to become curiosity and wonder .\nThose of us mindful enough can tap into the curiosity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stifled certainty of the status quo .\nFrom the seat of No-mind ( healthy detachment ) , we see how everything is connected to everything else .\nWe see how the mind of Everything holds the heart of Nothingness , and the void of Nothingness holds the core of Everything .\nSometimes in order to open our mind we must lose it .\nSometimes in order to cultivate mindfulness we must embrace No-mind in the void .\nSometimes the only way to discover that the \u201c door to our jailcell is open \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us into thinking that we were trapped in the first place .\nThus , the power of the void is the power of

rigidity , self-seriousness , excess , and stillbirth .\nIt is our responsibility alone to flip the script , to turn the tables , to push the envelope , and to stay ahead of the curve .\nNobody else can do it for us .\nIf we can gain mastery over the void , we can gain mastery over the status quo .\nJust as the master must integrate the darkness within him to become whole , we must integrate the void within us to become creative .\nOtherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otherwise , we drown in cultural conditioning .\nOtherwise , the Matrix has us by the balls , and the blue-pill-poppers will have outflanked our red-pill-popping courage .\nBut if we can gain the courage to create through the integration of the void , we can avoid the stifling trap of the status quo .\nWe can rise above stagnation , complacency , comfort , and certainty .\nWe can transcend the unhealthy scene and transform ourselves into a thundercloud fat with healing rain .\nWe can seize the lightning that splits the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split .\nRealizing that we are the split .\nWe always have been .\nAnd that \u2019 s okay .\nWe attain healthy detachment by understanding that we are a creature that must constantly negotiate its own delusionary attachment to being a thing separated from cosmos .\nThe power of the void is the power of holistic detachment in the face of illusory attachment .\nFrom the void we can see how our tiny self is outflanked by the mighty cosmos .\nWe can see how petty our stress , anxiety , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme of things becomes a mighty hammer that shatters the glasshouse paradigm of our small-mindedness .\nThe void teaches the power of rebirth and creation from the ashes of death and destruction .\nIt digs up the skull of God and props it up like a scarecrow .\nIt drags the

control sought by the technocratic fascist takeover of planet earth , currently underway .\nThe controllers absolutely can not tolerate protest , dissent or even abstention from their insane agendas , and so it \u2019 s necessary for them to ensure that individuals are unable to express contrarian viewpoints .\nTheir plans simply won \u2019 t fly without mass obedience , or at least the perception thereof .\nIf you won \u2019 t automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tossed into your path , you must be singled out before you create a ripple of dissension among the hive .\nAnd so the cage to contain you is taking form .\nAdvertising , public relations , propaganda , Hollywood , TV , mainstream media , celebrity culture , and influencers comprise the first tier of social control .\nThese entities serve to ubiquitously present an example of what behavior , ideas and beliefs are required in order for you to blend in amongst the herd .\nThey shape your behavior through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is accepted and expected , and your subconscious mind gets the message loud and clear .\nThe second tier is official censorship , corporate censorship , and cancel culture , which all aim at outright silencing dissenting viewpoints .\nAs a bonus , this tier is multi-dimensionally effective .\nThere are those people whom are directly censored and/or booted off speech platforms ( like ourselves here at Waking Times ) , plus the additional compounding effect of self-censorship , which is the semi-conscious self-regulation of one \u2019 s speech in order to conform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to avert risks of doing so .\nI discussed this in detail in a 2018 article entitled , George Orwell Warned us of the Most Dangerous Type of Censorship \u2013 And It \u2019 s Happening Now .\nThe third tier , emerging before our eyes , will involve the use of advanced technology , AI , machine learning , and algorithmic monitoring of your speech in public , and eventually in private , in order to silence you immediately and met out instant retribution for vocalizing wrong-think .\nI \u2019 m writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recent article from France 24 entitled , Dutch clubs to deploy \u2018 smart technology \u2019 to fight fan racism , which is a clear demonstration of what tier 3 will look like .\n\u201c Three top Dutch football clubs are taking part in pilot projects using smart technology including artificial intelligence to identify and fight racist behaviour by fans , the country \u2019 s football federation announced Wednesday\u2026 .\nAt PSV , which is closely liked with Dutch technology giant Philips , cameras and sound equipment are to be used to measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly to the fans to motivate them and sing along.\n\u201d Computer programmes using artificial intelligence will be able to pick up objectionable shouts and alert human officials who can watch a replay , the KNVB said .\nAt Zwolle , in the country \u2019 s east , visitors will go to games with their tickets on their phones

profiled and singled out according to their social beliefs before they \u2019 ve ever even crystallized such ideas within their own minds .\nIn fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wet-dreams of the Klaus Schwab and his crew was to develop the tools to be able to read-people \u2019 s minds as they were engaging in international travel in order to identify their intent .\n( If anyone reading this can find a

internet long enough to know what people expect to see and hear in an article , and also long enough to know what \u2019 s really missing from most of the content on the web today .\nIt is heart that is missing .\nIt is genuineness .\nAnd it \u2019 s real talk about the actual experience of life we \u2019 re all trying to have against the backdrop of madness , stupidity , insanity , confusion , and superficiality .\nSo , here \u2019 s a transmission straight from the heart .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ first ask , what really matters most to you ?\nYou get a gold star if your answer was something like people or relationships .\nNow let me ask you , do you intentionally honor the most important people and relationships in your life with your actions , thoughts , presence and being ?\nOr have the most sacred things in your life become mundane , routine , and devoid of their richness ?\nMost importantly , have you even noticed ?\nI just had an experience which reawakened me to what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable aspect of being human\u2026 Connection .\nSpecifically , the right kind of connection with the right people .\nThe one \u2019 s whom really matter .\nHere \u2019 s what I see happening in our lives , and it is very important , yet too easily disregarded , so pay attention .\nThe immaterial things which make our lives truly worth something are systematically debased by the culture of exploitation and superficiality built up all around us .\nThere \u2019 s a materialistic , matrix energy pervading and perverting everything sacred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to trade one for the other without realizing what we \u2019 re giving up .\nIt turns sacred relationships into transactional relationships , twisting your perception of what it means to be connected to someone .\nIt supplants intimacy with functionality .\nIt trades quality for quantity .\nI think Pink Floyd said this well\u2026 It \u2019 s how things go these days .\nWe constantly make unconscious trade offs in our mindless drive to conform to the twisted and gloriously repeated ideas and suggestions of what life should be about .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attention\u2026 whatever .\nWe don \u2019 t recognize the debasement of the sacred aspects of our lives until the relationships have turned cold , withered and half dead , which is typically what it takes to shake us out of the stupor of the hustle , task completion and distraction we live in .\nBut it \u2019 s the depth of our relationships which offer the greatest source of inspiration and hope to any and all of us .\nThere \u2019 s something deep we need from them , that just isn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commoditize them .\nTo see what I \u2019 m getting at here , ask yourself why you do the things you do , and be courageous in your honesty when you listen for the answer to surface from within .\nFor example , I am an artist and a DJ , but why do I do things ?\nOr more importantly , why was I originally drawn to these activities , and how has my relationship to art and music shifted and been corrupted over time ?\nDo I still do them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same reasons , or has my intention been warped as I \u2019 ve been entrained to compare my work and purpose in it to what is seen in the intangible , omnipresent ether of culture ?\nIn the beginning it was easy for me to create , to produce and to enjoy my art , because my intention for doing any of it was pure .\nI sought nothing other than a vehicle of expression for something within my soul that required a medium richer than mere words to come to life .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present relationship I have with my art I see that my creativity has been stifled by imposing on it the cultural demand of the necessity of it being of value in marketplace terms .\nHere \u2019 s another example .\nIf you are blessed to have true love in your life , what was it that originally drew you and your lover or partner together ?\nWhat is that keeps you together now , and has the story of what you really need from each other changed ?\nHas your once special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success for you ?\nHave you begun to measure your value to each other in one-dimensional terms like sex or financial support ?\nHave you rewritten your story together into a dry , transactional tale of \u2018 you give me this and I \u2019 ll give you that ?\nIn essence , our culture subtly and steadily encourages us to create our lives and relationships from the energy of force rather than power .\nWe try to force ourselves into the box of what it seems is expected of us .\nWe forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy more so than the coarsely homogenized meaning professed by Netflix and other mass market content creators .\nSo , what does human connection mean to you ?\nWhat does it mean for you to have quality in your relationships ?\nWho are the most important people in your life , and what is the essence of your relationship with them ?\nWhat does it really mean to you , how is that measured , and how do know if you \u2019 re sincerely honoring these for the fullness of what they bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participated in the unconscious exploitation of something which should always remain revered and wholly sacred ?\nHere \u2019 s another quote which speaks to this\u2026 \u201c The one who lives inside is awash in colours , tones , and symbolic ritual displays of an extraordinarily precise attunement to the heart and soul of ancient wisdom .\nYou are suspended in a long-ago time .\nSo much of your being is still back there .\nThe evolution of the world since the ancient times is neither acknowledged nor accommodated in any way .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soul remembrance is honoured or exploited .\nIf it is exploited , which is so very tempting , the life empties out of meaning and value and becomes false and repulsive .\nIf it is honoured , the expanded faculties on tap become revitalised and find a fresh relevance .\nAs the Divine Feminine reveals what we need to know and draws us to our utmost capacity , it is with an unfallen grace of sensing directly into the deepest parts of people and all they can become in the ancient future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inside Degrees Reconnecting to the original , intentional sacred energy of your life is the path to satisfaction , contentment , and peace in the storm we are entering .\nI work with people directly to help them see how to reenergize and

misattributed to Chinese philosopher Confucius it is an important statement about how your mind is corralled into bondage not by language but by imagery .\nGiven what we all here know about the occult and esoteric foundations of the political structures that govern the majority of the world , if you were to expand upon the above statement it might read something like this\u2026 But what does it mean to \u2018 rule the world ?\n\u2019 Or to \u2018 rule you , \u2019 for that matter ?\nWhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world \u2019 is to have control over the human domain of this world , which is impossible because \u2018 the world \u2019 is really just billions of autonomous humans doing whatever it is they are compelled to do by their traumatized and broken psyches .\nNow , I know that guys Yuval Noah Harari have a very public transhumanistic wet dream of using \u2018 science \u2019 to convert all autonomous beings into automatons , but that has yet to come to pass , so at present we \u2019 re still free to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rule the mind \u2019 makes a lot more sense , because authoritarian control is only possible when individuals , consciously or unconsciously , obediently comply or fearfully acquiesce to whatever the rules they have in their minds .\nAnd the freedom you experience in your life is the direct product of the rules you have in your mind , whether they were created by yourself or by someone outside of you .\nBut what \u2019 s really important here is what they have in your mind .\nAnd how it got there .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is to replace it all with ideas that give you back a slice of power and authority in your own life .\nBut the mind has levels , and below the surface , below the parts you \u2019 re consciously aware of , is where the signs and symbols have influence over you , which is what I want to discuss today .\n\u201c Just below the level of the conscious mind lies the mighty world of the subconscious , where the vast majority of our behaviours , thoughts , actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base of an iceberg , the tip being the conscious mind , the subconscious is the \u2018 driver \u2019 of the vehicle and is a place of shadows and darkness , buried experiences and embedded patterns , old beliefs and fears and all sorts of programming that has built up over the years , often at the hands of external influences like parents , peers , teachers , religious and political figures and cultural beliefs .\nWhere the conscious mind makes plans , the subconscious mind often derails those plans because of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are there .\nSo , it makes sense that most of who we believe ourselves to be is not even who we really are.\n\u201d ~Marie Jones Most people would like to believe that their behavior is organic , that they are living intentional lives , yet most people are locked in cycles of self-sabotage and self-defeating behavior , perfectly exemplifying the idea that something other than the conscious mind is driving their behavior .\nAnd this is the crux , the lynch pin .\nWe \u2019 re all under the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us have little to no awareness of the programs and patterns automatically running down there .\nAnd this is also the big , open secret in our world , and it \u2019 s well-known by advertisers , propagandists and social engineers .\nThey know they don \u2019 t have to tell you outright what they want you to do , or not do , with your life , because they know that they can influence your subconscious mind with signs and symbols alone .\nThat is , they influence you with imagery rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because the subconscious mind doesn \u2019 t communicate with words or language .\nIt understands feeling and emotion , which are invoked by imagery .\nHow do you feel when you see a tree vs. when you see a giant asphalt parking lot .\nDoes this affect your sense of hope and possibility ?\nIt is said that a picture is worth a thousand words , but there \u2019 s more to that .\nI say a picture is worth a single feeling , and a single feeling is worth a million thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life , determining what \u2019 s possible for you .\nWords are meaningless against action , and action is what drives your life forward , or not .\nAnd action is largely driven by what \u2019 s below the conscious mind .\nLooking even deeper , underneath the subconscious mind is what Carl Jung referred to as the collective unconscious , where a collection of imagery and shared knowledge is stored .\nThings which all of us instinctually understand and incorporate into our behavior .\nThese parts of the mind are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the conscious mind does .\nInstead , as researcher Michael Tsarion notes , the below conscious parts of the mind rely on signs and symbols because words have the shortcoming of introducing language barriers and interpretation barriers to communication .\nWhen a sign or symbol invokes a feeling , you automatically take your place amongst its imposed hierarchy , and this is especially evident in corporate symbols , which dominate our culture , spanning generations .\nTsarion \u2019 s timeless presentation , The Use of Sacred Symbolism in Modern Times , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs and symbols serve as the language of the unconscious mind , are are used ubiquitously in modern society to manipulate , influence and project authority .\nLet me ask you .\nAs a person operating in the modern world , do you ever get hungry when you see the Golden Arches as you \u2019 re driving down the highway ?\nDo you find yourself suddenly craving a hot , steamy cup of coffee when you see that weird siren figurine in Starbuck \u2019 s corporate logo ?\nWell , how do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see cheap yellow and blue Ukrainian flag replicas peppering lawns up and down the block ?\nDo you feel the call of duty to be heroic and join the collective outrage ?\nThe symbols give you a feeling , and if you \u2019 re unaware of how feeling shapes the contents of your mind , you \u2019 ll absent-mindedly create stories for yourself based on the intended feeling embedded in the symbol .\nAnd we see hundreds of symbols each and everyday .\nAs an example , an emergent symbol of late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blue .\nThis color combo has quickly become a symbol for how you can be a hero without actually doing anything heroic like actually resisting the assault on your God-given right to travel , work , freely associate , and make medical decisions for yourself .\nIt \u2019 s a very disempowering proposition .\nInstead of doing something genuinely heroic , the symbolic yellow and blue gives you the feeling of being heroic .\nFly a Ukranian flag , you \u2019 re a hero .\nWear a mask , you \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you \u2019 re told to , you \u2019 re a hero .\nJason Christoff did an excellent presentation breaking down the significance of the colors yellow and blue suddenly adorning modern culture\u2026 And what about all those celebtards doing photoshoots with one-eye covered ?\nDo you feel uneasy .\nDo you feel inferior ?\nDo you envy them , while they entrain you to worship a hidden authority ?\nJon Rappoport talks about how celebrities themselves serve as symbols for some imaginary story and ideal of what you \u2019 re supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s up to you to fill in the meaning , and if you \u2019 re not paying attention you \u2019 ll give them way to much power and meaning .\nThis really is a massive subject , but the thing I want you to take away today is that there is a form of communication in our world that is ubiquitous yet nearly completely beyond the recognition of most people .\nIn that void , that place where the symbols take franchise in your lower mind , exists a world of possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Understanding the Nature of Negative Forces", "content": "Unconscious Becoming Conscious : Understanding the Nature of Negative Forces According to Austrian metaphysician Rudolf Steiner , the task of humanity in this epoch is to comprehend the relation of good and evil ; especially , the human choice between good and evil , and the challenge of evil to make humanity more aware of spirit-consciousness .\nIn our present age , we are to experience the negative counterforces in order to move through to greater development .\nSteiner stated that the \u2018 forces of evil \u2019 exist in the world so that humanity might , at the appropriate time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spirit.\n\u2019 [ 1 ] The presence of the counterforces gives humanity an opportunity to gain insight into the human condition , as well as the life conditions in this earthly domain .\nBy having some understanding of the intention of opposing forces , a person is better prepared for continuing their own journey .\nThat is , we each can learn from our encounters with negating forces ; we can take these encounters as an opportunity to connect more strongly with our own force of will .\nIn the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocating the coming together of spiritually minded people , it is not our responsibility to be concerned with those who Steiner called the \u2018 soulless \u2019 ones .\nRather than being pulled into the influence of such people ( with their lower vibrational energies ) , it is more beneficial for a person to transform their immediate environment into a more harmonious energy .\nAnother way of saying this is that the presence of negativity is to be transmuted into that which is not negative or counterproductive .\nThis is akin to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transformatory epoch , where we shall have to face our shadows and deal with them .\nWithout this acknowledgement , and cleansing , we will be dominated by the forces of stagnation .\nLater , when this catharsis or \u2018 cleansing \u2019 has been achieved , we may collectively move into a stage of transmutation where the negative is transmuted into constructive forces .\nThe spirit of our times , therefore , is one of transmutation and transformation .\nAnd until counterforces are transmuted , there is no real or lasting transformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 is the leitmotif of our epoch , and it can not be done without passing through \u2018 the valley of the shadow of death ; \u2019 [ 3 ] experiencing and , above all , understanding both the forces of negation and those of development .\nAs author Terry Broadman writes : By casting light upon those forces that oppose human freedom , we may also see that , somewhat paradoxically , it is these same forces that make freedom possible .\nAnd yet , we need to gain this realization so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against .\nEntropic counterforces attempt to control and manage human thinking and cultural narratives through arid materialism \u2013 the forces of limitation , indifference , rational logic , and consumption , for example .\nSuch arid forces seek to constrain and contain human thinking by limiting it to the physical domain .\nThat is , by negation and denial of the metaphysical background to life ; a worldview that recognises no spirit-consciousness or genuine inspiration from beyond the material realm .\nIt can be said that such counter-evolutionary forces wish to ensure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 lower ego ; \u2019 that is , our base level \u2018 everyday \u2019 selves , ruled by passions , possessions , promises , and pseudo-truths .\nWe have already seen how modern life is rife with the self-centred materialist concerned only for their physical pleasures and gains .\nThis is the false-polished underbelly of a capitalist-fed globalist agenda .\nThis is the sphere where the tightly controlled culture industry provides ultimate dissonance through glamour-distraction .\nCacophonous music , jarring rhythms , and discordant lyrics appeal to the basest impulses within the tranced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then that there is resistance to those people who wish to develop their inner senses and modes of perception .\nThe everyday environment is not conducive to the development of spirit-consciousness .\nAnd yet , it is the role of awakened individuals to assist the unconscious in becoming conscious .\nEntropic forces can be regarded as forces of hindrance .\nFor various reasons , they have not fulfilled their developmental potentials ; they have faltered in their path , and thus \u2018 fallen by the wayside.\n\u2019 And as wayside creatures , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walkers upon the path .\nIt can be said that they belong to our realm but are no longer upon our developmental path .\nSuch counterforces are not creative ; that is , they are not a creative principle in the universe , and so they need to make use of \u2013 or usurp \u2013 existing impulses to be able to act in the physical world .\nSuch forces operate by distorting , and demonising , other processes and/or vessels in order to function .\nWe need to be aware of those beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc , that show a deliberate antipathy and hostility towards aspects of spirit-consciousness and the metaphysical .\nThese may be collective , and/or concealed , forces aiming to divert humanity \u2019 s path of growth .\nThe materialistic route is a caricature of what now needs to be the human being \u2019 s present state .\nTotal materialization , including the digital-virtual domains ( such as the Metaverse ) represent a paralysis of growth in spirit-consciousness .\nA total materialization of human consciousness is taking place across the world and is especially dominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life has been turned upon itself to become a parody .\nNothing can be taken at face value for the outer expressions have become corrupted .\nPseudo-truths are the caricature of relative truths ; deep fakes are the travesty of genuine selves ; and the lines between knowing and unknowing have been deliberately smeared .\nThe outer life , on its own , exists as a tarnished kingdom .\nThe only thing to do is to extract oneself from this polluting sphere and to re-wire one \u2019 s alignments , attachments , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human being \u2019 s inner authority was undermined by subjugating it to exterior bodies of authority \u2013 such as institutionalized religions .\nWhen the masses moved out of illiteracy and became educated enough to read , research , and learn for themselves , the exterior forms of authority shifted from the sacred to the secular .\nSecular institutions came to regulate social norms , thinking patterns , and modes of accepted behaviour .\nIn present times , as conscious awareness and perceptive understanding expands rapidly , the exterior bodies of authority are attempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our bodies and minds \u2013 what I have referred to as the new forms of biopower .\nThese interventions into the physical integrity of the human being have serious consequences for the natural expression of spirit-consciousness .\nIf the human vessel is unbalanced , or bio-chemically \u2013 or even genetically \u2013 interfered with , then the incarnated spirit-consciousness will have trouble in manifesting within the physical .\nThis intervention can be taken to the extreme through advancements in the biological-genetic sciences .\nThe process of human cloning is a further step in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cloned , then it is basically manufactured \u2013 it has not been brought into life through an organic birthing process ( regardless of how the fertilized egg was delivered into the female body ) .\nIn a metaphysical sense , it can be said that the physical body is not capable of receiving spirit-consciousness for it is not vibrationally aligned .\nIt is an empty vessel , in a spiritual sense .\nFrom this , it may be inferred that other entities or forces could inhabit such a physical vessel .\nWhy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automation , the techno-hybrid , the slicing and dicing with DNA and human genetics ?\nIn this , there is a shift toward splintering the human being from its metaphysical origins and from the domain of spirit .\nIf anything , this is the definition of evil \u2013 the isolation of the physical from its metaphysical source .\nThe counter-developmental forces are acting against the human mind ( psyche ) , the heart ( emotions ) , and the body ( will ) .\nThese three aspects can be related to imagination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three aspects have been targets for manipulation for quite some time .\nIn our current age , the imagination is targeted through the media , video games , propaganda , digital life , and augmented reality , for example .\nThe faculties of inspiration are being distorted through a controlled culture-industry ( music , literature , art ) .\nAnd the intuition is deadened through a weakening of the human will as well as interventions and violations against the physical body .\nAll these forces aim to press down upon the human being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in materiality whilst bringing forth more animalistic , or primitive drives .\nHow much more difficult it is for spirit-consciousness to come into a life experience , only to find that everything is subordinated to a material perspective \u2013 a world that is almost oblivious to the reality of the spirit .\nThe more a person comes under the powers of this world , under the laws set within this materiality , the less a person can act from an inner place of personal and spiritual will .\nA human being can no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are wholly invested in a consensus reality that is averse to metaphysical truths .\nAs Christ famously stated : \u2018 My Kingdom is not of this world.\n\u2019 ( John 18:36 ) Although not of this world , it must work in this world .\nOur point of interaction \u2013 participation and action \u2013 are within this world , yet our foundation does not originate from within this world .\nAnd this combination , this merger , is what creates a strength to be in this world and not to be worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit-consciousness is a fusion \u2013 and the human being is the vessel ( the receptor as well as the carrier ) .\nBeing the carrier for that which is also beyond the physical means also that the person needs to strengthen their interior world \u2013 their inner environment .\nA fully exteriorized person is too much attached with events and influences of the material world , and this can become a hindrance .\nThere needs to be enough capacity within each person to exercise internal creative imaginations so that received inspirations have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to gestate before outward expression .\nA \u2018 new world \u2019 can come into being , yet it must come through the human being and not to be forced upon it .\nThis is why it is said that a new world is birthed rather than built .\nThe outer actions may be that of building , yet the initial impulses are birthed from within .\nIt is in this way that metaphysical influences can enter into the domain of the physical \u2013 through receptive individuals .\nThe act of transmuting counteractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifts from a place of outward dominance , under the sway of external influences , and into spaces of inward receptivity to inspirational impulses .\nIn this , it can be said that the transformative process is one of the unconscious becoming conscious .\nKingsley L.

Lions", "content": "How to Transform Lambs into Lions \u201c Rise and rise again , until lambs become lions.\n\u201d Step 1 . )\nRealize that imagination is superior to reason : Before transformation , before self-empowerment , even before courage , there must be imagination .\nIf you can not even think outside your tiny lamb \u2019 s box , how will you ever be able to transform yourself into a lion powerful enough to trample it ?\nThus , imagination is foremost .\nIt is even more important than reason .\nBecause reason is telling you that you \u2019 re just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamb world with mighty wolf laws keeping you in check , docile , and immure .\nSo , you will have to sacrifice reason to imagination in order to gain the wherewithal to challenge the system .\nMost of which is religious smoke and mirrors , a political song and dance , and merely a cultural cartoon playing itself out in your brain .\nYou must be able to transcend the box that has you thinking like a lamb before you can gain the courage to crush it .\nMind must come before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a delicate epistemological balancing act , a precarious existential highwire show , an intellectually Herculean task requiring Promethean audacity .\nAnd it is one that you will probably fail at .\nThis is because cognitive dissonance itself will be your greatest enemy .\nWhich means you will be your greatest enemy .\nTherefore , the most important part of realizing that imagination is superior to reason is understanding the importance of staying ahead of the curve of your own human conditioning .\nIn short : it means getting out of\u2014and then staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require putting your Ego on a leash .\nWhich will require resurrecting the only thing that can keep it on a leash : your Soul .\nStep 2 . )\nTake a leap of courage out of faith : After you \u2019 ve managed to think outside your tiny lamb \u2019 s box through the power of imagination , it \u2019 s time to crawl out of it .\nBut how do you do that ?\nThe simple answer is courage .\nIn particular : a leap of courage .\nIn more particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith ( rigid certainty ) and into fortitude ( flexible curiosity ) .\nBut first , we need some context .\nWhat exactly is it that \u2019 s buttressing your lamb \u2019 s faith ?\nWhat is it in particular that \u2019 s propping up your lamb \u2019 s rigid certainty ?\nWhat is it precisely that is keeping you conditioned , indoctrinated , and/or brainwashed into believing a certain way ?\nPut simply : it \u2019 s the pettiness of your ego .\nPut a bit more complexly : it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the world .\nPut concisely : It \u2019 s the socially constructed part of you that you have subconsciously used as an identity to engage with reality .\nBut what happens when\u2014having used the power of imagination over reason\u2014you finally realize that this culturally conditioned aspect of you is limiting you and keeping you inside the box ?\nWhat happens when you finally see how it is the culturally constructed ego that is keeping you meek , weak , and courage-less in your lamb-hood ?\nWhat happens when you finally understand what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lion ?\nNow enter Ego Death .\nMost people falsely assume that Ego Death means killing off the ego .\nThis is not what it means .\nEgo Death means annihilation .\nThe ego is annihilated in the \u201c cocoon \u201d of \u201c death \u201d in order to emerge as the \u201c butterfly \u201d of the soul .\nEgo Death is more of a rebirth than it is a destruction .\nThe metaphor of the cocoon is trite but important .\nThe invulnerable ego must die in order for the vulnerable soul to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity to be born .\nAttachment must die for detachment to be born .\nRigidity must die for flexibility to be born .\nTaking a leap of courage out of your tiny lamb \u2019 s box ( faith ) must take place in order to cure the disease of certainty with the medicine of curiosity .\nWithout curiosity there is no openness to new knowledge , there is no flexibility of thought , there is no plasticity of spirit .\nWithout curiosity there is no way you will be able to integrate your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step in how to transform a lamb into a lion .\nWith your curiosity in front of you and your certainty behind you , you now have the existential plasticity to face the Underdark of Yourself .\nYour certainty is shattered glass behind you as you walk \u201c barefoot \u201d into yourself .\nYour curiosity is a blazing light inside you , shining into the darkness , making the darkest parts of yourself light up into glorious conscious awareness .\nHaving been hidden , hushed , and repressed for so long , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce revivification .\nThey laugh with thirsty desire .\nThey sing with jovial howls .\nThey are finally seen , felt , heard .\nAnd they are hungry .\nTheir appetite slams together inside you , a soul-quaking shockwave , shaking you to the core .\nThey join forces to become the shadow aspect , the inner beast reborn , primal darkness incarnate .\nIt rises up inside you , an alien demon taking over , seemingly separate at first , but finally coalescent .\nIn the end , you realize that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have ever hoped to be .\nMore real .\nMore primal .\nMore vital to becoming the best version of yourself than anything that could have come before .\nIt transforms your delicate sheepishness into fierce lionheartedness .\nYou feel more alive than ever .\nA sacred alignment manifests .\nThe pieces of your puzzled self-paradoxically click together .\nYou feel whole , actualized , aware .\nMost of all , you feel hungry , thirsty , ravenous , voracious .\nYour lion appetite swallows your tiny sheep stomach whole .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well .\nNow that your shadow has been aligned with your light , it \u2019 s time to transform fear into fuel for the fire to come .\nIt \u2019 s time to grow those teeth and sharpen those claws .\nIt \u2019 s time for fierceness over pettiness , absolute vulnerability over resolute invulnerability , and courage over cowardice .\nIn short : it \u2019 s time to start living a courage-based lifestyle rather than a fear-based one .\nYou do this by first honoring what came before .\nHonor the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Soul .\nHonor the death of your naivete and its painful transformation into shadow alignment .\nHonor the death of your sheepishness and its painful transformation into lionheartedness .\nSecond , you must transform your roots into a crown .\nYou must force your mortal coil into a vital halo .\nYou must dig deep into the humus of your humanity and strike the primal lodestone .\nFrom the spark will come an energy that will sharpen your teeth , claws , and soul .\nIt will propel you into animal greatness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humility , and humor .\nBut it will also teach you fierceness , courage , and audaciousness .\nIt \u2019 s finally time to crush that outdated sheep \u2019 s box with your mighty lion \u2019 s paw .\n5 . )\nDraw a line in the sand ; challenge all comers : How does a lamb transform fear into courage and become the brave lion who is capable of keeping wolves in check ?\nThe lamb must first put itself in check by questioning why it believes what it believes about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must ask itself : Are my beliefs culturally conditioned by a sick society ?\nHave I been brainwashed into believing a certain way by a religious or political party ?\nDo I just blindly obey out of fear of losing my comfort , safety and security ?\nAnd , most importantly of all , once I realize I \u2019 ve been mistaken , will I cease being mistaken or will I cease being honest ?\nIt \u2019 s a tricky tightrope between fear and courage .\nThe way toward freedom is not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably why there are so few lions among men .\nA lamb that can manage to question its fear-based lifestyle\u2014a lifestyle built upon blind obedience , addiction to comfort , and reliance on wolves to keep them \u201c safe \u201d \u2014is a lamb that has the potential to become a courageous lion .\nIf a lamb can manage to become a courageous lion , then the next step is to reveal its courage to the world .\nThis requires a complex recipe of trust , vulnerability , adaptability , and risk-taking .\nLions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They embrace that risk with honor and courage .\nWhere sheep fear making waves , lions relish in it .\nFor they realize that sometimes you must rock the boat to keep it afloat .\nLife is too short to be a bystander .\nLions take a stand .\nThey draw a line in the sand .\nThey bare their teeth .\nThey show their claws .\nThey crush ultimatums through the power of their own moral autonomy .\nThey ruthlessly reveal why the buck must stop here .\nLions are all too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself is troubled .\nThey must .\nTrouble be damned !\nWhen society fails to regulate itself , the lionhearted must regulate society .\nThis has always been the task of lions .\nGary \u2018 Z \u2019 McGee , a former Navy Intelligence Specialist turned philosopher , is the author of Birthday Suit of God and The Looking Glass Man .\nHis works are inspired by

accept physical events at face value .\nInfluences come to us upon many varied levels , and the visible , physical carrier or medium is the most superficial form .\nAll of life is a play of forces ; we may call these \u2018 universal forces \u2019 for they act both within and beyond the physical .\nWe have become accustomed to giving personal forms to many of these forces , and we believe that we are independent and free from their influence .\nThe Greek-Armenian mystic G.I .\nGurdjieff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 48 laws , of which they are mostly unaware or ignorant of .\nThis is a very precise number , and it is not the numbers \u2013 the quantity \u2013 or the specifics that I wish to focus on here , but the quality .\nIt may be necessary to have a \u2018 feeling \u2019 for the forces of influence that populate our lives in the physical domain .\nMost people , most of the time , are not aware of the forces acting upon them ; and this is a natural condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sea of vibrations \u2013 thoughts , suggestions , influences , etc \u2013 and we are barely aware of which ones belong to us and which we take to be our own .\nLet us take a common example as an illustration : information .\nWhen a person receives information , the general response is to consider the likelihood of that information in relation to their belief sets and range of accumulated opinions .\nThe person then makes a response regarding whether the information is \u2018 true \u2019 or \u2018 false.\n\u2019 Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard the relationship of the communication .\nWe have to also consider the background to the source of the information : what is the source ; do they have an agenda ; are they relaying the information from another source ; what is the motivation ; what are the expected outcomes ?\nAnd more .\nWe may also need to ask ourselves whether the medium of transmission is reliable or corrupted .\nIf a technological medium is used , are there subtle subliminal messages and signalling within the transmission ?\nAre certain frequencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is the receiver being discreetly nudged into making desired outcomes ?\nIf this is a face-to-face communication , we may also ask whether the speaker is using specific techniques of language coercion , such as neuro-linguistic programming ?\nThese are just a very few of the potential influences that could be used in the physical communication of information .\nAnd yet , these are still those forces of influence that are limited to the physical range .\nIt is good to be mindful that non-physical forces compete for power the same as familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us in everyday life are the motivations behind the impulses that surface within the physical .\nThe human life experience conditions us to view and respond to outward aspects whilst remaining unaware of those things acting behind the veil \u2013 or behind the scenes .\nThis disjuncture between origin and target is more than a gap ; it is a gulf .\nAs the Indian philosopher Sri Aurobindo remarked in relation to the hidden forces of life , \u2018 the only way out is through the descent of a consciousness which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is greater than they are and can compel them either to change or disappear.\n\u2019 [ 1 ] Aurobindo is saying here that the \u2018 way out \u2019 is not to attempt to fight or meet these forces head on but to align with a degree of consciousness that is greater , or vibrationally beyond , the level of those forces .\nRather than struggle with them , we are to resonate to a different vibrational alignment that takes us out of their spectrum of influence .\nWithin the general scheme of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments ; they are moved around like puppets , suspecting nothing .\nThey live predictable lives ; that is , lives that can be predicted as they move within known patterns .\nOften , these patterns are what have been programmed into the collective mass society .\nAs soon as a person shifts to an inner-directed life , they begin to move away from predictability .\nThat is , they move \u2018 off-pattern , \u2019 and this is not well-liked by those of the governing forces .\nThe spirit-consciousness can override the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is being increasingly pulled into a physical-material direction \u2013 a pathway to both outer as well as inner automation .\nStability is based on a repetition of vibrations and frequencies that our being becomes accustomed to .\nA person gets entrained through vibrational alignment into a mode of stability .\nThe question we should be asking ourselves is : what type of frequencies are we aligning with ?\nA great deal of stability within the physical realm is of a \u2018 lower order \u2019 type , based on more limited patterns .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ this talk about vibrations \u2013 isn \u2019 t that new age nonsense ?\nIt all depends on how such information is presented and conveyed .\nA truth can easily be made into a mockery if handled incorrectly .\nThe Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla famously said : \u2018 If you want to find the secrets of the universe , think in terms of energy , frequency and vibration.\n\u2019 Again , going back to G.I .\nGurdjieff , who stated : It is interesting here that Gurdjieff speaks about the \u2018 discontinuity of vibrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases ) and retardations ( delays ) .\nThere is not a uniformity in the influence of vibrations .\nThe \u2018 energetic background \u2019 of life , so to speak , moves through these periodic shifts .\nThis can be seen as a macro influence upon human life .\nIn such times , we may feel irritable , restless , frustrated , or more .\nPhilosopher J.G .\nBennett referred to this when he wrote : These impersonal forces that influence the world , and our states of being , we know only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceive only a small degree through the lens of visible events and consequences .\nThere are forces unknown to us that are responsible for shaping our physical , psychic , and emotional environment .\nThe human being lives \u2018 constantly in the midst of a whirl of unseen mind-forces and life-forces of which we know nothing , we are not even aware of their existence.\n\u2019 [ 4 ] There are currently forces acting upon human consciousness and producing a great deal of pressure .\nWe are in need of an outlet for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our societies in uncomfortable and disagreeable ways .\nThere is now a contestation of forces that are so visible that they can no longer be denied by the aware ( or awake ) individual .\nAt the same time , a great evolutionary ( developmental ) force is pushing into the earthly domain , and there is immense resistance to this .\nThis makes the struggle \u2013 the contestation of forces \u2013 more acute , more violent , and more definitive .\nYet this very visibility of the counterforces upon the physical world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 it displays their state of desperation to come out of the shadows in this way .\nThis opens up an important path of realization for the rest of us \u2013 and possibilities too .\nEven if individual transformation is upon a small scale , there is the opportunity now for a general uplifting within collective humanity .\nAnd it is this general uplifting that will usher in the potentials and conditions for a new world to emerge .\nAgain , as Bennett says , We have arrived at an exceptional hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human awareness and perception , if only we can bypass those forces of hindrance .\nWhat we need now is inner certitude and to exercise discernment \u2013 especially when open to the forces of mass vibration .\nThe mass exhibits a different resonance than the individual .\nWhen in a group , or crowd , an individual invariably takes on the features , thoughts , and moods of others .\nIn this way , the individual can be inwardly polluted and corrupted by forces they are not aware of .\nIt is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be with , mix with , for each person is a point of reception/transmission , and we vibrationally align ( resonate ) with those we are physically close to .\nThat is why the mob can be psychologically , and behaviourally , dangerous .\nAnd this is also why we are advised to choose our friends carefully ; a lot can be said about a person according to their friends and associates .\nIt would do us well to remember that \u2018 one catches the constant contagion of all desires , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscure reactions , all the unwanted vibrations which come to us from those around us.\n\u2019 [ 6 ] Life is a continual interplay of forces , a continuous alchemy in which a person is constantly absorbing various kinds of vibration that may contain all types of possible dissonance .\nIn this , the task of the conscious and aware person is to transmute these dissonant forces so that their action and influence is disabled .\nWe can do this by grounding the vibration .\nLet us say that something , an event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has caused us frustration .\nWe refrain from responding to it by taking an inner pause , an internal step back , and we observe the discomfort .\nThis \u2018 item \u2019 is treated as an observable object with a life of its own \u2013 it is an energy form .\nAnd it needs to be allowed to dissipate rather than find an energy source to latch onto ( i.e.\n, oneself ) .\nIn this , the energy form ( the \u2018 item \u2019 ) needs to be grounded within neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to be grounded or \u2018 earthed.\n\u2019 Similarly , we earth the dissonant energy by visualizing its transference into the ground beneath us ( it doesn \u2019 t matter if you are sitting or standing ) .\nIn this way , the dissonant energy vibration is transmuted .\nThis action is the work of perceptive consciousness and does not have to be regarded as something \u2018 spiritual.\n\u2019 On the contrary , it is part of the task of the human being during its sojourn through physical life to transmute energies .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals that , according to the Mother ( Sri Aurobindo \u2019 s spiritual co-worker ) , a \u2018 minimum of general harmony \u2019 can be accomplished : It is through such Work as this that we become aware of the intervention of forces , impulses , and influences , which are non-visible to our ordinary states of consciousness , and which seek to affect physical life circumstances .\nThe forces of mass vibrational dissonance are exceptionally intense in these current times .\nIt can be said that humanity has reached a particular state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hindrance \u2019 would delight in creating divisions by dividing friendships and social alliances .\nSome divisions , however , are set to occur , for these are the breakdowns in the dysfunctional external systems that perpetuate the fractures in our societies .\nThese are such systems as politics , economy , and social trust .\nWe can expect some cracks to appear in these systems for \u2018 Nature \u2019 s Work \u2019 to operate .\nYet we can not allow these fractures to disable the human spirit \u2013 or to numb the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs stated by the Mother in the opening citation to this essay , life is mostly awash with vibrations of disorder and falsehood , in which \u2018 vibrations of Truth and Harmony are coming from the higher regions and pushing their way through the resistance.\n\u2019 We are tasked , in these times , to assist these \u2018 vibrations of Truth and Harmony \u2019 and to help them to push their way through the resistance .\nAnd in this , we are aligning with the continuation of the alchemical work by assisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lead ) into constructive forces ( the gold ) .\nAnd by doing this we shall also be assisting in the alchemical transmutation of the great treasure of the philosopher \u2019 s stone \u2013 ourselves .\nKingsley L.

.\nThe story becomes part of the zeitgeist , and mixes itself in with our collective history .\nAnother brick in the wall .\nAnd though you may try to stay focused on the things which matter in your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your adventure in this meat suit forward , you get sucked into the morass along with everyone else .\nYou make up your mind about how you feel about it .\nYou parrot your favorite pundits .\nYou become an expert .\nBut it is distressing , concerning , and disheartening .\nYour mood takes a dive .\nThe already dense energy of the times becomes even heavier .\nThough you may battle against it , you \u2019 re taken captive and the gloom of the moment exacerbates .\nYour emotional body screams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your physical body feels the compounding stress .\nYou engage your

\u2018 stay positive , \u2019 or at least to appear to be doing so .\nBut with each passing wave your spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the last , and the effects accumulative .\nThis is the 3D reality of the spiritual war for most people .\nMost people are not shamans .\nThey are not sages or gurus or ascetics .\nThey are not masters or spiritual leaders or even thought leaders .\nThey are firmly entrenched in the 3D world .\nPaying bills , raising children , holding onto relationships , and working like hell to make it all work .\nWhile also and forever holding onto the dream of success .\nThe dream of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dream of experiencing the freedom they see paraded and dangled before their hungry eyes in advertisements , glamour mags , and Netflix .\nThey \u2019 re

profoundly sick society ?\nWhat happens when the \u201c order of things \u201d is unhealthy ?\nWhat happens when the machinery of culture is outdated and found wanting ?\nMore importantly , what happens when you rebel against it ?\nThe answer : you become a healthy glitch .\nMoreso , you become a necessary glitch , a vital glitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a healthier one .\nHere are a few next-level strategies for becoming a necessary glitch in the unnecessary Matrix\u2026 The trickster is a double-edged sword .\nHe cuts himself even as he cuts the world .\nHe cuts his own ego first , but , knowing that he is the world and the world is him , he also cuts the world .\nHe battles against Certainty to keep Curiosity at the forefront of the human condition .\nYour inner trickster understands that the cure for certainty is curiosity .\nThe cure for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure for seriousness is playfulness .\nAnd so , he plays with the outdated constructs of the sick culture that surrounds him like a kid plays with toys .\nHe wrecks them against each other , and thereby reveals their inherent corruption .\nTapping your inner trickster will give you the courage you will need to go beyond good and evil , beyond outdated notions of \u201c truth , \u201d and beyond cultural modes of rightdoing and wrongdoing .\nIt will propel you into playful , non-serious , and honest detachment .\nIt @ @ @ @ @

push envelopes , and stretch comfort zones .\nThe best way to change culture is to create it .\nAnd the best way to create it is to become a bridge between worlds .\nAs a bridge between worlds , you

and the banal , between wildness and domestication , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you create a sacred space where human evolution can unfold in a healthy way .\nBridge the gap to break unhealthy myths .\nBridge the gap to create new , healthier myths that are open-ended and not hung-up on themselves .\nBridge the gap to point out the flaws in the cartoon society .\nBridge the gap to rebel and to reveal an

act as \u2018 alarm clocks \u2019 for others .\nWhat may be the real issue here is not so much the chaos unfolding in the physical world but rather that not enough people are enabling an appropriate resonance to take root and to become established within humanity .\nThe real \u2018 apocalyptic \u2019 scenario is the breaking down of old ways and the bringing in of new resonant alignments .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great change and shifts come about through breakdown , and what appears as destruction .\nThat is , beginnings need a new space from which to emerge , both physically and energetically .\nThe current reality of the modern world has much within it to overload the human senses .\nThere are many factors that contribute to vibrational dissonance , and this seems to be increasing , not lessening .\nPart of this is related to our advancing technologies , especially our digital devices and communications infrastructure .\nOther aspects are related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and collective state of psychological ( dis ) equilibrium .\nBoth elements \u2013 the technological and the psychological \u2013 are interrelated and affect one another .\nMoreover , there are also deliberate human strategies to maintain this dissonance and state of fragmentation as a means to manipulate , control , divide , and box up each individual inside their own conscious experience .\nIf placed into specific labelled boxes , then human thinking patterns and fields of consciousness will become artificially restricted .\nUnfortunately , many people have become so used to experiencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our restrictive thinking patterns , that then go on to form belief systems , intellectual structures , and programmed perspectives .\nWe are literally living out of boxes \u2013 psychologically homeless \u2013 with our genuine freedoms curtailed .\nWe are so used to projecting our psychological attachments upon so many unnecessary things , which we then get entangled with .\nIt is understandable that there is a confusion around the concept of resonance .\nThere is a popular notion that resonance is something to be \u2018 raised \u2019 through certain actions such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be little more than sugar-coating \u2013 a \u2018 band-aid treatment \u2019 as it is called .\n[ 1 ] That is , people end up masking the issue without actually getting to the root of it .\nAnd this appears to be fast becoming a default setting in modern life .\nBy seeking out positive thinking \u2018 feel good \u2019 type of practices , this is like using medication to mask the pain without finding out the root cause .\nAnd in the end , it may serve as a distraction rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attachment to the old patterns and feel-good factors may function more as a delay rather than as a remedy .\nPositive thought is not a bad thing , but it should not detract from the understanding that a person is , relatively speaking , already imbued with their own potentials .\nThe misunderstanding here is that people are pushing to \u2018 raise something.\n\u2019 But in this , people often remain clinging to all the old baggage of seeking salvation away from the circumstances of everyday life .\nAnd this can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , to disconnect , from their unhealthy entanglements .\nNatural resonance is more a question of being receptive rather than pushing to \u2018 raise \u2019 something .\nThat is , we are being reminded to refine what we already are \u2013 there is no need to feel compelled to go anywhere \u2018 higher.\n\u2019 A person \u2019 s energetic state and resonance is relational to how they feel within .\nAs such , it is strongly connected to our mental and emotional states .\nAs it is now broadly recognized , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are easily influenced and manipulated to give away our inner authority onto external structures and supports .\nThe more things that we link our energy up to , the more we can be influenced .\nIn this , we can be giving our energies away without a reciprocal exchange .\nThis can be through linking up to other people , as well as with possessions , ideas , desires , etc .\nThe more we send out our vibrational tentacles , the more we are liable , often unknowingly , to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe easily forget to \u2018 draw back the links , \u2019 and to reevaluate our psychological , emotional , and physical attachments .\nIt is often through our own unawareness that we block or distort our natural resonance \u2013 our flow .\nJust as we arrange our house to the way we like it , to give us the energetic feel that makes it right for us , so too should we arrange our life , our connections and relations , in a way that harmonizes with us .\nHumans have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high degree of self-awareness .\nYet because of this , we often over-complicate matters ; whereby animals , on the other hand , are much more instinctive and responsive to fields of energy .\nIt may be good to remind ourselves that we each have the capacity to literally re-wire our internal connections that then will manifest in our external relations .\nIn the end , human survival is dependent upon the connections we make to the world around us .\nWe can not evolve as a species cut off from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that humanity is being nudged down its rabbit hole , but all alone .\nWe have lost part of our essential connection in how we resonate to the planet , the animal kingdom , with the ecosystem , and within the larger cosmos .\nWe are severing our resonance with the very environment that sustains and nourishes us \u2013 it is like we are peeing in our own bathwater .\nIn the end , any imbalance will cause our species the greatest upset .\nThe planet , and its environment , can always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural resonance .\nOn the other hand , humanity has placed this disequilibrium and off-kilter resonance upon themselves \u2013 or else allowed others to place it .\nYet now is the moment to step away from these pathways of dissonance and disequilibrium and to allow for the establishment of a new foundation .\nBeginnings need a new space from which to emerge , both physically and energetically .\nThe path of self-development \u2013 \u2018 a process of human becoming \u2019 \u2013 is something that generally goes against all that we have been taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social programming and conditioning that we were brought up within .\nWe may even be asking ourselves : \u2018 why be the foundation in which a new world needs to be built upon when I have a hard enough time dealing with my regular everyday life ?\n\u2019 It may also sound like pseudo-science when it is said that the creation of new neural pathways in the human brain can allow for a new resonance pattern .\nYet this is how new thinking operates \u2013 it starts to establish new patterns of neuronal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial re-wiring should occur \u2013 in our own internal workings , not out there in the physical world .\nBesides , what happens within will also be reflected without : this is also part of the relational aspect of energy .\nIt is about reprogramming ourselves first , before we rush off trying to reorder and reorganize the world around us .\nWe need to take time to reassess and to question ourselves and the world we perceive .\nIt is time for us to take a good , deep look at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking ) has seemingly got itself embedded into a \u2018 vicious cycle , \u2019 or loop pattern .\nOur socializing processes literally hypnotize us , and we create a myriad of manifestos and ideologies to keep us entertained ( or transfixed ) .\nWe easily become trapped within our own rankings and system of hierarchies , and little realize how much we smother ourselves .\nAfter putting on so many outer layers ( like overcoats ) \u2013 socially , psychologically , emotionally , etc .\n\u2013 it is now time to start stripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life experience as the \u2018 game of life , \u2019 yet we often miss the point in that games are meant to be played \u2013 and we need to learn how to play our \u2018 selves.\n\u2019 In playing our Self , we also should be playing our own truths .\nYet most of the time we end up playing someone else \u2019 s truths .\nWe need to ground ourselves first .\nOtherwise , we are liable to be swung around by the events , influences , and manipulations of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ourselves where we may find our truths or not , for then we are already creating limitations and confinements .\nThe barriers , blockages , and illusions that we may have built up around us need now to be dropped .\nAfter all , life often has a way of circumnavigating our expectations and presenting us with incredible , spontaneous opportunities .\nLet us just say that it is timely to be now taking time out to re-align with our \u2018 home resonance \u2019 and to root this .\nIt is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refocus , to readjust , and realign .\nTo find our balance \u2013 our resonance/equilibrium \u2013 is not rocket-science , as they say .\nIf a person wishes to use certain practices/tools to re-sync back up , then this is fine \u2013 so long as they realize that these are tools and not the thing itself .\nOf course , it can be said that humans have always used tools throughout their history ; tools have helped us navigate through the material world and to mediate our experiences .\nThe danger here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-identify with them ; when we say , \u2018 my practice or meditation is more spiritual , more aligned than yours , \u2019 then such an attitude as this helps no one .\nReadjustment is not a forced process ; it is a natural re-alignment and , as such , should be as normal as possible and not strained .\nOur tools and practices should not end up getting in the way by becoming our crutches .\nOnce the \u2018 work is done , \u2019 so to speak , we can put them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us .\nAfter all , we wouldn \u2019 t continue to use a hammer if it is not needed , for it would only damage the wood .\nUltimately , those structures and groupings that favour separation , division , and control will fall for they are not sustainable or relatable to natural law .\nIf the energy upon this planet increasingly shifts to one of unity and togetherness , then this will attract others into this alignment .\nPeople , structures , and groupings that have previously favoured separation and discord may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent energies upon the planet shift .\nNot only is this scenario possible , it may even be likely , due to cosmic factors which then influence planetary ones .\nThis realignment upon the planet may be chaotic initially , yet such chaos generally has a function .\nAnd let us also be honest : this re-wiring for the foundations of a new world will not attract everyone .\nNot everyone is ready for it yet .\nThere are a great many people not yet actively seeking this type of information or understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be forced \u2013 that is the nature of natural resonance .\nYet if enough people start to manifest a new harmonic resonance , the collective instrument that is humanity can be re-tuned .\nAfter all , it only takes a few musicians to hear the new pitch in order to guide the orchestra .", "author": "WakingTimes", "url":

West on I-10 towards Fort Stockton , Texas , on my way to Big Bend National Park .\nBig Bend has long been my happy place .\nMy sanctuary .\nIt \u2019 s the one place in this world I know of where you can pitch a tent 10 miles from anyone , with nothing but the big bright open sky above to keep you company .\nWhere you can sit alone with the universe and get a clear picture of what \u2019 s really happening inside yourself .\nListening to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George W. Bush \u2019 s neocon war hawks was making a live statement .\nIt was Richard something or other , I forget his name , but I \u2019 m certain he \u2019 s accustomed to being called Dick .\nAnd no , not Cheney .\nNot that Dick .\nDifferent Dick .\nOh wait , I just remembered .\nHolbrooke .\nRichard Holbrooke , that \u2019 s right .\nStill a Dick , though .\nAnyhow , he said that the bombing of Iraq had just begun , and that our fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorism , and the evil-loving-freedom-doers had necessarily begun .\nShock and awe , baby !\nMurica !\nOut there in the barrens of West Texas I couldn \u2019 t be farther from the war , yet I felt like part of the team .\nThe winning team .\nThe good guys .\nAnd after watching on live TV as the South Tower was smashed with a 767 , ( and 10,000 replays of it ) , the prospect of getting revenge felt right for the times .\n\u201c Fuck \u2019 em .\nSend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age\u2026 let God sort \u2019 em out.\n\u201d I had been duly indoctrinated .\nI was walking , talking proof that the system excels above all else at capturing minds and holding them in bondage from cradle to grave .\nA product of my generation .\nA real kool-aid drinker was I .\nBut oh , how things change .\nWithin a year I stumbled upon the first wave of 9/11 truth information , and lo and behold , it made a hell of a lot of sense to me .\nAnd when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official story , I had no choice but to honor that common sense , and I began to ask questions .\nI \u2019 m a smart guy .\nReal smart .\nI \u2019 m also a rebel , and I \u2019 ve never had a proclivity to trust so-called authority figures .\nEspecially ones whom profit from murder , and so I went deep to find out what the hell was really happening in our world .\nNearly twenty years later I can say that I \u2019 ve been down most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the research , and I \u2019 ve decided where I stand , which is where I now watch the world from .\nAnd given the events of the last few years , it \u2019 s a strange place to be .\nTo stand in truth , with the expectancy that others will see the light and join you , yet all the while the lies grow more brazen and obvious .\nWhen will the tide turn ?\nI \u2019 ve shifted the focus of my work from documenting the situation to assisting others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in times of such pervasive bullshit , and this new line of work is helping me to see something very important that you might do well to consider .\nWhen I say I \u2019 ve done the research , what I really mean is that I \u2019 ve spent countless hours in books and on the internet consuming as much information as I could stomach on what the the agenda of the emerging NWO might be .\nIt \u2019 s a painful experience to have all of your illusions shattered , one after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI recall around 2006 , when all of it was really hitting me , it felt like I was grieving for something lost , something dead , and reflecting now I feel that this process we call \u2018 awakening \u2019 includes the well-known seven stages of grief .\nThe clients I work with are all truth seekers .\nThey are all unvaccinated .\nThey are all righteously suspicious of demons like Klaus Schwab , Bill Gates , Fauci , and Yuval Noah Harari .\nThey are all fiercely independent , sometimes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sacrifice shallow social connections and phony friendships or familial relations which don \u2019 t honor their desire to live in a world of truthfulness .\nBut most of them are also stuck , hooked on truth seeking as a form of escape from the uneasiness that comes with rejecting the notion that ignorance is bliss .\nMost of them haven \u2019 t reached the acceptance stage in processing their grief for a world gone mad .\nThey are stuck in depression or anger , or still hoping to bargain their way out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone they meet that the powers that be aren \u2019 t as virtuous as their PR firms portray them to be .\nAnd here is the truth seeker \u2019 s dilemma .\nHow do you live in truth in a world of lies without going crazy and without allowing the energy of your life to be to be hijacked and misdirected onto things which you have no control over ?\nThere is a \u2018 stuckness \u2019 that often comes with being a truth seeker .\nIt \u2019 s frustrating and debilitating , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything to do with fear , because , let \u2019 s face it , the things being brought out into the open are deeply disturbing and downright horrifying , at least for people like you and I.\nIt \u2019 s about fight , flight , or freeze , and so many good people , perhaps even yourself , are frozen , because there \u2019 s no place to flee to , and there \u2019 s really no effective way for most people to fight this .\nSo we get stuck .\nAnd the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it creates an emotional storm within yourself , an emotional avalanche , if you will , triggering a deep and very real need to escape .\nIt causes inaction , which is the killer of confidence .\nIn our quest for more knowledge we seek the comfort and sense of security we think we can find by knowing that we \u2019 re not alone .\nAnd we \u2019 re not alone , but knowing that doesn \u2019 t seem to be enough .\nSome of us attempt to escape the emotional storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drugs , which of course only exacerbates the depression and sidelines us in weakness and impotency .\nMost simply stay frozen in the echo chambers and rabbit holes on an endless quest for that one piece of knowledge that will free us all .\nAnd the longer we stay there , the stronger grip the darkness has on us .\nIt \u2019 s another form of escape , which is not at all the same things as taking flight .\nIt becomes just another distraction in our lives .\nA go-to time-killer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear while simultaneously amplifying the fear .\nA form of self-medication which only exacerbates the anxiety , as most self-medications do .\nIt \u2019 s very challenging to consume such hard truths without being weighed down by the heaviness of it all .\nThere \u2019 s a gravity to the evil encircling us that does a fantastic job of preventing your spirit from reaching orbit .\nThis is why I often speak about the spiritual war and the importance of winning it in your day-to-day , moment-to-moment existence .\nYet the thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet and talk with all have one thing in common .\nThey all want to have a positive impact on people and on this world .\nParadoxically , however , their endless quest for more truth is the thing preventing them from becoming the kind of person whom can actually have a positive impact on others , because it keeps them anchored in a very dense , very constrictive state of consciousness .\nThe restrictive consciousness of fear .\nAnd again , it causes them to freeze in inaction , which increases their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all .\nIt \u2019 s nearly impossible to be an effective agent of change when you \u2019 re living in the same levels of consciousness you \u2019 re trying to evade .\nI \u2019 m certain Einstein told us this already .\nSo , the dilemma really is about how to be in this world and not of it , so that you can watch the shitshow with a sense of non-attachment , thereby giving yourself the freedom and space to soar above it all and actually apply your energy in service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in service of those who need you .\nIt \u2019 s about moving into and beyond the seventh stage of grief , acceptance .\nIt \u2019 s about elevating your own level of consciousness without depending on anything outside of yourself to change in your favor .\nIt \u2019 s about winning the spiritual war and escaping the purgatory of the info war .\nWhen you do escape , you \u2019 ll finally be able to live in this ignorant world of competing narratives without becoming the narratives .\nYou \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pit , giving you the precious ability to operate with spiritual sovereignty at a time when the system wants nothing more than to keep you locked down in anxiety , fear and doubt .\nYou \u2019 ll be able to pay attention without getting distracted , and you \u2019 ll be able to take action in your life , setting an example for the others .\nI know that a LOT of you out there are going through this , and this is something I work on with my clients .\nIf you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being stuck , reach out

matrix for close to two decades , the deeper intent of the non-stop media fear/stupidity/conformity blitz and the attack on the individual is really coming into full focus .\nBack in the day it never occurred to me that the entire agenda being shoved down our throats was so dependent on the individual \u2019 s unconscious drive to destroy themselves , but it \u2019 s as clear as a crisp morning dew to me now .\nThey NEED you to bench yourself .\nThey NEED you to their dirty work for them .\nThey NEED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indecision .\nThey NEED you to seek escape in whatever rabbit holes you can find .\nThey need you to feel anxious , empty , lost , alone , and depleted .\nThey NEED you to destroy yourself .\nI wrote an article a while back on that demon Zbigniev Brezynksi , who \u2019 s now transferred over to the realm of the damned .\nIn it I revisited his classic comment about controlling and killing people .\nIt tells you everything you need to know about the mindset of the ghouls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions we \u2019 ve been told are here to save us .\nI made the point that killing a million people was child \u2019 s play today .\nThat the big ballers had since 10x \u2019 d their ambitions .\nThat the stakes and the ante had risen exponentially , and that in order to achieve the moonshot they \u2019 re going for , they need now to control a billion people , while they figured out how to kill a billion people .\nOr five .\nSurely even the most committed bootlickers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u2019 s the thing , there are a lot of bootlickers out there .\nWay more than you \u2019 d think there would be , given that the national story is all about resisting taxes and tyranny .\nTo the death .\nBut the bootlickers aren \u2019 t guided by some deep personal philosophy that exalts the virtues of obedience and acquiescence .\nThey don \u2019 t stand firmly on the conviction that blind allegiance is the righteous man \u2019 s path to security and longevity .\nIt \u2019 s really about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that individuality and resistance are honorable , but chided for anything less than conformity and submission .\nTo corral people into such a moral chasm said people must be conditioned to devalue their own lives and forfeit their personal power in this world .\nAnd with so many people in this world , the conditioning has to be scalable .\nAnd the best means of scaling such conditioning is to base it on the simple principle of self-inflicted diminishment .\nWhen you kneecap yourself , they don \u2019 t have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition people to destroy themselves , and why is it such an international priority ?\nPrimarily by controlling a person \u2019 s choices and options by engineering their environment .\nLike lab rats in social experiments .\nCreate for them a cage or a maze .\nOf the matrix , as I like to call it .\nInsert a system of rewards and punishments .\nTweak their available content , and the quality and quantity of their food and drink .\nObserve their reactions and performance .\nShould they go crazy and eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trash and start over , tweaking the variables over and again until the desired outcome is achieved , whatever that may be .\nIn our case , as humans in a geopolitical/financial/scientifically materialistic rat maze , the desired result is to create a population of distracted short-term thinkers , who continually and unconsciously seek instant gratification .\nTrin them to adopt the habits , patterns of thought , and addictions to substances which contribute to the decay of their mental , physical , and spiritual health , and drive them into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bulk of the fruits of their labors on things that only deepen their addiction and dependence to that which enslaves them .\nHere \u2019 s a great example that I \u2019 m sure you \u2019 ve seen in the \u2018 news \u2019 recently .\nThe Japanese government is now encouraging young people to drink alcohol , ostensibly because the tax revenue generated by the alcohol industry is in sever decline , and the industry itself ain \u2019 t doing so well financially .\nSo , naturally , the government solution is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consume more of an addictive , self-destructive substance for the supposed economic benefit .\nAs if that makes sense .\nAnd while it may very well destroy their potential , their relationships , their families , their careers , or kill people on the highways , none of that factors in against the need for revenue .\nThe needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few , right ?\nIt \u2019 s your patriotic duty to destroy yourself .\nI talk about these issues more and more often these days because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though you are awake , that even though you know what \u2019 s in the rabbit holes and what \u2019 s coming down the pike , and even though you \u2019 re making an effort to live outside of the system in thought and deed , you \u2019 re still in the rat cage .\nYour options are still engineered , and the most self-destructive ideas , beliefs , activities , and substances are still widely available , socially acceptable , pushed on you by corporations and your peers , and are constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making faculties .\nThis is why no matter how spiritually aware you , no matter how much you know what living a clean and purposeful life means to you , no matter how much you desire to control your diet , no matter how much you revere your sobriety ( both chemical and emotional sobriety ) , you \u2019 re still operating in a dense maze of subconscious mind control programming .\nAgain , in this environment , destroying yourself is your patriotic duty .\nAnd from the top down .\nFrom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the temple to the tent city .\nFrom the bank to the bar .\nFrom the farm to the pharmacy , everyone around you is being coaxed and conditioned into believing that self-destruction is the way roll around here , and that weakness

and has tried on the lie that a little alcohol won \u2019 t hurt all that much , I \u2019 ve learned that it \u2019 s just not for me .\nWhen I \u2019 m free of alcohol my life is simply better .\nThere \u2019 s a profound sense of mental and spiritual clarity which continues to deepen with each day of sobriety .\nAs a self-mastery and self-sabotage coach I work with a lot of truth seekers .\nNow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there \u2019 s spiritual truth .\nMost of my clients and contacts tend to overlap the two to some degree , which creates somewhat of a sense of discordance or dissonance in their lives .\nOn the one hand , they hold the view that life is a spiritual journey in a temporary meat sack , and the events , situations , and circumstances revealed in the 3D world are kind of simulation , or matrix .\nIn this view , spiritual clarity is of utmost importance so that one does not find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly competing for their attention .\nThey know that \u2018 keeping their eye on the prize , \u2019 so to speak , is the best way to avoid the trap of lower consciousness , which is practically described by the emotional states of fear , apathy , anger , resentment , worry , concern , anxiety and overwhelm .\nOn the other hand , they \u2019 re drawn to endlessly \u2018 research \u2019 the dark side of the world , insatiably following the narratives and missives of the NWO , cabal , cartel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 are to be called .\nImmersed in this dark reality , they find it impossible to live steadily in higher consciousness , which is practically described by the emotional states of courage , neutrality , acceptance , willingness , reason , love and joy .\nIt \u2019 s a tough edge to balance on , living in two worlds , the truth seeker \u2019 s dilemma , and I \u2019 ve noticed that the distance between these two spaces resembles a void of sorts .\nIn this void they are neither living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration , nor do they succumb to the psychosis ,

World", "content": "The world is a confusing place .\nPeople do things that don \u2019 t make any sense , think things that aren \u2019 t supported by facts , endure things they do not need to endure , and viciously attack those who try to bring these things to their attention .\nIf you \u2019 ve ever wondered why , you \u2019 ve come to the right place .\nAny casual reader of the alternate-media landscape will eventually come up with a reference to Stanley Milgram , or Philip Zimbardo , the \u201c Asch Experiment \u201d or maybe all three .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Responsibility \u201d , and \u201c learned helplessness \u201d are phrases that regularly do the rounds , but where do they come from and what they mean ?\nWell , here are the important psycho-social experiments that teach us about the way people think ; but more than that , they actually explain how our modern world works and just how we got into this mess .\nThe Experiment : Let \u2019 s start with the most famous .\nBeginning in 1963 , Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram conducted a series of experiments now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe setting is simple , Subject A is told to conduct a memory test on Subject B , and administer electric shocks when he makes mistakes .\nOf course , Subject B does not exist , and the electric shocks are not real .\nInstead , actors would cry , ask for help or pretend to be unconscious , all the while Subject A would be encouraged to carry on administering the shocks .\nThe vast majority of subjects carried on with the test and gave the shocks , despite the distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conclusion : In his paper on this experiment Stanley Milgram coined the term \u201c diffusion of responsibility \u201d , describing the psychological process by which a person can excuse or justify doing harm to someone if they believe it \u2019 s not really their fault , they won \u2019 t be held accountable , or they do not have a choice .\nThe Application : Almost literally endless .\nAll institutions can use this phenomenon to pressure people into acting against their own moral code .\nThe army , the police , hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or perceived authority , people will fall victim to the diffusion of their own responsibility .\nNOTE : They made a decent film about Milgram , and the backlash his experiments caused called Experimenter .\nIn recent years there has been a major pushback on this experiment , with articles in the MSM attacking the findings and methodology and new \u201c researchers \u201d claiming \u201c it does not prove what you think it does.\n\u201d The Experiment : Only slightly less famous than Milgram \u2019 s work is Philip Zimbardo \u2019 s Prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1971 .\nThe experiment set up a mock-prison for a week , with one group of subjects designated \u201c guards \u201d and the other \u201c prisoners \u201d .\nBoth sides were provided uniforms , and prisoners were given a number .\nThe guards were ordered to only ever address prisoners by their number , not their name .\nThere were a number of other rules and procedures , detailed here .\nIn brief , over the course of the week , guards became increasingly sadistic , dealing out punishments to disobedient prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to try and divide them .\nMany of the prisoners simply took the abuse , and in-fighting began between \u201c trouble makers \u201d and \u201c good prisoners \u201d .\nThough technically not an \u201c experiment \u201d in the purest sense ( there was no hypothesis to test , and no control group ) , and perhaps impacted by \u201c demand characteristics \u201d , the study does reveal interesting patterns of behaviour in its subjects .\nThe Conclusion : Prison guards became sadistic .\nPrisoners became obedient .\nAll this despite no real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority , and no real requirement to stay .\nIf you give people power and dehumanise those below them , they will become sadistic .\nIf you put people in prison they will act like they are in prison .\nIn short , people will act the way they are treated .\nThe Application : Again , endless .\nWe \u2019 ve seen it all through Covid , if you start treating people a certain way , the majority will go along with it and blame the minority who refuse to cooperate .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ were suddenly granted new powers , and promptly abused them because the maskless and unvaxxed had been dehumanised in their eyes .\nThose reactions were engineered , not accidental .\nThe Experiment : Another experiment in conformity , not as brutal as Milgram or Zimbardo , but perhaps more unsettling in its findings .\nFirst conducted by Solomon Asch in the 1950s , the setup is a simple one .\nYou put together a panel of subjects , one real subject and a handful of fake subjects .\nOne by one the subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which the answer is always obvious , and all the fake subjects will get every answer wrong .\nThe question is whether or not the real subject will maintain his own correct answer , or begin to conform with the group .\nThe Conclusion : While most people maintained their right answers , the \u201c error rate \u201d in the experiment group was 37 % versus less than 1 % in the control group .\nMeaning 36 % of subjects eventually began to change their answers to align with the consensus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAround one-third of people will either pretend to change their minds for the sake of conformity or , more alarmingly , will actually alter their beliefs if they find themselves in the minority .\nThe Application : Staged or invented polls , falsified vote counts in elections , bot accounts on social media , astroturfing campaigns .\nMedia headlines proclaiming \u201c everyone knows X \u201d or \u201c only 1 % of people think Y \u201d .\nThere are a great many tools you can use in order to create the impression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactured \u201c majority \u201d .\nNOTE : The experiment has been done a million times in dozens of variations , but perhaps the most interesting finding is that putting just one other person in the panel who agrees with the test subject seemed to reduce conformity by 87 % .\nEssentially , people hate being a lone voice but will tolerate being in the minority if they have some support .\nGood to know .\nThe Experiment : The least well-known experiment on the list , but in some ways the most fascinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment to evaluate the phenomenon of cognitive dissonance , his setup was again quite simple .\nA subject is given a repetitive and dull physical task to do ( originally turning wooden pegs , but other variations use other tasks ) .\nAfter the task is complete , the subject is instruced to go and prepare the next subject ( actually a lab assistant ) for the task , by lying and telling him/her how interesting the task was .\nIt \u2019 s at this point the subjects are divided into two groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lie , the other only $ 1 .\nThis is the real experiment .\nThe Conclusion : After lying to the fake subjects , and being paid their money , the real subjects take part in a post-experiment interview and record their genuine thoughts on the task .\nInterestingly , the 20-dollar group generally told the truth , that they found the task dull and repetitive .\nWhile the one-dollar group , more often than not , claimed to have genuinely enjoyed the task .\nThis is cognitive dissonance in action .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the money was a good reason to lie to their fellow test subject , and they could justify their own behaviour in their head .\nBut , for the $ 1 group , the meagreness of the reward made their dishonesty internally unjustifiable , so they had to unconsciously create their own justification by convincing themselves they weren \u2019 t lying at all .\nIn summary , if you offer people a small reward for doing something , they will pretend to enjoy it , or be otherwise invested , to justify @ @ @ @ @ @", "author":

increasingly difficult in these times to speak of \u2018 non-verifiable \u2019 or unprovable matters , especially concerns of the spirit-consciousness , for too many people are inculcated with fixed beliefs and thinking patterns .\nThis is itself a sign of social conditioning and of a certain \u2018 management of mind.\n\u2019 We should not be surprised that this situation is rife throughout our societies and cultures and is becoming increasingly predominant .\nSocial norms are persuading many people to prefer safety and security rather than the potential discomfort that comes from gaining new realizations and understanding .\nAn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defected to the West ( Gregory Klimov ) , revealed that in the fields of Soviet psychological warfare ( and social psychology ) they utilized the principles of psychoanalysis .\nIn this , they saw the phenomena of evil as a \u2018 complicated , complex social illness.\n\u2019 The psychoanalysts within the KGB equated evil with illness , especially an illness of the human psyche .\nThis perspective places demonic actors and events as \u2018 objective realities ; \u2019 i.e.\n, as various forms of illness of \u2018 psyche and soul.\n\u2019 As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u2018 The devils represents an involved and complex process of degeneracy or retrogression that in the main consists of three parts : sexual deviation , psychic illnesses and some physical deformities of the organism .\nThe number of humans already afflicted with this degeneration is legion.\n\u2019 1 Bondarev goes on to say that , based on certain social-psychological testing , the greatest degeneracy exists within the so-called elite of the world ( as much as 75 % ) .\nWhat this points to , concludes Bondarev , is a drastic decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also tells us is that the phenomenon of \u2018 evil \u2019 does not necessarily need to be personified or projected into certain personages as it represents an illness of the human psyche .\nWe can recognize its presence operating within psychic imbalance and internal disconnect and detachment .\nAnd I would concur with Bondarev \u2019 s conclusion in that such psychic dis-ease represents an inner disconnect with the transcendental impulse .\nThis disconnect , or splintering , from a sacred source has now come to signify the nature of the reversal that epitomizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within this reversal that we see much of the negating , or counter-evolutionary , forces within humanity .\nAnd these forces have been dominating much of our everyday lives and continue to do so .\nI would suggest that it is our individual responsibility to recognize these forces , attempt to comprehend them , and to transform them into impulses that can work for humankind \u2019 s evolvement .\nIn this , we need to come to grips with the presence and activity of those aspects that signify a psychic illness , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a feature of existence as much as positive , developmental forces .\nThey all act within the playground of attraction , repulsion , and the expression of energy .\nThe Rosicrucians recognized these forces when they referred to the Deus Inversus \u2013 or the \u2018 Reversed God.\n\u2019 This nature of reversal works on humanity through the spheres of imbalance and disharmony to counteract civilizational development .\nThe Austrian mystic Rudolf Steiner was aware of the future impact of such forces when he stated that : \u2018 It is essential that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear at the wrong place must be taken in hand\u2026in such a way that humanity can achieve something with these forces of evil that will be beneficial for the future of the whole of world evolution.\n\u2019 2 In this regard , it is important that the individual becomes aware of the metaphysical realm that lies beyond the threshold of normal , or every day , consciousness .\nIf we remain unawares to our own forces of spirit-consciousness , then we are more susceptible to the manipulations of such counter-developmental forces .\nThose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I have attempted to draw attention to certain aspects of our consensus reality in order to gain greater clarity about how we may respond to the situation in a constructive way .\nI stand by what was written in the Gnostic Gospel of Philip : \u2018 For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden , it is strong .\nBut when it is recognized , it is dissolved .\nWhen it is revealed , it perishes.\n\u2019 Recognition , through heightened awareness and perception , brings more choice into play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of certain facts before they can manifest the correct intention and focus of will .\nWhat is needed is a culture of revelation \u2013 of \u2018 uncovering \u2019 \u2013 rather than of cover up .\nIt is through revelation that insight into the metaphysical foundation of life can be sustained within our increasingly materialistic societies .\nThis access to metaphysical realities can never be wholly eradicated .\nYet just a cursory glance at modern life indicates that there are attempts to deepen peoples \u2019 immersion into deteriorating forms of dissonance and distraction .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reality deceit .\nThe great deceit that is coming upon us is the unveiling of a so-called \u2018 utopia \u2019 based on the isolation of the human spirit-consciousness .\nThis fake promise is wrapped up in tech-salvationist terms , heralding a false ideal future .\nThe real dis-ease of the human condition is to be in a state of estrangement .\nThat is , estranged and alienated from any metaphysical influence or nourishment .\nIt is not that the metaphysical background to life must necessarily be obvious to us , or tangible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are cognizant of its existence and continual influence .\nYet once this sense of recognition ( the act of aware cognition ) is dissolved , a barren soulless life is the result .\nAnd yet , in most circumstances , people will not be cognizant of this loss \u2013 this lack of the transcendental impulse in their lives \u2013 for they will be entrained into a reality consisting of a physical-digital mesh that keeps them attached to their lower nature and desires .\nThis deceit consists of a most heinous form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a willing one as well as an ignorant one .\nThe splintering of the human being from its metaphysical connection shall go almost unnoticed , and the transfer into a reality of limited consciousness will have been enacted quite skillfully .\nThis sly route to a human condition of alienation , procured through the guise of technological advancement and progress , will be a coup against the creative spirit .\nAnd this shall be the reversal of the human reality \u2013 the reality deceit .\nThe almost imperceptible dangers are that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed through a realm of fantasy and make-believe , which now fuels the crass and superficial culture industries that dominate modern life .\nAny notion of Higher Reality has been twisted into an artificial lesser reality that attempts to hinder , as far as is possible , the developmental impulse from penetrating .\nThis arrangement has culminated in dissociating humankind not only from its natural , organic , carbon-based environment , but also from an inherent contact with its origin \u2013 Source consciousness .\nThis increasing disembodiment is reflected in such forms as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Metaverse ) , computerization ( including algorithms ) , and artificial intelligence .\nFor many people today , their digital devices have become their instruments of salvation .\nBut this salvation , this divine deliverance , belongs to the Deus Inversus \u2013 and we should choose our gods carefully .\nWe should be careful too , not to be pulled into the encroaching banalization of life .\nAnd we should be on the look-out for signs and signals .\nIf anyone wishes to see how \u2018 signals \u2019 can operate within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episodes in the recent Westworld TV series ( 2016-2022 ) .\nIn Season Four , the machinic android \u2018 hosts \u2019 have taken control of the world using a bioengineered virus that infects humans over the course of a generation , turning them docile and susceptible to AI and \u2018 host \u2019 control .\nStorylines and narratives are created in order to give people their roles and characters in life , which they passively follow believing them to be their own life stories .\nHumankind is managed through these manufactured \u2018 storylines \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are transmitted directly to the minds and lives of humans through a series of radio-sonic transmission signals via the global technological infrastructure\u2026But then again , this is just a fantasy story after all .\nThe course of external events that inform our political , economic , and cultural systems are not arbitrary , coincidental or natural .\nThe modern human has been subtly manipulated into disconnecting from , and even shunning , the guidance of higher impulses .\nWe are being told that the human being alone is the sole and dominant driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , we are propelled ever further into the personality construct with the human ego at the wheel .\nWe are standing at the threshold of adopting a glorified materialistic view of life and the world .\nThe spell of this disease is working to over-materialize materialism in a very deliberate and nefarious way .\nThere may be some discomfort in the unfoldment of awareness , yet this is part of the transmutation of the dis-ease .\nLife \u2018 in reversal \u2019 is working hard and fast on this intensifying of materialism .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion of consciousness but is actively working to stagnate it .\nAt the same time , we are moving through an impulse of increasing individual awareness against the backdrop of this over-materialization .\nYet it is an awareness through the few , and not the many ( yet ) .\nBy recognizing that certain forces within the world are using processes of mass suggestion to introduce a simplification \u2013 or \u2018 dumbing down \u2019 \u2013 of human consciousness , we can gain greater awareness over our condition and predicament .\nAnd in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance and protection , as recognition allows a discernment to be made .\nIt is this discernment to step away from the negating energies and frequencies of toxicity that can help a person to attune to a resonance of perceptive consciousness .\nBy choosing where we place ourselves \u2013 our focus and attention \u2013 we can either take a step forward or stay where we are and stagnate .\nAs always , the choice remains with us .\nKingsley L.

was the world \u2019 s first billionaire1 ( he \u2019 d be worth around $ 13.7 billion in today \u2019 s money ) .\nAs a Republican , Rockefeller supported Abolition , back when southern Democrat-voting industrialists profited from their human property .\nHe was also a Methodist/Baptist Christian who believed that god had made him rich .\nIn 1864 , he founded the grain and produce company , Clark , Rockefeller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maurice Clark ( 1827-1901 ) .\nThe company profited from the American Civil War ( 1861-65 ) 2 and Rockefeller used his money to establish the company that made him his fortune : Standard Oil of California .\nWith notions of the Protestant work ethic and Christian charity , Rockefeller and his employees attempted to craft an image of the family dynasty as philanthropic .\nRockefeller \u2019 s various institutes and foundations spawned other entities , including the University of Chicago , the General Education Board , and the eponymous Institute for Medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , letters , and memos from the time confirm that the motive was primarily to make the public healthier and more educated in order to get them to work for the businesses in which Rockefeller had invested .\nBy the mid-20th century , it was clear that \u201c philanthropy \u201d was also a massive , legal tax dodge.3 Rockefeller \u2019 s profit-making agenda included the promotion of so-called \u201c scientific medicine , \u201d which has now become the norm .\nAlthough Rockefeller personally championed natural remedies , including homeopathy , publicly he funded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the machine that brought America \u2019 s medical practices up to Europe \u2019 s technological standards .\nBut institutions , be they religious , corporate , or national , are not self-containing .\nThey expand .\nRockefeller \u2019 s philanthropy was de facto colonialism in countries including China and the Philippines , where the offshoots of his Foundation trained indigenous elites to use Western \u201c scientific medicines \u201d and lessen their traditional , natural cures .\nTHE FOUNDATION AT HOME : \u201c HEALTH IS PROFITABLE \u201d Former US President Bill Clinton ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The academic study of public health owes its origins to Rockefeller , who financed the earliest programs at institutions like Johns Hopkins and Harvard [ Universities ] .\n\u201d 4 Not all 19th century US physicians had formal qualifications .\nFounded in 1846-47 , the American Medical Association lobbied to ensure that physicians were qualified and trained up to particular standards.5 But the formalisation of healthcare training reinforced the race , gender , and class structure in that females , poor people , and non-whites were typically excluded.6 In addition to producing young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle- and upper-classes , the system also battled natural health in favour of the new \u201c scientific medicine.\n\u201d 7 By contrast , the Popular Health Movement was a natural health lobby which , in the 1850s , sought to remove legal protections for reckless physicians .\nDespite Rockefeller \u2019 s private belief in homeopathy , one of the effects of his Foundation \u2019 s work in medicine was to undermine natural alternatives to chemical prescriptions .\nThe formalisation of GP training led to monopolies .\nMost medical courses were offered by just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pennsylvania.8 As late as the early-20th century , US doctors typically trained in Europe .\nRockefeller \u2019 s agenda was to bring the US medical profession up to Europe \u2019 s standards.9 Rockefeller modelled his health foundation on Berlin \u2019 s Koch Institute ( founded 1891 ) and Paris \u2019 s Pasteur Institute ( 1887 ) .\nAfter studying in France and Germany , the American parasitologist , Charles Wardell Stiles ( 1867-1941 ) , went to work at the Rockefeller Foundation \u2019 s forerunner , the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission .\nStiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which mainly affected agricultural workers and thus Rockefeller et al.\n\u2019 s profits in his textiles investments .\nStiles believed that hookworm caused \u201c some of the proverbial laziness of the poorer classes of the white population.\n\u201d 10 One of Rockefeller \u2019 s main ideologues was the Baptist clergyman , Reverend Frederick Taylor Gates ( 1853-1929 , no relation to Bill ) .\nIn the capitalist spirit of the age , Gates saw the human body as an amalgam of separate parts , akin to a factory .\nGates \u2019 s view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body like the liver , stomach , pancreas , kidneys , gall bladder , are great local manufacturing centres , formed of groups of cells in infinite number , manufacturing the same sorts of products , just as industries.\n\u201d 11 Gates initially advised Rockefeller \u2019 s Standard Oil before promoting the magnate \u2019 s health ventures .\nGates noted that at any one time , 20 per cent of staff in any given institution was home sick each day and said that \u201c health is found in a variety of ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Rockefeller-founded University of Chicago \u2019 s 1898 efforts to align with the pro-homeopathy Rush Medical College .\nAfter studying in Germany , the bacteriologist and pathologist William H. Welch ( 1850-1934 ) co-founded the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health .\nGates asked Welch to run the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research , which by 1928 had received $ 28m in funding ( around $ 385m today ) .13 Hookworms are parasitic organisms that live in the abdomen and are typically picked up by affected persons when walking barefoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have defecated .\nThe roots of the Foundation \u2019 s global health hegemony were planted in the American south , where Black agricultural labourers continued to toil in cotton fields.14 The Foundation \u2019 s failed efforts to eradicate hookworms nevertheless gave the planners enough confidence that their work could be exported .\nBut their methods sought to integrate foreign traditional healers into \u201c scientific \u201d medical practices .\nHistorian Angela Matysiak writes that during the 1917 campaign to eradicate hookworm in Brazil , civil society feared that Rockefeller \u2019 s International Health Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural healers .\n\u201c To address these tensions , the staff of the IHB in Brazil , Costa Rica , and other countries looked for ways to integrate native healers into public health campaigns.\n\u201d But Rockefeller opposed domestic natural medicines ; at least for the public .\nFor example , it was only when the supply of the drug thymol was disrupted by the First World War ( 1914-18 ) that Rockefeller \u2019 s IHB gave patients oil of chenopodium ( the flower of the goosefoot plant ) .\nWith zero ethical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors poisoned to death 222 children with the oil between 1914 and 1932 , something that natural healers were unlikely to have done.15 The Rockefeller Foundation established a series of successive health entities to exploit foreign medicines and assimilate other people \u2019 s traditional practices into Western-led methods .\nThe International Health Board and its successors spent billions of dollars ( tens of billions in today \u2019 s money ) in over 100 countries , establishing 25 schools and institutes , and sponsoring over 2,500 nurseries.16 The entities included the International Health Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a.k.a.\n, Division , 1916-27 ) .\nAt the time , representatives of the global body , the League of Nations , described Rockefeller \u2019 s International Health Board as \u201c the only existing truly international agency which is working at present to further constructive work in the domain of public health all over the world.\n\u201d 17 The motives were profit-driven .\nRockefeller Foundation President , George E. Vincent ( 1864-1941 ) , said that when it came to conquering foreigners , public health had \u201c advantages over machine guns.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Moro tribes and acted , in the words of Foundation officers , as \u201c wedge for permanent civilising influences.\n\u201d 19 After the British Empire \u2019 s occupation ( circa 1842-1912 ) , but before the economic nationalism of Chairman Mao ( 1893-1976 ) , US investors sought to exploit China \u2019 s huge working population and raw materials .\nRockefeller and his successors funded the Peking Union Medical College to the tune of $ 45m ( or half a billion today ) .\nChinese traditional medicine includes but is not limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herbs , and qigong .\nIt has been used for thousands of years and is regularly attacked in the West by advocates of Big Pharma .\nRockefeller money started the anti-traditional medicine movement in China while taking some of its ideas and products to synthesise them as modern drugs .\nFor instance , ephedra plants are shrubs that grow in most countries and produce certain green teas .\nKnown in Chinese medicine as ma-huang ( right , above ) , ephedra shrubs have been used for 5,000 years and were first catalogued by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese Professor , Nagayoshi Nagai , isolated ephedrine from the shrub in 1885 to produce synthetic chemicals for blood pressure treatment .\nThe Rockefeller-funded Peking Union Medical College took credit for isolating and synthesising the chemical .\nThe Lancet reports that the College \u201c spread modern medical sciences throughout China.\n\u201d 21 Today , we hear about the dangers of \u201c vaccine nationalism.\n\u201d 22 Russia \u2019 s Sputnik V vaccine against Sars-CoV-2 ( COVID-19 ) was demonised by Western media23 before being accepted as > 90 per cent efficacious by Western journals.24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold to the British public as effective,25 yet several heads of state at the European Union , which is promoting the US-German Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine , publicly cautioned against the UK vaccine .\nVaccine nationalism began with the Rockefeller Foundation .\nYellow fever is a deadly ( 50 per cent death-rate ) mosquito-derived , tropical virus.26 Rockefeller \u2019 s International Health Board stoked controversy by pointing to side effects in yellow fever vaccines developed by rival institutes , such as the Pasteur Institute , which was operating in France \u2019 s colonial subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial failures .\nThe authors of an article on biological history state : \u201c the success of [ Rockefeller- ] sponsored anti-yellow fever campaigns was obtained through a traditional means : the elimination of the disease \u2019 s vector , the mosquito.\n\u201d 27 \u201c Paris Green \u201d was named after its use against rats in the sewers of the famous French capital .\nIt is an arsenic-based toxin that was used as an insecticide .\nIt was mass-produced in New York .\nThe Bulletin of the

Reveals the Truth About Subliminal Messages", "content": "We \u2019 re all being conditioned to think and believe certain things without any rational explanation through subliminal messaging in advertising , music , film , television , political propaganda , and military psychological operations .\nConsidering the definition of the word subliminal \u2013 \u2018 existing or functioning below the threshold of consciousness \u2019 \u2013 it is easy to downplay the power of this brainwashing technique because most people are not consciously aware that it is happening , yet , it is affecting their lives .\nOnce you realize that subliminal messaging is real and start to pay attention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are , indeed , all being conditioned to behave a certain way , to want certain things , and to believe in ideas , without being able to rationally explain why .\nBelow is a short video in which Jeff Warrick , the director of Programming the Nation ( 2011 ) , offers his take on the truth about subliminal messaging .\nWarrick shares a few examples of messages embedded within ads , which are not likely to be seen consciously , but are admitted into the subconscious mind .\nA common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is skepticism and disbelief that sexual innuendos or random words embedded in pictures or film will not impact a person \u2019 s willingness to buy a product .\nAlthough it is a common assumption that sex sells because for most people it is associated with feelings of pleasure , excitement , enjoyment or even love , subliminal messaging is about much more than helping advertisers sell more product .\nThese messages are designed to have an impact on general consumer behavior and affect people \u2019 s life patterns , thus molding society as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more receptive consumers .\nWhen bombarded with subliminal messaging , the mind is likely to trigger emotions , memories or feelings , without a person \u2019 s conscious recognition of why they feel a certain way .\nA person may not consciously realize why they start to become more attracted to certain behaviors , lifestyles or products , but they are more likely to succumb to the attraction .\nAre subliminal messages contributing to a variety of economic , social , and political problems currently present in our culture , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-consumption and debt ?\nThere are many examples that support this idea and demonstrate that subliminal messaging , over time , can have a powerful impact .\nTake , for instance , advertising to women .\nIf you look at any variety of ads that are targeted at women ages 18-35 , an overwhelming majority will personify that women and girls should be thin , wear lots of makeup , style their hair in certain ways , and , of course , look very sexy .\nIt almost appears as though it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women feel bad about themselves .\nSee the following example of women in advertising in the video below : Other examples are films such as the Rambo series of the 1980 \u2019 s and the more resent American Sniper , which glorify mindless military self-sacrifice , torture and violence .\nThey romanticize obedience to authority and unquestioning loyalty to a war-mongering government .\nBelow is the complete documentary by Jeff Warrick , Programming the Nation , that offers a full history behind subliminal message .\nIn the film , Warrick examines if subliminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States public to become one of the highest consuming nations in the world , accounting for about 25 percent use of the worlds natural resources even though its populace makes up less than 5 percent of the global population .\nDylan Charles is a self-mastery and self-sabotage coach , the editor of Waking Times , and host of the Battered Souls

{"id": "wakingtimes--2022-09-23--Why Orwell Matters", "date": "2022-09-23", "source": "wakingtimes", "title": "Why Orwell Matters", "content": "Most people think that George Orwell was writing about , and against , totalitarianism \u2013 especially when they encounter him through the prism of his great dystopian novel , Nineteen Eighty-Four .\nThis view of Orwell is not wrong , but it can miss something .\nFor Orwell was concerned above all about the particular threat posed by totalitarianism to words and language .\nHe was concerned about the threat it posed to our ability to think and speak freely and truthfully .\nAbout the threat it posed to our freedom .\nHe saw , clearly and vividly , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose control of meaning .\nThat is what frightened him about the totalitarianism of Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia \u2013 these regimes wanted to control the very linguistic substance of thought itself .\nAnd that is why Orwell continues to speak to us so powerfully today .\nBecause words , language and meaning are under threat once more .\nThe totalitarian regimes of Nazi Germany and Stalin \u2019 s Soviet Union represented something new and frightening for Orwell .\nAuthoritarian dictatorships , in which power was wielded unaccountably and arbitrarily , had existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century different was the extent to which they demanded every individual \u2019 s complete subservience to the state .\nThey sought to abolish the very basis of individual freedom and autonomy .\nThey wanted to use dictatorial powers to socially engineer the human soul itself , changing and shaping how people think and behave .\nTotalitarian regimes set about breaking up clubs , trade unions and other voluntary associations .\nThey were effectively dismantling those areas of social and political life in which people were able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaces , that is , in which local and national culture develops free of the state and officialdom .\nThese cultural spaces were always tremendously important to Orwell .\nAs he put it in his 1941 essay , \u2018 England Your England \u2019 : \u2018 All the culture that is most truly native centres round things which even when they are communal are not official \u2013 the pub , the football match , the back garden , the fireside and the \u201c nice cup of tea \u201d .\n\u2019 Totalitarianism may have reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stalin \u2019 s USSR .\nBut Orwell was worried about its effect in the West , too .\nHe was concerned about the Sovietisation of Europe through the increasingly prominent and powerful Stalinist Communist Parties .\nHe was also worried about what he saw as Britain \u2019 s leftwing \u2018 Europeanised intelligentsia \u2019 , which , like the Communist Parties of Western Europe , seemed to worship state power , particularly in the supranational form of the USSR .\nAnd he was concerned above all about the emergence of the totalitarian mindset , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structures of mind and feeling that lie at the heart of autonomy and liberty .\nOrwell could see this mindset flourishing among Britain \u2019 s intellectual elite , from the eugenics and top-down socialism of Fabians , like Sidney and Beatrice Webb and HG Wells , to the broader technocratic impulses of the intelligentsia in general .\nThey wanted to remake people \u2018 for their own good \u2019 , or for the benefit of the race or state power .\nThey therefore saw it as desirable to force people to conform to certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the everyday freedom of people who wanted , as Orwell put it , \u2018 the liberty to have a home of your own , to do what you like in your spare time , to choose your own amusements instead of having them chosen for you from above \u2019 .\nIn the aftermath of the Second World War , this new intellectual elite started to gain ascendancy .\nIt was effectively a clerisy \u2013 a cultural and ruling elite defined by its academic achievements .\nIt had been forged through higher education and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege and wealth , such as public schools .\nOrwell was naturally predisposed against this emergent clerisy .\nHe may have attended Eton , but that \u2019 s where Orwell \u2019 s education stopped .\nHe was not part of the clerisy \u2019 s world .\nHe was not an academic writer , nor did he position himself as such .\nOn the contrary , he saw himself as a popular writer , addressing a broad , non-university-educated audience .\nMoreover , Orwell \u2019 s antipathy towards this new elite type was long-standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pomposity of imperial officialdom as a minor colonial police official in Burma between 1922 and 1927 .\nAnd he had always battled against the top-down socialist great and good , and much of academia , too , who were often very much hand in glove with the Stalinised left .\nThe hostility was mutual .\nIndeed , it accounts for the disdain that many academics and their fellow travellers continue to display towards Orwell today .\nNowadays we are all too familiar with this university-educated ruling caste , and its desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , of the way in which our cultural and educational elites have turned \u2018 fascism \u2019 from a historically specific phenomenon into a pejorative that has lost all meaning , to be used to describe anything from Brexit to Boris Johnson \u2019 s Tory government \u2013 a process Orwell saw beginning with the Stalinist practice of calling Spanish democratic revolutionaries \u2018 Trotsky-fascists \u2019 ( which he documented in Homage to Catalonia ( 1938 ) ) .\nOr think of the way in which our cultural and educational elites have transformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man \u2019 and \u2018 woman \u2019 , divesting them of any connection to biological reality .\nOrwell would not have been surprised by this development .\nIn Nineteen Eighty-Four , he shows how the totalitarian state and its intellectuals will try to suppress real facts , and even natural laws , if they diverge from their worldview .\nThrough exerting power over ideas , they seek to shape reality .\n\u2018 Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together in new shapes of your own choosing \u2019 , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual .\n\u2018 We control matter because we control the mind .\nReality is inside the skull\u2026 You must get rid of these 19th-century ideas about the laws of nature.\n\u2019 In Nineteen Eighty-Four , the totalitarian regime tries to subject history to similar manipulation .\nAs anti-hero Winston Smith tells his lover , Julia : As Orwell wrote elsewhere , \u2018 the historian believes that the past can not be altered and that a correct knowledge of history is valuable as a matter of course .\nFrom the totalitarian point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than learned.\n\u2019 This totalitarian approach to history is dominant today , from the New York Times \u2019 1619 Project to statue-toppling .\nHistory is something to be erased or conjured up or reshaped as a moral lesson for today .\nIt is used to demonstrate the rectitude of the contemporary establishment .\nBut it is language that is central to Orwell \u2019 s analysis of this form of intellectual manipulation and thought-control .\nTake \u2018 Ingsoc \u2019 , the philosophy that the regime follows and enforces through the linguistic system of Newspeak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt is an attempt to make certain ideas \u2013 freedom , autonomy and so on \u2013 actually unthinkable or impossible .\nIt is an attempt to eliminate the very possibility of dissent ( or \u2018 thoughtcrime \u2019 ) .\nAs Syme , who is working on a Newspeak dictionary , tells Winston Smith : The parallels between Orwell \u2019 s nightmarish vision of totalitarianism and the totalitarian mindset of today , in which language is policed and controlled , should not be overstated .\nIn the dystopia of Nineteen Eighty-Four , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in Nazi Germany or Stalinist Russia , was backed up by a brutal , murderous secret police .\nThere is little of that in our societies today \u2013 people are not forcibly silenced or disappeared .\nHowever , they are cancelled , pushed out of their jobs , and sometimes even arrested by the police for what amounts to thoughtcrime .\nAnd many more people simply self-censor out of fear of saying the \u2018 wrong \u2019 thing .\nOrwell \u2019 s concern that words could be erased or their meaning altered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realised in an openly dictatorial manner .\nNo , it \u2019 s being achieved through a creeping cultural and intellectual conformism .\nBut then that was always Orwell \u2019 s worry \u2013 that intellectuals giving up on freedom would allow a Big Brother Britain to flourish .\nAs he saw it in The Prevention of Literature ( 1946 ) , the biggest danger to freedom of speech and thought came not from the threat of dictatorship ( which was receding by then ) but from intellectuals giving up on freedom , or worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the realisation of their worldview .\nInterestingly , his concerns about an intellectual betrayal of freedom were reinforced by a 1944 meeting of the anti-censorship organisation , English PEN .\nAttending an event to mark the 300th anniversary of Milton \u2019 s Areopagitica , Milton \u2019 s famous 1644 speech making the case for the \u2018 Liberty of Unlicenc \u2019 d Printing \u2019 , Orwell noted that many of the left-wing intellectuals present were unwilling to criticise Soviet Russia or wartime censorship .\nIndeed , they had become profoundly indifferent or hostile to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom .\nOrwell was concerned by the increasing popularity among influential left-wing intellectuals of \u2018 the much more tenable and dangerous proposition that freedom is undesirable and that intellectual honesty is a form of anti-social selfishness \u2019 .\nThe exercise of freedom of speech and thought , the willingness to speak truth to power , was even then becoming seen as something to be frowned upon , a selfish , even elitist act .\nAn individual speaking freely and honestly , wrote Orwell , is \u2018 accused of either wanting to shut himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of making an exhibitionist display of his own personality , or of resisting the inevitable current of history in an attempt to cling to unjustified privilege \u2019 .\nThese are insights which have stood the test of time .\nJust think of the imprecations against those who challenge the consensus .\nThey are dismissed as \u2018 contrarians \u2019 and accused of selfishly upsetting people .\nAnd worst of all , think of the way free speech is damned as the right of the privileged .\nThis is possibly one of the greatest lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not support privilege .\nWe all have the capacity to speak , write , think and argue .\nWe might not , as individuals or small groups , have the platforms of a press baron or the BBC .\nBut it is only through our freedom to speak freely that we can challenge those with greater power .\nOrwell is everywhere today .\nHe is taught in schools and his ideas and phrases are part of our common culture .\nBut his value and importance to us lies in his defence of freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write .\nHis outstanding 1946 essay , \u2018 Politics and the English Language \u2019 , can actually be read as a freedom manual .\nIt is a guide on how to use words and language to fight back .\nOf course , it is attacked today as an expression of privilege and of bigotry .\nAuthor and commentator Will Self cited \u2018 Politics and the English Language \u2019 in a 2014 BBC Radio 4 show as proof that Orwell was an \u2018 authoritarian elitist \u2019 .\nHe said : \u2018 Reading Orwell at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct impression he \u2019 s saying these things , in precisely this way , because he knows that you \u2013 and you alone \u2013 are exactly the sort of person who \u2019 s sufficiently intelligent to comprehend the very essence of what he \u2019 s trying to communicate .\nIt \u2019 s this the mediocrity-loving English masses respond to \u2013 the talented dog-whistler calling them to chow down on a big bowl of conformity.\n\u2019 Lionel Trilling , another writer and thinker , made a similar point to Self , but in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 [ Orwell ] liberates us \u2019 , he wrote in 1952 : Orwell should be a figure for us , too \u2013 in our battle to restore the democracy of the mind and resist the totalitarian mindset of today .\nBut this will require having the courage of our convictions and our words , as he so often did himself .\nAs he put it in The Prevention of Literature , \u2018 To write in plain vigorous language one has to think fearlessly \u2019 .\nThat Orwell did precisely that was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as much as his belief in himself .\nHe sets an example and a challenge to us all .\n**This is an edited version of a speech given at this year \u2019 s Living Freedom , an annual residential school

of knowledge and influence : the rise of the intellectual and mass media .\nIt is perhaps no coincidence that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impasse approximately a century later , with many of the same conditions present today , only on a much more pervasive level .\nThe parallels between then and now are astonishing .\nThis should not be viewed as \u2018 history repeating itself \u2019 but rather as a more intense interlude of what had already come to pass \u2013 only this time events are unfolding at much greater speed , propelled by advances in communication technology on a global scale inconceivable to previous generations .\nSuch changes were equally profound in 1900 , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society .\nAs the 20th century approached , theology was supplanted by evolutionary science .\nAn ascendant Darwinian authority presided over existential questions like \u201c Who are we ?\n\u201d and \u201c What is man \u2019 s purpose ?\n\u201d Undoubtedly , this was a tumultuous time , intellectually and spiritually , with acrimony leading to heated exchanges between clergy and scientists , even leading to violent confrontations .\nBut , with its newfound status , it was inevitable the secular power of Darwinian science would colonise the political and social sciences before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curative breeding known as eugenics .\nRecent history leaves no doubt that if left unrestrained by morals and ethics , wanton destruction and incredible suffering are wrought in the name of science and progress .\nThese forces of modernity materialise in today \u2019 s advances in genetic engineering that have brought us back to that point once again : humanity faces the dilemma of resisting game-changing advances of technology and innovation or surrendering to it and prostrating at the altar of science and progress .\nWe are an entire century into a fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s tech gurus , vaccinologists , and public health officials now occupy positions of prestige and command the reverence once reserved for pontiffs , philosophers , and poet laureates .\nThe divine mysteries have given way to the \u2018 divine \u2019 algorithm , and timeless sublime prose to the transience of the latest epidemiological model \u2013 from Gandhi to Gates , Whitman to Whitty , in just a few generations .\nHow else could a man like Dr Anthony Fauci , an 80-year-old career gatekeeper for the transnational pharmaceutical cartel , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job , and recently voted People Magazine \u2019 s \u201c sexiest man alive \u201d ?\nAlbert Camus once said , \u201c Nothing is more despicable than respect based on fear.\n\u201d Indeed , if not for the wave of mass hysteria and fear that swept over the world in February 2020 , few would even know of Dr Fauci , let alone revere him as a demigod .\nOn one level , we may be deluded into believing that today \u2019 s gaudy exhibitionists are mere frivolities of pure media spectacle , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unforgiving ideology called technocracy .\nYou will often hear the trope that \u201c more people have been killed over religion than anything else.\n\u201d If only it were true .\nThe 20th century serves as a potent reminder of the misleading nature of that statement , for no other century witnessed the sheer brutality and crimes against humanity on an industrial scale perpetrated in the name of various despotic interpretations of some variant of social Darwinism or political science , reaching levels of totalitarianism never seen before in human history .\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WWII , Nazi Germany , Soviet Russia , Maoist China , Cambodia , Vietnam , Central America , Afghanistan , and Iraq , to name only a few .\nIn almost every instance , the preservation of secular dogma took precedence over the lives and souls of humans who were unfortunate enough to be caught in the crossfire of \u2018 progress \u2019 .\nFascism , socialism , communism , neoliberal capitalism \u2013 each would justify collateral damage as a means to achieving the goal of transformation or the formulation of a new order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces that inherited the mantle of power \u2013 the dynastic families and special interests \u2013 are preparing the next act in this worldly saga .\nSo often it \u2019 s been said that in war , history is written by the victors , who impose what is known as the \u2018 living memory \u2019 of a nation or people , chronicling a shared experience , generally of collective sacrifice undertaken for the greater good , and paying tribute to the martyrs along the way .\nThese become the narratives that post-war orders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillar around which the reorganisation of society and economies occurs .\nWithout marshalling the \u201c narrative , \u201d a ruling establishment can not lead and steer society in its direction of choice .\nWhat happens in the absence of a bona fide world war ?\nCan elites still construct an equally compelling living memory which the people can rally around ?\nGrand narrative management is precisely what Klaus Schwab \u2019 s World Economic Forum ( WEF ) has been attempting from the onset of the \u2018 global pandemic \u2019 crisis .\nIn 2021 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Narrative \u201d initiative , although evidence for this project can be traced much further back through a number of their documents and website presentations .\nTo create the requisite living memory , Schwab and the WEF replaced the usual military war piece with the new war on microbes .\n\u201c The pandemic has revealed the acute need to focus on the future and long-term health of our societies , \u201d said the globalist luminary .\nWhile the rhetoric sounds innocuous , everything we \u2019 ve witnessed over the last 24 months proves beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health \u2019 planning has little to do with the health of the individual and more about how the individual can be more effectively managed to serve the collective , that in turn is to be administered by the new technocracy .\nThe WEF is merely the latest avatar for this elitist ideology whose primary goal is always to meet the ruling oligarchy \u2019 s financial and consolidation goals and objectives .\nThis was true 100 years ago as it is today .\nJust as with the global financial crash in 2008 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses through gargantuan government bailouts , so too will elites seek to consolidate their baronial individual asset wealth portfolios and privileged asset classes while demanding infinite self-sacrifice for everyone else \u2013 all for the greater good , of course .\nIt is also about managing expectations , as the WEF states : \u201c The Great Narrative Meeting [ in November 2021 ] is a linchpin of the Great Narrative initiative , a collaborative effort of the world \u2019 s leading thinkers to fashion longer-term perspectives and co-create a narrative that can help guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclusive and sustainable vision for our collective future.\n\u201d You might be asking : what is their endgame ?\nPut simply , every new world order needs a financial reset , and in the WEF \u2019 s Great Reset , the plan is to intentionally overinflate and collapse the current fiat money system , reimagined and replaced by a new globalised economic system backed by a new superficial asset class under the guise of the \u201c financialisation of nature.\n\u201d That plan gained a significant foothold in October 2021 when the Rockefeller Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creation of a new asset class that will effectively monetise the natural world as well as the processes underpinning all life .\nAll in the name of \u201c sustainability.\n\u201d The lifeblood of this system will be a new Central Bank Digital Currency ( CBDC ) which will be fully programmable , meaning that the currency issuer can stipulate how the digital money is spent .\nThis is the highest form of social engineering conceivable and can become the payment mechanism for Universal Basic Income , allowing the government issuer power over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It could limit your transactions to green spending and \u2018 carbon-neutral \u2019 activities .\nIt \u2019 s also a system designed to eliminate upward mobility unless you gain promotion through the political economy .\nIt could lead to the ultimate victory of the technocracy .\nHowever , its Achilles heel might be that it seeks to remake the world in such a short space of time , presumably so these masters of the universe can marvel at their \u2018 remarkable achievements \u2019 in this lifetime \u2013 the ultimate act of hubris by these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technocracy movement first emerged in the early 20th century , contemporary thinkers raised the alarm that pseudo-intellectualism and the mechanised worldview augured an eventual collapse of western civilisation .\nThe timeframe wasn \u2019 t clear , only that it was inevitable .\nIn his historical literary work , The Decline of the West ( 1928 ) , Oswald Spengler described the event horizon that eventually consumes all major cultures , and which generally have a limited lifespan of roughly one thousand years .\nHe examined eight major civilisations as examples : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Greco-Roman , Mayan-Aztec , Arabian , and European-Western .\nHe envisioned the West being consumed by its intellectual vortex : Today we live so cowed under the bombardment of this intellectual artillery , the media , that hardly anyone can attain to the inward detachment that is required for a clear view of the monstrous drama .\nThe will-to-power operating under a pure democratic disguise has finished off its masterpiece so well that the object \u2019 s sense of freedom is actually flattered by the most thorough-going enslavement that has ever existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe unconstrained vision of Davos elites may become the final revolution within a larger civilisational cycle .\nThe Covid-19 pseudo-pandemic would be one of the catalysing events in this process , followed by global cyberwar , and then finally ending in something more outrageous like a nuclear conflagration before ushering in a New World Order .\nSuch a protracted multi-phased upheaval would mark the end of the main features of modern western civilisation : the post-Westphalian nation-state , the era of enlightenment and rational thought , self-governing democracy and republican forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Zbigniew Brzezinski called a Technetronic Era .\nCompared to the 20th century , this would more resemble a centralised command and control economy and a highly automated society .\nIn terms of individual rights , it would look like a neo-feudal dark age .\nThis cycle was discussed by American writers William Strauss and Neil Howe in their book The Fourth Turning ( 1997 ) , which illustrated how the development of Anglo-American society is a feature of a much larger centuries-old cycle .\nOr , as Italian commentator Federico Dezzanidescribes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own tail over the span of a century , Anglo-American societies are born , grow , mature and die , only to rise again and begin a new cycle.\n\u201d In the end , it all comes back to Malthus \u2013 Malthusianism \u2013 which is ultimately the ideological standard hoisted by the likes of Schwab , Bill Gates , Stanley Johnson , Prince Charles , and globalist outfits like the Trilateral Commission .\nThese elites believe that the people must bear the brunt of this epic existential predicament of an overcrowded planet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and his industrial exploits , which is said to be driving anthropogenic global warming to the point where Earth will be uninhabitable .\nTo save humanity from itself , we must be forced to accept that there are too many of us , so we play their globalist game of musical chairs .\nWe know what they mean , but they won \u2019 t state their intentions openly , not yet anyway .\nOnly it \u2019 s not true .\nIn Plato \u2019 s Republic , in the dialogue of the myth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Socrates explains that to maintain order and social continuity , the ruling class must act under the aegis of \u201c the noble lie.\n\u201d This is based on the belief that from time to time , the ruling class must feed the general populace an ennobling fiction to maintain order and continuity .\nThe noble lie is noble because it benefits the soul of the person who believes it .\nFrom an elite \u2019 s perspective , this is done for their own good and that they might feel better about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about our living memory , or what happened in the West over the last half-century , it \u2019 s been a continuum of such lies , although hardly noble : the assassination of JFK , the Gulf of Tonkin incident , Saddam \u2019 s WMDs , 19 Arab hijackers on 9/11 , spreading freedom and democracy in Afghanistan , overpopulation , climate chaos , Trump-Russian collusion , Covid-19 , the Great Reset , and soon it will be the coming war on China .\nEach epic yarn spun with the help of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propaganda and misinformation .\nBy brainwashing the population incessantly , the establishment creates the illusion of a \u2018 bottom-up consensus \u2019 , so much so that the people believe they \u2019 ve collectively arrived at a grassroots consensus .\nDrifting out noble lies in the 21st century has become a pretty efficient process with the consensus enforced by digital dragnet : dare oppose any noble liedeployed by the globalist caste for your own good to \u2018 reimagine \u2019 and reorganise socio-economic systems , and you \u2019 re treated the same as a blasphemer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , banished from view , and no longer permitted to speak in the public commons .\nDeplatformed , depersoned , cancelled .\nAt the same time , however , a very real great awakening is also taking hold with a rising level of political and conscious awareness much broader and wide-ranging than anything before in human history .\nThis is a consequence of the same global panopticon wielded against the people by the elites .\nSuch awareness is the prerequisite to ultimate liberation , or as philosopher G.I .\nGurdjieff once said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prison , the first thing you must do is realise that you are in prison .\nIf you think you are free , you can \u2019 t escape.\n\u201d Which brings us back to the philosophical and existential question : why are we here ?\nWhat is the purpose of humans on this planet ?\nDarwinian genetic science says we are here to promulgate our genes and advance the species .\nOn a fundamental level , this is what makes us human .\nBut the new green technocracy says this is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher truth \u2013 a new altruism imbued in the Great Reset doctrine .\nThe irony is that collectively speaking , humanity might not survive this new \u2018 empty planet \u2019 initiative .\nElite technocrats will contend that only a planned society modelled after Huxley \u2019 s vision of a technocracy organised by functional castes and selective breeding in vitro can save the planet from the alleged existential menace of human consumption and climate change .\nWhose compelling future is this ?\nIs this not the \u2018 scientific dictatorship \u2019 that H.G .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ run by an elite committee of scientists and technocrats who hold the reins of power over every aspect of life and dictate how society is organised and run minute to minute ?\nThis is unconstrained totalitarianism .\nUnder such a system , the individual will have no agency , no conscience , and eventually no soul .\nThe last 250 years have been an extraordinary progression from monarchies to democratic nations , in which the state eventually assumed a god-like status .\nIt set the stage for what is heading towards us now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one-world unified state .\nFar from being its crowning victory , this crescendo of technocracy and the perversion of \u2018 progress \u2019 exposes how materialism and the scientific priesthood can not satisfactorily answer the fundamental questions we \u2019 ve asked since time immemorial , those eternal questions and divine mysteries pursued by monks , sages , and sannyasi .\nThe forces of modernity can not resolve this predicament , so people are left searching for something more grounded \u2013 where through the natural world they may also know the supernatural .\nOnce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirituality to find meaning and purpose , including ( and not surprising as one may think ) the younger generation .\nWe should be under no illusion about the challenges lying before us .\nBut even beyond an awareness of what you face , you need to have a vision of a world you wish to live in .\nElites have always been adept at occupying the minds of the people with propaganda , and the latest war or catastrophe , so we never settle long enough to formulate our vision of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is mired in a never-ending procession of reactive emotions , leaving us vulnerable to the power of suggestion \u2013 and a \u2018 compelling future \u2019 is instead continually served up to us by our rulers .\nThey create the problem ( a noble lie ) that elicits our reaction before they present us with a solution to which there is usually no alternative .\nMake no mistake : the great and the good in Davos are busy designing your \u2018 compelling future \u2019 , and if no other counter-narrative is offered , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s that simple .\nQui tacet consentit .\nTranslated : your silence is your consent .\nThere is still much work to be done , but the work is never done .\nThroughout time , this has always been the case .\nThe more things change , the more they are the same .\n2 .\nWall Street \u2019 s New Asset Class Will Put Natural World \u2018 Up for

has down-regulated a bit , the impacts of what we \u2019 ve been through will continue to affect us indefinitely .\nBecause Covid was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to survive an illness .\nIt was about changing the structure and nature of government .\nAbout changing laws and rolling out new programs and institutions to better \u2018 protect \u2019 us in the future .\nIt was about compounding the

Past the Threshold \u2013 Understanding These Critical Times", "content": "We are moving into significant times , and I feel it will be critical how we come to understand and perceive what is to come .\nHow we frame the external \u2018 happenings \u2019 that continue to erupt across the world will decide how we respond and cope with the effects .\nA few days ago , I posted a message on my Telegram channel .\nI wrote the following : The more I observe external events unfolding , the more I perceive predictive programming at work .\nWhen we read or hear something in the mainstream media , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to \u2018 tell \u2019 us how things are \u2013 according to a set narrative .\nMainstream narratives are programs , psychological manipulations , and often outright lies .\nWe are given these narratives to program our beliefs .\nOur beliefs then create our perceptions , and our perceptions create our experiences .\nUltimately , we experience the world according to the narratives that we are given .\nThis creates a loop \u2013 and many people remain in this \u2018 perception loop.\n\u2019 In the coming days , weeks , and months , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unease , and discomfort .\nWe need to step away from them .\nWe have to disentangle ourselves from the external programs and manufactured narratives .\nIt is essential we step out of the lower frequencies of unrest and instability \u2013 and find our inner grounding .\nWe can do better than this .\nWhy did I write this ?\nBecause I feel that the times ahead are going to be increasingly chaotic , and it is important that we do not get caught up in these disruptive energies .\nEverything external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dragging our attention outwards and away from ourselves .\nAnd this not only makes us more attached to external events and occurrences , but also weakens our inner balance .\nNow is the time to be grounded and stable .\nAnd to see clearly that what are operating in the physical realm right now are only \u2018 shadows.\n\u2019 They are the shadows of an older world , an older regime of power that is struggling with its last desperate breaths as a new revolution of understanding emerges .\nIt is our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaging with them , for they shall also allow us to gain our sovereignty , inner freedom , and comprehension of the bigger picture .\nI haven \u2019 t dipped into the Old Testament for decades ( nor have I fully read it ) , yet this quote fell across my radar as I was writing this newsletter .\nIn Ephesians 6:12 it was written that : \u201c For our struggle is not against enemies of blood and flesh , but against the rulers , against the authorities , against the cosmic powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places \u201d The human struggle has been a long one , and continues to be so , for the path to perceptive awakening/awareness is not a daisy-strewn walk .\nYet I feel that humanity is coming towards a threshold .\nA threshold in perception , awareness , understanding , and realization .\nAnd for this threshold to emerge , a pressure is building .\nI was speaking yesterday ( 22nd September ) to my friend and colleague who receives the ABE messages ( Nicola ) about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a \u2018 nudge \u2019 from ABE with the following communication : And this message also mentions the \u2018 loop pattern \u2019 that some people are finding themselves in , which I had referred to in my Telegram message .\nI feel there is a different pattern emerging \u2013 different , that is , from the loop pattern .\nAnd this is one of a build up of chaotic energies that are needed to push us over a tipping point threshold .\nThis is the same process/mechanism that occurs in complex systems ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincidence \u2019 that I did my PhD on social complex systems\u2026 ?\n? )\n.\nIn a complex system , as it develops , expands , and takes on greater complexity , it often reaches a stage known as a \u2018 tipping point.\n\u2019 At this stage , the system can go one of two ways : it can either breakthrough or breakdown .\nIn order to breakthrough , the system needs to gain an extra amount of energy to push it through the threshold .\nYet as this extra energy emerges within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaos .\nThis energetic disruption is sometimes called a \u2018 chaotic disruptor \u2019 or \u2018 chaos attractor \u2019 as , like a vortex , it attracts more energy to it , thus fuelling its energetic state .\nEventually , this energy reaches its own tipping point where it feeds into the complex system , pushing it past the threshold into a new recombination : a newly ordered complex system of greater stability and order .\nIf this \u2018 push \u2019 is not reached , the chaotic energy instead activates a breakdown of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of complex systems ) .\nAnother way to frame this is that humanity can go through the portal ( threshold ) , or fall into the hole ( breakdown ) .\nThis is exactly how White Eagle of the Hopi Indigenous tells it .\nThis is his advice : \u201c This moment humanity is going through can now be seen as a portal and as a hole .\nThe decision to fall into the hole or go through the portal is up to you .\nIf you repent of the problem and consume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with little energy , nervous all the time , with pessimism , you will fall into the hole .\nBut if you take this opportunity to look at yourself , rethink life and death , take care of yourself and others , you will cross the portal .\nTake care of your homes , take care of your body .\nConnect with your spiritual House .\nWhen you are taking care of yourselves , you are taking care of everything else .\nDo not lose the spiritual dimension of this crisis ; have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole ; see more broadly .\nThere is a social demand in this crisis , but there is also a spiritual demand \u2014 the two go hand in hand .\nWithout the social dimension , we fall into fanaticism .\nBut without the spiritual dimension , we fall into pessimism and lack of meaning .\nYou were prepared to go through this crisis .\nTake your toolbox and use all the tools available to you .\nLearn about the resistance of the indigenous and African peoples ; we have always been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we still haven \u2019 t stopped singing , dancing , lighting a fire , and having fun .\nDon \u2019 t feel guilty about being happy during this difficult time .\nYou do not help at all being sad and without energy .\nYou help if good things emanate from the Universe now .\nIt is through joy that one resists .\nAlso , when the storm passes , each of you will be very important in the reconstruction of this new world .\nYou need to be well and strong .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ other way than to maintain a beautiful , happy , and bright vibration .\nThis has nothing to do with alienation .\nThis is a resistance strategy .\nIn shamanism , there is a rite of passage called the quest for vision .\nYou spend a few days alone in the forest , without water , without food , without protection .\nWhen you cross this portal , you get a new vision of the world , because you have faced your fears , your difficulties .\nThis is what is asked of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this time to perform your vision-seeking rituals .\nWhat world do you want to build for you ?\nFor now , this is what you can do \u2014 serenity in the storm .\nCalm down , pray every day .\nEstablish a routine to meet the sacred every day .\nGood things emanate ; what you emanate now is the most important thing .\nAnd sing , dance , resist through art , joy , faith , and

\u2019 ve been waiting for .\nIdleness makes you mere kindling ; boldness makes you a force of nature to contend with .\nIf , as Steve Jobs advised , \u201c remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you use death as a guide for redeeming your life .\nBecause you are going to die .\nMaybe not today .\nMaybe not tomorrow .\nBut someday you will be pushing up daisies along with every other human being who has ever existed .\nThe question is : will it be death by boredom and banality pining for a savior , or death by passion and curiosity becoming your own savior ?\nYou have from this day until the day you die to live the life you want to live .\nYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life .\nYou might as well make it a heroic life .\nYou had an eternity before you existed to do nothing .\nYou \u2019 ll have an eternity after you exist to do nothing .\nNow is your time to actually do something , to find something you love to do and then use it to save your life .\nPlace the oxygen mask on yourself before assisting others : Focus on you until the focus is on you , then focus on the world .\nThe best way to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crashing plane .\nIn the crashing plane that is your life , you must be capable of putting the oxygen mask ( health ) on yourself before assisting others .\nOnce you have your mask set right , you can begin attempting to set the world right .\nIf you attempt to set the world right without your oxygen mask on , you risk not being able to help because you can \u2019 t function .\nYou risk ill-health and incompetence .\nYou risk death before your time .\nWith your oxygen mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the health and confidence needed to engage the world with strength and vitality .\nYou will be a force to be reckoned with .\nSuch a force can bring balance to an otherwise imbalanced world .\nSuch a force can even prevent the plane from crashing before its time .\nSeen in this light , you can see how there is a virtue in selfishness .\nFor it is selfishness with good intent .\nThe selfishness of putting the oxygen mask on yourself leads to the selflessness of helping others do the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confidence up ; conceit down .\nChin up ; foot down .\nSelf-esteem leads to prestige when you use it toward the wellbeing of others and to ground the world in health .\nBe counteractive with answers and proactive with questions : Sometimes saving yourself means freeing yourself from what has been preventing you from flourishing .\nOften what prevents you from flourishing is not so obvious .\nIt can be as simple as an outdated law or as complex as a limited worldview .\nParadoxically , the only way to know for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from flourishing is to not be sure .\nIronically , when you \u2019 re not sure of anything , you free yourself to be sure of what \u2019 s possible and what \u2019 s not .\nThis is because when you sacrifice certainty , you resurrect curiosity .\nYou get out in front of what you think you know so that what you don \u2019 t know can at least potentially become knowable .\nThis requires a questioning disposition .\nIt requires the ability to face an \u201c answer \u201d with credulity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c entertain a thought without accepting it.\n\u201d It requires the fortitude to cut through orthodoxy with an unorthodox sword .\nIn the spirit of becoming your own savior , there is perhaps nothing more powerful than questioning the answers that came before you .\nNothing is more powerful than an unorthodox question mark planted over an orthodox period .\nThe questioner is the redeemer .\nFor what must be redeemed is the Truth Quest itself , and it is redeemed from the trap of the so-called \u201c truth.\n\u201d In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaos : What does it mean to be authentic chaos in a world full of toxic positivity ?\nIt means recognizing when comfort has become a prison and acting in such a way that you break free and stretch your comfort zone .\nIt means recognizing when a lifejacket has become a limitation to swimming .\nIt means casting security aside so that courage can be self-actualized .\nIt means realizing that there \u2019 s more happiness in a spoonful of hard-earned self-improvement than in an ocean-full of easy self-affirmation .\nAuthentic chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current order to alchemize a higher order .\nIt \u2019 s controlled anarchy like the native American concept of counting coup .\nIt \u2019 s the personification of a social leveling mechanism that levels the playing field of all finite games while introducing the higher perspective of the Infinite Game of life .\nMore importantly , authentic chaos is a deep reconnecting to our primal nature .\nIt \u2019 s a vital hard reset into sacred alignment .\nIt \u2019 s becoming a force of nature first and a person second .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ primacy of the unwritten law of the interconnected cosmos .\nSelf-as-world and world-as-self becomes the supreme perspective .\nEgocentrism is trumped by eco-centrism .\nOne-dimensional independence is subsumed by multidimensional interdependence .\nThe world opens , the fountainhead overflows , the Philosopher \u2019 s Stone reveals itself , as the authentic chaos of the individuated cuts through toxic positivity like a hot blade through cold butter .\nOne powerful way to listen to your own truth is to practice fait sur mesure .\nWhich is French for \u2018 made to your measure.\n\u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savior is realizing when what your culture has given you is not to your measure and then having the courage to create a way of living that is to your measure .\nThis means accepting that you are the only benchmark for your life .\nYou are the measure .\nNobody else can determine what is or is not to your measure .\nOnly you have the power to either remain a culturally conditioned cog or to become a courageously reconditioned catalyst .\nDon \u2019 t fall into the trap of following someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyze , and scrutinize their plan , then improvise it .\nStand on the shoulders of giants .\nCustomize your life to your own

Global Freedom Would Perish", "content": "In a televised interview with ABC \u2019 s Mike Wallace in 1958 , author of the seminal classic Brave New World , Aldous Huxley laid out his rather grim vision for the future of the human race in a prescient and timeless warning for us to wake up .\nAfter having lived through the bloodbaths of World War I and II and in the early stages of the nuclear cold war , he discussed the problems of freedom and survival in America , making a number of predictions more relevant today , nearly 60 years later , than ever before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third world war which will certain bring about a nuclear holocaust , Huxley \u2019 s message is more important than ever because it serves as a reminder that a critically thinking individual is the truest and most formidable weapon against the destructive and psychopathic tendencies of tyrants .\nThe following 6 predictions taken from this interview were exceptionally farsighted at the time , and are presented here as an amplification of Huxley \u2019 s imperative that we all must wake up to the truth of how power is misused in our world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Television Would be Used to Enslave Us HUXLEY : As technology becomes more and more complicated , it becomes necessary to have more and more elaborate organizations , more hierarchical organizations , and incidentally the advance of technology is being accompanied by an advance in the science of organization .\nIt \u2019 s now possible to make organizations on a larger scale than it was ever possible before , and so that you have more and more people living their lives out as subordinates in these hierarchical systems controlled by bureaucracy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bureaucracies of big government .\nHUXLEY : Hitler used terror on the one kind , brute force on the one hand , but he also used a very efficient form of propaganda , which er\u2026he was using every modern device at that time .\nHe didn \u2019 t have TV.\n, but he had the radio which he used to the fullest extent , and was able to impose his will on an immense mass of people .\nI mean , the Germans were a highly educated people .\nWALLACE : Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , but how do we equate Hitler \u2019 s use of propaganda with the way that propaganda , if you will , is used let us say here in the United States .\nAre you suggesting that there is a parallel ?\nHUXLEY : Needless to say it is not being used this way now , but , er\u2026the point is , it seems to me , that there are methods at present available , methods superior in some respects to Hitler \u2019 s method , which could be used in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel very strongly is that we mustn \u2019 t be caught by surprise by our own advancing technology .\nThis has happened again and again in history with technology \u2019 s advance and this changes social condition , and suddenly people have found themselves in a situation which they didn \u2019 t foresee and doing all sorts of things they really didn \u2019 t want to do .\nWALLACE : And well , what\u2026what do you mean ?\nDo you mean that we develop our television but we don \u2019 t know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the point that you \u2019 re making ?\nHUXLEY : Well , at the present the television , I think , is being used quite harmlessly ; it \u2019 s being used , I think , I would feel , it \u2019 s being used too much to distract everybody all the time .\nBut , I mean , imagine which must be the situation in all communist countries where the television , where it exists , is always saying the same things the whole time ; it \u2019 s always driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide front of distraction it \u2019 s creating a one-pointed , er\u2026drumming in of a single idea , all the time .\nIt \u2019 s obviously an immensely powerful instrument .\nWALLACE : Uh-huh .\nSo you \u2019 re talking about the potential misuse of the instrument .\nHUXLEY : Exactly .\nWe have , of course\u2026all technology is in itself moral and neutral .\nThese are just powers which can either be used well or ill ; it is the same thing with atomic energy , we can either use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it as a substitute for the coal and the oil which are running out .\n2 . )\nAdvertising Will Bypass Rationality and Capture the Mind \u2019 s of Children HUXLEY : \u2026advertisement plays a very necessary role , but the danger it seems to me in a democracy is this\u2026I mean what does a democracy depend on ?\nA democracy depends on the individual voter making an intelligent and rational choice for what he regards as his enlightened self-interest , in any given circumstance .\nBut what these people are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their particular purposes , for selling goods and the dictatorial propagandists are for doing , is to try to bypass the rational side of man and to appeal directly to these unconscious forces below the surfaces so that you are , in a way , making nonsense of the whole democratic procedure , which is based on conscious choice on rational ground .\nWALLACE : Of course , well , maybe\u2026I\u2026you have just answered this next question because in your essay you write about television commercials , not just political commercials , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you put it , \u201c Today \u2019 s children walk around singing beer commercials and toothpaste commercials.\n\u201d And then you link this phenomenon in some way with the dangers of a dictatorship .\nNow , could you spell out the connection or , have\u2026or do you feel you \u2019 ve done so sufficiently ?\nHUXLEY : Well , I mean , here , this whole question of children , I think , is a terribly important one because children are quite clearly much more suggestible than the average grownup ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one reason or another all the propaganda was in the hands of one or very few agencies , you would have an extraordinarily powerful force playing on these children , who after all are going to grow up and be adults quite soon .\nI do think that this is not an immediate threat , but it remains a possible threat , and\u2026 WALLACE : You said something to the effect in your essay that the children of Europe used to be called \u2018 cannon fodder \u2019 and here in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 HUXLEY : Well , after all , you can read in the trade journals the most lyrical accounts of how necessary it is , to get hold of the children because then they will be loyal brand buyers later on .\nBut I mean , again you just translate this into political terms , the dictator says they all will be ideology buyers when they are grownup .\n3 . )\nThe Rise of Dictatorship Based on Terrorism HUXLEY : I think this kind of dictatorship of the future , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we \u2019 ve been familiar with in the immediate past .\nI mean , take another book prophesying the future , which was a very remarkable book , George Orwell \u2019 s \u201c 1984.\n\u201d Well , this book was written at the height of the Stalinist regime , and just after the Hitler regime , and there he foresaw a dictatorship using entirely the methods of terror , the methods of physical violence .\nNow , I think what is going to happen in the future is that dictators will find , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can do everything with bayonets except sit on them !\n4 . )\nThe Pharmacological Revolution Will Make Us Love Slavery HUXLEY : \u2026this is the\u2026 the pharmacological revolution which is taking place , that we have now powerful mind-changing drugs which physiologically speaking are almost costless .\nI mean they are not like opium or like coca\u2026cocaine , which do change the state of mind but leave terrible results physiologically and morally .\n\u2026if you want to preserve your power indefinitely , you have to get the consent of the ruled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by drugs as I foresaw in \u201c Brave New World , \u201d partly by these new techniques of propaganda .\nThey will do it by bypassing the sort of rational side of man and appealing to his subconscious and his deeper emotions , and his physiology even , and so , making him actually love his slavery .\nI mean , I think , this is the danger that actually people may be , in some ways , happy under the new regime , but that they will be happy in situations where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2026We know , there is enough evidence now for us to be able , on the basis of this evidence and using certain amount of creative imagination , to foresee the kind of uses which could be made by people of bad will with these things and to attempt to forestall this\u2026 5 . )\nPolitical Candidates Would Become Merchandise Marketed by Professionals WALLACE : You write in Enemies of Freedom , you write specifically about the United States .\nYou say this , writing about American political campaigns you say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a candidate who can be coached to look sincere ; political principles and plans for specific action have come to lose most of their importance .\nThe personality of the candidate , the way he is projected by the advertising experts , are the things that really matter.\n\u201d HUXLEY : Well , this is the\u2026during the last campaign , there was a great deal of this kind of statement by the advertising managers of the campaign parties .\nThis idea that the candidates had to be merchandised as though they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to depend entirely on the personality .\nI mean , personality is important , but there are certainly people with an extremely amiable personality , particularly on TV , who might not necessarily be very good in political\u2026positions of political trust .\nWALLACE : Well , do you feel that men like Eisenhower , Stevenson , Nixon , with knowledge aforethought were trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the American public ?\nHUXLEY : No , but they were being advised by powerful advertising agencies who were making campaigns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made before .\nand I think we shall see probably , er\u2026all kinds of new devices coming into the picture .\nI mean , for example , this thing which got a good deal of publicity last autumn , subliminal projection .\nWALLACE : And we \u2019 ll be persuaded to vote for a candidate that we do not know that we are being persuaded to vote for .\nHUXLEY : Exactly , I mean this is the rather alarming picture that you \u2019 re being persuaded below the level of choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People Will Take Advantage of Technology and Government to Gain Power WALLACE : The question , of course , that keeps coming back to my mind is this : obviously politics in themselves are not evil , television is not in itself evil , atomic energy is not evil , and yet you seem to fear that it will be used in an evil way .\nWhy is it that the right people will not , in your estimation , use them ?\nWhy is it that the wrong people will use these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nHUXLEY : Well , I think one of the reasons is that these are all instruments for obtaining power , and obviously the passion for power is one of the most moving passions that exists in man ; and after all , all democracies are based on the proposition that power is very dangerous and that it is extremely important not to let any one man or any one small group have too much power for too long a time .\nAfter all what are the British and American Constitution except devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new devices are extremely efficient instruments for the imposition of power by small groups over larger masses .\nThis interview was recorded 27 years after the publication of Brave New World , which

"title": "How Real Mind Control Works", "content": "When people are confronted with the idea of \u201c mind control \u201d they often think of something out of television or film media ; a lone prisoner tortured , chemically dazed and conditioned into a hollow zombie as his captors squeeze information from him or use him to complete a task he would not normally do or morally accept .\nAnd while there is actually some truth to this kind of Hollywood depiction , as is evidenced in the exposure of government programs like MK Ultra , the most insidious forms of mind control are far more subtle .\nGovernments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily need to physically cage , drug and brutalize people in order to influence how they behave .\nAll they need to do is manage their perceptions , expectation and assumptions .\nThis can be accomplished with large portions of the public , rather than one person at a time .\nThe elites have always been fascinated with the idea of mass hypnotism .\nIn the 18th century Franz Mesmer was famous for entertaining European royalty with displays of what he called \u201c animal magnetism \u201d , which included what we now know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mesmerism has since become synonymous with the attempt to befuddle people and dictate their actions while in a kind of trance .\nHypnotism is still a very active subject in psychiatric circles and the US government took avid interest in hypnotism as a weapon during their MK Ultra experiments in the 1950s .\nPeople involved in the field of hypnotism are quick to point out that a hypnotized person can not be made to do something that goes against their code of ethics , but this is not exactly the whole story .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ chooses to follow ( or refuses to follow ) while in a trance state , however , what if they can be convinced ( or fooled ) through hypnosis into believing that a particular action is in their best interest in spite of their moral code or sense of self preservation ?\nThis type of control over a subject can and has been accomplished in hypnotic therapy , and examples of \u201c covert \u201d hypnotherapy are also on record , including the example of an Ohio divorce attorney that used covert hypnotism against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using it against some court employees to disarm their psyches and then rape them without memory of the incident .\nAbout two thirds of any given population are capable of being hypnotized to varying degrees .\nStanford University has been avidly searching for a brain pattern that acts as a fingerprint for those that are more prone to hypnotic influence , and they believe they have found certain factors involving areas of the brain that handle heightened focus and attention .\nReduced peripheral awareness also helps to increase the subject \u2019 s vulnerability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These conditions can in fact be encouraged in large crowds of people .\nConsider this for a moment \u2013 What daily activity is the average person involved in that hyperfocuses their attention on a single point in space for long periods of time and removes almost all of their peripheral awareness ?\nIf you said \u201c cell phone use \u201d then you win a chicken dinner .\nBeyond creating an artificial and constant low dose of dopamine in the human brain leading to addiction , cell phones and other small electronic devices actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hypnotized as they rip them away from all peripheral awareness and make them highly suggestible to those who know how to use covert methods .\nTo reiterate , a hypnotic state can be induced in large groups of people for extended periods of time with the correct long term stimulus .\nWatch here as mentalist Darren Brown hypnotizes or \u201c brainwashes \u201d an entire shopping mall of people into raising their hands exactly when he wants them to without them being aware of why they are doing it .\nNotice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHypnotic suggestions last as long as the subjects continue to believe that the suggestions are correct .\nHypnotism is essentially an agreement between the hypnotist and the persons being hypnotized that a particular belief is true ( even if it is not ) .\nIn the case of a victim of an attack , the person may want to believe that the traumatic event did not happen , and thus they can be convinced through hypnosis to forget it .\nIn the case of a group of people , the hypnotist would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they all share and WANT to believe is real , and then exploit it .\nI think some of the political applications of this are obvious .\nThe false left/right paradigm is a perfect Petri dish for obtaining or manufacturing the consent of the masses to be hypnotized .\nThey WANT to believe that their team , which they have willingly joined , is the correct team and that the leadership of that team has their best interests at heart .\nThey want to believe that the actions of their party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always rational and morally sound .\nAnd , even when the leaders of their party do things which are completely contrary to the beliefs and morals of the people who make up the party , those people still want to believe that there must be some logical reason behind these decisions that they do not yet grasp .\nBeyond this , the threat of the \u201c other party \u201d or team is an ever constant stimulus in the form of fear .\nWe watch the scripted battles of these two fabricated teams play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet nothing ever really changes except that the global elites grow more powerful .\nStill , many people actually believe these battles to be real , and invest immense amounts of energy and focus into them as if the fate of the world is being decided within the antics of a political soap opera .\nWhen people are afraid or hyperfocused on an outside threat , they once again become more suggestible .\nThis is why mainstream political discussions focus less on understanding of the threat ( the \u201c How \u201d and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on perpetuating the threat .\nWith understanding of the enemy ( or false enemy ) , the threat can be assessed and fear is reduced , even if the threat is real .\nWithout understanding , fear only increases .\nPolitical powers seek to constantly remind us that threats exist without allowing us the benefit of context .\nThey do not want us to have an in-depth knowledge of the mechanics behind the threats .\nWe are told that our system works in a particular way that seems logical , but it only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want to believe that the system functions as we were taught .\nWe have to have blind faith that what we were initially told was absolutely true .\nThe question is , why should we ?\nIsn \u2019 t it better to remain skeptical of most things and to study what is handed to us ?\nIf we \u2019 re given a strange elixir by an utter stranger and we \u2019 re told to \u201c drink up !\n\u201d , would we not question what \u2019 s in the frothing brew and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigate ?\nIn the case of information and proclamations some people would not investigate , because it is more comfortable to believe the lies , or perhaps because they will be rewarded for going along with the status quo .\nOnly when we become willing to sacrifice comfort , when we stop wanting to accept everything we are told at face value and start questioning the reality that is handed to us , only then will the mass hypnosis we were once influenced by lose its power .\nThe hypnosis of the elites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulation in order to keep the public entranced .\nThe creation of fear and confusion is vital to the execution of mass mind control , and this is a factor that many people absolutely refuse to recognize or take into consideration .\nThe idea that the elites would build a system only to then deliberately destroy it is just too much for many to fathom .\nBut again , what better way to hyperfocus an entire population and make them malleable to suggestions that they would not normally consider otherwise ?\nIn past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of similarities between global elitist groups and the behaviors and character traits of narcissistic sociopaths ( also known as narcopaths or psychopaths ) .\nI have even theorized that globalists are actually a highly organized group of narcopaths who recruit other narcopaths into the fold .\nMany high-level narcopaths are intuitively knowledgeable on the dynamics of suggestibility and the human psyche .\nI would call this their primary survival trait .\nNarcopaths are well known for creating confusion around them in order to gain control of the people in their lives or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also known for being willing to build up certain routines and acclimating people around them to a particular environment , only to suddenly disrupt it all as a means to stun their victims and create subservience .\nIt is important to realize that these people do NOT necessarily care about stability .\nIn fact , they often will actively sabotage stability to obtain something they care about more \u2013 control .\nThe strategies that individual narcopaths exhibit on a small scale are simply magnified thousands of times when we talk about the behaviors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider themselves rational are hard pressed to comprehend this kind of behavior , but there is a devious tactical logic to it .\nMind control of others can be achieved by keeping those people infinitely off-balance .\nConjuring moments of tenuous peace , and then striking with cycles of unpredictable crisis .\nBefore we know it , many years of instability have gone by and the organized narcopaths in power have gained even more control .\nWe wonder where all that time went , and why we were not able to change things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypnotized into inaction , or the wrong actions in the name of meaningless political stagecraft .\nReal mind control and mass hypnosis requires , as already mentioned , our consent , but it is consent that is conned out of us .\nIt is conned out of us by fake leaders with intentions and actions that do not match their promises .\nIt is conned out of us by a system that breeds conformity of thought and tells us that those who think outside the widely accepted norm are aberrant and \u201c crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us by our own weaknesses \u2013 our desire to go along to get along , our fear of confronting the crowd and telling them they are wrong , our fear of losing what we think is stability , or our fear of being on our own .\nReal mind control is not about torture and force , it is about quietly induced acceptance .\nWe can remove our consent from the hypnotists anytime we wish , but we have to be willing to stop ignoring certain realities .\nWe have to be willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we recognize we have been conned and controlled in the past , and we have to revel in our ability to refuse to conform .\nIt must become a part of who we are \u2013 the people who do not take what we are told at face value .\nThe people that question almost everything .\nThe people who can not be mesmerized .\nBrandon Smith is the founder of Alt-Market is an organization designed to help you find like-minded

to be alive , and depending on how you \u2019 re handling it , you could see a blessing or a curse .\nEither you learn to laugh at the insanity and absurdity of it all , or you pay the price and lurch around in the manufactured anxiety , worry , concern , uncertainty , and fear of it all , like so many others .\nIneffective , without purpose or passion , and forfeiting your chance to experience the inner freedom , ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wonder that bring joy to life .\nThe choice is easy , although , the task itself may seem impossible .\nWe have to do what no other generations of humans have had to do .\nOur ancestors didn \u2019 t have to maneuver around in a frequency prison .\nThey didn \u2019 t have to maintain constant vigilance against the hypnotic effects of mass media .\nThey didn \u2019 t have to exert such total command over their impulses just to avoid being distracted by meaningless shit .\nPhysical weakness wasn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their food supply wasn \u2019 t so thoroughly

propaganda , and they didn \u2019 t have to absorb the never-ending firehose of fear , confusion , chaos and violence being muscled into the collective conscience .\nThere is an extreme shift taking place in this world .\nIt \u2019 s a top-down redirection of our natural state of being toward a manufactured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence .\nThe new system is being engineered for efficiency in managing , governing , and controlling people .\nIt \u2019 s a massive technological and systemic usurpation of individual autonomy , made possible by outstanding new technological mechanisms of surveillance and punishment .\nOnly the well-positioned , unelected few residing at the top of this hierarchy will have access to how these systems are used and who are targeted with them .\nIt is a scientific dictatorship .\nThose who don \u2019 t see it are engaging in self-delusion , and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuke it falsely perceive themselves to be in a position to somehow benefit from it .\nChina \u2019 s social credit system is part of it .\nDigital currencies are fast being standardized and already being used as a tool to punish dissent .\nVaccine passports and health-based permissions are now broadly accepted around the globe , as is the idea of mandated medicine .\nSecurity cameras are everywhere and are increasingly being accessed by law enforcement agencies .\nRobots are are being equipped with machine guns and AI targeting systems .\nBig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosquitoes are hailed as improvements upon nature .\nScience itself is replacing all variations of God .\nThe internet is being retrofitted to support censorship and punish free speech , and entertainment media is broadly on message in support of it all .\nThe big plan is publicly called The Great Reset .\nWhen fully congealed the scientific dictatorship will mean that the personal and most intimate details of your life will be used as leverage against you to coerce you into total compliance with the corporate state .\nThis is literally a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t take my word for it .\nConsider those of one the chief architects of this madness , futurist and World Economic Forum advisor , Yuval Noah Harari : If you were to wind back the clock a mere fifty years and toss all of these \u2018 advancements \u2019 in the lap of the ordinary person , they \u2019 d tell you to go jump in the lake , or perhaps more colorfully , to stick it all where the sun don \u2019 t shine .\nThey weren \u2019 t ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t need it in their lives , and they weren \u2019 t interested in the idea of such a grand intrusion into their personal lives , and they would have rejected it .\nThey were human beings being human , which is NOT what we \u2019 re aiming for today .\nToday , however , if you were to put such a grand new design for the world to vote by everyone , the old way would lose .\nDemocracy would murder liberty .\nIt does it all the time .\nSo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to \u2018 acquiescing to whatever they throw at us is awesome ?\n\u201d And why is this important to what you \u2019 re going through today , everyday ?\nYou might look at this new global model as a very extravagant product with a lot of bells and whistles that nobody needs and that really only appeals to the most egotistical , frivolous , and shallow consumer .\nIt obviously makes life more complicated than advertised , and it \u2019 s ridiculously , comically over-priced .\nNo one in their right mind would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt \u2019 s an emotional buy .\nJust like all potentially profitable yet unnecessary products it must be accompanied by an effective marketing and public relations campaign .\nAnd like all good marketing campaigns , it must appeal to high emotion in order to bypass the critical thinking faculties of the consumer \u2019 s mind .\nThe highest of all emotions is fear , and the apex fear is the fear of death .\nThe secondary great fear is the fear of rejection or abandonment , and confusion is the glue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be intelligently confused about product \u2019 s necessity , and they must be made to fear not having it or be made to believe they will be left out if they don \u2019 t get it .\nThe Covid experiment is the finest historical example of this .\nThe fear about it was exaggerated , the messaging didn \u2019 t make sense to the logical mind , and the herd quickly attached their security to authority , creating an intense social pressure to conform .\nMass psychosis .\nThe rules of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight response activated , then the rules were swiftly normalized .\nMost people bought in because of the fear of death or the fear of being ostracized or punished .\nAll the result of an unprecedented global media campaign .\nThe effort to subjugate human consciousness on a mass scale began in earnest over a hundred years ago with the industrial revolution and the mass assimilation of the individual into the corporate structure .\nThis forever altered society , creating leisure time and expendable income for many , and giving rise to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer .\nWith this new consumer revolution came an economy based on the manufacture and consumer goods , which necessitated equally significant advances in marketing .\nEnter Edward Bernays who pioneered modern public relations in the 1920 \u2019 s .\nHe was the nephew of Sigmund Freud , and sought to develop an effective way of influencing how the public perceives a product , brand , or company , by exploiting newly understood facets of human psychology .\nOne of his first successful attempts to change public opinion about an emerging mass-market product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was called \u2018 Torches of Freedom , \u2019 which worked wonders to enslave modern women to the addiction of smoking cigarettes .\nIn the 1940 \u2019 s the greatest mind control weapon ever devised gained traction as the hottest consumer appliance : Television .\nThis brought sophisticated , hypnotic trance inducing messaging directly into the homes and minds of the masses .\nShortly thereafter , subliminal messaging in television programming became standard fare , as demonstrated by this rather crude implementation in the 1950 \u2019 s , in which a video of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around with barely visible scrolling text suggestions .\nThis example employs a fundamental aspect of mind control , which is that the subconscious mind captures and records even that which goes unnoticed by the conscious mind .\nSocial experiments broadening our understanding of group psychology in the \u2019 50 \u2019 s , 60 \u2019 s and \u2019 70 \u2019 s gave us deep insight into what it takes to override one \u2019 s natural tendency to individuate and remain committed to personal values and ideals .\nOne of the most important studies was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coercion is not required to get someone to vote against the evidence of their own eyes .\nInstead of force , the powerful presence of a consenting , albeit self-delusional , majority is enough to trigger cognitive dissonance and internal dishonesty .\nFascinating .\nFast forward fifty years to when 24-hour biases and opinionated news punditry have all but wiped out legitimate journalism and any serious exposure of official corruption .\nIt \u2019 s now normal for even the local news to be completely scripted and overseen by a tiny group of media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conan O \u2019 Brien , of all places , show you just how real this is .\nIt \u2019 s so absurd and so obvious , yet most don \u2019 t seem to care .\nThey still tune in and embrace the fantasy of legitimacy in news , and that \u2019 s because we \u2019 re simply used to it now .\nWe \u2019 ve come to expect it .\nWe \u2019 ve become accustomed to it .\nIt \u2019 s the new normal , and above all else , frightened people revere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is how the scientific dictatorship lands .\nIt \u2019 s a soft landing leading to a hard life .\nIt is occurring gradually , and as a result , very few seem to notice or even care .\nWe adapt to it as just another inevitability on this ball of confusion .\nThe proverbial frog in the pot of boiling water .\nOver time the marketing campaign does its work , the sales pitch wears you down , it all begins to feel normal , and the fear makes it impossible to resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings , which is why there is no shame in researching and developing evermore intrusive ways of accessing and hijacking individual consciousness .\nI saw a great recent example all over mainstream media just the other day .\nAll the respectable news hacks uncritically ran a PR piece for a Russian digital-marketing/satellite company endeavoring to display massive celestial , glowing advertisements against the dark of the night sky over densely populated areas .\nYes , that \u2019 s right , they want to replace the stars to turn a profit .\nYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve got till it \u2019 s gone , as they say .\nHere are some choice quotes from this story , displaying the hubris required to pursue something like this : Yeah if you don \u2019 t want to be cut off from the mystery , inspiration , and wonder of the heavens above , well then , you \u2019 re a hater .\nA hater who doesn \u2019 t get it .\nSo shut up .\nIt \u2019 s berserk , y \u2019 all .\nThe scientific dictatorship is already alive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ve already been convinced of its inevitability , and our psychological means of resistance have been hammered and taken off line .\nWe \u2019 re already on autopilot , absent-mindedly adhering to an ever-expanding code of conduct , because everyone else is doing it so it feels normal .\nWe are going along to get along , even though it so obviously leads to self-destruction .\nColossal self-sabotage .\nWhich leads me to my main point .\nAcquiescing willingly , albeit unconsciously , to harmful policy is an act of self-sabotage .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of controlling pesky rebels like you .\nWhen naturally good and independence-oriented individuals unconsciously and repeatedly make poor decisions for themselves , they are doing the important of work of weakening themselves physically , mentally , emotionally , financially , socially , and spiritually .\nWeakened people don \u2019 t have the strength or courage to say no .\nThey acquiesce because the potential consequences of being ostracized and rejected by the big tribe are too severe .\nIt \u2019 s too dangerous to stand alone when you are weak .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times you know that I \u2019 m personally interested in awakening the power of the individual so that people like YOU can live a life of meaning and influence in your personal sphere .\nAnd after over a decade of publishing and over two decades of searching for truth ,

, pausing , intonation and so on .\nIt \u2019 s hilarious , but at the same time disturbing because it shockingly demonstrates how ideas are forced into the mainstream of today \u2019 s corporate culture .\nHave a look .\nThis always cracks me up .\nNot in a \u2018 ha ha \u2019 sort of way , though , more like in a \u2018 ha ha , aren \u2019 t we gullible , \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The point is , when you see a story being played over and again on various news outlets , you have good reason to believe that the information isn \u2019 t coming to you organically .\nIt \u2019 s not something you really need to know or something that is genuinely relevant to day-to-day life in your community .\nIt \u2019 s the execution of an agenda .\nThe information is being deliberately disseminated to manufacture awareness and recalibrate the standard for normal .\nIt \u2019 s something the corporate media wants you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shell game .\nWhen you understand this fundamental of corporate media , the landscape of information today looks totally different .\nYou \u2019 re able to see narratives unfold and evolve , and able to recognize when your attention is deliberately being drawn towards an issue .\nOr away from an issue .\nHere \u2019 s a few examples from the present that when taken as everyday happenstance may seem benign , but have serious implications for the future of society and for the human race at large .\nThe fact that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days is a red flag that there is some larger agenda in the works .\nThe norms , values and standards in our culture are being tweaked , or twerked , and attacked by the repetition of such information .\nREAD : 11 TACTICS USED BY THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA TO MANUFACTURE CONSENT FOR THE OLIGARCHY Vaccines \u2013 This is perhaps one of the most common issues thrust on the public in order to fabricate widespread public support for a questionable and very profitable practice .\nThe one-sidedness of the debate on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where people now openly demand forced medical procedures on others to alleviate a perceived fear .\nGender Neutrality \u2013 This is the idea that a person \u2019 s biological gender is somehow fluid against their opinion of themselves .\nThere is an apparent effort to make us believe that those with confusion over their gender are horribly oppressed and in danger , and that they need to be protected with censorship and speech laws .\nThe aim here is to promote the virtues of censorship , and to develop a generation of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advancement of the human race , but rather shallow social issues and a perceived sense of justice .\nSex Robots \u2013 Robot sex toys are increasingly being put in front of the public and lauded as the future of companionship .\nNews stories on the latest advancements in robot sex dolls are ubiquitous these days .\nWe are being told they make great life partners and that they sufficiently synthesize the experience of being with a real woman ( or man ) .\nThe end game here is to further disconnect people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assist in a broader depopulation agenda by persuading us that sex with plastic and electronics is as good as or better than the real thing .\nLook for birth rates to decline further as these creepy sex toys become more popular .\nMicrochipping \u2013 Some call this the \u2018 mark of the beast , \u2019 but the idea of microchipping people for their supposed convenience is being pushed out onto all the major media channels as a great way to take part in our technological future .\nIssues of privacy , tyranny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly examined .\nFeature stories on acquiescent corporate employees who willingly take the chip make it seem as though chipping is fashionable .\nThese are just a few examples , but the technique in play here is a fundamental method of social engineering via media .\nAmong the regular flow of info , certain topics or subjects are thrust into public consciousness with regularity .\nThe issues are never quite framed as critically important , but rather positioned as matter-of-fact , sign-of-the-times .\nOpposing arguments or viewpoints are never fully explored .\nFrame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems exciting and cutting edge .\nNormalize it by mixing it in with everyday things , and repeating it .\nMake it seem like the future is here now , and that there is a bandwagon you need to

been shocking and totally unacceptable a few generations ago .\nBut , slowly raise awareness of the wonders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people become curious rather than repulsed .\nIt becomes normalized .\nThere really is nothing you can do about living in such a changing world , except opt-out of the insanity , stupidity and self-destructive tendencies being framed as wholesome cultural advances

personalities are blunted and their bodies and minds configured by a technocracy whose scientists design humans to maximise their outputs for the benefit of the ruling classes .\nOutside the world of fiction , the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) is an umbrella of multibillion-dollar , mostly US-based corporations and billionaires ; a think tank in which the rulers of the world meet to discuss and try to shape the general direction of the global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US , for instance , refusing to work in what the late anthropologist David Graeber eloquently called \u201c bullshit jobs , \u201d the WEF \u2019 s academics and researchers understand that they could lose their grip on power .\nGlobal financial inequalities are widening as anti-democratic sentiments grow within \u201c democratic \u201d societies , whose populations realise that they have no control over their lives .\nRather than risk revolutions in numerous countries from strikers \u2013 now called The Great Resignation \u2013 the WEF seeks to ideologically capture potential revolutionary leaders and re-programme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g.\n, Greta Thunberg \u2019 s platform at the annual conference ) .\nThe businesses that fund and join WEF \u2019 s Davos meetings recognise that real estate remains the physical basis on which profitable assets are constructed .\nUnder slogans like the Great Reset , the Fourth Industrial Revolution , and Build Back Better , WEF elites want to cement their new world order .\nBut what will that new order look like for non-elites ?\nUnlike the present global malaise , the \u201c new normal \u201d \u2013 or \u201c next normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 aims to use hi-technology and data collection to tailor environments to the needs and wishes of the public who will be expected to participate in \u201c sustainable \u201d infrastructure and be data points for constant public health monitoring .\nLike the hapless victims of Huxley \u2019 s dystopia , tomorrow \u2019 s society will be happily enslaved , at least in the minds of WEF planners .\nWorkspaces will blur the lines between personalisation and professionalism , feelings of being cheated by the system will be reconceived as consuming less to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality will be soothed with immersion into joyous , incessant virtual reality like Facebook \u2019 s new Meta concepts .\nMega-wealth in the global economy is a house of cards : it consists of digits on bank account computer screens that increase when the rich buy and sell repackaged debts to each other .\nWhen the gravy train derails every decade or so , the public bails out the perpetrators .\nYet , the three main bases on which the intangible economy is constructed are tangible : precious metals , hydrocarbons , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world are the asset managers who hold the stocks , shares , bonds , and portfolios of the banks , hedge funds , insurers , pension companies , and real estate holdings .\nThey include BlackRock , State Street , UBS , and Vanguard .\nTheir fake wealth would not exist without the physical ownership of land .\nReal estate is the skin of the balloon in which they blow the hot air of money markets .\nThe WEF corporations understand the importance of real estate in relation to wealth inequality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger generations are getting more and more desperate .\nIn terms of size , housing quality is leading to mental health issues as younger people live and work in increasingly crowded and expensive cities .\nNot only is property ownership a dream for the majority of young westerners , renting is becoming harder as owners are reluctant to let their property to people in the insecure work of the expanding gig economy .\nWEF corporations fear a brain and labour drain from cities as work-from-home youngsters flee to the countryside where dwellings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cities generate 80 per cent of global GDP , yet their revenues ( e.g.\n, from local taxes and property sales ) are expected to fall as fewer people use public transport and reduced council budgets lead to disinvestment from public services .\nAsset companies want to keep workers locked into cities and are looking to redesign urban hellholes to make them more appealing : eco-friendly , health conscious , and tailored to the psychology of the individual.1 WEF authors say that the new agenda will take place via \u201c an increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxpayer foots the bill , as usual .\nNew urban slums will be greenwashed and prettied via the harnessing of personalised big tech data collection for \u201c customisation.\n\u201d While the rich continue to plunder , the working classes will have to get used to \u201c adaptive reuse \u201d ; an eco-friendly normalisation of second-hand products ; or \u201c pre-loved \u201d as they now call them .\nThe WEF says that , \u201c The private sector can also play an instrumental role in helping the public sector craft legislation that is viable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nWEF emphasises that a whole tenth of global GDP is concentrated in a single sector : real estate .\nCommenting on the above , Christian Ulbrich , Global Chief Executive Officer and President of the real estate services company JLL , confirms : \u201c The world will look different in the coming years ; our cities and urban centres especially so.\n\u201d 2 On greenwashing in response to public pressure , Ahmed Galal Ismail , Chief Executive Officer of the holding company Majid Al Futtaim Properties , says \u201c global investors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their investee companies incorporate , track and report ESG [ environmental , social and governance ] performance into the risk-adjusted returns that they deliver.\n\u201d 3 As we shall examine in more detail , artificial intelligence and the instantaneous advertising and automated services markets are exploding .\nIn so-called smart homes , the wishes and intentions of the occupant will be sales opportunities for programmed machines , from fridges to heating systems , as the very biology of the tenant is tracked and analysed under the PR-friendly cover of public health monitoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in smart homes might also be tailored to provide commercial services .\nAI could , for instance , offer to adjust the solar-controlled room temperature if in-home cameras sense that the occupant might be too hot or cold .\n\u201c Autonomous buildings autotune , adapting to dynamic indoor and outdoor conditions , create optimal working conditions.\n\u201d Through bastardised communitarianism designed by WEF to prevent the poor from ever attaining wealth under the slogan of \u201c equity , \u201d the buildings will be designed with \u201c cost-sharing mechanisms.\n\u201d Existing examples , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include the hub at Causeway , Boston , Massachusetts : a mixed-use revitalisation project that includes heat-regulating glass , airflow-supported balconies , and local food production .\nAnother is Hong Kong \u2019 s Taikoo Place : an interconnected business hub .\nCiting patents per head of population , the WEF notes that increased population density \u2013 i.e.\n, big cities \u2013 is linked to increased creativity and productivity .\nBut the people who do the hard work don \u2019 t share in the patent wealth .\nTaxpayers , for instance , funded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big pharma reaps the rewards .\nIn other words , they want people crammed into cities to boost innovation , but they also want to polish the turd of urbanisation by making dystopian dives look like efficient , modern pockets of eco-friendly mingling .\nFor instance , knowing that most people prefer the more relaxed atmosphere of villages to crowded and impersonal cities , the government of Victoria , Australia supports the 20 Minute City concept in which the village \u2013 grocer , butcher , baker , pharmacy , health clinic , bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Sustainable McDonald \u2019 s \u201d is an oxymoron , yet Australia once again serves as a testbed for the Fourth Industrial Revolution ( 4IR ) with \u201c sustainable \u201d fast-food outlets that allegedly cut CO emissions by a third .\nThe solar-powered \u201c smartly \u201d ventilated takeaway/restaurant in Melton South is a prototype for other sites .\nThrough Podium , Australia is also pioneering the end-to-end digitisation of real estate : from design , purchase , lease , and construction , to repurchase , letting , contract , and the new age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new blockchain for real estate markets .\nIn this part of the new world order , constant labour is normalised .\n\u201c From focus zones to work cafes , the space integrates \u2018 external \u2019 elements such as coworking and the home office.\n\u201d Happy slaves must also be healthy slaves .\nDesign concepts include an \u201c ergonomically supportive home office with limited distractions.\n\u201d There will be a \u201c blend of social spaces with productivity enablers , \u201d such as colleagues who give unconscious prompts to others to work harder .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the building itself .\nFor instance , computers on which people work might be strategically placed near the coffee machine so that the idler sees their colleagues labouring and is prompted to return to work .\nExercise machines might be placed near the snack bar so that workers tempted by candy are also guilted into doing a few minutes \u2019 exercise before returning to their toil .\nCovid has given WEF corporations the chance to integrate public health concepts via constant social biosurveillance in their existing 4IR agenda .\nOver the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal \u201d became normal as politicians , intellectuals , and the media sought to brainwash us into believing that terrorism would make total surveillance and travel restrictions a new normal , as would limitations on freedom and growth caused by anthropogenic climate change .\nSince Covid , the WEF asks : \u201c What will the \u2018 next normal \u2019 look like ?\n\u201d ( Emphasis added ) .\nWEF \u2019 s message is confused .\nOn the one hand , its authors lessen mental health concerns by promoting community , but on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the socioeconomic order will increase isolation .\nFacebook is notorious for keeping people isolated in echo chambers , but the new Meta rebranding , as we shall see , will blend isolation and community in augmented , virtual reality ( VR ) settings .\nThe happy slave will be alone in their tiny , greenwashed hovel but feel emotionally connected with friends in a VR universe .\nWhen it comes to online shopping , there will be less \u201c face-to-face interaction.\n\u201d The last-minute deliveries spurred by Covid \u201c will persist beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the kinds of people whom the WEF envisages occupying the above properties .\nJab mandates for working people are part of the \u201c next normal , \u201d and patents on the vaccines are of primary interest to the mega-rich .\nBut the WEF is less interested in ensuring the safety and efficacy of Covid vaccines and more concerned with bolstering \u201c vaccine confidence.\n\u201d Even though the jab appears to be effective only in reducing hospitalisations , the WEF was quick to ask how its thought leaders could work to promote \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed products.6 It is important to distinguish between words and actions .\nSometimes , WEF founder and chairman Klaus Schwab speaks truth and horrifies those familiar with his words .\nExamples include references to microchipping the population and replacing humans with robots.7 At other times , Schwab seems to say the opposite , acknowledging that what is erroneously called \u201c capitalism \u201d \u2013 which actually means state-backed monopoly corporatism \u2013 has damaged the younger generations , stagnated the middle classes , and fuelled the climate crisis .\nIn order to look good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as some kind of progressive or \u201c woke \u201d ( as the right-wing say ) face of \u201c capitalism , \u201d Schwab points out that which is wrong with the \u201c capitalist \u201d order .\nThe reality is that pretty words and agreement with those injured by profit-driven corporatism is a cover .\nIt is as if an abuser consoles their victim while continuing to abuse them .\nIn his introduction to the WEF \u2019 s report on youth , Schwab plays this game , writing things many of us would agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-term profit and that intergenerational parity is better than growing inequality.8 As part of its pyramid structure , the WEF claims that its global reach on this issue was over two million people , the vast majority of whom were journalists , intellectuals , businesspeople , and community leaders ; in other words , rungs on the ladder of hierarchy , not ordinary people .\nThese so-called cultural leaders will shape the doctrines for those below them through entertainment , education , media , and the workplace .\nThe report pays lip service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuels and working with Generation Z \u2019 s thought leaders to create a new agenda for sustainability .\nIn reality , it is the same old monopoly corporatism in which ordinary people are the flotsam and jetsam in the plans of those higher than them in the social order .\nFor example , one Lab held in Luxembourg concluded that the WEF should decide what is or is not ethical consumption : \u201c It would be unfair and na\u00efve to put all the burden on consumers having to educate themselves in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , someone decides not to buy the latest Apple gadget because \u2018 child mining \u2019 in Congo extracted the device \u2019 s coltan , \u2018 forced labour \u2019 in China created the product , \u2018 air miles \u2019 brought the item to the West , and \u2018 tax avoidance \u2019 enables the company to be a monopoly , a WEF messaging campaign might greenwash and claim that the gadget \u2019 s production was ethical and its carbon footprint neutral .\nAnother event in Australia concluded that the WEF should harness the wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agenda so that people resonate with ancient ways of living whilst continuing to work for corporate overlords .\nThis is a form of mind control in which the labouring masses have internal freedom and believe they participate in a spiritual society , when in fact the limits of their reality are set by superiors who pretend to consult with and gain the approval of those they are controlling .\nThe Davos Lab \u2019 s Millennium Manifesto is jam-packed with empty verbiage such as , \u201c We will ask big questions to advance bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WEF agenda is what Schwab calls the Great Reset : a professed plan to promote economic and social equity while cementing the structures that guarantee worsening inequality .\nIn addition to trapping working people in properties designed to enhance their productivity and monetise their idiosyncrasies ( like the AI temperature control example above ) , the revolutionary potential of the exploited classes as well as their dissatisfaction will , if the WEF planners get their way , be quelled by the promotion of transhumanism and virtual reality , in which humanity is \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and digital enhancements .\nOne of the methods of control is trapping people in social media bubbles .\nAfter US President Donald Trump came to power ( 2017\u201321 ) and threatened the neoliberal agenda , ideological managers such as mainstream media , think tanks , and political unions , took action against what they call \u201c fake news.\n\u201d Fact-check organisations have morphed into the guardians of neoliberal elites .\nOften \u201c populists \u201d like Trump and his supporters lie , misreport , and publish fake news .\nFact-checkers expose those lies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In most cases , so-called fact-checkers simply argue over interpretations of truth , which the fact-checkers then use to delegitimise real populism .\nThe ideological basis from which they operate promotes the agenda of the World Economic Forum and others .\nBut who fact checks the fact-checkers ?\nResearchers have uncovered their connections to the political , corporate , and media establishment .\nIn this revolving door system , former mainstream corporate media editors and journalists take up new roles as self-professed fact-checkers whose targets are those opposed to the neoliberal order .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years , been on a deplatforming crusade as part of \u201c woke washing \u201d ( while keeping oppressive and prejudicial structures in place ) and under the influence of the intelligence services .\nIn their evidence to US Congress after the 6 January Capitol insurrection , both Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey confirmed that because of \u201c security \u201d concerns , domestic US intelligence agencies advised ( i.e.\n, leaned on ) them to deplatform accounts , including the President \u2019 s .\nAll of the above serves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users to the boundaries of what is acceptable within neoliberal culture .\nAnything too progressive ( e.g.\n, the World Socialist Web Site ) or regressive ( e.g.\n, Breitbart News ) is censored , pushing the entire user base of hundreds of millions of people into a giant corporate-approved echo chamber ( e.g.\n, CNN , New York Times ) .\nThis process is called \u201c digital literacy \u201d by the WEF and others .\nWithout \u201c digital literacy , \u201d people might fall for dangerous \u201c fake news \u201d ( i.e.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nBut people might also create and share real news and real information that does not fall within the bounds of accepted neoliberal ideology , such as questioning the efficacy of big pharma-produced vaccines or pointing out the serious problems with the corporate-political elite .\nIn making the world \u201c digitally literate , \u201d the WEF employs doublethink : \u201c Steps must be taken to prevent abuse and harm while maintaining the freedom to openly exchange ideas.\n\u201d 11 Slaving for the ultra-rich in personally-tailored smart cities , the younger generations censored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media will , according to the WEF model , augment their capacities with technology .\nThe transhumanist agenda is specifically harnessed for the older , infirm generations who have gone from being useless eaters \u2013 from the WEF perspective \u2013 to potential data points for augmentative technologies .\nAs part of the WEF propaganda campaign , the organisation is preparing to \u201c Articulate the potential benefits of artificial intelligence , \u201d particularly for the older generations.12 For \u201c older \u201d people , which we assume means the over-60s , WEF suggests placing representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being that over-60s tend to have different aesthetic tastes , practical preferences , and physical and cognitive requirements to young people .\nThe young are born into the new technological changes , and those changes become part of their environment .\nIn contrast , the over-60s must adapt .\nPursuing profit , companies are using the WEF as a vehicle to help turn the over-60s into transhumanist augmentation technology consumers : home-help robots , implants for better eyesight , time-released painkillers , etc .\nThe WEF does not seek solutions for ending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather for more transparency .\nThis way companies can cheat consumers whilst being honest that they are cheating them .\nThe aim is to make consumers feel less angry because they appreciate the honesty .\nWEF suggests that companies \u201c Disclose the data being collected.\n\u201d They hope that older people will thus be more willing to have their information sold .\nThe WEF also wants to \u201c Obtain meaningful consent.\n\u201d The clue is in the word \u201c meaningful , \u201d suggesting that up until now , consent has not been meaningful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to \u201c Design for appropriate trust.\n\u201d Just as they seek to make the younger generations \u201c digitally literate , \u201d i.e.\n, keep them in a mental prison , WEF corporations aim to protect the elderly from \u201c deception , \u201d 13 but not the deceptions on which their system is built .\nThe WEF is aware that the general public might , if left on their own , form groups , communities , parties , and movements that spread an anti- \u201c capitalist \u201d message and develop new social models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded , it would not only hurt the profits of the owner-classes but threaten the system they spent so long developing .\nRepackaging profit-driven agendas as some form of third position between capitalism and socialism is achieved , in part , by rhetorically emphasising \u201c corporate responsibility.\n\u201d 14 The WEF also seeks to capture potential revolutionaries by appealing to \u201c social justice.\n\u201d The WEF intellectuals are aware that young people tend to be driven more than old people by outrage .\nThe right-wing dismisses these young , conscious activists as \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to change the system in their own image , WEF intellectuals want to make people feel like they have \u2013 without actually having \u2013 input into their conditions .\n\u201c [ R ] ecognising , co-designing , partnering and learning with impacted stakeholders\u2026 must be at the centre of any corporate action on equity and social justice in our unequal world.\n\u201d 15 Another factor profitable to the corporate class is social impact bonds .\nHistorically , the underclasses \u2013 those below the working classes \u2013 were a financial negative .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public housing , etc .\nThe working classes laboured , the middle classes paid the most relative taxes , and the rich lived off the labour of the poor , profits generated by the consuming middle classes , and hording through tax avoidance .\nBut over the last decades , banks figured out ways of profiting from the underclasses : social impact bonds .\nUnder such systems , government cuts back on social welfare and relies instead on charities to keep offenders out of prison and reach homelessness reduction targets , etc .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ then reimbursed by government , and the loans of the banks are serviced by taxpayers .\nThis social impact bond system creates an incentive to have a permanent underclass and champion the alleged virtues of \u201c charity \u201d instead of systemic change that brings genuine inclusivity and democratic empowerment.16 Gerbrand Haverkamp , Executive Director of the World Benchmarking Alliance , is quoted as saying : \u201c [ W ] e need businesses that can profitably solve societal problems , without profiting from societal harms.\n\u201d 17 This model incentivises the creation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , occultic element to the WEF \u2019 s agenda .\nCertain members who currently practice what they believe to be online \u201c meme magic ( k ) \u201d are also involved in the development of Facebook \u2019 s VR world : the Metaverse .\nA near-billionaire developer and Trump supporter , Palmer Luckey , used social media to boost Trump \u2019 s profile and deflate his rival Hillary Clinton in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential election .\nLuckey made his fortune selling the Oculus VR headset to Zuckerberg .\nLuckey \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , believed that \u201c meme magic is real.\n\u201d The Millennial generation started to use images with text circulated online to boost their agendas and attack their enemies ( memes ) .\nOne famous meme was Pepe the Frog , an innocent cartoon hijacked by racists and right-wingers ( usually both ) to signal their political allegiances .\nThe cultists behind the spread of such memes believed that they could invoke spiritual power ( \u201c meme magic ( k ) \u201d to vanquish enemies .\nPepe , to give one of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both eyes in the shape of a Freemasonic dot-triangle .\nRegardless of his involvement or lack of involvement in such practices , the executive director of Oculus , Jason Rubin , sent his 50-page report on the Metaverse to Zuckerberg .\nJust as US military planners devised a \u201c shock and awe \u201d terror campaign to inflict on the Iraqi people in 2003 , Rubin said that \u201c shock and awe \u201d tactics would condition the user to accept their new digital life in the Metaverse .\nCNBC has seen leaked policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a digital universe of virtual ads , filled with virtual goods that people buy.\n\u201d 18 Chillingly ( no pun intended ) , FB Oculus \u2019 s Michael Abrash says : \u201c It all started with Snow Crash , \u201d the futuristic \u2018 90s novel written by Neal Stephenson .\nThe Guardian , which picked up the Abrash quote , conveniently omits a crucial detail about the novel : that the fictional online world on which the new scheme is based contains a mind virus that can infect users as they merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Snow Crash , though providing no evidence , certain individuals claim that the Pepe meme that evolved into something else has , for many years , contained a hidden mind virus .\nWhether the mind virus is real or not is beside the point .\nCertain online occultists , including Luckey , are using the fear of mind control , coupled with what Rubin calls \u201c shock and awe , \u201d to get users to submit to the dialectic : a \u201c progressive \u201d Zuckerberg world order of Joe \u201c Build Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a more overtly fascistic world order of \u201c meme magic ( k ) \u201d and mind warfare using Trump as a frontman .\nPart of the Trump meme war and the fake news hysteria surrounding the President had the effect of making \u2018 truth \u2019 a vague and flexible concept .\nAs the concept of truth becomes fuzzy , that which is real is set to become fuzzier .\nWEF says of Meta : \u201c This could manifest itself in several ways , but many experts believe that \u2018 extended reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of augmented , virtual and mixed reality \u2013 will play an important role.\n\u201d 19 The WEF hopes that once we have been bombarded into the new system , we will all be Huxleyan happy slaves in their Brave New World , playing with intangible VR toys and mingling with avatars of our loved ones .\n5 .\nWEF and McKinsey , \u201c Pandemic , Parcels and Public Vaccination

hinges on eight core virtues : courage , curiosity , temperance , humility , liberty , honor , wisdom , and humor .\nThese virtues are vital rungs on the ladder toward achieving wholeness in character .\nCourage frees character , curiosity grows character , temperance balances character , humility grounds character , liberty stabilizes character , honor unifies character , wisdom guides character , and humor overcomes character .\nLet \u2019 s break it down .\nCourage is the bedrock of human excellence .\nBefore any other virtue can be realized , courage must be self-actualized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deviation or there is no \u201c first.\n\u201d Period .\nTherefore , it is of the utmost importance that you live a courage-based lifestyle over a comfort-based lifestyle .\nWithout the initial leap of courage there is no freedom , no excellence .\nWithout courage , one is merely restricted to the conventional , inhibited by the whims of others , imprisoned inside the box of the status quo , and hampered by outdated reasoning .\nWithout courage , the third eye remains calcified , rigid , blind .\nWith the leap of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe world unlocks .\nThe mind unbolts .\nThe soul unfastens .\nInhibitions dissolve , and serendipity , adaptability , and improvisation manifest .\nBoundaries transform into horizons .\nComfort zones stretch into adventure .\nYou split the smoke .\nYou shatter the mirrors .\nAnd the glory of the path is revealed .\nCuriosity is essential .\nIt is the fuel that launches us beyond faith .\nIt is the cure for the disease of certainty .\nTrue curiosity is deep , primal , absorbing , imaginative and ravenous for updated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdated knowledge to rest .\nCuriosity is the ultimate existential leveling mechanism .\nIt forces our thoughts outside the box , stretches our comfort zone , shatters entrenched mental paradigms , keeps us ahead of the curve , and pushes the envelope of all the things we \u2019 ve taken for granted .\nCuriosity is on the edge of tomorrow , laughing into the abyss , shirking the tiny-minded perspective of our parochial past , and gaping in astonishment and wild wonder into the mysterium tremendum et fascinans of the Great Mystery .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperance .\nIt \u2019 s the core of universal law .\nUnluckily , this benchmark is hidden in a \u2018 language older than words , \u2019 which can sometimes seem impossible to decode .\nModeration is Health \u2019 s secret decoder ring .\nAlthough some things must be moderated more than others , extremism in anything is the bane of health .\nWe can breathe too much oxygen .\nWe can drink too much water .\nWe can even live too much in the moment .\nThrough moderation we discover health .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperance .\nWe maintain our personal health through moderation so that health in general can manifest .\nAs Gandhi wisely suggested , \u201c Live simply so that others may simply live.\n\u201d A good rule of thumb , then , is this : moderation in all things , to include moderation .\nThis way we are proactively injecting balance into the cosmos , while at the same time enjoying life .\nThe key is to accept responsibility for the consequences of both our moderate and immoderate choices .\nTricky , but that \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research suggests that a healthy dose of humility helps protect against extremism , polarization , and bias .\nWhen we are humble , we can admit that we are fallible , imperfect , and uncertain .\nIt gives us the courage to admit when we are wrong .\nWithout humility we are more likely to fall victim to cognitive dissonance .\nWithout humility we are blinded by faith and stuck in hand-me-down ideologies and outdated traditions .\nWithout humility we are more likely to be

Our Inner Drive & Intentionality", "content": "The Will to Purpose \u2013 Activating Our Inner Drive & Intentionality We are familiar with the concept that a person has no real choice , and we generally regard this in relation to our commercial choices .\nThat is , what we choose to buy is generally a decision based on a selection of limited choice .\nThis has also been referred to as \u2018 curated needs.\n\u2019 What we think or believe we want , or need , is conditioned into us \u2013 or \u2018 curated \u2019 \u2013 so that we are merely responding to managed external stimuli to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valid , and is indeed an operative modality , it remains within the material realm .\nIn the opening citation , the thinker and author J.G .\nBennett was referring to a form of choice beyond that of a material one .\nHe was relating to the lack of choice within the inner world of the human being \u2013 that is , the presence of human will .\nBennett was speaking and writing from the 1940s to the 1970s , yet what he said then is as relevant for today as he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to historical time or place but to an almost timeless situation \u2013 the human condition .\nThe lack of genuine inner will of the human being has been made starker in modern times due to the lens of psychology and similar sciences .\nProfessor Mattias Desmet has recently popularised the concept of mass formation and false solidarity , which refer to how crowd psychology is established and sustained .\n[ i ] In his recent book ( The Psychology of Totalitarianism ) , Desmet points out that what we call totalitarianism has only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , since the beginning of the twentieth century .\nTwo previous examples that he gives are the Stalinist regime that came to power on the back of the Russian Revolution , and the National Socialist ( Nazi ) regime in Germany .\nMost recently , he says , the world is experiencing the rise of a global form of totalitarianism under the guise , or ideology , of technocracy .\nThe one thing that totalitarianism has in common is that it is based on ideology rather than brute power .\nFurther , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programmed ) into obeyance through propaganda and social-cultural conditioning , rather than forced through fear ( as is the case with dictatorships ) .\nThe mass formation of willing obedience is a symbol for our times .\nWith the availability of global communications , a largely digitally \u2018 plugged-in \u2019 world population , the widespread influence of controlled media , and the pervasive presence of mind-influencing technologies , the human species has never been in a more pressing moment in its collective history .\nModern day humanity may not only be suffering from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importantly , it may be experiencing the dilemma of a lack of connection with internal will power .\nIt is this dominant state of the human psyche \u2013 we may even go so far as to call it a widespread psychosis \u2013 that lies at the root of much of our present ills with its sense of apathy and pessimism .\nSome readers will be familiar with German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche \u2019 s concept of the will to power ; lesser known is the English philosopher Colin Wilson and his notion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of freedom and choice is not a social problem \u2013 it is an internal one for it requires an \u2018 intensity of will.\n\u2019 [ ii ] In other words , it is a personal struggle to achieve a form of self-awakening , or triggering , to arouse oneself from the torpidity and apathy of life .\nThe issue is that for most people they don \u2019 t consider the fragility of life \u2019 s situation .\nThe general masses , at least in the western world , consider themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the belief structure that they are protected and looked after by their governments and social institutions and that , give or take a few things , they have most essential needs provided for .\nSuch people , I would posit , live on the outside of themselves \u2013 they are skin-dwellers .\nThey live through their personalities and are most likely to adhere to mass consensus narratives .\nThey are to be swayed by the rollercoaster ride of external events and react as anticipated by the governing elites who manipulate finances , food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis mass of people will only recognize the loss of freedom when it is threatened in relation to external events .\nIt is a manufactured sense of freedom for once the threat has vanished \u2013 or seemingly made to vanish \u2013 then the meaning of freedom dissipates for the danger is no longer perceived .\nThat is , it is an exterior crisis or danger that triggers people into action and as the perceived threat fades , they slip back once again into apathy and mass obedience .\nThere is a lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human will requires that a person has the will to acquire insight .\nThis they must choose for themselves , for no other agency shall give it to them .\nOn the contrary , many social systems are designed to deteriorate a person \u2019 s will by compelling them to give away their dependency and authority onto external systems .\nConsistency , commitment , and the intention to will , are human aspects severely undermined by the deliberate constraint of material structures and social systems .\nSuch critical observations and the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the rise of what I would call \u2018 lazy spirituality.\n\u2019 This is the type of Instagram positive thinking or commercial well-beingness that online \u2018 spiritual celebrities \u2019 are all too eager to promote ( and sell ) .\nBehind such on-demand spiritual well-being-positive-thinking packages is a passivity or laziness to critically engage in inner work and to gain perceptive cognition to recognize the fallacy inherent within the material domain .\nIt is one thing to be positively-orientated and having \u2018 oneness \u2019 for all creation ; it is another matter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are forces in play in the world that are active in nullifying metaphysical values and realities in order to replace them with an ever-deepening materialism .\nIt would seem that there is an increasing form of cultural laziness and indecision , especially in this current time when people chiefly wish for things to be made easy for them .\nInstead of a person having faith and hope that they can change by making real effort , they are usually entertained with illusions that then take away from them the impulse to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today \u2019 s world , a person who seeks to develop inner awareness and to raise their perceptive capacity often find themselves at odds with their cultural milieu .\nThose with \u2018 spiritual seriousness , \u2019 so to say , are what Colin Wilson referred to as the Outsider .\n[ iii ] Such individuals have an intangible need to be more than just a \u2018 happy , well-fed animal.\n\u2019 Again , Wilson referred to this state as being that of the robot ; he said that we all have a robot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and take over all our daily duties for us .\nThe Greek-Armenian mystic G.I .\nGurdjieff called this the state of the \u2018 man machine.\n\u2019 I have referred to this as the robosapien .\n[ iv ] Within such automated states the individual experiences the world through a narrowed lens of awareness .\nWilson , for example , recognized that such limited awareness almost lulled a person into a \u2018 state of permanent drowsiness , like being half-anesthetized \u2019 so that a broader vision of life is restricted .\nAnd this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyday life affects us .\nWhether it be through external impacts , stimulants , distractions , information , technological entanglement , energetic haze , and more , the environment of everyday life pacifies us by closing down our perceptual horizons .\nIn response to this , Colin Wilson noted that \u2018 it is as impossible to exercise freedom in an unreal world as it is to jump while you are falling.\n\u2019 [ v ] Freedom is not only related to physical mobility and access to human rights ; it is also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind \u2019 that can pull a person out of the collective of mass formation ( as Desmet would call it ) .\nThe modern life can be regarded as a cause of spiritual decay because it seeks to demolish any recognition of a metaphysical reality .\nAnd through this , many people are unknowingly suffering a form of \u2018 reality deficiency.\n\u2019 There have been people who , over the years , have strived to point this out to us , from wisdom teachers , mystics , and philosophers ( like Colin Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving inner nourishment ; over time , this acts to deprive human cognition by literally starving it of nutrients ( perception ) .\nWe are in a time right now of great \u2018 reality deficiency \u2019 as the dominant consensus narratives peddle their lies , manipulations , and programming .\nEach age has its own form of reality and/or metaphysical suppression , from the physically overt ( Spanish Inquisition ) to the covert ( technocracy ) .\nWithin each specific era , there are calculated forces that act to impinge upon the individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-attainment but , more importantly , a connection with a transcendental impulse ( what some may call as Source ) .\nThe historian Arnold Toynbee believed that civilizations ( and its individuals ) progress by overcoming struggles ; by moving through \u2018 challenge points , \u2019 so to speak .\nIf the crisis is too great , the civilization succumbs and collapses .\nIf the challenge is not great enough , the civilization overcomes and becomes complacent , slides into greater decadence and eventually collapses .\nThe challenge must be just right \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gary Lachman calls it .\nChallenges bring out the best in individuals too , yet they must be able to grow and develop through the crisis \u2013 and this is often down to an inner will or drive .\nToynbee believed that a civilization needs to produce a \u2018 creative minority \u2019 to meet such a challenge of its time .\nIt would seem that we are amidst such a \u2018 challenge point \u2019 right now ; and it is not only a physical crisis but also an existential one .\nI would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not survive indefinitely without some inborn sense of a transcendental purpose \u2013 otherwise it is like a hollow shell that becomes increasingly brittle over time .\nBritish philosopher and historian Nicholas Hagger , whose monumental work The Fire and the Stones examines the sacred impulse ( the \u2018 Fire/Light \u2019 ) within twenty-five civilizations , likewise has shown how civilizations are inspired by the transcendental impulse and decay when such an impulse is forgotten or dismissed .\n[ vi ] What is required is for us , our communities and cultures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reality .\nFurther , that what we take to be reality is a merger between the physical and the metaphysical .\nAs such , humanity is a being \u2018 of spirit \u2019 that is manifesting through the intermediary of a physical body .\nTo take this even further , we need to come to recognize that all existence is consciousness primarily , and that physical phenomena is an energetic state that manifests from a source of consciousness .\nWhat is required of humanity to survive beyond this existential crisis and challenge point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this possible ?\nColin Wilson was not so sure .\nWilson believed , and stated as such , that the majority of people can not accept the burden of becoming more conscious .\nHe felt that the \u2018 masses \u2019 were both consciously and subconsciously choosing the more comfortable \u2018 mediocracy of life.\n\u2019 I would even question what this term means any more \u2013 what is the \u2018 mediocracy of life \u2019 when we can no longer be sure what reality is ?\nAbstractions have now replaced realities to create an enveloping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the absurd.\n\u2019 As I talked about in my book Bardo Times , [ vii ] life has become a simulation \u2013 a simulacra as the French theorist Jean Baudrillard would say \u2013 and the notion of what is \u2018 real \u2019 appears to have dissolved into what is the latest consensus narrative .\nWhat is important to acknowledge in these challenging times is that as the chaos whirls around us , humanity stands on the threshold of a higher form of life .\nThis is the other point that perceptive individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ( not least of them has been the Indian sage Sri Aurobindo ) .\nAnd this threshold becomes more apparent and urgent whenever a civilization begins either its decline or its necessary transition to a different epoch and modality .\nThis is the challenge that civilization must face \u2013 either to raise/adjust its level of consciousness and perceptive capacity or stagnate and then collapse .\nHuman civilization necessarily reflects the state of perception of its inhabitants .\nAs that indwelling perception expands , so too does the physical environment develop in alignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even being deliberately reduced , as is the case right now , then entropic or atrophying forces begin to dominate .\nThis is why we must resist , at great effort , to submit to a programming of conformity and perceptive limitation that is likely to come about through increased technocratic forms of social management and control .\nThis is where Colin Wilson \u2019 s notion of the will to perceive comes in .\nDue to the external environment , human consciousness is generally conditioned into a dulled state so that higher insights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get through .\nWe need to seek to \u2018 widen \u2019 ( expand ) our consciousness beyond such limiting influences so that greater perceptive insights can be achieved .\nMost people , however , are reflections of their surroundings and , as such , require external inputs to motivate or trigger them into action .\nChaos and crises can function as such triggering impacts .\nThe \u2018 will to perceive \u2019 also activates a will to purpose .\nBehind the human developmental impulse there is a push , I would say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 will to purpose \u2019 there is a lack of conscious participation .\nIt is the will to purpose that distinguishes the human being from the machine \u2013 the \u2018 robosapien.\n\u2019 Modern life , with its technocratic pull , is encouraging people not to think but to allow automation to take over duties and responsibilities .\nOn the contrary , we need to be \u2018 pulling ourselves up by the bootstraps \u2019 and intentionally driving ourselves across the threshold .\nWhat could this threshold be ?\nHumanity is moving towards a stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognizant of its role as a fusion ( a bridge or merger ) between spirit/consciousness and physicality/matter .\nWe are , in these times , the forward ground crew sent ahead to prepare the groundwork .\nSometime in the future \u2013 it could be ten , twenty , thirty years or more \u2013 human understanding and the sciences will come to recognize the primary role of consciousness behind all existence .\nAnd when this occurs , human life will alter drastically .\nWe shall understand that human existence is a merging of non-physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion of life and reality will be greatly expanded beyond current conceptions .\nWe shall be propelled beyond the confines of the physical robot \u2013 the robosapien \u2013 and shall utilize presently unknown organs of perception .\nBut we are not at that threshold yet .\nAnd this is partly why we are seeing a contestation of forces in play .\nThere are forces that do not wish for humanity to reach , and pass , this threshold for we shall then no longer be their passive robots to manage and control .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd there is a small contingency that wish to cut humanity off from this transcendental impulse , to isolate us from receiving such developmental forces , and to push us back into our perceptual prisons of the \u2018 everyday mundane.\n\u2019 Such forces aim to increase the programming and technologies of cognitive influence to hypnotize the mass of humanity into accepting an \u2018 upside-down \u2019 reality that the robosapien seems the most suited to .\nOur will to purpose now is about having the inner drive and intentionality to move us beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alienation , and forward into a state of heightened cognition and expanded perceptual awareness .\nIt is my view that the \u2018 teething pains \u2019 that we are presently experiencing represent the birthing , or arrival , of a new form of consciousness coming to manifestation through the human species .\nThat is , a mergence with an expanded field of consciousness .\nAnd for this to emerge , the individual is called upon to \u2018 meet it \u2019 halfway , so to speak .\nSocial forces will attempt to continue to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and physical/biological interventions .\nAnd yet , against these artificial constrictions , I am confident that if enough of us ( we don \u2019 t need to be a majority ) can strive for cognitive freedom , perceptive clarity , and inner awareness , we can become the early wave \u2013 the evolutionary outsider \u2013 to make the initial steps across the threshold .\nJust enough of us need to act as the \u2018 antennae of the race \u2019 [ viii ] to pass the baton onto our descendants .\nAnd that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough reason to activate our will to purpose .\nKingsley L.

\u2019 s Note : Jonathon is the author of Rainforest Medicine ~ Preserving Indigenous Science and Biological Diversity in the Upper Amazon ( www.rainforestmedicine.net ) While Western audiences expound on the virtues of ayahuasca , little is spoken of its precarious nature .\nPotential for ayahuasca ceremonies going haywire is growing exponentially as grandmother medicine travels far and wide without the fundamental education that guides its traditional use .\nCultures that have worked with ayahuasca for generations know all too well that adhering to traditional guidelines is a prerequisite .\nTo guarantee that the auspicious nature of ayahuasca wins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be understood .\nHere I share two golden time-tested realities related to entheogenic plant usage : 1 ) the map of the energy realms and the reality of the divine immortals as the unfailing guides , and 2 ) the energy clock and how this relates to which spirits one may be relating to .\n3 ) Some cultural and traditional considerations .\nGiven the extensive nature of this discussion , here in this short article , I have decided to stay mainly on the topic of providing basic insights into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct the usage of entheogenic plant medicines towards an auspicious and felicitous denouement .\nAll across the South American continent Indigenous peoples , communities and various religious groups use the vine banisteriopsis caapi and its admixture plants as a sacrament .\nThe traditions that govern its usage and related vocabulary are as broad as the region where it has been historically used , yet the foundational pillars remain constant .\nThis being for communion with divine beings and for essentially evolving heaven on earth .\nThese entheogenic plants are considered as \u201c gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indigenous peoples and human communities in many of life \u2019 s countenances .\nIn particular , I want to highlight the ability of plant spirit medicine , across traditional cultures , to grant clarity on how to remain aligned with the currents of a heavenly way of life .\nBeing a co-contributor of evolving heaven on earth , this is not a philosophical idea , but rather a highly practical school of life .\nA spiritual and practical science of integrity , spiritual development and energy cultivation : sacred plant medicine traditions offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adhere to a certain life disposition that permits them to open energy blockages and live with happiness and a greater sense of ease .\nFor it is not just today that life has been fraught with challenges and complexities .\nIf we adhere to the wisdom of traditional torchbearers , divine immortal beings compassionately gifted sacred plant medicines to the first peoples so that they could recuperate and maintain humanity \u2019 s original unspoiled nature .\nDespite this , the precarious nature of ayahuasca has not just appeared among westerners in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago in its ancestral setting , in the Amazon , the use of sacred pant medicines has not all been kind , and any elder of the tradition will share too many accounts of ayahuasca being used to manipulate , enact mind control , force upon people demented realities , bring about trauma , damage others , and it has even been used for murder .\nI expound upon this extensively in chapter two of my book Rainforest Medicine , Degradation of the Spiritual Science : Sorcery and Superstition .\nWestern audiences are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working with ayahuasca , and there are countless accounts of ceremonies gone haywire ; participants leaving splintered , worse than when they entered .\nIn general terms , in order to guide its auspicious use , the fundamentals remain constant throughout all the cultures that traditionally use it .\nAllow me here to elucidate some of the lesser understood characteristics of Indigenous Science .\nI will also draw from millenary Taoist traditions to offer failsafe guidance for the correct and originally intended use of sacred plant medicines .\nThe celebrated Taoist teacher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taoist Inner View of the Universe , shares a map of the universal energy spectrum .\nThe chart illustrates that from the most subtle realms , [ those transcendent of time and space ] , to the physical , gross and insensitive realms , [ those bound by time and space ] .\nFrom the subtle origin and the celestial realms only the divine immortals extend through all the vibrational realms without modifying themselves .\nThey extend through those of the starry beings , of the mountain deities , of the numen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primal energies and elemental powers , and even through the realms of nature spirits , the human realms and the lower realms of ghosts , demons and sorcery realms .\nOnly the reality of the divine immortals , who are pure universal subtle law , pass through all the veils reaching through all the realms all the while remaining unchangeable .\nIt is for this reason that the divine immortals , the \u201c always new ones , \u201d the \u201c always fresh ones , \u201d the \u201c heaven people , \u201d \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 alone , are the unfailing guides of all time tested world heritage traditions , including the sacred plant spirit medicine traditions .\nThis unique quality of the divine immortals , remaining constant through a perpetual state of renewal , is unlike any of the realities in the realms bound by time and space , where any element will undergo modification when they enter either a higher or lower energetic realm .\nDeities can rise up to the immortal realms and descend to the realms of nature spirits .\nNature spirits can rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the realms of humans .\nHumans can rise to the realms of nature spirits and descend to the ghostly realms .\nAt the threshold of the realms , there are energetic barriers .\nIn order to pass through the veil and open the blockages , learning to concentrate one \u2019 s energy , adhering to the principles of universal subtle law and using one \u2019 s cultivated virtuous nature will allow one to open one \u2019 s inner blockages in order to pierce through the veils to perceive the ultimate realities .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtle law are requirements for making even the most minimal progress , let alone for accomplishing long lasting success .\nThe divine immortals , in their kindness and infinite grace , taught the first peoples a vastly diverse array of energy cultivation methods , so that people may evolve spiritually and recuperate the original and unspoiled nature enshrined within each human being .\nSacred plant medicine is one example among many of these time-tested world heritage traditions .\nThe sole purpose of the traditional drinking of ayahuasca and yag\u00e9 is for the participant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the divine immortals by meeting them , and to follow a heavenly way .\nBeing genuinely happy , loving and kind , embodying compassion and moderation , developing common sense and discernment , living simply , being selfless and service oriented , learning to heal and being able to orient people in their life path , are all merely side effects of following a celestial way of life .\nNow that the energy map is clear , allow me to elucidate some related insights into the daily energy clock in reference to sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand that ayahuasca is fundamentally a medical tradition ; not necessarily an enlightenment tradition .\nNotions of this carry forth in that ayahuasca is commonly referred to nowadays in western settings as \u201c medicine.\n\u201d In a traditional ayahuasca ceremony the *maestro \u201d ( graduated drinker ) directs the powers of spirits and it is the spirits who perform the healing .\nThe patients , if at all , rarely drink .\nAyahuasca does have healing properties in its ability to purge toxins and old stuck thoughts .\nHowever , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who accomplish the healing .\nTo learn this sacred art , old time ayahuasqueros would drink ayahuasca only after vigorous dietas ( energy concentration practices ) in order to prove the veracity of their discipline .\nAfter many dietas spanning extended periods of time , they gain wisdom and they learn to become selfless and they , from the divinities , learn the advanced arts of healing .\nNote : For further insights read Chapter 4 of Rainforest Medicine : Elements of the Experience , La Dieta : For Purification and Spiritual Mastery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person engaging in plant spirit medicine ceremony can ask is : In your ceremony , what spirits are you relating to ?\nThe subtle divine immortals are for the most part unconcerned with humanity \u2019 s variable nature .\nFor this reason , maestro ayahuasqueros use the elemental powers and nature spirits to heal .\nThese spirits are closer by , in the energy map , in the sense that they are bound by time , space , and thus consequently ~ duality .\nFor this reason , they can be capricious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to do good as well as harm .\nTo use and direct them only for the good is a holy art .\nA highly successful one at that , as once mastered , no illness stands a chance and many types of miraculous cures can be brought about .\nThis ability is achieved after rigorous dietas that first enable the healer to achieve communion with divine immortals , also referred to as heaven people .\nThere are rare cases where individuals have become masters of this sacred art after only one ceremony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes an extended period of time , suffering and discipline .\nOnly after communion with the heaven people is attained the individual associates with elemental energies .\nBefore that they are avoided at all cost , for if one first meets the elementals and nature spirits , it becomes much more difficult and laborious to meet the divine immortals .\nThe maestro whose authority stems from the heaven people , can keep the elementals in check ; for the sole purpose of healing .\nNow let \u2019 s look at the hourly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s precarious nature .\nFrom sunset to midnight is when the elemental energies become apparent , and from midnight to sunrise is when the celestial energies become apparent .\nAyahuasca ceremonies traditionally occur from sunset to midnight , for the purpose of using the elemental powers to heal .\nThis has been transferred to modern day settings , and people seem to think that just drinking the ayahuasca in and of itself and reciting healing songs or listening to recordings is sufficient for auspicious results , without the rigorous prior disciplining or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremonies , intended to introduce students to the celestial spirits , remain quiet until midnight or even up until the wee hours of dawn .\nParticipants drink strong brew throughout the night , all the while remaining quiet and observant , and avoid altogether the elemental powers that are always nearby.Then , at the wee hours of dawn , the ceremony begins .\nThe invocations , chanting and healings occur when the heaven people descend and enter the ceremonial lodge .\nWhen there is too much noise too early in the night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on invoking elemental energies ) are sung by people who haven \u2019 t undergone the disciplining to consecrate their relationship with divine immortals , or when the entirety of the icaro is not obtained and only unleashed are fragments of their purpose rather than the complete circle .\nIn some cases this can cause poisonous snakes and all types of insects to emerge on the surrounding landscape .\nThese types of disparities cause room for ayahuasca \u2019 s precarious nature to unfold .\nFurther risk factors include attitudes within the individual serving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of humility and not being selfless .\nThese can be expressed as , for example , wanting to feel important , being too opinionated , lacking patience to understand the entire scenario , being quick to cast judgment , holding onto judgments , projecting one \u2019 s character flaws onto others , seeing other people \u2019 s faults rather than one \u2019 s own , over committing and then not being able to keep one \u2019 s word , not being responsible for one \u2019 s actions , desiring other people \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling jealousy , being greedy , trying to control what might be taking place , having and acting upon sensual feelings for others in the ceremony , needing to be liked , longing to be loved , etc , etc\u2026 .\nIn order to continually use sacred plant medicine in an auspicious way , being upright , following an integral way of life and being absolute in one \u2019 s sincerity in staying on the path is the first step .\nSome risk factors can be very subtle , such as drinking ayahuasca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family member .\nBeing impulsive or reactionary when one should remain quiet .\nSaying something at the wrong time .\nShining a flashlight into someone \u2019 s face or accidentally bumping into them , moving into their auric field to help without being asked to help , or interrupting other meditators concentration .\nActing sympathetic to someone \u2019 s suffering while holding a hidden agenda , divulging one \u2019 s visions rather than expressing them through service , accepting things from others or from spirits in an out of context fashion .\nbelieving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not being sincere , all the while thinking one is being truthful thus forgetting to remember that to the spirits , one \u2019 s thoughts are louder than thunder !\nAll these are waverings from the celestial way that is unattached and ever present to serve in an absolute and selfless manner , invite susceptibility to manipulation by the spirits .\nDeviation from the path most often happens outside of one \u2019 s awareness .\nIt happens with a swift instant .\nThis is why the torchbearers of the tradition always tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call your name , do not go.\n\u201d A whole lot can be unpacked from this adage of the elders !\nThen there is the issue of contraindicated medications and foods , aged cheese and alcoholic beverages , too much mixing of different types of drugs and entheogens , brews not well prepared , space not well set , and bodies not ready for the experience .\nAll these contribute to ayahuascas \u2019 precarious nature to make itself known .\nThere is also an entirely different theme of discussion as well , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as : eating food prepared by a menstruating or pregnant woman after coming down from the ayahuasca or yag\u00e9 experience , drinking within several days of having had a wet dream or having ejacualted sperm , men drinking from the same cup as the facilitator or tying up hammocks if his wife is pregnant , holding judgment towards the facilitator , looking for something wrong outside oneself , and not surrendering to the experience , as these are believed to bid for the healing energies to snap .\nThe spirits that do harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infiltrate ceremonies due to the facilitator \u2019 s lack of rectitude and ability to create a safe container to protect the participants .\nTrickster spirits abound , and are sly beyond measure , but not to the natural surveillance of those with experience and whose virtues are intact .\nA good facilitator protects the ceremonial space and supports the intention of encountering the celestial spirits .\nThey can create a celestial shield where no harm can enter and participants can experience the glory of heaven .\nThey have studied how this is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c house of the immortals.\n\u201d In the context of modern day usage , no matter how well intentioned , it is much easier to unintentionally permit these spirits to tamper with your and other people \u2019 s minds than one might assume .\nThey are a thousand times more savvy than the strong willed may admit .\nIn one quick instant you \u2019 re worshiping the god of thoughts , and you \u2019 re not even aware that that \u2019 s what \u2019 s happening .\nAnd the questions arise : are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nAre your thoughts even yours ?\nBefore you can say the word cheese , you have participated in adding to planetary chaos .\nYou have left the golden path of the constructive cycle and entered the controlling or destructive cycles .\nThis is an utter simplification of a vastly far reaching conversation .\nIt is crucial to remember that the essence of a successful ceremony is when no integration at all is needed .\nAll the participants have been fully integrated by the ceremony \u2019 s closure , for this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unity of all things and recognize that separation is an illusion , and to cultivate an absolute way of being .\nWe can now see why it is so important to be sincere and to follow the guidelines so as to avoid the unnecessary pitfalls that at any given time can present themselves .\nIn this way we avoid stimulating the precarious nature of what is otherwise is originally intended to be a catalyst for all that is good !\nJonathon Miller Weisberger is the author or Rainforest Medicine : Preserving Indigenous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and

Became a Force in the Modern World If there is a central religious doctrine for the New Age , surely it is this \u2013 the belief that positive thoughts can bend reality to their own shape .\nIt is an alluring concept .\nIf it \u2019 s true , we don \u2019 t need to act or work or perform in the world .\nAll we need to do is change our thinking .\nBut is there anything to this idea ?\nTo understand something about the doctrine of thought power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its history .\nThe father of the religion of positive thinking was an obscure New Englander named Phineas Parkhurst Quimby ( 1802\u201366 ) .\nQuimby , like many men of his time , was a jack of all trades .\nHe started as a clockmaker , but eventually became fascinated with alternative methods of healing and learned the art of mesmerism or animal magnetism , a forerunner of hypnosis .\nQuimby found that if he put an assistant into a trance , the assistant could diagnose and prescribe a remedy for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edgar Cayce , the celebrated \u201c sleeping prophet \u201d who lived a couple of generations later ) .\nQuimby built up a successful practice this way , but soon he came to a startling conclusion : it didn \u2019 t matter what remedy was prescribed ; it was the faith of the patient that made the difference .\nSo Quimby dismissed his assistant and began to practice his own radical method of healing , in which he would simply convince the patient that he or she was already well .\nQuimby \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of confidence .\nHis office filled with patients , and many came away from his treatments feeling great relief or even fully cured .\nHe often treated people for free when they could not pay .\nA self-taught man , Quimby was not a systematic thinker .\nBut around 1859 , he began to formulate his teachings in writing .\nHe believed he had discovered the secret of the miracles performed by Jesus Christ , and he wished to make this knowledge available to all .\n\u201c My philosophy , \u201d he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent of all creeds and laws of man , and subject him to his own agreement , he being free from the laws of sin , sickness , and death.\n\u201d The teaching was simple .\nIn each human being resides Truth , Wisdom , and Goodness .\nThis is our natural birthright .\nBut there is also another aspect : the mortal , material mind that is subject to error .\nAnd the chief error to which this material mind is subject is disease .\n\u201c Disease , \u201d Quimby wrote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom is health and happiness .\nFalse reasoning is sickness and death.\n\u201d Quimby never really gave a name to his teaching , though he usually called it the \u201c Science of Health.\n\u201d Once or twice in his writings he referred to it as \u201c Christian Science.\n\u201d Quimby attracted a number of disciples .\nOne of them , Warren Felt Evans , was also a follower of the Swedish visionary Emanuel Swedenborg ( 1688-1772 ) .\nIt was in fact Evans who introduced the term \u201c New Age \u201d in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Its Messenger .\nThe \u201c messenger \u201d of the title was Swedenborg , who in his voluminous writings proclaimed 1757 as the year of the Last Judgment .\nBut this event , he said , did not and was not supposed to take place on earth .\nIt was enacted in the realm of the spirits , an intermediate zone between heaven and hell .\nThe Lord purged this realm of evil , making it possible for heaven to transmit its influences to earth in a less impeded fashion .\nSwedenborg did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it would later emerge : he held that the human mind was continually subject to influences from both heaven and hell and that the function of the human being on earth was to choose the good and renounce the evil impulses .\nEven so , Swedenborg \u2019 s thought , which reached the zenith of its influence in the early nineteenth century , prepared the ground for the New Age movement .\nAfter Quimby \u2019 s death in 1866 , his ideas lived on in the teachings of his most famous pupil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name \u201c Christian Science \u201d and created a religion around it , as well as in subsequent movements such as New Thought , Unity , and Religious Science .\nNew Thought is something of a blanket term used to cover these other movements in contradistinction to Eddy \u2019 s Christian Science .\nThe American scholar of religions Charles Braden characterised the chief differences between these two strains as follows : 1 ) Christian Scientists tend to be more authoritarian in their thinking , regarding Mrs. Eddy \u2019 s writings as definitive revelations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that spiritual truths are being revealed every day ; 2 ) Christian Scientists have tended toward denial \u2013 disease , matter , and \u201c mortal mind \u201d do not exist \u2013 whereas the New Thought movement has inclined more toward affirmations ( \u201c I am well \u201d ; \u201c I am perfect \u201d ) ; 3 ) Christian Scientists are generally opposed to working with traditional physicians or allowing their patients to do so , whereas proponents of New Thought have been more flexible and pragmatic on this count.1 One of the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentieth century was Religious Science , founded by Ernest Holmes ( 1887-1960 ) .\nBorn in Maine , Holmes moved to Boston as a teenager where he took a two-year course in public speaking .\nAt this time he was drawn to the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson ( another major influence on the New Thought movement ) , as well as to Eddy \u2019 s textbook of Christian Science , Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures .\nLater he would study other major figures in the New Thought movement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Troward .\nIn 1914 , Holmes moved to Venice , California .\nIn 1919 , he published his first book , Creative Mind .\nHis magnum opus , Science of Mind , was first published in 1926 .\nThough most of Holmes \u2019 s ideas can be found in his nineteenth-century precursors , he offered a slicker version of New Thought in his thoroughly twentieth-century salesmanship .\nHe liked to tell stories of persuading homely girls to smile ; when their lips parted , he claimed , they were surrounded by rich men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nGail Thain Parker , a scholar of New Thought , writes , \u201c Holmes \u2019 s smugness is very different from the more exploratory ( and sometimes evasive ) tone of the first- and second-generation mind curists\u2026 .\nHe knew that nothing he would say would shock or surprise ; his prose was full of lifetime warranties and unbeatable bargains.\n\u201d 2 Holmes , a powerful speaker but an ambivalent guru , nevertheless suffered his disciples to set up an organisation to promote his ideas .\nThe Institute of Religious Science and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1927 .\nIn the same year Holmes also founded Science of Mind magazine , which is still published today .\nHis influence was enormous , not only through his own writings but through those who were inspired by him .\nNorman Vincent Peale , author of The Power of Positive Thinking , a best-seller of the mid-twentieth century , drew much of his message from Religious Science .\nHolmes lived long enough to see his organisation subject to schisms and infighting .\nShortly before Holmes \u2019 s death , his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Obadiah Harris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Philosophical Research Society in Los Angeles ) confided to him that he was leaving the movement to find his own path .\n\u201c I wish I could go with you , \u201d Holmes replied.3 Even so , Holmes \u2019 s organisation survives to this day , and his teachings continue to inspire many .\nOne of his central \u2013 and perhaps his most influential \u2013 ideas is the Law of Attraction .\nThe term was originally coined in the nineteenth century to refer to the soul \u2019 s affinity for different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it its current meaning : \u201c What we shall attract will depend on that on which our thoughts dwell.\n\u201d 4 If you think of prosperity , prosperity will come your way ; if your thoughts dwell on disease , suffering , and misfortune , you are laying the ground for your own future unhappiness .\nThese thoughts are not necessarily conscious ones , Holmes contended : \u201c While most disease must first have a subjective cause , this subjective cause ( nine times out of ten ) is not conscious in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it , but is perhaps largely the result of certain combinations of thinking .\nSo while it is true that disease has its prototype in subjective mind , it is also true that the individual who suffers from the disease , frequently has never thought he was going to have that particular kind of trouble .\nBut this does not alter the fact that every disease which comes up through subjectivity , and appears in the body , must come through mind.\n\u201d 5 Healing , by contrast , comes from right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before .\nHolmes taught his followers to heal in this way : \u201c First recognise your own perfection , then build up the same recognition for your patient .\nYou are then read to directly attack the thought that binds him , recognising that your word destroys it , and stating that it does .\nYou may then take into account and specifically mention everything that needs to be changed , every so-called broken law or false thought .\nThen finish your treatment with a realisation of peace , remaining for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is done , complete and perfect.\n\u201d 6 Holmes said that the human mind was composed of two aspects : the \u201c subjective \u201d or \u201c subconscious \u201d mind on the one hand and the \u201c objective \u201d or \u201c conscious \u201d mind on the other .\nThe subjective mind is not conscious but is creative ; it is \u201c that part of the mind which is set in motion as a creative thing in the conscious state.\n\u201d The subjective \u201c sets power in motion in accordance with the thought.\n\u201d 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct the subconscious toward positive goals .\nA similar view can be found in the writings of Max Freedom Long , who , in such books as The Secret Science behind Miracles , taught an almost identical system that he traced back to the kahunas , the shamans of Hawaii .\nAccording to Long , the Hawaiians used the word unihipili to describe what Holmes called the \u201c subjective mind \u201d and the word uhane as more or less equivalent to Holmes \u2019 s \u201c conscious \u201d or \u201c objective mind.\n\u201d Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d in a metaphysical context , it is unlikely that Holmes or Long influenced each other ; rather these similarities show how thoroughly these ideas pervaded the alternative spirituality of early twentieth-century America .\nBy contrast , a work called The Kybalion , first published in 1908 , was a likely influence on Holmes ( see accompanying article ) .\nThe title page of this anonymous work lists its authors merely as \u201c Three Initiates.\n\u201d The Chicago occultist William Walker Atkinson is generally acknowledged to have been one of these ; Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order known as Builders of the Adytum , is also sometimes suggested as one of the others.8 In any event , The Kybalion \u2013 its name allegedly going back to the Egyptian mysteries , although its meaning was supposedly lost \u2013 set forth seven principles of metaphysical truth , the first being \u201c the principle of mentalism \u201d \u2013 \u201c The Universe is mental \u2013 held in the Mind of the all\u2026.the Universe and all It contains , is a mental creation of The all.\n\u201d 9 Compare this to Holmes \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the universe , and where we use it , it becomes our law because we have individualised it.\n\u201d 10 ( The similarities extend to the printing of both sentences in all capital letters . )\nSince the universe was \u201c mental \u201d in its essence , Holmes prescribed what today is called \u201c creative visualisation \u201d as a means of attaining well-being .\nHere is his advice to someone who is seeking success in business : \u201c Every day he should see his place filled with people .\nSee them looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; see them comparing prices and realising that he is offering good values ; see them delighted with the service he is giving\u2026 .\nMake a mental picture of it all .\nWe are dealing with Intelligence , and we should recognise the Power we are working with \u2013 realising our Oneness with it \u2013 and then we should ask for what we wish and take it.\n\u201d 11 A related approach is affirmation .\nLike the ancient Semites , who believed in a mystical unity between a word and the thing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word held the power to transform reality , and he included affirmations as part of his prescribed practice .\nHe recommended making this statement , for example , as part of a \u201c treatment \u201d for \u201c supply \u201d : \u201c I always have an abundance of money and an abundance of whatever it takes to make life happy and opulent .\nThere is a continuous movement toward me of supply , of money , of all that I need to express the fullest life , happiness and action.\n\u201d 12 Anthropologists have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magic uses certain techniques such as incantation , sacrifice , and ritual as a way of manipulating unseen powers .\nReligion often uses the same methods but it does so as a way of supplicating God or the gods through prayer and meditation .\nMagic is a kind of sacred technology , while religion usually involves a relationship to a personal deity .\nScience of Mind \u2013 and the religion of positive thinking as a whole \u2013 is much closer to magic than to religion .\nWhile it does not prescribe arcane rituals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manipulate the primordial force of the universe \u2013 mind \u2013 on the practitioner \u2019 s behalf .\nThere is no theological problem in this from a New Thought perspective , because God is all-good and all-loving and wants us to live in health and abundance ; our failure to do so is simply the result of faulty thinking and a failure to claim our due .\nThe constant use of the word \u201c Science \u201d by figures from Quimby to Holmes underlines the quasi-technological mindset that operates in these teachings , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial age that gave them birth : mind is an impersonal force that can be harnessed in much the same way as steam or electricity .\nWhile New Thought and Religious Science insist that they are part of a tradition that has always been known to adepts \u2013 the healing miracles of Jesus are frequently cited as cases in point \u2013 there is comparatively little in traditional esotericism that resembles these teachings .\nCertainly it has long been taught , particularly by Plato and his philosophical descendants , that there is an ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the higher intellect and that serve as prototypes for the things of materiality .\nBut the teaching that someone can not only perceive these archetypes but manipulate them to change physical reality is extremely rare .\nThe traditional view was that a true philosopher did not care about the material world and occupied himself as little as possible with it .\nEven the occultism of the Renaissance , with its cumbrous magical technology , did not lay any particular emphasis upon thought power .\nAccording to Renaissance savants such as Paracelsus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the higher dimensions , but does so by operating upon their corresponding objects in the physical world .\nTo bring down beneficent solar or jovial influences , one wears stones or eats herbs that are associated with these benign influences .\nMagical formulae were also employed , but not as affirmations \u2013 many of these incantations consist of words in no known language \u2013 and the goal was often to subject spirits and demons to the magician \u2019 s will .\nThe world of traditional magic is thus very far removed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science and its kin .\nTo speculate wildly for a moment , perhaps this is one sign of the New Age proclaimed by Swedenborg and Evans \u2013 that what formerly required intricate spells and bizarre operations can now be accomplished by using the power of the mind and the spoken word .\nThis , of course , assumes that the methods of Religious Science actually work , and such claims are hard to assess .\nCertainly there are any number of people who have been willing to testify on behalf of these procedures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously enough .\nBut we have no way of knowing how many of them there are as opposed to the numbers of those who have tried and failed .\nMost of the people I have known through New Thought circles appear no richer , happier , healthier , or more successful than much of the rest of humanity .\nAnd while I have known people who have gotten rich over the years \u2013 some of them staggeringly rich \u2013 their secret was probably not affirmations or thought power but the usual combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck \u2013 and , indeed , enormous quantities of all three .\nNonetheless , the claims of the thought power gurus from Quimby to Holmes ( not to mention latter-day figures such as the entity known as Abraham , channelled by Esther Hicks , and Rhonda Byrne , author of The Secret ) can not be dismissed wholesale .\nThought power , like so many aspects of the metaphysical realm , occupies a liminal space between truth and falsity .\nAs soon as you have decided it is all nonsense , something pokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may not be nonsense after all .\nBut if you become an enthusiastic believer , you may end up disappointed .\nTo speak personally , I would be willing to say this much .\nThe basic idea behind positive thinking is true : there is a mental world that underlays the physical , and thoughts can influence events in ways that can seem bizarre or even paranormal .\nBut the interplay of thought and actuality is not entirely explained by a few simplistic axioms and the usual lifetime warranties .\nOther factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming forces that are sometimes called fate and destiny ; the actions of a mind that can not always be understood , much less manipulated , by the conscious ego ; and of course the \u201c time and chance \u201d that , the Bible reminds us , \u201c happeneth to all \u201d ( Eccl .\n9:11 ) .\nTo the extent that positive thinking and mental science help us focus upon our goals and eliminate negative mental patterns , they can be useful .\nBut they are usually not very effective substitutes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-centred attitude that focuses on \u201c my \u201d prosperity and \u201c my \u201d health , or , still worse , dismisses the suffering of others on the grounds that somehow they brought it all upon themselves by wrong thinking , these ideas can cause serious trouble .\nWe must never lose sight of the fact that the power of thought includes the power to enslave the mind .\nAnd the ultimate goal of liberation may not be to make our thoughts manifest in the world of desire , but to free ourselves from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this

"content": "Ancient Apocalypse & Graham Hancock \u2019 s \u2018 Dangerous Ideas \u2019 \u2013 Why has the popular Netflix documentary ignited the ire of the media ?\nIt never ceases to amaze me what seemingly innocuous ideas the establishment media find \u2018 dangerous \u2019 or \u2018 controversial \u2019 .\nNetflix recently released an eight-part documentary series titled Ancient Apocalypse , where Graham Hancock ( who has a been a household name for \u201c alternative archeology \u201d since the release of his book \u2018 Fingerprints of the Gods \u2019 in 1995 ) , introduces us to his central theory that human civilisation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that most evidence for this was wiped out by a colossal natural disaster around 12,000 years ago .\nHe supports this theory with physical evidence for such a natural disaster , curious geological anomalies and seemingly ancient megalithic structures .\nHe points out that the mainstream view of pre-history insists civilisation did not and had never existed before the year 4000BC , but that recent discoveries such as the Temple at Gobekli Tepe , which dates back to 9600BC call that mainstream view into question .\nHe also collates mythic stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world that all reference some massive , global catastrophe .\n( Floods , earthquakes , giant snakes in the sky , strange visitors from across the sea etc . )\nAnd then emphasises their many eerie similarities .\nThrough the collation of this research , Hancock then asks some questions of the mainstream view of our ancient history and posits a theory of his own \u2013 that \u2018 we are a species with amnesia \u2019 , who have forgotten our own past .\nThese are not new ideas , solely from Hancock \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very similar half a century ago , in fact his last book , published posthumously , was titled \u201c Mankind in Amnesia \u201d , and explored the psychological impact of us , as a species , repressing the memories and forgetting the stories that echo from a distant , traumatised past .\nThese questions might sound intriguing to you , or you may be indifferent to them , or you may even vehemently disagree with them , but I bet you didn \u2019 t know they were racist , did you ?\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t believe me , you conspiracy theorist ?\nJust ask the Guardian .\nYes , the Graun has spoiled us with not just one hit-piece , but two !\nAll in the space of one week .\nRobin McKie writes his from an archaeological standpoint , while Stuart Heritage speaks as an entertainment critic .\nHowever , one is very much like the other .\nThey both agree the Netflix series is wholly unacceptable .\nAll of it .\nThese are \u2018 dangerous ideas \u2019 that shouldn \u2019 t be \u2018 allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims reinforce \u2018 white supremacist ideas \u2019 , because questioning the age of human civilisation There we have it , you see !\nDon \u2019 t even bother linking to any sources , Robin ( which he doesn \u2019 t ) .\nI hear you , loud and clear .\nThe idea of Atlantis is inherently racist , because the Nazis believed in it .\nThe fact Hancock never mentions race , or white people ( or aliens ) in the series , nor ( to the best of my knowledge ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference to this .\nSo , what are you going to do now ?\nKeep researching the Atlantis myth ?\nOf course , going by this logic , we should really do away with Christianity as well .\nGod in general , in fact .\nPerhaps we should cancel Volkswagen and Wagner too .\nNazis also brushed their teeth and wore shoes , I believe , neither of which shall I be taking part in from this day onwards , just to be sure .\nSo , there we have it \u2013 Ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never mentions race .\nThe remainder of their twin critiques are no better argued or supported by reality .\nHere is a typical example of the intellectual level they work on : It was this opening paragraph alone that prompted my response .\nAs it is so uniquely meaningless .\nWhat does he mean by \u2018 For a story 2,300 years old it has demonstrated remarkable persistence \u2019 ?\nAs opposed to what ?\nAll those other stories that we don \u2019 t know about ?\nHow is that measurable , exactly ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories and mythologies dating back two and half thousand years , and even much further into the past than that .\nIncluding all the Greco-Roman myths , plays by Sophocles and Aesop \u2019 s Fables .\nWe have detailed legends and lore passed down from Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia .\nThe Old Testament fits the bill as well .\nAnd of course , Homer \u2019 s Iliad , which describes the fabled Trojan War .\nLet us remember that the City of Troy was also believed to have been just a myth until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd I \u2019 m sure before 1870 , when it was first discovered , that there was no shortage of academics decrying the search for Troy as a heretical waste of time .\nSimplicity itself !\nThe reason the Atlantis myth is so popular is because it \u2019 s so popular !\nRobin then asserts as fact that Plato intended the tale of Atlantis to be little more than an allegory .\nThere is no way of knowing that , of course , he merely asserts it and then goes into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFirstly , Graham Hancock never \u2018 argues \u2019 that the Greek island of Santorini was struck by an errant comet .\nThat is misleading .\nHe argues that a comet struck somewhere in North America and rising sea levels may have obliterated an island civilisation ( that Plato calls Atlantis ) in the Atlantic Ocean .\nIt \u2019 s only you , Robin , who is conflating this Atlantis myth with Santorini .\n[ NB \u2013 Robin also fails to mention the physical evidence for just such an impact at the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should we not give credit where credit is due , and assume that Plato ( and Solon , from whom Plato got the story , and the Dynastic Egyptians , from whom Solon got the story ) , most likely knew the difference between \u2018 inside the Mediterranean \u2019 and \u2018 outside the Mediterranean \u2019 ?\nIf they place Atlantis beyond the Pillars of Hercules , should we not at least consider it possible that this is indeed where \u201c the original Atlantis \u201d was ?\n( I invite readers to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what you make of it , here is an unabridged and well-produced reading . )\nThe history of Santorini \u2019 s volcanic eruption was probably , by contrast , relatively well known .\nSantorini didn \u2019 t actually sink , after all , as Atlantis is said to have done .\nIt \u2019 s still there .\nThe Ancient Greeks called it \u2018 Thera \u2019 and they were perfectly well aware of its existence .\nIt shares no cultural , historical or technological similarities to Plato \u2019 s description of Atlantis at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island \u2019 .\nBut none of that bothers McKie who at this point , and without ceremony , just sort of stops writing .\nJob Done .\nAtlantis debunked .\nWhat \u2019 s for lunch ?\nMoving on to Stuart Heritage \u2019 s piece , which is thankfully briefer but in no way less smug .\nIn his subheading he boldly asks : I \u2019 m not sure which authority he \u2019 s calling on here .\nNetflix execs ?\nLocal , national or perhaps global government ?\nOr maybe it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord God himself how such evil could come into the world .\nBeyond this , Stuart seems even less interested in debunking or debating these \u2018 dangerous ideas \u2019 than McKie was , and far more focused on analysing and ridiculing its ( presumed ) target audience .\nFortunately , Stuart , with his view unbiased and his mind wide open , has discerned exactly who that is in the first five minutes \u2013 because he saw ( or thinks he saw ) Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson flash up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one quick interview , which is used in the first episode and the last .\nJordan Peterson does not appear in this documentary at all .\nAnd I \u2019 m really not sure why Stuart thought he did .\nPerhaps he just didn \u2019 t watch closely enough to realise this before rushing his five-hundred words off to be published in one of the largest news outlets in the world .\nMore notably when Heritage later amended the change , he just removed the \u2018 Jordan Peterson \u2019 reference and neither he nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct the syntax : Just \u2018 a different person \u2019 .\nIt \u2019 s not important who anymore .\nHe \u2019 s not on the Guardian \u2019 s \u2018 naughty list.\n\u2019 Equally strangely , both McKie and Heritage seem to think \u2018 Ancient Apocalypse \u2019 makes claims of \u2018 super intelligent beings \u2019 and \u2018 aliens \u2019 , when it simply does not .\nHancock \u2019 s argument \u2013 whether you accept it or not \u2013 is that human beings were more advanced than academia admits .\nNot robots with flying cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them credit for , and he cites evidence for this which both Stuart & Robin ignore in favour of critiquing Hancock for things he does not say .\nThey cite no sources and debate no actual claims .\nThey use buzzwords and identity politics in place of analysis and between the two of them couldn \u2019 t fill one page of A4 .\nIt \u2019 s as if even they ( and their editors ) had no faith or interest in what they were doing .\nAlthough Stuart does rather give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He \u2019 s got me stumped there .\nBecause , for the life of me , I literally can \u2019 t think of anything worse than \u2018 believing in election fraud \u2019 , which is obviously as fanciful as believing in the Loch Ness Monster .\nWhat next ?\nBelieving in tax evasion !\n?\nPresumably he \u2019 s referring to the 2020 US election .\nBecause the Guardian has claimed fraud is very real in some elections .\nRussia , Syria , Bolivia , Brazil , Libya , Afghanistan , Iran and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were pretty darn adamant that it was Russian collusion that got Trump into office in 2016 .\nStuart presumably believes election fraud is only a \u2018 conspiracy theory \u2019 when it happens here , in the UK .\nEither that or he believes it has literally never happened .\nEver .\nIn the whole history of the world .\nOr perhaps he \u2019 s simply typing up any old nonsense just to get that word count a little higher .\nSense and consistency be damned .\nHowever , the fragile honesty underlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially saying : \u201c If people become sceptical of one thing , they may become sceptical of another.\n\u201d Which is to be expected , but what I can \u2019 t understand is how anybody could think this is a bad thing .\nPeople should be sceptical .\nScepticism in all things but cynicism in none .\nPeople should ask questions , and they should expect answers , especially from those who profess to know them .\nOne should be open-minded and always pursue the truth .\nAnd to better decipher what that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ideas , questioning the mainstream view and challenging the established narrative as new evidence presents itself .\nWe need that .\nScience , progress and discovery all depend on it .\nEven if the ideas turn out to be false .\nProve them false .\nIn short : No one should be the gatekeepers of our history .\nLeast of all those who laud their certitude in the face of the unknowable .\nThe mystery is exciting .\nThe evidence is compelling .\nThe series is engaging .\nEven if none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the questions are still worth asking .\nThese ideas are only \u2018 dangerous \u2019 if you fear what they question .\nAnd those who fear questions fear the truth .\nJR Leach is a fantasy author and graphic designer whose debut novel The Farmer and the Fald was published earlier this year .\nYou can follow him on Twitter or Substack and see more of his

psychiatric meds .\nYou see , we live in a hyper-communicative environment , and we \u2019 re bombarded by an exceptional amount of messages and mediums practically every moment of everyday .\nThere is an insane amount of information coming at you , and most of it is intended to influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the messenger .\nThis is the essence of mind control : influence someone \u2019 s thoughts , and you influence their behavior .\nEvery bit of media that you allow to enter your consciousness influences your thoughts and/or beliefs in very real ways .\nIf you let it , that is .\nBut most of us consume media in a very passive state of consciousness .\nEither in the background while doing something else , or after a long day when the brain is exhausted and your will power has been sapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestions are absorbed by the subconscious mind where they go to work changing beliefs about the world and what you need in order to survive in it .\nThe key to maintaining sovereignty of your own mind is in being aware of just how real this impact is .\nWhen you look back at the dawn of this era of mass communication , you find that as the technology of radio , television and film evolved , so did the scientific understanding of how these new mediums could be used to achieve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media for profit or propaganda .\nThe so-called father of modern propaganda , Edward Bernays ruminates in 1928 about the need to control the habits and behaviors of democratized citizens .\nHe asserts this as a responsibility of those in power .\nBernays was Sigmund Freud \u2019 s nephew , and was heavily influenced by Freud , steering his research in the direction of manipulative psychology .\nThey developed what is essentially the crux of modern advertising , which is the ability to unlock one \u2019 s desires through messaging and imagery .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens into consumers and obedient workers , taxpayers and soldiers .\n\u201c Who are the men who without our realizing it , give us our ideas , tell us whom to admire and whom to despise , what to believe about the ownership of public utilities , about the tariff , about the price of rubber , about the Dawes Plan , about immigration ; who tell us how our houses should be designed , what furniture we should put in them , what menus we should serve on our table , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what sports we should indulge in , what plays we should see , what charities we should support , what pictures we should admire , what slang we should affect , what jokes we should laugh at ?\n\u201d ~ Edward Bernays , Propaganda But where is all this going if we choose not to wake up and actively participate in the creation of our future ?\nAldous Huxley had a serious warning for us on this , calling out the subtle forces of social engineers that were emerging at the highest levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World was published in 1931 , and Huxley has been proven right .\nNow the tools are far more complex , and also far more in your face at every turn .\nTwo time Pulitzer Prize winning author and influential propagandist , Walter Lippmann , spoke about how the public is basically a dumb wild beast that needs to be domesticated .\n\u201c Walter Lippmann , an American intellectual , writer and two-time Pulitzer Prize winner brought forth one of the first works concerning the usage of mass media in America .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared the masses to a \u201c great beast \u201d and a \u201c bewildered herd \u201d that needed to be guided by a governing class .\nHe described the ruling elite as \u201c a specialized class whose interests reach beyond the locality.\n\u201d This class is composed of experts , specialists , and bureaucrats .\nAccording to Lippmann , the experts , who often are referred to as \u201c elites , \u201d are to be a machinery of knowledge that circumvents the primary defect of democracy , the impossible ideal of the \u201c omnicompetent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewildered herd \u201d has its function : to be \u201c the interested spectators of action , \u201d i.e .\nnot participants .\nParticipation is the duty of \u201c the responsible man \u201d , which is not the regular citizen.\n\u201d ~Vigilant Citizen Here , Lippmann talks about the beneficial impacts of propaganda : \u201c That the manufacture of consent is capable of great refinements no one , I think , denies

longer possible , for example , to believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knowledge needed for the management of human affairs comes up spontaneously from the human heart .\nWhere we act on that theory we expose ourselves to self-deception , and to forms of persuasion that we can not verify .\nIt has been demonstrated that we can not rely upon intuition , conscience , or the accidents of casual opinion if we are to deal with the world beyond our reach.\n\u201d ~Walter Lippmann , Public Opinion And now , with nearly everyone walking around with a smartphone , you must realize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @

of perception.\n\u2019 This is why so much of our modern societies and the media marketplace are filled with pop-spirituality as they function as cultural remedies rather than revolutions .\nThat is , they provide a band aid plaster rather than seeking to find a permanent cure .\nMany easy \u2018 self-help \u2019 practices offer a \u2018 false exit \u2019 revolving door so that people are given the sensation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system \u2019 only to be brought back into it again .\nSuch teachings or offerings act as auto-tranquilizers \u2013 they act as auto-tranquilizing mechanisms to provide an alternative treatment , or pleasing sensation , that appears as fringe or \u2018 outside \u2019 the system but is not .\nRather , it is another sub-set within the overall program ; but a subset that does not constitute a threat or provide a means to perceive through the programmed reality set .\nIn other words , it is an allowed anomaly .\nThe \u2018 allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental anesthesia that soften or even dispel the original urge to seek for answers .\nThey also serve as a quick satiation ( fast food ) to bring temporary satisfaction .\nTemporary satiation , or satisfaction , dulls down

opportunity now available compels us to become something qualitatively new .\nThis is now the perfect time for personal advancement and for the expansion of perception and awareness .\nIt is no longer necessary to be clever \u2013 it is essential to be wise .\nThere has been a noticeable decline in what , in simple terms , may be called the \u2018 metaphysical quest \u2019 ( what has also been known as the \u2018 spiritual quest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek beyond material-physical appearances has almost vanished from contemporary life .\nIt was long ago co-opted into religious pursuits and fashioned

with exotic interests .\nThe glamour of \u2018 self-development \u2019 has found a wanting marketplace within the glare of social media .\nThe depth of inner longing is scratched at the surface and satisfied by sipping at the singing bowls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is all too easy to become stereotypes of ourselves , driven by platitudes of false mysticism and superficial attainment .\nThere is so much

@ @ us ponder on our predicament by concluding with the following tale : The Fruit of the Tree An ancient tale tells how a wise man once related a story about a remarkable tree which was to be found in India .\nPeople who ate of the fruit of this tree , as he told it , would neither grow old nor die .\nThis legend was repeated , by a reliable person , to one of the Central Asian kings of long ago , and this monarch at once conceived a passionate desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Elixir of Life .\nSo the King sent a suitably resourceful representative to find and to bring back the fruit of that tree .\nFor many years the emissary visited one city after another , travelled all over India , town and country , and diligently asked about the object of his search from anyone who might know about its nature and where it was to be found .\nAs you can imagine , some people told this man that such a search must obviously only be a madman \u2019 s quest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out how a person of such evident intelligence could actually be involved in such an absurd adventure ; their kindness in this respect , showing their consideration for him as a deluded dupe , hurt him even more than the physical blows which the ignorant had also rained upon him .\nMany people , of course , told him false tales , sending him from one destination to another , claiming that they , too , had heard of the miraculous Tree .\nYears passed in this way , until the King \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success , and made the decision to return to the royal court and confess his dismal failure .\nNow , there was also , luckily , a certain man of real wisdom in India \u2013 they do occasionally exist there \u2013 and the King \u2019 s man , having heard of him late in his search , thought ; \u2018 I will at least go

"title": "Silent Weapons for the Secret War on You", "content": "Silent Weapons for the Secret War on You The world of non-lethal weaponry has opened the door to technologies that allow the control of one \u2019 s mind , thoughts , actions , and behaviours via the use of pulsed high-frequency microwave blasts , electrical transmissions , and directed heat and sound waves .\nThese can bypass our regular inhibitors and enter the human body and brain unbeknownst to the targeted person until they suffer the consequences .\nIt \u2019 s been going on for decades and not just for war purposes , but to stop protests and riots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unruly crowds under control .\nFor years , law enforcement has been using non-lethal weapons , including LRAD \u2013 Long-Range Acoustic Device \u2013 which blasts sound waves to cease behaviour by temporarily disorienting the intended victims .\nBut while these devices serve practical and easily identifiable purposes for both military and law enforcement , there exists a more insidious use for this kind of technology .\nIn February of 2022 , alternative media reported on the use of LRAD during anti-vaccine mandate protests in Canberra .\nAustralian Federal Police admitted using the device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament House .\nA number of videos and images hit social media showing people with various injuries , such as heat sores , rashes , and what looked like allergy-induced welts .\nThere were also reports of sunburn and heatstroke symptoms , weakness , and temporary and permanent hearing damage .\nOne Nation Senator Malcolm Roberts and Liberal Senator Alex Antic brought the issue before the Senate after Roberts \u2019 office was inundated with complaints from protestors who had been at the rally .\nSenator Antic showed photos of a LRAD deployed beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took photos of LRAD speakers on cars near the rally sites , but the response was typical .\nThey were told that LRAD was only used to broadcast communications to the crowd .\nDespite the onslaught of injuries , there was a mocking tone to many of the responses to claims LRAD was used to debilitate the crowd .\nThe Conversation reported on 20 February 2022 that sonic weapons such as LRAD were used for \u201c crowd control and communication \u201d and that reports of injuries were \u201c inconsistent with what an LRAD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed at a Black Lives Matter protest in New South Wales .\nNSW Police responded to concerns by stating at a press conference that \u201c it was a normal loud-hailer.\n\u201d The first official application of LRAD happened in the year 2000 on the American guided-missile destroyer , USS Cole , when it was bombed by a small boat in a terrorist attack .\nNaval personnel on the Cole used LRAD to hail the boat but were unsuccessful .\nSince then , LRAD has become a staple weapon of choice used to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units were photographed with police during the Canadian Truck Convoy Freedom protests in Ottawa , Canada , in February 2022 .\nLRAD is often used in loudspeaker mode for crowd communications , but it can also be turned on in infrasound and ultrasound modes to cause different injuries and sicken and debilitate rioters or protestors .\nBecause we can not hear infrasound or ultrasound , we have no idea the weapon is being used on us until it \u2019 s too late .\nUsing a Long-Range Acoustic Device to direct sound has raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sound over 90 dB , which can damage a person \u2019 s hearing .\nBecause the LRAD beam doesn \u2019 t discriminate , anyone in its path will be injured , including innocent bystanders and children .\nIn an article , \u201c Did Police Use Sonic Weapons Against Australians Peacefully Protesting Covid Tyranny ?\n\u201d , Reignite Democracy Australia warned that the use of LRAD was \u201c another move towards militarised suppression of legal protests in Australia.\n\u201d They said this was an outrageous attack by the government on its people .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ out propaganda to suppress the story , but Canberra protesters used every social media outlet to show what was happening on the ground and , for them , how far democracy in Australia had fallen .\nIn September 2020 , Gizmodo reporter Matt Novak wrote an article titled \u201c U.S .\nTroops Asked About Using \u2018 Heat Ray \u2019 Weapon Against Protesters , According to Whistleblower.\n\u201d According to sworn testimony by said whistleblower , federal troops in Washington , D.C. considered using high-tech sound cannons and heat rays against protestors outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHeat weapons were nothing new in 2020 .\nActive Denial System ( ADS ) is the fancy name for using invisible microwave beams that cause incredible pain by burning the skin of people even at a distance .\nUS troops first used ADS in Iraq after the invasion in 2003 .\nSome speculate the US government uses them on their own soil .\nThe ADS produces scalding heat not designed to kill but to injure .\nLike sound weapons , heat weapons are considered non-lethal and meant to induce pain to disperse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the US Air Force and built by Raytheon Technologies , ADS can produce millimetre-wavelength bursts of energy , capable of penetrating 1/64 inch into human skin .\nThat is enough to agitate water molecules in the dermis and produce a burning sensation strong enough to stop a person from whatever they are doing .\nADS has a range of hundreds of metres and can be aimed like a searchlight .\nExtensive testing has shown that no human can withstand the beam for more than just a few seconds .\nDirected energy weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether in the form of light , sound , heat , electrical or kinetic , at a specific target or person .\nThese types of devices are not new .\nThe Russian LIDA Machine , which employs EM pulses to make a target exhausted or sleep-deprived , has been in use since before the 1980s .\nNews network CNN broadcast a special report on the work of Dr Ross Adey , who studied the LIDA Machine and appeared with one on the show .\nLIDA can pulse sound , light , and radiant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person in close proximity .\nAt that time , Adey and his colleague , Dr Eldon Byrd , were studying LIDA as a potential weapon .\nSome of the symptoms or indicators of a directed energy weapon attack allegedly include : \u2022 Sudden waking at exactly the same time at night , as if prompted by an external force \u2022 Hot stinging or needling sensations deep within the flesh , especially while attempting to sleep \u2022 Vibration of muscles and body parts or nearby immobile objects \u2022 Fast and pounding heartbeat and ringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat despite cool surroundings and lack of actual fever Directed-energy \u201c beam weapons \u201d harness light and radio waves as their form of ammunition .\nThe US military has been exploring this pulse energy weaponry for decades .\nA 2005 article on the MSNBC website , \u201c Despite Promise , Energy Beam Weapons Still Missing From Action , \u201d states that these pulses , which behave much like the phasers in Star Trek , can provide a precise , instantaneous and inexhaustible form of firepower on future battlefields \u2013 if the technology is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that now is the time that potential can be realised .\nIn early 2022 , the US Navy \u2019 s Naval Surface Warfare Center established a new division that focuses on research and development of high-power microwave ( HPM ) directed-energy weapons .\nOver the last five years , directed-energy weapons have been a high-level priority for the US Office of the Secretary of Defense , with funding for R & D roughly doubling over the period .\nOther countries admit they are also developing microwave weapons and high energy lasers .\nBoth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant development costs , but the cost per shot is extremely cheap compared to the multi-million-dollar cost of a missile .\nAccording to defence news reports , HPM can jam devices and physically destroy electrical systems .\nThese reports do not reveal what it does to a human body .\nAnother breaking news story on this front in 2022 was the announcement that directed energy microwave weapon systems could be placed on heavy-lift drones to shoot down drone swarms .\nDirected energy weapons may be the stuff of future battlefield strategies , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who report having been on the receiving end of such invisible warfare , these technologies are already being used to control , manipulate , terrorise , and harass off the battlefield .\nIn December 2016 , diplomats and CIA officials at the US Embassy in Havana , Cuba , reported mysterious symptoms that came on without warning .\nThese included headaches , fatigue , cognitive impairment , vision loss , hearing loss , vertigo , tinnitus , and loss of motor control .\nOver 200 other diplomats later reported experiencing some or all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US officials in Asia , Europe , Australia , and the United States .\nAccording to Nicholas Davis , writing in \u201c What is Havana Syndrome ?\n\u201d for American University in Washington , D.C. , in July of 2021 , victims described waves of pressure inside their heads , walls of sound , immense noises that sounded like swarms of cicadas in their brains\u2026 Sounds a lot like Voice To Skull [ see accompanying story in magazine ] .\nIn the years that followed , several theories and studies have ensued by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House , and medical experts working for or outside the government .\nThe consensus was that these are likely pulsed microwave attacks which could account for the symptoms ( another bizarre theory was pesticide exposure ) .\nEven 60 Minutes and New York Magazine put forth reports , as did many international news agencies , but all suggested the critical problem was analysing the data to find the root cause .\nFor example , 60 Minutes discussed a Stanford University report that looked at the nature of the brain injuries suffered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a professor of medicine at Stanford University , helped lead two government-sponsored panels investigating the injuries .\n\u201c What we found was , we thought , clear evidence of an injury to the auditory and vestibular system of the brain , \u201d Relman said .\n\u201c Everything , starting with the inner ear where humans perceive sound and sense balance and then translate those perceptions into brain electrical signals.\n\u201d One of the victims was former US Homeland Security Chief of Staff , Miles Taylor , who told 60 Minutes that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which smacks of the stories of the many targeted individuals who experience debilitating symptoms in their own homes or workplaces .\nRegarding the over 1,000 reports of Havana Syndrome , the US Department of Defense and Intelligence communities ultimately admitted they could not identify a \u201c foreign state actor or external device or mechanism to any of those cases.\n\u201d Was it some terrorist group or state actor , or the work of the United States testing its own weapon technology ?\nThe frightening thing is this technology allows those who possess it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state to individuals who speak out in protest against the government or its chosen narratives .\nMoreover , because these directed energy weapons can be activated via remote control at a source a distance away from the intended victim , it becomes a huge challenge to capture the perpetrators behind such attacks .\nConspiracy theorists , who lately have been seeing their \u201c theories \u201d become \u201c fact , \u201d concur on the microwave pulse origin of Havana Syndrome , even going so far as to warn of new EMF/5G/Microwave Pulse Weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first global lockdowns over COVID-19 in early 2020 , numerous countries allowed 5G towers to be erected despite the restrictions , with towers first going up in Wuhan , China , near the lab now considered the birthplace of the virus , as well as towns in Italy that first reported COVID cases , and subsequently throughout the United States and other nations .\nIt is up for debate whether this was the telecom industry taking advantage of the opportunity to put up towers near schools , hospitals , and homes without much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to erect a deadly grid of microwave energy that would one day be far more insidious than a virus .\nAuthor , researcher , and clinical scientist Dr. Robert O .\nYoung states that \u201c through-wall RADAR , \u2018 The Havana Method \u2019 or \u2018 The Havana Effect \u2019 , is a bullying and intimidation electromagnetic frequency [ EMF ] device on steroids to modify human behaviour and to force compliance by terrorising a person with pain and injury with the intent to incite , provoke and aggravate , and designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young further elaborates on the extent and power of such technology : \u201c When pulsed at 2.4 GHz ( microwaves ) and higher frequencies , at embassies , offices , homes and even humans containing GO [ graphite oxide ] , they can then specifically be used for \u2018 listening-in \u2019 espionage devices .\nThere is no need to do a \u2018 break and enter \u2019 to place a hidden microphone ; the eavesdropping can easily be accomplished by pulsing a microwave radio frequency ( MWRF ) signal into a building , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human with or without direct line of sight .\nThe device can pick up any conversations and locate anyone and everyone , anywhere in the world from any DEW [ directed energy weapon ] cell tower on land or over 20,000 DEW satellites from space.\n\u201d Back in 1975 , the United Nations General Assembly considered a draft proposed by the Soviet Union , \u201c Prohibition of the Development and Manufacture of New Types of Weapons of Mass Destruction and New Systems of Such Weapons.\n\u201d Among some of the latter weapons systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could produce effects similar to those of a nuclear explosion \u2022 Particle beam weapons using charged or neutral particles to affect biological targets \u2022 Electromagnetic weapons operating at certain radio-frequency radiations which would have injurious effects on human organs Unfortunately , the response from Western nations was no response .\nOther treaties , such as biological and chemical weapons bans ( both on the battlefield and in civilian streets ) , have been created and modified , but apparently not one that stops the invasion of the human mind or the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group harassment and behaviour control .\nAs these weapons use invisible forces of sound , heat , and frequency to create a new type of weapon for warfare utilised remotely , it is much easier for those with sinister intentions to not only get away with it but also defy treaties or laws .\nJudy Wall , editor and publisher of the 1990s newsletter Resonance , in an article titled \u201c Military Use of Silent Sound : Mind Control Weapons , \u201d claimed that psychological operations weaponry ( psyops ) was used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c subliminal , mind-altering technology\u2026 carried on standard radiofrequency broadcasts.\n\u201d News briefs in March 1991 admitted that psyops had been deployed once Saddam Hussein \u2019 s military command-and-control system was destroyed .\nA piece titled \u201c High-Tech Psychological Warfare Arrives in the Middle East \u201d described a psyops against Iraqi troops during Operation Desert Storm in which US transmitters overpowered local Iraqi stations and broadcast patriotic and religious music along with \u201c vague , confusing and contradictory military orders and information.\n\u201d Wall writes that this may have also included a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used \u201c a sophisticated electronic system to \u2018 speak \u2019 directly to the mind of the listener , to alter and entrain his brainwaves , to manipulate his brain \u2019 s electroencephalograph , i.e .\nEEG patterns , and artificially implant negative emotional states-feelings of fear , anxiety , despair and hopelessness.\n\u201d Perhaps that is why , as Wall notes , Iraqi troops later surrendered en masse , including majors and brigade commanders who gave up their entire units .\nWhat messages might have been coursing through the brains of these soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their cause and then suddenly gave up ?\nAuthor and independent researcher Elana Freeland , in her essay \u201c This Covert Electromagnetic Era : Directed Energy Weapons ( DEWs ) for Political Control , \u201d writes of the long history and current concerns over this technology , and how it is used on us in secretive ways that have nothing to do with fighting terrorism .\n\u201c It doesn \u2019 t take a rocket science degree to see that remote satellite tracking and over-the-horizon technologies are not just about \u2018 terrorists.\n\u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by neurophone questioning , and brain wave analysers delivering \u2018 forced conversations \u2019 and programming are about the establishment of electronic POW concentration camps in our homes and workplaces .\nThey \u2019 re about mental rape and intellectual property stolen right out of our thoughts\u2026 .\n\u201c Broadcast preparatory sets encoded on microwave beams produce heart attacks , strokes , paralysis , etc .\nIllnesses like flu are fired at targets .\nBuildings where dissident groups meet are turned into instantaneous hot spots .\nGovernment abductions are disguised as alien abductions with paralysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implanting false

stakes are much higher .\nFundamentally they are all questions about control .\nIn a society this controlling , it \u2019 s no wonder so many people can \u2019 t let go of their grip on false realities , and pressure others to conform to their point of view .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ I help people see what false realities they \u2019 ve made for themselves , and help them let go of their grip on useless beliefs .\n~Dylan Charles Society is directed by a never-ending mainstream narrative which is always evolving , and always reaching new dramatic peaks in sensationalism and hype .\nThey fill

mind which are yet undiscovered or are off-limits .\nIt is a vanishing art that is deliberately being stamped out by a control system which demands conformity , acquiescence and obedience of body , mind , and spirit .\nFor your consideration , here are three questions you \u2019 re not supposed to ask about life in our profoundly sick society .\n1. Who owns the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s debt ?\nPretty much the entire world is in financial debt , an insidious form of slavery which enables the exploitation of human beings and of all things in nature .\nIt \u2019 s maddening when you think about it .\nThe United States alone supposedly owes some $ 20 trillion , while the world at large owes a shocking $ 215 trillion ?\nBut to whom , precisely ?\nMoney is just a medium of exchange which facilitates transactions between people .\nIn and of itself it has no intrinsic value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea shells instead of dollar bills and still be able to get things done .\nBut today \u2019 s money is the property of private third-parties who rent it out to national governments , who then use the labor of their citizens as collateral against these loans .\nThis is a highly refined form of slavery , which has already put future unborn generations of human beings in debt .\nBut who , exactly does the human race owe ?\nWho are our debt-slave masters ?\nOwnership means having the explicit right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the manner of your choosing .\nThe one thing you are born with that you take with you to your death is your own body , but do you own it ?\nIf not you , then who does own your body ?\nIf this question were already settled in our society then there wouldn \u2019 t be ever-increasing pressure on those who choose to refuse vaccines .\nChildren battling cancer and other serious illnesses wouldn \u2019 t be forced to take chemo and radiation under penalty of law and under threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water wouldn \u2019 t be fluoridated without our consent .\nNatural medicines wouldn \u2019 t be outlawed under threat of fines and prison time .\nWe are rapidly approaching a time when people will be required by law to take psychotropic medications as citizens were in Aldous Huxley \u2019 s dystopian classic , Brave New World .\nDo you own your body , or does it belong to the state ?\n3 .\nWhy is the exploration of consciousness restricted and illegal ?\nThe most effective prisons are not material , but are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion and understanding are all dynamic concepts , not at all static .\nThese can all change in the blink of an eye just because a new idea or experience resonates with you in a special way .\nOur evolution depends on our ability to expand the frontiers of what \u2019 s possible , and when the mind is held in confinement by an entrenched system and powerful cultural paradigm , progress , even happiness , is stunted .\nIn this societal trap you are given free rein to debase your consciousness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pharmaceuticals , television , pornography , theatrical violence , and then some , yet many natural medicines which elevate consciousness and provide a window into the soul are illegal .\n\u201c This is the way freedom is hijacked\u2014not all at once , out in the open , but stealthily , little by little , behind closed doors , and with our own agreement .\nHow will we be able to resist when so many of us have already willingly handed over the keys to our own consciousness to the state and accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be told what we may and may not do , what we may and may not explore , even what we may and may not experience , with this most precious , sapient , unique , and individual part of ourselves ?\nIf we are willing to accept that then we can be persuaded to accept

robotics , which are being driven by ever-increasing computational speeds made possible by quantum computing .\nWhen the capacity of technological computation rivals the speed of our capacity to think

near future , we are also now learning how this very type of quantum creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world via the interplay of human consciousness and the material world .\nIn the early 1900 \u2019 s , the famous double-slit experiment demonstrated that material objects can actually change their composition based on what is being held in consciousness when said objects are observed .\nIn other words , the world around us is being created moment by moment , and our expectations of what the world should be is what gives it form .\nIn order to alter its form or to change course , we can use the directed focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something different for ourselves , and in time and through repetition , this reality will eventually take form .\nThe feeling is the key .\nThis is something we do all the time .\nThe best example of this , perhaps , is the human body , which can by some measures be considered a projection of human consciousness .\nWe see this everywhere .\nFor example , just look

health and body , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body .\nThey intentionally feel how they want to feel .\nOn the other hand , a person with an out of shape , obese , or disease-ridden body undoubtedly engages in thought patterns and beliefs about health which support such poor health .\nThey never believe that they can be disease free or of ideal weight , and so their thoughts reinforce habits which

their lives , scrambling to clutch onto the threads of some contrived meaning or purpose .\nReality , a make-believe funfair , is teetering on the edge of an abyss of abstraction .\nAnd this current uncertainty makes us all feel panicky .\nWe never fully realized that we were here to decide upon our reality .\nWe have been sitting back , consuming someone else \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSomewhere along the way , the human species got stripped of its intentionality and its will to purpose .\nThe English writer and philosopher Colin Wilson was correct in spotting this loss of inner vitality .\nHe related it to a rise in a need for security and by people enclosing themselves within their own walls , whether physical or mental .\nWilson remarked that : \u2018 Too much security becomes boredom , and boredom leads to a decline in vitality .\nMan has surrounded himself by walls , and has built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a centre of security ; but the security has begun to stifle him.\n\u2019 [ i ] Whether security or insecurity , certainty and uncertainty , both sides of the coin are being used to form an enclosure around the human being .\nAnd this creates the sense of being stifled .\nThe focus has been upon the minutiae \u2013 the details , the micro \u2013 with a loss of the macro or larger , expanded vision .\nWe are conditioned to live for crumbs rather than feasts .\nThis has given humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waking hours staring into , yet it has shredded the awe and exploration into the larger questions of existence .\nHumankind has , largely speaking , stepped into an existential zone of its own making ; we have voluntarily cut ourselves off from our inherent vital energies and are living off a pocket generator .\nBy living our lives within a thin sliver of consciousness and denying the potential of accessing a wider scope of perceptual awareness , we are existing in a kind of \u2018 sub-threshold \u2019 state .\nIt is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that we are living in a state of forgetfulness .\nAnd this then gets perpetuated by routines and habits that establish a regular everyday overfamiliarity to life , which then leads to increased automation of oneself .\nI am suggesting that life in the existential zone is based on the recognition that ordinary everyday human consciousness is experienced within a highly reduced and limited form .\nFurther , that this restricted human consciousness is accepted by most people and not questioned , even though it results from certain deliberate external conditions such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have learnt not to question the limited state of our conscious awareness .\nAnd it is this that has led humanity into a life of reduced cognition regarding our place within the grander scheme of universal awareness .\nFor most of us , we live our lives as if within a fishbowl .\nOr to use another analogy , the world is like a huge \u2018 dark room , \u2019 and we navigate our steps through crude external stimuli .\nAs Wilson characterized it : \u2018 The countries of the mind may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a visa to stay there.\n\u2019 [ ii ] Yet the thing is , we could get a visa if only we applied for it ourselves .\nThe expansive consciousness field is in permanent existence , only that we do not make any efforts to reach out to it by shifting away from our place of restricted awareness .\nWhy is this so ?\nI doubt if there is any one answer for this but rather a confluence of factors .\nA primary factor is that we are never told that anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter-reality .\nWe have been taught by our \u2018 knowledge institutions \u2019 that consciousness is a by-product of our brain and is only a result of our neuronal connections and it finishes with the death of the body .\nIn other words , we have been conditioned into a belief set that there is \u2018 nothing out there \u2019 beyond what is basically in front of our noses .\nAnd so , we tend to go through life with these adopted blinkers over our perceptive awareness .\nRather than making efforts to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we end up struggling for meaning through material gains .\nAnd when we achieve what we have told ourselves is our aim , we quickly become restless again .\nWe never perceive that there is a threshold of human consciousness .\nWe don \u2019 t need to go out seeking \u2018 mystical experiences \u2019 either , for this is likely to keep us on the merry-go-round of attractions as spiritual tourists .\nLike a roller coaster , we reach a peak , get a high , then it \u2019 s a fast track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere are thrills in this , yet there is no permanence of insight .\nSuch rides and rituals , of which our lives are full of , serve to keep our attention and awareness narrowed , and any aspects lying beyond the narrowing get excluded .\nLife in the existential zone is all about following the noise rather than the signal and excluding all those aspects that do not fall ( or are accepted ) into the mainstream , consensus narrative .\nExclusion then becomes a habit with us , and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are asked \u2013 do you feel authentic ?\n\u2013 then how is a person to respond ?\nDo we have any sense of discernment to know , truly know , when we are authentic or not ?\nAnd if so , then how are we inauthentic ?\nWhy is it that we ask so few questions about the fundamentals of our own existence ?\nIt would seem that there is a form of forgetfulness that hangs over us in this realm , as if we are being compelled to remain as dreamers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme that runs through many ancient traditions and teachings .\nIn his theory of anamnesis , Plato says humanity possesses knowledge of its past , only that we have forgotten this knowledge and so we need to rediscover the knowledge within us .\nPlato wrote that humanity could only know the \u2018 real world \u2019 in the form of memories .\nThat is , human thought was really a form of recollection , and that humankind generally existed within a state of collective amnesia , having only fragments of recollection as reference points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity had lost \u2013 or fallen from \u2013 an earlier state of heightened awareness and now had only traces of this memory in their collective psyche as a reminder .\nIn ancient Greek , truth is called aletheia which means not forgetting ; and in Greek mythology , before the human soul incarnates into this world it drinks from Lethe , the river of Forgetfulness and one of the five rivers of the underworld , so that it can not remember its origins .\nSimilarly , there is a Jewish legend that speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth by an angel before birth so that we can not speak of our pre-birth knowledge .\nSuch myths and tales as these are suggesting to us that we need to learn how to remember \u2013 that knowledge beyond our normal ken is re-collection as much as it is cognition .\nWe arrive in this earthly realm with an inheritance , only that we lack the key to unlock those restrictions placed upon us so that we can access expanded awareness and knowledge .\nWe need to find the Ariadne thread within this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labyrinth or perceptual maze that we find ourselves in .\nOur lives are attempts at entering once again into a lost remembrance which lies so far and yet so close to us .\nThe 13th century Persian poet Jal\u0101l ad-D\u012bn R\u016bm\u012b wrote that \u2018 The Truth is closer to us than our own jugular vein.\n\u2019 And yet , so vain do we search , as if we have fallen away from true remembrance .\nIf we make no efforts , then we shall remain in ignorance to our existence .\nWe shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around a chessboard , unknowing of the hands that move us .\nThe sense of human life will be measured by the few material gains and pleasures we have obtained before the exit door approaches .\nWe shall leave this arena having no true gains .\nHaving failed to learn of why we came , we may end up exiting through a revolving door only to be thrown back into the game again .\nWe have been programmed with the nice little adage that \u2018 Ignorance is Bliss , \u2019 and then offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed upon .\nYet a world that exists in ignorance shall never find its true way forward .\nIt will stumble and fall and flail about blindly .\nIt is time for us to see the condition of life ; to understand how the consensus narrative is generated and manipulated ; how people are kept in ignorance of their true origins and capacities ; and finally , how to activate those organs that will allow us to receive a greater portion of consciousness .\nAnd with that greater conscious awareness , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to take the helm of our lives .\nKingsley L.
