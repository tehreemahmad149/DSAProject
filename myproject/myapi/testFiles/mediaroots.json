conversation .\nThank you so much for joining us with this very , very important conversation that we \u2019 re about to have .\nBrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BB : Sure .\nSo , of course , Abby , the world is in a state of shock in many ways because\u2014even those who have been watching the events very , very closely for the past three or four months as this crisis has evolved\u2014I don \u2019 t think anyone anticipated that the Russian government would launch a full-scale military intervention\u2014not simply in the eastern part of Ukraine , in the Donbass , or in the two independent people \u2019 s republics that Russia earlier recognized this week after eight years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u2019 s from the north , the south , and the east .\nIn other words , almost all but one side , not the western side of Ukraine , but the rest has been the subject of a very large-scale and obviously long-planned Russian military intervention .\nI think that it \u2019 s important for our audience , especially those in the United States\u2014who are getting almost all of their news from CNN , or The New York Times , or The Washington Post , meaning the capitalist-owned media , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so functions as an echo chamber for US government policy\u2014but also in Western Europe , who are largely subjected to the same sort of media infrastructure , to have an independent political understanding of what this crisis is about , what caused it , what \u2019 s happening right now , and what the likely or possible outcomes are in the coming days and weeks and months .\nI do believe that we are witnessing , and have witnessed this week , an event that will change global politics .\nThis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Soviet Union collapsed , or was dissolved , in 1991 .\nAt the end of 1991 , that was 30-plus years ago , the Soviet Union was obviously the second major power in the world .\nIt was the leader of the socialist camp : the countries of Eastern and Central Europe , not to mention the socialist governments in Asia and in Cuba .\nAll of them understood that there was a global socialist camp that was in conflict with the Western , US-led imperialist camp .\nAnd , while there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the socialist camp around the time its normalization of relations began with the United States following Richard Nixon \u2019 s trip to Shanghai , that was 50 years ago , the Shanghai Communique , literally signed two or three days from now\u2014there was a certain equilibrium between the two camps as a consequence of the Soviets achieving military parity , or near parity\u2014and certainly parity on the nuclear front .\nThere was , at a certain point , an understanding that , should there be a war between the two camps in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured destruction , that no one could really win a nuclear war .\nIf each side has thousands of nuclear weapons and they \u2019 re on airplanes and they \u2019 re in submarines and they \u2019 re in land-based missile silos , in that nuclear exchange there would be the end of humanity and life on the planet as we know it .\nThis equilibrium of terror between the two sides , mutually assured destruction , in a way functioned as a deterrent to major power conflict .\nThat doesn \u2019 t mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were wars all over the place .\nThere was the Vietnam War , the Korean War .\nYou could go on and on , but there wasn \u2019 t sort of a repeat of World War II or World War I\u2014where , in the case of World War II , a hundred million human beings were killed in a matter of five or six years , and the whole existing world order was basically shattered and left in ruins by 1945 .\nThere wasn \u2019 t that kind of a conflict , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elapsed since the collapse or the dissolution or the overthrow of the Soviet Union , and thus the socialist camp , US policy has dramatically shifted .\nInstead of recognizing the limitations of American power vis-a-vis the two powers facing each other in this equilibrium , the United States policymakers , starting in 1991 , established what eventually became the neocon consensus position : that the United States would be able to exercise unipolar authority over the rest of the world , that it would destroy all of the governments whose origin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-World War II era .\nThe countries that had looked at the socialist camp\u2014even if they weren \u2019 t part of it , they looked to it for military , economic , and diplomatic support , and I \u2019 m thinking there of Iraq and Libya and Syria and several others\u2014those countries would be targeted for attack .\nIn fact , we witnessed that .\nWe witnessed this giant acceleration , after the end of the Soviet era , of American imperial aggressiveness .\nBut there was sort of an understanding in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s side , that Boris Yeltsin\u2014who had helped overthrow the Soviet Union , who actually dissolved the Soviet Union illegally in December 1991 in an accord signed with two or three other republic leaders of the Soviet Union , there were fifteen republics in the Soviet Union\u2014was the anti-communist friend of the West .\nAnd Russia itself had become completely weakened as a consequence of the overthrow of the Soviet Union .\nSoviet life expectancy , or Russian life expectancy , decreased six years in six years , between 1991 and 1997 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectancy is unheard of\u2014except during wartime , but this was peacetime .\nThe looting of Soviet public property , the impoverishment of its people , the destruction of what had been the Soviet social and economic infrastructure , as a consequence of the capitalist takeover of Russia and the other former Soviet republics , plunged Russia and its people into dire poverty and into suffering .\nAnd it also weakened Russia as a geostrategic player .\nThe United States was , in a way , content with that situation .\nThere was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States in 1997 about NATO , about NATO-Russian relations .\nThere had been , before then , the promise by James Baker\u2014who was Secretary of State under the administration of George H.W .\nBush\u2014that NATO wouldn \u2019 t move one inch eastward .\nWe \u2019 ve heard all of that .\nThose were the promises given .\nBut there are a couple of things , Abby , that I think we have to really pay attention to in terms of why we are where we are right now .\nAM : Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 re completely right .\nI want to get more into where we went with Russia from the collapse of the Soviet Union till today and how that \u2019 s manifested , because you mentioned something really important .\nThis Cold War-era architecture that was put into place after the dissolution of the Soviet Union that was trying to prevent this mutually assured destruction attitude that dominated generations prior , all of these things were disbanded .\nAll these things were rejected .\nThe entire framework basically fell apart\u2014all of these diplomatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are right now\u2014was rejected .\nLet \u2019 s get into NATO because , of course , this is the main facet , right ?\nThis is the underpinning of the failed negotiations that were attempted before this invasion took place .\nJanuary : Russia met with 30 NATO states in a series of talks to try to deliberate .\nAnd Russia \u2019 s base concern , among several other concerns , was Ukraine should never join NATO\u2014that no progress on all these other concerns could be made as long as this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no resolution .\nRussia had a negotiator at the table that basically said , \u201c We are going to militarily react if this is not diplomatically negotiated.\n\u201d It became untenable .\nEveryone just thought that they were bluffing , right ?\nI think many officials in the West , who have been predicting this for months and months across corporate media , still thought it was an empty threat .\nPerhaps they thought they could troll Russia into backing down , maybe , if they did think that Russia was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that a lot of them didn \u2019 t think Russia would invade\u2014and this includes a lot of Russian experts , Ukrainian officials , even the Defense Minister of Ukraine was saying this was not going to happen .\nNow you see them following up , a lot of these war hawks from the think tank establishment , saying Putin \u2019 s insane , he \u2019 s crazy for doing this , even though these same people were saying he \u2019 s about to do this for the last six months .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying about literally everything to get us into war , I think , made people have this knee-jerk reaction that no , of course this isn \u2019 t going to happen .\nBut here we are , Brian .\nLet \u2019 s take a look at the security concerns\u2014namely NATO , the existence of NATO going up to Russia \u2019 s doorstep\u2014that led us to this failure of diplomacy .\nGive us a sense of what NATO is as a force .\nWhy does it exist in the first place ?\nWhat has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union ?\nAnd are Russia \u2019 s fears of NATO legitimate ?\nBB : Yeah , that \u2019 s the most important thing , because I believe , Abby , that if the US and the other NATO countries , who are basically under the US influence , had taken a different step , had actually said yes to Russia in the last four months on what we have to agree are legitimate Russian security concerns , this would not be happening right now in Ukraine .\nYou are right .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s why we are here .\nIf you look at life from the history of heroes and villains , right now we know Putin is the villain , and all the Western powers , of course , are the good guys .\nBut that deprives those who have that view of actually understanding the historical context , which is everything .\nSo let \u2019 s\u2014and , as a Marxist , I discard the history of great men , or the great heroes and villains , as the way to understand history\u2014look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict with each other that also have a class basis .\nWhat is NATO ?\nNATO was formed in 1949 , at the Pentagon .\nIt was a consummation of a military alliance of the United States and Britain and France and a few other European countries\u2014did not include Germany at that time .\nIt was too soon after World War II to include a re-militarized , formerly Nazi Germany that had started World War II into a NATO alliance .\nBut eventually that did happen\u2014and that happened in 1955 .\nIt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the bringing Germany into NATO just 10 years after the German invasion of the Soviet Union had been finally brought to a halt .\nThat invasion , as we know , took 27 million lives of Soviet citizens , not to mention the genocide against Jews and Roma people , gay people .\nThe genocide perpetrated by fascism was brought to an end by the Soviet Union , and its amazing heroism and counter-offensive , but at great cost : 27 million dead .\nThe Americans only lost 400,000\u2014not only , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in World War II .\nBut compare it to 27 million dead .\nSo NATO was formed in 1949 .\nThen , Germany is brought into NATO\u2014and , by West Germany , we mean a lot of nazified Germany , by the way , in terms of the establishment .\nWhen the Soviet Union collapses , their version of NATO , the Warsaw Pact\u2014the mirror , the symmetry of a second military alliance representing the socialist camp\u2014is also extinguished .\nInstead of NATO disappearing , it takes on a different role .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exist .\nWhy spend all of this money ?\nWhy , as Obama demanded and Trump insisted , should the European countries who are members of NATO guarantee that they \u2019 ll spend at least two percent of their national budget for death and destruction\u2014otherwise they won \u2019 t be NATO members in good standing ?\nIt \u2019 s a permanent military alliance , and where does NATO go ?\nIt invades Afghanistan .\nWell that \u2019 s not part of the North Atlantic .\nIt bombs Libya , also not part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1999 , it carried out a savage war , which apparently all the Western media has forgotten about .\nThey keep describing what \u2019 s going on in Ukraine as the biggest war since the end of World War II in Europe .\nWell , NATO dropped 28,000 bombs and missiles on Yugoslavia .\nAgain , similarly to what Russia is demanding about Eastern Ukraine , where the Russians are saying , \u201c There \u2019 s an abused minority people in the eastern part of Ukraine who are Russian-speaking and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d the United States was using the Albanian Muslim population in Kosovo , a province of Serbia , as the pretext to go to war against Yugoslavia .\nSo , here you have war in Yugoslavia , war in Afghanistan , war against Libya .\nThat \u2019 s NATO after the collapse of the Soviet Union .\nThe thing that most alarmed Russia after the year 2000 , I would say : in 1999 , there was a wave of NATO expansion , and some of the former Russian allies and Soviet republics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latvia , Estonia , Lithuania .\nAnd then , in 2004 , another wave of NATO expansion .\nBut in 2008 , NATO had a summit in Bucharest .\nAnd at that summit , the United States insisted\u2014and , this is extremely important , France and Germany dissented from the American position\u2014that the US was going to bring Ukraine and Georgia , two important former Soviet republics and principal allies of Russia , into NATO .\nThe Russians , at that point , who had tolerated the first and second wave of NATO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c No , we \u2019 re not going to allow either Georgia or Ukraine to come into NATO because that presents an existential threat .\nAnd remember that Bucharest summit was April 2008 .\nThe Russians moved into Georgia in August 2008 .\nRemember there was a battle in South Ossetia .\nThat \u2019 s when the Russians moved in .\nIt was quite clear that , for Russia , this was a red line .\nThey were not going to let Georgia come into NATO .\nNow , everything between 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing really happened .\nBut in 2014 , of course , Abby , as you know , and we can talk about , the Maidan coup d \u2019 etat that destroyed a government , the Yanukovych government , corrupt but democratically elected government , that was basically saying : \u201c We \u2019 re between East and West .\nLet \u2019 s be neutral .\nWe are neutral .\nWe want to have good relations with the EU but we want to have good relations with Russia .\nWe don \u2019 t want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want NATO membership.\n\u201d That government was overthrown by a Nazi-led\u2014and I mean it , literally Nazi and neo-Nazi-led\u2014coup d \u2019 etat , which John McCain and Victoria Nuland , Republicans and Democrats , saluted as a great day for Ukrainian democracy .\nThat \u2019 s when everything shifts , because , from then on , Russia knows that Ukraine will be , eventually , admitted into NATO .\nAM : Yeah .\nIt became a fertile ground , then , for the beginning of the end , which was exactly the intent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Nazi-led coup .\nI wanted to point out a couple things to corroborate your point .\nJust the fact that the NATO-Russia Founding Act on Mutual Relations\u2014back during the Clinton administration , signed in 1997\u2014basically promised that NATO would not expand into Eastern Europe , not an inch .\nThere was a classified memo\u2014released months prior to the invasion of Georgia , sent directly to high-profile US officials , the Secretary of Defense , Secretary of State\u2014a Wikileak cable that was released saying that this is going to cause an unpredictable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia \u2019 s national security interests .\nThis was years before what happened in 2014 .\nAnd , as you mentioned , the US was not always hostile with Russia .\nLet \u2019 s go back to this decade of time and how it transpired over the course of the War on Terror .\nYou mentioned the US meddling in the Yeltsin elections , propping up Yeltsin , the looting of the post-Soviet economy , just the dire state of affairs for Russian people , the hardships that they faced throughout the \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their own version of the War on Terror , using the Chechnyans to basically reach out to George W. Bush after 9/11 , saying , \u201c We will help you invade Afghanistan , \u201d ironically\u2014given their history with Afghanistan .\nBut then you fast forward to the Iraq War , where Putin said , \u201c Look , we \u2019 re not going to support this , this makes no sense , \u201d which , of course , increased the tenuous nature of the relationship .\nAs you mentioned , 2014 was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances that led Russia to step in to counter this extremely dire situation .\nI mean , Obama really was being pushed from all sides , the red line , to put that no-fly zone in Syria , and Putin basically said , \u201c You know , we \u2019 re going to step in here.\n\u201d Can you just explain that context really briefly before we get to the coup ?\nBB : Yeah , that \u2019 s really important , and , again , I \u2019 m glad you mentioned and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States didn \u2019 t always look unfavorably at the Russian government after the dissolution of the Soviet Union .\nRemember George W. Bush .\nHe said that he looked into Putin \u2019 s eyes and he could see his soul .\nI \u2019 m paraphrasing , but remember that ?\nIt sounded like he was kind of interested in Putin .\nLike , really .\nHe liked Putin .\nHe was his bud .\nThey \u2019 re best friends forever .\nHe had this connection to him .\nAnd then relations deteriorated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bucharest summit , where NATO said , \u201c We \u2019 re going to move Georgia into NATO , \u201d which , of course , means moving nuclear weapons on Russia \u2019 s border .\nOr potentially doing that .\nSo then relations deteriorated .\nAnd then Obama wins the election .\nAnd the first thing Obama does is he has his Secretary of State , none other than Hillary Clinton , go and meet with Sergey Lavrov .\nRemember ?\nThey brought that great big red button .\nAM : Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wile E. Coyote .\nBB : They said , \u201c Let \u2019 s press the big red reset button.\n\u201d By the way , Lavrov was confused because the State Department is so incompetent that they didn \u2019 t get the Russian translation for reset properly .\nHe was looking at the thing , what does this mean ?\nI can \u2019 t remember what the term was .\nBut anyway , it wasn \u2019 t reset .\nThe point was Obama was trying to improve relations .\nRemember when Obama was caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking ?\nI think it was to Medvedev .\nAt one point , he says , \u201c Well look , just wait till we get through the next American election\u2014and then we can improve relations again with Russia.\n\u201d That was obviously before the 2012 election .\nSo , Obama and Hillary Clinton , at the beginning of the first term of the Obama administration , again looking to Russia .\nRussia is also included in the G7 .\nThe G7 becomes the G8 .\nIt \u2019 s like the imperialist countries have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this little junior partner come in : Russia .\nChina \u2019 s not included , even though the Chinese economy was taking off at that point .\nRussia , as a , quote , \u201c European power , \u201d was brought in as well to the G7 .\nThe G7 becomes the G8 .\nIt looks like maybe things are getting sort of normal between the US and Russia .\nRussia \u2019 s attitude , as you mentioned , they didn \u2019 t like the war in Iraq .\nPutin didn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they didn \u2019 t do that much to oppose it .\nWhen it came to Libya , in 2011 , both Russia and China abstained , instead of using their veto , when the US pushed through Resolution 1973\u2014meaning that the UN was authorizing the use of force to protect Libyan civilians in the eastern part of Libya in Benghazi .\nOf course , that became the fig leaf and the pretext for Britain , France and the United States using NATO to destroy Libya .\nSo , we had all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia , and also by China .\nAnd the US was considering Russia to be sort of a partner of sorts .\nEverything changes , as you mentioned , then , Abby , in 2013 and 2014 .\nSo , what happens ?\nAnd this is so important .\nInstead of just thinking of Putin as the evil one and America , or the West , as the good guys , let \u2019 s think about what actually happened .\nThe US destroys Libya in the war in 2011 .\nThe head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets , 70-year-old man is lynched in the streets .\nHillary Clinton is caught on tape , or wants to be on tape , laughing , saying : \u201c Hahaha .\nWe came .\nWe saw .\nHe died.\n\u201d Then\u2014she and the hawks in the State Department , including Blinken and Jake Sullivan , the whole current crew\u2014they \u2019 re like , \u201c On to Syria !\n\u201d Now Syria is next .\nObama and Clinton and John Kerry , who later becomes Secretary of State after Clinton , are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We \u2019 re gon na do to Syria what we just did to Libya.\n\u201d Syria is a longtime ally , first of the Soviet Union , and , after the Soviet Union , of Russia .\nIt \u2019 s a principal alliance .\nAnd after looking at what the United States did with its UN authorization in Libya , which was to destroy the government , the Putin government decided to put its foot down and decided they weren \u2019 t going to let the neocons in the US government destroy Syria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Iraq .\nBy the way , in the last week , Putin is referring back to these as very important decisive moments in this evolution of the relationship\u2014and the evolution of his own thinking .\nThat \u2019 s the real turning point .\nRussia enters the Syrian War and says : \u201c We will not allow Assad \u2019 s government to be destroyed .\nYes , we want to defeat ISIS , but you \u2019 re not going to take over Syria as you did Libya and Iraq.\n\u201d And they win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hezbollah and Iranian-supported militia forces\u2014turned the tide , along , of course , with the Syrian Arab Army , which , even though it was majority Sunni , stuck with the Assad government .\nThey turned the tide .\nThey defeat the right-wing terrorists , who are the allies of the United States and Saudi Arabia and Turkey .\nThat \u2019 s a decisive moment , and that \u2019 s the year before what happens in Maidan .\nAM : Exactly .\nAnd the next year was the coup , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led by far-right forces .\nAs you mentioned , literal neo-Nazi brigades , regiments , that led a violent uprising .\nThey were completely glorified by the Western media .\nApparently , these Western media outlets did not learn , even VICE News\u2014that was infamous for standing in front of these SS symbols on these tanks behind them .\nFast-forward to the coverage today and they are still glorifying the Azov Battalion and far-right , ultra-nationalist groups .\nIt is just startling that these outlets just don \u2019 t care or haven \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really can \u2019 t explain that away .\nBut the coup was , of course , a really formative moment in the dissolving of the relations between Russia and the US\u2014because you had officials like Victoria Nuland out there talking openly about how we have invested $ 5 billion dollars in \u201c Ukrainian democracy , \u201d quote-unquote , over the last decade or so .\nWe all know what that \u2019 s code for .\nThat \u2019 s code for fomenting regime change through organizations\u2014like the NED , USAID\u2014in countries that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their governments .\nYou had her , John McCain on the ground meeting with these far-right insurgencies , doing photo ops .\nIt was quite over-the-top .\nSo , it is not hyperbolic to say that this was a US-backed operation\u2014this coup happened .\nIt was very intent to try to throw a wrench in the relations between Ukraine and Russia .\nYou mentioned abandoning that IMF loan in favor of the Russia loan .\nThere was a lot that was going into that .\nAt the time , of course , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annexation of Crimea , all of the heat on Russia Today\u2014basically blaming Russia Today as being part and parcel of this operation of Russia meddling in US democracy .\nIt was really the beginning of a whole new wave of Russia-phobia , of this narrative that became front and center : that Putin was this archvillain controlling aspects of US society , really projecting and deflecting away from what the US had been doing for so long .\nBrian , of course , I was in the middle of it being at Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surreal experience .\nOne of the questions in the chat that I wanted to throw at you to guide us into this current situation .\nSeveral high-ranking ultra-nationalists rose to prominence after the coup , especially in the armed forces .\nI don \u2019 t know where that went after that .\nA person in the chat is asking : How influential are the Nazi forces ?\nBecause this is a big talking point that we \u2019 re seeing used by Putin .\nWe can get into his speech and all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point that \u2019 s being peddled out there and repeated is that this is about the denazification of Ukraine .\nAnd it is a valid point that Nazis were prominent in the coup and after the coup , but , since then , we have seen another election .\nZelensky took power in a democratic election since then\u2014and he \u2019 s a Jewish man , and there are a lot of Jewish citizens living in Ukraine .\nIt does seem like there is no nuance given .\nThere \u2019 s kind of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazi regime \u201d and \u201c Well , we just got to go take out this Nazi regime.\n\u201d Comment on that before we get into the fighting in these other regions and , of course , the invasion itself .\nBB : I think it might be useful , Abby , you can decide to spend a little bit more time on how Maidan actually unfolded and why it unfolded .\nBB : And then we could talk about the role of the fascist wing\u2014because it wasn \u2019 t the only wing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing in the protest going on in the center of Kiev .\nWe can talk about them because\u2014as you rightly mentioned , as people are putting in the chat\u2014Putin is now explaining the Russian invasion of Ukraine , or the Russian military intervention there , on the basis that it \u2019 s going to demilitarize Ukraine and it \u2019 s going to denazify Ukraine .\nThese are two of the main points that are used by Putin to explain or to justify the Russian military action .\nBut I want to go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it is important for people to understand and not have a cartoonish understanding of Ukraine or Ukrainian politics .\nOf course , Nazism and fascism played an important role in Ukraine during World War II , where a section of Ukrainian society fought with the Nazis .\nThose people , who are part of the far right today , are putting up the banners of the fascist leaders of that time\u2014as if they are the national heroes , they are the George Washingtons of their country .\nThat \u2019 s important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protests start in Maidan .\nMaidan is the center square in Kiev .\nThe European Union , not the United States , said to Yanukovych\u2014who was this neutral government in Kiev , again , as I said , balancing between East and West , said that he wouldn \u2019 t join NATO .\nThey said to Yanukovych : \u201c If you \u2019 re going to enter the EU , then you \u2019 ve got to do it right now .\nAnd we \u2019 re not going to bring you in as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what \u2019 s called an EU association agreement.\n\u201d Which meant basically that Ukraine would enter the EU , but under conditions of extreme economic austerity , like what was imposed on the people of Greece\u2014but even worse .\nYanukovych said no to that agreement .\nHe didn \u2019 t say , \u201c No , I don \u2019 t want to be in the EU.\n\u201d He said : \u201c This agreement is a bad agreement for Ukrainians .\nWe \u2019 re already poor .\nThis will make us poorer.\n\u201d At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November and December of 2013 .\nNow , at that time , Putin and the Russians were preoccupied with the Sochi Olympics because they were worried there were going to be protests at the Sochi Olympics .\nThey were worried whether there \u2019 s going to be disruption .\nThere was a lot of struggle .\nThey were distracted by the Olympics while the West started to pour in huge amounts of support for these protests against Yanukovych , seeing it as a geostrategic opportunity .\nThe people who were coming to Maidan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly people who wanted to be part of Europe .\nAnd Europe was giving this ultimatum to Yanukovych : \u201c It \u2019 s either now or never .\nYou accept this agreement , this austerity plan , or you \u2019 re never coming in .\nThen you \u2019 re going to be with Russia.\n\u201d A lot of West Ukrainian people\u2014who look to Europe , who consider themselves Eurocentric compared to being Russocentric\u2014didn \u2019 t want the Yanukovych government to blow the opportunity .\nThen there were hard-right elements who were also in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Azov Brigade , like the other fascist parties .\nDuring the whole time , you can see the EU , and then eventually the United States .\nYou mentioned Victoria Nuland , who had been Hillary Clinton \u2019 s personal press secretary when she became Secretary of State , and she \u2019 s married to a leading neocon , the leader of the neocon movement .\nBB : Robert Kagan .\nAnd she then kind of takes over .\nAt that point , she \u2019 s Assistant Secretary of State under Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She \u2019 s in the square with the protesters .\nNow , this is a big deal for the protesters because now they feel the full backing of the US government .\nShe \u2019 s actually handing out cookies to them .\nOn our podcast , the Socialist Program , which is also available on Breakthrough News , we played the tape of Victoria Nuland talking to other members of the US diplomatic entourage in Kiev right before the coup .\nAnd they \u2019 re talking about who the next leaders of Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u201c Well , what about this guy who \u2019 s in the far right ?\nAnd what about this guy ?\n\u201d She said , \u201c No , no.\n\u201d Then , the US ambassador says , \u201c Well , the EU thinks it should be this.\n\u201d And she says , and pardon my language : \u201c Fuck the EU !\nIt \u2019 s going to be Yats .\nIt \u2019 s going to be Yats .\nYats is going to be the guy.\n\u201d Now , Yats is Yatsenyuk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financier guy .\nThey wanted him to be the new leader of Ukraine because he could connect more with the United States\u2014and he wasn \u2019 t tarnished by Nazism .\nSo , the coup happens .\nBy the way , on February 21st , an agreement is signed .\nGermany \u2019 s there .\nI think Poland \u2019 s there .\nRussia \u2019 s there .\nThe United States is there .\nThe opposition , including the mainstream opposition and the fascists and Yanukovych , they \u2019 re all there .\nThey sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agreement is basically , \u201c We agree to all the protesters \u2019 demands , we \u2019 re going to have early elections , \u201d meaning Yanukovych will probably lose and somebody who \u2019 s even more pro-EU will win .\nThere \u2019 s going to be a devolution of political authority away from the center into the regions\u2014that \u2019 s helpful because Ukraine is a demographically divided country .\nYanukovych says yes and agrees to pull the cops out of Maidan .\nThat \u2019 s the agreement .\nThe next day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm the parliament , disperse it .\nThe president flees for his life .\nVictoria Nuland , John McCain say : \u201c This is a great day for Ukraine !\nThis is the greatest day for Ukraine !\n\u201d This Nazi-led coup d \u2019 etat .\nThink about January 6th .\nThis was January 6th on steroids , because it actually dispersed the parliament and seized the power .\nAnd then , a government that was a transitional government under these far-right fascist forces says , \u201c Look , Russia is now banned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it clear that they \u2019 re a Russophobe , hostile regime .\nThey say , \u201c We \u2019 re going to come into NATO.\n\u201d That \u2019 s when the battle in the eastern part of Ukraine\u2014what is Donetsk and Luhansk , and also Crimea\u2014heats up .\nBecause it \u2019 s at that moment that the people in the East realize that this government is going to be with NATO and it \u2019 s going to be anti-Russia and anti-Russian .\nAn armed struggle starts in the East .\nAnd that \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval base that Russia has in Crimea , which is their biggest base , is not going to be a NATO base with nuclear weapons against Russia .\nThat \u2019 s when Putin says , \u201c I \u2019 m permitting the referendum , \u201d which , of course , is stage managed by the Russian military to have a referendum in Crimea\u2014but most of the people in Crimea want to be with Russia .\nThey \u2019 re mostly Russian-oriented or Russian people or Russian-speaking .\nAnd so they vote overwhelmingly in the referendum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the invasion by Russia .\nSo , would that have happened , would Crimea have happened , if it hadn \u2019 t been for the coup ?\nWould the coup have happened if it wasn \u2019 t for the fascists using their muscle ?\nWould the coup have happened if the different international signatories had agreed to the February 21st compromise ?\nNone of this would have happened .\nI say , to the American peace movement and to the American people , if you \u2019 re upset and angry about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , you should say that this is the fault of Victoria Nuland and John McCain and the Republican Party and the Democratic Party and the State Department .\nThe only thing that was different between then and now is President Barack Obama was a restraining force on the neocon forces within the US government .\nUnlike what came later under Trump and Biden , Obama absolutely refused to send weapons to Ukraine after the coup because he knew that Russia would perceive that to be the beginning of the end for Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was creating a de facto membership for Ukraine even if it wasn \u2019 t formally a member .\nThat \u2019 s kind of an important part of this context .\nAM : Right , and let \u2019 s explain more thoroughly this fighting that \u2019 s been ongoing since the coup .\nThe toppling of the government didn \u2019 t mark the end of the violence .\nThe fighting continued until the invasion .\nSo , for people who are living in these disputed regions\u2014which was Donetsk and Luhansk , that Donbass is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shocked to learn that 14,000 people had died since the coup in these regions , that the Ukrainian military has been taking pretty severe action fighting the Russian-backed separatists .\nFar-right nationalists fighting Russian-backed separatists in these regions .\nGetting arms funneled to them by Russia and , of course , by the US .\nThe US government has been\u2014openly , as well as covertly .\nI just saw a clip from Adam Schiff basically bragging about how we \u2019 ve used Ukraine to \u201c fight Russia over there , so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , \u201d bragging about the fact that we are using Ukraine for a proxy war to literally fight Russia and funneling millions of dollars in lethal weaponry that , of course , was crossing another red line .\nThen you see Biden , because of the amassing of Russian troops in this region , taking that other dramatic stance\u2014where he sent more weapons , the , quote-unquote , \u201c lethal aid \u201d that was parroted uncritically from the media , anti-tank weapons , all of these things protested vehemently by Moscow .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ escalated the already fraught tensions , how it broke down the negotiations .\nBut first , can you speak to the Nazi presence today in terms of their control in the government and armed forces ?\nBB : Well , the Ukrainian state is fundamentally a very weak entity and , in many ways , the right-wing paramilitaries have either been incorporated into the Ukrainian state\u2014by right-wing I mean the fascists or neo-fascists .\nSome of them have said , \u201c We no longer need to be revolutionaries , \u201d as they put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the state , \u201d and , in fact , have been incorporated into the Ukrainian military and into Ukrainian police forces .\nSo that \u2019 s real .\nThat \u2019 s absolutely real .\nThe political position of the fascist forces has weakened in the last couple years , however .\nUkraine , in the main , is not Nazi .\nIt \u2019 s not a pro-Nazi country .\nIt \u2019 s not a pro-fascist country .\nIn the 2019 parliamentary elections , the political forces who formed the united right bloc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got about 2.1 percent of the vote , 2.1 percent of the parliamentary vote\u2014which doesn \u2019 t mean that they can \u2019 t be impactful , and , certainly for the people in the eastern part of Ukraine , where they have launched this Russophobe war .\nThere \u2019 s been a lot of casualties .\nAnd some of the fascist units have functioned as rogue units .\nEven if the Ukrainian military isn \u2019 t shelling , they don \u2019 t have complete discipline over all of these militia units .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ own fight .\nOf course , for them , they want the war with Russia .\nThey wanted the war with Russia .\nThey wanted it\u2014because if there was a war with Russia , the West will take their side , and if they take their side , that means they accelerate into positions of power .\nNow , they also know that , even though it fought Nazi Germany and against Mussolini \u2019 s Italy in World War II , the United States government policy isn \u2019 t historically an anti-fascist policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The US will work with any force , including the most right-wing fascist forces .\nWe see this throughout Latin America .\nThe School of the Americas at Fort Benning\u2014named after the Confederate general , for General Benning\u2014trained the fascists in Latin America .\nThey killed the left .\nThey killed the workers and the peasants and the communists and the socialists and the people who just wanted Latin America to be independent .\nThe fascists know the US is willing to play ball with fascism as long as they do America \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s been very useful to keep the conflict in the eastern part of Ukraine going because it provides a position of endless militarization\u2014and then Ukraine is importing more and more weapons into Ukraine , which are being directed largely against Russian-speaking people , or Russian people , who live in the eastern part of Ukraine .\nBut , from the point of view of the Russian government , all of those weapons coming into Ukraine , as it becomes a de facto member\u2014not a formal member , but a de facto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never be taken out .\nAnd , we \u2019 ll talk about this more , too , but , in the recent months , Turkey has sent advanced drones .\nTurkey\u2014of course , is the eastern flank of NATO\u2014has sent advanced drones to the Ukrainian government .\nThat wouldn \u2019 t have happened without the US giving the green light to it .\nAnd those drones\u2014drone weapons are very sophisticated technologies now\u2014they \u2019 re hitting their Russian targets , either people in the East or even Russian targets inside of Russia .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocking to the Putin administration how all of these advanced weapons are coming in .\nWell , you know , it also happens that it comes two years , three years after the US army , under Trump , arbitrarily canceled the INF Treaty .\nThere are two big treaties\u2014this is a bit of a digression , but I think might as well mention them for people since we \u2019 re going down all of these historical routes .\nThe US canceled the ABM Treaty , the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty , in 2002 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , \u201c This will be a game changer.\n\u201d But then , in 2019 , the US canceled the treaty signed by Gorbachev and Reagan in 1986 , called the INF Treaty , the Intermediate Nuclear Range Treaty .\nThat treaty barred the United States or Russia of putting intermediate-range nuclear missiles\u2014that had a flight of three to six hundred miles and could reach their target in under ten minutes\u2014in any of the areas close to each other \u2019 s territory .\nThat \u2019 s what was happening in the 1980s .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement in Europe , the freeze movement .\nThe US had put all these short-range missiles that could hit Soviet targets in six minutes all over Europe .\nAnd the Europeans went into the streets and said , \u201c Look , you \u2019 re going to use our country as a staging ground for a nuclear war against the Soviets but you \u2019 re not going to die in Chicago , you \u2019 re not going to die in Washington .\nWe \u2019 re going to die.\n\u201d And that \u2019 s why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets and built this independent anti-war movement that said \u201c No !\n\u201d And Gorbachev and Reagan signed that treaty in 1986 , and that was a principal part of that architecture that we talked about in the beginning , that Cold War architecture , that created equilibrium .\nThe US , under Trump , canceled it , and that meant that Russians are looking at that and they \u2019 re saying : \u201c Okay , they \u2019 re going to place those weapons at the Ukrainian border with Russia , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will reach their targets in less than 10 minutes .\nWe can \u2019 t defend against them .\nAnd that means we \u2019 ll never have a day of peace .\nWe \u2019 ll always be under a threat that we can \u2019 t really refute or rebut or push back against.\n\u201d These are the red lines that Putin has been talking about .\nBut , again , if you look at Maidan as the turning point\u2014because it means that Ukraine , which had been neutral up until 2014 , is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facto part of NATO\u2014and then the Ukrainian government launches this endless war against the people in the East .\nAnd , by the way , Russia also contributed to that war .\nI think this is important .\nI think that as long as that war continued , in a formal sense , as long as there was a territorial dispute in the eastern part of the country , NATO formal membership would be prohibited .\nNATO rules insist that any country that has a border dispute on its territory can \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as there was a conflict in the East , that meant , in a formal way , Ukraine could not enter NATO .\nAlso , it meant that the Russian government had its own ability to have some influence inside of the struggle inside of Ukraine\u2014and also there was pressure from Russian people in Russia .\nThey were like : \u201c These are the people in the Donbass .\nUntil 1922 or 1924 , when the Soviet Union was created , the Donbass was Russian .\nI mean , other parts of Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Russian people and why are you letting Ukrainian Nazis\u2014who killed so many of us and who we spent so many millions of lives to defeat these Nazis\u2014shell our brethren in Donbass ?\n\u201d I think Putin was under extreme pressure to not abandon the Russian-speaking population in the eastern part of Ukraine .\nThere \u2019 s this element of Nazism and the struggle against Russian-speaking people .\nIt \u2019 s complex .\nIt \u2019 s got a number of different factors , but certainly the public pressure on Putin to do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of Ukraine can \u2019 t be discounted .\nAM : And , of course , all of this led to the negotiations completely failing .\nIt all brought us to what happened just days ago , Brian , where Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine , sending hundreds , if not thousands , of troops in , launching hundreds of missile attacks on cities across the country .\nI have to say , just personally as an anti-war activist , I care about war everywhere\u2014my government has been bombing countless countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of people across the planet for decades .\nI think that this is a criminal act , what Putin has done , and I do have moral problems with it .\nI think war is horrific , and civilians needlessly die and suffer every time war is carried out .\nIt kills soldiers on both sides that don \u2019 t have to die .\nIt just breeds hostility and resentment between two countries that have these historic roots and ties .\nI think war can only be accepted as an absolute last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that , while I understand the central role of the US in creating this tinderbox , I still condemn any illegal invasion of another country .\nI think , as leftists , we shouldn \u2019 t be afraid to say : \u201c This is wrong .\nThis is a violation of international law , \u201d that a standard of law needs to be applied equally to every country in the world .\nI think that \u2019 s consistent with progressive values : to be repelled by bombs and troops entering a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen .\nAnd , while I fully recognize and understand Russia \u2019 s security concerns , I am afraid that this is going to escalate tensions , that this action could lead to a potentially catastrophic conflict .\nThere \u2019 s this weird tendency\u2014and I think maybe it has to do with this glorification of war , the culture that militarism has baked into American society\u2014especially as anti-imperialists , I think that , justifiably so , I reflexively tend to defend countries that are under attack from the US empire , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reflexively take the PR of a huge capitalist country , basically using this line of denazification .\nI think it is very clear , to me at least , that this is not necessarily about denazifying Ukraine .\nIt \u2019 s about Russia stepping in and saying , \u201c We \u2019 re not gon na fucking take this anymore .\nWe are going to assert ourselves on the world stage.\n\u201d It \u2019 s okay to have criticisms of that attitude and policy\u2014and to just not kind of blindly have this celebratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need to just reflexively defend what Russia is doing .\nI feel like there has to be a nuanced discussion where we give oxygen to many facets on the left .\nThis includes people in the communist parties in Russia .\nIt includes leftists , who I \u2019 m sure are protesting the invasion in the streets right now .\nI want to get into that too , Brian , but I also want to get into what Putin \u2019 s speech actually detailed .\nHis speech announced this military operation\u2014and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s very hard to find the transcript in Western media , of course , they just pick out the facets that are the most bellicose and belligerent\u2014talking about how \u201c we \u2019 re a nuclear-armed power \u201d and \u201c we \u2019 re going to retaliate with our full nuclear arsenal if anyone tries to impede what we \u2019 re doing.\n\u201d Of course , those are picked up and put on the front pages .\nBut what you don \u2019 t see are all of the excerpts about NATO that legitimize everything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has used to justify this .\nAnd it also really omits this entire bizarre , anti-communist underpinning of what he \u2019 s doing .\nCan you speak to this virulent focus on anti-communism ?\nHe talks about the Soviet policy of self-determination , Lenin and the Bolsheviks , and the Russian empire under the Czar .\nI guess just walk us through this speech\u2014and also the division , the space that we need to understand the difference of opinions on the left in this instance .\nBB : Yeah .\nI \u2019 m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to address all of these issues , in fact , including what the orientation should be of the US anti-war movement or , for myself , Marxist and socialist movement .\nI want to be able to have enough time to be able to address that because I feel that this is a terrible war , because , as you said , there \u2019 s so much death and destruction that happens in any war .\nAnd also the fact that\u2014Russians are invading Ukraine , and Russians are killing Ukrainians , and Ukrainians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the Soviet people , working together against fascism up until the collapse of the Soviet Union .\nIt can \u2019 t be more tragic and more distressing .\nI think to light-heartedly become a cheerleader , or think that this is just a wonderful event , is a disgrace , actually , in terms of a correct understanding of the history .\nI do believe that the United States is responsible for the crisis .\nI do believe the United States presented to Putin , and to the Russian establishment , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made clear were unacceptable\u2014and that under no circumstances were they going to allow Ukraine to be a staging ground for advanced nuclear missiles against Russia .\nSo Russia , I think , for the past few months has been saying : \u201c Let \u2019 s negotiate .\nThese are our red lines .\nWe \u2019 re really serious .\nWe \u2019 re amassing 150,000 troops to show you how serious we are .\nAnd , in each and every instance , the US said no to that\u2014where it would have been so easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been wrong with Ukraine having been a neutral country ?\nI want to just say I really , fully\u2014while I don \u2019 t support Russia \u2019 s invasion into Ukraine\u2014want to emphasize , especially for Americans , how the United States government , the government that speaks in our name , is fully responsible for this getting to this point .\nIt didn \u2019 t need to be this place , which doesn \u2019 t mean Putin and the Russian government don \u2019 t have responsibility as well .\nI want to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your question about Putin \u2019 s speech .\nIt was an extremely revealing speech .\nHe made it February 21st\u2014he \u2019 s made three speeches , I believe , this week now\u2014which is the day before the coup , eight years to the day before the coup that changes everything in Ukraine .\nHe gives a historic explanation for why\u2014it \u2019 s a long grievance about Russia \u2019 s relationship with Ukraine .\nHe blames Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks for the current crisis and for the dissolution of the Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the man who appointed Putin to be his successor\u2014Boris Yeltsin , who was a capitalist counter-revolutionary\u2014was , in fact , the person who literally dissolved the Soviet Union on December 16 , 1991 , when he signed a decree , illegally and arbitrarily , ending the Union .\nHe was the president of Russia at that time .\nSo , Putin doesn \u2019 t condemn Boris Yeltsin , the capitalist counter-revolutionary .\nInstead , he condemns Lenin .\nAnd Lenin \u2019 s sin , according to Putin , is twofold .\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate republic , by the Treaty of 1922 that forms the Soviet Union in 1924 , in the constitution .\nThere \u2019 s a treaty signed between a few republics : Russia , Ukraine , Belarus .\nThey formed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics , and , in that constitution that ratifies that in 1924 , it \u2019 s also stipulated that each of the republics has the right to secede\u2014meaning the right to be self-determining , the right of self-determination , the right to leave the Union if they feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do for the people of that republic .\nLenin insisted on this right of self-determination because he said , \u201c Our problem in building socialism in the territories of the former Russian empire is great Russian chauvinism , \u201d meaning that Russia , which was the prison house of oppressed minorities and minority peoples and ethnicities and nationalities , cultivated the equivalent of kind of a white supremacy against the other non-Russian peoples .\nLenin said : \u201c To build solidarity between Ukrainian and Georgian workers , or the workers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former Russian empire , we have to show we \u2019 re past that .\nWe \u2019 re past that .\nAnd , as a matter of fact , not only are we past it but your connection or federation or union with us , with us Russians , will be based on your right to divorce , your right to say , \u2018 The marriage isn \u2019 t working.\n\u2019 \u201d The right of self-determination , the right of secession , is for republics what the right of divorce is for couples .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , if you feel the relationship isn \u2019 t working , you can leave .\nIf all the power is one side of the relationship and there \u2019 s no power , no ability , for the other side to leave , then it \u2019 s not a real marriage .\nIt \u2019 s a subjugation .\nLenin said the only way to build international solidarity between the various working classes of different ethnicities and nationalities is to guarantee the right of self-determination .\nAnd Putin demagogically says , \u201c If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could call it Vladimir Lenin \u2019 s Ukraine , \u201d because , by creating Ukraine and allowing it to be independent from Russia , that meant that they sowed the seeds for the later dissolution of the Soviet Union .\nAnd he said , \u201c This is a theft by the Bolsheviks of Russian land from Russia.\n\u201d When we heard that speech on February 21st , we , in the PSL and in the left , were like : \u201c What the hell ?\n\u201d We \u2019 ve never heard Putin develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously Putin says Lenin made a mistake at Brest-Litovsk , meaning when they signed the treaty\u2014this is part of his speech\u2014he said he gave Ukraine away to Germany .\nThe treaty that was signed in March 1918 between the Russian revolutionary government and the German empire at Brest-Litovsk allowed Germany to basically annex Ukraine .\nBut Lenin \u2019 s position at that time was : \u201c We had a revolution .\nWe no longer have an army .\nWe \u2019 re being invaded by 14 imperialist armies .\nWe can \u2019 t fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ll sign a treaty .\nIt \u2019 s a humiliating treaty , but we don \u2019 t have any option .\nWe can \u2019 t do it.\n\u201d And so Putin demagogically denounces Lenin for having signed the treaty , which was absolutely necessary for the Russians to do .\nHe also denounces Lenin for having the position of revolutionary defeatism .\nIt \u2019 s clear that revolutionary defeatism meant that the Bolsheviks took the position : \u201c We preferred the defeat of our own czarist government , or bourgeois government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory because our real enemy is at home .\nOur real enemy are the capitalists here .\nThey \u2019 re not in Germany or France or Britain or the United States .\nWe \u2019 re fighting the class struggle here.\n\u201d He also recommended that the German comrades and the French comrades and the British comrades and the American comrades take the same position of not defending their own imperialist bourgeoisie in the war .\nSo , Putin denounces Lenin for revolutionary defeatism .\nHe says that \u2019 s unpatriotic , it gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Brest-Litovsk , he denounces him for creating Ukraine , and he denounces him for the right of self-determination .\nThat can only be understood , by anybody who \u2019 s paying attention to history and politics , that Putin \u2019 s appeal the day before he \u2019 s about to invade Ukraine is not to the left .\nIt \u2019 s not to the workers and to the peasants of Ukraine .\nThis is an appeal to the Russian right , and I think it \u2019 s really important for the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the aggressor , to not follow Putin\u2014not to put Putin on a pedestal , not to follow this anti-communist core , sort of Russian chauvinist orientation towards non-Russian peoples .\nI mean , he says other things that are not chauvinistic , but nonetheless he was making this really unique historical argument for why Ukraine could be reincorporated into Russia as it had been under the Czar .\nThen , the invasion happens .\nAnd it \u2019 s clear .\nWhat \u2019 s the purpose of the invasion ?\nWhat is Putin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s trying to make it one .\nWe have to be very clear about this .\nPutin is trying to make it clear to NATO : Ukraine will never be part of NATO .\nThat \u2019 s obviously what he \u2019 s saying .\nTwo , he says he \u2019 s going to denazify the country , meaning the fascists who are attacking the people in the East are going to be captured , and they \u2019 re going to be put on trial , or they \u2019 re going to be killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThat will be a very popular talking point in Russia .\nUnfortunately , some people in the West think that all of Ukraine is nazified , which is not true .\nThat \u2019 s not what Ukraine is .\nThat \u2019 s not a correct , objective , accurate assessment .\nThe other thing is that he \u2019 s signaling to the West , and this is very important , that the period of appeasement between Russia and the West that \u2019 s existed since 1991\u2014when they appeased them on Iraq , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped appeasing on Syria\u2014now has ended .\nHe said : \u201c We wanted to have a negotiated settlement , but you said no .\nWe \u2019 re done with negotiating .\nWe \u2019 re now going to show you that Russia is a great power.\n\u201d And so that \u2019 s why this has changed global politics : because it \u2019 s the re-emergence of Russia under a bourgeois leadership , demonstrating that it is a major world power and willing to use military force against NATO or NATO-inspired machinations .\nNothing like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collapse of the Soviet Union .\nAM : Exactly .\nAnd I want to get to some of the audience questions in a second , but I wanted to just dovetail off of what you \u2019 re saying to just talk about the disgusting Eurocentrism at play across the Western media .\nIt is quite disgusting that everyone lines up in outrage when Europeans are being attacked , yet , in the same week , Yemenis , Somalis have also been bombed .\nThis is by these same Western forces who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pretending to be the moral arbiter of everything that \u2019 s good and holy .\nIt \u2019 s just disgusting because it really reveals this is a conscious decision to keep these wars going , being fueled by the worst partnerships on Earth\u2014Saudi , Israel , the list goes on and on .\nThen you get to the fog of war\u2014and , apologies if I sound differently , my computer was dying , so I had to take out the mic\u2014Brian , where it \u2019 s actually really hard to discern what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEverywhere you look , there \u2019 s a discrepancy in casualty count , in troop deployment , in targets .\nEven the videos and pictures that we \u2019 re seeing I can \u2019 t trust yet because they \u2019 ve already had to issue retractions , saying : \u201c Oh no , that \u2019 s from Israel bombing Gaza .\nOh no , this is from a video game , actually.\n\u201d It \u2019 s quite ludicrous .\nSo it really is hard to even figure out what to think as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have talking points coming out there , saying the Ukrainian army is basically falling apart , they look super weak , they \u2019 re forcing people to conscript .\nSky News is hosting a live workshop on how to build a Molotov cocktail .\nYou can not make this up .\nMeanwhile , Palestinians are terrorists for throwing rocks at tanks .\nI almost wonder , is this some sort of head fake ?\nLike , the Ukrainian army is so weak that now we need to pour more money and weapons\u2014and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Biden just did today .\nHe just announced that he \u2019 s sending another $ 350 million , I think , in weapons , instead of ceasing everything and saying : \u201c We need to negotiate right now .\nWe need to take this seriously .\nWe need to sit down at the table.\n\u201d Instead , they \u2019 re just funneling more money and weapons into a very , very volatile situation .\nI just can \u2019 t really go without saying this : I think that there were several other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see if the paperwork was about to be signed on the NATO alliance and Ukraine was about to step into NATO .\nThis was not imminent\u2014in terms of if Russia didn \u2019 t invade today , they would have joined NATO tomorrow .\nDiplomacy could have been pursued on the grounds of maybe lobbying other NATO states , like Germany , to potentially take Russia \u2019 s side .\nLet \u2019 s just give Russia the benefit of the doubt .\nOkay , they wanted to go in and protect these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being fueled by the US .\nWell , they didn \u2019 t stop there , right ?\nAs we know , they went beyond the independent regions , and , they now are attempting , it looks like , to go full steam ahead , taking the capital and potentially pursuing regime change across the whole country , depending on how this all plays out .\nSo , for me , if Russia \u2019 s big concern was stopping Ukraine from joining NATO , I feel like this was not an imminent enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all options were exhausted here .\nWhat do you think ?\nBB : Yeah , I think that the political goal , or the military-political goal , of the Russian military intervention is to create a new government in Ukraine .\nAnd , I think , up until now , they \u2019 ve been demanding that Ukraine be neutral .\nBut if , in fact , Russia selects the new government in Ukraine , it won \u2019 t be neutral .\nIt will be part of a Russian sphere of influence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem for Russia\u2014and I don \u2019 t know what the calculation is\u2014Putin said , \u201c We \u2019 re not going to occupy the land.\n\u201d But , when you carry out this large-scale military intervention and want to create a new , pro-Russian government , or a government that swears it won \u2019 t join NATO , how do you enforce that without occupation ?\nThis is an unknown right now , in terms of the military factor .\nAnd , I agree with you , the fog of war , either just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or because it \u2019 s deliberately created , we don \u2019 t really know what \u2019 s going on .\nIt \u2019 s really important for people in the left , in the anti-war movement\u2014who are independent voices against their own government \u2019 s imperialist orientation and policy and structures\u2014not to think we know things that we don \u2019 t know , not to become experts and profound speakers about that which we have very scant information .\nSo , we don \u2019 t really know , but if Ukraine \u2019 s resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t a quick rollover by the Russian military , this thing could escalate very rapidly into a regional or global conflict .\nWhen we talk about this as a new day in global politics , this is a new day that could lead to a kind of crisis that the world , and certainly Europe , hasn \u2019 t seen since the late 1930s .\nPeople should not minimize the absolute danger .\nFor Americans especially , we have to say to our government , or the government that speaks in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aggressive actions have brought the world possibly to the brink of World War III , \u201d which doesn \u2019 t mean you have to then endorse every military move or political statement of the country that the United States or NATO are in conflict with .\nYou don \u2019 t have to do that .\nWe can retain an objective faculty .\nIf the goal of the Russian military is to carry out regime change\u2014which it seems like that \u2019 s what the goal is , the goal is to have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s committed to Russia or to not entering NATO\u2014that means this is a long-term operation that we \u2019 re just at the beginning of .\nThe only way that could conceivably end would be if there \u2019 s an emergency summit whereby the United States\u2014and NATO powers , but it \u2019 s really the United States , it \u2019 s the Americans\u2014sat down with the Russians and said : \u201c Look , here \u2019 s what we \u2019 re going to do .\nYou leave right now .\nWe \u2019 re gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe \u2019 re gon na absolutely go along with your idea that Ukraine will not be moved into a NATO sphere of influence.\n\u201d It doesn \u2019 t need formal membership .\nUkraine was becoming a de facto member of NATO without formal membership .\nBut the US could stop right now and say , \u201c Let \u2019 s do that.\n\u201d Is there a will , a desire , or the courage within the US government to say , under the circumstances of a Russian military offensive in Ukraine , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concessions to Russia ?\nI don \u2019 t think so .\nI don \u2019 t see Biden\u2014or any of these hardliners from either party , the whole American political scene is hardliner\u2014doing it .\nThat \u2019 s why this is such a dangerous moment .\nWe don \u2019 t know how it ends .\nWe don \u2019 t know how this ends .\nBut we do know that the Russians have decided that they \u2019 re done negotiating .\nAgain , I just want to emphasize for people : don \u2019 t be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at what \u2019 s happened .\nThe Putin government in Russia has decided that the era of appeasement with the West has ended and they \u2019 re going to use military force to recreate a buffer zone for what they think is necessary for Russian security .\nWhen you look at the cost-benefit outside of the war\u2014you mentioned the horror of war , the loss of life , the loss of human solidarity , the awfulness of war .\nJust think about some of the other costs to the Russians .\nGermany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States including Ukraine into NATO .\nGermany was not for it at all .\nThe German people in the main don \u2019 t want this .\nEuropeans , who know what war is like because they had World War I and World War II , they don \u2019 t want war .\nSo , the idea that this invasion will give Russia more security remains to be seen .\nI mean , it might , if there \u2019 s some new negotiations\u2014or it could mean that Russia has lost the possible support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a very weak support .\nBut I felt that the Russians were kind of winning the information war in the last couple months , because the world didn \u2019 t want this to happen .\nAnd the world was sort of confronted with the choice : do you really want to militarize Ukraine and risk World War III , or not ?\nI think the cards that the Russians had , that they were playing with , they \u2019 ve played them now .\nRight now , they \u2019 re being just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the left is protesting against NATO and against Russia .\nThere are different parts of the left .\nThere \u2019 s the old CP left , led by the KKE in Greece , and some of the other main parties , the historic parties of the world communist movement , they now say , \u201c Look , Russia is an imperialist country and these are two imperialisms fighting each other.\n\u201d Ironically , the Trotskyists\u2014or semi-Trotskyists like the Cliffites , who were around the ISO\u2014they \u2019 ve always had the position that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even before the collapse of the Soviet Union .\nThey now say : \u201c This is two imperialisms fighting each other.\n\u201d Other people have taken more nuanced positions .\nFrom my point of view\u2014and from the point of view of PSL , and certainly my point of view , as a long-time Marxist and socialist\u2014I don \u2019 t view Russia as a part of the imperialist world .\nI think that if Russia had been admitted into the imperialist club , they would have been glad to join at a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the US views Russia .\nThe US has viewed , since 2000 , and really since 1997 , that if Russia gets back on its feet at all , the US obviously wouldn \u2019 t incorporate .\nRussia asked , \u201c Why don \u2019 t you incorporate us into NATO ?\n\u201d By the way , the Soviets asked that , too , in 1954 , before they formed the Warsaw Pact .\nStalin had just died .\nThe Soviets said , \u201c Look , we \u2019 ll join NATO , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d in 1954 .\nTo which the US , at that time , said : \u201c No , you \u2019 re not coming into NATO , and , by the way , we \u2019 re going to incorporate West Germany into NATO.\n\u201d So that was when the Soviets formed the Warsaw Pact .\nNow , the reason the United States can \u2019 t treat Russia as an equal major power\u2014even though it \u2019 s a big country\u2014isn \u2019 t because Russia has this competition with American imperialism for markets and raw materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the world for influence .\nThat \u2019 s not it .\nIf the United States treats Russia as an equal , because it \u2019 s now a capitalist-led country , then Germany and other countries in Europe will gravitate in the direction of Russia .\nThey are the natural trading partners and political partners , especially Germany .\nThe US fears the loss of its hegemony that it established after World War II with the creation of the UN , the creation of the IMF , the World Bank , the Bretton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world currency .\nThe US tried to create a unipolar world then\u2014in 1945 .\nRussia was the Soviet Union .\nIt was a socialist government .\nIt didn \u2019 t have colonies .\nIt wasn \u2019 t part of the world imperialist system .\nIt got basically destroyed as an entity .\nAnd it \u2019 s getting back on its feet\u2014on a capitalist , rather than socialist , basis .\nThat doesn \u2019 t mean that there should be equivalency between Russia and the US , France , Britain , and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s precisely because Russia is not in the imperialist camp that it can gravitate , under pressure from US imperialism , in the direction of the People \u2019 s Republic of China , which is led by a communist party , gravitate in the direction of supporting Iran , supporting Cuba , supporting Venezuela , supporting Nicaragua .\nIn other words , even though it \u2019 s a bourgeois country , because it \u2019 s not in the imperialist club , it is being pushed in the direction of the more progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons , but for reasons of national self-interest .\nAM : Right , and I think that addresses one of the questions in the chat : why didn \u2019 t Russia join NATO ?\nI think , as you just elucidated , that they would have\u2014if they were invited .\nThis is a strategic encroachment , purposefully for that goal , Brian .\nI wanted to add to your point by just stating , the National Defense Strategy clearly states that , quote , their \u201c principal priority is to counter Russia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that is sustained investment in lethal force.\n\u201d Pretty dystopian , the way that this is laid out in national security documents .\nI think that people give Putin a little too much credit sometimes , as this brilliant 5D chess operator .\nYou certainly hear stuff like that coming from Trump and others , that this is just some brilliant strategy that he \u2019 s gamed out for years and years .\nI think that , to your point , this is a very volatile situation , and we just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to pan out .\nWe shouldn \u2019 t act very glib about this , acting like this is a one-and-done type thing , that Russia \u2019 s just punking NATO and the US , and that Ukraine \u2019 s going to immediately fold .\nI just don \u2019 t think that we should look at anything that way .\nAnd I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s as simple as that , because we simply have no idea how this is going to evolve .\nRussia could very certainly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s been very well-trained and backed by the CIA .\nAnd , of course , NATO and the US can certainly respond in a very reckless way that essentially brings the official start of World War III .\nWhat we do know , also , is that this legitimates the very worst policies and people in the US\u2014that \u2019 s aside from the point , though\u2014that have been lying to us for decades .\nNow they have this whole new credibility that we \u2019 re gon na have to fight , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe main point that I want to get to now is the issue of unipolarity , as you \u2019 ve been talking about , and how it has been wavering in recent years\u2014and how now we \u2019 re facing a precipice where the world is going to be changed moving forward .\nFinally , a big power has stood up and said , \u201c We \u2019 re not going to take this anymore.\n\u201d They \u2019 ve basically moved militarily to assert that new fork in the road .\nA lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brian .\nThis is good because you have this counterweight officially standing against the US .\nThis profound shift is taking place that is going to benefit the world in a positive way\u2014that , no matter what the outcome here is , Russia asserting itself on the global stage will inevitably actually prevent the cataclysmic war that would have happened come Ukraine join NATO .\nLet \u2019 s talk about that .\nIs it good that unipolarity has been challenged ?\nAnd do you agree that this act will prevent a potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Super important question because I hear , all the time , people who hate US imperialism and the unipolar world\u2014where the US could try to destroy government after government after government , sanction them , impose draconian economic sanctions so that even if it wasn \u2019 t occupying or bombing , they were still killing the people and ruining whole countries , making their economy scream\u2014people want an option .\nThey \u2019 re thinking : \u201c That \u2019 s the unipolar world .\nWhat we need is the multipolar world.\n\u201d And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marxist and as a Leninist , I think this is a very superficial understanding of world politics\u2014and a superficial understanding of the historical dynamics for the larger movements for peace and for justice .\nWe had a multipolar world all the way up until World War II .\nWhat did it bring us ?\nThe multipolar world brought us World War I .\nThe multipolar world brought us World War II .\nIf you go back to the Berlin Conference of 1884 , all the imperialists sat together and they took a map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amongst themselves .\nAnd , with the exception of Ethiopia , in 18 years , every form of African self-governance was extinguished .\nThat was where the imperialists were working together .\nA multipolar world where they decided to work together .\nThey had their own contradictions within the imperialist capitalist system because each economy kept producing more and more and more , had more capital to export , needed more markets .\nEventually , because the entire world was already colonized , the only way for a capitalist country to thrive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the other imperialists\u2014and that \u2019 s what made World War I inevitable .\nPlease read the book \u201c Imperialism : The Highest Stage of Capitalism \u201d by Vladimir Lenin .\nWe reproduced it\u2014and we also made up a century-long sort of commentary that is the first part of our book , called \u201c Imperialism in the 21st Century.\n\u201d We took what Lenin wrote because it \u2019 s still valid , the essence of it is completely valid , but things have changed .\nSo we wanted to talk about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if anything , the world situation requires an amendment to Lenin \u2019 s thesis .\nBut again , we agree that , under capitalism and in the imperialist era , the inevitability of war demonstrates itself over and over and over again\u2014and the only solution is not multipolarity .\nThe only solution is socialism .\nThe only solution is to reorganize the economy so that\u2014instead of endless expansion on the basis of capitalist competition that pits different nation states against each other for markets or colonies or semi-colonies or spheres of influence\u2014we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world should actually unite against their own capitalists .\nWe don \u2019 t want them to be separate from , and independent from , the other capitalists in pursuing their own independent capitalist interests and then we can say , \u201c Oh look , there \u2019 s alternatives in the world.\n\u201d Those alternatives will lead to ruination .\nThey lead to the inevitability of war .\nNow , of course , the Soviet Union and the socialist camp sort of did away with America \u2019 s plans for a unipolar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wasn \u2019 t a multipolar world then .\nIt was a bipolar world\u2014bipolar meaning there were two centers and one of the centers was based on socialism .\nThe socialist countries didn \u2019 t have colonies .\nThey didn \u2019 t have neo-colonies .\nThey weren \u2019 t driven by the capitalist mode of production to go to war endlessly and , in fact , they were a deterrent to war .\nSo the non-unipolar nature of the post-World War II era shouldn \u2019 t be characterized as multipolarity , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that there were two anchors was that one of the anchors was based on the socialist system .\nSo , multipolarity is not the answer .\nThe only answer to the inevitability of war\u2014which includes World War III , which will be a nuclear war\u2014is for us to change our own governments , to have radical transformations at home , and to recognize that , in order for that to happen , we have to have independent socialist movements .\nHow can we make radical change in America by saying Vladimir Putin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does in the Ukraine is our source of inspiration ?\nI mean , that \u2019 s ridiculous .\nWe have to fashion a movement in the United States that exposes the role of the Pentagon and imperialism and US machinations and the hardliners in both parties , and say : \u201c They speak in our name but they \u2019 re not us .\nWe are the working class .\nWe are the poor .\nWe are the unrepresented , the unspoken for , in society.\n\u201d We have to fight the battle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build internationalism and human solidarity between workers and oppressed people here and in other parts of the world\u2014but not to look for multipolarity as the solution because indeed unipolarity will end .\nIt is ending .\nWe see it \u2019 s ending right now .\nIt \u2019 ll end in various different forms .\nThe American empire is too overstretched to maintain this fantasy of unipolarism .\nBut simply having other centers of power is not the solution .\nThe solution is indeed socialism because it \u2019 s a system that doesn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s not based on competition .\nIt \u2019 s based on human cooperation between people at home and people all over the world .\nAM : Well said , especially since these forces that are in the multipolar world are also anti-communist .\nI encourage people to read the PSL statements .\nI liked a lot of what they had to say .\nI think it \u2019 s important to quote one of them , which says , \u201c The role of the US anti-war movement is not to follow the lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to present an independent program of peace and solidarity and anti-imperialism , \u201d which is exactly what you \u2019 re pointing out , Brian .\nWe know that , as people in the anti-war movement , our job is to highlight the focus on what our government is doing , what its role is in facilitating and stage managing this crisis .\nAt the same time , a lot of average people are watching the corporate media .\nThat \u2019 s all they really know .\nThey \u2019 re watching this unfold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion of Ukraine .\nThey \u2019 re repelled by war .\nWe need to be reaching out to those people and saying : \u201c Yes , this is wrong , but we \u2019 re Americans .\nDo you live in a NATO country ?\nDo you live in America ?\n\u201d Our central role is to fuel that outrage into pressuring our own government to de-escalate tensions and to pull back NATO forces in these areas .\nTalk about why disbanding NATO is such a crucial demand that anti-war activists need to generate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent program to use to galvanize the left in an international sense .\nBB : Right .\nNATO is foundationally an offensive military alliance .\nIt was designed to stop the spread of socialism .\nIt was designed to make Western Europe basically under the complete subjugation of American imperialism .\nAmerican imperialism , in fact , revived Nazism , or Nazis , in many , many different sectors of West Germany\u2014and , of course , used Nazis to build the US space program .\nOperation Paperclip , people should check that out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States .\nIt \u2019 s not an anti-fascist alliance .\nIt \u2019 s an anti-communist , anti-socialist , anti-worker alliance .\nWe can see that\u2014its wars in Afghanistan , its wars in Libya , its wars against Yugoslavia\u2014these are offensive operations .\nThe people of the United States need to stand together and say no to NATO .\nThe only reason NATO expanded after the collapse of the Soviet Union was not to keep West Europeans safe from the Soviet Union\u2014because the Soviet Union was gone .\nThe only reason it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominate Eastern and Central Europe and make it an American-dominated neo-colony .\nAmerica is addicted to war .\nIts capitalist system\u2014US capitalism\u2014is so addicted to war , so hyper-addicted to militarism , and so addicted to a military-industrial complex as a stabilizing force in US capitalism .\nIt actually incentivizes war .\nAnd then the idea that any country\u2014be it China , be it Iran , be it Russia\u2014can actually be free , can be independent , can be strong enough as a global or regional player that it can determine its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an existential threat because it \u2019 s like the mafia .\nThey say : \u201c Well , if this country can show that it \u2019 s neutral , that it \u2019 s independent , that it \u2019 s not following the empire , that might suggest to others that they too could be independent.\n\u201d The idea of being independent\u2014independent , not communist even , but just independent\u2014is considered a great danger by the US , which is following the logic of gangsterism , which is the logic of contemporary empire .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATO , but NATO , in a way , is also just a symptom .\nThe real disease is American capitalism .\nUS capitalism : it \u2019 s so rich .\nAnd it got rich off the unpaid labor of millions of enslaved Africans or African-descendant people .\nIt got rich off of the genocide and theft of indigenous land .\nIt got rich off of the colonization of Latin America and other parts of the world .\nIt \u2019 s a very rich country\u2014and yet , half the people in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Campaign , live either in poverty or near poverty .\nThe number of billionaires grew , and their wealth increased by 30 percent during the time of COVID-19 , while 60 million workers lost their jobs .\nWe have to fight here against a system of capitalism which breeds injustice , lives off of inequality , and promotes war abroad as a characteristic feature , not as a mistake by this or that politician .\nSo , our struggle really has to be to fight for peace , to fight holistically against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAM : And the true victims of any war , Brian , are the working class of these respective countries .\nThat \u2019 s who \u2019 s going to suffer and needlessly die .\nRussia , Ukraine , those working-class populations\u2014that \u2019 s the tragedy of this all\u2014and , of course , the working class here .\nThank you so much for your incredible and profound analysis .\nI want to address a couple questions in the chat to wrap this up .\nThank you everyone for sticking with us .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial moving forward to understand this in-depth history and how we got to this point , and what we can do to really pressure our government to stop escalating the tensions .\nBrian , we forgot .\nSomeone brought up the Minsk agreement .\nThis is an important facet that \u2019 s not talked about very much that has to do with those semi-autonomous regions .\nDo you want to discuss this ?\nBB : Yeah , absolutely .\nVery important .\nThere \u2019 s two agreements : Minsk I and Minsk II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the coup in February 2014 .\nThey \u2019 re signed later in the year\u2014and , in 2015 , updated .\nThey provide the basis for basically freezing the conflict .\nDon \u2019 t bring in more weapons , freeze the conflict , try to have a mediated solution .\nThe pro-fascist or fascist forces , in Ukraine in particular , violated those agreements over and over again for the reason I stated earlier : they actually want conflict with Russia .\nThey see : if you can hit the Russian population in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe you \u2019 ll lure the Russian government into a battle .\nAnd they think that would be very good because it will increase Ukrainian nationalism , anti-Russian sentiment , and especially bring in heavy weapons from Western countries .\nSo , Minsk was the agreement that the Russians really were committed to .\nThis is so important because , again , if you think of Putin as just the evil devil\u2014whatever we think of Putin , obviously we \u2019 re not supporting Putin , but we need to have an objective faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these agreements .\nFor the last eight years , they have been promoting them at the same time as they \u2019 ve been demanding that Ukraine not come into NATO .\nI would have to say that , as a consequence of the constant and endless violations , mainly by the United States .\nWhen you think of Obama\u2014and I know everybody has many criticisms of Obama , same here\u2014Obama , compared to Trump or Biden , was a voice of restraint .\nHe would not allow weapons to be sold to or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were signed .\nObama said : \u201c Don \u2019 t do this because it \u2019 s going to accelerate a conflict with Russia .\nWe don \u2019 t need it.\n\u201d Trump comes in in 2017 .\nThe Democrats all accuse Trump of being Putin \u2019 s agent\u2014and that the only reason he \u2019 s president is that Putin put him there .\nSo there \u2019 s all this demonization for progressive people who don \u2019 t want Donald Trump to be their president , which is understandable .\nBut they \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kremlin .\nAmerica couldn \u2019 t have somebody like Donald Trump , only Russia could make this happen .\nOnly Russia could impose Donald Trump on our country.\n\u201d All of that said about Donald Trump , Trump sends weapons to Ukraine .\nAnd then , when he held them up for a couple weeks , remember ?\nHe \u2019 s impeached .\nThe Democrats impeached Trump in July based on the fact that he was trying to get Zelensky to do some of his dirty work against Biden and Biden \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expose Hunter Biden , and Zelensky was like : \u201c I don \u2019 t know .\nI don \u2019 t know if I want to do that.\n\u201d He was like , \u201c Okay , we \u2019 re not going to send you weapons.\n\u201d By the way , the US always calls them defensive weapons .\nWell , you can call a missile a defensive weapon , but if it \u2019 s landing on you , it doesn \u2019 t feel defensive .\nLet \u2019 s just get rid of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons .\nSo , Trump comes in and , instead of being Putin \u2019 s stooge , he \u2019 s sending more and more advanced weapons to Ukraine .\nSo , Biden comes in .\nAnd who are Biden \u2019 s people ?\nVictoria Nuland \u2019 s back .\nKurt Campbell , Jake Sullivan , Antony Blinken .\nThat was the Maidan team back in 2014 .\nNow they \u2019 re not just little boys and girls and junior partners playing this role of big bad imperialist .\nNow they really have power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouring all of these weapons into Ukraine , including Turkey \u2019 s drones that are monumentally sophisticated\u2014and some of the drone technology can deliver nuclear weapons .\nThe Russians were completely surprised about how this has accelerated in the past year\u2014then more fighting that violated Minsk , all the time , back in September and October of this year .\nThat \u2019 s when Putin said : \u201c Okay , unless we do something now , we \u2019 re gon na \u20141,200 miles of Ukraine-Russian border\u2014have advanced weapons pointed at us .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s when he had plan A and plan B .\nPlan A was : \u201c We have red lines .\nWe \u2019 re serious .\nYou better listen to us .\nYou better negotiate.\n\u201d Plan B is : \u201c We \u2019 re amassing 150,000 troops.\n\u201d The fact that Biden kept announcing , \u201c They \u2019 re going to invade , they \u2019 re going to invade , they \u2019 re going to invade.\n\u201d I think it \u2019 s because Putin and the Russians weren \u2019 t trying to hide that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they wanted the Americans to know plan B , so you better go with plan A .\nWhen they were rejected , they were like , \u201c Okay , we \u2019 re gon na go for plan B.\n\u201d They played all the cards in their hand .\nI mean , will it be considered historically a reckless , catastrophic move ?\nOr some brilliant counterweight , blah blah , blah , using great power politics , sort of a Bonapartist , militarist answer to imperialism ?\nWe don \u2019 t know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , none of this is unknown .\nThe danger is so high .\nIt \u2019 s already awful for the people in Ukraine .\nThey \u2019 re in their subways .\nThey \u2019 re sheltering .\nWe can \u2019 t look at politics as just geostrategic politics and not care about the people in Ukraine\u2014the workers , the farmers in Ukraine .\nWe care about them just like we care about the workers and farmers in the eastern part of Ukraine , and we care about the workers and farmers in Russia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Georgia , and close to where I am in Washington DC and in nearby Maryland .\nWe have to care about people and the working classes that don \u2019 t make these decisions , that don \u2019 t bring the world to the edge of war , but are told in each and every case : \u201c Line up behind your own government .\nSalute the flag .\nSay the pledge of allegiance .\nDon \u2019 t think about it .\nJust remember what nationality and ethnicity you belong to.\n\u201d As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an internationalist , we \u2019 re promoting the idea that you have to think about the world and world politics in a different way .\nAM : I fully agree , Brian .\nAnother Super Chat question is about Zelensky basically announcing , days before this happened , that he would like Ukraine to have nuclear weapons .\nDays later , Russia invades .\nI know that you talked extensively about NATO\u2014and I just wanted to reiterate and stress that threat of nuclear attack with NATO-armed countries , the fact that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , invites the full response from nuclear-armed states .\nIt \u2019 s a lot of heightened tensions with the entry point into NATO\u2014basically pledging by NATO countries that we have the ability to attack you and essentially bring in nuclear war .\nBB : Yeah .\nI didn \u2019 t see Zelensky \u2019 s actual comment\u2014and a lot of what we \u2019 re hearing we \u2019 re getting as secondhand news sources .\nYou mentioned in the beginning the fog of war .\nDid he say it ?\nMaybe .\nIf he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because obviously they weren \u2019 t about to get nuclear weapons , but it \u2019 s a perfect talking point for the Russians , who are seeking different justifications for their military intervention .\nBut , in the weeks before , Zelensky was telling Biden : \u201c Would you stop threatening Russia ?\nWould you stop saying that an invasion is imminent ?\nYou \u2019 re disrupting our economy .\nYou \u2019 re hurting our economy .\nLike , let \u2019 s chill out.\n\u201d So Zelensky was not , at that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If anything , if you look at Zelensky \u2019 s position , it \u2019 s been a moderating position .\nWhen he came in\u2014he \u2019 s a Russian speaker , he \u2019 s from the southeast part of Ukraine , he got a lot of votes from the eastern part of Ukraine to become the next president\u2014it looked , in the beginning , like he was really wanting to implement the Minsk accords .\nThat was his orientation .\nNow , he \u2019 s been moved further and further and further into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States .\nBut even with that , in the last couple weeks , he was telling the United States , \u201c Please stop with all of this rhetoric.\n\u201d I think , if he said the thing about nuclear weapons , it might be because the invasion was coming , or he knew it was coming .\nMaybe it was reckless talk .\nIf the comment was made , I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s decisive for why Russia has acted .\nYou can \u2019 t have this kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , having been planned far , far in advance .\nThey obviously had this plan worked out .\nAnd then , they were hoping , I think , to have plan A be implemented by showing muscle , showing Russian muscle in the last four months .\nI think they were really hoping that the Germans and the French\u2014and I think that \u2019 s why Putin was talking to the new leadership in Germany and Macron in France , they were having lots of discussions\u2014they were hoping Germany and France would stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Absolutely not .\nLet \u2019 s make a commitment to Russia that Ukraine won \u2019 t come into NATO.\n\u201d And I think that they kind of gave up on that and then decided to go all in with this other strategy .\nAM : Yeah , it was a very risky maneuver , and , of course , we \u2019 re in the middle of it right now , so we have no idea how this is going to play out .\nRight now , as far as I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in response , thankfully .\nReally , it \u2019 s in the hands of\u2014how belligerent is the response going to be from\u2014Western powers and NATO forces .\nBut , as of yet , they haven \u2019 t declared that Russia is going to be removed from the SWIFT European financial agreement .\nAnd the sanctions implemented\u2014maybe you can speak more to that .\nThat \u2019 s also a question in the chat .\nWhat are these sanctions directed at ?\nHow are they going to impact the countries that do rely on Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sanctions hurt Europe .\nEnding Nord Stream 2 has been a dream of American imperialism and a nightmare for the German establishment , not just the German people .\nBy the way , I referred to the Bucharest conference back in 2008 , where the US said , \u201c Ukraine is going to come into NATO , and so is Georgia.\n\u201d It was Angela Merkel\u2014who is the Christian Democratic , right-center leader\u2014who said absolutely not at Bucharest .\nAnd the French also said no .\nSo it \u2019 s both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left-center .\nThey \u2019 re both wanting to have a more independent , more open policy towards Russia , and certainly that \u2019 s partly because Northern Europe really depends on Russian energy sources .\nYou can build all the liquefied natural gas tanks in the world\u2014but that \u2019 s coming then from the UAE , or from the United States , thousands of miles away at much higher cost .\nEurope is going to be hurt by those sanctions .\nAnd then sanctioning the Russian economy , well Russia \u2019 s trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a form of dictatorship , economic dictatorship , imposed against the whole world\u2014mainly on their targets , mainly on the workers and the poor of a targeted society .\nThey hardly have any influence on the elites in that society .\nBut then they have collateral impact on other economies that would prefer to trade with the sanctioned country but can \u2019 t , because if they do , then they will be the sanctions .\nThat was the situation with Iran .\nObama signs the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very excited about it .\nThey want to trade with Iran .\nThey want to get Iranian oil .\nTrump comes in and rips it up .\nAnd what did the European capitalists do , even though they wanted and would benefit from the Iran nuclear arms deal ?\nThey didn \u2019 t stand up to the US .\nAnd why ?\nThey feared that they would become the victims of American sanctions .\nSo American sanctions are a form of global dictatorship against everyone\u2014principally against the targets but also as collateral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is true about Europe right now .\nAM : Let \u2019 s close this up by\u2014I know that you don \u2019 t want to offer any predictions , of course , that would be irresponsible .\nBB : Not about the future .\nNot about the future .\nAM : What do we need to be prepared for , Brian , here , as anti-war activists , as people who genuinely care about peace and preventing our country from continuing this imperialist aggression around the world ?\nBB : Well , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult moment .\nIt \u2019 s going to be hard to go out and be really anti-war and focused on the Pentagon and NATO when it \u2019 s Russia that \u2019 s intervening militarily in Ukraine .\nEveryone will say : \u201c Wait , doesn \u2019 t this give justification for why NATO should expand ?\nDoesn \u2019 t Russia appear to be the aggressor ?\nIsn \u2019 t Russia something to fear and to hate ?\nAnd isn \u2019 t the American rationale justified ?\nBecause , on its face , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we \u2019 re in a period where , at least momentarily , we \u2019 re going to be somewhat isolated .\nIt \u2019 s like right after September 11th , when we formed the ANSWER Coalition .\nWe formed it three days after September 11th .\nWhen we came out and said , \u201c We have to fight against the American war drive , \u201d people were like , \u201c Wait , terrorists just bombed the World Trade Center , or blew it up , and the Pentagon , why are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And we said : \u201c Because this is what \u2019 s going to happen .\nThe US will cynically take advantage of the attacks to do its own thing .\nTo launch new wars of aggression .\nAnd we Americans have to go out and fight.\n\u201d And , at first , people spat upon us .\nWe were really isolated .\nGeorge W. Bush \u2019 s political rating went to 90 percent\u2014and he had been highly unpopular .\nBut over time , that dissipates , and so the truth tellers\u2014the people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their principles , the people who are really anti-war and anti-imperialist\u2014by promoting and agitating against the real danger of war , which comes from our government , the US government , over time people will see that what we \u2019 re saying is actually true , even though , at the moment , it \u2019 s going to be very , very hard .\nSo , we have to stick to our principles .\nWe have to look for opportunities to do public education against war and militarism , explain\u2014what I \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure\u2014about the history of NATO .\nEven though it \u2019 s complicated and hard , we have to do this work .\nI \u2019 m also a member of the International Peoples \u2019 Assembly , which is a new global network of forces fighting for justice and against imperialism , and one of the watchwords of the IPA is to wage the battle of ideas\u2014because , in some ways , we can \u2019 t really influence the outcome right now in Eastern or Central Europe , but the war danger which emanates from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the justification and rationale provided to the American people by the establishment and echoed by the media .\nThat \u2019 s the ideas of the ruling class .\nAs Karl Marx said , \u201c The ideas of any society are the ideas of its ruling class.\n\u201d Well , we\u2014the anti-war people , the people for justice , the people who are socialists\u2014have to fight the battle of ideas because , ultimately , by winning the battle of ideas , by winning working class and poor people over to our side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , we build a mighty force that can actually make change .\nSo , even though at moments it looks bleak , at other moments it looks like the political forces for progress and change are dominating .\nBut unless we have good ideas , solid ideas , ideas anchored in anti-imperialism and socialism and Marxism\u2014in other words , the ideas that are combating the ideas of capitalists of whatever country\u2014we can \u2019 t really ultimately win .\nActivism by itself , while important , isn \u2019 t enough .\nWe have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u2019 s how mass movements are forged and that \u2019 s how they endure and that \u2019 s ultimately how they win .\nAM : Thank you so much , Brian , for taking so much of your time today to explain the situation , to give your crucial insight on where we go from here .\nEveryone tuning in
