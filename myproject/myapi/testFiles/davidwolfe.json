Here\u2019s A Packing List for Ultimate Health", "content": "Really , anytime of the year is a great time to travel .\nBut if it \u2019 s been a while , you may be wondering what to pack to stay healthy .\nAre you traveling soon ?\nThen let \u2019 s get you ready !\nTraveling can be such an adventurous , humbling and learning time .\nIt \u2019 s a time to self-explore , self-experiment , try new flavors and new cuisines , meet new people , explore nature , be exposed to new cultural practices , and so much more !\nWhile there is so much opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are also at a heightened risk of illness .\nWith the change in your environment , being introduced to foreign foods and sources of water and foreign bacteria , it \u2019 s no wonder your system can be easily thrown off balance .\nOn top of that , the stress of traveling can compromise your immunity , your digestion , your sleep cycles , and so on .\nHowever , today , I \u2019 m going to share with you what to pack to be prepared for anything and to maintain optimal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you \u2019 re planning on traveling soon , listen up !\nYou know , we are over 70 % water , right , so it \u2019 s good to be prepared .\nI suggest that you carry an empty , refillable water bottle through airport security \u2013 most preferably a glass water bottle , or mason jar .\nAlthough you can \u2019 t bring liquids through security , you can bring this empty bottle or container , which will save you and the planet a lot of unnecessary waste .\nFill it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 re through your security check , and make sure you drink up and hydrate before your flight and , of course , during the flight .\nKindly ask a flight attendant to fill your bottle for you throughout your flight ; even if they \u2019 re not coming through often with the cart , there is always an abundant supply of water in the back service station .\nAnd what about actually on your adventure ?\nIf you \u2019 ve brought a refillable container , then you can top off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well .\nThis will ensure that you are staying hydrated at all times of the day .\n( 1 ) Ginger and fennel are my favorite as they are super grounding .\nFrom an Ayurvedic perspective , ginger \u2019 s heating qualities make it useful for treating \u201c vata \u201d imbalances .\nVata is the element of air \u2013 something that we are exposed to in excess while traveling .\nSo ginger , an earthy root vegetable , helps to keep us feeling \u201c grounded , \u201d further helping us reconnect with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t forget your skin !\nAlways have some form of natural skin moisturizer on hand , to alleviate the symptoms of dehydrated skin from being in a pressurized air cabin for extended periods of time .\nA small ( leak proof ) container of coconut oil is ideal .\nSince the vast majority of our immune system lies in our gut , keeping the intestinal tract healthy and happy while traveling will keep you feeling great This will also ensure that you enjoy your travels to the utmost extent !\nInvest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrigerated .\nIt \u2019 s a good idea to incorporate beneficial \u2018 bugs \u2019 in your daily regime while traveling , because being exposed to new water sources , foods and time zones naturally has an effect on your natural digestion cycle .\nHaving these supplements on hand are also effective in alleviating any debilitating symptoms of traveler \u2019 s diarrhea .\n( 3 ) This essential mineral acts as a natural relaxant \u2013 that is , it relaxes skeletal muscles , as well as the smooth muscles of blood vessels and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnesium is also a natural tranquilizer , making it a fantastic sleep aid .\nOK \u2013 what a great , natural way to help you adapt to a different time zone !\nMagnesium aids in peristalsis , which aids in proper digestion , promotes motility in the intestinal tract and softens stools .\nFor this reason , it also helps alleviate cramping and constipation due to the dehydrating conditions .\nLast , but not least , magnesium alleviates feelings of nervousness , anxiety , insomnia and fatigue \u2013 some of which can loom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zones frequently .\n( 4 ) Seriously , don \u2019 t travel without it !\nA God-send for travelers , activated charcoal alleviates symptoms of nervous diarrhea , traveler \u2019 s diarrhea , a spastic colon , and indigestion .\nIt \u2019 s great to have on hand when people overdose on drugs or alcohol .\nFor example , you can probably see the need for young adults traveling post-graduation from university .\nWhy ?\nBecause it helps capture and eliminate these toxic compounds from your digestive system .\n( 5 ) Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to alleviate stomach troubles especially nausea .\nBut these are handy , too , when hot tea isn \u2019 t an option .\nGinger may prevent symptoms of motion sickness , including nausea , dizziness and vomiting \u2013 making it great for times of turbulence while flying , traveling on a boat and/or ferry , and so on .\nFinally , ginger contains powerful anti-inflammatory phytonutrients known as gingerols , as well as strong antioxidant and antibacterial properties \u2013 helpful for warding off any foreign invaders !\n( 2 ) This medicinal mushroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps our bodies optimally cope in times of physical and emotional stress and adversity .\nReishi mushroom is known as the \u201c mushroom of immortality.\n\u201d ( 6 ) The ever powerful Reishi boosts and supports the immune system .\nReishi is also referred to as \u201c the great protector , \u201d as it helps guard against the impact of physical , immunological , and mental stressors while traveling .\n( 7 ) \u2022 Personally , I avoid refined sugars , so for me , stevia is a fantastic plant-based , all-natural solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix are always good to have on hand to help you avoid making a poor food choice .\n\u2022 Survival food like quinoa flakes and nuts , for those early mornings when nothing else is available !\n\u2022 Pink Himalayan salt .\nThis is great to have on hand because normally when you eat out , the only option you have is processed , iodized table salt .\nNo , thank you !\nInstead , effortlessly enrich all your meals with electrolytes and trace minerals by having the right salt on hand .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ food bags , and as aforementioned my own water bottle ( don \u2019 t leave home without it ! )\n; all of which I keep in my backpack .\nGuess what that means \u2013 NO WASTE PRODUCTION ( yay ! )\n.\nLymph is a clear , watery fluid that moves through every individual \u2019 s body and sweeps up bacteria and viruses , filtering them out via the lymph nodes .\nThe lymphatic system has no pump \u2013 and for those reasons has to be stimulated or manually pumped by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend on muscle contractions ( in some form of vigorous exercise ) , diaphragmatic breathing [ that is deep breathing ] , dry brushing and massage .\nThat \u2019 s why I like to move around as much as I can during my layovers .\nI want to keep that lymph flowing and to aid my body \u2019 s immunity functions .\n( 8 ) Two key things that I do not travel without are my yoga mat and resistance bands .\nI do yoga and exercise using my resistance bands during layovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my body after sitting for an extended period of time .\nInverted poses are particularly stimulating of lymph .\nSome easy inverted yoga poses you can incorporate in your layover routine are ; downward dog , standing forward bend , supported shoulder stand , headstand , wheel pose , bridge pose and so on .\nDry-brushing is an excellent way to love your lymphatic system for working so very hard to keep you healthy and vibrant !\nThe lymphatic system is composed of organs , lymph nodes , ducts , and vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run smoothly within and throughout the body .\nMany of our lymph vessels run just below the surface of our skin .\nThis is why dry brushing regularly helps stimulate and support a normalized and optimal lymph flow .\nThis naturally helps the body in its detoxification and elimination processes [ by stimulating circulation that is ] .\nOn that same token , dry brushing can be a very energizing and revitalizing practice .\nThis is especially useful when people are feeling groggy and jet-lagged after long traveling hours .\n( 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily practice is to ask yourself what you have done to move your lymph during the day .\nFinally , I want to share with you a cool gadget that I bring everywhere to help support my immune system .\nIt \u2019 s called a Zapper !\nI keep it clipped to my waist and it \u2019 s pretty much unnoticeable .\nThe zapper is a device that was invented to disturb parasites , bacteria , viruses , molds , and fungi with electrical currents .\nHow a zapper works is by sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which creates an environment and space around you [ look at it as your very own personal ozone layer ] that is not conducive to pathogens and foreign invaders .\nIn tandem with that , the positive electrical currents of the zapper stimulate and energize our white blood cells .\nThese specialized little helpers work to eliminate our body \u2019 s worst enemies .\nGreat team work , right ?\nTravel greatly weakens our immune systems , putting a great burden on our bodies .\nFortunately , zapping offers the support that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can engage in all of the activities and fun while you \u2019 re out in the world .\n( 10 ) You deserve to get out there and explore the wonders of the world .\nJust don \u2019 t forget to show love and support to the physical body that allows you to walk through this life with energy , vibrancy , vitality , and love !\nFor more inspiration and healthy recipes , check

, an old monk sat quietly meditating on a mountainside when a snake and a crane began to fight .\nAs he watched , he noticed the interplay of the animals \u2013 one attacking , one defending \u2013 playing out the natural balance of yin and yang .\nHe sought to learn the movements of animals and wove them into a tapestry of energetic play .\nThus , Tai Chi was born !\nThere \u2019 s a bit of embellishment there , but that \u2019 s the beauty of legends .\nWhile the true origins may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the resulting combination of forms became known as Tai Chi , or Grand Ultimate ( more accurately pronounced taiji ) .\nNow , if you \u2019 re looking for a technical history of Taijiquan and Chinese wushu , this isn \u2019 t it .\nInstead , it \u2019 s a Westerners view of the beauty of flowing movement and meditation in motion .\nTai Chi is not just the blending of movements but also of philosophies of ancient China .\nDrawing on the cultures of Taoism , Buddhism , and Confucianism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of each to develop its philosophy of Harmony .\nBut if it \u2019 s simply Harmony , then what are we doing when we \u201c play \u201d Tai Chi ?\nThat flowing movement you see in the parks or in the movies is called Taiji Ch \u2019 uan ( or taijiquan ) .\nWhen we \u201c do \u201d baseball or basketball or football , we play that sport .\nEssentially , participants who play Tai Chi are practicing martial arts .\nTaiji , however , is considered an internal martial art .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ creator of the TaijiFit Method , says it best : \u201c Other martial arts teach us how to hurt each other ; Tai Chi teaches us how to heal each other .\nOther martial arts speak of aggression ; Tai Chi speaks of compassion .\nOther martial arts are rooted in violence ; Tai Chi is rooted in benevolence .\nOther martial arts focus on human conflict and combat ; but in Tai Chi we combat depression , aging and death.\n\u201d ( 1 ) TaijiFit , also called Tai Chi Flow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo when we play Tai Chi , especially using the TaijiFit Method , we are doing our \u201c harmony exercise.\n\u201d The best part about this method of learning Tai Chi is that there is nothing to \u201c get right \u201d \u2013 no form to memorize , no exact way to do the movement .\nWhen I first learned this martial art form , my Grand Master would put my hands in the correct position if I didn \u2019 t get it right myself .\nThen I \u2019 d practice that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two before moving on to the next one .\nIt took three years for me to learn two Taiji Forms in this way ( the Simplified 24 Forms and the Long Chen Form ) .\nSo not only is traditional taiji a slow movement , but it \u2019 s also a slow process !\nAs is true of just about every cultural tradition , Tai Chi has changed when exported to other countries .\nIn the Greater Washington , DC , area , we can find traditional Chinese Taiji , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam .\nI learned a Japanese Tai Chi Form that is particularly calming and meditative .\nTai Chi can also be blended with other meditative traditions , such as yoga , or more energetic movements , such as HIIT .\nBut why ?\nWhat is it about this moving meditation that speaks to many cultures and many practices ?\nWell , for one thing , it truly is a healing art .\nA quick search in PubMed.gov ( the National Library of Medicine online repository of scientific research ) returns over 66,000 studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMy focus has been fall prevention and brain health .\nAccording to a recent article in The Harvard Gazette , the physical benefits include fall prevention , as well as pain management , improved cognition , and reduced stress : ( 2 ) \u201c While Tai chi may offer senior practitioners inner peace , scientists also value it for its fundamental , physical benefits .\nIn addition to improving balance , flexibility , and mental agility , it also reduces falls , the largest preventable cause of death and injury among older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like these ?\nBamboo on the Mountain , Parting Wild Horse \u2019 s Mane , White Crane Spreads Its Wings .\nYou can experience these and many others with this amazing flowing exercise .\nAs a martial art , taiji offers balance and skill .\nAs a meditative movement for the aging brain , taiji promotes calm and challenges the mind and body together .\nIt \u2019 s a full

@ @ @ @ become ritualistic .\nSelf-imposed restrictions , with an exaggerated need for self-care , can begin to overwhelm the pleasure of positive health choices .\nEven the precision for optimal calorie intake can cause neglect and disaffection of social relationships .\nPractically speaking , the exclusion of certain foods or dietary practices is not primarily rooted from a sense of wanting health .\nRather its stems more from an emotional fear of taking something that may deter them from achieving their health goals .\nIn short , attaining a perfect diet trumps all else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolves around this one end .\nLet \u2019 s face it , we all want health , although some are willing to take strides to get it more than others .\nSometimes living healthfully can look a lot like

table .\n( 3 ) Overall , we can send a powerful message of our food values by our consistent yet quiet witness at each fellowship meal .\nLastly , with the intense cravings for the latest nutrient dense superfood dish , let \u2019 s never forget to first ask ourselves if the food is visually appealing and properly assembled .\nPlus , the surprise may come that it mattered more about what you

your whole body , all at once .\nBut the magic ?\nYou do regenerate \u2013 just a little more slowly .\nOver time , you have a brand new , second-hand you .\n\u201c Every moment your body is undergoing an active process of regeneration , based as it is on the ceaseless flux of cell life and death \u2014 not unlike the dissipative structure of a flame.\n\u201d ( 1 ) No doubt , you heard about the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics in High School Chemistry class .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progresses the quality of useable energy in a substance gradually deteriorates .\n( 2 ) Just as the heat of a fire consumes the wood the burns , so too our bodies constantly succumb to the downward process of entropy .\nThankfully , there is a built-in solution , because we are made to constantly regenerate !\nIn approximately 7 years , in fact , you fully regenerate , replacing every single atom and molecule from the food , drink , and lifestyle you led .\nThe result ?\nA new and improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How You Make A Brand New You Let \u2019 s start from the outside in .\nYour epidermal layer , aka skin , is the largest organ of the body .\nWhile human beings can rejuvenate after a good night \u2019

develops upward .\nTrue beauty really is skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe alimentary canal runs the gamut from where food goes in to , well , where it goes out .\nBut we \u2019 re focusing on the intestines , which protect us from the outside world with a single-cell layer called the epithelium .\nThat little lining gets a lot of wear and tear from each meal .\nThis helps explain why the body regenerates the enterocytes ( the uppermost layer of the intestinal tract ) every 3 days .\n( 4 ) The same applies to the stomach .\nDo you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , that \u2019 s essentially hydrochloric acid in your tummy .\nBut the lining of the stomach can take it !\nFor a few days , anyway , before the cells regenerate .\nAnd since all disease begins in the gut , in theory it would take just a few days and a few changes to greatly improve your health .\nOK \u2013 let \u2019 s talk about sex\u2026 Well , not really , but rather the \u2018 seed of life \u2019 .\nFor a male mammal to procreate , he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his semen .\nIf not , then he \u2019 s impotent .\nEver wonder how long it takes for sperm to develop ?\nThe testicles of the male reproductive organ produce both testosterone and sperm cells .\nOnce the pituitary gland in the brain sets off the signal , a chain reaction occurs which finally ques the manufacturing of sperm .\nThe entire process , known as spermatogenesis \u2013 from initial production until final maturation \u2013 takes an average of 72 days , or about 2.5 months .\nThe first two months involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks deals with traveling to the epididymis tube where it remains until ejaculation .\n( 5 ) Daily , men can make several million sperms , totaling up to 8 billion by the end of the cycle .\nWow !\nCool fact , in ideal conditions , a sperm cell can even last up to 5 days in the female reproductive tract before death .\n( 6 ) The body is fueled with the food that we eat , and those nutrients are transported through the river of life \u2013 our blood .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ every ailment requires to heal , and without it we would surely die .\nAfter about 4 months of circulation the red blood cells die off are eliminated in the liver , and new ones take their place .\n( 7 ) Until recently , scientists believed that the brain , once fully developed , was beyond regeneration .\nHowever , we now know that the spongy tissue that controls the rest of

we have a few interesting findings !\nFirst \u2013 Why Do Animals Yawn ?\nWhen it comes to imitations , humans have many psycho-social behaviors figured out down to a T.

.\nSure , you can yawn on purpose , but contagious yawning proves otherwise .\n( 1 ) What is contagious yawning , you ask ?\nIt \u2019 s the \u201c onset of a yawn triggered by seeing , hearing , reading , or thinking about another person yawn.\n\u201d ( 2 ) Maybe it \u2019 s because yawning often leads to feelings of comfort and momentary tranquility .\nWe know it is involuntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11-week-old fetus can yawn .\n( 3 ) In fact , it is a behavior that experts say effects over 60 % of the human populace , not excluding primates , and dogs .\n( 4 ) Granted , when you think of that nice big breath , you may think of boredom and tiredness ( have you yawned yet ? )\nHowever , yawning has several different theories behind it , one of which involves the mental state of empathy .\n( 5 ) Essentially , the scientists demonstrated that , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much a \u201c monkey see , monkey do \u201d sort of business .\nSusceptibility to \u201c catch \u201d a yawn is based upon facial recognition , mind processing , and brain activation in areas related to social cognition .\n( 6 ) How did they confirm this ?\nWell , people with autism actually yawn drastically less when they see others yawn .\nAutism , a disorder that influences social interaction , may help explain contagious yawning .\nNon-autistic people catch yawns more readily .\nThis suggests that humans catch yawns from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apparently , the magic age is around 4 when our empathetic skills of yawning begin to kick in as humans .\n( 7 ) Does It Wake You Up Or Put You To Sleep ?\nAnother theory deals with arousal ( yes , even that kind ) .\nVarious studies indicate that there is an immediate increase in our brain arousal reflex as a result of yawning .\nIt wakes you up !\nThis simple special breath increases your heart rate , even on par with caffeine intake .\nWho wants their next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps explain , at least in part , why yawning is more contagious during lower brain activities , such as viewing television than compared to cooking .\nWe want to wake up !\nYet another theory proposes that we yawn as a way to regulate brain temperature .\nIt turns out that individuals with MS , epilepsy , stress , anxiety , head trauma , or stroke yawn more frequently due to abnormal thermoregulation .\nThose yawns temporarily relieve symptoms associated with those conditions , as a kind of internal thermostat autocorrect mechanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponded to higher rates of yawning , indicating that the body is attempting to cool down the brain from heat stress or hyperthermic states .\nA cooler brain means we can think more clearly and make wiser decisions .\n( 9 ) But Why is Yawning Contagious ?\nWhy do most of us catch the yawn bug ?\nWe still don

about the names and different varieties of helminths that might be infecting your gut .\nThere are three major types of parasite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parasites are also called soil transmitted helminths .\nThis is because the worms that live inside soil or fertilizer are made from feces .\nThere are billions of people on the planet suffering from soil transmitted helminths .\nAll these people are infected by three specific types of helminth : roundworms , whipworms , and hookworms .\nIn addition to those three common types of parasite , we will talk about tapeworms .\nTapeworms are different from the other types of helminths .\nWhen we \u2019 re done talking about the basics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will discuss ways to prevent each one .\nWhile the best way to figure out how to get rid of parasites might be to do a parasite cleanse , we still want to prevent future parasites from coming back .\nThe first type of parasite we will discuss is Ascaris lumbricoides , also known as roundworm .\nThere are nearly one billion people on earth that are infected with roundworm .\nThe parasite lives in your intestine and the eggs are passed through your feces .\nWhen humans or animal waste goes back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can proceed to spread .\nThe roundworm and eggs from pig waste are indistinguishable and when contaminated manure is used for farming the parasites can be passed on to us

helps your body perform proteolysis , which is the breaking down of proteins into smaller elements like amino acids .\nAs with most digestive enzymes , though , proteases do a lot more than just one thing , though .\nIn fact , they contribute to several crucial bodily functions .\nIn this article , we \u2019 ll be exploring why your body needs proteases so badly as well as where you can find them .\nProtease : Where It Fits In The World Of Enzymes Proteases are one of three main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs .\nWhile we explored the other two in detail within our What Are Enzymes article , to summarize , the other two enzymes are lipase , which helps your body digest fat , and amylase , which helps your body process starches and glycogen .\nProteases fall under the category of proteolytic enzymes , which are enzymes that not only help your body process protein but aid in dividing cells , forming blood clots , maintaining your immune system and more .\n( 1 ) In this article , we \u2019 ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ category .\nBut here are the four main classes of proteases so you know what to look out for on ingredient labels and the like : Now , for practical purposes , what you need to know is that all of these protease classes achieve the same thing .\nThey just do it in different ways .\nThink of it as akin to how an electric car and a standard one will both get you from point A to point B , just using different mechanisms .\nWhere Does Protease Come From ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ protease naturally .\nIt \u2019 s only after this inactive protease interacts with the enzyme trypsinogen that your body can use it for the above purposes .\n( 2 ) In addition to your body \u2019 s own natural production , you can receive the enzyme from two additional sources \u2013 supplements and food .\nLet \u2019 s look at food sources first .\nPineapples contain the protease bromelain , which research has proven to be effective at helping combat pancreatic insufficiency .\n( 3 ) We \u2019 ll explore pancreatic insufficiency in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it \u2019 s a condition that reduces your pancreas \u2019 ability to produce the digestive enzymes your body needs .\nIn addition to helping your digestive system , bromelain reduces inflammation , especially in your sinuses .\nSome people even take it to reduce soreness after workouts as well .\n( 4 ) Papaya contains papain , which is another protease that aids in breaking down proteins .\nIn addition , research shows that it may be effective at reducing IBS symptoms like bloating and constipation .\n( 5 ) What \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papain is highly effective at combatting parasitic infections , making it a great addition to a parasite cleanse .\n( 6 ) It \u2019 s worth noting , however , that pregnant women should avoid papaya .\nUnripened or semi-ripe papaya can cause stimulate contractions .\n( 8 ) This popular fermented milk-based beverage contains several digestive enzymes , including protease , lipase , and lactase .\n( 9 , 10 , 11 ) Lactase is an ingredient that helps your body process milk and other dairy products .\nIt \u2019 s especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intolerance .\nSince the pasteurization process kills enzymes , it \u2019 s helpful that fermenting adds this enzyme back in .\nIf you \u2019 re unfamiliar with kefir , it \u2019 s a drink resembling a thin yogurt .\nTo make it , you insert \u201c kefir grains \u201d ( which resemble cauliflower ) into milk .\nThese grains are actually yeasts and helpful bacteria .\nDuring the fermentation process , you leave the drink to sit ( usually overnight ) , and the bacteria digests the milk to produce the enzymes .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Read also about coconut kefir and water kefir .\nKimchi is a Korean dish consisting of fermented vegetables .\nJust like with kefir , kimchi contains healthy bacteria that produces proteases ( among other enzymes , including lipases and amylases , which help you digest fats and carbs respectively ) .\n( 12 , 13 ) In addition to the benefits that come from protease , research also shows that kimchi can lower cholesterol and other risk factors for heart disease .\n( 14 ) No wonder the Japanese are so healthy !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to increased rates of digestive issues .\nMost often , you \u2019 ll find protease included with other enzymes in a comprehensive formula .\nThis is because all enzymes work together to ensure proper digestive function .\nOur modern diets can be messy sometimes , and it \u2019 s not always easy to get the amount of natural protease-containing foods that you need to combat the issue effectively .\nSome medical conditions and lifestyle choices also can contribute to decreased protease levels .\nEssentially , any condition that leads to chronic inflammation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions such as diabetes , inflammatory bowel disease , and pancreatitis can all contribute to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency ( EPI ) .\n( 15 ) EPI occurs when your pancreas is unable to produce the digestive enzymes ( including protease ) that your body needs .\nThankfully , supplements can help restore your body \u2019 s levels of these enzymes when you take them under a doctor \u2019 s supervision .\nWhat The Research Says About Protease Supplements Research confirms that protease supplements are quite effective when it comes to their main feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when patients with indigestion took a protease supplement , their symptoms greatly reduced .\nThese symptoms included bloating , belching , heartburn and reduced appetite .\n( 16 ) Another study found that a protease supplement greatly reduced symptoms of IBS , including bloating , constipation and painful stools .\n( 17 ) As we touched on briefly , though , protease is good for a lot more than just digestion .\nThese additional benefits carry over to protease supplements as well .\nIn one study , researchers found that a supplement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( artificial ) medicine at reducing pain from osteoarthritis .\n( 18 ) Additional research has shown that protease supplements can even reduce swelling in situations as severe as recovery from dental surgery .\nYou know it \u2019 s legit when it can combat that sort of pain !\n( 19 ) Protease is a type of enzyme that helps your body digest protein and turn it into smaller molecules , like amino acids , that your body can use for fuel .\nWhile your pancreas produces protein naturally , there are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ailments like diabetes , cystic fibrosis , pancreatitis or when you smoke cigarettes \u2013 where the organ could use an extra hand .\nThat \u2019
