accountable is the noblest and most essential goal of the journalistic profession .\nBut 2021 may go down in history as the year that our major newsrooms \u2014 shamefully \u2014 gave up on it .\nBefore Trump , if you had asked Americans what was the one thing that could disqualify a party from future participation in democratic politics , they might well have said : Trying to steal a presidential election .\nYet the people who attempted to corruptly \u2014 and , on Jan. 6 , violently \u2014 overthrow the 2020 presidential election are still controlling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work daily to hold the GOP accountable , our top political journalists are glibly projecting that it will take Congress in 2022 and possibly the White House in 2024 .\nThis failure to hold Trump to account has been consistent ever since he declared his candidacy .\nWhen he actually won in 2016 , the heads of our major newsrooms made a terrible mistake : They clung to their devotion to treating both political parties with equal deference \u2013 even though that meant abandoning their even more fundamental commitment to truth-telling and accountability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profoundly unbalanced situation normalized Trump \u2019 s and his party \u2019 s behavior , no matter how dishonest , extreme and anti-democratic it was .\nWell before Jan. 6 , Trump had thoroughly proven himself to be dangerous , inept at governing , corrupt and demagogic .\nIn one of my first columns for Press Watch , in October 2019 , I wrote that the main storyline of the 2020 election should be that we made a terrible mistake in 2016 and we need to fix it .\nThen , a year ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s degradation burst into public view .\nFor a day or two , even the most unflappable journalists had no alternative but to acknowledge he had crossed a line .\nIt had happened \u2013 undeniably \u2014 right in front of everyone \u2019 s eyes .\n\u2018 \u201c Trump Incites Mob \u201d proclaimed the New York Times banner headline the next morning .\nThe storming of the Capitol by Trump supporters \u201c amounted to an attempted coup that they hoped would overturn the election he lost , \u201d wrote the Washington Post .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump has wrought \u2014 a mob as heedless of law and norms as he has been , willing to literally trash the fundamental institutions of American democracy , \u201d wrote the Los Angeles Times .\nBut within a few days , this sense of journalistic outrage had somehow been quenched .\nThat \u2019 s not to say that the coverage of the Republican Party since then has been what you would call positive .\nThese days , reporters will state without hesitation that the GOP accepts as an article of faith something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to steal the election .\nThey \u2019 ll note that Republicans are literally killing themselves rather than trust scientists .\nSometimes \u2013 rarely \u2014 they \u2019 ll even write that \u201c threats of violence are becoming commonplace among a significant segment of the Republican Party \u201d ; or that the GOP has allied with right-wing militias ; or that the party spreads hate speech .\nIn a particularly terrifying Dec. 30 article , the Associated Press \u2019 s Nicholas Riccardi wrote plainly that \u201c Trump-aligned Republicans \u201d are working to \u201c clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But our elite media can \u2019 t bring itself to say what kind of party that is , They won \u2019 t describe it as , say , dangerously delusional , or anti-democratic , or nativist , or know-nothing , or fascist .\nThey won \u2019 t say that the party has crossed the line \u2014 and hold it accountable for doing so .\nWith the notable exception of that AP story mentioned above , mainstream news coverage of the various Republican election moves \u2014 to restrict voting , put loyalists in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for partisans to overturn legitimate voting results \u2014 has fallen dramatically short of stating the obvious conclusion : that the party is preparing to steal future elections .\nConsider , for instance , this shockingly understated New York Times explainer about \u201c Voting Rights and the Battle Over Elections : What to Know.\n\u201d While full of solid information , it nonetheless casts the \u201c battle over voting rights \u201d as taking place on a \u201c partisan battlefield.\n\u201d But it \u2019 s not Democrats vs. Republicans here .\nMost accountability failures these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stem from a failure of journalists to pursue consequences for lying .\nAs I wrote last year , in my column on What the next generation of editors need to tell their political reporters , reporters should demand retractions from liars , publicly and repeatedly .\nThey should deny serial liars the opportunity to use the media to spread their lies .\nWhen forced to quote liars , they should warn readers .\nThey should overtly distinguish between people who , whatever their political views , have established a record of acting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This should be a top priority for reporters and editors and publishers .\nIn a world with no consequences for lying , fact-based journalism has little value .\nThe journalism profession failed to confront the Bush-Cheney regime for its lies \u2013 lies about going war and lies to cover up the lies about the war , lies about torture and surveillance , lies about Valerie Plame , Dick Cheney \u2019 s lies ( criminally prosecutable but for his chief of staff Scooter Libby \u2019 s lies ) .\nIs it so surprising that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a new extreme \u2013 not necessarily in terms of severity , but certainly in terms of volume ?\nThese days , the Big Lie is at the heart of the anti-democratic movement .\nBut the Big Lie isn \u2019 t just a lie , it \u2019 s also a promise .\nAnd without consequences , it becomes a reality .\nThere are , unfortunately , countless ways that mainstream news reporters fail to hold the Republican Party accountable .\nAmong them : \u2022 They write with justified horror about the anti-vaccine movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican officials and Fox News are intentionally and unforgivably using the issue to incite their base .\n\u2022 They describe the GOP \u2019 s appeals to racism and its manufacturing of white panic as clever politics .\n\u2022 They let Republican leaders take credit for solving crises they themselves created .\n\u2022 They don \u2019 t press Republicans to describe what they would actually do if they were in charge .\n\u2022 They decry polarization without stating who \u2019 s at fault .\n\u2022 They fail to confront , condemn and punish Fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreading lies and inciting conspiracy theorists .\n\u2022 They normalize and almost totally overlook the constant Republican obstruction of any progress toward better health care , preventing climate change , reducing inequality , and so on \u2014 only rarely noting the enormous human costs .\nInstead , they focus obsessively on Democratic squabbling .\nSome accountability failures have continued into the Biden presidency .\nFor instance , it \u2019 s been clear since the dawn of Covid that omnipresent testing was a necessity .\nReporters should have been clamoring for that during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year as well .\nAnd while it \u2019 s really great that a congressional committee is collecting evidence about the Jan. 6 sacking of the Capitol , its pace is way too slow and the coverage too demure .\nWhy is any of this secret ?\nThis is not the kind of investigation that needs confidentiality ; quite the contrary .\nReporters should be constantly demanding that congressional investigators tell them more of what they \u2019 re digging up , and they should follow up themselves , including by relentlessly hounding the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Times reported on Tuesday that the committee is \u201c rushing to make as much progress as possible before January 2023 \u201d because \u201c Republicans are favored to regain control of the House this fall , and if they do , that is when they would take power and almost certainly dissolve the inquiry.\n\u201d That \u2019 s not rushing .\nAnd it \u2019 s obviously not fast enough .\nTelevised hearings \u2013 hopefully starting soon \u2013 will be a good start .\nBut the most important stuff may not be televised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set for summer is not nearly fast enough .\nIt \u2019 s long been clear that , after Trump , there would be a huge need for reform \u2014 that Congress , civil society , and the executive branch itself would have to take steps to address the huge flaws in the American political system Trump exposed and exploited .\nA huge number of Trump actions need to be condemned , rescinded , and even more explicitly outlawed .\nWhy isn \u2019 t that happening ?\nWho is pushing for reforms , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial questions reporters should be demanding answers to every day .\nHere , for instance , is one blueprint , from the ethics watchdog group CREW , on one essential element of what should be a massive reform movement : Holding Presidents Accountable .\nIt calls for \u201c more robust methods \u201d to force presidents to release their tax returns and divest from their business , to enforce the Emoluments Clauses , to prevent abuse of the pardon power , and more .\nOr consider the need to revisit just one of Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflammatory , unprecedented and flatly illegal drone-strike assassination of Iranian General Qassim Suleimani in Iraq in January 2020 .\nPress coverage at the time was credulous and na\u00efve .\nBut as Brian Finucane , a former State Department legal advisor , recently wrote for Just Security , a \u201c set of extreme legal opinions drafted during the Trump administration to justify the president \u2019 s actions\u2026 now lie ready to be used by future presidents , \u201d and must be disavowed and rescinded .\nRepeatedly calling out the Republican Party as unfit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds awfully partisan .\nBut wanting to hold the powerful accountable is hardly an endorsement of the Democratic Party .\nIn fact , outside of the media , one of the biggest reasons for the low expectations of accountability for government officials is the precedent set by Barack Obama , when he refused to hold anyone accountable for the Bush-Cheney administration \u2019 s torture of detainees .\nNot demanding some form of justice or recrimination from a president , vice president , on down \u2013 the people who proposed , approved , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings \u2013 was one of the most disappointing things ever for those of us who consider ourselves accountability journalists .\nIt \u2019 s not too late for genuine accountability journalism to make a difference , although it may be , soon .\nThe most urgent issue of the moment is protecting the country from ongoing assaults on the election process by the Republican Party that truly threaten to establish permanent minority rule .\nAs Mother Jones CEO Monika Bauerlein wrote in December , \u201c It \u2019 s the story that journalists should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from every angle , every day.\n\u201d As Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan wrote this week , \u201c For the most part , news organizations are not making democracy-under-siege a central focus of the work they present to the public\u2026 it doesn \u2019 t appear to be part of an overall editorial plan that fully recognizes just how much trouble we \u2019 re in .\nThat must change.\n\u201d Yes , shout it from the rooftops .\nOur country \u2019 s future depends on it .", "author": "Dan Froomkin", "url": "https://presswatchers.org/2022/01/accountability-jan-6-republicans-media-criticism/", "published":

major newsrooms .\nWhat did they see in it ?\nAnd what did that reveal about them ?\nNews organizations have personalities and politics , whether they admit it or not .\n( They don \u2019 t . )\nIt \u2019 s in coverage like this that their natural impulses are easiest to divine .\nFaced with a combination of positive and negative indicators , what do they reflexively focus on ?\nWhat the evidence below suggests is that newsrooms that tend to see everything as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times and the Washington Post \u2014 were more likely to focus on the negative elements of the jobs report .\nThe addition of 199,000 jobs in December was disappointing , they concluded .\nThose newsrooms consistently link President Biden \u2019 s re-election hopes to the health of the economy , so one could argue that stressing negative news about the economy reflects either a need to put a negative spin on everything \u2014 or some sort of latent anti-Biden bias .\nBiden himself said on Friday that the report marked a \u201c historic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and credited it in part to his American Rescue Plan and widespread distribution of the Covid vaccines .\n\u201c This is the kind of recovery I promised and hoped for for the American people , \u201d he said .\nAnd many other newsrooms saw the report , with its record low unemployment numbers , as hugely positive .\nNewsrooms serving the business community in particular saw it as signifying a booming recovery .\nHeadline : U.S. economy added just 199,000 jobs in December , before labor market confronted omicron surge The headline and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEli Rosenberg described the report as \u201c capping the year off with two straight months of disappointing levels of growth.\n\u201d The story was \u201c updated \u201d in the afternoon , to recast the report as containing \u201c confusing signals \u201d \u2013 but that only makes my point stronger : That the initial urge was to be negative .\nThe later version also included a pretty ironic quote from Augustine Faucher , chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group , who said \u201c We have a weak headline number but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version concluded with this paragraph : Headline : The U.S. added 199,000 jobs in December as employers struggled to find workers .\nThe article by Sydney Ember and Jeanna Smialek started out with a graphic titled \u201c Another month of slow job gains.\n\u201d But after the first two paragraphs , Ember and Smialek basically stopped to explain that it \u2019 s not really dire at all : Slower hiring numbers like these ordinarily reflect decreased demand \u2014 which would be a sign of legitimate concern \u2014 but in light of the low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they more likely reflect a shortage in the labor supply , which is not a bad thing at all ( especially if you \u2019 re part of the labor supply ) .\nSo why emphasize the negative in the headline and lead ?\nMy answer : newsroom personality disorder .\nI think that also explains the following paragraph .\n( I \u2019 m not sure exactly what it means , but I think it \u2019 s suggestive of bad optics for Biden if numbers like these continue . )\nHeadline : US unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people find jobs So here \u2019 s a totally different take , which I would argue is both a truer reading of the data and a much more edifying story for the readers .\nChristopher Rugaber wrote : Rugaber noted the possible disruptions ahead on account of the spike in Covid cases .\nBut then he added a story about a real person : Patrick Freeman , a custodian at a furniture factory in North Carolina , who in late November got a permanent job and a 33 percent pay increase after having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apparently , more employers are shifting employees from temporary to permanent status , in order to keep them .\nThat sounds like good news .\nSarah Chaney Cambon \u2019 s article in the Journal was shockingly optimistic : Lucia Mutikani looked at the big picture and saw progress toward something previously considered almost unattainable : Fox \u2019 s propaganda and disinformation channel had former Trump economic adviser Stephen Moore on , describing what he called \u201c the disappearance of the American worker \u201d .\nNPR \u2019 s Scott Horsley focused mostly on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty significant downshift in the pace of hiring , \u201d he reported .\nNPR \u2019 s twitter feed once again jumped to emphasize the worst : But that wasn \u2019 t nearly as bad as last month \u2019 s tweet : Pressrun author Eric Boehlert cited that December tweet as evidence that the \u201c press remains committed to running down Biden economy.\n\u201d Boehlert has repeatedly pointed out that many news outlets \u201c stress discouraging news regarding the Biden economy , while often ignoring or downplaying the cascading positive developments.\n\u201d Headline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % giving Fed room to raise rates It was all

Strom Thurmond of South Carolina eventually came to support the Voting Rights Act .\n( It was in 1982 ; Biden was a co-sponsor . )\n\u201c Not a single Republican has displayed the courage to stand up to a defeated president to protect America \u2019 s right to vote .\nNot one.\n\u201d But almost the entire focus of the immediate media coverage was on whether his plea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills passed would be heeded by all the senators from his party .\nEven before he gave his speech , the New York Times had concluded the answer was almost certainly no .\nAs in the Washington Post \u2018 s initial story , discussion of the actual stakes was limited to a few throwaway sentences .\nIt \u2019 s been like this all along .\nWhen Carl Hulse and Emily Cochrane reported for the New York Times on Jan. 3 that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had set a Jan. 17 deadline for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they included all of 13 words about the Freedom to Vote Act and 16 on the John Lewis bill .\nWhen Biden denounced Trump on Jan. 6 as a threat to the constitutional order , his forward-looking message was that the right response to the GOP effort to defy the will of the voters is to make sure that every citizen \u2019 s vote is cast , counted , and respected .\nBut Michael Scherer , reporting on the story for the Washington Post , didn \u2019 t mention the bills at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Times , \u201c Voting Rights and the Battle Over Elections : What to Know , \u201d included one dismissive paragraph about the bills , calling them \u201c sweeping , \u201d but describing them as pretty much doomed .\nSo by the Times \u2019 s reckoning , \u201c what to know \u201d doesn \u2019 t include bupkus about the bills .\nMeanwhile , the newsletter crowd couldn \u2019 t care less about the legislation itself , they just want to know : \u201c Will Biden make a more forceful case for reforming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain citizens looking for a good overview should start with a recent Washington Post opinion piece by two of the city \u2019 s good-government giants , Fred Wertheimer and Norman Eisen .\nTheir news peg was a transparent Republican attempt to derail the two big bills by backing a smaller \u2013 and for the moment , irrelevant \u2013 one .\nBut Wertheimer and Eisen offered a wonderful and easy-to-understand explanation of what \u2019 s actually in the Freedom to Vote bill , a stripped-down but still ambitious version of H.R .\n1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , they wrote , the act \u201c takes aim at the election hijacking going on in so many Republican-controlled states \u201d : Last year , 262 bills introduced in 41 states would award undue power to state legislatures or hyperpartisan actors to interfere with election administration ; 32 of them are now law in 17 states .\nThe measures introduced or passed do things such as intimidate election officials by allowing bogus \u201c audits \u201d of nonexistent fraud , criminalize routine election administration and allow legislatures to replace election boards that refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst-case scenario , some proposals permit the state legislature to determine who won an election , irrespective of the voters \u2019 choice\u2026 .\nIn Florida , for example , the Freedom to Vote Act ( FTVA ) , which Senate Democrats have sponsored , would make moot a new law that institutes onerous ID requirements to even request a mail-in ballot .\nSuch requirements disproportionately affect voters of color .\nIn Texas , the bill would preempt a blanket ban on ballot drop boxes , which are essential for densely populated , heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation would counter a new provision that outlaws giving food and water to voters waiting in line ; such lines are most common in counties like Fulton , DeKalb and Cobb , where voters of color predominate\u2026 .\nThe FTVA mandates that states use paper ballots for voting for federal office , creating an indisputable record of the vote in case a state legislature attempts to question the results via a phony audit .\nThe bill would protect election officials from dismissal without cause .\nIt would recognize a federal right to vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be challenged in court , subjecting state-level election processes to federal judicial scrutiny and allowing redress against individuals or legislatures that attempt to subvert the duly exercised will of the people .\nThe Brennan Center for Justice offers absolutely essential fact sheets on both the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act .\nProvisions of the former include : \u2022 Requiring all 50 states to offer early voting periods for at least two weeks prior to Election Day , including on nights and weekends .\n\u2022 Establishing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for every eligible voter .\n\u2022 Making Election Day a legal public holiday , making it easier for voters to get to the polls .\n\u2022 Creating a less onerous national standard for states that have voter ID requirements .\n\u2022 Restoring federal voting rights to formerly incarcerated citizens upon their release .\n\u2022 Increasing protections for local election administrators from being removed for partisan or political reasons .\n\u2022 Curbing \u201c dark money \u201d in federal elections by requiring any entity that spends more than $ 10,000 in an election to disclose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ?\nThat \u2019 s kind of an amazing list , am I right ?\nAnd there \u2019 s more .\nAs for the John Lewis bill , it doesn \u2019 t simply restore the crucial Voting Rights Act provisions struck down by the John Roberts Supreme Court in 2013 , it expands and modernizes them .\nAs the Brennan Center explains , it includes a new formula for establishing which \u201c jurisdictions with a history of voting discrimination must get approval from the Department of Justice or a federal court in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws or practices to ensure the changes are not discriminatory.\n\u201d It also requires federal approval nationwide for some types of particularly discriminatory voting changes .\nThose include creating at-large districts in places with sufficiently large minority populations , changing boundaries to dilute minority votes , or reducing access to multilingual voting materials .\nIt would also make it easier for voters to successfully sue to block discriminatory voting laws , and protect the right of Native Americans to vote .\nInstead of making it impossible for readers and viewers to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporters should make it impossible for them to miss it .\nThat includes publishing explainers on each bill , and then putting more than a few words about the bills in each story .\nSome news sites did explain what \u2019 s in the bills when they were introduced and then never again .\nThe Times \u2019 s Nicholas Fandos , for instance , wrote up the unveiling of the John Lewis bill in August .\nFor online news sites , the answer is painfully obvious : After publishing an introduction or explainers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those pieces omnipresent on your incremental coverage .\nAllow me a personal anecdote : The ability to provide deep context with a click was what attracted me to online news in the first place \u2014 in 1996 .\nWorking on the washingtonpost.com website in the late 1990s , my main task was to supplement the newsroom \u2019 s coverage of major political issues with primers and FAQs , timelines and key stories .\nSee , for instance , our very dated \u201c special reports \u201d on Social Security , tax policy , affirmative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awfully labor intensive \u2013 although they paid off in cumulative page views and in telegraphing to readers the depth of the material available on the website .\nNow , just adding one link would be an improvement , and that \u2019 s not so hard .\nThe pressure in political journalism to create clickbait , cover the horserace , and get scoops \u2013 all of those work against the interests of the reader or viewer who wants to be an informed citizen .\nDemocrats may take extraordinary steps to get these two bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a few baby steps toward helping Americans understand why .",

percent among Democrats , too .\nOver half of Americans also consider it very likely ( 19 percent ) or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be another attack in the United States like the one at the U.S. Capitol on January 6 , 2021 .\nAnd while people who follow me on Twitter are hardly a representative group , I was struck by how many people responded to this tweet by telling me that not only are they terrified , but that everybody they know is terrified , too .\nI don \u2019 t read about people who feel that way in the news , though .\nA growing number of pundits are trying to sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up being quoted in news stories .\nBut that \u2019 s not the same as a cultural trend piece that takes the temperature of a population .\nIt \u2019 s all highly reminiscent of what amounted to a near-boycott of Biden-supporter coverage before the 2020 election .\nNew York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie wrote in July 2019 that \u201c anti-Trump voters are practically invisible in recent mainstream political coverage \u201d \u2013 even though they represented the majority of Americans .\nIt didn \u2019 t get any better in the ensuing 16 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every run-up to war in our history : the supposed \u201c left \u201d gets ignored .\nAnd it \u2019 s true again .\nWhere are the voices of the ordinary people who fear for democracy ?\nWhy has the majority been silenced ?\nWe continue to get breathless reports from the Trump rallies .\nWhat about talking to non-racist parents who worry their children will be taught propaganda at school ?\nOr people in Black or brown communities who worry about barriers to voting , increased poverty and more militant policing ?\nOr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t want to see their neighbors deported ?\nOr trans people , who would have reason to

jaded , self-satisfied national political reporters could even benefit from talking to journalism colleagues in other departments .\nI have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , editors , and publishers are worried about bogus prosecutions , harassment , and punishment of journalists perceived to be disloyal .\nOur entire industry should worry that even more extreme Trumpian bombast about fake news and the enemy of the people could well become rallying cries for armed militias .\nWhat I asked on Twitter on Monday was this : Has anyone seen any good articles on people who are truly terrified that we may well be headed to white nationalist authoritarianism ?\nNo one had a good example .\nThere were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat to democracy written by experts .\nBut none about ordinary people feeling scared .\nNevertheless , some of the responses to my tweet blew me away .\nThe frustration was overwhelming .\nQuite a few people volunteered to be interviewed .\nThe public needs to hear about ordinary

Wednesday why he has failed to unite the country , President Biden took a foray into political science and media criticism , identifying the Republican Party \u2019 s lockstep fealty to the former guy as his biggest obstacle , along with the difficulty Americans have \u201c trying to sift their way through what \u2019 s real and what \u2019 s fake.\n\u201d \u201c I \u2019 ve never seen a time when the political coverage \u2014 the choice of what political coverage a voter looks to \u2014 has as much impact on as what they believe , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marathon press conference .\nFrom the outset , the press corps \u2019 agenda was clear .\nThe intent of the first two questions was to humble Biden and force him to admit error .\nThe first question : \u201c Did you overpromise to the American public what you could achieve in your first year in office ?\n\u201d The second : \u201c Do you need to be more realistic and scale down these priorities in order to get something passed ?\n\u201d But Biden , whose overall message was that he had \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking up , made it clear that the reason he hasn \u2019 t accomplished more was a Republican Party that \u201c will do anything to prevent my success.\n\u201d By contrast , the political press corps takes massive Republican obstruction for granted , and considers it un-newsworthy .\nBiden had predicted during his campaign that Republicans would be in a more compromising mood with him as president .\nInstead , he found Republican members of Congress even more devoted to blocking legislation than they had been during the Obama administration .\n\u201c I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be such a stalwart effort to make sure that the most important thing was that President Biden didn \u2019 t get anything done , \u201d he said .\nReporters consider that a \u201c gotcha , \u201d showing how na\u00efve Biden was .\nBut Biden made the case that , historically , at least some Republicans were open to working with a Democratic president .\n\u201c They weren \u2019 t nearly as obstructionist as they are now , \u201d he said .\nThese days , \u201c we don \u2019 t have a single Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names , but Biden insisted : Think about this , Biden said : Biden later added : \u201c I don \u2019 t know how we can \u2019 t look at what happened on January 6th and think , \u2018 That \u2019 s \u2014 that \u2019 s a problem .\nThat \u2019 s a real problem.\n\u2019 \u201d You could sense that Biden \u2019 s finger-pointing wasn \u2019 t going over very well with the reporters in attendance .\nAnd you could literally read how it was going over with their editors .\nRachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Washington Post and a former senior editor at Politico , tweeted early on : When the tweet went viral , the reaction was brutal .\nHere \u2019 s Norm Ornstein , a longtime political observer of note : In the second hour of the press conference , Biden was asked perhaps the most \u201c inside Washington \u201d question I \u2019 ve heard in a long time , by Yahoo News reporter Alexander Nazaryan : Q.\nThere \u2019 s an increasing concern , I think among some Democrats , that even if schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get that most of them are now open \u2014 Republicans will weaponize this narrative of you \u2014 of you and other leading Democrats allowing them to stay closed in the midterms next year and that \u2014 you know , obviously , that issue has a lot of traction with suburban parents , as I think you saw in Virginia \u2014 THE PRESIDENT : What do you mean \u201c allowing \u201d ?\nI \u2019 m confused by the question .\nI \u2019 m sorry .\nQ Well , that \u2014 could school reopenings or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans to win back the suburbs ?\nIn other words : What do you do when Republicans find themselves a very effective lie and go to town with it ?\nThat \u2019 s more a question for political journalists than for Biden .\nBut it elicited a fascinating , if rambling , response that included some astute press criticism .\nHe said voters \u201c get reinforced in their views , whether it \u2019 s MSNBC or whether it \u2019 s Fox or whatever.\n\u201d As a result , \u201c we have self-identified perspectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what cable you look at .\nAnd it \u2019 s \u2014 it \u2019 s never quite been like that.\n\u201d He talked about the public \u2019 s struggle to distinguish between what \u2019 s true and what \u2019 s not true .\nAnd he expressed optimism that voters will eventually distinguish between the two \u2013 something I have often said ought to be the top job for political journalists : Maybe I \u2019 m kidding myself , but as time goes on , the voter who is just trying to figure out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of their family , put three squares on the table , stay safe , able to pay their mortgage or their rent , et cetera , has \u2014 is becoming much more informed on the motives of some of the political players and some of the \u2014 and the political parties .\nAnd I think that they are not going to be as susceptible to believing some of the outlandish things that have been said and continue to be said .\nBiden \u2019 s biggest new talking point consisted of asking over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supports , rather than what it opposes .\nHe challenged the people in the room to answer : \u201c What are Republicans for ?\nWhat are they for ?\nName me one thing they \u2019 re for.\n\u201d As it happens , that \u2019 s something I \u2019 ve been encouraging reporters to dig into since December .\nSenate minority leader Mitch McConnell has made no secret of his belief that the best way for Republicans to win back Congress in the 2022 midterms is to not tell voters what they stand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday . )\nI think if Republicans themselves won \u2019 t tell the voters their plans , then it \u2019 s incumbent on political journalists to do so \u2013 assuming there are plans at all .\nThere are a number of dangers facing the country \u2014 some of them downright existential \u2014 and Biden is right that there are no clear affirmative positions from Republicans about how they would face them .\nThere were several solid and important \u2013 if sometimes goading \u2014 questions from the assembled press corps about the tense situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you factor out the ludicrous questions from right-wing disinformation outlets \u2014 the mainstream political reporters once again seemed out of touch with the times , overly focused on getting Biden to admit he \u2019 s a failure , rather than on how we solve the many problems ahead .", "author": "Dan Froomkin", "url": "https://presswatchers.org/2022/01/reporters-blame-biden-for-not-uniting-the-country-biden-blames-trump-and-fox/", "published": "Thu, 20 Jan 2022 17:19:04

probably don \u2019 t even know about it .\nIt \u2019 s called \u201c Democracy in Peril , \u201d on CNN at 9 p.m. And \u2013 possibly alone in the corporate media universe \u2013 it is exactly the right way for a news organization to acknowledge and cover the biggest , most dangerous political story in America .\nFor me , it \u2019 s literally a wish come true .\nAfter Chris Cuomo was banished from that time slot in early December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what or who should replace him .\nLast week \u2013 its first \u2013 \u201c Democracy in Peril \u201d was anchored by Brianna Keilar , whose tough , plain-spoken style has made her a champion of fighting disinformation and calling out Fox \u2019 s propaganda network .\nThis week , the anchor will be Jim Acosta , who has also become increasingly blunt in calling out lies about the 2020 election results and the vaccine .\nHe recently dubbed Trump the \u201c Lord of the Lies.\n\u201d CNN is mum about how much longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under what circumstances , but one can hope it will stick around at least until democracy is safe again .\nLast week \u2019 s shows were excellent , featuring Keilar \u2019 s solid introductions , one reported story per night , and a strong , distinct theme running through each episode .\nEvidently the show is getting pretty weak ratings , even by CNN standards .\nBut who even knows it exists ?\nI get the feeling that CNN is treating it like a place-holder until something better comes up .\nNothing will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watch it .\nTell your friends .\nWhat You Missed So Far Keilar started the first show off with a bang .\nThere was no both-sidesing , no false equivalence : CNN correspondent Donie O \u2019 Sullivan contributed a report from Arizona , describing the battle lines \u201c for the future of American democracy \u201d by speaking to members of the Martin Luther King Jr. family and people attending a Trump rally .\nO \u2019 Sullivan explained : We started off , Saturday morning , at that march with the King family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , a voter , in Arizona .\nAnd for her , the fear is real .\nWhat she is seeing , it is based in history .\nIt \u2019 s echoes of Jim Crow , what they \u2019 re seeing with these restrictions that are being brought in now .\nOn the other side of things , there are people , at the Trump rally , who are fearful .\nI think , some of them know better \u2013 some of them know that this is a lie , and it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a talking point .\nBut a lot of them really have been bought so far into this world of conspiracy , that they genuinely do believe that American democracy is a joke .\nAnd it \u2019 s a very , very sad place , for an American , to be , in that mindset , particularly because of lies .\nKeilar also spoke with retired Major General Paul D. Eaton and retired Brigadier General Steven M. Anderson \u2013 two of the three retired generals who wrote in the Washington Post last month expressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a future insurrection .\nOn \u201c Democracy in Peril , \u201d Anderson \u2019 s shared his advice to active-duty troops : \u201c Stop listening to the pillow guy and start paying attention to what our democracy really is.\n\u201d And CNN analyst John Avlon contributed a very useful modern civics lesson .\nHe described the \u201c incentive structures in our politics \u201d as screwed up and leading to increased polarization .\nHe made no bones about saying \u201c this is asymmetric polarization \u201d .\nAnd he talked about the rise of \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of background that is so often left out of political journalism because it \u2019 s assumed people know it already .\nTuesday \u2019 s show was devoted to \u201c disinformation , and the way that it is poisoning the well , of the American experiment.\n\u201d CNN correspondent Sara Murray filed a report on Douglas Frank , an Ohio math teacher who is now \u201c traveling the country and spreading election lies to big crowds , \u201d backed by MyPillow CEO , Mike Lindell .\nKeilar eventually spent about 20 minutes relentlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t discuss , the tsunami of disinformation , jeopardizing American democracy , without talking about the mothership , Fox .\nI don \u2019 t call it news , even if they do , because it \u2019 s not news , \u201d she said .\nShe played clips from Tucker Carlson , Laura Ingraham , and Sean Hannity , and refuted them .\nThat was great stuff , and more media figures need to follow her example .\nWednesday \u2019 s show focused on voter suppression , including a report from Georgia , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relentless Republican campaign to undermine , harass , and replace non-partisan election board members was the main topic of Friday \u2019 s show Rick Hasen , an election law expert who teaches at the University of California , Irvine , offered a dose of common sense and alarm , pointing out that \u201c a baseline idea of how you run a democracy is that you can fairly count the votes .\nAnd if that \u2019 s what we \u2019 re struggling with ?\nWe \u2019 ve got problems , even bigger than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve been talking about , for many years.\n\u201d CNN correspondent Kyung Lah contributed a powerful report based on talking to election workers about how scary their jobs have become .\nThere \u2019 s certainly room for improvement in \u201c Democracy in Peril.\n\u201d My biggest complaint is that it feels too much like any other news show on CNN when I would prefer a more distinctive style and a more palpable sense of urgency \u2013 like Nightline had .\nAs with everything else on CNN , the show depends way too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-the-ground reporting , presumably because the latter is so much more expensive .\nI \u2019 d like to see ordinary citizens who are , for the first time in their lives , terrified about an authoritarian takeover should Republicans win in 2022 and 2024 .\nAnd I \u2019 d like to see taped interviews with Stop-the-Steal advocates that go beyond their inane talking points and instead question them about where they get their news ; try to figure out why they were so susceptible to lies ; challenge their assumptions ; confront them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most people think they \u2019 re nuts .\nBut the first order of business is getting enough people to watch it that CNN keeps it going .\n\u201c I hope CNN makes it a regular part of its line-up , \u201d Democracy Docket founder Marc

Stephen Breyer \u2019 s emptying seat on the Supreme Court has freaked out right-wing media , sending the likes of Tucker Carlson and Larry Kudlow into torrential rants of racist and misogynistic froth and whiny white grievance .\nThat \u2019 s not really so shocking .\nIt \u2019 s laughable , ironic , and pathetic , given how 108 of the 115 people who have served on the Court have been white guys , and how overdue such a nomination is .\nBut what is shocking is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a serious , debatable proposition the view that Black women have been overrepresented in Biden \u2019 s judicial nominations .\nThe Times article by Michael D. Shear and Charlie Savage focused on how Biden \u2019 s promise \u201c underscores how much Black women have struggled to become part of a very small pool of elite judges in the nation \u2019 s higher federal courts.\n\u201d But Shear and Savage then went on to respectfully relate the argument that there is something off about Biden \u2019 s attempt to fix that .\nThey wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from across the ideological spectrum , \u201d they quoted a seriously compromised Republican operative : Steve Vladeck , the prolific and perspicacious University of Texas law professor , was quick off the mark Wednesday night to call out the Times : Others on Twitter also criticized the Times for quoting Whelan \u2014 and compounding their mistake by not explaining who he is .\nWhelan , after all , is the guy who was forced to apologize and take a leave from the think tank he runs after he peddled a conspiracy theory on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign to cast doubt on the veracity of a sexual assault allegation against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh .\nBy contrast to the Times , the Washington Post focused on how the appointment would be \u201c a milestone in the country \u2019 s history.\n\u201d Seung Min Kim and Ann E. Marimow quoted Democratic Sen. Patty Murray saying \u201c The court should reflect the diversity of our country , and it is unacceptable that we have never in our nation \u2019 s history had a Black woman sit on the Supreme Court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Black woman Supreme Court justice is eliciting a particularly visceral response from right-wing media , raising two questions that political journalists should really address : \u2022 Why are they so freaked out exactly ?\n( Hint : Black .\nWoman . )\n\u2022 Is there no limit to the racism and misogyny that can be expressed on Fox and elsewhere without negative consequences ?\n( Although , sadly , their open embrace of replacement theory indicates the answer is no . )\nTucker Carlson , as HuffPost reported , spent \u201c 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s vow to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court.\n\u201d He mocked Biden for not picking a Pacific Islander or a trans woman instead .\nAnd in a classic example of projection , Carlson said Not much later , he illustrated my point exactly : He put this photo up on the screen .\nLarry Kudlow was outraged .\n\u201c I am offended by President Biden \u2019 s woke promise to appoint an African-American female , \u201d he said .\nHe had an alternative proposition : \u201c that Joe Biden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including white people .\nThat \u2019 s right , white people.\n\u201d This was followed by a sound bite from Martin

Hannity went on the attack .\nAnd Maria Bartiromo seriously insisted that \u201c speculation \u201d was \u201c rising \u201d that Biden would pick Kamala Harris and maybe nominate Hillary Clinton as vice president .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuts .\nLucky for us , we have people like Elie Mystal and Nicole Hannah-Jones to put the racist , sexist right-wing meltdown into context .\nThey \u2019 ve been on a roll on Twitter and TV .\nA tiny sample : I worry about how this story will be reported on by our corporate media because it touches on some issues that it typically avoids , elides , or screws up .\nThis nomination ought to spur all sorts of important discussions \u2013 about racial justice in general , but also specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notion that Biden is trying to fix something that remains broken .\nI mean , you sometimes do need to redress historical wrongs .\nYou do need to acknowledge the past , and how it continues to influence the present .\nThose are not crazy ideas .\nBut our elite newsrooms just aren \u2019 t comfortable going there .\nYou could see that in their resistance to addressing the actual substance of critical race theory \u2013 while gleefully reporting about how clever it is for Republicans to demonize it .\nThe substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens , is highly relevant to the nomination of a Black woman justice , as Nikole Hannah-Jones explained : Similarly , coverage of the Supreme Court \u2019 s decision to reopen the debate about affirmative action has avoided the central issue of racial justice , focusing instead on whether \u201c diversity \u201d justifies giving some preferences to under-represented groups .\nRobert Barnes and Nick Anderson of the Washington Post were far from alone in framing the issue as one of \u201c whether universities may consider the race of applicants when trying to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a lot of the arguing is about , but it \u2019 s important to remember that affirmative action ( as I wrote in a 1998 primer for the Washington Post ) was born of the civil rights movement , and is the nation \u2019 s most ambitious attempt to redress its long history of racial and sexual discrimination .\nIt \u2019 s still needed because the playing field is not level yet .\nGranting modest advantages to minorities and women is more than fair , given hundreds of years of discrimination that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big newsrooms don \u2019 t like to address the playing field issue anymore \u2013 something most vividly illustrated by the one exception to the rule : the epic 2014 Atlantic essay by Ta-Nehisi Coates , making the case for reparations .\n\u201c America was built on the preferential treatment of white people\u2014395 years of it .\nVaguely endorsing a cuddly , feel-good diversity does very little to

"title": "Gaslighting in the news pages of the New York Times", "content": "In her first major article on her new beat , New York Times congressional reporter Annie Karni made a striking assertion that bears no connection to reality .\nRepublicans , she wrote , \u201c have been intent on rehabilitating themselves in the eyes of voters after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol last year.\n\u201d It \u2019 s certainly true that Republicans are intent on winning in 2022 and beyond .\nBut the notion that they are trying to rehabilitate themselves in any way \u2013 something that typically involves recognition of a problem followed by efforts to change \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what \u2019 s going on in the New York Times Washington bureau .\nEven though she assured readers that this was true of \u201c Republicans \u201d as a whole , Karni \u2014 who recently shifted over from the White House beat \u2014 was of course unable to cite even one example in support of her conclusion .\nThe fact is there has been no lasting remorse from the party \u2019 s leaders and its base , whether about the violent sacking of the Capitol , the Big Lie , or really any element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election .\nThey haven \u2019 t even promised not to do it again .\nQuite the opposite : they \u2019 re openly preparing to steal future elections \u2014 both before the fact , through voter suppression and gerrymandering , and after , by controlling the counting of the ballots and the certification of the results .\nThe Times itself has reported on that quite thoroughly .\nSo why would a Times reporter make such an absurd assertion ?\nI have to think that it \u2019 s because in the Times Washington bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d has created enormous pressure to behave as if there remain two more-or-less equally reasonable political parties in this country .\nThat inevitably requires a great deal of journalist contortion \u2014 some of it back-breaking .\nMost crucially , it requires Times reporters to believe that Trump , Trumpism , and the Jan. 6 insurrection were just an aberration , and not emblematic of the real Republican Party .\nAs it happens , that \u2019 s a view shared almost exclusively with the Republicans that the Times journalists talk to the most : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this point are out of power , unless they publicly kowtow to Trump .\nOverall , Karni \u2019 s article correctly noted how delighted Republicans are with Biden \u2019 s failures , and how they appear to be poised to take over Congress in 2022 , despite the party \u2019 s lurch toward extremism .\nBut her solid points were utterly undermined by her fantasy \u2013 and a whole lot of generalizing .\nIt \u2019 s all right there in the headline and subhead : \u201c Republicans Relish Biden \u2019 s Troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The president \u2019 s woes have delighted Republicans , who have been seeking to rehabilitate themselves in the eyes of voters after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\u201d Consider the first two paragraphs : Notice how that second paragraph illustrates the Times \u2019 s sloppy , lazy , and often inaccurate practice of attributing views held by some members of a party to the party as a whole \u2014 without any kind of support or attribution .\nSo it \u2019 s \u201c Democrats \u201d who are calling for a \u201c major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans , who have been intent on rehabilitating themselves.\n\u201d In reality , that is certainly not true of all Democrats .\nAnd in this case , it \u2019 s not true of any Republicans \u2013 at least none who remain in the party \u2019 s good standing .\nAs for the word choice , let \u2019 s be absolutely clear : It is simply not the case that one can rehabilitate oneself ( in anyone \u2019 s eyes ) simply by saying the other guy is worse .\nThat may be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s not rehabilitation .\nAnd please tell me which Republicans are willing to acknowledge the party \u2019 s \u201c lurch toward extremism \u201d \u2014 not to mention worry about it .\nCertainly not the ones in charge .\nThe \u201c continuing rifts under the influence of former President Donald J. Trump \u201d are largely imaginary : The party operates in lockstep behind him .\nTo be fair , Karni \u2019 s \u201c rift \u201d rhetoric reflect Times orthodoxy that the real Republican Party is still out there , just waiting to return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday made a laughably weak case that \u201c Trump \u2019 s Grip on G.O.P .\nFaces New Strains.\n\u201d And if anything , those \u201c strains \u201d are coming from his right flank .\nBy contrast , in the real world , the evidence continues to mount that there is nothing Trump could say that would turn GOP party leaders against him \u2013 even the constitutional equivalent of shooting someone in the face on Fifth Avenue .\nTrump said just this past weekend that Vice President Mike Pence could and should have overturned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Melanie Zanona reported for CNN on Monday , Republican senators shrugged it off , reiterating that they would support him if he \u2019 s the Republican nominee in 2024 .\nFurther down in the story , Karni again lurches between fantasy and reality : And then , in case you were looking for signs of rehabilitation somewhere in the article , Karni actually establishes the opposite : Is this the closest the Times has come to noticing that the GOP either has no agenda or is hiding it from 2022 voters ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ offhand mention .\nEntirely missing from Karni \u2019 s story \u2013 and this is , again , typical of Times political coverage \u2013 was any mention of how the main cause of Biden \u2019 s failures has been chronic , lockstep Republican obstruction .\nThere \u2019 s no mention of the GOP \u2019 s role in consistently blocking any kind of positive response to existential issues like climate change or child poverty or racial justice .\nThere \u2019 s one mention of Covid \u2013 it \u2019 s about Biden \u2019 s \u201c unfulfilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus pandemic \u201d \u2014 but no mention at all of how a crazed right-wing campaign is crippling the government response .\nKarni \u2019 s article really seemed to touch a nerve on Twitter , even relative to other Times transgressions : As retired newspaper editor Pat Dougherty noted , the whole story is \u201c based on what Republicans are saying , not what they \u2019 re doing .\nTypical \u2018 insider , access \u2019 NYT political coverage .\nNot worth reading.\n\u201d In a fascinating back-and-forth with NYU journalism professor Jay Rosen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the article \u2019 s defense , insisting that Rosen and I were misreading it , and positing an alternate understanding of the word \u201c rehabilitate.\n\u201d Much of the debate is captured here .\n\u201c The piece is saying the Republicans are seeking to restore their rep in the eyes of voters by going hard on Biden \u2019 s polices without suggesting much of their own .\nSeems a pretty accurate observation to me , \u201d Lee wrote .\n\u201c The reporting doesn \u2019 t say they \u2019 re actually rehabilitating , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty deliberate language.\n\u201d Rosen responded : \u201c Rehabilitation is the path the GOP declined : when you know something \u2019 s broken , and you change it through the work of rebuilding and repair.\n\u201d My answer was : No .\nThe flatly absurd assertion that the Republican Party has grappled with its sordid past is a canonical example of the Times \u2019 s ongoing attempt to normalize the abnormal .\nAnd more urgently , it reflects a continuing failure to report ethically about the midterm elections .\nPlease consider reading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November.. My point was that reporters have established that the Republican Party has become anti-democracy , race-baiting , violence-inciting , shameless , and untethered to reality .\nYet they still handicap the midterms as if things were normal .\nIndeed , they calmly predict a Republican victory \u2014 as if it weren \u2019 t a major step toward white supremacist authoritarianism .\nFor thinking political reporters , this creates a sort of cognitive dissonance .\nAnd without competent editorial leadership , they end up producing journalism that makes no sense , doesn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .", "author": "Dan Froomkin", "url": "https://presswatchers.org/2022/02/gaslighting-in-the-news-pages-of-the-new-york-times/", "published": "Tue, 01 Feb 2022 17:37:12 +0000", "published_utc": 1643755032, "collection_utc": 1643759626}, {"id": "presswatchers--2022-02-02--Still just repeating whatever Trump says?

cable \u201c news \u201d business continues apace , the next incarnation of CNN could well make Zucker \u2019 s legacy of cheesy conflict look like great journalism in retrospect .\nBut there is another way .\nThere is a gaping emptiness in the American television news ecosphere that CNN is uniquely poised to fill .\nIt \u2019 s for a network that champions the truth as boldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disinformation .\nThat means not just delivering the news , but also helping people understand the real-world context in which the news occurs .\nIt means not just fact-checking disinformation spreaders like Fox , but unraveling their deceptions , examining their motives , and using vigorous reporting to contrast what they say with what is really happening on the ground .\nI could be \u201c Reality TV \u201d \u2013 not the kind with contrived skirmishes that Zucker championed , both before and during his tenure at CNN , but TV based on actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hearken back to CNN \u2019 s early days , when it didn \u2019 t have to worry about gimmicks because it was the only player , and it became the place to watch breaking news .\nIt proceeded to earn a reputation for straight-shooting , and its tagline , \u201c the most trusted name in news.\n\u201d The Need for Change CNN obviously needs to do something differently post Zucker .\nIts audience is drifting off .\nMore Democrats watch Fox than watch CNN .\nIt runs a fairly distant third in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far-right propaganda and entertainment make it the undisputed leader , and MSNBC , which has an overtly partisan Democratic bent .\nCNN also lost a higher percentage of its viewers in last year \u2019 s post-Trump slump than the other two networks , making things just that much worse .\nZucker \u2019 s foremost legacy at CNN was his devotion to goosing the ratings with fake drama from predictable pundits .\nHis most inexcusable act was to pay Trump loyalists to come on CNN to fight and lie .\nThat was the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s dilemma was a tough one .\nCNN \u2019 s format increasingly feels tired and flawed .\nAfter a certain point , how interesting is it to have the same people on TV saying the same things all the time ?\nNo one ever changes their mind .\nIt feels so disconnected from reality .\nOne way to add zing is with high-wattage personalities expressing strong feelings about the news .\nZucker tried that with the smug and belatedly-fired Chris Cuomo and the wonderfully sincere Don Lemon .\nBut MSNBC does it better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary fragmentation of the media \u2014 first by cable and then the Internet \u2014 has resulted in an anarchic news environment , where there \u2019 s no widespread agreement anymore on what is true or what is decent .\nWe suffer from not having a common frame of reference .\nThere is no Walter Cronkite serving as disseminator , gate-keeper , and voice of reason .\nSo , what if CNN \u2014 rather than try to groom individual personalities \u2014 instead took on one big personality of its own , network-wide : Cronkite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white patrician element . )\nImagine CNN as one big Cronkite telling you what you need to know , while at the same time full of righteous indignation toward the spreaders of disinformation and indecency .\nImagine a CNN constantly sending out the crews that it mobilizes for disasters \u2013 and more \u2013 to do ground-based reporting on the national challenges of the moment , rather than just asking well-heeled talking heads about them .\nIt seems particularly appropriate given that two key issues \u2014 the threat to democracy and the threat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if slower-moving than a hurricane .\nThis CNN would vigorously oppose disinformation as part of its daily routine , identifying the latest toxic deceptions and defanging them with actual reporting ; comparing what Fox says with reality .\nThe goal would not simply be to mock Fox , but to explain its motives , point out what it \u2019 s not asking or reporting , and perhaps most importantly , explore the impact of its lies on its viewers .\nRight now , unfortunately , that \u2019 s too easy : It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd mocking Fox does make good TV , too .\nCNN should show and contextualize the best and worst of Fox , so no reasonable person would feel the need to watch them any longer .\nWeaning people off Fox is both a good business model and good journalism .\nThis CNN would focus even more than they do now on bringing in experts to explain things as best they can , even if that makes the stories more complicated .\nI \u2019 d recommend more historians \u2014 and a lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values in the Zoom era has one huge advantage : CNN could bring on more regular people , from their homes , telling their own stories : teachers , community organizers , religious leaders , local officials , and just plain folks whose life experiences serve as a reality check .\nIt could feature , say , regular people who are terrified for our democracy .\nIt could bring on local news reporters and show local news reports , rather than feeling the need to parachute in everywhere .\nAs you may recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro-Trump zealots was to help viewers understand what the MAGA crowd is thinking .\nThat \u2019 s a noble goal .\nBut instead of hiring hucksters , I \u2019 d want to see CNN reporters sitting down with real MAGA believers , at length ( on tape ) , to learn about their core values , their news consumption , and their tribal affiliations .\nCNN could return to its Atlanta roots , shifting its focus to outside the Beltway .\nIt could devote broadcasts to specific issues , allowing for a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archived video of those broadcasts would make great context for incremental stories on the web site .\nAnd let \u2019 s not forget the CNN.com website , which feels a bit overlooked by management despite being \u2013 by far\u2014the top digital news website in the U.S. What a great place to focus attention on the topic of the day , accept submissions from readers , and seek out real stories of real people .\nFinally there \u2019 s a matter of talent .\nI \u2019 m with newsletter writer Parker Molloy , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sports \u2019 guys like Chris Cillizza \u201d and let \u2019 s hear even more from Jake Tapper , Andrew Kaczynski , and Donie O \u2019 Sullivan \u2013 \u201c just naming a few of the many CNN people who would benefit under a more news-centric focus.\n\u201d And What About the Ratings ?\nFor two weeks in January , CNN engaged in a wonderful experiment .\nIt turned the hour previously occupied by Chris Cuomo over to a show called \u201c Democracy in Peril , \u201d hosted first by Brianna Keilar and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was considerably better in concept then execution .\nI found it a bit too monotonal , to crimped by the same eye-glazing format , and although there was a reported segment each night , there was too much talking and too little showing .\nThen , despite the incredible , urgent topicality of the show \u2013 and my best efforts \u2014 the rating sucked .\nThey were so bad that Tucker Carlson mocked CNN , instead of the other way around .\nWhich leads to what is inevitably the most persuasive argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for CNN : that it won \u2019 t make money ; that entertainment is what the public increasingly wants from its \u201c news \u201d , not earnestness .\nI have no compelling answer to this argument , other than to hope that it could build a market , that civil society could help build that market , and that influencers could encourage people to tune in .\nAnd keep in mind that Cronkite reached nearly 30 million people a night \u2014 about 50 times what CNN gets right now

welcome surprise on Thursday to hear NPR \u2019 s Ayesha Rascoe push back when White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki asserted , without providing any evidence , that ISIS leader Hajji Abdullah had detonated a suicide vest during a special forces raid of his home in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign that at the State Department , AP reporter Matt Lee didn \u2019 t accept spokesman Ned Price \u2018 s assertion about an alleged Russian false-flag operation on face value .\nIt was grotesque that Psaki and Price both responded to being openly doubted by suggesting it was tantamount to believing ISIS or the Russians over the U.S. government .\n( Price at least had the grace to sort of apologize . )\nBut both of them were clearly caught off guard by reporters asking for evidence to back up their claims .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier that morning with two anonymous \u201c senior administration officials , \u201d in which reporters neither requested that the officials speak on the record , not raised any doubts . )\nSadly , from what I can tell , none of the skepticism expressed by Rascoe or Lee actually made it into the mainstream-media coverage of the story .\nThat remains a bridge too far , apparently \u2013 even coming only a few weeks after the New York Times brilliantly exposed the government \u2019 s initial story about a drone strike in Kabul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a lot of media chatter about Thursday \u2019 s back-and-forth , however , including a terrific panel discussion led by Jake Tapper on CNN in which he emphasized that \u201c U.S .\nintelligence and the Pentagon have not only gotten things wrong before , they have openly lied to the American people before.\n\u201d By contrast , he said , \u201c is it not the definition of patriotism for journalists to say , OK , the Pentagon or the intelligence community is saying this , prove it ?\nWhere \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials \u2013 especially when what they say is based on evidence they won \u2019 t share \u2013 is something the press corps needs to relearn over and over again , if they learn it at all .\nI.F .\nStone modeled a different way to go about reporting on things the government didn \u2019 t want known .\nIn her book , \u201c All Governments Lie !\n\u201c , biographer Myra MacPherson quoted longtime Washington reporter Marvin Kalb on Stone : \u201c He didn \u2019 t care what the \u2018 senior officials \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I think he assumed they were lying or misleading the press in any case.\n\u201d MacPherson also quoted Stone himself : \u201c You can not get intimate with officials and maintain your independence.\n\u201d Whether they were \u201c good guys \u201d or \u201c bad guys \u201d was incidental to him .\n\u201c They \u2019 ll use you.\n\u201d Back in 2007 , when George W. Bush was ratcheting up rhetoric against Iran , and I was deputy editor of the late , lamented NiemanWatchdog.org website , I wrote up a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Vietnam and then should have been learned from Iraq .\nThe fact is that when military action or intelligence are involved , there \u2019 s every reason for journalists to suspect they \u2019 re being misled \u2014 if not on purpose , then because your sources have been misled as well .\nHere \u2019 s an updated list of lessons from the past : \u2022 Don \u2019 t assume anything administration officials tell you is true .\nIn fact , you are probably better off assuming anything they tell you is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every assertion .\nAssume the proof is a lie .\nDemand that they prove that their proof is accurate .\n\u2022 Just because they say it , doesn \u2019 t mean it should make the headlines .\nThe absence of supporting evidence for their assertion \u2014 or a preponderance of evidence that contradicts the assertion \u2014 may be more newsworthy than the assertion itself .\n\u2022 Don \u2019 t print anonymous assertions .\nDemand that sources identify themselves so that they can be held accountable .\n\u2022 Don \u2019 t assume that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence , know more than you do .\n\u2022 Alternately , assume that they do indeed know more than you do \u2013 and are trying to keep intelligence that would undermine their arguments secret .\n\u2022 Don \u2019 t privilege official statements over what witnesses on the ground said they saw and heard \u2013 in fact , quite the opposite .\nTime and again , the latter have proven to be more accurate .\n( A few canonical examples here and here . )\n\u2022 Give voice to the skeptics ; don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listen to and quote the people who got it right last time : The intelligence officials , state department officials , war-college instructors and many others who have been vindicated in the past .\n\u2022 Offer the greatest and most guaranteed degree of confidentiality to whistleblowers offering information that contradicts the official government position .\n( By contrast , don \u2019 t offer any confidentiality to administration spinners . )\nThe full quote from Stone actually goes : \u201c All governments lie , but disaster lies in wait for countries whose officials smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So Tapper is exactly right : Journalists are doing their patriotic duty when they demand to see the evidence .", "author": "Dan Froomkin", "url":

want to live in?\u2019", "content": "Quite a few of us media critic types have taken to calling for our most influential political journalists to take an overtly pro-democracy approach to their coverage , rather than bothsidesing Republican efforts to restrict voting and potentially overturn electoral defeats in order to install an authoritarian right-wing minority government .\nBut let \u2019 s say journalists did start treating the issue with the proper attention and alarm .\nSimply hearing more about the \u201c threat to democracy \u201d could well be too abstract a concept to be compelling for most voters .\nSo that bring me to two key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c pro-democracy reporter \u201d do ?\n2 .\nAnd what \u2019 s the best way to get readers to understand the consequences should anti-democratic leaders prevail ?\nFor answers , I turned to two people I trust enormously : legendary reporter and former New York Times Washington bureau chief Hedrick Smith , and ACLU national legal director David Cole .\nSmith told me that being a pro-democracy reporter does not mean advocating for particular policies or making predictions filled with doom .\nIt requires relentless , probing reporting on lawmakers , partisan authoritarians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairness of our democracy for the pursuit of power .\nCole told me that it \u2019 s hard to predict how much damage an autocratic American government could do , because he is hopeful that the strength of \u201c civil society \u201d in the United States \u2013interest groups , the media , cultural and religious groups \u2013 will preclude at least some worst-case scenarios .\nBut he said there is legitimate cause for alarm on behalf of immigrants and others most likely to become targets of the government .\nAnd he urged journalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under autocracies around the globe \u2013 and ask the public if that \u2019 s the kind of country they want to live in .\nHe worked at the New York Times for 26 years in Saigon , Cairo , Paris , and the American South before serving as bureau chief in both Moscow and Washington .\nThen he moved into reporting and producing documentaries for PBS .\n\u201c The Russians , \u201d his first book , was a mega-best-seller in 1976 .\nI gave his latest book , \u201c Who Stole the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 , and think of it often .\nHe now runs a website called Reclaim the American Dream , and he wrote there in October about the \u201c danger to American democracy and election integrity \u201d presented by \u201c the brazen GOP schemes to gain partisan control of the traditionally non-partisan process of counting and certifying the vote.\n\u201d Faced with such a story , Smith told me , reporters shouldn \u2019 t turn into opinion writers or prognosticators .\n\u201c As a news analyst , I can not tell the reader \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I think so .\nThat \u2019 s not my job , \u201d he said .\nWhat they should do is cover the hell out of it .\n\u201c You change your focus and change the focal length of your reporting .\nGet in close , get in tight , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Everybody \u2019 s always moving on to the next story , \u201d he said .\n\u201c We still have this thing where we say : \u2018 We covered it once , so it \u2019 s been covered.\n\u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news organizations ought to put dedicated teams on the democracy beat , as the New York Times and the Washington Post appear to be doing .\nAnd the expectation should be that they will produce front-page stories daily , even if it means going back over previously covered ground .\nWe \u2019 ve seen that approach work , he said , as news organizations keep examining the circumstances of the Jan. 6 riot more than a year later \u2014 and keep digging up dramatic new information all the time .\nOne caveat : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , and that \u2019 s connecting the dots , \u201d he said .\n\u201c If you just get it as a bunch of dots , you \u2019 re saying to the audience : \u2018 You make sense of it.\n\u2019 There \u2019 s a need for more connecting of what happened.\n\u201d For instance , he said , the journalism should emphasize that this is not simply about Democrats vs. Republicans , even though it largely breaks along party lines .\nThe media shouldn \u2019 t write off what he calls \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Adam Kinzinger , who are \u201c risking their careers for the Constitution and political fairness.\n\u201d \u201c Somehow we in the media have got to persuade people that no , this isn \u2019 t a partisan argument .\nThis is a different kind of story and a different kind of danger , \u201d Smith said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s the most important political story going on , \u201d he said .\n\u201c We now have a political party which is not committed to fair election vote counts and the rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed to victory at any cost .\nThis is a far bigger story and far more important than most of the media is telling you.\n\u201d David Cole , the public intellectual who oversees the ACLU \u2019 s federal lawsuits , isn \u2019 t quite as terrified as I am about an authoritarian takeover of the country \u2013 but only because he takes comfort in the power of American civil society to successfully resist the kind of encroachments that are so often seen in other authoritarian-led nations .\n\u201c One of the strengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , which is really built on the First Amendment , \u201d he said .\n\u201c The right to speak your mind , associate with others , academic freedom , freedom of religion , it \u2019 s all there in the First Amendment .\nAnd it \u2019 s not just there in the First Amendment , it exists in reality in our culture , \u201d he said .\nPublic-interest groups , ranging from the ACLU and Black Lives Matter to the NRA and the Federalist Society , provide \u201c a really , really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .\nSo rather than assert specific doomsday scenarios , he said , journalists should focus on encouraging members of the public to ask themselves : \u201c Is that the kind of country you want to live in ?\n\u201d \u201c I think a lot of people , in a lot of places , their day-to-day lives are pretty much unaffected by the kind of government they have , \u201d Cole said .\n\u201c They \u2019 re not politically engaged .\nAs long as the economy is working for them and the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel fine.\n\u201d So journalists should report from countries where autocrats have come to power \u2013 places like Russia , China , North Korea , Poland \u2013 and ask the public if that \u2019 s the sort of government they want .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a value to living in a society in which certain things are taken for granted , and the government \u2019 s ability to harass you \u2014 to surveil you , to take your property , to take your liberty \u2013 is constrained by important constitutional principles .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of countries don \u2019 t have that liberty.\n\u201d To be sure , some subgroups of Americans could find their day-to-day lives dramatically affected .\n\u201c It depends on what the populist decides is necessary to demonize , \u201d Cole said .\n\u201c If you happen to be within the target of demonization , all bets are off.\n\u201d Those targets , he said , \u201c could be immigrants , could be homeless people , people of color , transgender individuals , women who want an abortion .\nIt could be any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c it \u2019 s not hard to predict that the first stage would be anti-immigrant , because that \u2019 s always been the first stage of crackdowns.\n\u201d There is also much to be learned by exploring how authoritarians have behaved once they took power .\n\u201c The first thing they do is they attack the institutions of civil society that they see as potential threats to their power , \u201d Cole said .\n\u201c They go after the press .\nThey go after educational institutions .\nThey go after the non-governmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association to advocate for change .\nAnd they often go after religion , because religion is a community of people with an independent sense of normative commitments.\n\u201d And there \u2019 s often a lot of something we \u2019 ve already seen happening here , as well : \u201c If you \u2019 ve got an autocrat who has come to power and is concerned that they don \u2019 t have majority support , then their target is going to be voting , \u201d he said .\n\u201c They \u2019 re threatened by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its will .\nAnd that \u2019 s the vote

treating it like a place-holder until something better comes up .\nNothing will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watch it .\nTell your friends .\nWhat You Missed So Far Keilar started the first show off with a bang .\nThere was no both-sidesing , no false equivalence : CNN correspondent Donie O \u2019 Sullivan contributed a report from Arizona , describing the battle lines \u201c for the future of American democracy \u201d by speaking to members of the Martin Luther King Jr. family and people attending a Trump rally .\nO \u2019 Sullivan explained : We started off , Saturday morning , at that march with the King family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , a voter , in Arizona .\nAnd for her , the fear is real .\nWhat she is seeing , it is based in history .\nIt \u2019 s echoes of Jim Crow , what they \u2019 re seeing with these restrictions that are being brought in now .\nOn the other side of things , there are people , at the Trump rally , who are fearful .\nI think , some of them know better \u2013 some of them know that this is a lie , and it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a talking point .\nBut a lot of them really have been bought so far into this world of conspiracy , that they genuinely do believe that American democracy is a joke .\nAnd it \u2019 s a very , very sad place , for an American , to be , in that mindset , particularly because of lies .\nKeilar also spoke with retired Major General Paul D. Eaton and retired Brigadier General Steven M. Anderson \u2013 two of the three retired generals who wrote in the Washington Post last month expressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a future insurrection .\nOn \u201c Democracy in Peril , \u201d Anderson \u2019 s shared his advice to active-duty troops : \u201c Stop listening to the pillow guy and start paying attention to what our democracy really is.\n\u201d And CNN analyst John Avlon contributed a very useful modern civics lesson .\nHe described the \u201c incentive structures in our politics \u201d as screwed up and leading to increased polarization .\nHe made no bones about saying \u201c this is asymmetric polarization \u201d .\nAnd he talked about the rise of \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of background that is so often left out of political journalism because it \u2019 s assumed people know it already .\nTuesday \u2019 s show was devoted to \u201c disinformation , and the way that it is poisoning the well , of the American experiment.\n\u201d CNN correspondent Sara Murray filed a report on Douglas Frank , an Ohio math teacher who is now \u201c traveling the country and spreading election lies to big crowds , \u201d backed by MyPillow CEO , Mike Lindell .\nKeilar eventually spent about 20 minutes relentlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t discuss , the tsunami of disinformation , jeopardizing American democracy , without talking about the mothership , Fox .\nI don \u2019 t call it news , even if they do , because it \u2019 s not news , \u201d she said .\nShe played clips from Tucker Carlson , Laura Ingraham , and Sean Hannity , and refuted them .\nThat was great stuff , and more media figures need to follow her example .\nWednesday \u2019 s show focused on voter suppression , including a report from Georgia , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relentless Republican campaign to undermine , harass , and replace non-partisan election board members was the main topic of Friday \u2019 s show Rick Hasen , an election law expert who teaches at the University of California , Irvine , offered a dose of common sense and alarm , pointing out that \u201c a baseline idea of how you run a democracy is that you can fairly count the votes .\nAnd if that \u2019 s what we \u2019 re struggling with ?\nWe \u2019 ve got problems , even bigger than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve been talking about , for many years.\n\u201d CNN correspondent Kyung Lah contributed a powerful report based on talking to election workers about how scary their jobs have become .\nThere \u2019 s certainly room for improvement in \u201c Democracy in Peril.\n\u201d My biggest complaint is that it feels too much like any other news show on CNN when I would prefer a more distinctive style and a more palpable sense of urgency \u2013 like Nightline had .\nAs with everything else on CNN , the show depends way too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-the-ground reporting , presumably because the latter is so much more expensive .\nI \u2019 d like to see ordinary citizens who are , for the first time in their lives , terrified about an authoritarian takeover should Republicans win in 2022 and 2024 .\nAnd I \u2019 d like to see taped interviews with Stop-the-Steal advocates that go beyond their inane talking points and instead question them about where they get their news ;

the GOP is Trump In order to keep treating Trump like a normal president \u2013 which they felt obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be liberals \u2013 our elite political media had to play all sorts of tricks on their own minds .\nOne was that they constantly seemed surprised to learn the obvious .\nThen , more often than not , they forgot about it .\nThis week four years ago was bookended by two illustrative columns from Dan Balz , the Old Man of the Washington Post newsroom , and its ultimate spreader of conventional-wisdom manure .\nOn Feb. 3 , Balz finally realized that \u201c The Republican

House under John Kelly is not so calm and competent after all.\n\u201d Presidential aides and stenographers went scrambling after Trump apparently decided he wanted to have a huge parade in his honor through the streets of Washington .\nThe Washington Post reported \u2013 with a straight face \u2013 that \u201c President Trump \u2019 s vision of soldiers marching and tanks rolling down the boulevards of Washington is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and White House , where officials say they have begun to plan a grand military parade later this year showcasing the might of America \u2019 s armed forces.\n\u201d The New York Times reported that \u201c Tanks , jets and other killing machines painted olive-drab and tan could be rolling the routes of the nation \u2019 s capital later this year for a peacetime parade inspired by President Trump.\n\u201d Unreported until 2020 , Trump \u201c asked his staff not to include wounded veterans , on grounds that spectators would feel uncomfortable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to see that , \u2019 he said.\n\u201d Trump finally got his parade more than a year later , for an unprecedentedly politicized July 4 .\nIt cost over $ 5 million , some of the money raided from National Park fund , some bankrupting Washington D.C. \u2019 s anti-terror fund That \u2019 s not all , I \u2019 m just out of time .\nBut how do you feel about how things are going

"Breaches of trust", "content": "Thursday was a miserable day for those of us who believe that the biggest advantage mainstream news outlets have in the long run over the far-right disinformation machine is their credibility .\nMy argument is typically that our top journalists can ( more or less ) be trusted to adhere to core journalistic tenets such as accuracy , transparency , and letting the chips fall where they may .\nBy contrast , Fox and the other right-wing propaganda outlets spread disinformation and stoke grievances that , at the end of the day , can not be supported with facts .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ media betrayed the public \u2019 s trust on Thursday .\nNew York Times reporter Maggie Haberman , hawking her upcoming book , dropped a bombshell : That Trump was known to flush documents down his toilet .\nBut in doing so , she revealed that she had kept that information secret when it might have made a difference , adding fuel to previous accusations that was too deferential to Trump and put her own interests ahead of the public \u2019 s .\n\u201c It \u2019 s hard to trust the press when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re hiding , why they \u2019 re hiding it , or who they \u2019 re protecting by doing so , \u201d explained newsletter writer Parker Molloy .\nA few hours later , asked by Andrea Mitchell about the fallout from the outrageous news about Trump \u2019 s theft and destruction of official documents , Washington Post White House bureau chief and MSNBC analyst Ashley Parker engaged in arguably the most excruciating example of both-sides journalism you could imagine .\nRather than simply acknowledge that this looks terrible for Trump , she ludicrously claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and political arguments from both sides.\n\u201d She equated \u201c the left \u201d pointing out that Hillary Clinton was unfairly pilloried for doing something less serious to Trump saying Clinton did it , too .\n\u201c So , this is one of the blanket issues where everyone is furious at the other side.\n\u201d How are you supposed to trust someone who avoids the truth this pitifully ?\nI also found it infuriating when Parker and other reporters proactively came up with excuses for why Trump couldn \u2019 t be criminally prosecuted .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , for instance , Parker said that \u201c when you have someone like Donald Trump , who , for whatever reason , was , as we have been reporting , ripping everything \u2014 information , memos , articles from the Washington Post he didn \u2019 t like \u2014 it \u2019 s hard to reach that bar of it being nefarious.\n\u201d By contrast , as CNN \u2019 s Katelyn Polantz tweeted , 18 USC 2071 prohibits removing federal documents , and if convicted Trump would be legally \u201c disqualified from holding any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst breach of trust came on Thursday night , when NBC anchor Lester Holt \u2013 in a rare sit-down interview \u2014 asked President Biden a question based on a false , basically made-up reading of an Army investigative report .\nThe report was an exhaustive look at the suicide bombing that killed 13 U.S. troops and an estimated 170 Afghans during the chaotic exodus from Kabul .\nIn at least two interviews included as exhibits , senior officers were critical of either the White House or the State Department \u2013 especially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in no way is it true that the Army \u201c interviewed many military officials and officers who said the administration ignored the \u2018 handwriting on the wall \u2019 , \u201d as Holt asserted .\nThe question , as best I can tell , was the result of something like a bad game of \u201c telephone \u201d .\nIt started with a Washington Post story on Tuesday by Dan Lamothe and Alex Horton headlined \u201c Documents reveal U.S. military \u2019 s frustration with White House , diplomats over Afghanistan evacuation.\n\u201d The authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report , and readers could easily have come away with the impression that they were emblematic of the entire report , which they were not .\nAndrea Mitchell then overhyped the findings in a segment on the NBC Nightly News on Wednesday , claiming that \u201c a damning new report blames the Biden administration for being slow to evacuate U.S. citizens and Afghan allies , according to an Army investigation first obtained by the Washington Post.\n\u201d [ CORRECTION : I previously wrote that the Post had not uniquely obtained the report .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ report \u2019 s conclusions in other outlets several days earlier .\nBut that coverage , I have since learned , was based on a briefing , not the report itself .\nThe Post obtained the full report , including the interviews upon which its story was based , through a FOIA request . ]\nAnd Holt \u2014 or more likely a staffer \u2014 then misinterpreted Mitchell \u2019 s misinterpretation of the easily misread Post article .\nWhen Biden was confronted with Holt \u2019 s inaccurate question and asked if \u201c any of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded \u201c No .\nNo .\nThat \u2019 s not what I was told.\n\u201d Other journalists then proceeded to criticize Biden for not acknowledging the truth .\nWithin hours , Axios ran a piece headlined \u201c Biden rejects Army report on failure to prepare for Afghanistan \u2019 s fall.\n\u201d The Post \u2019 s Lamothe , who should have known better , wrote a story headlined \u201c Biden says he is \u2018 rejecting \u2019 critical accounts from U.S. commanders about the Afghanistan evacuation \u201c .\nThere \u2019 s no doubt that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd in retrospect , everyone , including the White House and the military , should have been prepared for the Afghan government to collapse as quickly as it did .\nThey should have had much more extensive evacuation plans ready ahead of time .\nBut there \u2019 s no way ending a 20-year war was going to be neat and tidy .\nDespite the torrent of negative coverage that sent Biden \u2019 s approval rating downward , history will look kindly upon his decision to pull out from Afghanistan .\nAnd while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , there \u2019 s no excuse for journalists not getting their facts straight .\nI found this all particularly frustrating given that Biden has done so few sit-down interviews .\nFor all the drama of press conferences , it is the long , one-on-one interviews that offer a nimble and prepared reporter the chance to dig beyond the talking points and non-answers to give the public real insights into how a president makes decisions .", "author": "Dan Froomkin", "url":

doesn\u2019t care what you think", "content": "Even in the most unrevealing interviews , New York Times editor Dean Baquet \u2019 s arrogance , cluelessness , and complete disregard for his critics \u2013 inside and outside the newsroom \u2014 comes shining through .\nHe is simply unable to acknowledge the major flaws that profoundly undermine the newsroom he has led for eight years .\nRather , he lashes out at critics \u2014 on Twitter in particular .\nNew Yorker staff writer Clare Malone could have interrogated Baquet , but chose instead to lob him softballs oozing with obsequiousness then f\u00eate him .\nHer article out today is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Be an Editor.\n\u201d \u201c One gets a sense of a man , \u201d Malone wrote , \u201c at the twilight of his career , trying to protect his institution\u2014not only the Times but journalism more broadly.\n\u201d But what Baquet is trying to protect is what he calls \u201c objectivity \u201d \u2014 and what an increasing number of journalists recognize as an intense bias reflecting a comfortable , middle-aged , centrist white male perspective .\nBaquet \u2019 s continued refusal to express any qualms about his paper \u2019 s wildly outsized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor email problems in 2016 \u2013 to the great benefit of Donald Trump , whose danger the paper wildly underplayed \u2013 is evidence of a man who simply refuses to acknowledge mistakes , not to mention learn from them .\nAnd wow is he pissed off about Twitter .\nHe rejects it wholly \u2013 regardless of who is tweeting , what they are saying , or the constituencies they represent .\nAnd he affirmatively urges his staff to ignore it as well .\nHe calls that his job !\n\u201c My job is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should not be overly influenced by criticism from Twitter , \u201d Baquet told Malone , \u201c and that they shouldn \u2019 t be afraid of taking on subjects that are edgy and complicated .\nThat they should report those subjects independently and fairly , and if Twitter doesn \u2019 t like it Twitter can jump in the lake.\n\u201d What a sad and pathetic job that is .\nAnd what a sad and pathetic statement .\nIt precludes the notion that any \u201c criticism from Twitter \u201d might be of some value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Twitter \u201d doesn \u2019 t want the Times to write about \u201c subjects that are edgy and complicated \u201d \u2013 which is ridiculous .\nAnd it asserts that Twitter somehow objects when the Times reports \u201c independently and fairly.\n\u201d Bullshit .\nAll of this flies very much in the face of what Baquet \u2019 s boss , publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. , declared in 2017 , when he eliminated the position of \u201c public editor \u201d that great journalists like Clark Hoyt and Margaret Sullivan had used to hold the Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , Sulzberger wrote in a memo to the newsroom that \u201c our followers on social media and our readers across the internet have come together to collectively serve as a modern watchdog , more vigilant and forceful than one person could ever be .\nOur responsibility is to empower all of those watchdogs , and to listen to them , rather than to channel their voice through a single office.\n\u201d Baquet , by contrast , told the New Yorker : \u201c I could care less about the unnuanced voices on Twitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t care about what our readers think , but I don \u2019 t pay as much attention to Twitter as Twitter might want me to.\n\u201d Baquet also said he views Twitter as a negative influence on reporters .\n\u201c Social media rewards snark and nastiness and off-the-cuff opinionating .\nAnd I worry about that .\nSo what I \u2019 ve liked least is watching that develop within journalism .\nWatching smart people make fools of themselves on social media.\n\u201d The Times \u2019 s own Jonathan Weisman certainly comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star political reporters .\nIronically , however , the behavior by Times reporters on Twitter that most often sets critics \u2019 heads exploding is when they channel Baquet \u2014 when they respond to any criticism with condescension , defensiveness and open hostility .\nAnd it \u2019 s not just criticism from outside the newsroom that Baquet treats with contempt .\nIn the New Yorker interview , he contrasted the \u201c demands \u201d of the \u201c next generation of Black journalists , \u201d on the one hand , to his duty to \u201c make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair-minded institution , \u201d on the other .\nIt \u2019 s hardly the first time he \u2019 s cast himself as the savior of journalism , valiantly protecting it against the youngsters of color who want to center news coverage around core moral values \u2014 like equality and functional democracy \u2014 rather than triangulation and incrementalism .\nConsider what Baquet told Malone about \u201c objectivity.\n\u201d The theory that \u201c whatever your perspective \u201d it shouldn \u2019 t \u201c get in the way of reporting the truth \u201d is unassailable .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectivity \u201d is the opposite .\n\u201c Truth \u201d gets filtered through a white , male prism and a devotion to the middle ground even if there is none \u2014 even if \u201c one side \u201d is lying , delusional and dangerous .\nBaquet \u2019 s \u201c objectivity \u201d reflects an ideology of incrementalism , solidly based on the premise that people who want to change things need to be interrogated and doubted but people who defend the status quo don \u2019 t .\n\u201c The job of the New York Times should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out with the best version of the truth , with your own political opinion held in check by editors and editing , \u201d Baquet said .\nBut what if it \u2019 s not \u201c political opinion \u201d influencing your writing , but rather a fundamental credo that democracy is good , or an informed conclusion that climate change is an existential concern , or the lived experience that systemic racism is still all around us ?\nHis message to reporters who want to write like that is : take a hike .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ re the truth and they \u2019 re deeply reported , \u201d he said .\n\u201c And I think if you want to work for the New York Times in the newsroom you have to embrace that.\n\u201d He went out of his way to praise star reporter Ellen Barry .\n\u201c Ellen Barry does not fill my in-box with complaints , \u201d he said .\nSure he values \u201c younger millennials , \u201d he said \u2013 but not for their moral clarity or their experiences .\nIt \u2019 s all about what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return , they should be grateful and obeisant : Malone asked : \u201c Have you felt culturally or generationally out of step in the past couple of years with your vocal newsroom ?\n\u201d Baquet \u2019 s response : \u201c No , no , I feel extremely comfortable in my newsroom.\n\u201d Well of course he feels comfortable .\nI found that highly reminiscent of what departing Washington Post editor Marty Baron said in an interview last March .\nAs I wrote at the time , the interview \u201c showed that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearing to have listened \u2013 rather than in listening itself.\n\u201d As he has in the past , Baquet again defended the Times \u2019 s Clinton coverage .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t have regrets about the Hillary Clinton e-mail stories , \u201d he said .\n\u201c It was a running news story .\nIt was a serious F.B.I .\ninvestigation.\n\u201d He applauded the Times \u2019 s investigative reporting on Trump , and said : \u201c I don \u2019 t buy that we were tougher on Hillary Clinton than we were on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t have been close .\nIn the most authoritative post-mortem of 2016 campaign journalism , Harvard government professor Thomas E. Patterson concluded that Clinton and Trump coverage by the major news organizations \u201c was virtually identical in terms of its negative tone.\n\u201d Patterson wrote : One study found that coverage of Clinton \u2019 s email scandals across news outlets \u201c accounted for more sentences than all of Trump \u2019 s scandals combined ( 65,000 vs. 40,000 ) and more than twice as many as were devoted to all of her policy positions.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrospect , \u201c I would have covered the country a lot differently in the months leading up to the election of Donald Trump.\n\u201d But it \u2019 s unclear whether he realizes the Times should have been way more critical and alarmist , or whether he simply means reporters should have talked to more Trump voters at diners .\nI understand how journalists can be proud of their work .\nBut what I \u2019 ll never understand is the ones who harbor no self-doubt .\nJournalism is famously the \u201c first rough draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one .\nThat means we should welcome constructive criticism \u2014 and revisit , and sometimes revise , our work .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t want to call myself a great journalist , other people will have to decide what kind of journalist I am , \u201d he told Malone .\n\u201c But I think to run the New York Times you have to be a great , thoughtful journalist .\nThat comes first .\nThat \u2019 s before everything else.\n\u201d And in what we can only hope will be the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and tells Malone : \u201c What did I not get done ?\nFrankly , if I look at the list of things I wanted to accomplish\u2026 I think we did pretty well .\nI can \u2019 t think of anything big we didn \u2019 t pull off.\n\u201d Baquet \u2019 s interviews are always doozies .\nCheck out my write-ups of two previous ones : New York Times editor Dean Baquet wants his reporters to keep an open \u2014 and empty \u2014 mind and Dean Baquet interview demonstrates why bothsidesism is alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .",

Dies in Darkness \u201d \u2013 I was furious .\nIt wasn \u2019 t just that the slogan itself was weirdly ominous and self-important .\nIt wasn \u2019 t just that the Post \u2019 s PR shop went to great lengths to assure everyone this was not a shot across the bow at Donald Trump \u2013 which it most certainly should have been .\nIt was that nothing else changed .\nThis was back in early 2017 .\nOur first authoritarian president had already exposed a slew of weaknesses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unshakeable American democracy .\nBut the Post mostly covered him like a normal president .\nThere were some wonderful exceptions \u2013 an analysis here , an investigative report there \u2013 but day in and day out , the Post ( like its competitors ) downplayed the profoundly aberrational , deviant nature of the Trump presidency .\nIt allowed Trump to get off too easy for lying all the time .\nIt let Trump set the agenda \u2013 even during a disastrous public health emergency .\nIt engaged in mind-boggling false equivalence regarding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become entirely unhinged , in order not to appear to be \u201c taking sides.\n\u201d The Post \u2019 s real , operative slogan \u2014 to this day \u2014 was coined later that year by then-editor Marty Baron , when he famously said \u201c We \u2019 re not at war , we \u2019 re at work.\n\u201d But Trumpism was an assault not just on the press but on truth and democracy .\nThey damned well should have gone to war .\nSo here we are five years later , I \u2019 m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to some extent I blame the media .\nAs Post opinion columnist Perry Bacon wrote last May , \u201c Perhaps democracy dies faster in darkness .\nBut it could also die slowly in the light , as all of us watched but didn \u2019 t do enough to save it.\n\u201d In December , another Post columnist , Dana Milbank , went so far as to accuse his colleagues of being \u201c accessories to the murder of democracy.\n\u201d Now comes the news that the Post is setting up a \u201c Democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major commitment that includes two new editors and three new reporting positions \u2013 specifically to inform readers about the ever-metastasizing threats to democracy from Trump and the Republican Party .\nThe goal is \u201c to centralize and expand our reporting on the battles over voting rules and access to the polls , the pressures on election systems across the country and efforts to sow doubt about the outcome of the vote , \u201d the Post said in its announcement today .\nThe reporters will be based in Georgia , Arizona and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how local and state officials navigate the politicization of the election process , while also tracking legislative and legal battles over voting rules and access to the polls.\n\u201d The announcement , which even includes the five new job postings , describes the expected output as including \u201c high-impact stories , \u201d \u201c complex investigations \u201d and \u201c revelatory narratives about the forces that are reshaping the democratic process.\n\u201d I \u2019 m psyched because the way a news organization sets the agenda is not through editorials and opinion pieces .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the best way to make sure something is covered is to create a \u201c beat \u201d with its own beat reporter \u2013 or even better , a bunch of them , with their own editors to boot .\nWhen you put reporters on a beat , they will find things worth writing about .\nThey will get to the bottom of what \u2019 s going on .\nBeat reporters \u2013 with a few notable exceptions \u2014 aren \u2019 t just stenographers , they are translators , educators , referees and analysts .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be confused with Team America ) , there will almost certainly be strong , fact-filled , hugely disturbing stories about the threat to democracy on the front pages of the Washington Post pretty much every day \u2013 as there should be .\nIt \u2019 s almost exactly what newspaper legend Hedrick Smith prescribed in an interview with Press Watch the other day about how news organizations could pursue a more pro-democracy agenda .\nSmith told me that doesn \u2019 t mean advocating for particular policies or making predictions .\nIt means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a huge story .\n\u201c You change your focus and change the focal length of your reporting .\nGet in close , get in tight , \u201d he said .\nYou don \u2019 t just do a story once \u2013 you come back to it , digging deeper and finding out more every time .\nYou connect the dots .\n\u201c If you just get it as a bunch of dots , you \u2019 re saying to the audience : \u2018 You make sense of it.\n\u2019 There \u2019 s a need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And hopefully , the Democracy Team will embrace alternate ways of telling their stories .\nSome of the best are old-fashioned : Once the staff gets up to speed , they should start keeping an updated FAQ , a timeline of key events , and profiles of key players .\nResources like those should be a click away from anyone reading their latest incremental report .\nIt will make what they write more intelligible to readers who might otherwise tune out .\nThe team members should also have brainstorming sessions to come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using data , and with help from readers .\nStarting a new team like this also offer the opportunity to have the audience come along for the adventure \u2013 which would require radical transparency .\nMaybe a blog in which story ideas are tossed around .\nMaybe a TikTok .\nTops of my wish list is for each reporter to publish and regularly update their \u201c beatnotes \u201d \u2013 the memos reporters traditionally use to let their editors and coworkers know what they \u2019 re working on , what stories they \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re trying to get answered \u2014 in short , what mysteries they \u2019 re trying to solve .\nI may , of course , be overreacting .\nThis Democracy Team could turn out to be something much more ordinary .\nDespite the obvious target \u2013 Republicans trying to establish permanent minority rule \u2013 there is always the danger that the team members will fall back on the hoary algorithms of both-sides political coverage , and will try to be \u201c balanced \u201d in their approach to an utterly asymmetrical situation .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team would tend to argue against that , but the words \u201c Trump \u201d or \u201c Republican \u201d are notably absent from the Post \u2019 s announcement , suggesting a possible hesitation to yell the truth from the rooftops .\nConsidering that the staff will be scattered around states where election results are most likely to be manipulated , contested or just plain ignored , it could simply become the swing state desk .\nAnother danger is that the Democracy Team could become as irrelevant as fact-checkers \u2013 relegated to second-day stories that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that politicians ignore .\nThe Post \u2019 s announcement insists that \u201c members of the Democracy Team will collaborate with other journalists across the National staff and the newsroom.\n\u201d But other reporters could decide that since there \u2019 s a staff covering threats to democracy , they don \u2019 t have to anymore , even when it comes up on their beats .\nThe threat to democracy should be a top story , not a sidebar .\nAnd while I hope the idea spreads , there \u2019 s also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by leaders of other news organizations who worry that acknowledging the threat to democracy is itself a political act .\nConsider the interview of NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik by \u201c All Things Considered \u201d host Michel Martin on Saturday .\nFolkenflik enthusiastically broke the news that the Post was launching the new team .\nAsked if this was a new approach , Folkenflik replied : He explained how different it is from traditional political reporting : But Martin \u2019 s final question was a depressing example of the pushback the Post \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elite journalists who are invested in both-sides coverage as a way of signifying their trustworthiness : The answer , of course , is that it comes down to facts \u2013 and the recognition that , as Folkenflik put it , it \u2019 s \u201c a political debate , but it \u2019 s also an existential debate to the functioning of

"Biden\u2019s experiment in intelligence transparency bears repeating", "content": "A stream of disclosures of the most sensitive intelligence imaginable by the Biden administration in the runup to the Russian invasion of Ukraine marks a huge step forward for government transparency .\nIt dramatically undercuts the intelligence community \u2019 s single-minded devotion to secrecy in the name of protecting \u201c sources and methods \u201d that might be lost if targets learn they are being successfully surveilled .\nGoing forward , it shifts the equilibrium toward greater disclosure .\nThe intelligence findings the administration declassified and shared over the last three months about Vladimir Putin \u2019 s preparations to invade Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by penetrating , at least to some degree , Russia \u2019 s military and intelligence systems , \u201d as David Sanger wrote in the New York Times .\n\u201c It wasn \u2019 t like a single briefing that was laboriously devised for public presentation , \u201d said Steven Aftergood , director of the Federation of American Scientists \u2019 government secrecy project .\n\u201c It was a series of rapid disclosures that could only have been based on highly sensitive collection.\n\u201d As Aftergood explained , \u201c It \u2019 s the most sensitive stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this channel is compromised .\nIn the past it would have been obscured or delayed if it were disclosed at all.\n\u201d But Biden approved the dissemination because he considered the stakes too high to do otherwise .\nAs the Washington Post reported , \u201c officials released the information not so much to deter Putin from invading , \u201d which they considered pretty hopeless .\n\u201c Rather , they were attempting to shape the public debate and disclose enough information about Putin \u2019 s plans so that he could not operate with impunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war that he started.\n\u201d Among the disclosures , as the Post recounted : \u201c They used satellite imagery to reveal his massing of troops along the Ukraine border ; released details of a scheme to install a puppet regime in Kyiv ; and reported that Russia was planning an elaborate false-flag attack \u2014 staging a video that would accuse Ukrainian forces of attacking Russian territory or Russian-speaking people in Ukraine , complete with corpses to stand in for victims and a cast of actors posing as mourners.\n\u201d Journalists greeted some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the lack of hard evidence and repeated U.S. intelligence failures in the past .\nSo did domestic political opponents and some allied nations .\nBut the intelligence indicating that Putin would attack sometime in late February certainly proved accurate , as did many of the details .\nDisclosures of contentious intelligence represent a bit of a puzzle for reporters .\nOne the one hand , they should continue to be skeptical of intelligence that isn \u2019 t supported with hard evidence .\nOn the other , they should push for greater transparency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Feb. 11 , national security adviser Jake Sullivan suggested two things reporters could keep in mind when assessing credibility : motive , and open-source intelligence .\n\u201c In the situation in Iraq , intelligence was used and deployed from this very podium to start a war .\nWe are trying to stop a war , to prevent a war , to avert a war .\nAnd all we can do is come here before you in good faith and share everything that we know to the best of our ability , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c there \u2019 s another big difference between what happened in 2003 and what \u2019 s happening in 2022 , and that is \u2014 in that case , it was information about intentions , about a hidden thing , stuff that couldn \u2019 t be seen .\nToday , we are talking about more than 100,000 Russian troops amassed along the Ukrainian border , with every capacity out there in the open for people to see .\nIt \u2019 s all over social media .\nIt \u2019 s all over your news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new phase where we were talking about what we were seeing .\nThis is a very different way to do diplomacy , \u201d a senior administration official told the Post .\nBut will that phase continue , now that diplomacy is kind of moot ?\nAftergood certainly hopes it will .\n\u201c It \u2019 s something we haven \u2019 t seen before and it means we could hope for more of it in the future , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Culturally , it represents a shift for the intelligence community.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a special case .\n\u201c This whole phenomenon is best understood as a tactical maneuver.\n\u201d The hope was that the public airing of intelligence \u201c would befuddle or bewilder the Russians and complicate their plan , that it would reassure and strengthen allies.\n\u201d Aftergood said that as a result , it doesn \u2019 t necessarily represent \u201c a broad commitment to intelligence transparency.\n\u201d It \u2019 s all going to depend on \u201c who \u2019 s calling the shots , \u201d he said .\nIt \u2019 s \u201c imaginable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Or one could imagine a sharp reversal from what we \u2019 ve just seen.\n\u201d If you missed it , I highly recommend the Feb. 24 New York Times article by Julian E. Barnes and David E. Sanger ( this link gets you past the firewall . )\nThey wrote that some disclosures may actually continue : The intelligence disclosures may not be over now that the invasion has begun .\nThe Biden administration has made clear it does not want to take on the job of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it may continue its information releases , as officials mull various options to hold Russia accountable for its actions in Ukraine , according to people familiar with the discussion .\nThose ongoing efforts could involve countering Russian propaganda that frames Moscow as the guardians and liberators of the Ukrainian people , not an occupying force .\nIt could also involve work to expose potential war crimes and try to give the lie to Russian claims that their war aims are limited .\nI \u2019 m thinking : Of course they should do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And why not make Russian troop movements public ?\nIt \u2019 s been very hard for journalists to capture the big picture , why not help them keep the public accurately informed ?\nI certainly don \u2019 t see why intelligence sources couldn \u2019 t be regularly guiding reporters and the public to open-source information they \u2019 ve judged to be reliable .\nAnd now that officials have confirmed that even Putin and his top henchmen can be effectively surveilled , isn \u2019 t it time for them to tell ordinary people what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re subject to ?\nNearly nine years after Edward Snowden disclosed mass surveillance by the NSA magnitudes greater than almost anyone had suspected , we still don \u2019 t know the extent to which NSA spies on U.S. communications , despite legal protections , nor whether it applies any restraint at all to spying on communications around the world .\nHow many emails , texts , and call transcripts does the NSA capture and store and search ?\nIntelligence is gathered to serve the national interest , not to be hoarded in secrecy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public in on those secrets turned out to be the right one .\nIt often is .", "author": "Dan Froomkin", "url": "https://presswatchers.org/2022/02/bidens-experiment-in-intelligence-transparency-bears-repeating/", "published": "Fri, 25 Feb 2022

bad .\nDean Baker is my guru on this stuff .\nHe has long bemoaned the state of big-media economic coverage on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosted by the Center for Economic and Policy Research ( CEPR ) , a group Baker co-founded in 1999 and where he still serves as senior economist .\nBaker recently called my attention to Emily Peck \u2019 s article in Axios headlined \u201c Voters aren \u2019 t feeling the record job gains , polling finds \u201c .\nPeck reported that the country saw stunning , record job growth last year , but according to a poll from Navigator Research , a progressive polling group , 35 percent of voters believe jobs were actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t know one way or the other .\nOnly 28 percent said , correctly , that jobs were created .\nLess than half of those \u2014 only 12 percent \u2014 knew that it was more jobs created than in any other year in history .\nSimilarly , only 19 percent said they thought the U.S. economy experienced more job growth than normal in the past year .\nThe plurality \u2013 35 percent \u2013 said they thought more jobs were lost than usual , which is of course spectacularly wrong .\nOthers polls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the economy seemingly out of proportion with how it \u2019 s really doing .\nWall Street Journal reporter Josh Mitchell wrote in late February about a Gallup poll that showed consumers feeling \u201c as bad as they did in the financial-crisis year of 2009 \u201d .\nHe wrote : Sure those are factors .\nBut how big a factor is it that almost everything they hear on the news about the economy is negative ?\nAnd it \u2019 s not just right-wing media .\nI took a close look last month at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what I found is that the Washington Post and the New York Times seemed to go out of their way to find bad things to say about it .\nNot coincidentally , Post and Times reporters often link President Biden \u2019 s re-election hopes to the health of the economy .\nIncidentally , the most positive report came from the Wall Street Journal , whose business-minded readers presumably care about how the economy is actually doing , rather than the optics or the politics .\nYou know what really ticks me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single corporate-media story even raising the possibility that the media itself is responsible for the disproportionately negative ( and inaccurate ) views of the economy .\nAnd remember that in those Navigator Research questions , people weren \u2019 t being asked about their feelings .\nThey were asked about facts .\nAnd they got them wildly wrong .\nThat should be highly alarming the news executives .\nAs Baker tweeted , it should at the very least encourage them to assign further stories : Realistically , one factor has got to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation .\nAs Baker wrote here : Indeed , Baker \u2019 s media criticism \u2013 over decades \u2013 has been insufficiently appreciated .\nHis asks of economics reporters are actually often quite modest .\nFor instance , he has urged them to consider using denominators as well as numerators : He has been a scourge of the Washington consensus \u2013 especially as expressed in the Washington Post editorial pages \u2014 that if one is serious about cutting the deficit , which one should be , one must cut entitlements .\nJust this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrew Van Wagner , Baker made a strong case that the corporate media coverage of Biden in general is overwhelmingly negative .\nHis conclusion : The media has basically branded Biden as a failure .\nThey \u2019 ve substituted this \u201c failure \u201d branding for reality again and again .\nAnd Afghanistan is probably the most dramatic example .\nIt \u2019 s true that Biden made a serious blunder with his foolish statement that we wouldn \u2019 t see a Vietnam-style collapse and evacuation\u2014I \u2019 m not sure whether Biden got bad information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the media routinely refers to the withdrawal as disastrous when in reality Biden managed to get somewhere around 120,000 people out of the country in the span of two to three weeks\u2014that \u2019 s truly remarkable and far more than most observers had thought possible .\nSo rather than giving Biden credit on a remarkably successful evacuation performance , the media pushed the idea that the withdrawal was a disaster .\nSpecifically on the economic coverage , Baker says : And he very accurately points out that journalists have entirely different baselines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two baselines are actually accurate , and it \u2019 s reasonable for journalists to think that way \u2013 but only if they openly acknowledge that \u2019 s where they \u2019 re coming from .\nOtherwise , their coverage makes no sense .\nDaily journalists , for better or for worse , are hard-wired to leap on departures from the norm , regardless of how miserable , unethical , unfair , and doomed the norm is .\nSo it \u2019 s not \u201c news \u201d when the GOP lies and obstructs .\nThat \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nIt \u2019 s not \u201c news \u201d when the Democrats attempt to govern .\nPolitical reporters looking for \u201c news \u201d instead focus on how well each party is doing at their thing .\nThat is not an excuse .\nThat is an explanation .\nObviously , the results are dire .\nI hold out little hope that our newsroom leaders will change any of this anytime soon .\nRather , it reminds me of the first time I fully , viscerally realized just how badly modern big-media political reporting was failing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great national import .\nIt was 2003 , and what did it was a Washington Post story noting

retreat today in Munich .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep his focus on criticism of Mr. M\u00fcller , tying the new economic turmoil to longstanding mismanagement of inflation and unemployment .\nTwelve Nazi

how to handle America and , to a lesser extent , Britain and France .\nAnd with inflation and joblessness already high , linking Mr. M\u00fcller \u2019 s handling of the stock market crash to his domestic woes could prove to be a potent argument with voters .\nThe danger , foreign policy experts say , is that a depression in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and industrial might , could have a contagion

making a potent case to German voters .\nBERLIN \u2014 Immediately after the U.S. stock market plunged , the political debate in the Reichstag was a free-for-all .\nThe governing Social Democrats and their coalition allies \u2014 the conservative People \u2019 s Party and the Centre Party \u2014 aligned behind Chancellor Hermann M\u00fcller , exhibiting what was once considered a traditional show of unity in a crisis .\nBut from the left and right , Communist and Nazi lawmakers portrayed Mr. M\u00fcller as weak and indecisive .\nIn perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to exult over the Wall Street crash , saying it foretold the coming collapse of global elites .\nNow , Nazi leaders are fine-tuning their message .\nThe party leader , Adolf Hitler , will declare Friday that \u201c Jews and Bolsheviks are to blame for America \u2019 s stock market crash , and Germany must free itself from both , \u201d according to excerpts from a speech that the war veteran will deliver at a party retreat today in Munich .\nOther Nazis have urged Mr. Hitler to keep his focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new economic turmoil to longstanding mismanagement of inflation and unemployment .\nTwelve Nazi members of the Reichstag \u2014 all elected last year \u2014 have hammered the chancellor all week .\n\u201c We can only protect our economy by rebuilding the German military , \u201d Nazi lawmakers from Prussia and Bavaria said in a statement .\n\u201c People in our states can not afford another bout of inflation , and can not afford to be held hostage by Jewish bankers in New York and London and Communist agitators in Hamburg and St. Petersburg.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ critique crumble upon closer inspection , the newly coordinated message is unifying the far right after a fractious intramural debate over how to handle America and , to a lesser extent , Britain and France .\nAnd with inflation and joblessness already high , linking Mr. M\u00fcller \u2019 s handling of the stock market crash to his domestic woes could prove to be a potent argument with voters .\nThe danger , foreign policy experts say , is that a depression in the United States , given its vast wealth and industrial might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking down many other economies with it , including those of Western Europe and Japan , and unsettling a world that is still slowly recovering from the Great War of 1914-18 .\n\u201c It \u2019 s like foreign policy is a blank screen on which we project all our internal divides , \u201d said Hans-Georg Miller , co-editor of The Liberal Patriot , a website focused on the politics of national security .\n\u201c As if the Americans are just props in our own political story.\n\u201d In focusing on American capitalism \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish sponsors \u2014 the Nazis are aggravating divisions in Mr. M\u00fcller \u2019 s coalition that have emerged since the death last month of Gustav Stresemann , the widely admired centrist statesman who was very close to Mr. M\u00fcller , despite their political differences .\nThe Social Democrats recognize how fragile their Reichstag coalition is .\nThey have to manage anger from their working-class base over painful budget cuts .\nThe party \u2019 s left flank is demanding nationwide unemployment insurance , accident insurance for workers in dangerous jobs , and pensions for unemployed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening to defect to the Communists if its demands aren \u2019 t met .\nMeanwhile , the Social Democrats \u2019 coalition partners have wildly diverging agendas : the People \u2019 s Party wants to restore the power of Prussian elites , while the Centre Party \u2019 s priority is defending the prerogatives of the Catholic Church .\nSenior Social Democrats in the Reichstag support legislation to prop up the Reichsmark , restrict stock speculation , issue new government bonds , and increase taxes on industrialists .\nCoalition partners , however , oppose such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been formally independent from the government since 1925 and arguing that Germany can not afford to take on any more debt .\nThey are threatening to block any economic relief package the chancellor sends to the Reichstag unless unemployment benefits are reduced first .\nMr. M\u00fcller may have to relent .\nOther influential Social Democrats have signaled their support .\n\u201c It just infuriates me to think that our economy is dependent on the American stock market , \u201d a senior Social Democrat told the ring-wing paper Der St\u00fcrmer .\nThe Nazis say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already near the brink of collapse , and that political pluralism is a sign of cultural decadence and governmental dysfunction .\nRiding a wave of support from voters sympathetic to their populist message of restoring national greatness , the Nazis entered the Reichstag for the first time last year .\nThey are now pushing for even more aggressive moves , such as resuming military spending , remilitarizing the Rhineland , and even asserting territorial claims in Central Europe , although scholars say such actions could violate international law .\nAnd they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Communists and homosexuals , even as the M\u00fcller government argues that those groups are a punching bag and a distraction from Germany \u2019 s deep-seated economic and governance problems .\nThe chancellor \u2019 s team says they \u2019 ve been aggressive \u2014 and they point to an unprecedented series of steps Germany has taken in a matter of days .\nRight after the Wall Street crash , the Reichsbank opened new lines of liquidity , regulators suspended trading in volatile assets , and industrialists began building up their inventory .\nGerman banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States .\nThey \u2019 re even seizing financial assets held in Germany by associates of President Herbert Hoover .\n\u201c We are ensuring that the Wall Street crash does not jump across the Atlantic , \u201d said a chancellery official who wasn \u2019 t authorized to speak on the record .\nMr. M\u00fcller \u2019 s officials liken their actions to gradually building a moat around the American economy .\n\u201c They \u2019 re not intended to max out at the beginning , \u201d said the chancellery \u2019 s secretary .\n\u201c They \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re intended to buffer the German economy.\n\u201d The problem Germany faces , current and former officials say , is one of timing .\nHow long can Mr. M\u00fcller \u2019 s fragile coalition keep the economy stable in the face of a potential economic downturn ?\nCan the economy be stabilized quickly enough \u2014 if at all \u2014 to insulate Germany from the aftershocks of the Wall Street crash ?\nAnd how can the chancellery juggle all this without triggering another no-confidence vote in a Reichstag that is already deeply divided over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is losing faith in democracy ?\n\u201c Look , conceivably the Nazis win power as early as 1932 , begin a genocidal campaign against vulnerable minorities , and then declare war on Britain and France and , later , the Soviet Union , \u201d said a former Finance Ministry official .\n\u201c But that \u2019 s highly speculative and world war wouldn \u2019 t possibly come as fast as an economic depression .\n\u201d", "author": "Dan Froomkin", "url":

more on understanding it correctly \u2013 than today \u2019 s lead editorial from the New York Times editorial board .\nThe First Amendment asserts a right to free speech .\nIt does not assert a right to not be criticized for speech .\nIn fact , it protects critical speech .\nAnd the protection is against government action , not against other people .\nSo it is beyond shocking to see this atop a New York Times editorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , it \u2019 s hard to know where to start .\nThe fundamental right is to be able to engage in spirited debate without government intervention .\nThere is no right not to be ratioed on Twitter .\nNo one should understand that better than the editorial-page editors of the New York Times , whose job is ostensibly to expose readers to a wide variety of important views , even those which some readers will find odious .\n( They could do a much better job of it . )\nThe forum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influential in the world .\nIf they really believe that people have a right to voice their opinions without fear of being shamed , they should all resign .\nFor the record , Kathleen Kingsbury is opinion editor ; Patrick Healy , who until recently was in charge of the Times \u2019 s abysmal political news coverage , is the deputy opinion editor .\nHow the Times editorial board ended up here is incomprehensible , but one key factor was clearly a succumbing to the \u201c woke panic \u201d that has addled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such that they see threats from an \u201c illiberal left \u201d as existential \u2014 even compared to actual , official censorship and the increasingly likely prospect of an authoritarian , anti-democratic Republican Party seizing and holding control of the U.S. government .\nIt comes , of course , on the heels of the Times \u2019 s publication of an infuriatingly misleading guest essay on March 7 , in which the author ( and the Times , by publishing it ) confused \u201c cancel culture \u201d with being held accountable .\nAnother factor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appear \u201c above the fray \u201d and avoid \u201c taking sides \u201d \u2013 even when the two sides exist in gross asymmetry .\nThe editorial board used to embrace consistently liberal values .\nThese days it seems to delight in trolling the libs instead .\nBoth-sidesism has jumped the \u201c wall \u201d between the political news desk and the opinion side , leading the editorial board to create false equivalencies unsupported by reality .\nCase in point : Failing to acknowledge something very abstract is equated to active government censorship .\nSuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d ?\nThe Times insists that : Yes , but an overwhelming 76 percent said Americans enjoy freedom of speech completely or somewhat ( with \u201c somewhat \u201d being the most common answer to this and other ambiguously phrased questions . )\nThat \u2019 s hardly the same as \u201c knowing \u201d that \u201c cancel culture \u201d exist .\nAnd what is \u201c free speech \u201d ?\nThe Times editorial eventually considers it \u201c worth noting \u201d that there is an \u201c important distinction between what the First Amendment protects \u2014 freedom from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular conception of free speech \u2014 the affirmative right to speak your mind in public , on which the law is silent.\n\u201d But the former is clearly defined , and a right .\nThe latter is neither .\nThe whole poll is worth reading , to show how intent the Times was on proving its point , and how ineptly it went about it .\nA whole series of questions , for instance , appears under this confusing prompt : Examples included \u201c Using social media platforms to call other people insulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views.\n\u201d Two out of three people said \u201c most people you know oppose \u201d the right to do that .\nAt heart , the questions raised by the editorial are : \u2022 Is it OK for people to harshly criticize some ideas ?\n\u2022 Is it always bad when people self-censor themselves ?\nThe answer to No .\n1 is yes .\nCriticism is essential to the functioning of our public sphere .\nIt \u2019 s true that the attention economy reward assholery , and that some criticism is harsher than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s no reason to assert a made-up right not to be mocked .\nAnd answer to No .\n2. is no .\nCertain views that most of us would consider odious \u2013 born of racism , misogyny , or homophobia , for starters \u2014 are held by a surprising number of Americans , and I look back fondly on the days when more of them felt they needed to shut up about it .\nMany of the odious views that were in remission in this country for several decades , at least as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully cultivated and amplified by Donald Trump and the leadership of the GOP over the past six years .\nJust about the only thing Republican candidates stand for these days are banning discussions of racism in public schools and discouraging Black and brown people from voting .\nWe need more shaming and shunning , not less .\nThe reason I \u2019 m calling for the whole editorial board to go is that this particular editorial was hardly something that slipped under the radar .\nThis was a manifesto .\nIt was a declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution : Correct this editorial and resign .\nTwitter was appropriately full of shaming and shunning .\nHere is just a small selection :",

and hurtful things to make themselves feel better at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re passing laws .\nIsn \u2019 t it appropriate for us to try to shame and shun them back to where they think maybe they should shut up ?\nAnd my demand for resignations was not because I found something they said offensive , it was because their manifesto further and definitively proved signified how clueless and unfit they are to operate such a crucial forum for public opinion .\nKingsbury and Healy are in charge , and damned right I think they should be shamed and leave .\nWhat \u2019 s \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @

fighting censorship is crucial work .\nI think the modern Democratic Party is a corrupt and inept mess .\nBut by focusing so much on those problems , rather than the so much greater ( systemic ) threats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermined your credibility .\nYou \u2019 ve effectively thrown in with the smug and the right , who consider \u201c cancel culture \u201d ( whatever it is , as the NYT so artfully put it ) more important than book-banning , barring discussions of inequality in schools , criminalizing transgender , limiting the vote and only honoring the results if they win .\nI remain

and circles and arrows pointing to \u201c bad faith \u201d and places where the argument is \u201c morally abhorrent.\n\u201d Basically , you are proposing an op-ed page with Surgeon General \u2019 s warnings when people are wrong .\nI \u2019 m asking if your idea of a \u201c wide range of perspectives \u201d includes , say , an un-annotated , non- \u201c corrected \u201d op-ed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as someone who \u2019 s never voted Republican and never will .\nAnd as for me \u201c throwing in with the right , \u201d it \u2019 s fascinating that you can say that without identifying any actual right-wing positions I \u2019 ve taken , unless saying I like Thanksgiving counts .\nAs for \u201c afflicting the powerful , \u201d who do you think is in power in this country ?\nI think Google , Facebook , Apple , Amazon , and the banking and pharmaceutical sectors acting in concert are a lot scarier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You use the term progressive to describe yourself because you know \u201c liberal \u201d doesn \u2019 t fit anymore .\n\u201c Liberal \u201d is what I am and always have been .\nThe Republicans have always been illiberal .\nIf the Democrats go that way ( and they have , in a massive way ) there \u2019 s nothing left .\nIt \u2019 s over .\nSo I focus my energies that way rather than stumping for the less moronic , more sophisticated forms of illiberalism .\nBut thanks for calling me right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , there are actually some Republicans who are sincere on the civil liberties front and on the government oversight front .\nI haven \u2019 t seen too many Democrats in the last six years worrying about abuse of power by the FBI , CIA , NSA , etc .\nYes their interest in the issue is self-serving , but at the moment , who else is even looking that way ?\nFROOMKIN : I absolutely believe that Republican views based in reality , argued in good faith , and not preaching hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ op-ed page .\nThat \u2019 s very much what I call \u201c reasonable debate.\n\u201d What I \u2019 m saying is that sometimes it \u2019 s even worth printing views that violate those standards and are highly offensive to some people , if they are an important part of the public discourse ; I think the best way to do that is with complete transparency , i.e .\nexplaining why .\nI said you \u2019 re throwing in with the right because you share their talking points about the existential threat of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Tech , Wall Street and PhRMA are hugely powerful and threatening and are engaged in censorship .\nI think that \u2019 s systemic and worth writing about a lot .\nBut that doesn \u2019 t excuse minimizing the overt and material threats posed by GOP-run states and , potentially , a U.S. government controlled by Trumpists .\nThat terrifies me so much more these days .\nAnd it doesn \u2019 t excuse getting hyperbolic about anecdotal evidence of excesses by groups trying to right the balance in academe and elsewhere between cis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about all the people who get fired for supporting unions ?\nIf I saw the Democratic Party \u201c going the way \u201d of censorship and banishing people like AOC , yeah , I \u2019 d be right there with you .\nAnd yeah , I find their cozying up with the IC to be super alarming .\nThat \u2019 s one of the points you and Glenn are making that I support hugely \u2013 and I think it sucks that you guys aren \u2019 t taken seriously about that because of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your unmerited attacks on me in this discussion , I also see a lot of what I know and love

It didn\u2019t work.", "content": "New York Times opinion columnist Tom Edsall wanted to know how I thought Democrats should confront Republican attacks on culture war issues .\nI told him I have no idea , that \u2019 s not my job .\nI told him I thought that GOP claims about \u201c critical race theory \u201d , trans rights and \u201c defund the police \u201d consisted of transparently bad-faith , bogus , manufactured scare stories intended to stoke white grievance and create fake moral panic .\nI told him the burden of refuting these outrageous , mean-spirited , hate-filled deceptions and lies wasn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalists .\nI told him journalists should reject right-wing framing on these issues .\nThey should refuse to write about them as if they had any merit .\nThen \u2014 surprise !\n\u2013 Edsall went right off and did exactly what I advised against .\nIn his Wednesday column , headlined \u201c Democrats Are Making Life Too Easy for Republicans , \u201d Edsall \u2013 as he has many times before \u2013 amplified centrists who completely buy into Republican propaganda that Democrats have gone so far left that reasonable Americans are horrified .\nEdsall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow self-described pragmatist Ruy Teixeira , who argued that \u201c the cultural left has managed to associate the Democratic Party with a series of views on crime , immigration , policing , free speech and , of course , race and gender that are quite far from those of the median voter .\nThat \u2019 s a success for the cultural left , but the hard reality is that it \u2019 s an electoral liability for the Democratic Party.\n\u201d Edsall quoted one professor saying that after the Black Lives Matter protests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police ' \u201d which \u201c sounded extreme and scary to a lot of people outside of places like Berkeley , Seattle , Minneapolis.\n\u201d He quoted another saying that Democrats are \u201c seen as a party defined by ostensibly legalizing property crime , crippling the police and injecting social justice into math classes.\n\u201d This is all right out of the Republican talking points manual .\nIt exaggerates , demonizes and misconstrues what the Democratic Party \u2014 or \u201c the cultural left \u201d \u2014 stand for .\nFor a brief interlude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columnist Will Bunch , who said too many Democrats are \u201c rooted in a panic that progressive values will be seen as less American \u2014 when the reality is that ideas like academic freedom , preventing censorship and a belief in inquiry , including science , are the core beliefs of this nation.\n\u201d And Edsall quoted me complaining about credulous political reporting that amplified GOP charges that \u201c critical race theory \u201d is taught in public schools , when that \u2019 s an obvious , bad-faith attempt to manufacture white panic .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Third Way report that \u201c Republicans have been able to weaponize culture war issues in ways that significantly damage Democrats.\n\u201d Edsall ultimately concluded that \u201c all Democrats pay a price for what a small but prominent group pushes for.\n\u201d I knew that when Edsall asked my views , he was setting me up to play the role of clueless lefty .\nBut I engaged anyway , for old times \u2019 sake .\nI once had a lot of respect for Edsall .\n( This is now two days running that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sorely disappointed me .\nYesterday it was Matt Taibbi . )\nEdsall and I were colleagues of sorts at the Washington Post and briefly , believe it or not , at the Huffington Post .\nI found him brilliant , and a straight shooter .\nEven in his latest incarnation , as a sort of explanatory blogger for the New York Times opinion section , Edsall used to put his big brain in the service of explaining reality .\nConsider this wonderful 2013 post delineating how \u201c The War on Entitlements \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or , that same year , his terrific overview of \u201c dark money \u201d laundering , and his excellent dissection of how the GOP \u2019 s white strategy was working at the state level , reducing Black power , especially in the South .\nGreat stuff .\nBut these days , almost everything he writes \u2013 much of it hugely repetitive \u2013 hawks his conviction that Democrats need to stop chasing after some sort of multiracial progressivism , tack to the right , and win back white voters .\nA couple years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times defines objectivity as the views of a well-off centrist white guy who doesn \u2019 t even exist .\nBut maybe he does exist , and his name is Edsall .\nWhat seems to animate Edsall the most is his view that Democratic \u201c purists \u201d are responsible for Trump \u2019 s success .\nIn 2016 , he criticized Hillary Clinton for playing into Trump \u2019 s hands with comments on Twitter that he wrote \u201c could be construed.. as admonitory.\n\u201d They included : \u201c I don \u2019 t think a nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the poor and the unfortunate \u201d and \u201c We \u2019 ve got to do more to raise families \u2019 incomes .\nWe can start by raising the federal minimum wage.\n\u201d Over and over , Edsall returns to the same tedious argument , often appending a question mark for cover .\nIn one column headlined \u201c Should Democrats Embrace the Center or Abandon It ?\n\u201d Edsall \u2019 s framing made the answer a foregone conclusion : If the party went too far left , it would lose votes from the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher priority on purity than viability , \u201d he concluded , \u201c they may be risking an indeterminate extension of the Trump era.\n\u201d In April 2021 , Edsall asked : \u201c Should Biden Emphasize Race or Class or Both or None of the Above ?\n\u201d He then quoted a scholarly paper \u2019 s conclusion that \u201c linking public policies to race is detrimental for support of those policies.\n\u201d To Edsall \u2019 s credit , he included several quotes from Ian Haney L\u00f3pez , a law professor at Berkeley who brilliantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximize support among whites , without losing too much enthusiasm from voters of color , by running silent on racial justice while emphasizing class issues of concern to all racial groups.\n\u201d As L\u00f3pez wrote : \u201c Since at least 2017 , this conclusion is demonstrably wrong.\n\u201d Rather , he wrote , \u201c the most potent political message today is one that foregrounds combating intentional divide-and-conquer racial politics by building a multiracial coalition among all racial groups.\n\u201d Nevertheless , Edsall ended up concluding \u2014 once again \u2014 that racial issues are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column , Edsall asked a question that answered itself : Edsall is one of those folks who hype the threat of \u201c cancel culture.\n\u201d ( See my column from last week excoriating a New York Times editorial in a similar vein . )\nThe right wing of this country has gone full racist/nativist/authoritarian , but in September , Edsall wrote that the real \u201c driving force \u201d in the country \u2019 s polarization is liberal intolerance and white people who are ashamed of their race .\nHe can also be shockingly reactionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it or not \u2013 the \u201c exceptionally large increase in foundation grants and pledges to criminal and racial justice reform groups and other causes \u201d driven by the killing of George Floyd and the nationwide Black Lives Matter protests .\nHe explained : Edsall quoted a few dissenters , but it was clear who he agreed with .\nAnd his position was , as usual , based on what he considers pragmatism : Those lies about critical race theory were really effective , Edsall argued .\nHe based that conclusion on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a news-side colleague whose credibility on that issue I demolished in a November 2020 post .\nAs Dean Baker , co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research , pointed out in early 2021 , Edsall is also one of many media luminaries who \u201c act like they are innocent bystanders in the rise of an anti-democratic right-wing movement that constantly lies to advance its agenda .\nThe media have agency but have thus far largely sought to pretend to just be observers .\nAs a result , they allow themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edsall quoted me accurately \u2013 albeit in the tiny section of his column he devoted to dissenters \u2013 but I thought the entire exchange might be worth putting on the record .\nI \u2019 m a press critic and political writer who pursues accountability , not a partisan or a strategist .\nSo I couldn \u2019 t begin to answer your questions about what Democrats could or should do .\nAlso , I worry a bit that you \u2019 ve lumped together such diverse issues in one question about the culture wars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at addressing that one .\nLet \u2019 s start with critical race theory , which in itself is really two questions .\nAre you talking about critical race theory as it exists , as a legal theory ?\nOr as it doesn \u2019 t exist but is a scare story concocted by Republicans as a racist dog-whistle to rile up their voters ?\nThe former is a well-documented and important way of making sense of some otherwise inexplicable aspects of our society and laws , and certainly worthy of discussion in higher education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see political reporters writing more about the real critical race theory , and questioning newsmakers about it .\nBut I assume you mean the latter , in which case my answer is : It \u2019 s a phony issue .\nWhat far-right Republicans mean by \u201c critical race theory \u201d is that white children are being taught at public schools that they should be ashamed of being white .\nThis is a made-up issue that serves as a stalking horse for inciting white grievance .\nLike so many of the far-right accusations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t be less true .\nThe reality is that public schools writ large don \u2019 t teach nearly enough about the sordid aspects of American history , or culture , as you well know .\nAs a press critic , I have been horrified at how credulously many political reporters have written about Republican lies \u2013 and how impressed they were at their alleged ( but entirely unproven ) effectiveness .\nThey wrote about it as if it were a real problem , rather than an obvious , bad-faith attempt to manufacture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and here and here and would frankly rather you quoted ( and linked ) to what I wrote there than here .\nTransgender rights is obviously a real issue .\nBut the way the far-right Republicans describe the issue \u2013 concocting scare stories about trans people stalking children , attacking them in the bathroom , threatening the future of women \u2019 s sports \u2013 is phony .\nTrans people deserve the full protection of the law and the constitution .\nAgain , the right is using this issue to scare people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society has moved far and fast on this issue , so I don \u2019 t doubt there are people who are genuinely not OK with transgender rights .\nThey are real , and shouldn \u2019 t be ignored .\nBut that doesn \u2019 t mean right-wing politicians \u2019 anti-trans arguments are in good faith .\nReporters should be writing about the right-wing attack on trans rights because it is inhumane , rather than chasing after right-wing storylines and using their talking points to frame the issue .\nWhen reporters write about it being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should put it in the context of previous right-wing crusades against civil rights , women \u2019 s rights and gay rights .\nPolice funding is a real issue , but \u201c defund the police \u201d is a fake issue to the extent that the far right characterizes it as the dominant Democratic view , which it is not .\nThere is \u2013 or at least was \u2013 an emerging progressive view that the U.S. needs to reassess policing , to make it more effective and fair .\nThat could mean shifting some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service agencies and the like .\nIt certainly means a change in certain rules , and better training .\nThat \u2019 s a real issue .\nBut railing against the strawman of \u201c defund the police \u201d is really saying \u201c don \u2019 t change anything , \u201d which should be accurately depicted by reporters as nonresponsive to the legitimate concerns of the Black Lives Matter movement .\nThat \u2019 s when I tried to save him from himself :", "author": "Dan Froomkin", "url":

\u201c Teachers who mention sexuality are \u2018 grooming \u2019 kids , conservatives say , \u201d post reporters Hannah Natanson and Moriah Balingit started off their story with three paragraph of unrebutted , noxious hysteria : The spokeswoman for Florida \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that anyone who opposes a bill forbidding teachers from talking about gender identity or sexual orientation with students in early grades is \u201c probably a groomer or at least you don \u2019 t denounce the grooming of 4-8 year old children.\n\u201d A few days later , Fox News host Laura Ingraham asked on national television , \u201c When did our public schools , any schools , become what are essentially grooming centers for gender identity radicals ?\n\u201d And , speaking before the Tennessee House of Representatives in February , country music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children access to graphic books to sexual predators \u2014 adding he believes that there is \u201c bona fide grooming taking place \u201d

out ?\n\u201d he asked .\nStudents \u201c can run away from the guy in the white van.\n\u201d Then came what journalists call the \u201c nut graph \u201d : the paragraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about .\nBut instead of clearly debunking and critiquing this insane , divisive filth , Natanson and Balingit put together a confusing jumble of words and sentences that entirely withholds judgment : In the charged debate over what and how children should learn about sexual orientation and gender identity , some mainstream Republicans are tagging those who defend such lessons as \u201c groomers , \u201d claiming that proponents of such teaching want children primed for sexual abuse .\nThe argument draws on previous tactics adopted by the right to oppose the erosion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition , experts say .\nThey point out that , while groomer rhetoric seems designed to appeal to fringe partisans , it is part of a conservative effort to foster a moral panic that will help limit how and what educators teach \u2014 by restricting history lessons , banning books , and curbing discussions of systemic racism and LGBTQ issues .\nNo , it \u2019 s not a \u201c charged \u201d debate .\nIt \u2019 s one side hurling wildly deceitful and utterly disgusting accusations at educators and their champions .\nNo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how children should learn about sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\u201d It \u2019 s about using radical extremist calumny to set off a culture war about whatever \u2019 s handy , to incite the base .\nThe statement that it \u2019 s a lot like the tactics adopted to \u201c oppose the erosion of traditional gender roles \u201d is absurdly euphemistic .\nThese tactics were used to fight against basic human rights .\n( And even that conclusion is kept at arm \u2019 s length , lamely attributed to unnamed \u201c experts.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ostensibly \u201c point out \u201d that it \u2019 s an attempt to foster \u201c moral panic \u201d \u2014 but accept on face value that the goal is to change what \u2019 s happening in schools .\nIt \u2019 s not .\nThe goal is the moral panic itself .\nSo let me rewrite that for you .\nHere \u2019 s what they should have written after those first three paragraphs : The rhetoric from some mainstream Republicans that those who resist repressive assaults on sex education in schools are \u201c grooming \u201d children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceptive and reprehensible by any normal standard .\nUsing unfounded accusations of abhorrent conduct to incite moral panic is reminiscent of the shameful tactics adopted by the right to oppose the expansion of racial equality , women \u2019 s rights and gay rights during earlier periods of societal transition .\nIts re-adoption by the modern GOP sets the political discourse in this country back decades .\nIn the absence of extensive , bipartisan refutation and condemnation , these vicious lies will almost certainly result in further censorship of public school teachers in Republican-led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to talking to their students about history , racism , and LGBTQ issues .\nBut the real goal \u2013 just as it was when Glenn Youngkin won the Virginia governorship after falsely accusing public schools of teaching critical race theory \u2014 has nothing to do with what is really going on in schools , and everything to do with inciting the Republican Party \u2019 s increasingly angry base , whatever it takes .\nThen , instead of forcing readers to wade through eight more paragraphs of insane accusations and the attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved up the comments from Sophie Bjork-James , an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University , especially this part : And I would have provided some essential context , making it crystal clear that the people saying this stuff \u2013 and the people they are trying to rile up \u2014 are dead-enders on the fringe of society .\nI would have reminded readers that an overwhelming majority of Americans across religious and political affiliations now support anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people ; that only 1 in 4 Americans think we have \u201c gone too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that two out of three Americans support gay marriage .\nI wouldn \u2019 t have used the word \u201c conservatives \u201d to describe these people .\nI would have described them as extremist , right-wing totalitarian theocratic provocateurs .\nI would have called it a conspiracy theory , and reflected on how it relates to the ones that have given us Pizzagate and Qanon and the Jan. 6 insurrection .\nI would have noted that one common feature of the Trump-led Republican Party is that the accusations it hurls are often true not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI would have shown how it \u2019 s Republican Party leaders who have actually been caught engaging in or enablilng sexual abuse of children : Former House speaker Dennis Hastert , who abused teenaged boys ; Rep. Jim Jordan , who covered up a sex-abuse scandal in college ; Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore , who sexually assaulted teenage girls ; and Jeffrey Epstein pal Donald Trump .\nI would have popped in a paragraph about how it \u2019 s GOP states that are re-legalizing heterosexual marriage between adults and children .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving sex with children have become so generic and so disconnected from reality that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene just accused fellow Republicans of being \u201c pro-pedophile \u201d for supporting the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court .\nI agree with the Nation \u2019 s Joan Walsh , who complains of \u201c insufficient media attention to the way these lurid claims about Democrats have been mainstreamed in the Republican Party , over the years and around the country.\n\u201d And I keep asking myself : What is happening in our major-media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out something this messed up ?\nWill they ever be braver ?\nWhat will it take ?", "author": "Dan

misinformation .\nWhat it \u2019 s not is a source of \u201c news \u201d \u2014 at least not by any normal definition .\nThat \u2019 s one of the conclusions I drew from a fascinating new study in which arch-conservative Fox TV viewers were paid to watch CNN for a month .\nThe study , titled \u201c The manifold effects of partisan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A field experiment with Fox News viewers , \u201d was performed by a pair of political scientists : David Broockman , who teaches at UC-Berkeley , and Joshua Kalla , who teaches at Yale .\nAccording to Broockman and Kalla , when these Fox viewers watched CNN , they heard about all sorts of things Fox wasn \u2019 t telling them .\nThey processed that information .\nThey took it in .\nThey became more knowledgeable about what was really going on in the United States .\nThe experiment didn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in just one month .\nBut it slightly altered their perceptions of certain key issues and political candidates .\nThe study authors differentiated between \u201c traditionally emphasized forms of media influence , \u201d like agenda setting and framing , and what they call \u201c partisan coverage filtering \u201d : the choice to selectively report information about selective topics , based on what \u2019 s favorable to the network \u2019 s partisan side , and ignore everything else .\nOne lesson here is that Fox viewers are reachable with real news .\nWhile fact-checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe falsehoods even more strongly , plain news \u2014 and even opinionated news \u2014 still registers .\nBut the biggest takeaway for me is the realization that Fox viewers aren \u2019 t just manipulated and misinformed \u2014 they are literally being made ignorant by their consumption habits .\nWatching Fox , they hear a lot of \u201c news-like \u201d things , but they don \u2019 t learn about what \u2019 s really happening .\nAnd here \u2019 s where we in the mainstream media can do something useful : We can stop

absence of news .\nWe can explain more clearly that real news organizations present viewers with the information they need regardless of whether it hurts or helps a specific cause or political party .\nMainstream , reality-based journalists have been way too charitable to Fox over the years , partly because the network once employed some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fa\u00e7ade of political neutrality .\nBut it \u2019 s time to firmly declare that Fox is not news .\nThe study started with 763 far-right loyal Fox News viewers , then randomly assigned 40 percent to a \u201c treatment \u201d group .\nThat group was then paid $ 15 an hour to watch up to seven hours of CNN per week during September 2020 , during prime-time hours .\nParticipants were given quizzes to make sure they were paying attention .\nIt found that CNN and Fox were covering dramatically different things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Trump administration \u2019 s failures to control it \u201c were by far the most common topics on CNN \u201d \u2014 even as Fox downplayed it and praised Trump \u2019 s behavior .\nBy contrast , Fox News spent 15,236 words discussing \u201c Biden/Democrats support for extreme racial ideology/protests , \u201d to CNN \u2019 s 1,300 .\nThe study found that the CNN-watching group was \u201c much more likely to see issues covered on CNN ( COVID-19 ) instead of on Fox News ( racial protests ) as important.\n\u201d The group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if Donald Trump made a mistake , Fox News would not cover it.\n\u201d One particularly hopeful finding was that watching CNN caused Fox viewers \u201c to become substantially more supportive of vote-by-mail than the control group.\n\u201d Both networks covered the topic extensively , with CNN emphasizing facts about how secure it is , and Fox falsely hawking its susceptibility to fraud .\nRepublican measures to block Democratic constituencies from voting and challenge results not to their liking depend heavily on Republican voters believing lies about Democrats engaging in massive fraud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partisan slants happen on both sides of the cable news spectrum is the one false note in their report .\nFox and CNN are not

white Christian nationalism ?\nCould they really be so dim that they don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to lull American voters into a false sense of security so we don \u2019 t get too alarmed ?\nThe Republican Party today is the Trump Party .\nBut at the New York Times in particular , it is institutional orthodoxy that the real GOP is something else entirely : It \u2019 s normal , genteel , and rational .\nIt just can \u2019 t poke its head up too far right now for various reasons .\nI \u2019 m constantly amazed at the lengths reporters will go to in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit up !\nSo what you get is the Times \u2019 s Annie Karni writing that Republicans \u201c have been intent on rehabilitating themselves in the eyes of voters after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol last year.\n\u201d You get the Washington Post \u2019 s Ashley Parker insisting on MSNBC that the true Republican leaders are just raring to throw off their Trumpist mantles .\n\u201c What we think of as the establishment , \u201d Parker said , \u201c these members , these operatives , privately , their preference would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just make Donald Trump disappear , they would all love to do that.\n\u201d Why won \u2019 t these reporters acknowledge the obvious ?\nWhy don \u2019 t they warn us ?\nPolitical reporters in our top newsrooms are basically cheerleaders \u2014 not for a candidate , or a party , but for a winning move .\nThis also allows them not to get too caught up in whether one team is lying , or cheating , or stealing .\nWho is winning is what matters .\nLately , they have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly scurrilous ) GOP attacks on Democrats for being white-hating pedophile groomers .\nThese are manufactured panics , designed to rile up the GOP \u2019 s grievance-filled , anti-government , white Christian base .\nBut they work \u2013 especially when they are not resoundingly debunked by mass media .\nAnd far from debunking them , political journalists \u2013 in the name of not being seen as taking sides \u2013 become their repeaters .\nDuring the 2021 elections , political reporters helped now-Virginia Gov .\nGlenn Youngkin spread race-baiting calumnies against Democrats , based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race theory in public schools .\nThen they hailed his strategy as worthy of emulation by other Republicans .\nMost recently , they \u2019 ve written non-judgmentally about the new Republican tactic of accusing public school teachers and Democrats of grooming children for sexual abuse .\nEither you believe that \u2019 s true \u2013 and you \u2019 re nuts \u2013 or you recognize that as an outrageous lie , a vile tactic , and a sign of utter moral rot .\nBut our political journalists prefer to tread an untenable and nonexistent middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else going on in their brains .\nWhat is it ?\nCovering a rational president is so much less rewarding .\nFor White House reporters in particular , covering Trump was exhilarating and easy .\nTrump would say something crazy , they would write it down , they \u2019 d stick in a paragraph way down about how \u201c Democrats disagree , \u201d their stories would led their newscasts , websites and front pages , and they became TV stars talking about it .\nOver and over again .\nIt might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxing .\nThere was no need to understand or explain the complex work of governing .\nAll that mattered was Trump .\nTracking down Trump cronies to whom they could offer anonymity in return for lies and gossip was like sport .\nBut these days , the White House is more than just one man \u2019 s whims and mood disorders .\nIt is filled with staff , and process , and sometimes competing senses of mission .\nFiguring out what \u2019 s going on and why is hard work , and unrewarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read about policy , right ?\nThe White House press corps is bored by consistency .\nTo make things exciting , they trot out GOP talking points and push for kinetic violence .\nThey ignore the good news for Joe Biden , and focus almost exclusively on the bad .\n( No one made that case better than the late Eric Boehlert , whose humanity and voice are sorely missed . )\nThe result is a voting public that thinks the booming economy is a disaster and wants to put a \u201c check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in power .\nAs I wrote a few weeks back , \u201c When the public thinks up is down , it \u2019 s time to rethink coverage \u201c .\nWashington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan said the same thing the other day .\nSo why don \u2019 t they reset ?\nSo what else could it be , besides wanting Trump to win ?\nOne of the first pieces I wrote upon launching Press Watch was : \u201c It would be insane for America to re-elect Trump .\nWhy can \u2019 t journalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t really understand why not .\nI can think of a variety of explanations other than that the media wants Trump to win .\nOne is the media business \u2019 s hankering for a close race .\nClose races are good for journalism , from both a coverage and revenue standpoint .\n( Then again , most political reporters have already glibly declared that the Republicans will win big in the 2022 congressional elections .\nThat one \u2019 s case closed , as far as they \u2019 re concerned . )\nPolitical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama and conflict , so maybe they \u2019 re drawn to Trump like they \u2019 re drawn to a train wreck , but that doesn \u2019 t mean they \u2019 re actually rooting for him .\nAnd the easiest thing for a political reporter to do is split the difference between both parties .\nThey substitute triangulation for analysis .\nWith the Republican Party having gone to such an extreme , even the \u201c middle ground \u201d is effectively right wing .\nOr it could just be a coincidence that so many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up mimicking a preference for chaos .\nOne thing we know for sure is that Trump was very good for the news industry \u2019 s bottom lines .\nIn 2021 , weekday prime-time viewership dropped 38 percent at CNN , 34 percent at Fox News and 25 percent at MSNBC , according to Nielsen .\nThe number of unique visitors to Politico dropped by nearly 50 percent between October 2020 and 2021 , according to Comscore .\nFor the Washington Post , it was a 28 percent decline ; for the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Post \u2019 s Paul Farhi wrote just a few months into the Biden presidency , \u201c Trump predicted news ratings would \u2018 tank if I \u2019 m not there.\n\u2019 He wasn \u2019 t wrong.\n\u201d By comparison , news executives were giddy about Trump , right from the get-to .\nIn 2015 , CBS \u2019 s then-CEO Les Moonves famously said of the Trump circus that it \u201c may not be good for America , but it \u2019 s damn good for CBS , that \u2019 s all I got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donald !\nKeep getting out there !\n\u201d I suspect it \u2019 s cowardice , rather than avarice .\nThey \u2019 re afraid that if they sound the alarm , they \u2019 ll be written off as biased and untrustworthy .\n( Surprise !\nThey already are ! )\nAnd on a personal basis , they don \u2019 t want to have to admit that they were wrong for so long , and should have sounded the alarm ages ago .\n( And not just about Trump , mind you . )\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm even this late is a moral imperative .\nMaybe one of them will crack , and the others will follow .\nOr maybe not .\nAre there telltale signs of change ?\nI don \u2019 t see any .\nSo no , I don \u2019 t think the mainstream media really wants Trump to win again .\nBut I have a hard time explaining its behavior in any other way .", "author": "Dan Froomkin", "url": "https://presswatchers.org/2022/04/does-the-mainstream-media-want-trump-to-run-again-and-win/",

Elizabeth Warren telling Pod Save America host Tommy Vietor : \u201c I think there \u2019 s a question that the Department of Justice should take a really hard look to see\u2026 does it violate any of our criminal laws ?\nAnd I \u2019 d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that.\n\u201d Hasan continued : \u201c Thank you Senator Warren for saying what many of us have been wondering .\nI mean why has there been so much silence from the Democrats on Jared Kushner receiving a $ 2 billion investment from a fund led by the Saudi crown prince ?\n\u201d Great question the Times could have pursued there .\nIn its story , the Times explained that \u201c No law or rules constrain the investment activities of former administration officials after leaving the White House.\n\u201d But what about bribery ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post took note of the Times story in an online column the next day by Aaron Blake , who wrote about it in the context of \u201c Donald Trump \u2019 s 180 on Saudi Arabia.\n\u201d That \u2019 s a topic the Times could have addressed in a follow-up story .\nHuffPost \u2019 s Paul Blumenthal published a piece based on the Times article a few days later , adding the observation that : That \u2019 s a great angle the Times could have explored .\nWhat is Kushner promising other investors ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inquiry .\nBut instead , Ken Klippenstein of the Intercept got that story .\nHe got his hands on a slide deck showing Kushner \u2019 s pitch to U.S. investors , which \u201c nakedly touts the former Trump adviser \u2019 s work with Saudi Arabia and his links to several Trump-era deals.\n\u201d One source described shock at \u201c how cavalierly it seemed to suggest influence peddling \u201d as a \u201c value add.\n\u201d The night after the Times piece came out , MSNBC \u2019 s Rachel Maddow interviewed Democratic Rep.

emoluments clause ?\nAnd what a great peg this story would have been for the Times to write extensively about the threat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !\nHow about revisiting some of the past reporting on Kushner \u2019 s felonious father ( pardoned by Trump ) , his controversial real-estate deals , or the denial of his security clearance ( until Trump intervened ) on account of potential foreign influence ?\nAll those would have been good follow-ups .\nBy contrast , this is how bloodlessly the Times contextualized the significance of its own story : A Washington Post editorial on the 14th declared the

financial proposition .\n\u201c The carriage fees prop up the entire Fox operation and allow them to be as destructive as they are because they don \u2019 t have to respond to market forces , \u201d said Angelo Carusone , president of Media Matters for America .\nThose market forces include advertiser boycotts .\nMajor advertisers have largely abandoned Tucker Carlson Tonight , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incitement .\nBut Fox doesn \u2019 t care as long as the carriage fees keep coming in .\nFox News \u2019 s going rate is already the highest in cable , with the exception of ESPN .\nFox \u2019 s $ 2.00 rate is nearly twice what CNN gets ( $ 1.06 ) .\nMSNBC gets $ 0.36 , only slightly more than Fox Business ( $ 0.29 ) , according to S & P Global .\nFor a number of different reasons , getting cable companies to \u201c unbundle \u201d Fox or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be an enormous challenge .\nBut the key is persuading them that the demand from the small percentage of their customers who watch Fox News is more than offset by a much larger percentage of customers who consider it dangerous to their communities and don \u2019 t want to pay for it anymore .\nFox will be renegotiating two thirds of its licensing fees starting in a few months .\nUnfortunately , conventional wisdom at the moment is that Fox is actually going to demand even more money from cable companies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lachlan Murdoch is sounding positively giddy in his investor calls .\nIn a March call , for instance , Morgan Stanley head of media research Benjamin Swinburne asked him : \u201c What \u2019 s allowing you to drive rate and grow the revenues even with cord-cutting ?\n\u201d Fox News remains the most-viewed channel on cable , Murdoch said .\n\u201c Look , I think we are an essential part of the bundle\u2026 An essential partner , a growingly important part of the cable bundle.\n\u201d He concluded : \u201c We have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have industry-leading pricing growth at FOX News.\n\u201d Murdoch \u2019 s ace in the hole is that cable companies are hugely averse to losing customers \u2013 and they worry , with reason , that if they cut Fox News , or if they take it out of the basic \u201c bundle , \u201d its slavishly devoted viewers are likely to switch carriers , even though that \u2019 s a big hassle .\nThere are ways the cable companies and other distributors could make paying for Fox News optional without losing its viewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some with Fox and some without ; or they could switch to an a la carte system , in which subscribers choose which stations they want and only pay for them .\nBut the current system has made them an awful lot of money , and still does .\nSo they \u2019 re loath to give it up .\nIt also serves the media conglomerates who make all-or-nothing deals with distributors , forcing them to carry less-popular channels in order to get the stronger ones .\nAnd that \u2019 s not the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to holding Fox accountable .\nTwo of the major cable companies that are powerful enough to conceivably stand up to Fox \u2014 Comcast an AT & T \u2013 own or recently spun off direct competitors to Fox News , making them susceptible to lawsuits charging unfair competition .\nComcast own NBC Universal , which includes NBC , MSNBC and CNBC .\nAT & T shareholders owns most of Warner Bros Discovery , which includes CNN and HBO .\nFree-lance writer Karl Bode has written extensively about \u201c disrupting the symbiotic disinfo feedback loop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving customers the option of not paying for purveyors of false news like Fox .\nIn The Reboot , Bode quoted one expert : \u201c You \u2019 d kill those stations in a heartbeat if they didn \u2019 t get bundled in every cable package , \u201d said Christopher Terry , assistant professor of media law at the University of Minnesota .\n\u201c All of those outlets thrive in the delivery to the audience they get by being included in every package , but in an a la carte cable package , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be willing to pay extra for them.\n\u201d \u201c Imagine if they had to survive in an actual market-based scenario where the number of viewers they could have was limited by the people who would pay to have access to that specific content , \u201d he added .\n\u201c You \u2019 d cut them off at the knees and use their own rhetoric to do so while making cable companies more accountable to the local customer base.\n\u201d Historically , around renewal time , Fox has launched massive ad campaigns encouraging viewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they keep Fox News in the lineup .\nThat boosts what is called a \u201c demand score.\n\u201d But a demand score can also go down , if people call to complain .\nSo as renewal season approaches , Media Matters for America intends to run a massive consumer campaign warning people that their cable company is about to raise their rates , Carusone said .\nThe message will be : \u201c Call them and say you don \u2019 t want your rates to increase because of Fox.\n\u201d It \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite , \u201d Carusone said .\n\u201c Your call to your cable company \u2014 I promise \u2014 is getting logged and tracked.\n\u201d Media Matters has already been collecting the names of would-be callers on its UnFoxMyCableBox website .\nA Reuters special report last October exposed the extraordinary news that AT & T wasn \u2019 t just funding One America News \u2014 a network that has been even more enthusiastic than Fox in spreading malignant conspiracy theories and propaganda \u2014 it actually help create it .\nBut Direct TV , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced in January that it would drop OAN \u2013 and has since done so , effectively crippling it financially .\nThough OAN never had anywhere near the fan base of Fox , that was good news for anti-Fox advocates .\n\u201c That was a sign of cable companies giving in to consumer pressure , \u201d Carusone said .\nAnother source of change : Fox traditionally uses leverage to get the best deal for Fox News , threatening to withhold other properties if necessary .\nBut having sold the film and TV assets held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 , Fox has less leverage than it used to .\nAnd public opposition to Fox News is growing .\n\u201c The landscape has changed .\nPeople see Fox as more toxic now , \u201d Carusone said .\n\u201c They have the least leverage they \u2019 ve ever had , and they have the most headwinds.\n\u201d The growing number of cord-cutters also bodes well for those who don \u2019 t want to pay for Fox .\nStreaming digital providers are by nature better positioned to offer a la carte offerings than cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , little-known ways for some viewers to avoid paying for Fox News already \u2013 one on cable , one on streaming .\nVerizon offers plans with very limited options that can be designed to not include Fox News And Spectrum internet customers can sign up for Spectrum \u2019 s TV Choice streaming service and pick and choose the stations they want .\nGrassroots activist Julie Greenberg , who helped found the Defenders of Democracy Against Disinformation website , said that the battle against Fox News hasn \u2019 t gotten nearly as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 nor from people organizing against disinformation .\nRobert Reich \u2019 s Inequality Media group , for instance , has a \u201c petition to deplatform Fox now \u201d that seems to only serve as a fundraising device .\nGreenberg listened in on a major conference on \u201c Disinformation and the Danger of Democracy , \u201d held by the University of Chicago and the Atlantic earlier this month , \u201c and if there was a word about Fox News , I missed it , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Everybody \u2019 s just dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be coming .\nAs Substack Popular Information newsletter writer Judd Legum wrote last month , \u201c The massive subsidy Fox News receives from non-viewers has always been concerning for anyone who doesn \u2019 t share its right-wing political sensibility .\nBut now that the network \u2019 s highest-rated host is a vehicle for pro-Russian propaganda , the issue has taken on a fresh urgency

them .\nI \u2019 m just surprised that the Times didn \u2019 t explain that \u2014 or recognize that there was a debate at all .\nI wrote a piece about the failures of American press coverage of the war in Ukraine last week for Responsible Statecraft , the online magazine of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft .\nIn case you missed it , here it is : The American media is failing us on Ukraine As U.S. leaders speak more openly about their geopolitical goals , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear war , there are essential questions that journalists should be raising in their coverage of the war in Ukraine that they are not .\nChief among them : \u2022 Is escalating what has clearly emerged as a proxy war between the United States and Russia hastening an end to the war , or prolonging the carnage ?\n\u2022 And : What \u2019 s the best way to minimize the risk of a nuclear conflict ?\nThus far , most American news coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine has reflected an unquestioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States and the West send the Ukrainians the better .\nIt may well be that continuing and accelerating the arming of the Ukrainian military is , in fact , the best of bad options , the quickest way to peace , and doesn \u2019 t increase the likelihood of a nuclear strike .\nBut that \u2019 s a hypothesis , which should be questioned and discussed , not blindly embraced as fact .\nAnd in the meantime , Ukraine is being destroyed .\nCivilians are dying , refugees are fleeing for their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine \u2019 s infrastructure , and young men in arms are killing each other .\nIt \u2019 s time now for journalists to talk and write about at what point the goal of punishing Russia could diverge from the goal of bringing peace to the Ukrainian people as expediently as possible \u2014 and what the West should do if and when that happens .\nFor instance : If there \u2019 s a way for Vladimir Putin to save face and end the war more quickly , would that be palatable to U.S. officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia , if not to regime change ?\nThe New Republic \u2019 s Walter Shapiro has been one of the few media figures to raise some of these issues .\n\u201c Even with enhanced weaponry\u2026 being sent to Ukraine by the United States and NATO allies , the only certainties are more death and destruction , \u201d he wrote last week .\nHe urged more attention to \u201c the conundrum of whether America is willing to grant Putin any reward for his morally indefensible war and the war crimes that have gone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising questions about how to make sure this conflict doesn \u2019 t go nuclear .\nNothing \u2019 s more important than avoiding a nuclear war .\nAnd while succumbing to nuclear extortion feels very wrong , if the fate of the world is at stake , it \u2019 s only common sense .\nThere is , of course , plenty of precedent for the media failing to ask the right questions at a time of war .\nThe reflexive commitment to the more-weapons view at our major news outlets is , unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the run-up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq .\nIn several ways , the two events are not comparable .\nJust for starters , the American public is not being lied to this time , and there \u2019 s an enormous humanitarian imperative in Ukraine .\nThis war also has a particular emotional resonance , especially now that Russian atrocities have been revealed in close-up .\nThat , too , makes it easy for journalists to see it in moral absolutes .\nBut justice for war crimes comes in an international court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s no excuse for journalists to relinquish their skepticism \u2014 not to mention howl for war .\nFor a while last month , White House reporters were repeatedly demanding to know why Biden didn \u2019 t want to enter the war directly .\nCBS \u2019 s Steven Portnoy asked Press Secretary Jen Psaki : \u201c Why shouldn \u2019 t the image of the atrocities from Bucha compel a worldwide unified coalition kinetic response\u2026a military response led by the United States and international partners ?\n\u201d Meanwhile , network TV news is full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms .\nBut as Aditi Ramaswami and Andrew Perez observed in Jacobin , many of the \u201c experts \u201d have been \u201c defense- officials-turned-consultants \u201d whose current jobs \u2014 and clients \u2014 aren \u2019 t disclosed to viewers .\nIn an extraordinarily detailed and compelling New York Times article by Steven Erlanger , Eric Schmitt and Julian E. Barnes about how \u201c the race is on \u201d to arm Ukraine , the only real question examined in the piece was whether it is fast enough .\nBy contrast , the media is consistently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though time and again we have learned that when it comes to the U.S. war machine , \u201c doing something \u201d can turn out worse than doing nothing .\nIf those who support yet more weaponry being sent to Ukraine are so sure they \u2019 re right , they should welcome debate rather than ignore it .\nAnd they shouldn \u2019 t demonize those who are realists about the cruelty of great-power politics .\nCNN ran a powerful opinion essay by Jeffrey Sachs on its website last week , but hasn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His conclusion : Another unquestioned conviction in the media coverage has been that economic sanctions against Russia are good , and more sanctions are better .\nBut what \u2019 s the precedent ?\nSachs wrote : < blockquote \u201d > [ E ] ven as sanctions cause economic distress in Russia , they are unlikely to change Russian politics or policies in any decisive way .\nThink of the harsh sanctions the US has imposed on Venezuela , Iran and North Korea .\nYes , they \u2019 ve weakened these economies , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or policies of these countries in the ways the US government has sought .\nU.S. government officials have made a persuasive case that weapons and sanctions are punishing Russia .\nBut they haven \u2019 t been sufficiently pressed to explain why they think this is the fastest path to peace .\nIn fact , it \u2019 s becoming clearer that they have other things on their mind .\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told CNN \u2019 s Jim Sciutto on Tuesday that the entire \u201c global international security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War II is at stake if Russia gets away \u201c cost-free \u201d following its invasion of Ukraine .\n\u201c We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can \u2019 t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine , \u201d Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said Monday .\nAnd while Washington Post reporters Missy Ryan and Annabelle Timsit described that simply as \u201c a sharpening of rhetoric , \u201d David E.

Further , the report cited an online threat that discussed calls for violence , including \u201c Congress needs to hear glass breaking , doors being kicked in , and blood\u2026 Get violent\u2026Go there ready for war.\n\u201d In addition , on January 3 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special event assessment noting that events on January 6 , such as the \u201c StopTheSteal \u201d protest , may lead to a significantly dangerous situation for law enforcement and the general public .\nThe assessment indicated that supporters of the then President could see January 6 as their last opportunity to overturn the election results .\nFurther , the assessment noted that the sense of desperation may lead to violence , where the targets of supporters are not necessarily counterprotesters but rather Congress itself .\nAn earlier GAO investigation for the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day of the attack .\nMost of the respondents ( 53 percent ) said that the guidance they received on or before Jan. 6 was unclear .\nAnother 33 percent didn \u2019 t answer the question because they didn \u2019 t get any guidance at all .\nOne officers said that if police \u201c had any information on the morning of the 6th aside from \u2018 Prepare for a long day \u2019 they would have had a different mindset when the group approached.\n\u201d Why so many law enforcement officials shrugged off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of euphemisms , but no plausible explanation .\nOne of the major entries in the Washington Post \u2019 s Pulitzer public-service-medal-winning Jan. 6 coverage , for instance , reported that the \u201c

understandable , but where was the FBI ?\nWhy didn \u2019 t the Capitol Police fail to mobilize \u2013 compared to how over-enthusiastically the department deployed officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posed any danger to the Capitol ?\nWhy did Justice Department officials shrug off the need to synchronize and coordinate ?\nWho made that decision and why ?\nAnd how can these organizations implement \u201c reforms \u201d if they don \u2019 t even acknowledge why they couldn \u2019 t \u201c imagine \u201d something that plenty of other people both inside and outside law enforcement imagined very clearly indeed ?\nOn the day itself , the FBI had not one but two command centers staffed up with agents as well as officials from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ?\nWhen did they know it ?\nAnd why didn \u2019 t they act ?\nThe Post story attributed the problems at the Capitol Police to \u201c a pattern of miscommunication , poor planning and sloppiness.\n\u201d It made the unattributed assertion that \u201c To some inside the FBI , \u201d its lack of alarm \u201c was a telling example of how the bureau tempered its reaction to threats of violence from White , middle-aged and middle-class Americans.\n\u201d But the Post left it at that .\nJason Paladino , a reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u201c the FBI received at least a dozen warnings about the possibility of violence that day .\nWhen the day came and the Capitol barricades fell , it became evident the FBI largely ignored them all.\n\u201d He tried to find out why : It seems clear to me that the Capitol was sacked because key law enforcement officials

about whether the U.S. involvement in the Ukraine might have some downsides .\nBut not on CBS \u2019 s \u201c Face the Nation.\n\u201d After hearing from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2014 who called for \u201c more weapons , more sanctions \u201d \u2014 and Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova \u2014 who asked for \u201c more military support , more sanctions \u201d \u2014 \u201c Face the Nation \u201d host Margaret Brennan warmly welcomed Jim Taiclet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin , tossing him questions that weren \u2019 t even softballs , they were bouquets .\nOne can imagine how that might have come about .\nEarlier in the week , President Biden visited a Lockheed Martin factory in Alabama that makes Javelin anti-tank missiles , pitching his requests for $ 33 billion in aid to Ukraine and subsidies for American microchip production .\nSo Ukraine and supply-chain issues were in the news , and Taiclet could address both .\nBut still , what it came down to was a major television network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the largest weapons manufacturer in the world \u2014 the company that profits more from war than any other company worldwide \u2014 and not asking a single pointed question .\nWatch the entire six-minute segment and ask yourself if state television in a totalitarian country would have done it any differently .\nAfter praising the Javelin and marveling at Lockheed \u2019 s ability to ramp up production so quickly , Brennan actually fed Taiclet a line to make it seem like what he was doing is particularly noble .\nThe idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this \u201c on spec \u201d is risible .\nOrders are pouring in , not the least of which being a new request from the Army for $ 239 million in Javelins over the next three years .\nAnd Taiclet himself then proceeded to make the case that for Lockheed , things are looking very good indeed for sales on Javelins , Stingers , and \u201c advanced cruise missiles.\n\u201d \u201c The Ukrainian conflict has highlighted a couple of really important things for us , \u201d he said .\n\u201c One is that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough numbers .\n\u2026So , we know there \u2019 s going to be increased demand for those kinds of systems from the U.S. and for our allies as well and beyond into Asia Pacific most likely too.\n\u201d Taiclet said the \u201c second really valuable lesson \u201d from the war in Ukraine is that \u201c control of the air space is really critical \u201d and then began the upsell : This guy is a weapons merchant .\nHe sees crises as opportunities .\nAnd once the war in Ukraine is over , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tensions with Russia , China , Iran and North Korea .\nHow much are U.S. taxpayers spending on those Javelins ?\nShe didn \u2019 t ask .\nThe Pentagon \u2019 s 2023 budget request calls for buying 586 , at a total cost of $ 189 million , or about $ 322,000 per unit .\nHow much is too much ?\nGlobal military spending was already at astronomical levels even before Ukraine \u2014 topping $ 2 trillion for the first time in 2021 , according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that , more than the next 11 highest-spending countries combined .\nJust how much money is Lockheed Martin making from all of this ?\nIt \u2019 s by far the largest arms company in the world , with $ 67 billion in sales last year .\nIn fact , it made so much money in 2021 that it spent $ 4.1 billion simply buying back its stock \u2014 a move that typically increases share prices and makes stock options wildly more lucrative .\nSo how much did Taiclet earn last year ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bonus will he get this year ?\nWho knows ?\nBrennan also encouraged Taiclet to complain about supply chain issues .\nAnswering that question directly and honestly might have led to embarrassing Brennan , since Taiclet told investors last month that supply-chain issues are already being resolved , and that \u201c we expect these timing impacts to be recovered over the course of 2022.\n\u201d Brennan kept on trying to feed him lines : So it wasn \u2019 t just that CBS invited the world \u2019 s biggest weapons manufacturer to address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 it fluffed him up and tried to get him to whine more , even as he spoke enthusiastically about future opportunities to make a killing .\n\u201c Face the Nation \u201d was an outlier on Sunday , however

more than six years about a major schism in the party between MAGA and the \u201c establishment \u201d \u2013 and are constantly surprised every time Trumpism remains triumphant .\nBut replacement theory is so abhorrent to anyone but a stone-cold racist that , hopefully , it will , at long last , establish a line that many Republicans are not willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-sought schism .\nOr it might not .\nIn either case , political reporters and editors used to normalizing pretty much anything the GOP does , no matter how extreme , need to wean themselves away from qualifiers .\nThey need to be prepared to state , definitively , that those who espouse replacement theory are racist .\nAvoiding explicit references to Jews and racial inferiority doesn \u2019 t make the theory less malignant , it \u2019 s just improves its delivery mechanism .\nAs Washington Post opinion writer Greg Sargent explained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas in ways that insinuate them ever deeper into mainstream discourse.\n\u201d What this means for reporters is not writing that \u201c the racist \u2018 replacement theory \u2019 \u2026 has been legitimized by some conservative commentators and Republican members of Congress , \u201d as Matt Viser and Tyler Pager did in the Washington Post .\nIt can not be legitimized .\nNicholas Confessore and Karen Yourish were correct to write in the New York Times that replacement theory \u201c has become an engine of racist terror , helping inspire a wave of mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2017 right-wing rally in Charlottesville , Va. , that erupted in violence.\n\u201d But they were wrong to say that \u201c replacement theory , once confined to the digital fever swamps of Reddit message boards and semi-obscure white nationalist sites , has gone mainstream.\n\u201d We \u2019 re not there .\nYet .\nIt \u2019 s still just a toxic minority view .\nIt \u2019 s not the new normal .\nAnd they were wrong to write that Republicans like former House speaker Newt Gingrich and third-ranking House Republican Elise Stefanik have \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aren \u2019 t echoing it , they \u2019 re spreading it .\nThey \u2019 re racist .\nSimilarly , Marianna Sotomayor was right to call out Stefanik by name in the Washington Post , but let her off too easily , writing that she \u201c and other conservatives have echoed the tenets of the far-right ideology as part of anti-immigrant rhetoric that has fired up the Republican base ahead of the midterm elections.\n\u201d This is not clever political strategy , it is racism .\nI remember being surprised when I first heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Jews will not replace us.\n\u201d But it sure sounded Nazi to me .\nWhat should have been universal condemnation , of course , was sabotaged by Donald Trump insisting that there were \u201c very fine people , on both sides.\n\u201d I remember a little over a year ago , being absolutely horrified that Fox personalities Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham had suddenly taken to terrifying white people about the invasion of immigrants into their neighborhoods , bent on rape and murder .\nIt was an explicit expression of white replacement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c swamp the voting power of all of you Americans out there who still know the country \u2019 s traditions , constitution and history , \u201d and \u201c overthrow everything we love about America.\n\u201d Carlson said : \u201c Reckless and destructive immigration policy is the penalty you are paying for your white supremacy.\n\u201d As I wrote at the time : \u201c It \u2019 s filthy stuff \u2014 visceral appeals to the very worst elements of American pathology .\nIt reduces immigration to one issue : race .\nIt feeds fear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strenuously called on the rest of the media \u201c to call out their vile attempts to spread hate and dissension through lies.\n\u201d But , as we know , there was no such outcry .\nThe ostensibly \u201c responsible \u201d news media simply averted its eyes .\nAnd , in the absence of overwhelming public condemnation , Carlson and others felt emboldened , and kept going .\nAs the New York Times reported last month about Carlson , \u201c In more than 400 episodes , the Times analysis found , he has amplified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to force demographic change through immigration.\n\u201d It was a huge mistake not to condemn them a year ago , and it would be an even bigger mistake today to allow this theory to simply slide into the \u201c mainstream.\n\u201d Marinating in the details of this particular attack is terrorism porn , and news organizations should stop engaging in it .\nBut this is a hell of a news story .\nIn a New York Times opinion essay , author Kathleen Belew brilliantly unpacked how belief in replacement theory \u201c transforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s not just about immigration , but about abortion , and feminism , and LGBTQ rights , and integration , and intermarriage .\nIf replacement theory becomes Republican dogma , even the most submissive political reporters should be able to recognize that they can \u2019 t possibly keep referring to the GOP as a normal party , or to the upcoming midterm elections as a referendum on Biden .\nThose elections will be a referendum on whether to return to the dark ages .", "author": "Dan Froomkin", "url":

news analysis doesn \u2019 t make up for endless incremental , lobotomized daily campaign stories that exist in a context-free zone .\nThat \u2019 s something the Times \u2019 s newly anointed editor , Joe Kahn , needs to fix \u2014 and soon .\nHere is the article from The Nation , reprinted with permission : The New York Times Has Badly Lost Its Bearings Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get it back on course .\nJoe Kahn , the next executive editor of The New York Times , will inherit a great news organization that has lost its bearings when it comes to national and political coverage .\nWhen the current editor , Dean Baquet , took over the top job in 2014 , American politics still worked more or less by the same rules that had applied for decades : The two rival parties largely agreed on the facts ; they just interpreted them very differently .\nEnter Donald Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disinformation , and white grievance , taking the Republican Party to what had been considered an extremist fringe of alternate facts and conspiracy theories .\nThe differences between the parties were no longer about policy ; they were about truth and lies .\nThen Trump and his loyalists tried to steal an election .\nThe danger to democracy was no longer abstract .\nThe Republican Party aligned itself against the concept of universal suffrage and the principle of majority rule .\nBaquet did not rise to this challenge .\nHe treated the divisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just so much partisan squabbling .\nDuring the 2016 campaign , in the name of balance , his staff savaged Hillary Clinton and went easy on Donald Trump .\nHe stuck to the old political-journalism algorithms even as they stopped producing anything approximating the truth and instead privileged lies and normalized the abnormal .\nHe ignored and belittled his critics .\nHe failed to see that his news organization , which sets the standard for the American journalism community , had lost the plot .\nAnd this is where Joe Kahn comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for six years , and so far there have been zero gleams of daylight between the two men .\nSince his appointment was announced , Kahn \u2019 s defense of the status quo has been aggressive to the point of belligerence .\nBut once he takes charge , Kahn will have a reputation to build , not to protect .\nBaquet had already set his course before this massive political transformation became fully realized .\nKahn has no such excuse .\nKahn \u2019 s legacy will be defined by whether he listens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent past , learns from them , and puts the most influential journalistic institution in America back on its proper bearings .\nAnd there \u2019 s no time to lose .\nThe midterm elections , which could be a pivotal step toward authoritarian rule and a failed state , are fast approaching .\nUnder Baquet , the Times has treated the upcoming midterms like any other .\nReporters have glibly asserted that Republicans are in great shape to sweep , and win back a majority in one or both houses of Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political wisdom that midterms are a referendum on the president , and since Biden is underwater , it doesn \u2019 t matter what the Republicans stand for .\nBut that \u2019 s not what these midterms will actually be about .\nThey won \u2019 t be about Joe Biden , or putting a \u201c check \u201d on his agenda .\nThey won \u2019 t be a \u201c protest vote \u201d .\nIt \u2019 s not just that the GOP has become an insurrectionist party that traffics in hate-filled conspiracy theories and lies .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repeal Roe v. Wade , and Republicans are planning to force pregnant women to term against their will .\nFor decades , the history of America has been of expanding human and constitutional rights .\nAt this moment , however , we appear to be headed the other way\u2014unless a supermajority says no at the ballot box .\nStarting in November .\nThat \u2019 s the real story of the midterms .\nThe goal of a responsible news organization is not to get people to vote a specific way .\nBut it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what \u2019 s at stake .\nThis potential tipping point is what New York Times journalists should be reporting the hell out of .\nEven more importantly , they need to be putting every daily political story squarely in that context .\nI would bet that almost everyone in the Times newsroom agrees with that first sentence\u2014and has no better argument against the second than \u201c that \u2019 s not how we \u2019 ve done it before.\n\u201d The New York Times should not publish daily articles that treat the GOP like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation \u2019 s problems , when it is campaigning by sowing culture wars and avoiding real issues .\nThe paper should not suggest in its daily coverage that a Republican majority in Congress would lead to anything other than chaos , obstruction , and endless political witch hunts .\nNewsletter writers should not be surprised every time Republican voters make it clear that Trump is their hero .\nStar political reporters should stop pretending that the \u201c deepening divide \u201d and \u201c polarization \u201d are the fault of both parties .\nExtraordinary investigative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t make up for endless incremental political stories that exist in a context-free zone .\nIndeed , the lack of recurring reminders of beyond-the-pale behavior has helped create a political environment in which right-wingers have reason to believe they will face no consequences and no accountability , no matter what they do .\nJoe Kahn could change that .\nBut he probably won \u2019 t .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t know where the political zeitgeist will move over time , \u201d he said in an interview with the Times .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to commit and recommit to being independent.\n\u201d The call to more assertively cover Republican threats to democracy is just one element of a larger body of criticism that Kahn should hear and heed .\nThat critique comes from outside and inside the Times newsroom .\nIt is born of a love of journalism and a desire for the Times to uphold its own core principles more vigorously .\nOne fundamental critique is that Times leadership hasn \u2019 t adjusted to the profound asymmetry between the parties .\nBeing unable to openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party has forced smart , capable reporters to engage in deceptions and contortions , including : \u2022 False equivalence or both-sidesing ( \u201c lawmakers from the two parties could not even agree on a basic set of facts \u201d ) \u2022 Focusing on what works instead of whether it \u2019 s true or false ( \u201c Republicans are using fears of critical race theory to drive school board recalls and energize conservatives \u201d ) \u2022 Attributing the most obviously true characterizations to \u201c critics \u201d or Democrats ( \u201c Rufo\u2026has become , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intolerance \u201d ) \u2022 Spectacular understatement ( \u201c in a move that has raised eyebrows among diplomats , investors and ethics watchdogs , Mr. Kushner is trying to raise money from the Persian Gulf states \u201d ) \u2022 Pox on both your houses ( \u201c Democrats , without much to brag about , accuse Republicans of being afraid of competitive elections \u201d ) \u2022 Giving both parties credit for solving problems entirely created by Republicans ( \u201c Senate Democrats and Republicans neared agreement\u2026to temporarily pull the nation from the brink of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaslighting ( Republicans \u201c have been intent on rehabilitating themselves in the eyes of voters after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol last year \u201d ) I write about this stuff in Press Watch all the time .\nAnother major element of the critique is that the Times hasn \u2019 t recognized its obligation to fight disinformation by championing the truth as assertively as right-wing media spreads lies .\nThat doesn \u2019 t mean acting \u201c in opposition \u201d to Trump or the GOP .\nBut it certainly means being \u201c in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and propaganda\u2014and to its purveyors .\nIt doesn \u2019 t mean more \u201c fact-checks \u201d ( which are insufficient , euphemistic , and skewed ) .\nIt means rigorous lie-outing in the main news stories , and more stories about the motives behind the lies .\nThe Times does sometimes point out that large chunks of the population are laboring under serious misconceptions about facts , or have tuned out from news altogether .\nBut reporters and editors should consider that a major problem to analyze and solve rather than an occasion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times also needs to report aggressively and plainly on the racism , misogyny , and Christian nationalism that fuels the right , rather than covering it up with euphemisms .\nUnderlying almost all these critiques is a feeling that the Times has used \u201c objectivity \u201d as an excuse for enforcing what is really its own form of subjectivity\u2014and \u201c independence \u201d as an excuse for not taking any side that might be even vaguely associated with a political party .\nReal independence manifests itself in exposing racial injustice and the civilian toll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself in holding accountable institutions like the Supreme Court , the Department of Homeland Security , the Centers of Disease Control , major corporations , and , yes , both political parties\u2014without fear or favor .\nIt has nothing to do with abandoning truth-telling in an attempt to seek refuge from accusations of liberal bias .\nThe question going forward is whether Kahn sees critics \u2019 suggestions as a threat to the Times \u2019 independence , or a way of reasserting it .\nI very badly want him to realize it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hopeful .", "author": "Dan Froomkin", "url": "https://presswatchers.org/2022/05/can-the-new-york-times-save-itself-and-us/", "published": "Mon, 23 May 2022 17:08:26 +0000",

compromised writer : He \u2019 s chronicled pro-police hyperbole about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed blatant \u201c copaganda \u201d about the mass subway shooting in April ( yes , the one where the bodega guy caught the suspect ) : And he \u2019 s called attention to some exceedingly bad analysis by German Lopez : It \u2019 s all part of larger and quite persuasive critique of how the police use journalists to focus public interest on a very narrow range of interpersonal crimes while ignoring much greater crimes and threats to safety such as wage theft and climate change .\nThey also \u201c try to convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and upticks in police-reported crimes because they want to create an environment of fear and panic \u2014 because it \u2019 s in those times of fear and panic that people reflexively seek order and control , \u201d Karakatsanis said .\nAnd where journalists really carry the police \u2019 s water is when they suggest that more police ( and prosecutions and prisons )

traditional U.S. press has badly failed at reporting dissent in America \u2013 there \u2019 s abundant newsworthy protest but you can seldom tell it from the news media \u2013 and has failed at reporting on poverty , failed at follow-up reporting on the Bush administration torture policies and other actions , and failed to sufficiently report the Obama administration \u2019 s high-handed refusal to deal with those issues .\nInstead of ridiculing the obstructionist Republican party leadership in Washington and the states , as it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they have goals other than serving large corporations and the rich and suppressing the vote .\nNot to defend Democrats , but if the press did decent , steady reporting on politics , made fun of GOP fantasies , and if the Democrats behaved , as Paul Wellstone once put it , more like the \u201c Democratic wing of the Democratic party , \u201d then it would be hard to imagine more than a few Republicans winning national office .\nThe press ignores climate change , a world crisis , for weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America and the remnants of a labor movement are seldom reported on at all .\nHe was always wise , and often prescient .\nIn a 2004 column , he decried the credulous stenography of the New York Times \u2019 s campaign reporting \u2013 which is no better today .\nIn a 2008 column , he decried the New York Times for publishing an explosive story then letting it die \u2013 an ongoing problem .\nIn a 2011 column , he called for reporters and pollsters to track the effects of Fox News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a topic that remains insufficiently explored .\nIn the classic Watergate movie , \u201c All the President \u2019 s Men , \u201d Barry \u2019 s seminal role in the Watergate story was meted out to other characters to make the story tidier .\nBarry criticized the hype about \u201c Deep Throat , \u201d a minor figure whose mythologizing he felt distracted from the relentless reporting work he oversaw

trust us .\nThe direct quote : \u201c The Ukrainians have given us assurances that they will not use these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so , based on those assurances , we \u2019 re very comfortable that they will not.\n\u201d As Shearer pointed out , \u201c Biden \u2019 s administration has already sent Ukraine about $ 5 billion worth of antitank and antiaircraft missiles , unmanned aerial vehicles , helicopters and other military equipment.\n\u201d But the new weapons are in a different class : the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System , or HIMARS , is \u201c capable of firing satellite-guided rockets \u201d that carry \u201c roughly the same explosive power as a 500-pound bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pentagon budget requests , the rockets cost about $ 150,000 each .\nThey are made by Lockheed

blocs , making it difficult to break through , even with prime-time programming.\n\u201d No one will pay attention : Here \u2019 s Bart Jansen writing for USA Today that \u201c the challenge is whether the tick-tock sets off alarms or the viewing public simply hits the snooze button.\n\u201d What journalists should do instead What journalists should do is embrace and amplify the committee \u2019 s attempt at truth-telling , contextualize them , and help make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what they need to do about it .\nRepublicans have tried to turn Jan. 6 into a political issue \u2013 and , of course , the debate is undeniably along partisan lines .\nBut the goal here \u2014 the goal journalists should share \u2014 is not partisan : It \u2019 s the truth .\nThat said , if anyone puts forth any evidence that contradicts the committee \u2019 s findings , then of course that should be taken seriously .\nBut empty protestations that are unsupported by any facts whatsoever should be @

you this was a conspiracy .\nCommon sense tells you it was criminal .\nThe evidence is overwhelming already .\nAs a federal district court judge wrote in his ruling in a related civil case , \u201c The illegality of the plan was obvious.\n\u201d There \u2019 s simply no way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger , trying to bully him into changing the state \u2019 s vote count , wasn \u2019 t a criminal act .\nJohn Daniszewski , the standards editor at the Associated Press , wasn \u2019 t ready to officially liberate his reporters to take \u201c criminal conspiracy \u201d out of quote marks when I spoke to him on Monday .\n\u201c I would say , for your credibility , if it \u2019 s anything that \u2019 s disputable , you should have attribution , \u201d he told me .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that climate change is not legitimately disputable , and other news organizations followed .\n\u201c It has to be so overwhelming that no one could reasonably dispute it , \u201d Daniszewski explained .\nI begged him to consider the existence of a criminal conspiracy to steal the election in that same category .\n\u201c I guess we \u2019 ll see how this plays out , \u201d he said .\nOne legitimate caveat about the committee is that whether Trump and the other conspirators are held accountable will ultimately be decided not by them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A central goal of the hearings is to make a powerful and compelling case and increase pressure on DOJ to indict , prosecute and convict them .\nBut it \u2019 s unclear how much effect if any the hearings will have on Merrick Garland , who will make ( or already has made ) the ultimate decision .\nAs the committee reveals its findings , reporters should absolutely consider whether the narrative , or new revelations , strengthen a potential criminal case .\nAnd if and when the case becomes even more overwhelming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What possible reason other than politics isn \u2019 t DOJ going ahead with indictments ?\nThe court of public opinion matters , too .\nIn certain cases , the appropriate verdict is public horror , not criminal guilt .\nAnother obvious success would be if the hearings lead to reforms .\n\u201c In the end , what you had with Watergate was a real window for democracy reform : A moment to strengthen and improve democracy , \u201d said Jon Steinman , communications director for Protect Democracy .\nLawmakers in the 1970s put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the Privacy Act , new FOIA rules , dramatic new limits on political contributions , campaign finance reporting requirements , new congressional ethics rules and a new independent counsel provisions .\nThe Democratic House in early 2021 approved a sweeping package of voting rights , election , ethics and campaign finance measures , but it died in the Senate .\nSteinman is realistic : \u201c I worry about getting that reform window open at all , \u201d he said .\nI spoke to Fred Wertheimer , who is in his 52nd year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the people .\nHe started at Common Cause in 1971 .\nHe \u2019 s now the president of Democracy 21 , a nonpartisan nonprofit he founded in 1997 .\n\u201c The committee has a tough job ahead in breaking through with everything else that \u2019 s going on , \u201d he said .\n\u201c But , if they can break through , I think they can educate a significant number of Americans who don \u2019 t know this full story of exactly what happened .\nThis wasn \u2019 t a single event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis was the front edge of a movement to replace democracy with autocracy.\n\u201d I told him what I was writing about .\n\u201c Your interest in how the media will respond to this is on point , \u201d he told me .\nI told him I was worried that news organizations would both-sides the story \u2014 that TV anchors , for instance , would tell their viewers something like \u201c Democrats called it a criminal conspiracy , but Republicans said it was just an attempt to distract from

failure : He lied so much , what were we supposed to do ?\nOf all the functions the January 6 committee is serving , the most crucial is to conclusively establish to as many members of the public as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not capricious , is not discretionary , but is an absolute moral imperative .\nPublic opinion , in this case , is a means to an end .\nThe end is getting Attorney General Merrick Garland to approve the criminal indictment of Trump and his top aides .\nThe committee doesn \u2019 t actually need to produce new evidence to accomplish that , although it doesn \u2019 t hurt

hearings are achieving .\nConsider , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 58 percent of Americans think Trump should be charged with a crime for his role in the riot , up from 52 percent in April .\nThen you get garbage like the Schmidt-Haberman piece , offering Garland an out .\nAnd the capper was the follow-up from the Times editorial pages : an op-ed headlined \u201c Prosecute Trump ?\nPut Yourself in Merrick Garland \u2019 s Shoes \u201d in which Republican lawyer Jack Goldsmith suggested that three easy , obvious decisions are somehow fraught .\nHaberman telegraphed the Timesian view -\u2013

, as I wrote a few months back , journalism \u2019 s devotion to accountability pretty much died last year .\nA party that violently attacked the government , attempted to steal a presidential

v. Wade is a shattering blow to women , as well as to anyone who believes that women should have the same rights and same autonomy over their bodies as men .\nIt is an enormous victory for the forces of authoritarianism and misogyny .\nStates will now punish women for having non-reproductive sex by forcing them , if they get pregnant , into involuntary servitude .\nIt is an augur of minority rule

been a lot of good opinion writing , \u201d Nancy MacLean , a scholar of the radical right at Duke University , told me in an interview .\n\u201c But in the mainstream media coverage , there \u2019 s a lot of both-sidesism : An attempt to be fair in a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the real stakes of the situation are.\n\u201d \u201c The mainstream media has bought into misogyny and sexism , \u201d Carrie Baker , a professor at Smith College , told me .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t even think it \u2019 s intentional misogyny and sexism , \u201d she said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s like unconscious bias .\nThey \u2019 re so used to prioritizing the worldviews of white people and men that to do other than that feels biased .\nIt infects the entire media.\n\u201d Mona Eltahawy , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it even more bluntly .\n\u201c What the U.S. media is incapable of doing is saying clearly that this is a white supremacist Christian movement driven by white supremacist , Christian zealots who are patriarchal to the core , \u201d she said .\n\u201c They \u2019 re tiptoeing around it , they don \u2019 t want to call them zealots , they don \u2019 t want to call it a theocracy , they don \u2019 t want to say they \u2019 re patriarchal , they don \u2019 t want to say they \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of this , mostly , because these are white Christian people , including white Christian women.\n\u201d So let \u2019 s take a look at what the feminists I interviewed , and whose work I read , believe is missing from the mainstream news coverage : \u201c We \u2019 re looking at women facing involuntary servitude to the state , \u201d said Nancy MacLean .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a war on women \u2014 in the context of a war on democracy.\n\u201c \u201c What \u2019 s missing from the press coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having power over women \u2019 s lives and destiny , \u201d said Jodi Jacobson , a journalist and longtime advocate of reproductive justice .\nThe hostility towards women is on full display on social media , Jacobson said .\n\u201c Basically , if you look at what these guys are saying online , they \u2019 re saying : \u2018 Your bodies are ours now \u2019 .\n\u201d Moira Donegan wrote in a stand-out Guardian column about the many , many things the story was not about ( but which the press is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u201c who was right and who was wrong \u201d ; \u201c the U.S. judiciary \u2019 s crumbling legitimacy \u201d ; and the \u201c vulgar \u201d question of \u201d what this withdrawal of human rights might mean for [ the Democratic ] party \u2019 s midterm election prospects.\n\u201d She added : \u201c The real story is not about the media who will churn out the think pieces , and the crass , enabling both-sidesism , and the insulting false equivalences and calls for unity.\n\u201d Then came this powerful conclusion : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own reality that journalist Molly Jong-Fast wrote : \u201c The idea that Roe was about anything other than power was so profoundly delusional that I felt like throwing my cellphone in Central Park \u2019 s Turtle Pond\u2026 After a weekend of seeing media outlets treat the loss of Roe like everything else , I wanted to write something about how it really feels to watch the rights of my sisters being taken away .\nI wanted to write something about how it feels to watch the conservative Supreme Court spit on us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I want to tell you that I hear you .\nI understand your rage , and I feel it too.\n\u201d \u201c The media misses the punitive impulse of the entire right-wing coalition , \u201d MacLean told me .\nAbortion wasn \u2019 t a major political issue until the early 1970s .\nIt wasn \u2019 t until \u201c it became associated with the woman \u2019 s movement and women \u2019 s freedom and autonomy \u201d that the right wingers turned so ferociously against it .\nTheir core credo , MacLean said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage in non-reproductive sex , and if they do , they should face the consequences.\n\u201d \u201c I have not heard one media outlet talk about the fact that this is part of a Christian nationalist agenda , \u201d Jodi Jacobson said .\n\u201c What I have heard is media outlet after media outlet putting on the same people who have lied us to this place.\n\u201d Civia Tamarkin , a filmmaker whose 2017 documentary \u201c Birthright : A War Story \u201d was about the right-wing war on women , told me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangers is \u201c missing the point , especially when they say \u2018 keep abortion safe \u2019 .\n\u201d \u201c It needs to be jail bars now , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Abortion is safe , but people are going to self-induce with medication and they \u2019 re going to be charged criminally .\nThey \u2019 re going to end up in jail.\n\u201d Tamarkin described her documentary as \u201c a real-life Handmaid \u2019 s Tale.\n\u201d Now we \u2019 re one big step closer to Gilead .\n\u201c The similarity is government-forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s what it \u2019 s all about , \u201d she said .\n\u201c \u2019 Handmaid \u2019 s Tale \u2019 is about a theocratic autocracy , and that \u2019 s exactly what we are living now.\n\u201d In the book , all-white Gilead is suffering from depopulation .\nIn the U.S. , Tamarkin said , the equivalent is \u201c the white nationalist fear of \u2018 replacement \u2019 .\n\u201d Replacement theory has recently made a huge public resurgence in the right-wing media .\nIt stipulates that Western elites , manipulated by Jews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to replace white voters in order to achieve their social and political goals , which ultimately include the extinction of the white race .\nThe anti-abortion movement \u2014 at least in part \u2014 \u201c is very much about maintaining white supremacy in a time of a dwindling white population , \u201d said Carrie Baker .\nBut , I asked , won \u2019 t an abortion ban also lead to more nonwhite babies ?\n\u201d They can disenfranchise people of color , \u201d Baker said .\n\u201c But they need more white bodies.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what this means for women \u2019 s basic equality , \u201d Caroline Fredrickson , a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice , told me .\n\u201c Controlling reproduction is what has enabled women any facsimile of equal status.\n\u201d Fredrickson said that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen \u2019 s comment in May should have gotten more press coverage .\nYellen told a congressional committee : \u201c I believe that eliminating the right of women to make decisions about when and whether to have children would have very damaging effects on the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fredrickson said the economy \u201c depends on women \u2019 s liberty , and women \u2019 s liberty depends on bodily autonomy as well as significant investments in family supports .\n\u201c Only if we see how women are hampered in having a truly fair playing field in the economic sphere will we recognize the true burden of forced parenting \u2014 and parenting without social and financial supports , \u201d Fredrickson said .\nAmanda Marcotte wrote a powerful piece in Salon casting the decision as \u201c a malignant minority imposing an authoritarian will on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roe isn \u2019 t just a tragedy for human rights , \u201d she wrote .\n\u201c It \u2019 s the surest sign yet that American democracy is collapsing , and Republicans are securing the ability to force the majority of Americans that keep voting against them to live under minority rule.\n\u201d Similarly , Nancy MacLean mocked the view that \u201c Oh we \u2019 re not taking away this fundamental right , we \u2019 re just giving it back to the states.\n\u201d With the Supreme Court \u2019 s blessing , Republicans who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and passed laws that make it almost impossible for Democrats to win even with a majority of the votes .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a fiction to say that somehow democracy is operating at the state level , \u201d MacLean said .\n\u201c We \u2019 re not going to be able to fix this because we no longer have operative democracies.\n\u201d \u201c I think that what is bad about the media coverage right now is that it is acting as if there are both sides to science and to medicine , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Students for Choice , said in an interview .\n\u201c They don \u2019 t do that with any other area of medicine , \u201d she said .\n\u201c I would like to see the press cover some of the outrageous claims about abortion the same way they covered the use of dog de-wormer to treat Covid , \u201d she said .\n\u201c They don \u2019 t take that kind of aggressive stance \u201d when it comes to anti-abortion conspiracy theories , she said .\nAbortion is safe .\nIt is significantly safer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s also common ( as well as popular . )\nJournalists shouldn \u2019 t attribute those facts as if they were opinions .\n( It \u2019 s like climate change that way . )\n\u201c It is more common than major dental surgery in this country , \u201d Merritt said .\n\u201c One out of three or four people capable of pregnancy get an abortion , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Just look at the numbers.\n\u201d The anti-abortion movement is a huge , well-funded machine , underwritten by billionaires like Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not grandmas out in front of a clinic , \u201d Merritt said .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t appreciate reading articles that make it sound like the pro-abortion and reproductive rights movement lost to a bunch of grandmas in front of clinics .\nWe lost to a well-funded , coordinated national campaign that doesn \u2019 t have to address any dissent in their ranks.\n\u201d The Role of the Catholic Church There \u2019 s been little if anything in the news about the role of the American Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carrie Baker believes its role is central , and sinister .\n\u201c The architect of the anti-abortion movement in the U.S. is the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops , \u201d she said .\n\u201c The Catholic Church has bankrolled this movement .\nThey bankrolled the packing of the court.\n\u201d All six justices who concurred in the Dobbs opinion were raised Catholic .\nAnd Baker said it is not a coincidence that the church also has a long and sordid history of condoning pedophilia and sexual abuse of parishioners by priests .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides of one coin , \u201d she said .\n\u201c And that coin is misogyny.\n\u201d Women are notoriously excluded from the Catholic hierarchy .\n\u201c They want to keep women subordinate , \u201d Baker said .\n\u201c I think they want to continue the sexual abuses of women and children , \u201d she said .\n\u201c How else do we make sense of this confluence of events ?\nI think it \u2019 s a fundamentally corrupt institution that wants to maintain its power , to be able to take sexual advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are in Denial One reason the news stories you \u2019 re reading and hearing are insufficiently cataclysmic about the extent to which this is an attack on women and a move toward authoritarian theocracy is that the people reporters normally call for comment aren \u2019 t talking like that either .\n\u201c None of the major pro-choice groups , of which I am no longer a fan , are framing it that way , \u201d said Jacobson .\nAnd while news reporters reflexively turned to Democratic leaders to find out what \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that those Democratic leaders just don \u2019 t get it .\n\u201c Aside from a very vocal progressive segment , Democrats from President Biden on down have uttered their disdain but frankly , they are devoid of the anger and passion that this perilous moment demands , \u201d independent journalist Nida Khan wrote on Medium .\nIndeed , the White House appears to be trying hard to make the overturning of Roe into an \u201c everyone \u201d issue , with President Biden , for instance , stressing \u201c the broader right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s about women .\nThe top issue for Democratic leaders right now is the midterm elections , not women .\nSo leadership on this issue will have to be found elsewhere .\nWhat are some of the essential paragraphs of context missing from new stories about the overturning of Roe ?\nTamarkin answered : \u201c I would put in there that this is not about abortion , this is about control and power and the intersectionality of racism , sexism and classism by a fearful white nationalist portion of the country that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and state and create an autocratic theocracy .\nIt \u2019 s not about controlling pregnancy , it \u2019 s about controlling the population demographics here .\nIt \u2019 s about suppressing people of color and a return to the enslavement that comes with economic subjugation.\n\u201d Merritt said articles should stipulate \u201c that abortion is incredibly safe .\nIt is the most regulated medical procedure in any state in the U.S. That abortion is common , and that bodily autonomy is fundamentally a human right .\nI would also add that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the pill back in the bottle .\nWhat we \u2019 re really talking about is sending people who are capable of pregnancy to jail.\n\u201d Write More Like This I \u2019 ll end by expressing appreciation and quoting for one excellent piece in the New York Times on Wednesday by Julie Bosman , who wrote : One article like this isn \u2019 t nearly enough , though .\nThat every woman has had her citizenship degraded and that the forces of autocratic theocracy have triumphed is

arguing that the \u201c far left \u201d is denying women their humanity as much as the \u201c far right \u201d \u2013 based on the fact that a handful of people are trying to use more inclusive language to acknowledge that trans men can get pregnant , too .\nBut that , of course , is exactly what the editors of the New York Times opinion section chose to do on Saturday , running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Far Left Agree on One Thing : Women Don \u2019 t Count , \u201d by their newly-minted columnist Pamela Paul , the former Book Review editor who apparently was brought over to opinion primarily to troll the libs .\nBoth-sidesing would have been a step up for this column , which devoted only 52 words out of 1,300 to the right \u2019 s decades-long campaign to strip women of their rights .\nThe rest was about how \u201c the fringe left \u201d is \u201c jumping in with its own perhaps unintentionally but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Paul \u2019 s argument was an exaggerated summary of a scaremonger news article from last month by Michael Powell , one of the two star reporters the Times has assigned to the woke-panic/cancel-culture beat \u2013the other being Anemona Hartocollis , who just a few days ago gave us this already infamous piece of soft-focus cancel porn .\nPowell , Paul wrote , had concluded that \u201c the word \u2018 women \u2019 has become verboten.\n\u201d In reality , some groups , sometimes , use gender-neutral language because , as NARAL explained ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) \u201c it \u2019 s not just cis-gender women that can get pregnant and give birth\u2026 We \u2019 re being inclusive .\nIt \u2019 s that simple.\n\u201d But nobody is eliminating the word woman .\nThat is incontrovertibly bullshit .\nSo why write such a thing ?\nWhy publish it ?\nAs it happens , I ask myself those questions a lot these days .\nOur most elite media outlets \u2013 the Times , the Washington Post , the Atlantic , among others \u2013 seem to be constantly running articles that cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society equal or greater than an extremist political party that is quickly and effectively eroding American human rights , free speech , and democracy .\nWell , I \u2019 ve seen enough .\nI have answers .\nWhat all these articles reflect is an intense , disproportionate hostility toward inclusiveness .\nSo the answer is right there : The purveyors of this garbage are defending exclusivity .\nThey are , or they identify with , rich white cis people who want to maintain their position of control and power and superiority over others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hippies who would upset the proper order of things .\n* There \u2019 s currently no acceptable way of openly expressing that view in polite , elite society .\nSo all the emotional intensity \u2013 and money \u2013 behind it gets poured into this insane bucket of anti-wokeism .\nThat \u2019 s why , for instance , you have people like Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos reportedly bringing up in conversations with executive-editor job candidates \u201c his distaste for cancel culture.\n\u201d It \u2019 s an acceptable way of saying \u201c Don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People obsessed with the dangers of wokeism are , in a word , assholes .\nThey are oppressors who want to come off as martyrs .\nThey are the leaders who want to shut up the rabble .\nMany are racists , misogynists and/or homophobes who want to make themselves sound noble .\nAnd casting wokeism as a malevolent force has a particular appeal for political journalists , for at least two reasons .\nOne is that they are pathologically committed to remaining \u201c above the fray \u201d even as one political party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hostility to democratic institutions .\nThis way , they can leave the false impression \u201c that the radicalization happening in the American right has some kind of corollary in the left , \u201d as columnist Moira Donegan expressed it .\nIt \u2019 s a way of assuaging the right .\nThe other is that it \u2019 s a great way of marginalizing critical readers : \u201c Oh , that \u2019 s just the woke mob.\n\u201d Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. , declared in 2017 that the paper didn \u2019 t need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social media now served \u201c as a modern watchdog , \u201d and that it was the organization \u2019 s \u201c responsibility.. to empower all of those watchdogs , and to listen to them.\n\u201d Whining about omnipresent wokeism effectively belayed that order .\nIt \u2019 s also a scam : a great way to get attention and money .\nTop cancel-culture warriors have found a way to get paid by other assholes while still smirking at themselves in the mirror every morning .\nWhether it \u2019 s Bari Weiss or FIRE , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inclusiveness is a cash cow .\nAnti-wokeism is a safe harbor among intellectuals for those who have rebranded their desire to discriminate as religious liberty .\nSure , there are occasional excesses of woke fervor on the left .\nBut does any rational person actually believe that wokeism is anywhere near as significant a force in our society as racism , misogyny and homophobia ?\nI don \u2019 t think so .\nI think it \u2019 s all about signaling and trolling and negating .\nIt \u2019 s not vaguely sincere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perceived threat .\nAnd journalists wo play along are blowing a right-wing dog whistle , just like they did before with \u201c critical race theory , \u201d \u201c migrant caravans , \u201d and \u201c death panels.\n\u201d Casting wokeism \u2013 literally , the awakening to social problems \u2013 as malevolent also does exactly what its critics accuse it of doing : It shuts down criticism , debate , and even basic self-awareness .\nDid no one in the New York Times opinion section raise a concern that Paul \u2019 s column might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were they scared to ?\nOr do the folks in the opinion section express a \u201c distaste for cancel culture \u201d because their owner \u2013 like the guy at the Washington Post \u2013 wants them to and rewards them for it ?\nI suspect there \u2019 s at least some of the latter going on , because some of what goes on over there is too stupid to explain in any other way than that they are flailing around , with no actual moral compass , without their brains really engaged , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants them to .\nWhat else besides a powerful directive to present \u201c both sides \u201d so completely overcomes intellectual rigor ?\nThe controversy over the publication of an inaccurate , unhinged and inflammatory op-ed by Tom Cotton during the Black Lives Matter summer showed how rightist opinion had a fast-track to publishing under then-editorial page editor James Bennet .\nBut it may be even worse under his successor , Kathleen Kingsbury .\nShe actually published a blitheringly stupid lead editorial just four months ago bemoaning cancel culture and asserting that \u201c Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as citizens of a free country : the right to speak their minds and voice their opinions in public without fear of being shamed or shunned.\n\u201d There is no such right .\nShe had it exactly wrong .\nAs I wrote at the time , the fundamental right is to be able to engage in spirited debate without government intervention \u2014 which often includes shaming , if not shunning .\nThere is no right not to be ratioed on Twitter .\nApparently , in Kingsbury \u2019 s mind , holding the powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day after Kingsbury published Paul , she published a guest essay by Leah Libresco Sargeant that included discussion about \u201c delivering a baby who is ectopic.\n\u201d But there is no such thing .\nAn ectopic pregnancy is always fatal to the fetus .\nIt \u2019 s an outrageous lie .\nEven a cursory edit would have caught that .\nAnd while Times columnists and guest essayists from the right evidently get little to no scrutiny from the editors , I \u2019 m increasingly hearing that essays from the left are subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editors trying to denature them .\nYou go down that path and you end up publishing idiot arguments like that no one is allowed to say \u201c woman \u201d anymore .\nAnd Paul \u2019 s essay was dangerous as well as dumb .\nIt \u2019 s not just that she equated a real threat to women with a bunch of tweets .\nShe also attacked people and groups for acknowledging the existence of trans men .\nPaul \u2019 s imagined indignities to women from the left are actually being suffered by trans people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs Medill journalism professor Steven Thrasher wrote in a tweet , Paul \u2019 s column has \u201c opened the Overton window and given permission to respectable white liberals to be openly transphobic.\n\u201d There is an actual movement that would deny trans people their humanity .\nIt is not cis women who are being \u201c told we couldn \u2019 t call ourselves women anymore.\n\u201d Here \u2019 s my take on what \u2019 s happening in a lot of elite journalism : When everything you do is performative rather than sincere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid things because it \u2019 s much harder to keep track of what you \u2019 re supposed to believe than what you believe .\nSo write what you believe is true , not what you think will please your bosses , or an imaginary white male reader , or the right , which will never be happy as long as you write the truth .\nPunch up , not down .\nAnd embrace inclusivity .\n* OK there \u2019 s one possible exception : People who are doing it just to get attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks who shared their thoughts on Twitter .", "author":

ago : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who fear for democracy ?\nWhy has the majority been silenced ?\nWhat has occurred to me since then is that the corporate media needs \u2013 and is missing \u2014 someone they can turn to for a few pithy soundbites .\nActually talking to a wide cross-section of people is way too much work .\nOur top political reporters , when news happens , reach out to the usual suspects : the people who either lead our political parties or are jockeying for position .\nSometimes they \u2019 ll reach out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut top politicians have their own motives , and calculations , and habits .\nThe decrepit leaders of the Democratic Party are stunted by pro-corporate incrementalism and timidity .\nThe leaders of the Republican Party are psychotic liars .\nAnyone looking for someone to express unbridled passion and outrage will not find it in politics \u2013 except in some very rare cases .\nSo who could become the voice of people ?\nWho could journalists reasonably turn to who could express the common-sense outrage about the direction our country is going in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions ?\nWho could explain to reporters \u2013 who either don \u2019 t get it , or forget all the time \u2013 what is really at stake ?\nWho could cut through the Republican talking points and scare stories and explain , simply and clearly , what the right-wing zealots who control that party want to do ?\nWho could expose how the current system serves the rich ?\nWho can be said to represent this huge , highly alarmed chunk of the public ?\nAnd who can channel this supermajority \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a true public agenda ?\nI \u2019 m personally at the point where I think we need some sort of national strike , to definitively establish that the status quo is not acceptable .\nBut who could call one ?\nI don \u2019 t know .\nMy personal list of people I look to for moral leadership includes civil rights lawyer Sherilyn Ifill , co-chair of the Poor People \u2019 s Campaign the Rev .\nWilliam Barber II , and a few particularly plain-speaking populist politicians including Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of great responses .\nBut are any of them viable ?\nThe cynic in me says our culture is so fractured and debased that it has to be a celebrity .\nThey are the only ones who seem to attract truly mass support .\nWhat about Oprah ?\nOr Barack Obama ?\nOr Michelle Obama ?\nOr can it be some sort of network of influential people united not by party lines , but by core values ?\nWhat about non-billionaire-run philanthropy ?\nIt \u2019 s been interesting to watch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of days , gain awareness of the craving for a fighter .\nFirst came opinion writers Paul Waldman and Greg Sargent , who wrote : They wrote that they saw signs that California Gov .\nGavin Newson might be trying to fill that vaccum .\nThen came reporters Ashley Parker and Matt Viser , adding J.B. Pritzker , Illinois \u2019 Democratic governor , to the mix .\nThey wrote : But it \u2019 s not just \u201c Democrats \u201d who feel this way .\nI think it \u2019 s \u201c ordinary Americans.\n@ @ @

bandied about by Trump loyalists and enablers , as they desperately try to persuade Attorney General Merrick Garland that indicting Trump would be a political act rather than a legal and moral imperative .\nTo the extent that this reasoning has any currency whatsoever , it is in large part the fault of our top political journalists and their pathetic , spineless coverage of Trump \u2019 s campaign , presidency , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these journalists refused to use the word \u201c lie \u201d at all \u2013 based on what they said was uncertainty about whether Trump had the intent to deceive .\nAnd then , even after they acknowledged that he clearly knew what he was doing \u2014 and they started calling his lies lies \u2014 they didn \u2019 t explain his motivation for lying .\nThey didn \u2019 t call out the simple truth that Trump was always lying for a reason \u2014 that there was a specific intent behind each and every lie .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d behind the lie is a chronic media malady . )\nJust look at how Trump dealt with Covid .\nHe lied that it wasn \u2019 t a problem , he lied that he had a plan , he lied about testing , he lied that bleach would help , he lied that it was going away .\nWhy ?\nBecause he really believed those things at the time ?\nHardly .\nHe desperately wanted people to believe he was competent , in control , and yet not responsible for so much death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked . )\nThe idea that because Trump lied so much you can \u2019 t say for sure what he really believed has it exactly backwards : His lies were incredibly revealing .\nThey told you exactly what he wanted to happen \u2013 or to make happen .\nPolitical reporters never really considered that at the time .\nThey repeated his lies , sometimes skeptically and sometimes not .\nThose lies made great copy and got them on TV if they weren \u2019 t on TV already .\nThose lies made them successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great job .\nBut having acknowledged that Trump was telling falsehoods , intentionally , the next question reporters should have explored and explained was : To what end ?\nHe used them to take credit and avoid blame .\nHe used them to make himself look good when he was bad .\nHe used them to bully people into doing what he wanted .\nHe lied about measurable things , like his golf game and the size of his crowds .\nHe lied about everything .\nBut he didn \u2019 t lie randomly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to save someone else embarrassment .\nHe lied to get his way and to feel better about himself .\nWhen political journalists felt particularly daring , they mocked Trump a bit , or slyly hinted that some people said he was delusional .\nBut they overlooked the crucial truth that his lies always served his interests .\nSo you could his derive his interests from his lies .\nThink about it : Reporters never pressed him to explain why he was lying \u2014 a huge mistake , rooted in cowardice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surprise , then , that one of the most overt and egregious embraces of this ridiculous notion \u2014 that Trump \u2019 s \u201c continued stream of falsehoods highlights some of the complexities of pursuing any criminal case against him \u201d \u2014 came from none other than Michael Schmidt and Maggie Haberman of the New York Times , in their article last month headlined \u201c Despite Growing Evidence , a Prosecution of Trump Would Face Challenges.\n\u201d It continues , however , even though most of the looming charges of obstruction , sedition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even require a finding of intent .\nAs Ryan Goodman , Norman Eisen and Barbara McQuade wrote in a Washington Post op-ed , \u201c Vigilante justice is against the law , even if you ( wrongly ) believe you are a victim.\n\u201d But even in regards to criminal charges that do require proof of intent , the lies have it .\nJust Security , the brilliant national security website , has been routinely churning out unparalleled resources on the Jan. 6 attack , and it just published a new report meticulously chronicling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump election lies \u2013 alongside the ample evidence that he absolutely knew they weren \u2019 t true .\nSo , for instance , Trump repeatedly claimed , in regard to voting fraud conspiracy theories , that then-attorney general Bill Barr \u201c hasn \u2019 t done anything , so he hasn \u2019 t looked.\n\u201d By contrast , as the Jan. 6 committee has so clearly established , \u201c Trump knew that the DOJ had taken extraordinary action to investigate allegations of fraud but found no evidence of widespread fraud.\n\u201d He even expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOJ officials.\n\u201d Why did he lie ?\nThat \u2019 s not a hard one : He wanted the Justice Department to find evidence , so he lied and said they hadn \u2019 t looked .\nThe \u201c Big Lie \u201d is the most revealing of all .\nTrump wanted to keep being president .\nHe didn \u2019 t want to admit he lost .\nEverything he said was in the pursuit of that goal .\nAnd far from suggesting possible innocence , Trump \u2019 s lies actually add heft to the charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , juries are often instructed that they can consider false statements as indications of consciousness of guilt .\nThat you lied makes you more guilty , not less .\nHistory will judge the press under Trump very poorly , in large part because what our top political journalists never really grasped \u2013 and certainly didn \u2019 t tell their readers and viewers \u2013 is that Trump would say anything \u2014 anything at all \u2014 to get his way .\nAll Trump

a longer , reported article , among other lousy excuses .\nI have , however , continued to post frequently on Twitter , growing more frustrated , angrier , and more frantic almost every day .\nThe January 6 committee hearings gave the political media the grist it needed \u2014 and a great big shove \u2013 to acknowledge , once and for all , that the leader of the dominant wing of the Republican Party incited and encouraged an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But after a day or two ( if that ) of not both-sidesing the threat to democracy posed by the GOP , it was back to the broken , inadequate normal for the

twittersphere .\nBut I \u2019 ve been wondering if -\u2013 just as I did with the items I collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House Watch column for the Washington Post many years ago -\u2013 I could create a whole that is greater than the sum of the parts .\nIn others words , if I looked through a day or a week \u2019 s worth of tweets , would I pull out themes that deserved more attention and a longer shelf life ?\nSo as an experiment , I went through the last four weeks of tweets to test my hypothesis .\nRead on and tell me if you think it \u2019 s worth doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the January 6 Committee Doing the Media \u2019 s Job The January 6 committee exposed not just Trump \u2019 s conspiracy to steal the election , but the media \u2019 s conspiracy of silence .\nThe last two hearings were really extraordinary : I thought reporters made a mistake when they wrote up non-responsive talking points from Republicans whingeing about how the hearings weren \u2019 t fair .\nThey should have asked : One of the achievements of the hearings was to take us back to a moment where everyone knew things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican leadership : And it reminded us that , in real time , neither Trump nor anyone else knew how it would turn out .\nThe committee did a great job , but inevitably left many leads for journalists to pursue .\nInstead , some reporters turned to whining : The central if unstated purpose of the hearings has been to prod the Department of Justice to indict Trump and his cronies .\nUnfortunately , as I wrote here , the \u201c democracy teams \u201d at our major news organizations are way outnumbered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Politico doesn \u2019 t even have a democracy team .\nI think this is all very calculated : And soon enough , reporters went right back to centering their coverage around Trump , his base , and their reaction .\nIt \u2019 s important to keep in mind that \u2014 with the exception of a few details about just how childish Trump was when the Secret Service told him he couldn \u2019 t go to the Capitol after his speech \u2014 there has been no substantial pushback from anyone about any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , there are a bunch of books ( and excerpts from books ) coming out , but they are mostly full of gossip that makes whichever sources were most obliging to the authors look good \u2014 rather than answering the many still outstanding questions .\nHow did the media miss all this stuff in real time ?\nThe answer , I think , is that this was all a game for our top political journalists , who were competing for attention when they should have been crusading for the truth .\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss .\nBut when they got a \u201c scoop \u201d , they turned it into ephemeral clickbait .\nAxios , for instance , had written about the \u201c unhinged \u201d meeting Trump held with crackpots on Dec. 18 , 2020 that was treated like a major bombshell after the July 12 hearing .\nTrump \u2019 s attempt to steal the election was fully apparent to reporters \u2014 I would argue as early as September 2020 .\nIt was certainly obvious well before Election Day , and all the way through Jan. 6 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ indefensible things he did , he announced his intention ahead of time .\nSo it \u2019 s not wrong to treat this as big news now .\nIt was , it is , and it will be big news .\nBut it also goes to show the media \u2019 s abysmal failure to express sufficient alarm that certain things it discovered got the attention they needed .\nIt was all just noise to a media ecosystem that was too scared to pull the emergency brake .\nOn the Media Rooting for Garland to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the serving of a search warrant at Trump \u2019 s Palm Beach home to seize documents he absconded with from the White House does not actually cast any more light on whether Attorney General Merrick Garland will approve an indictment of Trump based on inciting insurrection .\nIt did , however , elicit from shockingly bad takes : How is the larger investigation going ?\nThe New York Times ran an attention-getting article in July suggesting that the department was only now , for the first time , \u201c discussing the topic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article was a journalistic shitshow .\nSo basically we \u2019 re supposed to take an anonymous Lisa Monaco \u2019 s word for the fact that DOJ wasn \u2019 t \u201c talking about it \u201d until after the committee hearings ?\nSeriously ?\nOn the Failure to Call Out the Crazy But instead , even when they explicitly write about the potential for anti-democratic violence , reporters consistently leave out the essential context .\nNew York Times columnist Paul Krugman thinks he knows why : The job of the media is simple : to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Failure to Explain What \u2019 s at Stake As I wrote a while back , the goal of a responsible news organization is not to get people to vote a specific way .\nBut it is to make sure that everyone understands what \u2019 s at stake .\nBut our elite political reporters seem incapable of doing this .\nThey know , for instance , that a Trump candidacy would be dangerous , and another presidency would be cataclysmic .\nBut they treat it like just another spectacle .\nHe still rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican agenda is toxic to most Americans .\nThat \u2019 s giving them credit for having an agenda at all : They should be asking why the Republican Party is even competitive given its extremism and conspiracy theories .\nAnd they should be saying this is not OK : When their task is clear : Everything is Bad News for Biden Part of it is that they adopt a Republicans frame for the narrative : All of Biden \u2019 s victories are fleeting , and there \u2019 s always another shoe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of the media narrative in driving down Biden \u2019 s support : They refuse to consider that some of the Biden disapproval is from the left , and does not translate to support for the GOP : Then they put every policy or electoral battle in the context of Biden \u2019 s approval ratings : Political reporters at our elite news organizations found themselves incapable of accurately reporting on the transparently venal motives of Sens .\nJoe Manchin and Krysten Sinema in blocking passage of Biden \u2019 s biggest policy proposals : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still shockingly anodyne : On the Heroes and the Goats I read some great stuff over the last four weeks .\nAnd some awful stuff .\nThree Washington Post stories stood out \u2014 none of them by political reporters .\nSo kudos to the Post \u2019 s

\u2013 temporarily , I hope \u2013 of one of its chief scourges .\nStelter , who hosted CNN \u2019 s influential weekly media roundup , \u201c Reliable Sources , \u201d was one of the few \u201c mainstream media \u201d figures who had no patience for Fox and the rest of the right-wing propaganda machine .\nIn his book \u201c Hoax \u201d , on his show , and in his must-read daily newsletter , Stelter called Fox out for spreading malicious lies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , of course .\nAnd they hated him for it .\nFox anchors in particular were obsessed with him \u2014 often in a disgusting , personal way .\nThey made fun of his looks .\nSean Hannity called him a \u201c fake news Humpty Dumpty.\n\u201d At a time when misinformation and disinformation have become weaponized against pluralism and even democracy , succumbing to Fox and its ilk is tremendously dangerous .\nAt a time when media framing is so important , getting rid of Stelter and his show is a massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CNN , far from offering any defensible reason for axing Stelter , has given every indication they fired him precisely because he was the right-wing propaganda machine \u2019 s number one target .\nJohn Malone , the cable oligarch and a powerful investor in Warner Brothers Discovery Inc. , which now owns CNN , telegraphed it all last fall when he said on CNBC that he wanted CNN to \u201c evolve back to the kind of journalism that it started with and , you know , actually have journalists.\n\u201d By contrast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual journalists.\n\u201d The media coverage of CNN \u2019 s new management plans didn \u2019 t help \u2013 it was more voyeuristic than concerned .\nAxios , for instance , helped put a target on Stelter \u2019 s back ( and reporter Jim Acosta \u2019 s ) , by noting that \u201c To conservative critics , some on-air personalities , like Jim Acosta and Brian Stelter , have become the face of the network \u2019 s liberal shift.\n\u201d I would argue that neither upsets \u201c conservative critics \u201d because they are \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Stelter ( and Acosta ) have at times refused to grace outrageous lies with the credulity of many other members of the press corps .\nThat \u2019 s not liberal or conservative \u2013that \u2019 s caring about what \u2019 s true .\nSo Stelter \u2019 s firing was essentially a peace offering from CNN to the know-nothing MAGA mob .\nBut it \u2019 s not going to work .\nThey \u2019 ll never be satisfied .\nAnd according to the Daily Beast , CNN \u2019 s new head , Chris Licht , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be more changes and you might not understand it or like it all.\n\u201d The greater tragedy here is that this suggests CNN is moving in precisely the opposite direction than it should .\nThere is a lot structurally wrong with CNN today \u2013 most notably its dependence on talking heads who never change their mind \u2013 but the answer is not to shy away from truth-telling .\nIt shouldn \u2019 t become more like Fox , it should proudly be the anti-Fox .\nI \u2019 ve previously outlined my vision for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most trusted name in news.\n\u201d It doesn \u2019 t mean becoming more \u201c centrist \u201d \u2013 with the center skewed by the conspiracy theories of right-wing extremists .\nAnd there \u2019 s a business case for all this .\nA reality-based news network will never be able to satisfy Americans whose view of themselves depends on falsely demonizing others .\nBut according to Nielsen , more Democrats aged 25 to 54 watch Fox than watch CNN or MSNBC .\nAmericans today suffer from not having a common frame of reference , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish and champion that frame , telling viewers what they need to know , while expressing righteous indignation toward the spreaders of disinformation and intolerance .\nStelter had his blind spots , including a gigantic one for his own network .\nThen again , he wouldn \u2019 t have lasted as long as he did otherwise .\nAnd over the years , he impressed me time and again , particularly when he issued clarion calls for , in his words , \u201c clear-eyed no nonsense news coverage.\n\u201d When Trump was constantly lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply doing stenography , even though it was killing people , Stelter said on his show : He did a wonderful segment in May 2021 about why American newsrooms need a \u201c democracy beat.\n\u201d Talking about his book in September 2020 on PBS , he nailed it : \u201c Fox is like resentment news .\nIt is like grievance news .\nIt taps into white Christian Americans \u2019 grievances about what is happening in the country , an increasingly multicultural America.\n\u201d We need more journalists , not fewer , to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as not journalism .\nStelter is a unique figure , arguably one of the hardest-working people in the business , and a phenom who hustled his way onto the New York Times from a blog he wrote from his dorm room in college .\nPresumably he \u2019 ll find a new platform soon .\nIn the meantime , he has been silenced .\nAnd that says a lot more about the people now running CNN than it says about him .\nBeing a media critic within the corporate media is fraught , suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why Press Watch is independent \u2013 surviving solely on individual and philanthropic contributions .", "author": "Dan Froomkin", "url":

has a diversity problem", "content": "My take on the New York Times newsroom is that it is increasingly riven .\nOn one side : Top management and the old guard , who continue to enforce a dominant but senescent white culture of both-sidesism and comfort with the status quo .\nOn the other side : Younger and more diverse staffers , along with some older and whiter supporters , whose lived experiences tell them that dramatic societal change is necessary , and who believe their calling is to the truth even if the truth is one-sided .\nSo new evidence out today that New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversity in its newsroom , but actively devalues it , didn \u2019 t surprise me at all .\nMaybe a little more surprising was learning that management \u2019 s response to persistent concerns about racial disparities in performance ratings was to hire a consultant who covered up those disparities with bad statistical methods .\nThe new evidence is from an analysis by Times journalists in the NewsGuild of New York , the union that represents the Times newsroom .\nThe Guild , which includes vocal supporters of both sides of the \u201c both-sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new contract with Times executives .\nIts new report concluded that the Times \u201c has for years given significantly lower ratings to employees of color.\n\u201d The Guild \u201c found that in 2021 , being Hispanic reduced the odds of receiving a high score by about 60 percent , and being Black cut the chances of high scores by nearly 50 percent .\nAsians were also less likely than white employees to get high scores .\nIn 2020 , zero Black employees received the highest rating , while white employees accounted for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who received the top score.\n\u201d Those ratings send a message .\n\u201c Guild members who believed their contributions weren \u2019 t fairly rated in the review process have said they feel demoralized and alienated \u2014 a pernicious outcome as The Times attempts to recruit and retain a diverse workforce.\n\u201d The Guild report \u2013 charitably , I think \u2013 stopped short of accusing management of systemic racism : But I find it hard to believe that it \u2019 s a coincidence .\nWhat I see is plenty of evidence that top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many other news organizations , see increased diversity as a potential threat to their values .\nThis explains their wild over-reaction to what has been pejoratively labeled \u201c wokeism \u201d , but is really an attempt to treat everyone with the same respect accorded to the white cis majority .\nThe undue obsession with \u201c cancel culture \u201d can be seen in the newsroom , where at least one marquee reporter ( Michael Powell ) is wholly devoted to writing \u201c woke panic \u201d scare stories , and on the opinion side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pamela Paul and John McWhorter ) are doing likewise .\nIndeed , according to the New York Times editorial board , it is a \u201c fundamental right \u201d not to be \u201c shamed or shunned \u201d no matter what you stand for .\nThe Times \u2019 s resistance to change has long been evident in statements from Dean Baquet , who recently stepped down as executive editor ( only to be replaced by his loyal deputy , Joe Kahn . )\nBaquet said in a New Yorker interview in February that he values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if , in return , they adopt his notion of journalistic objectivity : He contrasted the \u201c demands \u201d of the \u201c next generation of Black journalists \u201d to his duty to \u201c make sure that the New York Times is a fair-minded institution , \u201d on the other .\n\u201c I have to protect the place .\nI have to make it better , but also sometimes resist the things that they want to change because I think those things are important to the core , \u201d he said .\nIn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger , Black reporter Wesley Lowery \u2019 s seminal Times op-ed calling for greater \u201c moral clarity \u201d \u2014 for instance by no longer \u201c reflexively hiding behind euphemisms that obfuscate the truth.\n\u201d \u201c I have to protect the place , \u201d Baquet said .\n\u201c I have to make it better , but also sometimes resist the things that they want to change because I think those things are important to the core.\n\u201d The Times is hardly alone .\nAs I wrote in my 2019 primer on journalism and race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American newsrooms remains intractably white and male , dooming their ability to see how race and racism are central to the political divide in our country .\nA spokeswoman for the Times told NPR \u2019 s David Folkenflik that the company has taken the Guild \u2019 s concerns seriously , but that it evaluated similar objections a year ago and found no bias .\nThe Guild raised serious doubts about that evaluation , however .\nThe Times refused to hand over a copy .\nAnd one of the outside experts to whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach replied , \u201c That \u2019 s what you would do if you want to obliterate signal.\n\u201d Will the younger and more diverse staffers eventually succeed the current generation of managers ?\nI certainly hope so .\nBut it won \u2019 t happen if they get driven out

his allies in furtherance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mendacity match and surpass Trump \u2019 s .\nHe doesn \u2019 t just insult people who disagree with him , he accuses them of wanting to sexualize kindergartners .\nHe has weaponized cis white grievance .\nHe has turned the schools into the battlefield of his culture wars , signing laws to censor teachers from talking openly about gender

@ @ @ @ mandate efore the 2022 USA games in Orlando .\nHe has impaneled his own redneck grand jury to criminally charge sanctuary cities .\nHe drew a new congressional-district map so that Republicans could win 70 percent of House seats in a state where the voters are almost evenly divided .\nA federal judge recently enjoined one of his new laws , calling it an attempt to turn the \u201c First Amendment upside down.\n\u201d He is following the trail blazed by Victor Orb\u00e1n , who has turned Hungary into a dictatorship .\nDeSantis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government in Florida .\nThere is nobody in the state willing and able to hold him accountable .\nThe Miami Herald editorial board calls it \u201c unchecked one-man rule.\n\u201d Trump is a Trumpist .\nBut DeSantis is a fascist .\nAnd he is gaming political journalists just like Trump did in 2016 .\nHe is counting on mainstream journalists , once again , being so desperate to cast themselves as \u201c impartial \u201d that they will normalize what is effectively 21st-century American fascism .\nDeSantis has learned he can get away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how deceitful .\nRather than holding him accountable , political reporters praise his strategy .\nSure , our major news organizations run the occasional story pointing out who he really is .\nBut what DeSantis is exploiting is the \u201c both-sides \u201d political media \u2019 s inability to sustain outrage against one side , no matter how extremist and authoritarian it becomes .\nSo the unthinkable \u2013 laws that criminalize constitutionally protected speech or punish a company that publicly disagrees with him \u2014 is a big deal for a few days , winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news .\nThe outrage ebbs , so by definition it \u2019 s not outrageous any more .\nAnd then , for political reporters , it \u2019 s back to horserace coverage , where every horse has to be given a fair shot \u2014 where politics has no right or wrong , just who \u2019 s winning and how they \u2019 re doing it .\nEvery time any fact-based , democracy-loving journalist refers to Ron DeSantis , it is their moral obligation to warn readers and viewers that he is an authoritarian , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination \u2013 and simply identifying him as conservative , or maybe controversial , is not enough .\nIt \u2019 s journalistic malpractice .\nCan any reporter honestly say that an introductory clause stating that DeSantis \u201c raised his national profile over his handling of the pandemic and is widely considered a potential 2024 presidential candidate \u201d ( Wall Street Journal ) or \u201c has relished stoking cultural battles , even going to war with Disney , a storied company with deep ties to his state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adequate summary of who he is and how he would govern ?\nDeSantis is a great topic for news stories .\nBut those stories shouldn \u2019 t be about his poll numbers , his \u201c electability , \u201d or how he would fare against Trump , or Biden .\nThey should be about how some Republican voters are so full of toxic ethno-nationalism that they want a strong leader to avenge them , no matter the consequences .\nThe question reporters should be pursuing is : How can there not be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy ?\nOr maybe there is , and they just aren \u2019 t telling us ?\nInstead of asking voters why they like or dislike DeSantis , they should be asking questions like \u201c What kind of country to you want to live in ?\n\u201d Some of the DeSantis coverage in the Washington Post and the New York Times has been replete with incriminating facts \u2013 although I would argue that even then , the wildly aberrant nature of what DeSantis is doing doesn \u2019 t come through strongly enough , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed to \u201c Democrats \u201d .\nPatricia Mazzei wrote a fabulous story for the New York Times in April , describing the paroxysm that \u2019 s seizing Florida .\nNeither the headline nor the tone was sufficiently alarming .\nI \u2019 m not saying she should have said flat-out that Florida has become a petri dish for fascism , but calling it \u201c a laboratory of possibility for the political right \u201d seems understated .\nShe did , however , provide an excellent overview of what DeSantis has been doing : In her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and euphemistic , writing that the most likely scenario going forward was \u201c a sustained campaign toward a new , more rigid conservative orthodoxy , one that voters could very well ratify this fall.\n\u201d But it \u2019 s not \u201c more rigid conservative orthodoxy.\n\u201d It \u2019 s a well-financed fascist cult of personality , as Mazzei herself described : There \u2019 s plenty of grist in there for a solid boilerplate paragraph that gives readers at least a hint of how radical and authoritarian DeSantis is .\nBut no .\nEven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recent DeSantis speech , the governor was left to define himself .\nHe was introduced as the man \u201c widely seen as the Republican who poses the biggest threat to Donald J. Trump if they both run for president in 2024.\n\u201d Then came the stenography : Although the reporters are unwilling to tell readers who DeSantis really is , they are generous with the strategic analysis .\nSo , from that same story : It \u2019 s not that the political media isn \u2019 t watching DeSantis closely .\nIn fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him \u2014 but more as fanboys than as watchdogs .\nAfter the FBI carted away stolen government documents from Trump \u2019 s residence , Blake Hounshell wrote in the New York Times : \u201c The political world watches DeSantis \u2019 s every move nowadays , and many awaited his reaction to the search with bated breath.\n\u201d Where political reporters are most comfortable is doing pure horserace analysis .\nSo in the Washington Post , Aaron Blake ranked \u201c The top 10 Republican presidential candidates for 2024 \u201d .\nDeSantis came in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also been suckers for DeSantis \u2019 s staged events .\nFor instance , when he announced that his new police force had filed criminal voter-fraud charges against a tiny smattering of ex-cons , most reporters wrote it straight .\nThe real story , however , was how few people his police force found , who they targeted , and most importantly how , as the Miami Herald editorial board explained , the event was \u201c actually about voter intimidation on the eve of an election.\n\u201d Even the coverage of DeSantis \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muted .\nA recent AP story , for instance , simply reported that DeSantis \u201c signed into law new guidelines Friday involving race-based discussions in businesses and schools as part of his campaign against critical race theory , which he called \u2018 pernicious \u2019 ideology.\n\u201d The law effectively bans open discussion in schools or private businesses of slavery , segregation , lynchings , and modern-day racism as a byproduct of racist conspiracy theories .\nIt constitutes viewpoint-based restriction on private speech , which very clearly violates the First Amendment .\nAnd reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the best analyses of DeSantis was in an April article by Zack Beauchamp for Vox , which examined all the parallels between DeSantis and Orb\u00e1n .\nThe Miami Herald editorial board wrote in early August that \u201c DeSantis is a powerful governor testing the boundaries of political norms in an attempt to turn the state into the dream of autocrats \u2014 where checks and balances are on paper only.\n\u201d They wrote that \u201c DeSantis has an unquenchable thirst for political wars and the spotlight .\nHe will stretch and test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable as much as he can.\n\u201d True libertarians are appropriately panicked .\nWriting in Reason , Jacob Sullum argued that DeSantis \u2019 s view of the First Amendment \u201c is not just diametrically wrong but dangerously shortsighted .\nDepending on the vicissitudes of elections , a government with the powers DeSantis has claimed easily could use them to advance \u201c the far-left woke agenda \u201d that keeps him awake at night.\n\u201d Reporters should also be writing about ways to proactively to limit the damage a fascist president could do .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this one from Thor Benson , in Wired , about how authoritarian leaders use mass surveillance to control their citizens .\nHe quotes Neil Richards , a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis , on the need for legislation that protects the privacy of Americans so existing surveillance mechanisms can no longer be abused .\nAnd journalists should be afraid for their own profession .\nDeSantis banned mainstream-media reporters from attending a Republican summit , only allowing in right-wing outlets that gave him good coverage .\nHis former press secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a DeSantis event in Ohio demanded that media organizations let them review their footage , among other restrictions .\nThat \u2019 s crazy .\nNews organizations should be prepared to fight back , like the editor of the Cleveland Plain Dealer did , decrying \u201c policies you \u2019 d see in a fascist regime \u201d and running a big gray box in lieu of a photo .\nThe argument I sometimes hear from establishment media types is that when reporters describe outrageous things a politician has done , that \u2019 s enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly stop using emotionless jargon and both-sides story structures .\nThere \u2019 s no need for yelling , readers can contextualize this stuff for themselves , they tell me .\nBut the fact is that reporters are contextualizing these actions , they \u2019 re just doing it with euphemisms , or at the strategic level .\nThe stakes are so high that reporters must not understate them .\nThat is not the same as screaming .\nThat is doing their job .", "author": "Dan Froomkin", "url": "https://presswatchers.org/2022/08/coverage-of-ron-desantis-shows-the-media-has-learned-nothing-from-trump/", "published":

@ class \u201d voters stupid questions ?\n\u2022 Which New York Times editors signed off on the big all-caps , top-of-the-front-page headline \u201c A Simmering Feud Peaks in Search of Trump \u2019 s Home \u201d \u2014 validating the bullshit Republican frame that searching Trump \u2019 s home for stolen documents was an act of partisan hostility rather than the much-delayed redressing of an obvious crime ?\n\u2022 Who at the New York Times thought this article about the violent rhetoric of the right didn \u2019 t need any context about the danger that poses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Post made the call that Fox News \u2019 s evening lineup consists of \u201c conservative opinion shows \u201d instead of \u201c radical right wing propaganda and misinformation \u201c ?\nLooking through my Press Watch archive and my Twitter timeline for older examples , I sure would have liked to know : \u2022 Which New York Times editor thought that the 2021 headline \u201c Energizing Conservative Voters , One School Board Election at a Time \u201d was more appropriate than the much more accurate \u201c Republicans riling up voters with a lie designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who wrote the banner Washington Post headline in September 2019 : \u201c Trump , GOP hit back as coverup is alleged \u201d when everyone else headlined the coverup ( and it wasn \u2019 t \u201c hitting back \u201d anyway , it was \u201c lashing out \u201d . )\n\u2022 Who at the New York Times wrote the snide headline and subhead that called a December 2020 Democratic attempt in to pass a Covid relief bill a failed \u201c bit of political theater \u201d when its own story said nothing of the sort ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOP blocks $ 2,000 checks as Trump leaves COVID aid in chaos.\n\u201d I thought the Times reporters were owed an apology . )\n\u2022 Who at the New York Times assigned the 2020 interview with the pro-Trump Nebraska farmer whose tractor burned down ?\n\u2022 Who sent New York Times reporter Elaina Plott to Atlanta in 2020 in search of \u201c real \u201d white college-educated Trump supporters , and didn \u2019 t stop to ask how she found them and whether they weren \u2019 t actually Republican operatives ?\n\u2022 Which New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure that the guy Jeremy Peters chose to exemplify his thesis about ordinary Virginians voting Republican in 2021 due to their \u201c dissatisfaction with the political culture \u201d wasn \u2019 t actually a prolific Republican donor and spreader of false scare stories about \u201c critical race theory \u201d ?\n\u2022 Which spineless editor at the New York Times changed the word \u201c failures \u201d to \u201c missteps \u201d in a 2020 story about the White House \u2019 s handling of the Covid epidemic ?\nAnd who \u2019 s the hero who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Times editor decided it was appropriate to give Mitch McConnell and Republicans credit for ending the fake political and financial crisis they ginned up in 2021 purely to confound Democrats ?\n\u2022 How many New York Times editors signed off this 2021 analysis of \u201c endemic misinformation \u201d in partisan politics that never addressed who is spreading it ?\nI often feel that there are warring camps of editors at our major news organizations \u2013 and we deserve to know who \u2019 s where .\nIt was an editor on the Associate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this April 17 , 2020 story reporting that Trump \u201c has given governors a road map for recovering from the economic pain of the coronavirus pandemic .\nIt was an editor of Team Gutsy who moved this story , only hours later , saying that those guidelines \u201c had the hallmarks of a permission structure .\nBut what he really created was a blame structure.\n\u201d Someone on Team Spineless edited this October 9 , 2020 story quoting Trump saying he felt \u201c perfect \u201d a week after his Covid diagnosis .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hours later , reporting that Trump had \u201c demonstrated anew \u201d that \u201c he can \u2019 t be relied on to give a straight account of the disease that has afflicted millions , now including him.\n\u201d It \u2019 s inexplicable to an outsider without a roster .\nThe Washington Post , similarly , runs bold articles full of straight-shooting democracy coverage , like \u201c Trump-allied lawyers pursued voting machine data in multiple states , records reveal \u201d but also obsequious and obfuscating articles like \u201c Michigan plot to breach voting machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which tried to airbrush Republicans out of the picture .\nThese don \u2019 t simply represent the work of different reporters ; they represent utterly different editorial philosophies .\nSometimes , it \u2019 s the editors at the Post and the Times who go head to head .\nIn 2019 , both papers published stories on the biggest takeaways from the transcript of Trump \u2019 s extortionate phone call with Volodomyr Zelensky .\nThe Post \u2019 s version : \u201c 1 .\nIt mentions no explicit quid pro quo.\n\u201d The Times \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an investigation into the Bidens.\n\u201d The Times won !\nBut to whom should I have presented the award ?\nWho can I

class", "content": "Washington Post media reporter Sarah Ellison profiled the new owner of Politico this week , raising a number of disturbing questions .\nThe new owner is Mathias D\u00f6pfner , the right-wing billionaire CEO of international publishing giant Axel Springer .\nHis company bought Politico for a billion dollars last year .\nThe biggest revelation in the Post story was that shortly before the 2020 U.S. election , D\u00f6pfner proposed to his closest executives that they \u201c get together for an hour in the morning on November 3 and pray that Donald Trump will again become President of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No American administration in the last 50 years has done more.\n\u201d When Ellison asked him about the email , he lied and said it didn \u2019 t exist .\nThen he said he was just being provocative .\nThe big question , then , is : What is this lying , right-wing billionaire telling Politico to do ?\nD\u00f6pfner \u2019 s explanation to Ellison was transparently insincere : \u201c We want to prove that being nonpartisan is actually the more successful positioning , \u201d he told Ellison , calling it his \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported those words like they meant something .\nThe story was actually headlined \u201c Politico \u2019 s new German owner has a \u2018 contrarian \u2019 plan for American media.\n\u201d But they mean nothing !\nPretty much every major news organization in America positions itself as nonpartisan .\n( Fox is not a news organization . )\nAnd what does D\u00f6pfner mean by \u201c contrarian \u201d ?\nAs I asked in a tweet : \u201c When the media spectrum spans from truth-denying to truth-embracing , what the heck does \u2018 contrarian \u2019 even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public marching orders are such an obvious fiction , you have to wonder what the private marching orders are .\nAnd when I came across one particular Politico article on Thursday , well , I wondered .\nSomeone had emailed me an excerpt , and I took it for an opinion piece by a Republican operative , it was so warped .\nBut no .\nAs I tweeted : \u201c I \u2019 m not saying that Mathias D\u00f6pfner is directly ordering Politico to print the most brainless , feverish , simpering right-wing twaddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.\n\u201d Here \u2019 s how Politico reporters Jordain Carney and Sarah Ferris started off : If House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and his party wrest back control of the House this fall , they \u2019 d take power with one of the worst relationships with a sitting president in recent memory .\nPresident Joe Biden and his party have spent much of this year vilifying McCarthy and his GOP counterparts as a threat that would unravel democracy \u2014 an attack that is now at the centerpiece of Democratic efforts to hold onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those Republicans , meanwhile , have echoed and amplified unfounded doubts about Biden \u2019 s election , all while pledging to use their newfound power to investigate the president \u2019 s son and , potentially , impeach members of his Cabinet .\nThe worsening polarization in Washington that , at times , became openly hostile during Donald Trump \u2019 s administration , could become downright combustible in January .\nAnd , making matters worse , each side is arguing that the other must make the first peace offering .\nLet me rewrite that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m not saying that D\u00f6pfner ordered up that godforsaken story ( though I \u2019 d sure like to know who assigned it . )\nBut it could only have been created in a newsroom where the business model is not compatible with accountability journalism .\nMy best guess is that D\u00f6pfner \u2019 s \u201c nonpartisan \u201d business model calls for reaping vast amounts of money from lobbyists who pay a premium to reach leaders of both parties .\nAnd that effectively requires reporters to do whatever it takes for McCarthy and the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough that they return their calls and read their work .\nPolitico , of course , isn \u2019 t the only major media organization owned by a billionaire .\nAs former-Obama-adviser-turned-podcaster Dan Pfeiffer wrote in his newsletter , \u201c ABC is part of the Disney Corporation .\nNBC is owned by Comcast .\nJeff Bezos bought the Washington Post with the equivalent of the change you \u2019 d find in your couch.\n\u201d Pfeiffer was actually writing about CNN , which has been the subject of a lot of breathless coverage in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause for concern .\nAs I wrote last month , the firing of Brian Stelter indicated that CNN \u2019 s new CEO Chris Licht was capitulating to John Malone , the Fox-loving cable oligarch who owns much of the company that now owns CNN .\nStelter had been one of the network \u2019 s most outspoken critics of Fox , and spoke with great insight about Trump \u2019 s demagoguery .\nSo , too , did veteran White House reporter John Harwood , whose last day at CNN was Monday .\nThe video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , truth-telling report about how Biden was right to warn of GOP threats to democracy got 3.5 million views .\nThen , this week CNN announced it is hiring John Miller , a truly despicable person , to be its \u201c Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst.\n\u201d Parker Molloy and Spencer Ackerman have the absolutely infuriating facts .\nHe \u2019 s a liar and an enabler .\nFor instance , while at the NYPD , he denied that the department spied on Muslims after 9/11 .\nThe AP won the 2012 Pulitzer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spying operations .\nCNN , unlike D\u00f6pfner , is sending the clearest possible signals to the public that it is OK with fascism .\nBut what is Licht privately telling CNN hosts and editors to do ?\nThere \u2019 s a lot of speculation and gossip .\nCNN anchor Brianna Keilar \u2019 s complaint about Marine guards positioned behind Biden during his speech struck many as a clear sign of new right-wing marching orders .\nBut there \u2019 s a little bit of good news on that front .\nOn Thursday , Keilar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drew Griffin that exposed a cheating \u201c MAGA army \u201d being trained to \u201c break the rules \u201d as poll workers .\nThere were no words minced there .\nNew York Times reporter Astead Herndon launched a new podcast devoted exclusively to the midterm elections this week , and his first episode was titled \u201c The Stakes \u201d .\nYes !\nThat \u2019 s what it \u2019 s all about : The stakes .\nNews organizations shouldn \u2019 t tell people what party to vote for .\nBut they should make sure they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited to hear Herndon talk about voter frustration and then conclude : \u201c All these things that are making people feel so disconnected , they actually make the midterms more important than ever .\nBecause if Republicans take back the House , political divisions in Washington will only escalate.\n\u201d But then I went and heard Herndon being interviewed by Michael Barbaro , the breathy both-sidesing host of The Daily , and all they talked about \u2013 at least all Barbaro wanted to hear about \u2013 was who \u2019 s up and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overturning abortion rights and embracing insurrectionists as ways Republicans \u201c hurt themselves \u201d politically .\nDemocrats , by contrast , are \u201c looking to exploit what they see as these self-inflicted messaging wounds that Republicans have made.\n\u201d Barbaro \u2019 s conclusion : \u201c So regardless of your politics , the government you \u2019 re describing is going to feel not just dysfunctional , but vindictive and nasty.\n\u201d Ugh .\nMeanwhile , the Washington Post \u2019 s Democracy Team is in full swing , which is great , but it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote a moving story about how no one wants to run the elections in Fulton County , Georgia , because of \u201c the toxic swirl of state politics , national scrutiny , ongoing harassment and long-standing logistical issues.\n\u201d The fact that the toxicity , scrutiny and harassment are coming exclusively from one party ?\nThat \u2019 s almost covered up .\nMost Undercovered Stories of the Week \u2022 A Reuters poll finding that a huge majority \u2014 58 % \u2014 of Americans believe

\u201c cautionary tale \u201d is one hell of a euphemism .\nAnd the article left readers scratching their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why \u201d \u2013 which of course is to suppress and reject Democratic votes , especially from Blacks and Hispanics .\nWhy the \u201c hyper-focus on the state \u2019 s most populous county \u201d ?\nWhy \u2014 if Arizona \u2019 s effort \u201c turned up few cases \u201d \u2014 and \u201c just fueled more bogus theories and distrust \u201d \u2014 do Republicans still consider it a model ?\nNone of these \u201c facts \u201d make sense if you essentially hide the rationale .\nSimilarly , a major New York Times article by Steve Eder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the 139 Republicans in the House who voted to dispute the Electoral College count ostensibly explained \u201c how they got there.\n\u201d But the story was so plagued by cowardly euphemisms \u2014 like \u201c calculated double-talk \u201d and \u201c demographic change \u201d instead of \u201c outrageous lies \u201d and \u201c fueled by white grievance \u201d \u2014that it was almost unintelligible .\nAnd beyond an anecdote or two , they breeze over the extraordinary cravenness and hypocrisy these House members exhibited \u2013 first succumbing to Trump , then expressing horror , then snapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and editors maintain that they are above the fray , and that there is nobility in refusing to take sides .\nBut to generate the kind of both-sides coverage they do , they adopt Republican talking points and accept countless Republican lies as truth .\nThey consider it a given that Republicans are \u201c stronger \u201d on inflation , crime , and immigration than Democrats , despite the party \u2019 s abject failure to make actual policy proposals .\nThey unquestioningly adopt the view that undocumented immigrants are a bad thing , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that anti-racism is racism against white people .\nNone of that is true .\nAt one time or another , most of our major news organizations have accurately explained what is really happening : That the GOP has become violent , deceitful , fueled by white grievance , and that should it gain power it may never give it back .\nAt the very least , there should be a boilerplate paragraph to that effect in every story that is even remotely about the upcoming elections .\nBut if they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be wholly about that , from now until Election Day .", "author": "Dan Froomkin", "url": "https://presswatchers.org/2022/10/the-facts-need-a-little-help/", "published": "Wed, 05 Oct 2022 13:24:46 +0000",

Washington Post has a Bezos problem", "content": "For a news organization , being owned by an oligarch can be complicated .\nIn 2013 , when Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post from the Graham family , those complications were not top of mind .\nThe Post was in a downward spiral , sloughing off staff and flirting with irrelevance .\nBezos \u2019 s money changed everything , bulking up the newsroom , revolutionizing its technology , and firmly reestablishing it as a dominant voice in the national media .\nBut the conflicts of interest are self-evident .\nPretty much every public-policy issue the Post covers affects Bezos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in material ways .\nThe very existence of people as rich as Bezos clashes with the notion of economic fairness .\nRecent moves have called renewed attention to how Bezos \u2019 s ownership constitutes a massive and almost entirely unaddressed conflict of interest for the Post .\nIn May , Bezos started posting highly provocative anti-Biden tweets , mocking the president \u2019 s moves to expose corporate greed and increase taxes on the wealthy .\nIn July , he accused Biden of \u201c straight ahead misdirection or a deep misunderstanding of basic market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about its political goals : its $ 20 million annual lobbying budget , which makes it the second-highest corporate spender in Washington , has been ruthlessly effective at fending off privacy protections , antitrust issues , internet regulation , tougher labor laws , and greater worker protection .\nAmazon has become \u201c almost a poster child for tech-fueled bigness run amok , \u201d said Edward Wasserman , a media ethicist , professor , and former dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at Berkeley .\nAnd Bezos appears to have shaken off whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in politics , \u201c picking gratuitous policy-related fights with the White House.\n\u201d \u201c These billionaires , they like to be heard , \u201d Wasserman said .\nNow , nearly a decade after he bought the Post , Bezos has a leadership team at the company that is entirely his own .\nBezos hired a new publisher early on , in 2014 , picking Fred Ryan , a former Reagan administration official , chairman of the board of trustees for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation , and a cofounder of Politico .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s newsroom and opinion pages continued to be run by traditionalists held over from the Graham era : Marty Baron , the executive editor , and Fred Hiatt , who had already been editorial page editor for thirteen years when Bezos took over .\nBaron retired last year , allowing Bezos and Ryan to hire their own new executive editor .\nThey chose Sally Buzbee , the top editor at the Associated Press .\nThose who saw her as a potential champion of journalistic values have been disappointed ; she has kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And in early September\u2014nine months after Hiatt unexpectedly died\u2014the Post installed a new editorial page editor , David Shipley , a journalist closely tied to another oligarch , Mike Bloomberg .\nThroughout history , newspapers have frequently been owned by moguls\u2014and readers were at times appropriately apprehensive .\nIn this era , Rupert Murdoch has created a powerful media empire , which includes Fox News and the Wall Street Journal , and his influence has been considerable .\nBut Bezos is in a different league even from Murdoch .\nThe world has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has never been so interconnected .\nBeing owned by someone with such vast economic interests \u201c is not compatible with the kind of independence we normally associate with independent news organizations , \u201d said Wasserman .\nNobody at the Post\u2014not Ryan , not Buzbee , not Shipley , not even a spokesperson\u2014would answer specific questions about Bezos \u2019 s influence on the record .\nThe paper did supply a general statement .\n\u201c The Washington Post operates independently and discloses its ownership within articles when applicable .\nOur aggressive coverage of labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokeswoman Molly Gannon wrote in an email .\nThe two biggest reasons not to be concerned about Bezos owning the Post are that the Post has a powerful and long history of independence ; and that , according to multiple sources , Bezos has never demonstrated an inclination to interfere with the Post \u2019 s journalism .\n\u201c Just because there is a potential for a situation where Bezos influences the newsroom , that doesn \u2019 t mean it \u2019 s going to happen , \u201d one editor told me .\nSeveral reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that Bezos has ever weighed in on anything other than strategic matters focused on the business side .\nBut one acknowledged the possible impact of self-censorship .\n\u201c What I feel most is a little bit of reluctance to take him on , \u201d the reporter said .\n\u201c It certainly can complicate things.\n\u201d As soon as Bezos started a Twitter war with President Biden , long-neglected concerns about his influence on the newsroom became considerably less abstract .\nIt all started with this tweet , on May 13 : As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Biden \u2019 s tweet \u201c didn \u2019 t name Amazon or Bezos , but Bezos felt compelled to respond all the same.\n\u201d ( The reference to the \u201c disinformation board \u201d was based on a right-wing conspiracy theory . )\nTwo days later , Bezos tweeted that \u201c the administration tried hard to inject even more stimulus into an already over-heated , inflationary economy and only [ West Virginia senator Joe ] Manchin saved them from themselves.\n\u201d As the Post itself reported ( to its credit ) , \u201c The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bezos \u2019 attacks emerged days after Biden met in the Oval Office with the labor leaders behind Amazon \u2019 s unionization drive , which the company has vehemently opposed.\n\u201d The White House also pointed out that Bezos would pay an additional $ 35 billion under the administration \u2019 s billionaire tax plan .\nBezos shot back with another tweet , mocking the White House response .\nThe next day , after Post opinion writer Catherine Rampell\u2014somewhat out of character\u2014ridiculed progressives who argue that the greed of monopolies and large corporations amounts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd in early July , Bezos responded contemptuously to Biden \u2019 s plea to gasoline producers to stop exploiting inflated market prices .\nBiden had implored them : \u201c Bring down the price you are charging at the pump to reflect the cost you \u2019 re paying for the product.\n\u201d \u201c Ouch , \u201d Bezos wrote .\n\u201c Inflation is far too important a problem for the White House to keep making statements like this .\nIt \u2019 s either straight ahead misdirection or a deep misunderstanding of basic market dynamics.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Andrew Perez and David Sirota wrote on the leftist Jacobin website : \u201c If you were looking for a digital era version of Citizen Kane behavior , this is it.\n\u201d Jack Shafer , Politico \u2019 s media writer , acknowledged that \u201c Bezos \u2019 outbursts could also unfairly complicate life for his own journalists ; if the paper produces critical coverage of the president\u2014often more than justified !\n\u2014Post skeptics will wonder if it was marching orders from the boss.\n\u201d Most notably\u2014given Bezos \u2019 s views about Biden and inflation\u2014Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy has consistently been more negative than its competitors \u2019 .\nThe Post doesn \u2019 t hesitate to identify inflation as a Biden problem , often while ignoring that it \u2019 s a global problem .\nIts political reporters have frequently declared inflation to be the central issue of the midterm elections ( which it is not ) .\nThe New York Times has similar issues , but comparing their coverage of positive job reports , for example , one finds the Post almost always casting the news in a worse light for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some journalism watchers , the most backhanded defense of the Post is that it has not buckled to Bezos\u2014it \u2019 s always been this way .\n\u201c Bezos didn \u2019 t need to make any changes ; the Post had already adopted the establishment , pro-corporate view , \u201d said Robert W. McChesney , the author of several books on media and politics .\n\u201c Its editorial line was pretty compatible with his on the issues that mattered to him.\n\u201d Jeff Cohen , an emeritus journalism professor and cofounder of fair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it this way : \u201c The main thing that the liberal media doesn \u2019 t cover well is victims without victimizers .\nThey \u2019 ll talk about poverty , and systemic racism , but they \u2019 ll never talk about who \u2019 s benefiting from it .\nWho \u2019 s behind it ?\nThey don \u2019 t name the names of who \u2019 s benefiting .\nAnd on some social and economic issues , Bezos is one of the main beneficiaries.\n\u201d Nobody is suggesting that Bezos is specifically or directly telling Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to write it .\nIndeed , Bezos is widely seen as uninterested in what the newsroom produces , as long as it gets attention and advances his plans for the Post to become a global brand .\n( He was , for instance , the driving force behind the Post setting up two new \u201c global hubs \u201d in London and Seoul that take over operations when Washington winds down . )\nBut he doesn \u2019 t have to say anything to make things happen .\n\u201c That \u2019 s not how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victor Pickard , a professor at the University of Pennsylvania \u2019 s Annenberg School for Communication .\nRather , \u201c there are more subtle kinds of ideological policing , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Journalists internalize broader power relationships that can help steer media coverage in particular ways.\n\u201d \u201c At a minimum , the positions he \u2019 s taking are going to change the way staff at the Washington Post are perceived , \u201d Wasserman said .\n\u201c Right now I \u2019 m just saying \u2018 perceived.\n\u2019 But it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his preferences are going to have an important influence over the way the newsroom operates.\n\u201d That \u2019 s why the tweets are so troubling .\nThey make it clear what Bezos wants to hear .\nJournalists are not immune to such pressures .\nIn fact , quite the opposite .\n\u201c They \u2019 re very sensitive people .\nThey spend a lot of time sniffing the wind , \u201d Wasserman said .\n\u201c The values of the owner tend to be communicated subtly , \u201d said McChesney , the author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those who don \u2019 t pick up the signals \u201c get weeded out along the way.\n\u201d The Post needs to explain to its readers how it intends to address the conflict inherent in the fact that it \u2019 s owned by the world \u2019 s richest man .\nThe idea , Pickard said , is \u201c to force this to become conscious , to make what \u2019 s implicit more explicit , to make it more public.\n\u201c Bezos issued a pledge upon buying the Post nearly ten years ago , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not need changing .\nThe paper \u2019 s duty will remain to its readers and not to the private interests of its owners .\nWe will continue to follow the truth wherever it leads , and we \u2019 ll work hard not to make mistakes .\nWhen we do , we will own up to them quickly and completely.\n\u201d But there \u2019 s nothing related to Bezos \u2019 s ownership in the Post \u2019 s updated , official \u201c Policies and Standards \u201d document , which includes an ethics policy .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ who researches the effects of media ownership , explained : \u201c There \u2019 s a long section about conflicts of interest\u2014but it \u2019 s all about journalists \u2019 s conflicts of interest , relatively little things , in terms of taking gifts or whatever .\nIt says nothing about how the Post should cover its owner or its owner \u2019 s conflicts of interest .\n\u201c There \u2019 s nothing on the website that says \u2018 Here \u2019 s how we should deal with the fact that we \u2019 re owned by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u2019 \u201d Benson said .\n\u201c I think they need to add some more provisions on the relationship with the owner.\n\u201d Benson noted that French publications , like Le Monde , publish codes of conduct that specify how their editorial freedom is protected from interference by the owners .\nSo , for instance , the shareholders \u201c signed a charter of ethics guaranteeing the newspaper \u2019 s complete editorial freedom \u201d and agreed to \u201c not take part in editorial choices \u201d and to \u201c refrain from commissioning an article and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or prevent its publication.\n\u201d The paper also includes a statement of principles : The Post could follow suit and publish a statement of its core journalistic values\u2014emphasizing those that embody its independence from an oligarch owner .\nKelly McBride , senior vice president of the Poynter Institute and public editor for NPR , suggested that Post editors announce an \u201c extra layer of editing \u201d for stories related to Bezos \u2019 s business interests .\nAnd she said the editors should find ways to hold themselves accountable to the reading public .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great forum for a public editor.\n\u201d ( The Post eliminated its ombudsman position a few months before the Bezos purchase . )\nSome critics , myself included , would like to see Buzbee publicly announce that she is committing additional resources to cover issues where Bezos \u2019 s interests are implicated , like workers \u2019 rights , the damage caused by monopolies , and income inequality .\n\u201c Increasing coverage in areas that you know would be vexing to your owners and putting extra editorial resources to those areas may well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsroom is being corrupted , \u201d Wasserman said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a way to manage the problem in a way that very much advances and doubles down on a traditional view of news ethics .\nIt does assert in a very compelling way that we \u2019 re aware that our ownership could be a problem , and this is what we \u2019 re doing about it.\n\u201d What else could the Post do ?\nDan Kennedy , a journalism professor at Northeastern University , credited Bezos for having \u201c a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news section.\n\u201d But he said if the Post editors really wanted to resolve the conflict-of-interest question , \u201c I suppose nothing would answer the question more thoroughly than if they suddenly unveiled a real ass-kicking story about Amazon\u2014a real in-depth piece of enterprise reporting that reflected pretty harshly on their owner .\nThat would answer the question pretty thoroughly , wouldn \u2019 t it ?\n\u201d Cohen has a specific suggestion .\nHe is still fuming about a ridiculous 2017 Post \u201c fact check \u201d of a statement , by Bernie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world\u2014which of course would include Bezos\u2014have \u201c as much wealth as the bottom half of the world \u2019 s population.\n\u201d The Post gave it \u201c three Pinocchios \u201d because although it was \u201c technically correct , \u201d it \u201c lacked nuance.\n\u201d \u201c If they fact-checked Bernie on the six wealthiest people , then they could do a fact-check on their owner regarding taxation and Biden .\nThat would be the right thing to do , \u201d Cohen said .\nBob Kaiser , a former managing editor of the Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c easily addressed , probably with some evergreen statement that Bezos and the editors could agree on.\n\u201d And he said he doesn \u2019 t think the Post should alter its course to prove anything .\n\u201c I think the Post should cover the news aggressively , always .\nI don \u2019 t want to have some special mission based on who \u2019 s the owner , either way.\n\u201d One thing that sure couldn \u2019 t hurt , of course , would be for Bezos to hold his tongue .\n\u201c The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very careful , \u201d McBride said , \u201c and when they \u2019 re preparing to say something that will obviously cause people to question the independence of their media organization , they will include a caveat that says : \u2018 I have hired really good editors , and they run the paper with a loyalty to the audience .\nThey do not serve my interests.\n\u2019 \u201d And then there \u2019 s a long-term solution that would erase any doubts about independence : \u201c Ideally , \u201d McChesney told me , \u201c what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a formal statement setting the funds aside.\n\u201d His advice to Bezos : \u201c Set it up to be truly independent .\nMake it a nonprofit .\nYou get a huge tax write-off.\n\u201d Then , \u201c get out of the way and go do it in other cities.\n\u201d Putting the entire operation on a nonprofit footing would also guarantee the Post \u2019 s independence for eternity , regardless of what Bezos \u2019 s heirs might have in mind .\nAs long as Bezos is the owner , \u201c you \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t have the capacity to solve\u2014you can only manage it , \u201d Wasserman said .\n\u201c And whatever you do\u2014even if you go out of your way to do stories sympathetic to the labor movement within Amazon\u2014you \u2019 re going to be seen as asserting an independence that nobody thinks you have.\n\u201d \u201c This is not just the Post \u2019 s problem or Jeff Bezos \u2019 s problem , \u201d Pickard said .\n\u201c This is our problem as a democratic society .\n\u201d", "author": "Dan Froomkin", "url":

he bought the Washington Post , Jeff Bezos finally has a management team in place that is entirely his own .\nBezos \u2019 s early infusion of money positioned the Post as a serious contender in the ongoing national and international news competition .\nBut can his leadership team keep that momentum going ?\nWith readership and revenue both declining\u2014and Bezos evidently unwilling to make up the difference\u2014the Post is considering reducing the newsroom by a hundred positions , or about 10 percent , according to the New York Times .\nHere is the Bezos lineup .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought the Post , Bezos hired Washington insider Fred Ryan as publisher and chief executive .\nIn the Times article , Benjamin Mullin and Katie Robertson described Ryan as indecisive and a micromanager .\nThey wrote that he monitors badge swipes to see who is coming into the office , and expressed concerns that lower videoconferencing activity on Fridays was a sign of reporters slacking off .\n( Positively correlating meetings with productivity became the subject of widespread derision on journalistic Twitter . )\nRyan also just lost Shailesh Prakash , the Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person most responsible for the extraordinary success of its publishing system .\nBezos thought so highly of Prakash he appointed him to the board of Blue Origin , his space travel venture .\nPrakash is off to Google .\n( Update : Kat Downs Mulder , the Post \u2019 s widely admired managing editor for digital and \u201c chief product officer \u201d left in early October . )\nRyan was previously publisher and chief executive at Politico , which he helped found in 2007 .\nBut he is first and foremost an acolyte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began political work in 1980 , serving on Reagan \u2019 s first presidential campaign , in his White House , and as his chief of staff .\nIn 1995 , Ryan became the chairman of the board of trustees of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation , a position he has now held for twenty-seven years .\nIn April , Ryan welcomed Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett to an event at the Reagan Library , called her \u201c extraordinary , \u201d tossed her softball questions , and asked about the \u201c growing concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s universities.\n\u201d He helped unveil the Nancy Reagan stamp at the beginning of Pride Month .\nRyan has made a handful of strong statements demanding accountability from the Saudi government for the murder and dismemberment of Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi , and is the author of Wine and the White House : A History , a 456-page book published by the White House Historical Society .\nBuzbee , whom Bezos and Ryan hired as executive editor last year after Marty Baron retired , had a solid reputation at the Associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive editor .\nBut she has certainly not been the change agent some hoped for at the Post .\nBaron had come from the Boston Globe , where his shepherding of articles exposing systemic sexual abuse within the Catholic Church earned the paper a Pulitzer and turned him into a star played by Liev Schreiber in the Best Picture\u2013winning 2016 movie Spotlight .\nBaron was also obstinate to a fault .\nBy contrast , as Andrew Beaujon reported for Washingtonian , there \u2019 s a \u201c widespread theory \u201d among Post veterans that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied for the job\u2014so that \u201c he \u2019 d finally have an executive editor who owed him.\n\u201d Taking over from Baron , Buzbee had the chance to turn the Post into the accountability-journalism , truth-to-power engine its readers crave , and to make the newsroom more inclusive and democratic .\nBut profiling her for Vanity Fair , Charlotte Klein found Buzbee has yet to find her stride .\nWhile Buzbee \u2019 s decision to stand up a \u201c Democracy Team \u201d at the Post was seen as a bold move , Klein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked whether threats to democracy are coming more from Republicans than Democrats .\n\u201c I mean , if it \u2019 s Republicans who are doing it , if it \u2019 s Democrats who are doing it , it \u2019 s our job to call that out , \u201d Buzbee said .\nThe culture of the Post under Baron strongly discouraged self-examination .\nBuzbee appears to be continuing that tradition .\nShe chose to fire pugnacious newsroom whistleblower Felicia Sonmez in June , rather than welcome her challenge to redress newsroom inequities .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c contentious meeting \u201d that same month , \u201c some staff members told Buzbee that she had not yet earned their trust , according to several people among dozens in attendance.\n\u201d In her defense , as a Post reporter told me , \u201c It \u2019 s been a very tough time for anyone to get their footing.\n\u201d In July , Bezos hired David Shipley , the former editor of Bloomberg News \u2019 s editorial pages , as the editorial page editor for the Post .\nShipley , along with his deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their jobs at Bloomberg Opinion to work on Mike Bloomberg \u2019 s disastrous presidential campaign .\nIn a memo to Bloomberg News staff upon the announcement of Bloomberg \u2019 s presidential run , editor in chief John Micklethwait made it clear what Shipley \u2019 s marching orders had been , writing : \u201c The place where Mike has had the most contact with Editorial is Bloomberg Opinion ; our editorials have reflected his views \u201d ( emphasis added ) .\nRyan told Washington Post reporters that Shipley \u2019 s personal views and ideology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c The Post has been noted for its longtime independence in its [ editorial ] voice , and we will remain an independent voice , \u201d he insisted .\n\u201c I wasn \u2019 t looking at it in terms of wokeness or lack of wokeness , \u201d Ryan told Puck \u2019 s Tara Palmieri , using what has become a pejorative taken up by enemies of inclusiveness .\nJudging Shipley \u2019 s impact will be hard because under his predecessor , Fred Hiatt ,

available in these hearings as much as we can , and then provide in online resources for others , a wealth of other material for you and other members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrutinize .\nWell , you know , in terms of the process , as you might imagine , there ` s a volume of evidence , a mountain of evidence to try to communicate through each of these hearings which , you know , are only lasting between two and three hours .\nAnd so , we have to kind of ruthlessly say what ` s most important to convey to the public and that means a lot , hits the cutting room floor .\nNow , ultimately , we intend to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public know the much bigger volume of what we have obtained .\nI can ` t tell you exactly when that ` s going to happen but we do intend to share a lot that we couldn ` t cover in these hearings .\nBut yes , some very difficult decisions are made with each of these hearings .\nWhat is most important knowing that we can ` t convey at all or even more than a small fraction .\nI have repeatedly asked committee staff about their timetable for releasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe committee is obviously not totally averse to releasing material outside of the hearings .\nSelect dribs and drabs have been leaked to favored reporters now and again over the last few months .\nBut every day counts .\nWe can \u2019 t wait until the committee releases its final report \u2013 most likely in December .\nWhat we need right now is for journalists to start combing through it all .\nAnd not just traditional journalists either .\nSearching through the amount of evidence involved here to find the most valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen journalists \u2013 much like the ones Talking Points Memo gathered to sift through documents related to the George W. Bush-era U.S. Attorney scandal of 2007 , or that the Guardian organized to dig through thousands of expense receipts from members of Parliament in 2009 .\nWhatever news outfit offers citizens the first and/or best way for citizens to organize , annotate , highlight , and submit key facts from the supporting material will earn a lot of attention , and for good reason .\nI have to wonder why the committee would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the election .\nAs John Nichols wrote for the Nation , the GOP-fueled insurrection should absolutely be a campaign issue , framed exactly the way Liz Cheney has framed it : \u201c We all have to understand that we can not give people power who have told us that they will not honor elections .\n\u201d", "author": "Dan Froomkin", "url":

\u201cfact checking\u201d with credibility meters", "content": "All politicians lie , but not all politicians lie so much you can \u2019 t believe a word they say .\nThat latter category , however , has swelled enormously in the Trump era .\nAnd a hell of a lot of them are running for office in November .\nNews organizations are understandably loath to appear partisan .\nAnd they are evidently unwilling to assert , as they should , that Republican victories in November will bring chaos in the short run and the erosion if not end of American democracy in the longer run .\nBut that doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liars and abet their spread of disinformation .\nThey owe it to their audience to distinguish between truth and lies .\nIt used to be that the news industry \u2019 s answer to lying politicians was \u201c fact checks.\n\u201d The idea was that a news organization would apply evidence-based standards to various assertions , judge them correct or incorrect , and an incorrect verdict would serve as incentive for the politicians to correct themselves and a warning to voters .\nAs I wrote here , there are at least five different ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem is that \u201c fact-checkers \u201d go to extreme lengths to apportion their negative verdicts to both sides , thereby undermining the obvious conclusion that one party lies a hell of a lot more than the other .\nMeanwhile , political reporters keep quoting \u201c both sides \u201d and sort of vaguely hoping that their readers will understand who the liars are .\nBad assumption .\nSo , unless you are a news organization leader who thinks you are doing a fabulous job of creating an informed electorate and should just keep doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that political journalists need to come up with something different .\nMy suggestion is that every news organization in America identify defining assertions from each candidate they cover , assess their accuracy , then let the readers know , overall , who \u2019 s credible and who isn \u2019 t \u2013 ideally with an actual credibility meter .\nWho can be trusted to tell you , the voters , the truth ?\nAnd who can \u2019 t ?\nSome of this will require a lot of work .\nBut journalists everywhere have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Washington Post and FiveThirtyEight of all the election deniers running for office .\n( The New York Times has a database , too , but as of this writing apparently isn \u2019 t confident enough in it to share . )\nThe accompanying articles , while unstinting in their analysis , nevertheless fell short because they neglected to explain why denying the election is so important .\nIt \u2019 s important because these people are liars .\nThey can \u2019 t be trusted .\nThey can \u2019 t be trusted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t be trusted in what they do .\nIn particular , they can \u2019 t be trusted to leave office if they lose .\nGet that ?\nThey can \u2019 t be trusted not to seize power against the will of the voters .\nThat \u2019 s major .\nThat \u2019 s not a side issue .\nThat should be in the lead of every news article about them , spelled out .\nAnd while that \u2019 s a great litmus test for credibility , it \u2019 s not the only one .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rhetoric of \u201c replacement theory.\n\u201d If they do , they \u2019 re both liars and racists .\nThat one \u2019 s not hard , either .\nMNBC blogger Steve Benen wrote an excellent post last week about how \u201c leading Republicans have narrowed their focus to a handful of oft-repeated lines of attack \u201d that are demonstrably false .\nThere \u2019 s the lie about the \u201c army of 87,000 IRS agents that Democrats enlisted to spy on your bank accounts.\n\u201d Deceptive and inflammatory .\nThere \u2019 s the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who attend school board meetings as \u2018 domestic terrorists.\n\u2019 \u201d Deceptive an inflammatory .\nI would add that claiming that the border is \u201c open \u201d is incredibly deceptive and inflammatory , as are so many other mythologies of the right , ranging from the destruction of major cities by Black Lives Matter to the use of kitty litter in classrooms for students who identify as \u201c furry \u201d .\nThe problem with almost all the political reporting of the last six years is that it doesn \u2019 t hold liars accountable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a \u201c fact check \u201d here and there .\nBut day in and day out , our top news organizations continue to treat these liars as if they are operating in good faith , instead of insisting on consequences for their lies .\nWhat matters most is not whether one specific comment or number is strictly accurate ( see , e.g .\n\u201c fact checks \u201d ) , but whether the campaign , as a rule , is being deceptive .\nSo what I want to see on the home page of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political races in November is a \u201c credibility meter \u201d for each candidate .\nThat \u2019 s consequences .\nAnd to encourage candidates to tell the truth , news organizations could offer to update the meter regularly .\nOf course it \u2019 s normal for politicians to engage in some hyperbole , play fast and loose with statistics , make errors in their favor , and make promises they can \u2019 t keep .\nBut the question should be : Are their standard talking points fundamentally honest or deceptive ?\nAre their depictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or complete fiction ?\nAre their campaigns fundamentally based in reality ?\nAnd when the inevitable accusations of partisan bias stream in , newsroom leaders have a perfect response , as NYU journalism professor Jay Rosen so eloquently tweeted : The only variation would be to say that we hold everyone to the same standard : the truth .", "author": "Dan Froomkin", "url":

\u2019 m being attacked from both sides , that means I \u2019 m doing it right.\n\u201d It \u2019 s a pathetic excuse for not addressing the substance of any complaint .\nAnd , as many media critics have pointed out over the years , it \u2019 s at least as likely that they \u2019 re being attacked from both sides because they \u2019 re doing it wrong .\nThat said , being attacked from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost universally loathed is quite another .\nIf pretty much everybody thinks you \u2019 re doing it wrong , it \u2019 s hard to argue that you \u2019 re doing it right .\nIf nearly everybody thinks that not only are you doing it wrong \u2013 but you \u2019 re actually a threat to democracy \u2013 then I would argue you \u2019 re doing it tragically wrong .\nA recent New York Times poll has been the talk of Washington this week because it suggested that most Americans care more about gas prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vote Republican .\n( Yes , I realize that makes no sense .\nI blame the media . )\nBut the pollsters also asked respondents whether they thought American democracy was under threat \u2013 and if so , which national institutions they felt posed a major threat , a minor threat , or no threat at all .\nOf the 71 percent of likely voters who said yes , democracy is under threat , fully 59 percent said \u201c the mainstream media \u201d posed a major threat .\nThat \u2019 s more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donald Trump , Joe Biden , the Republican Party , the Democratic Party , the Supreme Court , the federal government , and the Electoral College .\nThat \u2019 s right , the biggest threat to democracy comes from the mainstream media .\nNow this poll result , even more than most , should be taken with a big grain of salt .\nOne of the major takeaways from the poll was totally nuts ; 59 percent of 71 percent is 42 percent \u2013 so , technically speaking , a majority of Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media is a major threat to democracy ; People can easily have wildly different views of what \u201c threatens democracy \u201d means ; Trump voters were three times more likely than Biden voters to consider the media a major threat to democracy , presumably for dramatically different reasons .\nBut the biggest problem with all of these polls on the media is the pollsters \u2019 refusal to distinguish between the different forms of media .\nIf you are a reality-based person and you consider Fox \u201c News \u201d as a major part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course you think the news media is a major threat democracy .\nContrarily , if you are a MAGA/Qanon type who happily wallows in disinformation and racist vitriol , then you think truth-tellers are a menace to society .\nAnd you \u2019 ve been hearing the leaders you trust say so , endlessly , over the last six-plus years .\nSo part of this negative attitude toward the mainstream media is not really the mainstream media \u2019 s fault .\nYou certainly wouldn \u2019 t want them to stop truth-telling to win over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least partly the mainstream media \u2019 s fault that it has failed to effectively champion the truth , allowing misinformation to take such a hold .\nAnd I suspect a considerable fraction of the reality-based community is disgusted with the mushy both-sidesism they get from places like the New York Times , and more generally with the profound failure of journalism as a whole to evangelize the truth to the deluded .\nIf you asked me , yeah , I \u2019 d say the New York Times and its ilk constitute a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned their natural role as its great defenders .\nFox , however , is uniquely problematic , both in terms of its affect on public opinion and how including it as part of the \u201c media \u201d makes public opinion about the media incoherent .\nWe desperately need to stop calling Fox news , and stop categorizing it as news .\nIt \u2019 s the opposite of news .\nAs a major vector of disinformation , propaganda and violent Christian nationalism , it \u2019 s a news story , not news .\nIndeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask these days is : \u201c Where do you get your news ?\n\u201d And then they should let people see how that makes all the difference .\nTo its credit , the NYT/Siena poll did ask \u201c what single news source do you turn to most often ?\n\u201d ( Fox News was No .\n1 , at 19 percent .\nThe only others that came even close were the network news shows , collectively , and \u201c social media \u201d . )\nBut the Times doesn \u2019 t let us see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That \u2019 s not one of the official \u201c crosstabs.\n\u201d It should be .\n( I \u2019 ve asked . )\nThe public \u2019 s disgust with the \u201c mainstream news \u201d or \u201c mass media \u201d \u2013 whatever that is \u2014 is obviously nothing new .\nGallup recently found that only 34 percent of Americans trust in the mass media \u2013 defined as \u201c newspapers , TV and radio \u201c \u2014 to report the news \u201c fully , accurately and fairly \u201d .\nIt was even lower \u2013 32 percent \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did note that it was \u201c the first time that the percentage of Americans with no trust at all in the media is higher than the percentage with a great deal or a fair amount combined.\n\u201d Meanwhile , however , our newsroom leaders will continue to do what they do , satisfied that if \u201c both sides \u201d are unhappy , they must be hitting the sweet spot .\nHow clueless are they ?\nConsider what former New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet told the Guardian \u2019 s Ed Pilkington , @ @ @ @

Times is making a mockery of democracy fears", "content": "In a front-page story on Sunday ostensibly about how \u201c fears of democracy \u201d are playing out in real-world Wisconsin , New York Times reporter Jonathan Weisman instead equated legitimate fears with illegitimate ones , and used man-on-the-street interviews to make a mockery of the deep , abiding concerns that many Americans have about the future of their country .\nThat he could have written this paragraph \u2013 and that who-knows-how-many layers of editors could have approved it \u2013 is the ultimate testament to the New York Times \u2019 s grotesquely warped and failed approach to covering this critical moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be clear .\nSaying that something factual \u201c depends on who you talk to \u201d is not accurate .\nYes , as NYU professor Jay Rosen noted , it \u2019 s a tried and true device reporters use to introduce both-sidesism .\nAnd it works just fine when it \u2019 s a matter of opinion .\n\u201c Whether the most morally corrupt team in baseball is the Astros or the Phillies depends on who you talk to \u201d is a perfectly reasonable statement .\nBut what Weisman was doing \u2013 knowingly , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a toss-up between those terrified by the very real possibility of the Republican Party seizing absolute power , on the one hand , and right-wing conspiracy theorists who see brown people and socialist elites as scary , on the other .\nHe also used the \u201c depends on who you ask \u201d structure as an excuse to echo and essentially validate right-wing lunacy .\nWhat they call \u201c indoctrination \u201d is trying to teach empathy .\nImmigrants are not replacing white voters .\nAnd the idea that \u201c widening access to voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d is utterly specious , but Weisman make the assertion in his own voice and doesn \u2019 t dispute it .\nYou can imagine the contempt dripping from Weisman \u2019 s lips , the implied italics , as he wrote : \u201c Wisconsin would seem like a state where concerns over democracy feel pressing.\n\u201d He briefly acknowledged that Wisconsin , \u201c perhaps more than any other state , is suffering through the erosion of democratic ideals already.\n\u201d For instance : \u201c Though virtually every elected statewide officer here is a Democrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has given Republicans near supermajorities in the State Senate and House.\n\u201d But in another classic of mealy-mouthed both-sidesing , Weisman set up the second half of his article \u2013 based on , presumably , a handful of interviews during a brief visit to Lacrosse \u2013 with this paragraph : Then he mocked legitimate democracy fears by choosing as his first man-on-the-street interview a bicycle and pedestrian safety consultant named Peter Flucke , who Weisman wrote sees the \u201c unraveling of democratic control.. [ n ] ot in the grainy images of lawlessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in rising death tolls in Wisconsin \u2019 s crosswalks and bike lanes.\n\u201d Weisman acknowledges that Flucke intends to vote Democratic , \u201c though not because of all this democracy talk.\n\u201d Rather , Weisman writes , it \u2019 s because Flucke said \u201c he is most worried about his two daughters losing their right to choose an abortion.\n\u201d As usual , when a story is this skewed , this grotesque , I can \u2019 t just blame the author .\nAssigning Weisman to write this story was , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of New York Times editors .\nWeissman is not one of those reporters who can be accused of having a \u201c view from nowhere \u201d \u2013 the alleged detachment that journalists claim when refusing to take sides on a political issue .\nRather , he has a long and well-documented track record of toxicity toward Democrats and minorities .\nHe consistently makes elitist , clueless and simply wrong assumptions .\nAnd he is perhaps the most pompous writer at the Times , which is saying a lot .\nThe Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real , justified fears of a slide into authoritarianism .\nBut , as I wrote in June , the \u201c Democracy Team \u201d is outnumbered and outgunned by the likes of Weisman , who make up Team Impunity .\nThey \u2019 re the ones who turn their own failure \u2014 as the tone-setters of American political journalism \u2013 to properly alarm the public about what may to come into clickbait stories about how apathetic and polarized people are .\nThere \u2019 s simply no excuse for assigning and publishing articles that split the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a referendum is coming up .\nWeisman \u2019 s not going to change .\nBut does the new editor of the Times , Joe Kahn

of forgetting is one of the worst lapses there can be in journalism.\n\u201d But it was Sherrilyn Ifill , the extraordinary civil rights lawyer whose Twitter feed is one of my moral touchstones on social media , who raised the idea that maybe these journalists simply can \u2019 t imagine a loss of democracy \u2014 or their privileged role in society .\n\u201c I think many/most journalists at MSM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy \u2019 means .\nIt \u2019 s like air to them .\nThat \u2019 s why they worry they \u2019 re \u2018 crossing the line , ' \u201d Ifill wrote .\nRuth Ben-Ghiat , an expert on totalitarian regimes , agreed .\n\u201c This is my impression sometimes when I am interviewed about democracy and authoritarianism , \u201d she wrote .\nAnd then Nikole Hannah-Jones pointed out what \u2019 s missing from those newsrooms .\n\u201c Yes .\nThis is why Black journalists and the traditions of the Black press are so critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that democracy has been and is always contested and fragile , and at times missing altogether.\n\u201d Hannah-Jones , as I \u2019 ve written before , is a brave and brilliant truth-teller .\nShe now runs the Center for Journalism & Democracy at Howard University , which is holding a Democracy Summit on Nov. 15 , in part to reexamine \u201c the journalism profession \u2019 s central concepts of fact , objectivity , fairness and balance.\n\u201d The summit takes as a given that , in the face of \u201c anti-democratic forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c an unworkable approach and a crisis for our profession and our country.\n\u201d Hannah-Jones \u2019 s tweet suggests that the lack of diversity in our top newsrooms \u2013 often acknowledged as a representation problem , and as creating a blind spot about the role of race and racism in politics \u2013 also creates a sense of false comfort about our democracy .\nO \u2019 Brien gave Ifill an amen .\n\u201c Yes .\nEvery time somebody tells me \u2018 this is not who we are \u2019 or \u2018 I \u2019 m absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like maybe they should read a book about American history , \u201d she wrote .\nMatthew Sheffield , a formerly right-wing journalist who now works for the left-wing Young Turks online news show , raised an issue related to the urban , upper-class backgrounds of so many elite journalists : \u201c I think the root of this issue is that the vast majority of journos never had any real contact w the religion-based authoritarianism which took total control of the GOP after the Tea Party .\nIt \u2019 s still not real to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watch is devoted to the principle that in the current political climate , journalists need to change the rules of the game .\nThat \u2019 s never been more clear , as this brain trust made clear .\n\u201c When the two major political parties were at least in agreement that democracy should be protected it was easier , \u201d Ifill wrote .\n\u201c Once Trump erased the lines & the Republican Party abandoned allegiance to democracy , it forced a set of questions many journalists are ill-equipped to answer.\n\u201d Rosen summarized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree .\nTheir practices ran on a mental picture of two roughly similar parties with different ideologies that fought it out during elections to see who could rouse more voters to their side .\nAs the GOP abandoned its allegiance to democracy , this consensus understanding gave way , \u201d he wrote : \u201c When the \u2018 don \u2019 t take sides \u2019 commandment meets a lopsided story like , \u2018 we have a two-party system and one of the two has turned anti-democratic , \u2019 people in newsrooms hesitate because they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their code : stay balanced vs. say what is , \u201d he continued .\nThe real-life result is garbage like a front-page New York Times story I wrote about last week , in which the author wrote that \u201c just what is threatening democracy depends on who you talk to.\n\u201d Or , like an execrable Washington Post article on Monday claiming that \u201c people on both sides of the partisan split \u201d share the \u201c hope that the country can be put back together again.\n\u201d Greg Sargent agreed with Rosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference between his reported opinion column for the Washington Post , which is unflinching in its descriptions of the dangers we face , and the work of his colleagues on the news side .\n\u201c The idea that \u2018 one party is abandoning democracy and the other isn \u2019 t \u2019 requires journos to arrive at a baseline conviction on what democratic values are and why they matter , and that \u2019 s not something that was expected of them before , \u201d Sargent wrote .\nIfill \u2019 s comments made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that all of us who are worried about the threat to democracy are just being shrill and hysterical .\nThat would be crazy , but also very true to type .\nRosen insisted that it \u2019 s more that they think it \u2019 s a partisan issue , and therefore needs to be treated symmetrically .\nI think it \u2019 s some of both .\nNewmark asked a deceptively simple question : \u201c When a publication engages in false equivalence , both-sidesism , or otherwise amplifies falsehoods , could professional journalists call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course .\nAnd some of us do .\nBut the owners of news organizations have largely fired their \u201c public editors \u201d \u2013 who once used to bring widespread public concerns to their attention .\nProfessional media critics \u2013 and there are vanishingly few of us \u2013 are marginalized by elite journalists , who turn out to be remarkably defensive .\nAnd the people within these institutions \u2013 even once they leave \u2013 seem to feel that collegiality requires them to keep quiet about the failings of their profession .\nThat \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must speak out , because the stakes are simply too high .", "author": "Dan Froomkin", "url":

teams\u201d let democracy down", "content": "The article by two members of the seven-person team , Amy Gardner and Rosalind S. Helderman , had a promising headline : \u201c Midterms pose fresh test for American democracy after two years under fire \u201c .\nBut its ambiguous nut graph made it clear that they utterly misunderstood their duty to their readers : Scrutiny of the \u201c mechanics of voting \u201d ?\nThose are not the tests for democracy we face .\n\u201c Republican election deniers poised to take positions of power \u201d \u2013 that \u2019 s closer .\nBut the real test for democracy is the installation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they can steal future elections .\nThe real test for democracy is the ongoing Republican intimidation and disenfranchisement of voters .\nThe real test for democracy is whether Republicans respond to elections they lose with violence and demented conspiracy theories .\nThe real test for democracy is that one of our major parties is willing to traffic in lies and cruelty and racism to incite its base into paroxysms of white Christian nationalism .\nThe real test for democracy is the spread of disinformation that cons people into voting against their interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the failure of the media to effectively assert reality .\nVoters aren \u2019 t \u201c uncertain \u201d about the process this time around .\nBut if things go the way they \u2019 re looking , every American will have cause to be uncertain next time around .\nSo my question for the democracy teams is : Did you ever understand ?\nOr were you not allowed to ?\nOver at the Times The New York Times has its \u201c democracy team , \u201d too .\nIt \u2019 s more of the same .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Charles Homans , made their closing argument on Monday and they missed the point , too , in a story headlined \u201c Fears and Suspicion Hang Over Voting on Cusp of Election Day.\n\u201d The passive construction gives the people who did this a pass .\nLet me rewrite that for you : The article wasn \u2019 t a complete disaster .\nFifteen paragraphs in , the authors stuck in a little truth-telling : But that acknowledgement was too little , too late .\nI was genuinely psyched when the Post launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should have known better .\nThe clues were right there in the mealy-mouthed mission statement .\nThese reporters weren \u2019 t charged with countering the extraordinarily , unparalleled threat the modern Republican Party poses to democracy .\nThey were asked to document \u201c battles over voting rules and access to the polls , efforts to sow doubt about elections and erosion of trust in the democratic process.\n\u201d How do you cover an assault on democracy if you only identify the victim ?\nThe Washington Post is afraid to speak the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .\nAnd I suspect it comes from the very top .\nWell , not necessarily owner Jeff Bezos or his empty-suit publisher Fred Ryan .\nBut from the person Bezos chose to run his newsroom : the wildly disappointing Sally Buzbee .\nAsked over the summer whether threats to democracy are coming more from Republicans than Democrats \u2013 this is an easy one !\n\u2013 she balked .\n\u201c I mean , if it \u2019 s Republicans who are doing it , if it \u2019 s Democrats who are doing it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that out , \u201d she said .\nSo there you have it .\nThe democracy team was always a joke .\nAnd it \u2019 s the same at the Times .\nThe goal of its \u201c Democracy Challenged \u201d coverage is not to expose the risk of becoming a fascist state , it \u2019 s to write about how \u201c Democratic norms are facing a historic test .\nMany Americans doubt the results of the 2020 election , and extremism , global authoritarianism and disinformation are on the rise.\n\u201d The other team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m not sure how much good a serious , functioning democracy team would have done either at the Post or at the Times given how outnumbered and outgunned they were by what I call Team Impunity \u2013 the hackish political reporters whose both-sides horserace coverage dominates the front pages .\nSee , for instance , the New York Times front page on Monday .\nTop of the fold : Lisa Lerer , Jennifer Medina and Jonathan Weisman don \u2019 t tell you what \u2019 s at stake , they report that voters \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their personal safety and fears about the fundamental stability of American democracy\u2026 showed clear signs of preparing to reject Democratic control of Washington and embrace divided government.\n\u201d And star reporter Peter Baker also didn \u2019 t tell you what \u2019 s at stake .\nHe wrote about how \u201c As Midterms Near , Biden Faces a Nation as Polarized as Ever \u201c .\nThis on the eve of what could be a huge step toward authoritarianism .\nJust the other day , Baker \u2019 s colleague Jonathan Weisman made a mockery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , just what is threatening democracy depends on who you talk to.\n\u201d Even at their best , the democracy teams pulled their punches .\nAt their worst , they gave comfort to the wrong people .\nA May 21 Washington Post article by Amy Gardner and Matthew Brown cast a surge of voting in the Georgia primary as \u201c undercutting \u201d Democratic claims that a new election law would make it harder to cast a ballot .\nA more accurate framing would have indicated that the surge was a testament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked to overcome those barriers .\nTo her credit , Amy Gardner of the Post has relentlessly chronicled and counted the election-deniers on the ballot .\nBut she failed to explain what that means .\nHer August 15 article , \u201c Election deniers march toward power in key 2024 battlegrounds \u201d was full of crucial information , but she choked on her nut graph .\nIf people willing to steal elections are in positions of power in 2024 , the risk is not that they will \u201c delay the result , undermine confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeds of civil strife.\n\u201d It is that they will steal elections for Republicans forevermore .\nAnother terrific Gardner piece , on October 12 , found that \u201c A majority of GOP nominees deny or question the 2020 election results \u201c .\nBut Gardner again punted on the consequences , leaving \u201c experts \u201d to make understated conclusions about the \u201c willingness among election-denying candidates to undermine democratic institutions when it benefits their side.\n\u201d Experts ?\nReally ?\nBy now , these democracy team members should be the experts themselves .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences , in their own voice .\nThe New York Times also did some standout reporting about the hundreds of Republican midterm candidates who \u201c have questioned or spread misinformation about the 2020 election \u201d and \u201c represent a growing consensus in the Republican Party , and a potential threat to American democracy.\n\u201d But they didn \u2019 t address why they \u2019 re doing this .\nThe goal of the Republican Party is to decouple politics from reality , and seize power regardless of the will of the voters .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Times \u2019 s \u201c Democracy Challenged \u201d series was written by David Leonhardt , the guy who both-sided Covid .\nLeonhardt identified what he called the \u201c twin threats to democracy.\n\u201d One is \u201c a growing movement inside one of the country \u2019 s two major parties \u2014 the Republican Party \u2014 to refuse to accept defeat in an election.\n\u201d But the other , he wrote , is that government power \u201c is becoming increasingly disconnected from public opinion.\n\u201d Those are twin threats like Schwarzenegger and DeVito .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ say so , counter-majoritarianism is also a Republican phenomenon . )\nHe both-sided polarization : \u201c The divergent sense of crisis on left and right can itself weaken democracy , and it has been exacerbated by technology , \u201d he wrote .\nWorst of all , he insisted that some Republican support for \u201c aggressive tactics \u201d is \u201c rooted in anxiety over real developments , including illegal immigration and \u2018 cancel culture \u2019 .\n\u201d But in reality , it \u2019 s rooted in racism and bathed in corporate money .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively making excuses for racists and bigots .\nBy their word choice ye shall know them .\nSo read what Patrick Marley , Rosalind S. Helderman and Tom Hamburger wrote in the Post on October 25 about pro-Trump election volunteers : Doubt ?\nDoubt ?\n?\nHow about intimidation and violence ?\nI \u2019 ve noticed that a lot of the disappointing democracy coverage uses the word \u201c doubt \u201d a lot \u2014 as in doubting the results .\nIt \u2019 s also in both newspaper \u2019 s mission statements .\nI guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become an acceptable way to address and lump together the addled right-wing conspiracy theories on the one hand , and the legitimate concerns of normal Americans on the other .\nBut \u201c doubt \u201d is a Republican talking point , it \u2019 s not an acceptable frame for democracy coverage .\nThere has been no widespread doubt about the election process until Republicans started yelling about alleged voter fraud , which never really existed , in order to effectively reinstate poll taxes .\nIt wasn \u2019 t a serious issue for presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democrats were going to steal the election .\nDemocracy is in danger , of that there is no doubt .\nMeanwhile , our top newsrooms just sit there , as if it were business as usual .", "author": "Dan Froomkin", "url":

phenomenon that its members can blame on polls or spin .\nEver since they started handicapping the 2022 election \u2013 which means almost all the way back to 2020 \u2013 leading political reporters and pundits consistently predicted a midterm shellacking for Joe Biden and Democrats .\nIt \u2019 s almost like they were looking forward to it .\nThey never even considered that voters might reject extremism .\nNo wonder they didn \u2019 t see it coming .\nThey wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s low approval ratings .\nThey wrote about the undeniable historical trends .\nAnd more recently , they wrote relentlessly , about inflation as a Democratic albatross , even though it was a global phenomenon being exploited by fossil-fuel and grocery-store giants .\nAfter the Dobbs decision , they briefly entertained the notion that things might go another way .\nBut then they dismissed it entirely .\nBy contrast , what any responsible , halfway-intelligent and not coopted political reporter should have been asking , over and over again , is : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s attempt to steal the election , after a violent right-wing assault on the Capitol , and with the GOP swearing fealty to MAGA , spreading vile conspiracy theories about white replacement , and accusing teachers of grooming \u2014 how could America possibly vote for Republicans ever again ?\nAs time went on , as Trump got even more unhinged , as the conspiracy theories got even more vile , and as a far-right Christian nationalist Supreme Court began rolling back hard-won freedoms , the real story of the 2022 election was clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election .\nIt would be an election that could irreparably harm our democracy and head us straight toward a Christian autocracy .\nIf things went really badly , it might be the last fair election we ever had .\nAnd it was certainly not the time for journalists to sit back , relax , and calmly write stories about what the polls and pundits were saying was going to happen .\nBe treating a major Republican victory in 2022 as a foregone conclusion , the media didn \u2019 t just get it wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal people to seriously consider voting for an extremist , nativist , anti-governance party .\nIt \u2019 s kind of a miracle we survived .\nAs I wrote in Press Watch \u2019 s mission statement over a year ago , it presumes that there will be zero accountability for lying and extremism .\nAnd let \u2019 s be clear .\nA lot of us have been begging the mainstream media to reconsider its glib predictions of Republican victory for a long time .\nWe welcome all the new arrivals .\nBut this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not just a function of the political media \u2019 s predeliction to predict results rather than write about voters and policy .\nThis laid bare the rot of the current political-media industry .\nThis is not something that can be fixed with a little tweaking , and weak stabs at contrition .\nWhat we need is a wholesale revisiting of the rules of modern political journalism .\nAnd it \u2019 s not like these reporters and editors didn \u2019 t understand the stakes \u2013 they just compartmentalized them , then refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wheezing journalistic algorithms required that they not write anything that might indicate that one party or argument is superior to another .\nSo they focused on the contest instead of the context .\nAnd then they lost touch with the contest .\nI \u2019 d ask you to revisit a column I wrote last November : \u201c Handicapping the midterm elections ?\nLet me rewrite that for you.\n\u201d What killed me was that these reporters filed the occasional \u2013 really excellent !\n\u2014 story illustrating how the modern Republican Party has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shameless , and untethered to reality .\nBut those very same reporters , day in and day out , calmly predicted Republican victory .\nThey took as a given that there would be , as usual , an energetic backlash against the ruling party .\nThey made exhaustive note of all the causes for dissatisfaction with Democrats .\nAnd they considered it inconceivable that the public might somehow hold Republicans accountable for their transgressions and the threat they pose to traditional American values .\nThey should have connected the two , and written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then they should have put all their resources toward exploring how that could possibly be , and whether such a fate was truly inevitable .\nI suggested any number of ways they could have done that .\nI proposed they examine : \u2022 The failure \u2013 on the part of the Democratic Party and the media \u2013 to properly stigmatize Trump and his enablers for their lies , corruption , rule-breaking and incitements to violence , culminating in a violent coup attempt .\n\u2022 The country \u2019 s rigid two-party system not offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservatives .\n\u2022 Republican tribalism , such that party affiliation and loyalty are defining and unquestioned .\n\u2022 A significant subset of voters who would welcome an authoritarian , white Christian government .\n\u2022 The united front presented by today \u2019 s Republican leaders and their lockstep refusal to acknowledge any wrongdoing ( unlike after Watergate ) .\n\u2022 Negative media coverage of Biden and the Democrats .\n\u2022 The illogic of cyclic bitterness toward the ruling party , whichever it is .\nI have basically begged senior newsroom editors for over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with their reporters , take stock , think things through , and ask themselves some tough questions , starting with : \u201c Do we really think we \u2019 re doing a good job of educating the American public ?\n\u201d The second question should have been : \u201c Are we really so sure they \u2019 re going to win ?\n\u201d If there was ever a wake-up call for the media ( and the nation ) about the stakes , it was the Supreme Court \u2019 s decision to overturn Roe v. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , \u201c Dear political reporters : You \u2019 ve got your election narrative now \u201c .\nSuddenly , the long American story of expanded civil rights was over .\nIn the new story , America was headed straight toward Christian theocracy , unless the people rose up .\nI pointed out that the way voting is already skewed to favor Republicans \u2013 through gerrymandering , voter suppression , and the existence of the Senate \u2013 a majority wouldn \u2019 t be enough , only a supermajority .\nHere was a clarion-call to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the topic from \u201c inevitable Republican victory \u201d to \u201c dramatic inflection point ahead \u201d .\nWhen gas prices shot up , I pointed out , the political narrative shifted dramatically , with inflation becoming the central theme of midterm coverage .\nFreedom was more important than gas prices , I argued , to no avail .\nAnd nothing exposed the moral rot of the media more clearly than its willingness to jump on the \u201c out of control crime \u201d bandwagon \u2013 even as they ( at least once ) acknowledged it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top newsrooms downplay hugely important assaults on cherished American values , but idiotically fall for

fraud \u201d for decades .\nIt was \u201c critical race theory \u201d in public schools in 2021 .\nAnd this year it was \u201c crime \u201d .\nThey had one last chance to call out the cruelty , lack of humanity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans when GOP leaders chortled over the hammer attack of Paul Pelosi .\nBut they covered it as a footnote .\nOur elite news organizations pride themselves in their investigative stories , uncovering malfeasance and corruption .\nBut they can \u2019 t seem to recognize the existential crises right under their nose .\nThey \u2019 ve entirely given up on political accountability .\nAnd yet they still think they \u2019 re doing things right .\nIn the wake of this latest embarrassing failure , they still can \u2019 t admit any structural problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reporters trying to point fingers ( at Trump , at pollsters , at each other ) and coming up with inane explanations of both what happened and why they were so wrong about it .\nWashington Post political reporter-turned-columnist Dana Milbank never fell for the red-wave rhetoric , and wrote on Wednesday that the poll numbers actually showed the contests remained tight .\nIt was the analysis that was flawed .\n\u201c Political journalists were suckered by a wave of Republican junk polls in the closing weeks of the campaign , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe analysis was wrong because of long-held , preconceived notions , not because some operative snookered them .\nMilbank himself raised the possibility that the New York Times-Siena College poll \u2014 which spawned a last-minute deluge of articles about how voters are swinging Republican because they don \u2019 t care about democracy just inflation \u2013 was ( intentionally ?\nunintentionally ? )\nskewed .\nSome of the weighted results were clearly nonsensical , suggestive of people trying to make the data fit their preconceptions .\nSimilarly , when a Politico poll found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than for Republicans , Politico dismissed its own poll as an \u201c outlier \u201d .\nIt just couldn \u2019 t be .\nAnd now , having to act all surprised that , apparently , American voters are not so far gone after all , mainstream journalists are making further asses of themselves.. New York Times reporters Lisa Lerer came up with a particularly repulsive and condescending explanation for normal voters rejecting MAGA .\n\u201c The very polarization of the country functioned as a check , as the passions of one side offset the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homepage of the Washington Post on Thursday morning declared that Republicans lost not because their fascism and misogyny might be turning young voters and others off , but because of tactical errors .\nOur top political reporters are so \u201c surprised \u201d that they are blind to what Elie Mystal explained in The Nation is \u201c the real narrative , \u201d that \u201c If Republicans do in fact win control of the House , there is a primary reason for their success : they gerrymandered themselves to victory.\n\u201d We can fix

.\nFroomkin : Yes of course I \u2019 m saying you didn \u2019 t do enough .\nAnd the proof is right there in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf people are not alarmed about this , then you have failed to do your job of educating the public , and you should reconsider how you do it .\nThere have been a handful of terrific \u2013 really excellent \u2014 articles in both the Times and the Post , but by and large the \u201c democracy \u201d coverage has been insufficient , underplayed , and anemically written .\nIt has also been drowned out by the daily dirge of contextless horserace coverage that , by treating both sides as equally plausible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerously delusional , deceptive , racist , misogynistic and authoritarian Republican Party , and its intent to become a permanent ruling minority .\nReaders are increasingly fed up with both-sidesing .\nYou must know that .\nDo you really think that \u2019 s some position of moral superiority ?\nI can \u2019 t even imagine what your colleagues are thinking when they write something like : \u201c Of course , just what is threatening democracy depends on who you talk to.\n\u201d Consider this article just today about suburban women voters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Many felt freedom itself was under threat , whether the freedom they sought was the right to abortion or the right to shield their children from what they considered objectionable ideas on gender and race.\n\u201d Does anyone in your building really equate those two \u201c freedoms \u201d ?\nOr actually think what is threatening democracy depends on who you talk to ?\nHell no .\nThen why write like that ?\nIt \u2019 s a tremendous disservice to readers , to democracy , to the nation , and ultimately to yourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ litany of political journalism that fails to speak the truth at a moment of potential catastrophe .\nAs you know , you personally have been a frequent target \u2013 for whitewashing Ron DeSantis \u2019 s overt fascism , downplaying the 1/6 committee \u2019 s findings , even giving advice to would-be authoritarians back in June .\nYou are hardly an uninterested party .\nHounshell : Meanwhile , it seems to me that the larger problem is that people who embrace conspiracy theories about elections aren \u2019 t even reading mainstream political coverage at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news from a random Twitter account like catturd or Steve Bannon \u2019 s podcast of some email forward .\nThat , to me , seems like a greater threat to democracy than whether horserace coverage frames each side \u2019 s arguments in the manner you would prefer .\nFroomkin : Of course it \u2019 s a disaster for democracy that people have succumbed to manufacturers of disinformation .\nIn fact , it \u2019 s possibly the biggest news story of the moment .\nIt \u2019 s the fuel of the far-right that threatens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , not to mention condemn it .\nYou yourself still refer to Fox News , its lead purveyor , as \u201c the nation \u2019 s most powerful cable news \u201d \u2014 instead of calling it what it is : a propaganda network that spreads disinformation and racist filth .\nAren \u2019 t you offended by what Fox has done to \u201c news \u201d ?\nThat disinformation is so rampant is partly the Times \u2019 s fault , too .\nYour colleagues don \u2019 t champion the truth with anywhere near the ferocity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the horserace genre that you and your Politico-trained colleagues value so much actively obscures meaning .\nYour article \u201c Republicans Sharpen Their Message on Ukraine , \u201d for instance , was a stunning example of how Times political reporters don \u2019 t seem to care whether what Republicans say is true , or fair .\nAll they care about is whether it works .\nYou and your colleagues think your mostly liberal audience doesn \u2019 t need to be hit over the head with this stuff , but the Times ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mainstream media as a whole .\nYou assume that everyone who votes Republican ignores mainstream political coverage , but that \u2019 s not true .\nA lot of unaffiliated voters watch the network news , read their local newspapers , or even the New York Times .\nWhen the Times \u2019 s political coverage is anemic , so is CBS News \u2019 s and so is the local paper \u2019 s .\nYou can \u2019 t play split-the-difference on the truth , then say it \u2019 s not your fault they believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with the corporate culture of our major newsrooms , and nowhere is that more destructive to democracy than in yours .\nAs I wrote for The Nation in May , the

journalistic values ?\nWhat should you do ?\nYou should have front-page banner headlines every day over articles that make absolutely clear what an inflection point we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over articles about the fact that Republicans have put forth no plausible solutions to inflation , and in fact quite the opposite \u2014 not that Republicans are winning on this issue , or \u201c are divided over

addresses the threat to democracy , you should respond not with stenography and both-siding , but by telling your readers , based on the evidence and your informed , nonpartisan judgement : Is he right or is he wrong ?\nNone of us are asking you to be partisan , or to be blind to the many faults of the Democratic Party .\nBut by normalizing what the Republican Party has become , you are @ @ @

the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you are misunderstanding an alternate story format trying to unpack why some Republicans who crossed Trump survived and why some didn \u2019 t .\nSo there you have it .\nI think I won .\nBut even if I did , I get no prize for that .\nWe can fix American political journalism .\nWe just have to keep plugging away , keep making our voices heard .\nPlease help me do that

four core constituencies : Their editors , their sources , their peers , and right-wing trolls .\nThe public \u2013 and the obligation to accurately inform the public \u2013 just doesn \u2019 t rank

a MAGA-led party too extreme and dangerous to vote for .\nWhy ?\nBecause going against the conventional wisdom is a great way to get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and right-wing trolls .\nSome of us \u2013 media critics , activists , citizens \u2014 were pleading with them all along to sound the alarm over the extraordinary , unprecedented threat to democracy coming from a party that doesn \u2019 t accept losing , doesn \u2019 t reject violence , and is unwilling to break with extremists .\nWe begged them to see that the possibility such a party might win was not something to write about glibly , but was a clarion call for journalism that forcefully advocated for democracy and proactively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poisoned the public discourse .\nIf you \u2019 re a top political reporter , here is whose

incredible bravery of their colleague Peter Baker , who definitively declared in Friday \u2019 s Times that Donald Trump has \u201c embraced extremism \u201d .\nBut as usual with the New York Times , it \u2019 s way too little , way too late .\nIndeed , every baby step the New York Times takes toward recognizing the extraordinary danger posed by elements of the Republican Party to our democracy and our polity only further exposes how far they still have to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump has now aligned himself \u201c with forces that used to be outside the mainstream of American politics.\n\u201d The appropriate wording is \u201c with forces whose views are so abhorrent that they have historically been shunned by all respectable people and institutions.\n\u201d And is the New York Times really saying that antisemitism , white supremacy , and sedition are now \u201c within the mainstream \u201d ?\nBecause by saying those forces \u201c used to be outside the mainstream of American politics , \u201d Baker is tacitly accepting that they are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baker believes , then he should have made that the headline : \u201c Trump has brought antisemitism and white supremacy into the mainstream of American politics.\n\u201d Baker writes that Trump \u2019 s \u201c antigovernment jeremiads lately sound like those once relegated to the outer edges of the political spectrum.\n\u201d Well , yes , but what does that mean ?\nTwo thirds of Republican voters still love him .\nHe remains the head of a major political party .\nHe can not therefore be at the outer edge of the political spectrum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u201c By engaging in antigovernment jeremiads that were once considered the provenance of lunatics and Nazis , Trump has pushed the American political spectrum off its foundations .\nHe has opened the door wide to antisemitism and white supremacy .\nIt is the obligation of any reasonable person or institution to do everything in their power to close that door firmly .\nAnd the Republican Party is not doing so.\n\u201d The lead of the story isn \u2019 t even news : Trump has made it very clear many times already that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to storm the Capitol , and against the law .\n\u201c He stands with the mob \u201d is a good paragraph .\nBut the news is his sitting down at a meal and figuratively , if not literally , embracing extremely public proponents of antisemitism and white supremacy .\nReading this article , you may wonder : Where has Peter Baker been for the last several years ?\nHe writes that it is only now \u2013 after the leader of the far-right Oath Keepers militia was convicted \u2013 that Trump can be placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seditious conspiracy.\n\u201d I guess that wasn \u2019 t clear to Baker before .\nIt was to the rest of us .\n\u201c The trial effectively established that there was an illegal plot to keep Mr. Trump in power despite his defeat in the 2020 election , \u201d Baker writes .\nThe trial may have \u201c legally \u201d established that , but it was effectively established a long time ago \u2013 certainly after the January 6 committee hearings .\nHow empty-headed is Peter Baker ?\nHe evidently considers it possible that Trump had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe it was just a coincidence !\nRead that over again .\nBaker believes the trial \u201c made clear that this was more than a peaceful protest that simply got out of hand.\n\u201d To whom was that not already clear ?\nHis sentence construction is tentative \u2013 minimizing the worst-case scenario while allowing for the possibility that we don \u2019 t really know yet what happened , and that maybe Trump has just been misunderstood .\nHe writes about Trump \u2019 s \u201c acceptance , if not outright courtship , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even \u201c outright courtship , \u201d Peter .\nIt \u2019 s \u201c outright incitement.\n\u201d The most fundamental problem with the article is that \u201c extremism \u201d is way too weak a word for what Trump has \u201c embraced.\n\u201d Extremism is threatening to tank the world economy unless we cut Social Security .\nExtremism is launching a congressional investigation of the January 6 committee .\nExtremism is preparing to impeach Joe Biden for who-knows-what .\nBy contrast , the overt racism and antisemitism and sedition that Trump is now embracing is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond that .\nIt is absolutely abhorrent conduct that shouldn \u2019 t be considered acceptable in American society , and hasn \u2019 t been , for decades .\nBut for Baker , it \u2019 s all euphemisms and sorry similes .\nTrump \u2019 s \u201c former dinner guests fanned the flames on Thursday , \u201d he writes , for example by saying \u201c I like Hitler.\n\u201d What flames ?\nTell me what flames , Peter ?\nIt would be great if you acknowledged that by embracing them , Trump is giving oxygen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you don \u2019 t say that do you ?\nIt \u2019 s just vaguely fans and flames .\nThere \u2019 s one chilling quote in the story , from Ruth Ben-Ghiat , the expert on authoritarianism , but it catches her talking tactics rather than morality : \u201c For someone of Trump \u2019 s temperament , being humiliated by people turning away from him will only make him more desperate and more inclined to support and associate with the most extremist elements of society , \u201d she said .\nBaker \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fantasy world of political strategists and gullible reporters where the Republican Party remains a normal political party .\n\u201c Republican critics worry the move taints the party at a time when it needs to broaden its support , \u201d Baker writes , quoting one Republican political strategist .\nHe repeatedly contrasts Trump with the \u201c Republican establishment \u201d and \u201c Republican officeholders , led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.\n\u201d ( How many Republican officeholders would agree with that characterization ? )\n\u201c Mr .\nTrump \u2019 s expanding embrace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure out how to distance themselves from him , \u201d Baker writes .\nIn reality , a staggering 95 percent of Republican midterm voters held a favorable view of Trump .\nEven Baker \u2019 s strongest critiques are muted .\nConsider : That may seem bold at first glance .\nBut Trump has not \u201c flirted \u201d with the \u201c fringes \u201d .\nHe has succored them .\nHe has not \u201c appealed \u201d to prejudice .\nHe is actively inciting prejudice and endangering Americans .\nBaker ends by quoting yet another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether Trump is just pretending to adhere to fringe conspiracy theories , or whether he \u2019 s actually bought in .\nThat \u2019 s a stupid question .\nMy question is : What more will it take for journalistic institutions like the Times to acknowledge that what Trump is saying requires condemnation , not speculation .", "author": "Dan Froomkin", "url":

Times newsroom have rarely been laid out as clearly as they were on Saturday , when it published an article by Jeremy Peters headlined \u201c Critics Say Musk Has Revealed Himself as a Conservative .\nIt \u2019 s Not So Simple.\n\u201d And it wasn \u2019 t just Peters adopting this ridiculous argument .\nHis editor , and their editor , and a whole slew of other editors either actively approved of the article or chose not to say anything and let it get published .\nHow , you might well ask , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrated newsroom bring forth something so laughably , ludicrously wrong

short , by valuing reporters like Jeremy Peters .\nIn the article , Peters himself acknowledged that \u201c to many of his critics , \u201d Musk \u2019 s \u201c relentless flurry of tweets in the six weeks since he took over Twitter has exposed his true conservative bent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the social network more susceptible to right-wing misinformation.\n\u201d Peters even admitted : \u201c And at times , he \u2019 s made it hard to argue with that.\n\u201d ( italics mine . )\nHe has indeed !\nAnd yet Peters proceeded to double down on the argument he previously made in April , that Musk has \u201c long made his politics tricky to pin down.\n\u201d Musk has \u2013 as you know , as everyone knows \u2013 been relentlessly hawking right-wing tropes and candidates , replatforming bigots , and spewing hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since he bought and started to demolish Twitter .\nHe is not hard to read .\nConsider , for instance , this reality-based assessment by Talking Points Memo \u2019 s Josh Marshall : That \u2019 s the Musk we all know .\nThat Jeremy Peters imagines Musk some other way wouldn \u2019 t be a problem if he weren \u2019 t operating in a very important newsroom where no one is brave enough or allowed close enough to power to call out people like him for being just plain wrong .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go against the liberal consensus zip through editing , while anything that sounds too liberal is suspect .\nThe words \u201c It \u2019 s not so simple , \u201d from Peters \u2019 s headline , is Timesian doctrine \u2014 even as the rise of Trump and white Christian totalitarianism have made many formerly complex social and political issues considerably more cut and dried .\nAnd like everyone else in the news business , the Times has become addicted to getting attention on social media .\nReliably restating and exploring obvious truths may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loyal audience \u2013 but it doesn \u2019 t get nearly as much attention as a hot , contrarian take , either on social media or with the top brass .\nNobody has been better at pointing out the ridiculous contortions the Times engages in to get attention ( while sticking to approved narratives and both-sidesing ) than the parody Twitter account known as the NYT Pitchbot .\nBut with Peters \u2019 s Musk story , as one Twitter wag put it : \u201c The New York Times/ New York Times Pitchbot singularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twitter reaction to the Musk story \u2013 it was a punchline for much of Saturday and Sunday \u2014 is a reminder of the platform \u2019 s continued centrality to media criticism .\nSee , for instance , the marvelous tweets from Aaron Rupar , Greg Gonsalves , Sherrilyn Ifill , Tom Scocca , Ron Brownstein , Elad Nehorai , and Adam Johnson .\nSome New York Times articles about outrageous things the right-wing is doing are obviously written with the expectation that the readers will understand how outrageous those things are , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own outrage .\nFor example , see today \u2019 s article by Elizabeth A. Harris and Alexandra Alter about book-banning .\nI have no doubt the authors are outraged \u2014 that \u2019 s why they chose to write about it .\nBut their emotionless stenography actually normalized this assault on tolerance and freedom .\nPeters \u2019 s Musk story , by contrast , was not like that .\nIt did not assume that readers would fill in the blanks because they are smart .\nIt was trying to prove that the readers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart one .\nBut when you do that , and you \u2019 re wrong , that \u2019 s called gaslighting .\n( Which reminds me of the time several months ago when Annie Karni wrote that Republicans \u201c have been intent on rehabilitating themselves in the eyes of voters after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol last year.\n\u201d ) It didn \u2019 t take long for Musk to provide yet more undeniable evidence of just how ludicrous Peters \u2019 s story was .\nOn Sunday , Musk tweeted \u201c My pronouns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Atlantic : Jeremy Peters is a serial offender of common sense and core journalistic values .\nHe is a frequent target here on Press Watch because so much of what he writes is deceptive .\nAnd every time , that deception favors the right .\nI wrote about him at length in November 2021 , when he was covering the Virginia gubernatorial election .\nHe didn \u2019 t just accept the lies and dog-whistles that now-Va. Gov .\nGlenn Youngkin used to get elected , he amplified them .\nMost notably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hillary-Biden voter \u201d who Peters wrote had recently reached a \u201c tipping point \u201d that led him to attend a Youngkin rally was , in fact , a prolific Republican donor and active foe of the ( nonexistent ) teaching of \u201c critical race theory \u201d in public schools .\nPeters had , somewhat famously , done something very similar in 2018 \u2014 although , in an interview , he blamed a \u201c handful of Democratic activists and liberal journalists \u201d who \u201c pushed out \u201d the \u201c major misconception \u201d that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c What comes through in Peters \u2019 stories , time and again , is that he has arrived at his answers before setting out to report , \u201d Substacker Jonathan M.

perfect for spoon-feeding a political media that gets easily distracted .\nNothing came out that didn \u2019 t fit each hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will inevitably be plenty of loose ends in the supporting material \u2014 many of which , when pulled on , could further the public \u2019 s understanding of what happened and who was responsible .\nIf , as promised , the supporting material is voluminous , unabridged , and exhaustive , it \u2019 s going to take more than the depleted Christmas-week Washington press corps to sort through it all .\nIn the right ( admittedly rare ) circumstances , crowdsourcing a document dump can be hugely valuable .\nThis would seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talking Points Memo famously enlisted its readers to help them flesh out a burgeoning scandal related to the politically-motivated firing of U.S .\nAttorneys in 2007 .\nAt one point , they had readers pore through 3,000 emails released by the Department of Justice .\nThe Guardian has used crowdsourcing to good effect , most notably in 2009 , when readers hunted through 700,000 individual documents comprising four years worth of expenses and claims filed by Members of Parliament .\nThe Guardian interface \u2013 allowing readers to tag their findings as \u201c interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c interesting but known , \u201d and \u201c investigate this !\n\u201d \u2014made categorization easy and fun .\nHow To Do It Unfortunately , precisely how the public can participate isn \u2019 t clear yet .\nWe don \u2019 t know how the committee plans to release the material .\nWill it be in PDFs ?\nIn raw text ?\nWill it be searchable ?\nThe Guardian hosted its own microsite with all the MP data .\nSo : Will any news organization or website import the 1/6 material and allow readers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe default move would be to annotate the original documents \u2013 something that a marvelous , open-source , non-profit annotation software called Hypothesis ( hypothes.is ) makes possible .\n( It \u2019 s basically a conversation layer over the entire web , a feature that was supposed to be part of the original web browser in 1993 but didn \u2019 t make it ) .\nI would encourage you to sign up for Hypothesis and install the extension ( or add a bookmarklet ) to your desktop browser .\nThen start trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share on social media .\nMake sure you @ me ( at Twitter , Mastodon and/or Post . )\nLet me know how it goes , in comments or by email at froomkin @ presswatchers.org .\nNews coverage of the investigation into the January 6 insurrection has been surprisingly adequate ( with the exception of the near silence about the role of racism and politics in why law enforcement agencies failed to sufficiently mobilize against a known threat . )\nSo to review , you could do worse than consult coverage from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post .\nBut to get a thorough grounding in what we know and what we don \u2019 t know , the insufficiently-heralded Just Security website has compiled some extraordinary resources , most notably the Citizens Guide to January 6th and Ongoing Threats to Democracy and a Criminal Evidence Tracker .\nI have frequently complained about the committee hoarding information , and I \u2019 m still a little worried that they \u2019 ll pull back at the last minute .\nCommittee members are on the record saying they \u2019 ll release everything , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only way to fully insulate themselves against a bogus planned investigation-of-the-investigation by the majority House Republicans come next year .\nCommittee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren , for instance , once again promised to deliver everything on Tuesday , in conversation with MSNBC \u2019 s Chris Hayes .\nLOFGREN : We ` ve said before , it is our intention to release the committee records in their entirety .\nAnd when we do , I think the press is going to have a very busy time looking at all the information .\nI mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the evidence in the report , and certainly was impossible to put it all in our hearings .\nBut we are going to put all the committee records out and I think it will be of tremendous interest not only the public but I ` m sure to the press .\nHAYES : That was actually going to be my second question about the sort of allowing a kind of open-source reporters to go through everything from transcripts of depositions , other items have been subpoenaed , so I guess our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , belongs to the American people since the committee was constituted by it , will be in the public domain at some point .\nLOFGREN : Right .\nThere ` s a couple \u2014 not exceptions , but the Secret Service gave us like a million documents .\nThey didn ` t give it to us , they lent it to us so we could go through of it .\nIt really belongs to them and they ` re going to take it back .\nBut there were some nuggets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasn ` t that relevant .\nThere ` s some nuggets that we hope to produce .\nObviously , we need to \u2014 if they ` re a law enforcement sensitive issues there , we need to at least talk to the Secret Service about that .\nWe ` re going to redact like , people ` s personal cell phones and email addresses .\nWe don ` t want to open people up to harassment .\nAnd there were two very low level individuals who were mere witnesses that we said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect their identity for their personal safety .\nBut everything else , I think , all the committee records will be out there and I think it ` ll be interesting .\nHAYES : Are you prepared and your staff members prepared for a counter investigation for the House majority , their incoming Republican House Majority to attempt to use its official power to essentially debunk or discredit the report .\nLOFGREN : Well , I mean , Kevin McCarthy has more or less indicated that .\nAnd that ` s another reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthwhile .\nIf the entire committee record is in the public domain , you can ` t selectively edit it and then spin it .\nIt ` ll be all out there .\nAnd people will be able to see that we worked hard , and we did I believe an honorable job in presenting the facts that we found .\nKyle Cheney and Nicholas Wu reported for Politico on Monday that the evidence includes \u201c more than 1,000 witness interviews , extensive call records obtained via subpoenas to phone companies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided .\nThe committee also obtained extensive Trump White House records from the National Archives that gave contemporaneous details of Trump \u2019 s efforts within the West Wing.\n\u201d But , they wrote , the committee has not yet formally decided precisely how much to publicly release and might , for instance , not release hundreds of hours of video depositions .\nThat will all presumably be decided on Monday , at the committee \u2019 s final business meeting .\nAnyone who cares about transparency , accountability , and the public \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand full access to everything \u2013 and then use it .", "author": "Dan Froomkin", "url":

Times newsroom have rarely been laid out as clearly as they were on Saturday , when it published an article by Jeremy Peters headlined \u201c Critics Say Musk Has Revealed Himself as a Conservative .\nIt \u2019 s Not So Simple.\n\u201d And it wasn \u2019 t just Peters adopting this ridiculous argument .\nHis editor , and their editor , and a whole slew of other editors either actively approved of the article or chose not to say anything and let it get published .\nHow , you might well ask , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrated newsroom bring forth something so laughably , ludicrously wrong ?\n\u2022 By valuing unflappability over sounding the alarm .\n\u2022 By valuing trolling the libs over sounding like one .\n\u2022 By valuing \u201c balance \u201d even where there is none .\nIn short , by valuing reporters like Jeremy Peters .\nIn the article , Peters himself acknowledged that \u201c to many of his critics , \u201d Musk \u2019 s \u201c relentless flurry of tweets in the six weeks since he took over Twitter has exposed his true conservative bent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the social network more susceptible to right-wing misinformation.\n\u201d Peters even admitted : \u201c And at times , he \u2019 s made it hard to argue with that.\n\u201d ( italics mine . )\nHe has indeed !\nAnd yet Peters proceeded to double down on the argument he previously made in April , that Musk has \u201c long made his politics tricky to pin down.\n\u201d Musk has \u2013 as you know , as everyone knows \u2013 been relentlessly hawking right-wing tropes and candidates , replatforming bigots , and spewing hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since he bought and started to demolish Twitter .\nHe is not hard to read .\nConsider , for instance , this reality-based assessment by Talking Points Memo \u2019 s Josh Marshall : That \u2019 s the Musk we all know .\nThat Jeremy Peters imagines Musk some other way wouldn \u2019 t be a problem if he weren \u2019 t operating in a very important newsroom where no one is brave enough or allowed close enough to power to call out people like him for being just plain wrong .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go against the liberal consensus zip through editing , while anything that sounds too liberal is suspect .\nThe words \u201c It \u2019 s not so simple , \u201d from Peters \u2019 s headline , is Timesian doctrine \u2014 even as the rise of Trump and white Christian totalitarianism have made many formerly complex social and political issues considerably more cut and dried .\nAnd like everyone else in the news business , the Times has become addicted to getting attention on social media .\nReliably restating and exploring obvious truths may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loyal audience \u2013 but it doesn \u2019 t get nearly as much attention as a hot , contrarian take , either on social media or with the top brass .\nNobody has been better at pointing out the ridiculous contortions the Times engages in to get attention ( while sticking to approved narratives and both-sidesing ) than the parody Twitter account known as the NYT Pitchbot .\nBut with Peters \u2019 s Musk story , as one Twitter wag put it : \u201c The New York Times/ New York Times Pitchbot singularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twitter reaction to the Musk story \u2013 it was a punchline for much of Saturday and Sunday \u2014 is a reminder of the platform \u2019 s continued centrality to media criticism .\nSee , for instance , the marvelous tweets from Aaron Rupar , Greg Gonsalves , Sherrilyn Ifill , Tom Scocca , Ron Brownstein , Elad Nehorai , and Adam Johnson .\nSome New York Times articles about outrageous things the right-wing is doing are obviously written with the expectation that the readers will understand how outrageous those things are , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own outrage .\nFor example , see today \u2019 s article by Elizabeth A. Harris and Alexandra Alter about book-banning .\nI have no doubt the authors are outraged \u2014 that \u2019 s why they chose to write about it .\nBut their emotionless stenography actually normalized this assault on tolerance and freedom .\nPeters \u2019 s Musk story , by contrast , was not like that .\nIt did not assume that readers would fill in the blanks because they are smart .\nIt was trying to prove that the readers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart one .\nBut when you do that , and you \u2019 re wrong , that \u2019 s called gaslighting .\n( Which reminds me of the time several months ago when Annie Karni wrote that Republicans \u201c have been intent on rehabilitating themselves in the eyes of voters after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol last year.\n\u201d ) It didn \u2019 t take long for Musk to provide yet more undeniable evidence of just how ludicrous Peters \u2019 s story was .\nOn Sunday , Musk tweeted \u201c My pronouns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Atlantic : Jeremy Peters is a serial offender of common sense and core journalistic values .\nHe is a frequent target here on Press Watch because so much of what he writes is deceptive .\nAnd every time , that deception favors the right .\nI wrote about him at length in November 2021 , when he was covering the Virginia gubernatorial election .\nHe didn \u2019 t just accept the lies and dog-whistles that now-Va. Gov .\nGlenn Youngkin used to get elected , he amplified them .\nMost notably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hillary-Biden voter \u201d who Peters wrote had recently reached a \u201c tipping point \u201d that led him to attend a Youngkin rally was , in fact , a prolific Republican donor and active foe of the ( nonexistent ) teaching of \u201c critical race theory \u201d in public schools .\nPeters had , somewhat famously , done something very similar in 2018 \u2014 although , in an interview , he blamed a \u201c handful of Democratic activists and liberal journalists \u201d who \u201c pushed out \u201d the \u201c major misconception \u201d that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c What comes through in Peters \u2019 stories , time and again , is that he has arrived at his answers before setting out to report , \u201d Substacker Jonathan M. Katz concluded .\nAnd as an observer on Twitter noted , \u201c that always seems to work to white nationalists \u2019 benefit.\n\u201d Again , similarly , Peters was the lead author of an article in 2017 , after Nazis rallied in Charlottesville , in which he identified a woman named Michelle Piercy as \u201c a night shift worker at a Wichita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove all night with a conservative group that opposed the planned removal of a statue of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee.\n\u201d Piercy was actually affiliated with a right-wing militia group called the American Warrior Revolution that marched through the streets of Charlottesville , armed and dressed in military-style clothing .\nMy Twitter timeline is full of Peters foibles , including the time he wrote that the death of Herman Cain from Covid in July 2020 \u201c has made Republicans and President Trump face the reality of the pandemic as it hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah right .\nPeters was ceremoniously taken off the national desk and given a plum assignment covering the media and culture in April , and has continued to produce takes that damage democracy .\nHe has repeatedly demonstrated willful ignorance about Fox News , which any responsible journalist should recognize as a singular disease vector that traffics in propaganda and misinformation .\nBut by Peters \u2019 s account , Fox is just \u201c sparing conservative viewers what they don \u2019 t want to hear , \u201d and is a place where \u201c misinformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c insider \u201d wrote in a book that the network \u2019 s rightist tilt is less about ideology and more about making money , Peters seemed surprised , calling it \u201c a counterintuitive take.\n\u201d His intuition is evidently not so good .\nHe is a fabulist and a dupe , always for the right , and the fact that he is thriving\u2013 that he can publish an article like the one about Musk without consequences \u2014 is as serious an indictment of the New York Times newsroom as I can imagine .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Times on Press Watch .\nPlease see my article for The Nation : The New York Times Has Badly Lost Its Bearings .\nAnd please consider that the New York Times will never hire another public editor and your generous ( tax deductible ) donations are what keeps me going .", "author": "Dan Froomkin", "url": "https://presswatchers.org/2022/12/just-like-elon-musk-the-new-york-times-cant-stop-trolling-the-libs/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=just-like-elon-musk-the-new-york-times-cant-stop-trolling-the-libs", "published": "Mon, 12 Dec 2022 22:15:40 +0000", "published_utc": 1670901340, "collection_utc": 1675294852}]
