is Preparing the World for the Antichrist-Michael Youssef Claims.", "content": "( CP ) Bestselling author and cultural anthropologist Michael Youssef distances himself from being misunderstood by the congregation .\nHe begins by saying that he is not an end-time preacher when he was interviewed .\nThe 73- year old preacher is an Egyptian-American national .\nYoussef refers to his new book , Is the End Near ?\n, which tells Christians Jesus \u2019 teachings about the Biblical end times .\nThe book is derived from Matthew \u2019 s Gospel and highlights what many have already noted .\nThe increase in demonic content in popular culture and an increase in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s book focuses on six signs mentioned by Jesus in Matthew 24 and 25 , including the Roman army \u2019 s destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD and the time before Jesus \u2019 return .\nHe analyzes his assertions further and says that popular shows such as Lucifer and Little Demons highlight common ideas and humanization of the Biblical antichrist figure as per the book of revelation .\nHe goes further to enlighten by saying that the Disney-owned animated series Little Demon portrays a woman impregnated by Satan and giving birth to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film plays on nudity , violence , and witchcraft .\nYoussef described such programming content as an example of how secular media plays a role in truth-telling indoctrination .\nHe says that the media is also playing a role in promoting content that will keep the antichrist thing on a hot stove , and he compares it to the COVID-19 vaccine preparation so that when the antichrist comes , we are ready .\nAccording to Michael , pastors have issued warnings , and groups such as One Million Moms have condemned the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dangers of the demonic realm .\nHe says that the rising authoritarian regimes in Western democracies are indicators that Satan is preparing the world for the antichrist .\nHe acknowledges that earthquakes , famines , and storms have always occurred but claims that they are coming faster and faster .\nHe checks with Jesus \u2019 teachings and says he became convinced that Jesus talked about , the days before the return of the Son of Man , are the days we \u2019 re living .\n\u201d Michael claims that one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great falling away from the faith .\nHe mentioned this according to Matthew 24:10 \u2014 a trend Yousseff believes is currently underway .\nYouseff cited a study from last October that found up to 70 % of evangelicals believe there are many paths to God .\nHe says they no longer focus on God \u2019 s faithfulness and His Son , as Jesus stated in John 14:6 .\nYoussef claims that thousands of Muslims are coming to Christ in the Arabic world .\nHis Arabic TV station , The Kingdom SAT , reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That tells me the Lord is gathering His elect , \u201d Youssef said .\n\u201c He is gathering his faithful ones in preparation for his return.\n\u201d Youseff hopes that the book will inspire pastors and other church leaders .\nHe also hopes it will prepare their congregations for difficult times ahead .\nWe need to teach people how to be faithful in the face of adversity , \u201c he said .\nWe must resist , but we must prepare for the onslaught .", "author": "Dickens O", "url":
