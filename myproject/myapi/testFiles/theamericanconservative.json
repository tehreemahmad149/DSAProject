Holmes recently expressed discomfort that a vocal minority of American conservatives have decided to abandon classical liberalism in favor of \u201c common good \u201d politics\u2014he considers this movement both an intrinsic danger ( talk of the \u201c common good \u201d is vague and prone to abuse by tyrants ) and a departure from the philosophy of the Founding Fathers .\nMr. Holmes \u2019 s interlocutors , such as Josh Hammer , rightly took issue with his characterizations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal as one might be led to believe .\nIt is important , however , to ask a more fundamental question : why do we care what the Founders thought ?\nNow , I do not mean this as sarcastically as it sounds .\nWe do care what the Founders thought ; the question is why , or in what respect .\nOriginalists , among whom Mr. Holmes numbers himself , answer that the original public meaning of the Constitution should govern its interpretation today\u2014the law means today what it was understood to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThus quotations such as those proffered above by our Twitter acquaintance\u2014and not only those , but also newspaper articles , pamphlets , public speeches , legal commentaries\u2014are in a certain way dispositive .\nTogether they possess great authority , not merely historical interest .\nLet us take the example of the natural law .\nMr. Holmes criticizes certain conservatives ( Adrian Vermeule , e.g . )\nfor wanting to apply natural law to legal interpretation in a way foreign to the minds of the Founders .\nThey , he writes , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But theirs was a particular interpretation born in the Anglo-Scottish Enlightenment\u2026 .\nThey certainly did not use Aquinas as a model.\n\u201d Suppose we concede that arguendo : where does that leave us ?\nWhat relationship should the Founders \u2019 conception of the natural law have with our own natural-law philosophy ?\nThis is indeed the crux of the disagreement .\nMr. Holmes , as an originalist , believes that our legal interpretation must take into account natural law because it was integral to general understanding in 1789 .\nIf , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of a Constitutional provision or a statute , we must pay attention to the way Americans of the founding generation thought about natural law .\nThe implicit corollary is that if the founding generation did not care about natural law , then we should not make natural law part of our legal interpretation , since that would be to falsify the original public meaning of the provisions we wish to interpret .\nI , however , do not take notice of natural law simply because James Wilson did ; I take notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is real .\nI think that it is written into nature and discoverable by human reason , that it exists quite independently of either the Founders or ourselves .\nOur first question in politics must be , \u201c What is true ?\n\u201d rather than \u201c What was the popular view in 1789 ?\n\u201d Our argument , then , should be whether the Founders were correct about the contents and application of natural law ; it is natural law itself , not the Founders \u2019 beliefs , that binds us .\nIndeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Founders did not believe in it .\nOur political philosophy must proceed first from objective reality , not from the subjective persuasions of a certain age .\nLaw , if it is to be real law , is an embodiment of reason , not merely an action of inscrutable will .\nWhen we consider the American political patrimony , we must consider universal truth in addition to , and even before , historical particularity .\nAre we then to have no respect for the historical character of peoples and regimes ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , a great conservative principle .\nIt is founded on the idea of determination : natural law is general and does not dictate the minute practical details of politics , so it can be instantiated in many different justifiable ways by different positive laws and local customs .\nWe therefore respect the American political tradition insofar as it instantiates and coheres with universal principles , and no further .\nWe honor our heritage , as we ought , but not at the expense of truth .\nThus when someone tells us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d as our aforementioned Twitter friend attempted to do , we must inquire further : is the objection that we have our own legitimate custom and ought not needlessly import a foreign one , or is it that American history sets the limits of what is true and good ?\nThe former we concede ; the latter we deny .\nConservatives ought to be principally interested in truth .\nThe American right would make a much better case if it argued for the truth of the Founders \u2019 beliefs , not merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOtherwise its stance is nothing more than cultural relativism\u2014nihilism wrapped in the flag .\nLiam Warner \u2018 s writing has appeared in National Review and the Wall Street Journal .", "author": "Liam Warner", "url": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/truth-and-the-american-tradition/", "published": "Sat, 01 Jan 2022 05:01:44 +0000", "published_utc": 1641031304, "collection_utc": 1641039064}, {"id": "theamericanconservative--2022-01-03--Eric Adams Takes the Reins in New York", "date": "2022-01-03", "source": "theamericanconservative", "title": "Eric Adams Takes the Reins in New York", "content": "NEW YORK , NEW YORK - JANUARY 01 : Eric Adams is sworn in as the 110th mayor of the city of New York on January 01 , 2022 in New York , NY .\nDue to a surge in COVID-19 cases , the official inauguration has been postponed , and Adams chose to be sworn into office in Times Square following the annual New Years Eve ball drop .\n( Photo by Arturo Holmes/Getty Images ) It was , perhaps only in retrospect , a seminal moment .\nEight years ago this week , Bill de Blasio was ushered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed left-winger , an actual ex-Sandinista , the man born Warren Wilhelm , Jr. , was a man seemingly out of the fever dream of a commenter on TownHall.com , that Tea Party throwback\u2026the Democrats were , indeed , communists in all but name .\nThat de Blasio had stunningly cleared the Democratic field\u2014after the collapse of the political career of Anthony Weiner and the wet noodle campaign of Christine Quinn , then-speaker of the New York City Council\u2014contributed to an atmosphere of dramatic , left-wing populist ascension .\nI would be soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rise of Syriza in Greece and the success of Bernie Sanders in the States ( the matching right-wing populist flavor was not yet as clear , but would soon be demonstrated by the rise of India \u2019 s Narendra Modi , Brexit , and the election you-know-who ) .\nMichael Anton reminded us last week , in a fabulous dispatch on the decline of American cities for First Things , of the sentiment among skeptics back then when de Blasio got in .\n\u201c I predicted imminent mayhem .\nThat turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , \u201c one could sense subtle changes almost instantly .\nThe police pulled back\u2014either under orders , or intuiting that active enforcement would no longer be backed by City Hall .\nOrder was upheld less , anti-social types took more liberties on the streets , and one began to anticipate , on the subways , that , sooner or later , \u2018 you were gon na have a problem .

both demographics have been the victims of clearly targeted racial attacks in the city in recent years .\nAnd some veterans of the city \u2019 s last real crime wars , the 1990s , remember the younger Adams , who is black , as something of a \u201c race hustler.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last black mayor , David Dinkins , was arguably sunk by mishandling such sensitive matters , most famously the Crown Heights riots .\nWhen Adams was backing Dinkins in the 1993 race , race didn \u2019 t exactly not seem to top of mind for the young progressive police officer , and he made comments foreshadowing the comeback of anti-miscegenation sentiments in the body politic , this time from the left .\nAdams attacked the running mate of future New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani on ghastly grounds .\n\u201c Mr .\nAdams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were truly concerned about the Hispanic community , he would have married a Hispanic woman , \u201d the New York Times reported at the time .\n\u201c Mr .\nBadillo is Puerto Rican and his wife is Jewish.\n\u201d But time has done its thing and quite notably none of that kind of nonsense was on display from Mr. Adams \u2019 campaign for mayor .\nAdams is still clearly kind of wacky : from his weird , random flair for a lot of foreign travel ( he was in Ghana last year even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to dubiously residing in New Jersey , to seemingly really liking Republicans these days , despite not being one ( he dined with billionaire kingpin John Castimadis and Fox News \u2019 s Bo Dietl right after his summer primary triumph ) .\nBut Adams has hired a tough-minded cat \u2019 s paw , the veteran New York fixer Frank Carrone , as his chief of staff , in a first sign of seriousness .\nIt \u2019 s an insider-y pick , sure , but it appears to be an improvement on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinkins employed to get things done , or not .\nThis cadre included famed inside man Bill Lynch , who went way back with Dinkins , including in his preceding post as Manhattan bureau president .\nCarrone is a Brooklynite like Adams , and he is likewise an ex-bureau president .\nBut in an identity-obsessed Democratic Party , if not America , Carrone as the top gun will subtly dispel early anxieties about Adams as a potential factional black mayor .\nAfrican Americans are certainly Adams \u2019 political base , so governing coldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but hardly irrational .\nBut Adams \u2019 clear black identity is this strange , double-edged sword for the Democratic establishment .\nBluntly , it has given Adams an unspoken , Nixon-goes-to-China ability to get tough on crime in the early going .\nThis is not exactly unprecedented elsewhere , of course : witness the African American mayor of San Francisco , London Breed , cracking down in the benighted Tenderloin District .\nStrikingly , the loudest opponents of a course correction in the USA\u2014from S.F.\n\u2019 s Chesa Boudin to Philly \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form : Krasner has inspired criticism in recent days from ex-mayor Michael Nutter , an African American .\nThese racial dynamics are uncomfortable , but unfortunately undeniable .\nTAC founding editor Scott McConnell noted in a recent piece that it was often writers and politicians from then- \u201d ethnic \u201d backgrounds\u2014often working class Jews and Italians\u2014that formed the basis of the first neoconservative wave that saved America \u2019 s cities ( the second wave was far less successful in the second Iraq War ) .\nPerhaps something is at hand again in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and African Americans views on crime and even \u201c Black Lives Matter \u201d vs. \u201c All Lives Matter \u201d are hardly a monolith , to the dismay of , yes , often-white liberal media elites .\nIf Adams is one of persuasion , his vanquished Republican opponent , longtime vigilante crime fighter Curtis Silwa ( head of a sort of subway \u201c League of Shadows \u201d ) is the exaggerated version of that tendency .\nZeitgeists happen .\nWitness presidential politics .\nBush v.

relief will change nothing in the underlying factors driving students into debt .\nSomething has to change the calculus between wages , tuition costs , and declining state funding .\nOne solution would be to tie federal funding to a state \u2019 s willingness to lower public tuition to match a reasonable work expectation from a full-time student .\nSo tuition would go up or down based on what someone could earn at minimum wage with , say , 15 hours of after-school work a week .\nIt would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way through school .\nThere \u2019 s also another way , sadly far beyond the intellectual reach of a once-great nation like the United States .\nThe United States , still struggling to transition from a soot-and-steel base to something that can compete in the 21st century , can only do so through education .\nMore smart people is an investment in one of the most critical forms of infrastructure out there\u2014brains .\nA single F-35 fighter plane costs $ 178 million .\nDropping just

Whose Relativism?", "content": "Conservative discourse in America has set its sights on the extremes of a \u201c woke \u201d progressivism preached by the liberal establishment in politics , big business , and the media .\nPages of conservative publications and think tanks are littered with censure of critical race theory , gender ideology , LGBTQ ideology , etc .\nThis is as it should be .\nYet many of these criticisms fall into the same traps as the very thing they criticize .\nAn ideological and moral relativism lies at the heart of both sides of this discourse : a shrill insistence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or be whatever he or she ( or whatever other pronoun ) wishes to think or be .\nThe sides merely disagree about whose relativism should be protected by the structures of political power .\nIn contrast , we can remember a conservatism that would assert , simply and confidently , that \u201c there exists an enduring moral order , \u201d one that is not simply relative to the subjective whims and preferences of the individual ; that the truth is not simply what you individually decide it to be ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this enduring and objective moral order .\nBen Shapiro \u2019 s notorious quip that \u201c facts don \u2019 t care about your feelings \u201d might be considered a faint echo of this older moral realism that used to be the hallmark of conservatism .\nYet the capitulation of many conservatives ( including Shapiro himself ) to a libertarian individualism that renounces the role of government in publicly committing to a particular vision of the common good undermines this commitment to moral realism , in practice relativizing even the claim that moral truth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral truth is absolute , but you may choose to believe whatever you wish to believe .\nIt is not uncommon to hear conservatives ( on talk radio for instance ) condemning the \u201c indoctrination \u201d of Americans by the left as a direct attack on their constitutional right to freedom of thought and freedom of speech .\nWhy can \u2019 t they just leave us alone and let us think what we want to think ?\nConservatism , by this account , is about getting along with\u2014or simply being left alone by\u2014people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t this the purpose of the First Amendment ?\nIsn \u2019 t this the noble vision described in the founding documents ?\nIt is important to keep in mind , however , that the liberal proponents of progressive ideology also view themselves as proponents of free thought and free expression .\nThat is , after all , the core of progressivism \u2019 s main tenets .\n\u201c Diversity , equity , and inclusion \u201d are the doctrinal expression of the left \u2019 s brand of identity politics , which professes the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity , to express himself authentically by a pure act of will .\nIf I can not simply choose my gender , and claim all the rights proper to my chosen identity , then am I really free ?\nIf the constraints of the patriarchal family structure , or Christian morality , or traditional gender norms , etc.\n, prevent me from choosing my identity , then am I really free ?\nThe left \u2019 s agenda to enforce woke doctrine is really nothing other than its own attempt to preserve that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sovereign individual .\nBoth the libertarian conservative and the progressive liberal see themselves as victims of an oppressive and dogmatic ideological structure : the conservative sees himself as oppressed by the ideological structures of the left , its political parties , the media , university administrations , corporate leadership , etc .\n; the progressive sees himself as oppressed by the very structures and traditions which , allegedly , the conservative wishes to conserve .\nBoth protest that they are entitled to think whatever they please , be whomever they please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be left alone by those who would tell them otherwise .\nFor the conservative , freedom of thought is a right protected by the original American Constitution\u2014though not by much more than that , as the Constitution alone proves to be increasingly insufficient against the ongoing capture of America \u2019 s institutions by progressive ideology .\nFor the progressive , the freedom to choose one \u2019 s own identity must be protected by standards of \u201c diversity , equity , and inclusion \u201d that are incorporated into evolving constitutional structures , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the leadership of America \u2019 s corporations , and so forth , in order to protect the individual from oppressive structures ( e.g.\n, the traditional family , traditional religion , etc . )\nthat would put limits on that freedom .\nYet both sides are intent on holding the other accountable to their own version of relativism , and they see their opponents as authoritarian oppressors or dogmatic fundamentalists .\nLibertarian conservatism overlooks the fact that moral realism has practical consequences in the public sphere .\nMoral realism requires a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thought or freedom of identity , but to the public recognition and enforcement of moral truth and the common good .\nIt is not consistent to be a realist in theory but a relativist in practice .\nIf the truth really is absolute , then it follows that you may not simply choose to believe whatever you wish to believe , or be whomever you wish to be .\nIf the truth is truly independent of an individual \u2019 s feelings or choices , then it requires a public authority to defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public authority to defend and enforce the truth\u2014yes , even to legislate morality\u2014then in practice , no matter how much one might assert the contrary , the truth has been relativized .\nThis is what both the libertarian and the liberal desire : a world where each person may choose \u201c his truth , \u201d where no morality is publicly enforced except the right to choose one \u2019 s own truth .\nThe impulse to criticize woke or progressive ideology on the basis of an imaginary right to freedom of expression undermines the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tradition .\nConservatism thus becomes no more than a mask for an alternate form of liberal relativism .\nIt is notable that this mask drops when the same reasoning about free speech is deployed by some self-styled conservatives , such as David French , in defense of woke ideology , or at least in defense of the freedom of its proponents to propagate it .\nIt should be clear that this essentially libertarian approach , even if it goes by the name of \u201c constitutional conservatism , \u201d is a misguided response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not simply because it is powerless to ward off progressivism \u2019 s assaults , but more importantly because it is essentially the same thing on an ideological level .\nJonathan Culbreath is an independent writer and researcher living in Southern California

reason to oppose vaccine passports .\nThe most important reason is that once you create the infrastructure for a social credit system , you will never get rid of it .\nOnce Americans get accustomed to scanning a QR code every time they enter a building , there is no limit to the surveillance and nudges that can be built on top of it .\nThere would be a record of where you went and who you were with

code check-ins in criminal investigations .\nThis suggests they get some level of surveillance out of it beyond what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone location tracking and other digital footprints .\nIt would be very easy for apps like CLEAR Health Pass to build social credit systems on top of vaccine passports , rewarding certain behaviors and penalizing others\u2014all the more so because they are private

s what will happen when every storefront is plugged into the CLEAR or VaxYes ecosystem .\nThe tech sector has its own reasons for salivating at the prospect of a vaccine passport .\nData is the new gold , as the saying goes .\nVaccine passes offer an unprecedented opportunity to collect data and , more importantly , to sync up a person \u2019 s data under a single digital profile .\nIn his

this system in place before the crisis atmosphere of Covid evaporates .\nWe have an equally narrow window for preventing it .\nVaccine passports were first trialed in San Francisco and New York City .\nThe fact that they went into effect relatively smoothly , without provoking a revolution in either city , is the number one factor emboldening other mayors to adopt them .\nThe only thing that will stop vaccine passports from spreading further is if the system stops working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay away , if music and sports ticket sales decline , if businesses refuse to enforce this discriminatory system until legal challenges are heard .\nMy husband suggests that residents of Washington , D.C. , should protest the vaccine passport when it comes into effect on January 15 by taking our

that recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who walked into an indoor dining venue , he backed down after popular outcry .\nDigital vaccine passport apps are a much bigger threat to personal privacy .\nThere needs to be that kind of outcry again .\nIt will be no consolation if vaccine passports are only implemented in a few blue cities .\nThe Soviet Union \u2019 s internal passport system was confined to major

"source": "theamericanconservative", "title": "A Light in the Darkness", "content": "Younger readers can be forgiven for being unfamiliar with Dennis Kucinich .\nWhen he ran as a presidential candidate in the 2004 election , he put up a platform that was regarded as utterly ridiculous : not only legalizing same-sex marriage but also pulling out of Iraq , instituting universal single-payer health care , withdrawing from NAFTA and the WTO , and implementing tuition-free college .\nToday , almost all of those once-fringe positions are mainstream within the Democratic Party .\nYet Kucinich , rather than being treated as a far-sighted party elder , remains relegated to the margins .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ is intimately familiar with the sort of corrupt politicking and counterfeit capitalism that dominates contemporary American politics .\nNot only that , but he is one of the few successful living crusaders against it , making him a threat to not just the Democratic Party establishment but also the American elite class in general .\nHow this came to be is told in Division of Light and Power , a sprawling yet readable account of his ten-year battle against the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company , which sought to squash the city \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Muny Light \u201d for short , between 1969 and 1979 in an effort to acquire a monopoly over the region \u2019 s electrical grid .\nAs a 23-year-old , still-in-college , recently elected city councilman , Kucinich found himself caught in a power blackout in the middle of downtown Cleveland .\nSeeking to understand why , Kucinich learned that the regional for-profit power company was engaged in a campaign to systematically sabotage and eventually forcefully acquire the city \u2019 s public energy utility .\nThe latter had obvious benefits to the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn \u2019 t pay dividends or large salaries to executive officers , and it offered electricity rates 20 percent cheaper than CEI \u2019 s .\nCEI \u2019 s strategy was rather ingenious .\nThe company persuaded the city council not to make necessary repairs to Muny \u2019 s generators .\nWhen blackouts happened , Muny had to buy emergency power from CEI at above-retail rates , causing Muny to lose money .\nWith its finances weakened and its systems going unrepaired , Muny came to be seen as a liability rather than an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong pitch that it would be better for the public for Muny to be sold .\nWith a firm power monopoly established , CEI would then be able to jack up prices and escape accountability .\nKucinich dives into the details as to how this was attempted , including how CEI convinced the city council to vote in its favor .\nThis included everything from free electrical appliances and season baseball tickets to pro bono legal representation .\nSuch favors were typical , Kucinich explains .\n\u201c Attorneys elected to Council get law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow councilman tells him .\n\u201c Insurance salesmen get policies .\nTravel agents book trips for people they help .\nReal estate guys get commissions from property deals called to their attention .\nIt \u2019 s all legit.\n\u201d Though the bookprimarily focuses on the war between CEI and Muny Light , it contains many examples of private business attempting to make money by colluding with public officials , from councilmen intervening with the building department to shortcut safety inspections for carnivals to the passing of massive tax abatements for large corporations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter .\n\u201c Buildings constructed on prime downtown real estate would be tax-free for fifteen years .\nThe burden of taxation in the Cleveland area was increasingly shifted to residential homeowners.\n\u201d One can not read Kucinich \u2019 s description of tax abatements without thinking of the tax incentives given to Amazon by both New York City and Virginia two years ago or the grab bag for large companies in the recently passed infrastructure bill .\nHow are Americans , and conservatives in particular , supposed to fight back against this sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that the existing political party establishments could not be relied upon .\nElected officials were beholden to businesses , even when their business practices hurt the local community .\nAfter he was elected mayor , Kucinich and his team found out that some of Cleveland \u2019 s largest banks collectively had around $ 2 billion in municipal bonds originating from outside the Cleveland area and had profits over $ 120 million in 1977 ( even after accounting for cash set aside for a rainy day ) but nonetheless refused to refinance a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , primarily because these same banks were heavily invested in CEI , shared directorships , and were backing CEI \u2019 s campaign to acquire Muny Light for financial reasons .\nWhen Kucinich publicly challenged the banks for moving capital outside of the city and red-lining city neighborhoods , \u201c The Chairman of the local Democratic Party accused me of attacking the free enterprise system , of pitting rich against poor , the haves against the have-nots and barred me from participating in major party events.\n\u201d Similarly , Kucinich realized that the media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrenched corporate interests such as CEI , which could use their mammoth influence via advertising dollars to silence critics .\nThe book names multiple journalists who were fired or \u201c resigned \u201d after reporting on CEI .\nIf party establishments and the press can not be relied upon in confronting entrenched corporate interests , what then ?\nKucinich overcame the dependence on corporate interests by engaging in traditional door-to-door campaigning combined with endless appearances at community events .\nHe would \u201c appear at public transportation hubs in the early morning , schedule group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then begin knocking on doors after lunch , seeking out individual voters \u2019 support , until darkness fell .\nWhenever I found an enthusiastic supporter , I \u2019 d ask them to join me as I campaigned.\n\u201d This is how politics used to work in the United States .\nIn his latest book , The New Class War : Saving Democracy from the Managerial Elite , scholar Michael Lind explains that key to amplifying the political power of the working class were traditional institutions such as trade unions , churches , religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c County people would talk to the state people , state people would send the message that things are going on out here .\nNow that the parties are just shells bought by billionaires , you don \u2019 t get that.\n\u201d Checking the unconstrained influence of contemporary corporate America will require the restoration of mass membership political parties as they existed for most of this country \u2019 s history .\nThis should be goal number one for conservatives , whether it be in the form of a new party or a well-organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A new political cadre of trained and organized party members , focused primarily on defending the interests of constituents at every level , will be essential .\nNear the end of his mayoral term , after much political fighting and wrangling , Kucinich moved to put the issue of Muny Light before Cleveland voters via a special election and delivered a crushing victory by a two-to-one margin .\nBy 1998 , it was estimated that Muny Light ( now Cleveland Public Power ) had saved the people of Cleveland around $ 300 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely more since then .\nThis victory was not free , though .\nThe members of Kucinich \u2019 s administration faced \u201c terrible personal and financial dilemmas , \u201d as Cleveland \u2019 s corporate establishment took vengeance upon those who dared to stand in their way .\nKucinich himself faced serious financial difficulty , reportedly only earning $ 38 in income in 1982 .\nForeshadowing the sort of \u201c cancel culture \u201d some Americans face today , Kucinich found himself \u201c blackballed \u201d in his own city in the early 1980s : No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who gave me a job .\nWhenever and wherever I sought employment after leaving office , offers were extended , then withdrawn .\nA radio station wanted to hire me .\nA key advertiser told station management it had better not .\nA newspaper column was offered , then retracted .\nA television station official called , expressed interest in guest editorials , then nothing .\nA local company wanted to pay me $ 10,000 to do a commercial .\nThe offer disappeared when one of their major customers , Republic Steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official who gave me a temporary , entry-level , part-time position as a course instructor was chastised by his superiors for not getting clearance from his Dean to hire me .\nAnyone who wishes to take a stand against the status quo of contemporary American politics will likely face similar punishment .\nPower will not be reclaimed from corporate and special interests without a fight .\nThe question is whether the painful endeavor is worth it .\nFor those who believe in public service , democratic values , and love of one \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will always be a hearty yes .\nCarlos Roa is senior editor of the National Interest .", "author": "Carlos Roa", "url":

years sound almost reasonable in 2022 .\nThey have an election to win , or , if not that , at least a red wave to fend off .\nConventional wisdom says primary season is all about tacking to the extremes as you build a coalition , with the wink and nudge to independents that you \u2019 ll move center for the general and govern as a moderate who throws bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no one but moderates and independents still to appeal to , with an unpopular incumbent president and a shaky-looking Congressional majority ; the extremes will take care of themselves .\nLiberals will take a victory as license to govern however they \u2019 d like , but they \u2019 ve got to get there first .\nSo we should expect them to say anything , have any sort of change of heart and late realization about what kind of hard decisions have to be made in our long road to post-pandemic recovery .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of the rhetoric , what does current Democratic governance look like in practice ?\nThere are plenty of blue cities to choose from .\nI might have picked Balti-less but feel that like the joke that would be too easy .\nNo , let us take a flinching look at Washington , D.C. , our nation \u2019 s capital of some 714,000 at nighttime .\nWhat has Democratic control recently secured for this city ?\nWell , more than 200 homicides for one .\nAs the Washington Post reported , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the District since 2003 .\nOf course much of that lawlessness can be chalked up to the economic contractions of Covidtide restrictions .\nClosing up shop for email workers means closing up shops for the service industry .\nClosing up schools that , failing at social engineering , are already little more than crowd control means the young and the aimless have nothing to get up to but trouble .\nNow D.C. is getting set to roll out a vaccine passport system later this month , which ( while presumably meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unvaccinated population into compliance ) will probably just further divide a city of stark inequalities .\nThanks to permissive drug and vagrancy enforcement , some of that inequality is shockingly apparent , as homeless camps provide an aesthetic counterweight to the marble and granite splendor of the American republic .\nBut D.C. is small , you say , and stateless , and so no approximation of the national Democratic agenda for governance .\nFine , then let us look to where I spent a happy graduate school year before Covid and the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humming of the country to a gasping halt .\nChicago , Hog Butcher for the World , is people butcher for itself .\nFor the first time in 25 years , the 2.6 million person City of the Big Shoulders saw more than 800 murders in 2021 .\nFamous for its palatial park system , which is still a public treasure in daylight hours , Chicago seems set to remain the field of constant warfare , and carjackings , and smash and grab organized looting .\nIt has a vaccine pass , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And in one 2021 city snapshot there were 4,477 residents experiencing homelessness , with about a quarter of those not in shelters .\nChicago has always been a troubled city , someone might be tempted to protest .\nNever mind the machine \u2019 s long hold on its governance , none of this can be blamed on Democrats or recent developments in the liberal agenda .\nIt \u2019 s the pandemic , stupid .\nWill Portland , Oregon , provide a better example ?\nUntil only quite recently ( hello Texas and Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most popular destinations in the country for permanent relocation .\nNo longer .\nIts homicide numbers are still modest , about 84 in 2021 , but this surpasses the previous record of 70 murders , set back in 1987 ( interestingly , last year broke an automobile deaths record set in the \u2019 70s , too ) .\nPortland doesn \u2019 t have a vaccine passport system yet , but the groundwork for one is being laid by the state , and many bars and restaurants require vaccine identification voluntarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portland is homelessness , as many people now know .\nThere are geographic and transportation reasons for the city to be a hub for the indigent , but the problem would not so resemble its southern mirror in San Francisco ( another city that would have been easy pickings for this column ) if what makes it a convenient place to

anniversary , two truths , a question , and a problem about incitement .\nOne truth is the 2020 campaign never really ended .\nOn paper Joe Biden became president and Donald Trump became a real estate developer again , but in reality Biden is simply a placeholder and Trump an active candidate for the presidency in 2024 .\nTrump is running against himself , or rather the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second truth is in the law , unlike in propaganda/journalism , words have very precise meanings .\nTerms like assault , for example are well-defined by decades of case law .\nYou can write junk about \u201c verbal microaggressive assault \u201d but that \u2019 s just for the rubes ; don \u2019 t expect the case to make it to court .\nThe same for terms like incitement .\nThe question is : After five years of failed , false accusations against Trump ( Russiagate on down ) , how valid of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitions into quasi-legal ones ?\nAfter so many instances of crying wolf ( walls closing in , tick tock , etc . )\n, will doing it all again , over and over again , about the events of January 6 , actually win votes for the Democratic candidate , or will voters finally realize the Emperor \u2019 s arguments about Trump have no clothes on and just stop listening ?\nThe problem is the Dems can \u2019 t win on what they have to offer .\nMost of their domestic agenda promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose Roe , and will accomplish little on immigration other than to not enforce the law on the southern border .\nEven if Mother Nature casts a vote and cleans up Covid somehow , it will be difficult for Democrats to take much credit after so many mistakes .\nThey have no clear plan for un-futzing the economy most voters live in and any progress made will be seen as catch-up at best .\nTearing down statues and appointing transpeople only goes so far .\nTheir sole strategy for 2024 is to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last election on January 6 , and having failed , chose the odd path of re-embracing the electoral process and running for president again so as to destroy democracy once in office ( i.e.\n, Orange Man Really Bad . )\nIt \u2019 s a tough ask .\nThe propaganda/journalism mandarins have failed to sway many minds .\nTo succeed will require something real , an actual court finding Trump actually guilty of an actual crime that meets the expectations set after flinging around words like treason and sedition for a year .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ York state court or empty process crime like \u201c co-conspiracy to\u2026 \u201d which dragged along the Russiagate mess , will not be enough .\nProblem One is there was no coup .\nPresided over by Trump non-accomplice Mike Pence , Congress did its job .\nBiden took office .\nTrump went home .\nThe rioters went home .\nThe system in fact worked and produced the constitutionally expected results .\nAfter a year of effort , none of the hundreds of January 6 prosecutions have been for anything close to sedition or treason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNone of the rioters claimed they acted on orders from Trump , Don Jr. or the Pillow Guy .\nDespite all the over-blown PowerPoints , there was no realistic path toward a coup taking place .\nThere is a very high bar to climb over to prove something serious like treason .\nYou need a fire to prove arson .\nThe smoking gun can \u2019 t have been loaded with blanks .\nSo the Dems and media are left with some lawyering to do , in their minds the equivalent of taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( That worked because Capone really did fail to pay taxes . )\nThus , the focus ends up on the one thing Trump actually did do on January 6 , speak at the Stop the Steal rally .\nDems argue his words constitute incitement .\nYou can reread them , but it would be more productive to spend some time learning what actually is and is notincitement .\nA democracy can \u2019 t lock up everyone who stirs up a crowd .\nSpeech which inspires , motivates , or warms the blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very stuff of democracy .\nTrump thought the election was unfair and had a Constitutional right to say so .\nDemocracy could not exist if the law held every speaker responsible for whatever people who heard him talk did later .\nA finer line is needed .\nThe first try at restricting \u201c dangerous speech \u201d was Schenck v. United States , which produced the misunderstood line about not shouting \u201c Fire !\n\u201d in a crowded theater .\nIt would be for the later case of Brandenburg v. Ohio to refine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It tightened the criteria to 1 ) the speech explicitly or implicitly encourages the use of violence or lawless action ; 2 ) the speaker intends their speech will result in the use of violence or lawless action , and 3 ) imminent violence or lawless action is the likely result of the speech .\nBrandenburg is the Supreme Court \u2019 s gold standard on what government may do about speech that seeks to incite others to lawless action .\nThe key to Brandenburg is intent .\nYou have to prove , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause violence .\nA hostile reaction of a crowd does not automatically transform protected speech into incitement .\nListeners \u2019 reaction to speech is thus not alone a basis for regulation , or for taking action against a speaker .\nThe speaker had to clearly want to cause some specific illegal act .\nYou need to prove Trump wanted the crowd to attack the Capitol ( he instead tells them to walk there and cheer on the legislators \u201c who do the right thing \u201d and \u201c to peacefully and patriotically make your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find the words to make that happen .\nBut Trump must have known how the angry crowd would react to his code words , right ?\nDoesn \u2019 t matter .\nIn the 1982 Claiborne v. NAACP the Court ruled civil rights leaders were not responsible for a crowd which , after hearing them speak , burned down a white man \u2019 s store .\nThe state \u2019 s argument , rejected by the Court , was that no matter how they disguised their dog whistles , the leaders just knew their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence .\nNope , said the Court , the standard is simple , the actual words spoken , not what the crowd did .\nThe law is similar for sedition , seeking to overthrow the government by force .\nThis is intimately tied to the concept of free speech in that any true attempt at illegal overthrow , as well as any legitimate criticism of the government , will both include persuasion and stirring up crowds .\nThe line between criticizing the government and organizing for it to be overthrown is a critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires the government prove someone conspired to use force to overthrow the government .\nSimply advocating broadly for the use of violence is not the same thing as violence and in most cases is protected as free speech .\nThat \u2019 s why no one from January 6 has been or will be charged with sedition or treason or anything similar .\nFor example , suggesting the need for revolution \u201c by any means necessary \u201d is unlikely to be seen as conspiracy to overthrow the government by force .\nActively planning such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the logistics , etc . )\ncould be considered sedition .\nBut that \u2019 s not what happened with Trump on January 6 .\nMost of the rest of the guff around Trump and January 6 is even emptier of substance , things like \u201c giving aid or comfort \u201d to those committing sedition , conspiracy to forcibly \u201c prevent , hinder or delay the execution of any law of the United States , \u201d or to corruptly impede any official proceeding .\nThe Dems \u2019 focus in this sphere is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the riot , particularly his taking three hours to issue a video request for the rioters to go home .\nThe over-arching problem is that crimes generally require you to do something .\nNot doing things , or not doing them fast enough to the Dems satisfaction , is hardly a chargeable crime .\nThe clearest sign there is nothing real behind the exaggerated claims surrounding January 6 is that after a postmortem impeachment , a full year passing , and hundreds of low-level prosecutions , nothing much has been proven .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes with nothing but media-generated smoke , the less likely there is anything more .\nThere is certainly room to judge Trump \u2019 s actions on January 6 .\nBut that judgment must come from the voters , not a kangaroo court , if you want to talk about preserving the rule of law .\nPeter Van Buren is the author of We Meant Well : How I Helped Lose the

for many urban conservatives\u2014urban centrists might be the better label\u2014Adams \u2019 triumph signified something more .\nAs the New York Times \u2019 Bret Stephens put it , he was a \u201c

anti-crime pitch especially hard following an incident last June in The Bronx , where a gang-banger opened fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages 10 and 5 , took cover nearby .\nIn response , Adams put up $ 2,000 of his own funds toward the capture of the assailant .\nThe emotion he displayed at the news conference seemed sincere ( and likely was ) .\nHe sounded similar notes through the rest of the year , cementing his status as the tough-on-crime alternative and converting more than a few skeptical urban centrists to his cause .\nThen he took office\u2014and things almost instantly soured .\nIn just his first two weeks , Adams has\u2026 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former NYPD sergeant who \u2019 d been working as assistant director of parking at Virginia Commonwealth University , to serve as deputy police

privileges of citizenship ; \u2022 signaled that he is open to remote learning in public schools , despite having vowed to defend in-person learning during the campaign\u2014a foolish move that can only invite more intransigence from teachers unions ; \u2022 and , relatedly , called United Federation of Teachers boss Mike Mulgrew his \u201c good friend \u201d with whom he shares \u201c emotional intelligence , \u201d allowing the pair to solve problems together ( eye roll , please ) .\nThat last move is especially pathetic , given that Mulgrew specifically instructed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other words , Adams owed Mulgrew absolutely nothing , yet he chose to kowtow to a figure responsible for denying schooling to some of the city \u2019 s neediest , most vulnerable kids .\nSo what are the lessons here for the urban centrists ?\nFor starters , look closer .\nSeth Barron of the Claremont Institute , for my money the sharpest and most knowledgeable observer of city affairs , was one of a very few conservatives who remained skeptical of Adams while others swooned .\nHe pointed to Adams \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association with Al Sharpton and the Nation of Islam and his concord with anti-anti-crime prosecutors , to suggest that \u201c the return to normalcy \u201d the mayor promised may have been an electoral mirage .\nSecond , beware of low expectations .\nYes , it \u2019 s probably better that Adams is governing the Big Apple , rather than one of the truly fire-breathing woke crusaders .\nBut the lesson of Adams \u2019 first two weeks is that the merely corrupt machine

\u2019 s revenue provisions carefully forswear the imposition of carbon taxes or taxes on \u201c carried equity , \u201d an apparent attempt to fulfill a campaign promise not to tax persons with incomes of less than $ 400,000 per year .\nThe tax provisions would provide a winning political formula if the Hamptons and Martha \u2019 s Vineyard were given a cumulative 350 electoral college votes .\nDiscussion of the bill has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no assessment of the merits of its programs .\nConsider here the bill \u2019 s largest component , which is intended to fight \u201c climate change.\n\u201d It is designed to move motor vehicles from gasoline to electricity power .\nEven Elon Musk , who has reaped his billions from electric-car subsidies , is dubious about the need for the expansion of such subsidies .\nSince 30 percent of the country still relies on coal as the marginal fuel for power plants , using electricity instead of gasoline to fuel millions of cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill also does not explain why the natural gas technology used by the Germans during World War II and in bus fleets since is not more promising\u2014if less pure , since it reduces rather than eliminates carbon emissions .\nThe people of Texas , like past residents of New York City , have learned that interruptions of the electrical grid , even for a few hours or days , results in chaos and lost productivity .\nThe grid , unlike gas-fed automobiles , is subject to weather dislocations and an easy target for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to society at large but individuals .\nFailing to fill a gas tank can be remedied within minutes , while failing to flip an electric switch to charge a car can produce a 12-hour delay .\nThe bill \u2019 s proposed investment in personal transportation is strange .\nHitherto \u201c progressive \u201d economists like John Kenneth Galbraith have not been devotees of what Mrs. Thatcher called \u201c the great automobile society.\n\u201d Why would progressive invest in automobiles rather than , say , high school science teaching ?\nIt \u2019 s also hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some renewables , like wind and solar , over others , like nuclear and hydroelectric power .\nThe entire \u201c global warming \u201d program is the product of a moral panic , not rational planning .\nOne can believe that man-made warming is real without forgetting that its effects will be gradual and are likely to be mitigated by human innovation and adaptation\u2014even in the absence of government action .\nInhabitants of low-slung islands and flood plains will move elsewhere .\nHome-builders will improve insulation against heat .\nNew crop strains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered , and new taxes imposed against wasteful uses .\nDiets will change .\nBiden \u2019 s plan is one-dimensional , and as former Judge Jonathan Sumption of the British Supreme Court recently deplored in the context of the pandemic , one-dimensional thinking is bound to lead to blind spots .\nBiden \u2019 s climate proposals are not the product of national planning like Jean Monnet \u2019 s \u201c indicative planning \u201d in post-war France , Albert Gallatin \u2019 s Report on Public Roads , the Hoover administration \u2019 s study of \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aborted work of Franklin Roosevelt \u2019 s National Resources Planning Board under Frederick Delano .\nThomas Jefferson , John Quincy Adams , Theodore Roosevelt , and even William Howard Taft were all futurists of a sort , looking to develop new resources : Jefferson through exploration , Adams through physical and social infrastructure , Roosevelt through conservation , and Taft through an abortive free trade agreement with Canada as a response to the closing of the American frontier .\nThere is , by contrast , nothing creative or constructive in the Democrats \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investments in oceanography , desert agriculture , or hydrology .\nIt only gives favors to interest groups .\nThe global-warming program would be rational if it were directed only at true sore spots in American society .\nThe so-called climate corps , a revived Civilian Conservation Corps , is one potentially useful program .\nWhile it is vaguely described in the bill , if it were properly directed\u2014meaning military involvement in initial training and allotments of pay to enrollees \u2019 families to develop pride , responsibility , and increase the take-up rate\u2014it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reign as the employer of first ( or last ) resort for youth in our inner cities and depressed rural areas .\nThe other provisions in the bill are a mixed bag .\nAs to its childcare provisions , the family tax credit\u2014originally a Republican initiative\u2014reduces the demand and undermines the case for publicly provided day care .\nThe socialization of pre-school , day care , and adult care is ultimately designed to drive unwilling women into the labor force and aggrandize already-too-powerful public-sector labor unions .\nThe bill \u2019 s proposed extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that opted out of the latest expansion of Medicaid , by contrast , is a defensible policy , as is its enhanced minimum wage provision , so long as it is accompanied and offset by the exclusion of young workers from payroll taxation .\nAfter all , it is alarming that the percentage of national income accounted for by wages declined from 52 percent in 1970 to 43 percent in 2019 .\nReflexive opposition is not an adequate Republican program .\nSalvageable parts of Biden \u2019 s program should be enacted as free-standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as they move us toward becoming a property-owning democracy whose citizens depend on work rather than welfare .\nBiden \u2019 s crude industrial policy that would replace the motor fleet and its fuel infrastructure is no proper part of such a program .\nGeorge Liebmann is president of the Library Company of the Baltimore Bar and author of numerous works on law and history , most recently Vox

"After two consecutive years of record violence , some on the left may be rediscovering the importance of self-defense .\nContrary to popular misconceptions , the Second Amendment did not create a right to keep and bear arms .\nRather , the Second Amendment acknowledges and seeks to protect the People \u2019 s natural right to self-defense and the tools required for the exercise of that right , which obviously include firearms .\nThis is why the amendment speaks of \u201c the right \u201d to arms as something already in existence and not to be infringed\u2014rather than as something newly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Supreme Court .\nIt should not be a polarized and partisan issue .\nHistorically , the right of armed self-defense was understood and exercised by figures who were far from

high , fueled by people \u2019 s concern for their safety .\nThe Washington Examiner \u2019 s Sarah Westwood recently chronicled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s remorse \u201d on issues of crime and safety , and left-leaning areas \u2019 embrace of firearms .\nEven NPR was forced to acknowledge the racial and political diversity of new gun owners and the legitimacy of their concerns .\nThese new gun buyers

temporarily legalized , and says that the LAPD \u201c can \u2019 t guarantee your safety , \u201d many Californians understand that their safety is up to them .\nAs Westwood noted , concealed carry permit applications in Los Angeles County have increased more than tenfold in recent years .\nJournalist Michael Shellenberger chronicled the same attitude shift among Beverly Hills liberals in a recent piece : \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in the past , \u2018 I \u2019 ll never own a gun \u2019 are calling me asking about firearms , \u201d a private security executive said .\nLikewise , Seattle ,

just not taking pollsters .\nOther Democratic gun-owners could be holding onto old ideologies out of step with their real-world behavior .\nWhat \u2019 s clear overall is that 2020 and 2021 have changed the social landscape on self-defense and firearms .\nNaturally , politicians and anti-gun activists will keep up their familiar refrains , which have long been staples of the left-wing

.\nMy decision to speak forthrightly was not made lightly .\nEven now I find myself hesitating .\nBut to remain silent , at this juncture , while the fate of our democracy hangs in the balance , would be inexcusable .\nIn 2012 , I made a last-minute attempt to vote in the presidential election , mostly because I had opinions about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c medical cannabis \u201d in the state of Michigan .\nWhen I arrived at what I thought was my designated polling place , I was turned away at the door .\nAccording to the designated election watchers , a pair of gray-haired lady librarian Democrats of a kind that is now vanishingly rare , I was not registered in that ward .\nMoreover , they said , my driver \u2019 s license was expired .\nThey simply could not allow me to cast even a provisional ballot .\nThis grotesque violation of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , when , after a half-decade sojourn in Washington , D.C. , I returned to the greatest state in the union .\nHere the clerk at the secretary of state office who gave me a new Michigan driver \u2019 s license after I paid multiple outstanding speeding tickets by phone did not ask me whether I wished to register to vote , even though she had done the same thing for my wife a few weeks earlier .\nThis meant that a few years later when I tried to slip away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Tulsi Gabbard in the 2016 Michigan Democratic Primary , I was once again denied my \u201c voting rights.\n\u201d I wish I could say that I was joking about all of the above , but I am solemnly assured by Democratic politicians , including our president during his recent trip to Georgia , that both of these seemingly anodyne incidents were not the consequences of my own laziness ( and low-grade criminality ) but privations worthy of Jim Crow .\nTo insist that a person wishing to take part in a presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with valid picture ID , is tantamount to a denial of the franchise itself .\nThis , I take it , is why Kyrsten Sinema , apparently the second openly LGBTQIA+ woman elected to the United States Senate and the former co-host of a 9/11 truther radio program , is now a hate figure in progressive circles .\nSinema , you see , has discovered that sitting on the threshold between the two parties is an enviable position in an evenly divided upper chamber .\nAs I write this , Sinema is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a considerable portion of her donor support because she does not support eliminating the filibuster\u2014don \u2019 t ask me what that means\u2014to pass what mainstream newspapers now uniformly refer to as \u201c voting rights \u201d legislation .\nI am still not entirely sure what this phrase means .\nIf the proposed legislation is any indication , \u201c voting rights \u201d means being able to request what we still quaintly refer to as \u201c absentee \u201d ballots months ahead of time , to be able to deposit these pieces of paper in virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register while standing in line on election day without a driver \u2019 s license ( despite having somehow already had one \u2019 s mail-in ballot \u201c harvested \u201d ) , and goodness knows what else .\nBy these standards , virtually no one in the history of this country enjoyed the exercise of his or her voting rights until last fall .\nHow in the world this maximalist understanding of voting rights is compatible with vaccine mandates ( which also require photo ID , lest some wag borrow his friend \u2019 s CDC-issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not say .\nPart of me wishes that a cynical Republican would suggest a new bipartisan deal that involves a nationwide vaccine mandate for voting .\nBut what I really hate about all of these meta-conversations is the bad faith from both sides .\nBy now it should be possible for

at all , but barring that , I would not require identification for voting any more than I would for the purchase of alcoholic beverages or tobacco .\nI would also eliminate licenses for driving automobiles , which do not meaningfully increase the quality of drivers anyway .\nUntil the world comes around to my view of things , however , I will continue to lament the onerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when

won the first-ever primaries held by opposition parties in Hungary .\nM\u00e1rki-Zaya \u2019 s potential to bring undecided or even conservative voters to the opposition was seen as a trump card to defeat Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n in the general election on April 3 .\nP\u00e9ter M\u00e1rki-Zay has been showered with praise and interview opportunities on CNN , as well as French and German media outlets .\nPolitico \u2018 s European outfit put him on their list of most influential people to watch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the European People \u2019 s Party \u2019 s Manfred Weber and Donald Tusk , and several European commissioners all met with him .\nHowever , the honeymoon phase is over , and many on the left are now ringing the alarm bells .\nHungary \u2019 s opposition parties\u2014socialists , liberals , greens , and far-right Jobbik\u2014announced their formal electoral alliance in December 2020 .\nTheir idea was simple enough : If they combined their forces , they could beat the center-right alliance of Fidesz and the Christian Democratic People \u2019 s Party ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear mandates with two-third majorities in the national elections of 2010 , 2014 , and 2018 .\nOpposition parties held joint primaries this autumn to select common candidates for each of the 106 constituencies as well as a common prime minister candidate .\nThe primaries have dominated headlines in the Hungarian media for months .\nYet , the political outcome was mixed , to say the least .\nFormer socialist prime minister Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny \u2019 s Democratic Coalition ( D.K . )\nparty came out on top .\nHis candidates won the primaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kl\u00e1ra Dobrev , finished on top after the first round of the prime minister-candidates \u2019 race .\nBut Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny has been the most toxic public figure in Hungary since 2006 , when a leaked recording of him admitting to lying and misleading the public to win re-election that year aired on radio .\nConsequently , thousands protested in the streets of Budapest and police used brutal force against demonstrators .\n( These events coincided with the 50th anniversary of the 1956 revolution , when Hungarians revolted against the Stalinist regime .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet tanks put a brutal end to the revolution . )\nThe events of 2006 shocked the entire country .\nHowever , Gyurcs\u00e1ny held on to power until 2009 and has remained a member of parliament ever since .\nAfter leaving the socialist party , he formed a party of his own , which grew into the strongest opposition party in the 2019 European parliamentary elections .\nThe second round of primaries would decide the opposition \u2019 s prime minister candidate .\nBehind Kl\u00e1ra Dobrev , Gergely Kar\u00e1cson , the mayor of Budapest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winner .\nHowever , he came in second .\nP\u00e9ter M\u00e1rki-Zay , running as an independent , surprisingly finished third .\nThe three of them qualified for the second round .\nLiberal outlets worried , because Kar\u00e1csony and M\u00e1rki-Zay risked splitting what the left considered centrist-liberal voters .\nThis would have effectively handed Dobrev the victory with a relative majority .\nBecause of her husband , Dobrev obtaining the candidacy was widely considered likely to lead to a resounding defeat of the opposition at the elections this year .\nP\u00e9ter M\u00e1rki-Zay and Gergely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled out under ambiguous circumstances .\nHe announced that he would step down and support M\u00e1rki-Zay , and his support was about as sincere as Bernie Sanders \u2019 s when he backed Hillary Clinton in 2016 .\nM\u00e1rki-Zay \u2019 s aggressiveness and self-portrayal as a Christian conservative was seen as a game-changer in winning over undecided voters .\nFinally , a fresh face who could turn the tables\u2014or so many claimed .\nHe was expected to deliver the undecided voters to the opposition , and perhaps even gain the support of some disgruntled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition leading the ruling Fidesz-KDNP alliance .\nIn December , the first public-opinion poll ordered by the opposition created a major shock .\nThe anti-Fidesz media nervously reported that 52 percent of Hungarians would like to see the governing parties stay in power , while only 43 percent would like to see a change in government .\nSupport for the alliance of Fidesz-KDNP was measured at 46 percent and the opposition alliance at only 32 percent .\nA conservative think tank \u2019 s report also confirmed the opposition \u2019 s poor performance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming the prime minister candidate in October .\nM\u00e1rki-Zay had made very negative comments about the most popular policies of Viktor Orb\u00e1n \u2019 s government : zero tolerance on illegal immigration and a cap on energy prices for households .\nM\u00e1rki-Zay also expressed readiness to scrap the minimum wage ( which is now higher than the average wage was during the socialist-liberal governments , and which was raised again as of 2022 ) .\nFurthermore , M\u00e1rki-Zay had his \u201c deplorables \u201d moment , labeling Hungarians who support border protection and the cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and \u201c mushrooms , kept in the dark , fed manure.\n\u201d He later doubled down on his statement , repeating the word \u201c dumb \u201d over and over again .\nHis oft-humiliating remarks about his allies have continually made coordination difficult and caused party leaders to consistently and publicly shoot back at him .\nA new low of the campaign occurred on January 9 , when M\u00e1rki-Zay made anti-Semitic comments during one of his regular Sunday Facebook live videos .\nEven leftist journalists and analysts publicly expressed their outrage .\nSome did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of victory and called for the elections as soon as possible to put the opposition out of its political misery .\nStill others hinted at hiding M\u00e1rki-Zay from the public until election day .\nJewish organizations also slammed M\u00e1rki-Zay for his words .\nWhite-washing Jobbik , the traditional party home for anti-Semitism , of its bigotry\u2014at least on the surface\u2014was the bare minimum needed to make a unified opposition a reality for this election cycle .\nThis has been a long and concerted effort that has taken several years .\nBack in @ @ @ @ @ @

called on the attorney general to outright ban Jobbik .\nYet today , D.K .\nand Jobbik are the backbone of the opposition \u2019 s electoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the most seats on the opposition side .\nAs one might predict , the left in Europe and the United States still remain silent about M\u00e1rki-Zay \u2019 s comments , just as they remained silent when the electoral alliance with Jobbik was announced .\nThe opposition parties still have no manifesto on which they can agree on , nor a flagship policy proposal .\nTheir only visible call to action is a collection of signatures to organize a referendum with two questions , one about blocking a Chinese university from starting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about extending the duration of the unemployment benefits .\nThe highlight of the announcement was when P\u00e9ter M\u00e1rki-Zay , speaking on behalf the large group of opposition candidates behind him and apparently clueless about their new unified proposal , said that the opposition alliance wanted to extend the unemployment benefit to 90 days .\nHe was corrected by his advisor , who said that their aim was to extend it to 180 days .\nThat was wrong again .\nA third person intervened from the crowd behind him to finally get it right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) as their goal .\nAfter a quick discussion on the spot they agreed that 270 days was , in fact , the correct number .\nEveryone who saw the press conference\u2014from politicians to journalists to average citizens\u2014was stupefied by this level of incompetence .\nThe opposition must also agree on a common party list .\nIn the Hungarian parliament , 106 seats are won in single constituencies and 93 seats are apportioned according to votes cast for party lists .\nAs prime minister candidate , M\u00e1rki-Zay had plans to form a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between seven , rather than six , opposition groupings .\nHe was denied by opposition parties in early January , but M\u00e1rki-Zay expressed hope that the parties still might change their minds .\nIn countries with so many parties in a ruling coalition , coming to an agreement often takes several months .\nThe Hungarian opposition must now pull this off in record time and with no prior experience .\nThe parties are losing their patience with M\u00e1rki-Zay .\nThis does not bode well for their desired national-election outcome this coming April\u2014to best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of

very beginning .\nAs late as July 2021 , top members of Congress were urging their constituents to get vaccinated in hopes that appeasement would be a winning strategy in avoiding the mandates that conservatives had been prophesying for months .\nDays later , Mayor Bill de Blasio issued a vaccine mandate for New York City , and the nationwide employee mandates and the military \u2019 s mandate followed in rapid succession .\nInstead of getting out ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once again , chose a laissez-faire strategy , content to complain about \u201c tyranny \u201d after the fact rather than attempt to prevent it before .\nSo before your inbox is inundated with fundraising emails from the Republican National Convention and Republican congressional leadership , full of all-caps harangues begging you to help put them back in power and win back the majority in November , remember that all of this Covid madness started with a Republican majority in the Senate and a Republican president .\nRemember that lockdowns and masks were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington , even after their constituents back home started rattling the cage .\nRemember that , whatever Kevin McCarthy tweets about Congress being a one-party system , these people were still elected and may still be challenged in primaries by candidates who could better serve the American people .\nYes , Republicans should want to win back the House in November , and no , politicians will never be perfect .\nBut there comes a point , especially after the last two years , when we must draw a clear line between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important issues , which have , for the most part , been ignored by those in power\u2014questions of the tension between public health and public trust , or the proper roles of our pharmaceutical companies and federal health agencies\u2014for which we need men of sound judgment .\nHow many of our Republicans lacked such judgment , especially when it came to locking down the entire nation overnight , or foreseeing harmful and discriminatory vaccine mandates ?\nIf they can be bowled over by every strong wind , they are little better than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaining about , whatever

about taking a vaccine for the coronavirus , \u201c but our patience is wearing thin.\n\u201d When Joe Biden said those words in an address in September , a political norm was cast aside .\nCould it

produced during Hollywood \u2019 s Golden Age , Elia Kazan \u2019 s Depression-era drama Wild River .\nThe 20th Century Fox release from 1960 stars Montgomery Clift as Chuck Glover , an official with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plucked from a comfy desk job in Washington and deposited in rural Tennessee with a single instruction : urge , and if necessary insist upon , the relocation of an iron-willed old woman , Ella Garth ( Jo Van Fleet ) , from her island on the Tennessee River to enable the construction of a hydroelectric dam .\nLazily residing on Ella \u2019 s property is a smattering of family members and workers , including her grown sons , Cal , Hamilton , and Joe John ; her widowed granddaughter , Carol ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands .\nThe land is parched and plain , but evocative too\u2014a little like Brigadoon in the American South .\n\u201c There were some people who had lived on this land for generations , \u201d says the opening narration , written by screenwriter Paul Osborn , which states the theme baldly but elegantly .\n\u201c There were some people who refused to sell , under any persuasion whatsoever.\n\u201d Chuck knows what he is up against , even respects it some , but he is certain he can overcome it .\n\u201c Rugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says to his skeptical , seen-it-all TVA staff ( including Kazan \u2019 s future spouse , actress Barbara Loden , later the auteur responsible for the 1970 working-class masterpiece Wanda ) .\n\u201c We applaud that spirit , we admire it , we believe in it .\nBut we got to get her the hell out of there.\n\u201d Translation : Don \u2019 t be too rugged or individualistic .\nThe TVA aims to solve two problems by intentionally flooding the land and constructing a dam : to assure that the river no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural flooding , and to bring electric power to communities that lack it .\nCertain that he is doing , if not the Lord \u2019 s work then at least FDR \u2019 s , Chuck lands on Ella \u2019 s island brimming with confidence .\n\u201c I do think we often underestimate the intelligence of people , \u201d he insists to his TVA officemates .\n\u201c We can talk to them , and they will listen.\n\u201d He leaves not only having failed to engage Ella , who marches inside from her front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also roughed up by the portly but strong Joe John , who , without breaking a sweat , lobs Chuck into the river .\nThe initial interaction between Chuck and Ella has a certain comic quality : the man in the suit and tie contending with a bunch of bumpkins .\nBut , just a few scenes later , Kazan gives Ella the floor to explain her position to her assembled kith and kin and a visiting Chuck .\nShe rails against the government and its plan to put otherwise proud people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of Socratic dialogue with the field hand Sam , Ella explains her unwillingness to give up that which is rightfully hers by acting as though she intends to buy Sam \u2019 s dog , Blue .\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to give you , oh , I \u2019 ll give you 15 dollars for him , \u201d Ella says , but Sam\u2014played by Robert Earl Jones , father of James Earl , with something of the same vocal authority\u2014refuses .\n\u201c Old Blue is mine , and I ain \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you.\n\u201d Having proven her point , Ella reflects : \u201c Sam and me , we don \u2019 t sell .\nSam don \u2019 t sell his dog , and I don \u2019 t sell my land that I poured my heart \u2019 s blood into.\n\u201d As delivered by fortysomething Van Fleet , with makeup , wardrobe , and a stoop to make her look far older , Ella \u2019 s argument is as heart-rending as the famous lines spoken by John Qualen in John Ford \u2019 s adaptation of The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took up this land 70 years ago .\nMy pa was born here .\nWe was all born on it .\nAnd some of us was killed on it\u2026 and some of us died on it.\n\u201d To be sure , Kazan and Osborn let Chuck make his counterarguments .\nConfronting Ella , he rightly refers to the Tennessee River as a \u201c killer \u201d for its perpetual flooding , and he properly points out the tangible benefits of electrifying the valley .\nYet it is almost ridiculous when Chuck promises Carol that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will have a radio and \u201c a modern kitchen \u201d to look forward to .\nThe sad thing is that Chuck means it .\nWhen Ella finally gives up the fight and is dropped off at her new home , it \u2019 s every bit as cheesy as he promised\u2014a simulacrum of her actual homestead , with a rocking chair placed on her new front porch for effect .\nBorn in Constantinople in 1909 , Kazan was a youthful leftist whose fleeting membership in the Communist Party of America in the 1930s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communism that climaxed with the testimony he gave to the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1952 .\nKazan \u2019 s truth-telling resulted in lost friendships , but sometimes it pays to be despised : His best , most clear-headed films\u2014including On the Waterfront , Splendor in the Grass , and Wild River\u2014were made after he no longer cared what the left thought of him .\nLiberated , Kazan altered his approach to the film that became Wild River , which , in its earlier incarnations , was meant to be told from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c My first idea was an affectionate look back on our youth , \u201d Kazan wrote in a 1959 letter to screenwriter Osborn , who based his script on two novels , William Bradford Huie \u2019 s Mud on the Stars and Borden Deal \u2019 s Dunbar \u2019 s Cove .\n\u201c I remember the days of the New Deal with a special feeling .\nI was in some of it , and very much enlisted in all of it .\nIt was the best period of my life when I liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best.\n\u201d Yet this was no longer the story Kazan wanted Osborn to help him tell .\nInstead , Kazan saw Wild River , as he put it , as \u201c a love story between two opposites \u201d : Kazan clearly saw Chuck \u2019 s gentle , unhurried courtship of Carol as a metaphor for the way he comes to comprehend Ella \u2019 s perspective .\n\u201c You might oversimplify the story thus , \u201d Kazan wrote to Osborn .\n\u201c A man is assigned to kill someone .\nHe falls in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sic ] kill them .\nInstead he joins them.\n\u201d In his 1988 autobiography , Kazan got to the heart of the matter : \u201c While my man from Washington had the \u2018 social \u2019 right on his side , the picture I made was in sympathy with the old woman obstructing progress.\n\u201d And so we return to our present pandemic moment .\nThose who support mask and vaccine mandates may or may not have , in Kazan \u2019 s formulation , the \u201c social right \u201d on their side .\nWhether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we ought to follow Kazan \u2019 s example in extending sympathy for those ordinary people whose instincts tell them such things are unjust , unfair , and just plain wrong .\nLike Ella Garth , these people earnestly feel they are within their rights to navigate life as they see fit , and that includes life during a pandemic .\nLike Ella , they may ultimately lose the fight .\n\u201c It won \u2019 t take much force , but it will take some , \u201d Ella tells Glover of being moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declines to present Ella \u2019 s defeat as the TVA \u2019 s victory .\nThe ending , in which Ella is removed , her house torched , and the dam built , is far from triumphant\u2014not because the TVA \u2019 s mission was inherently unworthy or unreasonable but because its human toll was unacceptably high .\nThe inclusion of such ambiguities is what makes Wild River great .\nAs Kazan knew , the best films resist simplicity and invite complexity .\nThat \u2019 s why , if a future Kazan-like Hollywood director is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the pandemic , it won \u2019 t reiterate Anthony Fauci \u2019 s talking points but seek to understand Americans battered by this whole affair\u2014those regular people exhausted , weary , and rightly skeptical of public-health interventions and edicts .\nSuch courage in Hollywood is rare .\nSixty-two years after the release of Wild River , it remains remarkable that Elia Kazan\u2014one-time Communist Party member , Broadway legend , Oscar-winning director\u2014found common Tennesseans worthy of his affection , their mulish objection to what is called progress deserving of his attention .\nYet Kazan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere \u2019 s a sweetness in this film unlike anything else in his career , not unlike the hymn \u201c In the Garden \u201d that Lee Remick softly sings at one point : \u201c And the joy we share as we tarry there\u2026 \u201d In his autobiography , Kazan suggested that his relationship with Loden , whom he describes as \u201c a \u2018 hillbilly \u2019 from the backcountry of North Carolina , \u201d awakened him to the beauty of wild things and wild people .\n\u201c Barbara was as wild as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d There \u2019 s a lesson in all this : If Elia Kazan can love people who once seemed to him his adversaries , so can Joe Biden .\nSo , Mr. President , please consider watching Wild River if you haven \u2019 t seen it lately .\nThe film will tell you that you needn \u2019 t concede your own belief in \u201c the science \u201d \u2014like Chuck Glover \u2019 s belief in \u201c progress \u201d \u2014to respect those of your fellow Americans who quietly but defiantly dissent

, and in the last instance decisions are made at an individual level .\nAnd inevitable .\nCall it the ineluctable burden of freedom .\nPresident Trump and Governor DeSantis faced obloquy two years ago

.\n\u201c Then how do I work ?\nWhat do I do with my kid ?\n\u201d The newfound libertarian bent of my colleague , who would rather assess risk for herself than have it dictated to her , is reflective of an axiom of human existence .\nAs it turns out , individual choice could be kicked down the road by government fiat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , we now have vaccines ; yes , we now have a greater arsenal of therapeutics .\nBut as Omicron challenges the heretofore prevailing wisdom around living life semi-normally while still meaningfully preventing exposure to the disease , we are all faced with a

, \u201c The God who made New Hampshire taunted the lofty land with little men.\n\u201d He was from Massachusetts .\nTruth be told , our two states have always hated each other .\nMassachusetts thinks New Hampshire is full of bumpkins and yokels ; New Hampshire thinks Massachusetts is full of snobs and prigs .\nIt \u2019 s something of a tradition .\nAccording to the great Alan Taylor , when the Puritans began to spread north from Boston , they found the New Hampshire seacoast already settled by \u201c fishing folk , nominal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingled uneasily.\n\u201d I \u2019 m sure that \u2019 s putting it mildly .\nFast forward to the 1850s and we find Mr. Emerson , the puritanical progressive , still seething .\nThe \u201c little men \u201d line had to do with New Hampshire \u2019 s stance on slavery .\nOf course , most Granite Staters were abolitionists .\nFranklin Pierce , New Hampshire \u2019 s only president , was even called a \u201c wicked free-soiler \u201d by Abraham Lincoln .\n( As it happens , Pierce made a name for himself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That \u2019 s part of the reason Emerson hated him and , by extension , New Hampshire .\nBack then , Massachusetts liberals thought Texas should belong to the Mexicans .\nIf you can believe such a thing . )\nThen as now , Massachusetts was more urban and progressive ; New Hampshire was rural and conservative .\nYou might assume that Massachusetts was therefore more committed to emancipation , but that isn \u2019 t true .\nThe two states differed on means , not ends .\nFarm-folk like Pierce were afraid that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong way , it would ruin the South \u2019 s agrarian economy and plunge everyone , black and white , into poverty .\nEmerson didn \u2019 t care about that .\nHe considered farm work stifling and degrading .\nIf it collapsed along with chattel slavery , Emerson wouldn \u2019 t mourn it .\nEmerson \u2019 s circle became so unhinged that one of its core members , Orestes Brownson , not only abandoned the Transcendentalist movement but defected to the Catholic Church .\nBrownson , like Pierce , was both a staunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a son of Vermont farmers ; Vermont , like New Hampshire , always chafed under the Massachusetts hegemon .\nIn one essay , Brownson lambasts a certain kind of Yankee radical , a fellow who \u2019 s always seeking to make all the world like himself , or as uneasy as himself\u2026 He is philanthropic , but makes his philanthropy his excuse for meddling with everybody \u2019 s business as if it were his own , and under pretense of promoting religion and morality , he wars against every generous and natural instinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeks to cure .\nOf course , he was talking about Emerson .\nNo doubt he meant Emerson , too , when he decried those \u201c madmen amongst us who talk of exterminating the Southern leaders , and of New Englandizing the South.\n\u201d But when push came to shove , both Brownson and Pierce threw in their lot with the Union .\nAnd I think they were right to do so .\nWhy do I bring all of this up ?\nBecause given what I \u2019 m about to say I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m not trying to rehash the Civil War .\nOn the contrary .\nMy ancestors came to New England in the 1630s .\nThey fought for the Union , and I \u2019 m proud of their service .\nI \u2019 m not a \u201c neo-Confederate \u201d by any stretch .\nAnd neither are the 47 percent of Americans who agree with me .\nYes , 47 percent .\nAccording to a University of Virginia poll published this September , 41 percent of Biden voters and 52 percent of Trump voters say \u201c it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , favoring blue/red states seceding from the Union.\n\u201d No poll has caused the pundit class so much anxiety since the denizens of NoVa voted to rename their football team the Washington Palefaces .\nYet it \u2019 s a perfectly sensible solution to a problem that \u2019 s been dragging on far too long now .\nBy the time North and South got to fighting , the civil war in New England had already been raging for 200 years .\nI \u2019 m a citizen of New Hampshire .\nAsk me if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina and my answer is no .\nLong live the Union , etc .\nBut ask me if I want to secede from Massachusetts and you can call me Johnny Reb .\nThe best reason for breaking up the states is also the most obvious : there \u2019 s way too many of them .\nThe idea that one government can effectively govern 300 million people spread over 4 million square miles and worth about $ 23 trillion is absurd .\nThere \u2019 s no way the interests of Maine , Kentucky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ align even half the time .\nGive statehood to Puerto Rico and it becomes even more ridiculous .\nIt \u2019 s not that we \u2019 re hostile to each other .\nWe don \u2019 t even know each other .\nWhy does some putz in Chicago get a say in how much I pay for taxes ?\nAnd why should I get a say in what his kids learn at school ?\nActually , Chicago has twice the population of New Hampshire .\nThat one city not only makes my state irrelevant : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair ?\nThe numbers just don \u2019 t work out .\nCalifornia has as many eligible voters as Utah , Nevada , Iowa , Alaska , Mississippi , Kansas , New Mexico , Nebraska , Idaho , West Virginia , Hawaii , New Hampshire , Maine , Montana , Rhode Island , Delaware , North Dakota , South Dakota , Alaska , Vermont , and Wyoming put together .\nThe ten most populous states contain more people than the other 40 .\nAnd despite the Electoral College ( long to reign over us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bully the little \u2019 uns .\nThat \u2019 s why , if you \u2019 re a Democrat , you \u2019 d better be a San Francisco Democrat .\nThat \u2019 s also why the GOP is chronically saddled with mediocre Texans like Bush Jr. and Ted Cruz , though mediocre Floridians also seem to be having a moment .\nAnd here we come to our second point .\nThere \u2019 s too much freedom of movement within the United States .\nAs we speak , thousands of Boston commuters are moving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Granite State but because they can \u2019 t afford the Bay State .\nThe North Shore of Massachusetts is too expensive , and the suburbs are too dangerous .\nThey come here , where property is a bit cheaper and taxes are much lower ( especially for renters ) .\nBut , naturally , this influx of white-collar office workers is driving up real estate costs .\nFarming communities like Hollis are being leveled by developers .\nWhole forests are mowed down , with row after row of condos and McMansions sown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newcomers are bringing their liberal values with them .\nIn just a couple of election cycles , New Hampshire has gone from a libertarian stronghold to fielding an all-Democratic congressional delegation .\nOur governor is a moderate , small-government Republican , but he has to keep vetoing legislation that would create New Hampshire \u2019 s first-ever income tax .\n( New Hampshire has the lowest poverty rate in the country . )\nSince the whole Rittenhouse affair , Democrats have also been trying to enact our first-ever open carry ban .\n( New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country . )\nThese days , Massachusetts isn \u2019 t just browbeating New Hampshire .\nIt \u2019 s colonizing us .\nThe same thing is happening all over the country .\nLiberals have destroyed their own states , so now they \u2019 re moving to prosperous red states , turning them blue , and wrecking them , too .\nMost famous is the California-to-Texas pipeline , which has formed as progressives flee the literal shitholes they \u2019 ve created in Los Angeles and San Francisco .\nA friend of mine just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I asked him how it was , he said , \u201c It rained the night before we flew in so there wasn \u2019 t as much feces on the sidewalk as last year.\n\u201d That \u2019 s a good day in the Golden State .\nBut what if I like New Hampshire the way it is ?\nWhat if I want to keep the guns , the low taxes , and the family farms ?\nAnd what if Texans don \u2019 t want their state to become another California ?\nWhat if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a bunch of half-naked , leather-clad BDSM freaks marching down the street during the town \u2019 s weekly Pride Parade ?\n\u201c Listen , pardner : \u2019 round here , we wear Levi \u2019 s under our chaps.\n\u201d This is why states \u2019 rights matter , and I don \u2019 t want to hear any of that smarmy APUSH crap .\nTry to make a nuanced point and some genius will say , \u201c Oh , sure .\nThe Civil War was only fighting for states \u2019 rights\u2014to own slaves.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room like it \u2019 s the cleverest thing he \u2019 s ever said , probably because it is .\nNow flash-forward 160 years .\nTexans have to sit on their hands while Californians migrate to their state en masse , shoot heroin at the bus stop , take a dump on the sidewalk , and use tax dollars to pay for their kid \u2019 s sex change .\nThat \u2019 s wrong .\nIt \u2019 s wrong because red states shouldn \u2019 t have those failed , blue-state policies imposed on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because liberals should be made to live with the consequences of their own bad policies .\nIf they did , they wouldn \u2019 t enact those policies .\nAs it stands , they \u2019 re just going to keep defraying the economic , social , and cultural cost across the entire country .\nThey won \u2019 t stop until every town in America is as rich as Detroit , as safe as Chicago , as clean as New York City .\nThere are nonpolitical arguments for secession .\nFor instance , all culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that includes agriculture .\nThe interstate supply chain can guarantee Maine blueberries in Louisiana and Florida oranges to Colorado , but all that shipping wreaks havoc on the environment .\nBesides , as everyone knows , preservatives make our food less healthy .\nIn addition to making everything taste funny , flash-freezing also reduces the vitamin content .\nIn fact , any produce grown on an industrial farm is going to come from nutrient-depleted soil , which practically eliminates the health benefits of eating fruits and veggies .\nSmall-scale , organic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy .\nIt creates more resilient markets that are far less likely to be disrupted by war or fluctuations in the stock market .\nWithin living memory , upwards of 25 percent of the U.S. workforce consisted of independent farmers .\nFarming is ( or can be ) a terrific career for those who want to own property and make a comfortable living without the need for much formal education .\nBut we can \u2019 t have local , sustainable , and affordable agriculture , because independent farmers can \u2019 t compete with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult for individual states to act against corporate farming monopolies .\nWhy ?\nIn part , because the jurisprudence around the Commerce Clause has been expanded to say that only the federal government can deal with national and multinational companies .\nAnd since Big Ag has one of the most powerful lobbies on Capitol Hill , rural states are totally unable to stand up for their farmers .\nBesides all that , I don \u2019 t think we \u2019 re even aware of how much biodiversity has been sacrificed for our insane desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , my father-in-law is a connoisseur of apples .\nThis Thanksgiving , we had nod head apples , which are indigenous to New Hampshire .\nThey \u2019 re named after a local farmer ( some say minister ) from the 1800s named Samuel Jewett , who was known for nodding his head when he walked .\nNod heads beat galas or granny smiths like a gong .\nAnd yet I \u2019 d never heard of them before .\nNor have 99 percent of New Hampshiremen , I \u2019 d bet .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , there are pockets of resistance to this homogenizing , stultifying globalism .\nThe craze for craft beers and \u201c microbrews \u201d is heartening .\nHere in the Granite State , we \u2019 ve progressed from thirty IPAs to sixty APAs to 120 NHPAs .\nBut it \u2019 s worth pointing out that , until the 1950s , pretty much every brew was a microbrew .\nOnce again , it was the federal government that helped Big Suds establish a monopoly\u2014and just after the end of Prohibition , too .\nThe modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Founding Fathers envisioned .\nThe notion of Manifest Destiny , of a transcontinental empire , has nothing to do with \u201c just Powers from the Consent of the Governed.\n\u201d The Declaration also declares that ours is a union of \u201c Free and Independent States , \u201d but that \u2019 s hard to square with the annexation of independent republics like Texas ( 1845 ) and California ( 1846 ) , never mind the Kingdom of Hawaii ( 1893 ) .\nAnd that \u2019 s another thing .\nIf an American is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , then it \u2019 s really no surprise our government has plunged itself into so many foreign wars .\nOur message to Vietnam and Syria is the same as our message to Texas and Hawaii : \u201c We \u2019 re going to liberate you , whether you like it or not.\n\u201d History tells us nothing if not this : when small , virtuous , freedom-loving nations get too big , they inevitably kill themselves with a deadly mixture of ambition and decadence .\nThey \u2019 re too greedy to be content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so they end up devouring themselves .\nIt happened to the British Empire , and the Roman Empire before it .\nNo doubt it will happen to the American Empire in due course .\nIt doesn \u2019 t have to be that way .\nThe various \u201c exit \u201d movements , from Brexit to Calexit , show that the cracks run deeper than we may have expected .\nYou might say that Westerners , both on the Right and the Left , are getting tired of trying to force themselves on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we hate each other .\nOn the contrary .\nIt \u2019 s that we love each other enough to try salvaging what \u2019 s left of our relationship .\nFriends don \u2019 t always make good housemates .\nSometimes , they make the very worst housemates .\nMaybe we all just need a little space .\nA wise man once said , \u201c Love your neighbor as yourself.\n\u201d But \u201c Good fences make good neighbors , \u201d said another .\nI don \u2019 t know about you but , at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I want more than anything .\nI \u2019 m not really a secessionist , I \u2019 m an Anti-Federalist .\nI only want to do what the Founding Fathers did : to \u201c throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security.\n\u201d Forget about making America great again for a minute .\nLet \u2019 s all go our separate ways and see what happens .\nMaine and Hawaii might not get back together again , but who knows ?\nAbsence makes the heart grow fonder .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ join its new Lone Star Republic .\nI hope the northeast would reorganize itself into a Commonwealth of New England\u2014though , at this point , New York may as well take Connecticut .\nAt the very least , it would give the states a chance to reshuffle .\nNorCal and southern Oregon could form their State of Jefferson .\nThey could team up with northern Idaho and eastern Washington , otherwise known as the State of Lincoln .\nAnd wouldn \u2019 t it be easier if there was just one Dakota ?\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to maximize freedom for individual Americans while creating a more efficient and accountable government .\nIt \u2019 s to preserve and to celebrate our nation \u2019 s incredible diversity\u2014its many histories and geographies , traditions and folkways .\nReally , there \u2019 s nothing special about the United States of America , but there \u2019 s something extraordinary about each of the fifty states that make up our republic .\nTo blend them all together would be such a waste .\nNew York gave us Teddy Roosevelt .\nTexas gave us Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMassachusetts gave us Emerson , though it wasn \u2019 t all bad .\nWhat has New Texafornichusetts given us ?\nDonald Trump and Meghan Markle .\nThat \u2019 s not so great .\nIn the year 2021 , if we want to make America great again , we all need a little time to ourselves .\nBecause you can \u2019 t love a forest if you \u2019 ve never loved a tree , and you can \u2019 t love the United States until you \u2019 ve learned to love a state .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ slice of America you call home , and the people you call neighbors .\nOnce we \u2019 ve relearned those loves , maybe then we can get the band back together .\nJust as long as our loyalty belongs to America first and the Union second .\nJust as long as we love our country\u2014and our countrymen\u2014more than our government .\nThat \u2019 s how the Founding Fathers wanted it .\nAnd , you know , they were a lot smarter than we give them

inevitable .\nThis is not one of those chin-tugging cases of \u201c the law of unintended consequences , \u201d in which well-meaning officials are undone by the unforeseen effects of their best efforts .\nOn the contrary : Secretary Mayorkas is an open borders zealot .\nWhat the rest of the country calls a disaster , Mayorkas considers as a job well done .\nIn 2020 , under President Trump \u2019 s comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States saw the fewest illegal border crossings in four decades , 53 percent fewer than the year before .\nBut Mayorkas and President Biden began rolling back those policies as soon as they took office .\nIn less than a year , the Mayorkas DHS has revoked the \u201c public charge rule , \u201d which allowed DHS agents to deny entry to foreigners likely to become dependent on government welfare ; quadrupled the number of refugees the U.S. will take in ; announced an end to Trump \u2019 s policy of expelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; halted construction of the border wall ; rescinded the \u201c Remain in Mexico \u201d policy negotiated between the Trump Administration and the Mexican government , whereby asylum seekers trying to enter the U.S. from Mexico had to stay there until their cases got resolved ; allowed U.S. arrests at the Mexican border to sink to an eight-month low in October ; and announced a halt to raids on businesses employing illegal aliens , giving them carte blanche to ignore U.S. employment law .\nThese actions , combined with President Biden \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigrants to try their luck in 2021 .\nThat is certainly the message drug cartels and migrant-smuggling \u201c coyotes \u201d have taken to the people of Central America : Trump is gone , and Biden will let you in .\nIn February\u2014President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas \u2019 s very first full month in office\u2014apprehensions of illegal border-crossers jumped 28 percent to 100,000 .\nThe numbers kept surging month after month , even in the summer , when crossings traditionally dip due to the oppressive heat .\nBy the end of the federal fiscal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.7 million illegal aliens , an all-time record .\nMany were released into the interior of the country , awaiting court appearances that few will bother to attend .\nSecretary Mayorkas \u2019 s decisions have enriched Mexican cartels and smugglers , who \u2019 ve turned the effectively open border into a cash cow .\nThe illegal journey north can cost migrants $ 11,000 or more , on average .\nIn total , officials estimate that cartels are reaping hundreds of millions of dollars annually from effectively extorting these smuggling operations , forcing migrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn fact , these extortionate fees have prompted some migrants to band together in caravans , figuring that the cartels won \u2019 t attack such a large group , even if its members don \u2019 t pay for protection .\nIt \u2019 s a risky gamble .\nThose who fall behind their caravans are often abandoned and left for dead .\nMany drown in the Rio Grande trying to cross .\nWomen and children are routinely sexually assaulted .\nOn our side of the border , the humanitarian emergency continues to worsen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people are crammed with thousands , environments ripe for abuse and Covid outbreaks .\nIronically , officials have temporarily held unaccompanied children in pens while they

year .\nThey might call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syllabus .\nBut banning sounds more evil because it instantly summons up the Hitler comparisons progressives so dearly love .\nExpect someone on Twitter to call McMinn \u2019 s city hall the Reichstag before the week is over .\nIn progressive poker , nothing beats Nazi .\nThe real issue is always why a specific book is left out of a curriculum , because that reveals the true agenda .\nOf the top 10 \u201c banned \u201d books , progressive definitions of racism and the use of the n-word are the reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , To Kill a Mockingbird , Of Mice and Men , One Flew Over the Cuckoo \u2019 s Nest , and Lord of the Flies .\nMost of the other common bans deal with old-timey norms about sexuality and profanity , such as in The Color Purple , and those books usually just migrate up a few grade levels to take care of that .\nSome on the McMinn school board even suggested Maus might work in an upper grade ( no one in McMinn is denying the Holocaust or demanding the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking seems a tad more thoughtful than progressives throwing away a classic tale with a lot to say just because of the antiquated way Huck refers to his black friend .\nSo what is the problem with Maus in Tennessee ?\nAccording to the school board , the book contained curse words and a depiction of a naked character .\nIt does seem that strikes pretty close to the same reasons progressive schools ban Huck Finn , only the words and images are , you know , different .\nOf course progressives don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee when they say they object to words , knowing for sure those red necked inbred country cousins are , at their empty hearts , anti-Semites .\nNobody with an Oberlin degree wants to say a Nazi using the word kike to show Aryan superiority is anywhere close to Piggy in Lord of the Flies , representing British imperialism , using the n-word to refer to savages as a show of white superiority .\nThey also don \u2019 t want to talk about why we can write kike instead of \u201c the k-word.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools banning Lord of the Flies are even now adding Maus to their curricula .\nThey have the intellectual depth of a touring company of CATS .\nPeople in McMinn County seem to take their education seriously .\nTheir list of approved textbooks is posted online , though not the novels read in lit classes .\nAmerican history is taught around standard history omnibus editions from controversy-avoidance educational publishers McGraw and Pearson .\nThe county is predominantly white and Baptist , something of a sin itself these days , and has exactly zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFisher Public Library has multiple copies of Maus available .\nSo for all the knuckleheads on social media setting up GoFundMe \u2019 s to flood copies of Maus into McMinn , relax , it \u2019 s already there ( imagine some conservative group papering Loudon County with Huck Finn ) .\nIn fact , the McMinn library has multiple copies of all of the books most banned in American schools .\nThey do not have a copy of Protocols of the Elders of Zion , however .\nThe progressive lust for banning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction .\nProgressives have been running a campaign against Abigail Shrier \u2019 s Irreversible Damage : The Transgender Craze Seducing our Daughters .\n\u201c Stopping the circulation of this book and these ideas is 100 percent a hill I will die on , \u201d tweeted ACLU \u2019 s Chase Strangio .\nAnd when Joe Rogan hosted Shrier to discuss the book , employees at Spotify demanded it take the interview off its platform .\nWhen the classic To Kill a Mockingbird and other books about racial issues were banned from the curriculum in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.A. Times characterized it not as the work of a Nazi Sondereinsatzkommando but merely as a \u201c debate \u201d over how to teach anti-racism .\nThe same school also banned Huck Finn and Of Mice and Men for their racist content and use of the n-word .\nThe banned book action was draped around spurious claims a teenager learned the n-word from one of the now off-limits books before using it against another student .\nThey were also concerned that reading aloud a text written decades ago , a white teacher might utter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call the n-word .\nAs if rising to a hold my beer challenge , the New York Times allowed not a single comment in its online reporting about the Maus crisis supporting the school board \u2019 s decision .\nThey did allow comments such as \u201c It \u2019 s Tennessee .\nYou have to let them go .\nI know it \u2019 s hard , but red states are another country in most ways , \u201d \u201c Tennessee !\nWell what do you expect , they are lost somewhere in the 15th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids in Tennessee don \u2019 t read no good anyways .\nThe NYT also reminded readers McMinn County is just a short drive from Dayton , Tennessee , the site of the famous Scopes monkey trial , as if the two were somehow related in the greater hillbilly oeuvre .\nSo , the conclusion is both sides ban books , right ?\nIn progressive America if that results in Huck not being taught , earnest people embrace it as progress .\nTake the same blunt tool and point it at Maus and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those NPR supporters who want tolerance and anti-racism taught hate the fact that a white Baptist community even exists , and can not see past their own hypocrisy .\nTheir hate spirals from McMinn County bans a book to McMinn County are anti-Semites to McMinn County votes Republican to McMinn County will help re-elect Trump to McMinn County is modern day fascism and must be stopped by any means necessary .\nIt reeks of theocracy even though it sounds nice enough when phrased as \u201c choices that reflect our values.\n\u201d It \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others always is .\nNot a lot of self-reflection in Mein Kampf ; the Nazis were certain in their righteousness , too .\nAs with any challenge to free speech , the correct answer is always more free speech , not less .\nDo not ban words .\nDo not ban books .\nTeach people to understand context and to learn to recognize bad things not by hiding them but by exposing them .\nLet schoolchildren learn about hate , whether from Lord of the Flies or Maus .\nIf you are frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat .\nYou are .\nPeter Van

Times appealed to the Supreme Court , arguing that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracy of every criticism of a public official , freedom of the press would be severely limited .\nThe First Amendment , they argued , required the Court to give the benefit of the doubt to the media in cases involving public officials .\nThe Court sided with the Times , and created a new standard for libel of a public figure , \u201c actual malice , \u201d defined as knowing a statement was false but publishing it anyway , or publishing a claim with \u201c reckless disregard \u201d for truth .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Times has not lost a libel case in America ever since .\nAs part of the decision , Justice William Brennan asserted America \u2019 s \u201c profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited , robust , and wide-open.\n\u201d Free and open debate about the conduct of public officials , the Court reasoned , was more important than

that monetize anything that garners clicks.\n\u201d Gorsuch is clear : The changing media landscape requires the Court reassess Sullivan .\nNow , the Court has a conservative majority that might be

is Kevin Annett , a controversial defrocked United Church Minister , who has been disseminating the stories of Combes and others about the residential schools for about 25 years .\nOne of these stories , recounted by Annett , claimed that Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip took a group of students from the Kamloops Indian Residential School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then abducted them .\nThorough fact-checking has shown that the Royals did not even travel to Kamloops in 1964 .\nWhile the Queen Elizabeth abduction story probably would be regarded with skepticism by most , many similar improbable accounts of \u201c murders \u201d and \u201c missing children \u201d are being repeated by Tk \u2019 eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc \u201c Knowledge Keepers \u201d and are now accepted as

.\nThese stories were given additional momentum in May 2021 and are now firmly ensconced within the Canadian consciousness .\nUpon closer examination , the circulation of these stories has some similarities with the moral panic started by the book Michelle Remembers published in 1980 .\nThe case involved Michelle Smith , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made sweeping claims about the satanic ritual abuse that she claimed to have endured .\nThe book presented itself as being factual , but scrutiny of its contents did not corroborate its claims .\nThis did not prevent it from instigating a social contagion , leading to a satanic abuse moral panic in the 1980s that resulted in over 12,000 unsubstantiated accusations being made .\nThe hysteria eventually subsided , but not before a number of innocent people had their lives ruined .\nThe satanic abuse moral panic was made possible by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychology has shown that it is easy to manufacture memories , especially in people who are emotionally disturbed .\nThe most famous example of this was the McMartin preschool trial in 1983 .\nIn this case , the claims made about those accused of satanic abuse , Peggy McMartin and Ray Buckey , were eagerly and uncritically reported by the media .\nMichelle Smith and others identifying as \u201c survivors \u201d of satanic abuse also met with the complainants , and were thought to have influenced their allegations against McMartin and Buckey .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatically increased the incidence of remembered sexual abuse .\nPressure was used to obtain disclosures , since interviews rewarded testimonies about abuse and discouraged denials .\nSimilar cases of mass hysteria , in fact , have appeared periodically throughout history , from the Salem Witch Trials to the Hammersmith Ghost Hysteria .\nThe current accusations of \u201c Knowledge Keepers \u201d about \u201c secret burials \u201d at KIRS take on a similar flavor .\nFurthermore , it is important to point out that these allegations have resulted in the extraction of numerous forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enthusiastically promote them .\nAlthough it is widely recognized that the residential schools caused a great deal of harm , and serious injustices were committed against many members of the indigenous population , pretending to believe things that are highly unlikely to be true will do nothing to address the serious problems that we face .\nIf we are to accept that reconciliation can not occur without truth , wild accusations must be examined critically .\nIn order to develop evidence-based policy , we need to enter into honest discussions to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On October 18 , 2021 , Justin Trudeau , the prime minister of Canada , travelled to Kamloops to meet with the Tk \u2019 eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc ( formerly the Kamloops Indian Band ) with an \u201c Orange Shirt Day \u201d pin firmly and visibly fastened to his lapel .\nThe meeting was a strange sight , as the prime minister was being chastised openly by his hosts while sitting a few feet away from them for failing to attend their Truth and Reconciliation Day ceremony a few weeks before .\nThe day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Petition to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau from the Tk \u2019 eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc Family Heads \u201d was published in The Globe and Mail .\nThe open letter stated , \u201c In May of 2021 , evidence of a horrific act of genocide was laid bare to the world , with the confirmation of at least 215 unmarked graves of little ones who attended the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\u201d The petition demanded that \u201c real acts of reconciliation \u201d take place , including funds for DNA analysis , a permanent memorial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d guaranteed revenues for services , a recognition of indigenous rights and title , and \u201c reconciliation progress \u201d reporting .\nThe meeting and petition came about as the result of a long sequence of events that began with a press releaseannouncingthe \u201c confirmation of the remains of 215 children who were students of the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\u201d This announcement resulted in sensationalist media coverage that often referred to the discovery of a \u201c mass grave.\n\u201d The New York Times , for example , headlined its article \u201c \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indigenous Children Reported in Canada.\n\u201d \u201c An Indigenous community says it has found evidence that 215 children were buried on the grounds of a British Columbia school , \u201d the story says , adding that the remains \u201c included those of children as young as 3.\n\u201d And it was not just the media that made these claims .\nThere was an outpouring of grief and recriminations in universities .\nAt my ( now former ) employer , Mount Royal University , President Tim Rahilly stated , \u201c The discovery of 215 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the site of a former residential school in Kamloops is nothing short of devastating .\nMy heart goes out to everyone in our campus community feeling the impact of this discovery and the intergenerational trauma of residential schools.\n\u201d Rahilly recommended that we look at the statement of Dr. Linda Manyguns ( who had not yet started using lower case letters to express her opposition to oppression ) .\nManyguns offered her \u201c condolences and support to the Tk \u2019 eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc First Nations upon the discovery of the remains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the former Kamloops Indian Residential School , \u201d asserting , \u201c We must face the horror \u201d and \u201c commit to finding the others who went missing.\n\u201d The president of my faculty association also weighed in on the matter .\nHe stated that he \u201c was horrified by the discovery of the bodies of 215 children at Kamloops Residential School \u201d and that \u201c as President of the MRFA , I want to express my support and solidarity with our Indigenous colleagues , who are reeling from yet more evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent.\n\u201d One of these indigenous colleagues , Gabrielle Lindstrom , a former indigenous studies professor at MRU and now an educational development consultant in \u201c Indigenous Ways of Knowing \u201d at the University of Calgary , maintained on Twitter that \u201c 215 little ones \u201d had been \u201c murdered \u201d at KIRS .\nThis statement was supported by numerous MRU professors .\nOne colleague even argued a month later that \u201c the murders of \u2018 hundreds \u2019 ( thousands ? )\nof indigenous children in Canada \u2019 s catholic residential schools \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame [ d ] \u201d for the burning of churches .\nBecause such statements were widely supported across the country , with almost no critical analysis , one could be forgiven for thinking that the claims about the \u201c bodies of 215 children \u201d had been substantiated .\nThis is not the case .\nWhat will be shown below is that there is no evidence to support the existence of remains at KIRS , not to mention the extraordinary claim of 215 \u201c murders.\n\u201d In a similar manner to the satanic abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Billy Combes and others , after being widely disseminated , are likely to have been absorbed into the memories of Tk \u2019 eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc \u201c Knowledge Keepers \u201d and the wider public consciousness .\nThis has been facilitated by indigenous organizations intent on increasing compensation from the government , as well as \u201c woke \u201d academics , journalists , and politicians who assume that the indigenous \u201c genocide survivor \u201d identity must be accepted without question .\nWhat Is the Basis for These \u2018 Knowings \u2019 ?\nIn a May 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosanne Casimir stated , \u201c We had a knowing in our community that we were able to verify , \u201d and , \u201c To our knowledge , these missing children are undocumented deaths \u201d with some being \u201c as young as three years old.\n\u201d It turned out , however , that there was no verification .\nInstead , a July 15 , 2021 , presentation by Dr. Sarah Beaulieu , the academic who had undertaken the survey of the area , stated that burials had not been confirmed but \u201c targets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penetrating Radar ( GPR ) .\nDuring her presentation , Beaulieu cautioned that definitive statements about specific numbers , or even conclusions about the existence of any burials , could not be made until excavations were undertaken .\nDr. Beaulieu \u2019 s presentation was supplemented by another press release from the Tk \u2019 eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc .\nThis one noted that the survey was undertaken for three reasons : the oral histories of Knowledge Keepers had recollected \u201c children as young as 6 years old being woken in the night to dig holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; \u201c a juvenile rib bone \u201d had surfaced nearby ; and a \u201c juvenile tooth was excavated from a shovel test pit during an impact assessment conducted by Simon Fraser University \u2019 s archaeology department.\n\u201d It was maintained that while \u201c a juvenile tooth is not an indicator of loss of life , \u201d the other discovery of the \u201c juvenile rib bone \u201d meant that \u201c this possibility should not be discounted.\n\u201d Media coverage has noted that the existence of the rib bone and tooth was confirmed by Beaulieu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine where to search .\nWith respect to the rib bone , it was claimed to have been found by a tourist in the early 2000s .\nThe tourist evidently provided the bone to the band , and it was then \u201c identified as human.\n\u201d Other accounts maintain that the bone was \u201c found beneath the apple orchard \u201d and \u201c in the soil during another dig.\n\u201d As the source for the information about the rib bone was Dr. Beaulieu , I tried to contact her by email several times in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered .\nThis silence about the \u201c juvenile rib bone \u201d is troubling .\nGenerally , if a human bone is found , one does not just hand it over to an indigenous group .\nFinding human remains is a serious matter , and the police would need to investigate so as to determine the identity of the deceased person and if foul play had occurred .\nQuestions need to be answered as to whether or not the bone has been determined to be human .\nIf so , did the Tk \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigating this matter , and what were the results of the investigation ?\nAlthough the Simon Fraser University archaeology department \u2019 s response to an inquiry on July 27 , 2021 , did not provide any information about the rib bone , except to say that they believed that a \u201c community member \u201d had found it , they did shed some light on the claim about the tooth .\nIt was noted that this was identified as a possible human tooth in another dig by Dr. George Nicholas but had now been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beaulieu was not aware of this when she gave her presentation ) .\nIn response to attempts to get additional information about the tooth , the following reply was provided on July 28 , 2021 , by an archaeology department member : \u201c I have been strongly advised by the TteS legal team not to respond to any queries from the public regarding the search for unmarked graves in Kamloops.\n\u201d It was asserted that this request had been extended to include the entire archaeology department .\nAlthough it is impossible to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public university to make such statements , this could be due to the federal government \u2019 s Tri-Council Policy Statement : Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans ( TCPS2 ) .\nIn its chapter on \u201c Research Involving the First Nations , Inuit and M\u00e9tis Peoples of Canada , \u201d there is encouragement of \u201c respectful relationships \u201d and \u201c the \u201c ongoing efforts of Indigenous peoples to preserve and manage their collective knowledge and information generated from their communities.\n\u201d This close relationship between SFU and the Tk \u2019 eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ te Secwe\u0301pemcpartnered with Simon Fraser University \u2019 s Department of Archaeology from 1991 to 2005 .\nThis partnership excavated all over the reserve for development purposes , including an area that overlapped with Beaulieu \u2019 s GPR work .\nThis is why , when Beaulieu belatedly learned about the project after May 27 , she had to revise her estimate of 215 initial \u201c targets of interest \u201d down to 200 .\nThis revised number was relayed during her July 15 oral presentation , described below .\nThis revision is important because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not consider 15 \u201c targets of interest \u201d identified by Beaulieu as being \u201c probable burials.\n\u201d It is possible that the other 200 are similarly questionable .\nThe possibility of the politicization of the SFU archaeology department is disturbing .\nSimon Fraser University is a public institution , and its ability to discuss research findings should not be controlled by the Tk \u2019 eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc or any other private entity .\nIt also raises questions about whether the archaeological research undertaken about indigenous \u201c unmarked graves \u201d has been compromised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent are the claims of Dr. Beaulieu and the other archaeologists working for indigenous organizations , about their \u201c confidence \u201d in the probability of finding unmarked graves , valid ?\nTo make this determination , it is necessary to examine the degree of certainty provided by GPR .\nHow Much Certainty Is Provided by GPR ?\nOn July 15 , 2021 , the Tk \u2019 eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc hosted a public presentation and media event to present the findings of the Beaulieu GPR survey .\nThe event exuded a politically charged atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and references to the ancestors .\nChief Casimir spoke of the need to find the \u201c truth \u201d about the \u201c missing children\u2026 whose remains were placed in unmarked graves.\n\u201d She explained that \u201c we are not here for retaliation , we are here for truth telling \u201d so as to \u201c bring peace to those missing children , families , and communities.\n\u201d This would require \u201c follow [ ing ] the evidence and the science \u201d while \u201c pay [ ing ] heed to what oral tellings survivors share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this would take a great deal of time and resources and that \u201c cultural and wellness supports \u201d were available to help audience members deal with this \u201c historic dark chapter \u201d and the intergenerational trauma that it had created .\nBeaulieu had been selected to do the survey because of her professional interactions with Dr. Eldon Yellowhorn , an indigenous studies professor and past president of the Canadian Archaeological Association .\nBeaulieu gave her presentation on the report she had written about her use of GPR in what used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained that GPR was able to determine \u201c subsurface anomalies , \u201d many of which were now \u201c targets of interest.\n\u201d It was noted that oral histories had \u201c guided \u201d the use of GPR ; claims about children being woken in the middle of the night to dig clandestine graves , it was implied , were true , and GPR provided the \u201c special spatial specificity to this truth.\n\u201d While it was cautioned that the existence of remains could not be confirmed without excavation , a number of factors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely conclusion .\nBeaulieu pointed to the tooth and rib bone , \u201c depressions in the orchard that correlate with the subsurface anomalies , \u201d the \u201c east-west configuration of the subsurface anomalies \u201d consistent with \u201c typical Christian burial traditions , \u201d and most importantly the oral histories of the Knowledge Keepers .\nDuring her presentation , Beaulieu showed three slides of examples of the information that GPR had revealed .\nThese slides showed how the GPR image for a \u201c probable burial \u201d differed from the representation of metal object anomalies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEssentially , with burials , one could see the edge of the vertical shafts where digging had occurred , and the dome on top of it from the soil disturbance caused .\nIn her answer to a journalist from the Toronto Star , Beaulieu also stated that the \u201c probable burial \u201d anomalies were fairly shallow , between 0.7 and 0.8 metres below the surface , and this fit with the Knowledge Keepers \u2019 accounts of burying children and the fact that smaller bodies require less soil to be dug up .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ clandestine grave might differ from holes that were dug for other purposes .\nShe also did not mention how an image for a burial that was 50 to 70 years old ( the \u201c oral tellings \u201d had stated that KIRS burials had occurred in the 1950s and 1960s ) would differ from ones that were more recent .\nBeaulieu \u2019 s presentation was followed by remarks from Dr. Lisa Hodgetts , president of the Canadian Archaeological Association , and Dr. Kisha Supernant , an archaeologist from the University of Alberta .\nHodgetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settler , \u201d stated that she was grateful to the Tk \u2019 eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc for allowing her to \u201c bear witness \u201d to the \u201c pain and trauma \u201d being suffered by \u201c intergenerational survivors.\n\u201d She encouraged all Canadians to hold governments and the churches accountable for the \u201c thousands and thousands of missing children , \u201d asserting that funding should be provided to indigenous groups to \u201c chart their own path and own pace \u201d for further collaborative and respectful work to \u201c find missing children.\n\u201d Supernant , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Group on Unmarked Graves and director of the Institute of Prairie and Indigenous Archaeology , stressed the need to work collaboratively and respectfully with indigenous communities .\nSupernant commended Beaulieu \u2019 s work , confirmed that there were a \u201c number of highly probable burials , \u201d and referred to the \u201c knowledge held in communities by knowledge keepers.\n\u201d Again the need for more resources to undertake this work was stressed .\nThese presentations by archaeologists were followed by comments from RoseAnne Archibald , the Grand Chief of the Assembly of First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KIRS students and Knowledge Keepers , Evelyn Camille , Leona Thomas , and Mona Jules .\nAlthough all talked about the destruction of culture and self-esteem caused by the schools , only Camille discussed the \u201c missing children.\n\u201d Camille asserted that many children died from trying to cross the river and freezing to death when trying to make their way back home .\nShe believed that many children had been \u201c murdered \u201d but that the \u201c remains should be left undisturbed.\n\u201d Instead of excavating , Camille recommended \u201c say [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are found \u201d as this would \u201c guide them home to finish their journey.\n\u201d Grand Chief Archibald , after hearing these remarks , maintained that the Tk \u2019 eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc case had enabled the world to learn \u201c how 215 innocent children died and were buried in unmarked graves \u201d and that this \u201c crime against humanity \u201d constituted \u201c genocide.\n\u201d She completely ignored the caution expressed by Beaulieu and the other archaeologists and argued that \u201c this ground penetrating technology is revealing evidence , undisputable proof , that crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these \u201c probable burials , \u201d Archibald argued that the \u201c crimes have to be investigated \u201d and \u201c the criminals must be held to account.\n\u201d In \u201c looking for ways to heal the trauma , \u201d Archibald recommended that Canadians call politicians to demand \u201c reparations , \u201d \u201c justice , \u201d and \u201c action.\n\u201d Similar comments were made by Don Worme , the legal counsel for the Tk \u2019 eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc .\nAccording to Worme , \u201c I think what we can say firstly is that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no question that there have been children gone missing .\nOur knowledge keepers from this community have told us so .\nWe believe them.\n\u201d These comments by Worme and Archibald show an astounding disregard for Beaulieu \u2019 s tentativeness\u2014that remains can not be established until excavations are completed .\nEven worse , it appears that excavations will never be done because it is to be a \u201c community driven process , \u201d and many argue that the \u201c bodies \u201d should not be disturbed .\nThis raises questions about why people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d \u201c genocide , \u201d and \u201c atrocities \u201d occurred would not demand that forensic examinations be undertaken .\nIf \u201c the criminals must be held to account , \u201d as Archibald asserts , isn \u2019 t the first step in this process to determine whether or not the \u201c probable burials \u201d actually contain the remains of indigenous children ?\nOr is the intent to convict people of \u201c murder \u201d on the basis of the \u201c oral tellings \u201d of the \u201c Knowledge Keepers \u201d ?\nTime and time again one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to \u201c confirm \u201d the existence of children \u2019 s remains .\nThe burials in question would be over 50 years old , when it is recognized that there are \u201c limitations of detecting graves for extended postmortem intervals.\n\u201d One scientific paper in Naturemaintains , in fact , \u201c Finding hidden bodies , believed to have been murdered and buried , is problematic , expensive in terms of human resource and currently has low success rates for law enforcement agencies.\n\u201d It points out that \u201c there is a general reduction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since burial , so the sooner geophysical surveys can be undertaken the greater the chance of discovery.\n\u201d This means that it will be more difficult to see indications of graves the longer bodies have been in the ground .\nDetection will be particularly difficult if bodies are buried without a covering ; clandestine burials with unwrapped bodies are difficult to detect after ten years have elapsed .\nIt also is irresponsible not to point out that burials , even if they are \u201c probable , \u201d do not necessarily involve human remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertaken on the basis of GPR , there are many instances of the investigations finding other materials that are buried .\nIn the case of the search for three boys who went missing in 1966 from South Australia , for example , a \u201c subsurface anomaly that was consistent with the size , shape and depth of a burial that could have contained three small children \u201d was found , but this turned out to be animal bones and garbage .\nTherefore , it seems unlikely that Dr. Beaulieu would be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d involving the 215 ( and then 200 ) \u201c targets of interest \u201d after a period of 50 to 70 years had elapsed .\nAs there has been a refusal to release her report , there is no way for the findings to be scrutinized by objective observers .\nThe \u2018 Tellings \u2019 of the \u2018 Knowledge Keepers \u2019 As was mentioned above , the Tk \u2019 eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc press release on July 15 , 2021 , stated that Knowledge Keepers recall \u201c children as young as 6 years old being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for burials in the apple orchard.\n\u201d But who are these \u201c Knowledge Keepers , \u201d and how reliable are their recollections ?\nDo the recollections concern hearsay , or are they eyewitness accounts ?\nTo what extent have they been influenced by the stories that have been circulating for years in testimonies like those found in the film Unrepentant ?\nEven the use of the description \u201c Knowledge Keeper \u201d should be disputed , as knowledge claims must be constantly challenged on the basis of the evidence available .\nWhat does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept \u201d ?\nChief Casimir has never identified the Knowledge Keepers , nor has she specified what was said in their oral histories beyond what was asserted in the July press release .\nIt is possible that the names of the Knowledge Keepers are in Dr. Beaulieu \u2019 s written report , but Chief Casimir has refused to release it .\nFour women are identified as Knowledge Keepers on the Qwelm\u00ednte Secwepemc website : Colleen Seymour , Jeanette Jules , Mona Jules , and Rhona Bowe .\nIt also appears that some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they could have influenced the accounts of one another .\nThis would impact their reliability .\nIn looking at the oral histories about secret burials at KIRS , the first eyewitness account of burials is claimed , by Kevin Annett , to have been made in 1998 ( a search for earlier testimonies has found no reference to murders or secret burials ) .\nAnnett asserts that Jessie ( sometimes spelled Jesse ) Jules made these allegations when he spoke at a United Nations\u2013affiliated International Human Rights Association of American Minorities tribunal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which wasorganized \u201c to investigate genocide in Canadian Indian schools \u201d ( the \u201c Judicial Findings \u201d from this tribunal can be found online ) .\nAccording to Annett , even though Jules feared that he would be punished by his home reserve if he \u201c mentioned the dead kids , \u201d he told the tribunal that In addition to having the first account of \u201c buried children \u201d at KIRS attributed to him , Jules is significant because of an alleged connection to Billy Combes ( the footage of whom in Unrepentant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burials at KIRS ) .\nOn page 95 of his book Fallen : The Story of the Vancouver Four ( 2017 ) , Annett claims that Combes wrote a poem stating that his friend Jessie witnessed a secret burial with him .\nCombes is also quoted by Annett in the 2010 version of Hidden From History : The Canadian Genocide as stating the following : \u201c A friend of mine and I were out scavenging for food , since they never fed us regular .\nWe saw Brother Murphy dragging this bag towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned it over and a small body fell into the hole , and he started throwing the dirt in.\n\u201d Combes also claimed , in Annett \u2019 s account , to have witnessed Brother Murphy killing a child by throwing her off a balcony , as well as him burying a child in the apple orchard with another priest .\nAs the clearly fictional claim regarding Queen Elizabeth abducting children indicates , however , one needs to be skeptical about the accounts Annett relays .\nThe stories Annett attributes to Combes arenot even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Globe and Mail in 2007 .\nIt is also not known if these stories had any direct influence over the KIRS Knowledge Keepers .\nQuestions must be asked about how much the circulation of these grisly tales over social media and other fora has influenced the memories of those who attended KIRS .\nThere is only one early account\u2014in the book Behind Closed Doors , which was published in 2000\u2014that has appeared independently of Annett \u2019 s claims .\nIn this book , Eddy Jules , presumably related to Jessie/Jesse Jules , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something untoward at KIRS , but this was hearsay and did not mention the apple orchard .\nIn an account written up in the book on page 63 , Eddy Jules states the following : This hearsay changed substantially when Eddy Jules was interviewed by Morgan Hampton twenty years later on September 30 , 2021 .\nUnlike the account in Behind Closed Doors , Jules now claims to be an eyewitness to an event where he went into the medical room and saw \u201c blood all over the floor.\n\u201d According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have seen the janitor throwing a fetus into the furnace .\nWith respect to the secret burials , Hampton notes that Jules and other attendees had alluded to them for years , even though this was not mentioned in Behind Closed Doors .\nEddy Jules now asserts that he was 11 years old when he saw a light in the apple orchard in the middle of the night .\nHe also recounts that a student with a cleft palate was going to have an operation , but \u201c years later we found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he pissed some guy off at the Residential School that didn \u2019 t like the way he sounded.\n\u201d Apart from the interconnected testimonies of Billy Combes and Jessie/Jesse Jules , as well as this recently changed memory of Eddy Jules , there are no eyewitness accounts related to murders or burials.Dr .\nRonald Ignace ( who is related to Mona Jules ) , for example , said absolutely nothing about burials in his lengthy account of KIRS in Behind Closed Doors .\nOn June 5 , 2021 , in a Toronto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know all about them .\nHe recounted that , when he was a student at KIRS in the 1950s and 1960s , he had heard stories \u201c for years \u201d about students who were directed by staff to \u201c dig some holes \u201d in the middle of the night so that apple trees could be planted , and it was wondered why these plantings never occurred .\nAlthough Ignace , who has a PhD in anthropology , had no firsthand knowledge of burials , Chief Casimir \u2019 s announcement of Beaulieu \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that remains must have been found in the apple orchard .\nThis caused Ignace , when he visited the surveyed site , to go up to one of the 200/215 stakes and make an offering of tobacco and say a prayer .\nObserving these stakes led him to conclude the following : \u201c It \u2019 s heartbreaking to see all of our people surreptitiously buried in the dark of night in shallow graves.\n\u201d According to Ignace , \u201c It \u2019 s mind-boggling how they could\u2026do something as evil as that.\n\u201d Mona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also did not mention any secret burials in Behind Closed Doors ( although she was interviewed anonymously , identification can be determined when she talks about the death of her sister , Nellie , at KIRS ) .\nOn July 15 , 2021 , however , Mona Jules made the following remark : \u201c In doing my research about the residential school and the death of those children , back in the 1500s , the Pope had ordered the death of children that were gathered up and put in those schools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill them .\nThat was a cold , terrible command , coming from someone in a high position.\n\u201d Mona Jules had forgotten the title of the document from which she obtained this information , but maintained that it had the words \u201c field study \u201d in it .\nShe then went on to state that \u201c after hearing about those children , children being found along the orchards and other places , I often wondered what would have happened if I hadn \u2019 t been able to say my night prayers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been snuffed out because I wasn \u2019 t Catholic ?\n\u201d Mona Jules is identified as one of Tk \u2019 eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc \u201c Knowledge Keepers.\n\u201d Another former student , Mary Percival , also now claims that she heard about the burials .\nWhile Percival didn \u2019 t mention burials during her testimony at the TRC hearings in 2014 , her recollection in 2021 was that students were told to stay away from the apple orchard because it was claimed \u201c that children who died after running away from the school were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Percival asserts that she often picked apples and played in the orchard .\nBut if the apple orchard was levelled in 1962 or 1963 to build the new dormitory/hostel ( now the Band Administration building ) , as Celia Haig-Brown says it was in Resistance and Renewal , then how could Percival , who only arrived at KIRS in 1962 , have spent time playing in the orchard with other children and eating apples ?\nEven more of these kinds of stories have emerged with the airing of the Fifth Estate episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tk \u2019 eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc \u201d on January 13 , 2022 .\nIn this program , nine indigenous people connected to KIRS are interviewed\u2014Harvey McLeod , Norman Retasket , Diena Jules , Jennifer Yvonne Camille , Michael LeBourdais , Audrey Baptiste , Ted Gottfriedson , Rosanne Casimir , and Manny Jules\u2014and it is claimed that the residential school \u201c was a place of horror for the children forced to live here.\n\u201d Only two eyewitness accounts are provided .\nAudrey Baptiste states that she saw four boys hanging in a barn , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for class the next day .\nJennifer Yvonne Camille mentions seeing a coat hanger and blood in the furnace room .\nAll the references to burials concern hearing stories about holes being dug , unnamed people going missing , and being warned not to go near the apple orchard .\nAlthough this program supposedly prides itself on \u201c in-depth investigations , \u201d no critical questions are asked .\nThe tone and interview style indicate that all stories should be believed .\nThe most surprising circumstance is that a CBC piece associated with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a baby being thrown into a furnace .\nAccording to Harvey McLeod , he was approached by a man who claimed to have done this after hearing about the \u201c discovery of the suspected unmarked graves.\n\u201d According to McLeod , this man confessed that \u201c he was given a box to put in [ the furnace ] .\nHe didn \u2019 t know what it was and then he was going to put it in there , and a baby fell out.\n\u201d Even more strange is the fact , noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TRC chair Murray Sinclair issued a statement on June 1 , 2021 , on his facebook , after the discovery at the Kamloops Indian Residential School .\nHe says that survivors shared stories about the furnace to the TRC.\n\u201d According to Sinclair , \u201c Some of the survivors talked about infants who were born to young girls at the residential schools who had been fathered by priests , having those infants taken away from them and deliberately killed , sometimes by being thrown into furnaces , they told us.\n\u201d None of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published in the TRC reports .\nIf the TRC thought that this had occurred , surely judges like Sinclair would have thought it necessary to bring it to the attention of law enforcement .\nThe omission seems to indicate that the stories were not seen as being credible at the time , as they smacked of the kinds of improbable claims being disseminated by Kevin Annett .\nIt is shocking that what were once considered to be lurid tales attributed to a conspiracy theorist are now being credulously retold by Canada \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major inconsistency is revealed in the Fifth Estate episode , which should make everyone take pause .\nIt is now claimed that the search for the unmarked graves did not occur because of the recollections of the Knowledge Keepers or from finding a juvenile rib bone and tooth , as was stated in the July 15 Tk \u2019 eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc press release .\nInstead , it was museum administrator Diena Jules who was the \u201c driving force \u201d behind the effort to find the unmarked graves .\nShe initiated the search because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 to upgrade the community \u2019 s Heritage Park .\nBecause Covid-19 meant that some of the money could not be spent , Jules suggested that the band should use the funds to \u201c look for the kids \u201d because she wanted , for her own comfort , \u201c to confirm where they are.\n\u201d The fact that the story has changed so much in only a few months is another indication of the questionable nature of this narrative .\nIf the \u201c truth \u201d is really desired , what is needed is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims must be fact-checked and scrutinized alongside other forms of evidence .\nOther circumstances that cast doubt on these testimonies are that there were three indigenous teachers on staff at KIRS during the 1950s and 1960s : Joe Stanley Michel ( now deceased ) , Benjamin Paul , and Mabel Caron ( still living in Kamloops ) .\nThese three indigenous staff members are featured in the 1962 CBC documentary The Eyes of Children ( now considered , without explanation , to be a \u201c propaganda film \u201d by The Fifth Estate ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KIRS graduate in 1950 ( register # 589 ) and returned to KIRS to teach there from 1953 to 1967 and lived with his wife , Anna Susan Soulle ( also a KIRS graduate , register # 666 ) , and young family in a teacherage next door to the school building .\nMichel and Soulle were also interviewed in Celia Haig-Brown \u2019 s Resistance and Renewal ( 1988 ) , and did not mention burials .\nWould all of these indigenous people have kept silent about these alleged clandestine graves ?\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the macabre tales being told : footage of children enthusiastically crowding around one of the priests , playing sports , and being taught dancing by a nun .\nThree indigenous teachers , Michel , Paul , and Caron , can be observed giving classes and providing training in a machine shop .\nWhile one can be taken aback by the piousness of some of the scenes , and perhaps argue that the footage was sanitized to exaggerate the happiness of the children , it is hard to believe that the children in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their babies thrown into a furnace .\nBesides , is it really plausible to suggest that 215 or 200 children are \u201c missing \u201d when their names are unknown and there are no family members looking for them ?\nHow could so many children have been \u201c murdered \u201d in residential schools when no killers have been identified ?\nAs Hymie Rubenstein has pointed out , there is \u201c not a single known victim , not a single identified murderer , not a single grieving parent looking for a child who went missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a single body.\n\u201d The questionable nature of the evidence for assuming that there are 215 or 200 secret burials in an apple orchard\u2014a likely nonexistent juvenile rib bone , a report of GPR that will not be released and can not even be discussed by the SFU archaeology department , and the highly questionable memories of people who have been made aware of the stories being circulated in various fora\u2014makes one wonder why this narrative has gained so much currency in universities and media outlets across the country .\nWith respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained by what I have called \u201c neotribal rentierism , \u201d where compensation is extracted for wrongs that have been committed in the past .\nThis rent-seeking has been assisted by \u201c woke \u201d non-indigenous academics who assume that , to combat oppression , they must \u201c shut up and listen \u201d and unquestionably accept the indigenous \u201c genocide survivor \u201d identity .\nIn The Globe and Mail on October 25 , 2021 , it is stated that \u201c two human-rights-tribunal orders that would result in billions of dollars in compensation for Indigenous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d in the context of \u201c the Liberal government \u2019 s commitment to reconciliation.\n\u201d There is reference to a \u201c legal battle \u201d taking place and that this is occurring while \u201c the issue of reconciliation with Indigenous peoples has come into greater focus for the country with the revelations of unmarked burial sites of former residential school students.\n\u201d As was seen in the Tk \u2019 eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc \u2019 s open letter , referred to at the beginning of this piece , this is just one area of funding that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u201c unmarked burial sites.\n\u201d It is part of wider rent-seeking efforts that rely upon characterizing Canada as a perpetrator of genocide .\nThe problem of trying to get to the truth of the \u201c secret burials \u201d is made worse by the fact that archaeologists are becoming increasingly concerned about their relationships with indigenous organizations .\nWe are told that the three hundred million dollars that has now been released to \u201c search \u201d for these \u201c secret burials \u201d must be \u201c community led , \u201d requiring that they conform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis was seen in the connection between the Tk \u2019 eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc and the SFU archaeology department discussed earlier .\nBecause of some undetermined connection , presumably due to a constraint from a funding arrangement or the desire to develop \u201c respectful relationships , \u201d the Department of Archaeology at SFU has decided that it should not publicly discuss the findings about the unmarked graves .\nThese constraints on academic discussion do not just pertain to the discipline of archaeology .\nIt is linked to wider developments in the academy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by what Helen Pluckrose and James Lindsay call \u201c reified postmodernism , \u201d known colloquially as \u201c wokeism.\n\u201d According to Pluckrose and Lindsay , postmodernism was originally a relativist framework that focused on subjectivity in opposition to objectivity so as to contest the Enlightenment \u2019 s promotion of science , reason , and the pursuit of a universal truth .\nIts ability to disarm the academy , however , meant that postmodernism gradually became \u201c reified , \u201d leading to the aggressive demands that identities perceived to be oppressed be \u201c made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Knowledge Keepers \u2019 tellings \u201d and other testimonies about the \u201c 215 secret burials \u201d in the apple orchard at KIRS , the identity that must be made real is the notion of being an indigenous residential school ( genocide ) \u201c survivor.\n\u201d This is why there were so many uncritically accepted references to \u201c mass graves , \u201d \u201c denialism , \u201d and \u201c murdered \u201d children in universities across the country .\nIf one questions the claim that the residential schools were genocidal , or argues that they provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserted by one \u2019 s colleagues that this is tantamount to being a Holocaust denier .\nAnd just as teaching that the Holocaust did not occur would likely result in dismissal for academic incompetence , some professors claim that one should be fired for challenging the residential schools ( genocide ) \u201c survivor \u201d identity .\nThe university \u2019 s widespread promotion of \u201c decolonization \u201d and \u201c reconciliation \u201d is now morphing into demands for affirmative acknowledgments from professors , as some indigenous students , faculty , and staff claim that being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture of fear \u201d and challenging the \u201c genocide \u201d narrative \u201c conveys a tolerance for violent and lethal behaviour.\n\u201d While these kinds of intellectual constraints around the discussions of cases like KIRS are destructive for academic freedom and open inquiry , a more disturbing consequence is the impact that this is having on indigenous peoples themselves .\nThe acceptance of these lurid and highly improbable stories is causing increasing anger and bitterness about the past , as well as an inability to communicate , when what is needed are honest conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health , and housing problems facing indigenous communities .\nAs has been said many times , there can be no \u201c reconciliation \u201d without truth .\nBecause of the accusations of \u201c genocide \u201d that have emerged with the moral panic brought about by the circulation of stories about \u201c secret burials , \u201d \u201c murders , \u201d and \u201c mass graves , \u201d the actual problems facing marginalized indigenous people are not being addressed .\nWe are , once again , heading down a path where funds will be dispersed to alleviate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of money .\nAs Evelyn Camille pointed out in her statement at the July 15 , 2021 , public presentation about the Beaulieu report , the residential school settlement of billions of dollars is just perceived as \u201c [ throwing ] a few silver coins \u201d at indigenous people instead of actually addressing their suffering .\nMuch indigenous deprivation\u2014low educational levels , poor health , and high rates of violent criminality , alcoholism , sexual abuse , and suicide\u2014is due to being economically isolated and receiving substandard services , especially a poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rectified by spending billions of dollars on the allegations about \u201c unmarked graves.\n\u201d This only benefits a tiny elite of indigenous and non-indigenous rent-seekers to the detriment of ordinary indigenous people .\nMoney will be paid out to lawyers and consultants in what Albert Howard and I have called the Aboriginal Industry , and new grievances will ensure that funds are diverted to complex agreements and bureaucratic processes that benefit no one .\nPortraying the residential schools as \u201c genocidal \u201d is at best a distraction ; at worst , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that face any nation-state trying to incorporate isolated and marginalized tribal cultures into a modern economy and society .\nFrances Widdowson was an Associate Professor , in the Department of Economics , Justice , and Policy Studies at Mount

"content": "\u201c Appeasement , \u201d \u201c Munich , \u201d and the years of 1938-9 retain immense rhetorical power when invoked by political and media actors in the English-speaking world .\nIn the media landscape , foreign policy pundits often insinuate that to negotiate with rivals is to risk repeating the mistakes of Neville Chamberlain , the pre-World War II British Prime Minister who is said to have \u201c given away \u201d a part of Czechoslovakia in exchange for \u201c peace inour time.\n\u201d Subsequent events cast the phrase into infamy .\nPutting aside the fact that Chamberlain \u2019 s diplomacy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and served the sound strategic purpose ofbuying time for Britishrearmamentto achieve a stronger position against Germany , the characterization of the British prime minister as a hapless dupe playing into Hitler \u2019 s hands in the na\u00efve hope of avoiding inevitable conflict has lived on in the popular imagination ever since .\nThe specter of \u201c appeasement \u201d has most recently been invoked by thosecritical of the Biden administration for being insufficiently confrontational in response to Russian actions in Ukraine .\nSenators Tom Cottonand Joni Ernst have led the charge in weaponizing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bipartisan tradition .\nInfluenced by the ( nowlargely debunked ) \u201c Russiagate \u201d scandal , Democratic politicians and affiliated journalists once hurled the same accusationat the Trump administration for its alleged failure to be sufficiently hawkish in Syria or Ukraine .\nA CNN contributor even referred to the Trump-Putin meeting in Helsinki as a \u201c surrender summit.\n\u201d Such commentary is baked into the foreign policy consensus in Washington and goes beyond the establishment \u2019 s hatred of Trump .\nIn 2012 , President Obama had to deflect criticism from electoral challenger Mitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russian threat seriously enough .\nObama also faced one of the most bizarre rounds of criticismfor his willingness to negotiate with Iran , and was called \u201c an appeaser like Neville Chamberlain \u201d by a conservative commentator who then could not explain who Chamberlain even was or why the example was historically pertinent to Obama \u2019 s convening nuclear talks with Tehran .\nTogether , these bellicose accusations point to a greater culture of using and abusing Second World War analogies for every contemporary geopolitical problem .\nBe it comparing new rivals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat of global total war , or casting all rivalries as existential and ideological zero-sum contests , the Second World War looms large in the imagination of the foreign policy commentariat in the North Atlantic .\nIn a sense , this should not surprise .\nA majority of the world \u2019 s population lives in countries that benefited from Allied victory .\nThe rapid expansion and subsequent brutality enacted by Germany , Japan , and Italy on much of the world was that of militant revisionist powers\u2014countries seeking to upset the post-WWI order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Washington Naval Treaty , and the Kellogg-Briand Pact .\nPerhaps more pertinently , most adults alive today grew up with elders who directly experienced and suffered during the war era and who , if willing to speak about it at all , had harrowing accounts of what those times were like .\nThe fear that such a time of global strife could return is ever-present , as is the pride of personally knowing people who survived the crisis .\nI sympathize with this perspective , as someone partially descended from Japanese immigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pacific Theater .\nMy grandmother , then still a child , survived \u201c OperationMeetinghouse , \u201d the concentrated firebombing of Tokyo .\nLargely regarded as the deadliest air raid in history , Operation Meetinghouse was estimated to have caused 100,000 deaths and rendered over a million people homeless .\nIts effectiveness can be attributed to the bombers \u2019 low-level altitude , which increased accuracy , as well as the use of incendiary munitions to wreak maximum damage on the then-largely wooden city .\nOnly in the later years of her life would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of the night she lost half of her immediate relatives in a matter of hours ; how she and some of her siblings , hating the smell of the densely packed crowds that filled air-raid shelters , had decided to go above ground rather than stay underground during the raid ; how this impulsive decision had spared their lives when the civilian shelter was directly hit in the bombardment , killing everyone inside .\nBut her tragic odyssey had only just begun .\nShe then had to navigate a post-apocalyptic Tokyo with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPeople ran towards the river for relief from the ever-present flames , only to find the water filled with charred-black and withered bodies ; napalm-based accelerants could not be doused with water alone , causing many who threw themselves into the water to nevertheless perish in flames .\nIn the midst of this chaos , famine and disease soon descended upon the city , taking a further toll on the survivors .\nThe post-raid casualties included additional relatives .\nThe nightmare would last until the American occupation of Japan brought an end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militarist government that had caused it , but the supply shortages that reverberated as aftershocks in its wake .\nThis is just one particularly tragic example of many that illustrate the trans-generational impact of the Second World War , and it helps to explain the evocative power of the time period .\nBut it also explains how distorting and misleading this invocation can be : The Second World War was not the only devastating conflict to occur in modern history , nor is it necessarily the one most germane to the present moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected to it more than most , but the world we inhabit today is not that of the late 1930sand early 1940s .\nBy elevating the Second World War to a privileged place in the hierarchies of our historical analogies , we also ignore\u2014in our indignant , sanctimonious moralism as victors\u2014much of the conflict \u2019 s original complexity and moral ambiguity .\nWe brush aside the inconvenient context of colonialism , imperialism , and national humiliation and we ignore the prevailing geopolitical considerations of the period .\nFinland and Thailand , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Axis due to preexisting territorial disputes with the Soviet Union and the British Empire , respectively .\nAnd Iran , a country effectively torn at the seams by both Moscow and London , suffered invasion and occupation despite its ostensible neutrality in the war .\nThese countries and others could make a case complicating claims of the universal moral righteousness of the war .\nMany in India make the argument that Churchill was India \u2019 s Hitler given that the Bengal Famine was largely the result of British imperial policy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of manysuch eventsin almost two centuries of British misrule in South Asia , a context that makes the Hitler-admiring Japanese collaborator Subhas Chandra Boselook far more morally complicated than can first be assumed .\nSimilar reasons explain the fact that popular opinion in America wasagainst direct U.S. involvement in the war before the attack on Pearl Harbor .\nHistorical analogies are always imperfect , of course .\nBut the all-or-nothing approach of seeing everything through the lens of a single simplified and totalizing conflict is unhelpful .\nWhile it may explain certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the existence of the United Nations , its Security Council , and the decolonization of old European empires , it fails to shed light on our present moment .\nIn fact , its routine usage by hawks suggests it is intended to sabotage nuanced discussion about complex geopolitical crises and foment more conflict .\nFocusing on World War II has the effect of obscuring the fact that the formation of a \u201c postwar era \u201d order is not unique to our time .\nThe Thirty Years \u2019 War of the mid-17th Century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central Europe had faced to that time and led to the rise of the Westphalianstate system , which , for a time , reduced the number of conflicts in Europe and sidelined sectarianism .\nThe French Revolution and subsequent Napoleonic Wars involved mass mobilization , the scouring of entire countries , and a global dimension .\nIt would culminate in a \u201c Concert of Europe , \u201d which also served to temporarily reduce tensions between the previously warring great powers ( even while exporting conflict abroad to European colonies ) .\nHistory is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to new orders , which then decay over time , leading to instability and an imperfect repeat of the process .\nScholars from Sima Qianin ancient China toIbn Khaldunin North Africa of the late Middle Ages have noticed similar cyclical patterns .\nThese observations call into question the validity of an obsessive focus on a single specific era at the expense of all others .\nWith the fading of the \u201c American Moment , \u201d we are witnessing a rise in multi-polarity with more and more states able to wield power independently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , a sounder historical analogy and a better model to make sense of the dangers we face would be the First World War , not the Second .\nIn the run-up to the Great War , it was Britain that was losing its previously unchallenged hegemonic position .\nAs the balance of power changed , states seeking realignment created hair-trigger alliance systems\u2014where a single peripheral conflict , like the \u201c July Crisis \u201d between Serbia and Austria-Hungary\u2014could drag the entire planet into a world war .\nAs we see in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joining the blob to falsely declare Kiev a \u201c U.S .\nally \u201d \u2014the temptation for major powers to make foolhardy proclamations in disputes peripheral to their core interests is everlasting .\nThe reason foreign policy elites and North Atlantic societies in general fixate on the Second World War and its associated narratives of courage and resistance is that such arguments , made with a dose of moralism , serves the compulsion to war felt by many English-speaking elites .\nIf it is the goal of Western policymakers to avoid a catastrophic conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nuclear weapons , to boot ) and protect what remains of the post-1945 order , they would be wise to avoid over-expanding alliance networks that lock more countries into stark binaries in foreign policy .\nThis is especially true when those countries , like Ukraine , are distant from the core interests of the United States ( the key actor in NATO ) and tangential to a stable balance of power among great powers .\nIt is not \u201c appeasement \u201d to recognize the facts on the ground and recalibrate to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is a simple acknowledgement that when multiple countries have competing interests , the issue is best resolved with each nation making a sober calculation of its respective national-security priorities .\nDiplomacy must come first .\nBy allowing an obsession with the shadows of 1938-9 to blind us to our present reality , we risk the far-more-likely scenario of stumbling into something reminiscent of another July Crisis .\nChristopher Mott is a Research Fellow at the Institute for Peace & Diplomacy .\nDr. Mott is an international

culture war \u201d arguments from the GOP .\nAs far as I can tell by \u201c culture war , \u201d they do not have in mind issues such as abortion or ( remember when ? )\nprayer in public schools , but a somewhat looser grouping of enmities and half-formed resentments .\nThe bottom line is that Republicans want to portray their opponents as out-of-touch , hypocritical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dupes of facile quasi-religious manias , and all-around haters of fun .\nThey \u2019 re probably right about all of these things .\nI fully expect Democrats to lose ground in the House and the Senate ; in fact , Republicans gaining control of both chambers next year is not an absurd hypothetical .\nBut the reasons why are worth considering .\nThe amazing thing about the new culture wars\u2014in which I \u2019 ve hardly been a noncombatant myself\u2014is just how self-serving they are for Republicans .\nWhen voters say that the single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d and \u201c wokeness , \u201d GOP politicians don \u2019 t have to solve the supply chain crisis or develop a sane response to Russian aggression .\nAfter telling us that they had a better idea than Obamacare ( i.e.\n, their own \u2019 90s-era plan ) for more than a decade , they don \u2019 t have to come up with a replacement .\nMore to the point , they don \u2019 t even have to do anything about gender ideology or the new wokeified race science of white women teenagers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taking pride in your work are vestiges of white supremacy or any of the other new bugbears .\nAll they have to do is mumble along with vague slogans about how what the unspecified other side is doing is bad ( and occasionally funny ) .\nSocial conservatives should be wary of carrying water for the GOP here .\nIf the last administration showed us anything , it was that we should demand more from Republican presidents\u2014especially those who find themselves with control of both houses of Congress and a de facto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBefore , during , and after his presidency , Trump was admired less for anything he actually accomplished in office than for the amusing things he said about his opponents .\nIn a representative democracy , politicians are not elected to make us feel better about ourselves or to offer some kind of existential affirmation of our chosen way of life .\nNor are they in office to attempt to define the nature and purpose of human existence or to debate first-order questions about natural law and morality .\nInstead they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever-expanding number of prudential questions : What should tax rates be ?\nShould we build more bridges ?\nHow about the minimum wage ?\nThe new culture wars provide an opportunity for endless quasi-political blather disguised as \u201c resistance \u201d to a vaguely defined agenda .\nIt also reminds us of the crucial differences between the old religiously inflected social conservatism and the program of inchoate cultural conservatism that has effectively replaced it .\nWhile there was of course a great deal of carrot-and-stick trickery going on , it really was the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , one could vote for a Republican politician because\u2014for example\u2014he opposed same-sex marriage , which was an actual live issue in state legislatures and on ballot boxes across the country .\nThe same was true in a more limited sense of abortion ; when prospective candidates promised to appoint\u2014or vote to confirm\u2014only judges who interpreted the Constitution according to its original meaning etc.\n, voters were made to understand that this meant , at least theoretically , judges who would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade .\nWhat do we expect today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture \u201d ?\nCertainly not opposition to the legalization of online gambling , and other easily preventable evils .\nAre there any bills forthcoming in Congress that would prevent , for example , a financial institution from refusing a checking account to someone because he criticized vaccine mandates ( or even refusing to process a scheduled transaction to an existing account for the same reason ) or an employer firing someone because of his Facebook account ?\nThese examples could be multiplied endlessly .\nI don \u2019 t want to be accused of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact guilty of it , or of a callow above-it-all mentality .\n( A more accurate designation for a long-time unregistered voter and all-around scofflaw like me would be \u201c below-it-all.\n\u201d ) Some of the legislation appearing in Florida , Virginia , and other states meant to restrict the worst excesses of the new race and sex mania is probably for the good .\n( Some

Nazis or transphobes or whatever , is one good one : there was an election five months ago and they lost it .\nWe can \u2019 t replace democracy with rule by whoever has the biggest trucks .\nJustin Trudeau made that argument yesterday defending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protesters .\n\u201c You can \u2019 t hold a city hostage , \u201d he said .\n\u201c What you can do is vote .\nWhat you can do is run for office .\nThat \u2019 s how change happens in a democracy.\n\u201d It is true that in the last election , in September 2021 , Justin Trudeau \u2019 s Liberal Party won 32.6 percent of the popular vote and 160 seats , the lowest popular vote of any ruling party in Canadian history but enough to put together a minority government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that election the Conservative Party did not campaign on an end to vaccine mandates or any of the other issues animating the truckers .\nTheir leader at the time , Erin O \u2019 Toole , tried to chart a middle path , implying Trudeau had mishandled the pandemic without quite opposing any of Trudeau \u2019 s harsh anti-Covid policies .\nHis perceived squishiness is one reason O \u2019 Toole was toppled as party leader within a week of the trucks arriving in Ottawa .\nIf a large portion of the population is unrepresented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not describe them as having been democratically defeated , fair and square , and thus entitled only to shut up and try again next time .\nThis is a point with relevance beyond Canada .\nAcross the Western world , we have seen Covid measures adopted in ways that satisfied democratic forms while evading their substance .\nThe parliamentary democracies of the Commonwealth offered a perfect metaphor for this dynamic when they allowed Zoom to be used as a substitute for debate in the House chamber .\nFor more than a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.K. House of Commons adopted a so-called hybrid system , with only a limited number of M.P.s allowed in the chamber and the rest watching remotely .\nOther Commonwealth countries , including Canada , followed their example .\n\u201c This has meant that instead of answering to a raucous and often querulous and difficult assembly , whose packed ranks can test governments with the largest majorities , ministers had an easy ride , \u201d explained Jonathan Sumption , a former judge and an expert in constitutional law .\nAmerican governments do not \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers do , so we don \u2019 t have the same appreciation for how high the stakes of a debate can be when the threat of a vote of no confidence always looms in the background .\nParliament isn \u2019 t mere theater .\nIt isn \u2019 t all scripted in advance .\nI \u2019 m sure that right now Justin Trudeau \u2019 s pet pollsters are reassuring him that he has the majority of the country behind him .\nHe is nevertheless still vulnerable to the crushing moment when the opposition benches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won \u2019 t come , when even the most irrationally self-confident M.P .\nknows in a sudden burst of insight that it \u2019 s over .\nEveryone who has participated in a Zoom meeting knows that they are more easily managed than in-person meetings\u2014more subdued , less dynamic , subject to the host \u2019 s mute button .\nRemote debate is not the same as real debate , any more than managed democracy is the same as real democracy .\nIn a system of government whose legitimacy rests on democratic deliberation , Zoom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOf course , it did not much matter in April 2020 whether Boris Johnson had to face his opposition in person , because the Labour Party \u2019 s only complaint about lockdowns was that he didn \u2019 t impose them hard enough or fast enough .\nHere we have the bigger problem with the supposed democratic legitimacy of the Covid regime : Almost no elected official or candidate anywhere in the world has run on a platform of destroying it .\nIt has been subject to democratic debate but not much democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bizarre contortions .\nErin O \u2019 Toole was an exemplary gymnast in this respect .\nAsk him what he thought of vaccines , and he \u2019 d say they should not be \u201c politicized \u201d \u2014which is not quite the same as saying they should not be legally mandated or quasi-mandated with an onerous alternative regime of daily testing .\nAsk him what he thought of the truckers , and he \u2019 d say that they should not be \u201c demonized \u201d \u2014which is not quite the same as saying they should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. presidential election saw similar rhetorical convolutions .\nJoe Biden repeatedly accused Donald Trump of allowing hundreds of thousands of negligent deaths without saying what he would have done differently .\nHis pithy line , \u201c I \u2019 m not going to shut down the country , I \u2019 m going to shut down the virus , \u201d had the vagueness of a Zen koan .\nIn the vice presidential debate between Mike Pence and Kamala Harris , the moderator asked explicitly , \u201c What would a Biden administration do in January and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t do ?\n\u201d Harris \u2019 s answer was evasive even by debate standards .\nThe most specific she got was to say , \u201c They still don \u2019 t have a plan .\nJoe Biden does.\n\u201d If a position goes unrepresented in a two-party democracy , there may be good reasons for it .\nPerhaps that position is a \u201c small fringe minority with unacceptable views , \u201d as Trudeau called the truckers .\nBut within days of the convoy arriving in Ottawa , a poll showed a double-digit swing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadians were waiting for someone to tell them it was finally okay to say out loud what they already believed .\nHere in the U.S. , the people whose permission is awaited most eagerly are experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci and CDC director Rochelle Walensky .\nThere has always been a tension between democracy and technocracy , rule by the people versus rule by experts .\nIn the era of Covid-19 , the balance between the two has collapsed and the latter now reigns without challenge .\nThe only comparison I can think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged in the last century in Catholic democracies like Eamon De Valera \u2019 s Ireland .\nThe archbishop of Dublin , John Charles McQuaid , had no formal power , but no one dared cross him .\nThis was no secret either .\nIrish politicians stated publicly , in so many words , that they would never act contrary to the wishes of the Church .\nJust as Ireland was priest-ridden , today we are expert-ridden .\nTheir handmaids in the media can be counted on to bring down an avalanche of bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even those brave politicians who dare to oppose lockdowns and vax mandates are still careful to assure voters that they are following the science , just as Irish politicians promised to follow Catholic teaching , which leaves Fauci and the CDC with the rhetorical upper hand .\nA politician bold enough to confront the consensus head on would still face the threat of lawsuits .\nWe are seeing that now with mask mandates .\nThe ACLU and other left-wing groups are mounting suits against states and school districts that have removed mask mandates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal rights of disabled students to medically necessary accommodations .\nIn these lawsuits , CDC guidance is cited as proof that anti-mask politicians should have known better than to end the mask mandates when experts were telling them not to .\nIn recent weeks , the consensus on mask mandates has had a dam-breaking moment similar to what Canadian polls showed on vax passports and mandates , with even blue politicians abruptly abandoning them in a rapid cascade .\nThe meaning in both instances is the same , that everyone was just waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove policies in which they no longer believed .\nBut in a democracy , experts don \u2019 t decide when policies are allowed to change .\nWe the people do .",

.\nWe paleocons or right-wingers or\u2014gasp\u2014American nationalists are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxing with shadows when we say the war party is back at it .\nWhen we hear drums , we are only revealing our paranoia , and any drum beats that might really be hanging in the air , undeniable , are actually Putin \u2019 s anyway .\nIt is not just that we are wrong to think the Biden Administration and the Washington establishment want a war , it is unpatriotic to think it would be a bad thing if they did .\nPutin , you see , is a very bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which suggests that since Simon didn \u2019 t say \u201c America must go to war with Putin , \u201d in so many words then it hasn \u2019 t been said .\nBut such childishness should come as no surprise , since it is pudding-like statements referring to the Sudetenland and Chamberlain and ( the big one ) \u201c appeasement \u201d that , passed about with smug self-satisfaction , raise the prospect of war in the first place .\nI am not so naive as to think the Swamp intends to cry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip the well-fed dogs .\nNot a whit .\nHavoc is seen in each pointed dismissal of Russian attempts at diplomacy and repeated White House claims of imminent full scale invasion .\nPutin has given his red lines\u2014a NATO member Ukraine , missiles too close to Moscow , et al.\u2014and made his civilizational case .\nIt has all been dismissed out of hand by historical myopics , and Russia presumed an enemy , not a great power rival with its own national interests and sphere of influence .\nHere we see the unselfconscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project on full display , like the titular honesty of Karl Popper \u2019 s Open Society and Its Enemies .\nPutin is surely a threat to the liberal international order , and his meddling in Ukraine is a direct confrontation of global liberalism .\nRussian recognition of independent republics in disputed territory is a cunning reversal of the American-led international community \u2019 s playbook , and like everyone else I wait with bated breath to see what will come next .\nBut while Putin and Russia are illiberal , as of yet none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not our border that is under dispute , and it is , crucially , not a NATO member state that has been intervened in .\nWhile he demands to negotiate with us directly , because for now the Europeans still fall in line , Putin is not testing the United States of America here , but arrangements we presided over only decades old .\nJ.D .\nVance , author of Hillbilly Elegy and a candidate for Senate in Ohio , made many of the usual suspects mad over the weekend when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much about Ukraine \u2019 s eastern border and so little about America \u2019 s southern border , he made the above clear .\nThere is no inconsistency to wanting the free movement of people and money\u2014national sovereignty , domestic security , and per capita productivity and real wages be damned\u2014and seeing authoritarian Putin \u2019 s probing of the hinterland as a threat .\nThis is liberal empire .\nBut it is not American patriotism .\nAs Vance said , he and working class white men like him did not join the Marines to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia is a security threat to America because it is a nuclear power with control of vital natural resources and its own national agenda , not because it is illiberal .\n\u201c At the end of the day , we served to defend our own country , \u201d Vance said .\nThat means right now the border he cares about is in Texas , because Mexican fentanyl is killing his neighbors .\nThis choice between borders shouldn \u2019 t be necessary , but liberal internationalists force us to pick .\nIn a saner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the movement of people restricted according to the law\u2014the law enforced .\nThen we might consider the significance of Ukraine \u2019 s national sovereignty , confident in our own .\nBut globalism has made a joke and a catastrophe of the Rio Grande , and nothing in our recent record as a nation inspires confidence that we can give appropriate care to both that crisis and one an ocean and continent away .\nPriorities must be made , and Vance is right that American leaders have a responsibility first of all to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David French joined the pile-on contra Vance with an essay claiming \u201c We \u2019 re All Ukrainians Now.\n\u201d A healthy patriotism , he alleges , \u201c helps us extend our compassion and concern \u201d all the way to the Donbas .\nTo buttress that conclusion French selectively contorts a typically excellent passage from C.S .\nLewis \u2019 s The Four Loves .\nI read the same section as suggesting very nearly the opposite , that though of course we may sympathize with and have compassion for Ukrainians in the midst of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local first of all .\nThat is , obviously , both what Ukrainian separatists and Russian leaders are up to , too .\nRather than parse French I \u2019 ll let Lewis speak for me and for himself in a few sections , though of course you ought to read the whole thing and consider him in his own context .\nLewis writes , First , there is love of home , of the place we grew up in or the places , perhaps many , which have been our homes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fairly like them ; love of old acquaintances , of familiar sights , sounds and smells .\nNote that at its largest this is , for us , a love of England , Wales , Scotland , or Ulster .\nOnly foreigners and politicians talk about \u201c Britain.\n\u201d Kipling \u2019 s \u201c I do not love my empire \u2019 s foes \u201d strikes a ludicrously false note .\nMy empire !\nWith this love for the place there goes a love for the way of life ; for beer and tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them and an unarmed police force and all the rest of it ; for the local dialect and ( a shade less ) for our native language .\nAnd only a little later : And soon after , to conclude an already meandering column with the suggestion that you read this with the Russian view in mind and not only the western Ukrainian , Lewis writes : Of course patriotism of this kind is not in the least aggressive .\nIt asks only to be let alone .\nIt becomes militant only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any mind which has a pennyworth of imagination it produces a good attitude towards foreigners .\nHow can I love my home without coming to realise that other men , no less rightly , love theirs ?\nOnce you have realised that the Frenchmen like cafe complet just as we like bacon and eggs why , good luck to them and let them have it .\nThe last thing we want is to make everywhere else just like our own home .\nIt would not be home unless it were different .", "author": "Micah Meadowcroft", "url":

city water was yellow again .\nThis has been an issue on and off for several years now , and the days when the city pretended that it was because of unscheduled hydrant flushing are long gone .\nNo one really knows what is happening .\nThe staff at the regional \u201c underground \u201d newspaper are too lazy or too stupid to do anything except solicit comments from a city official , who assures

accountable \u201d \u2014is a more or less representative picture of how local government in America functions today , but because I would like to blame something else on the water : For the second time in as many weeks I have found myself paying close to attention to Congress .\nSpecifically what has caught my attention is the story of Abby Broyles , a Democrat running for a House seat in Oklahoma who made headlines after it was reported that she \u201c verbally accosted [ sic ] \u201d several teenagers at a sleepover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend .\nAccording to a liberal journalism nonprofit not unlike the one that can \u2019 t figure out what is wrong with our water , Broyles spent the evening drinking wine in her friend \u2019 s kitchen , making TikToks with the kiddos and calling them names like \u201c acne fucker \u201d while they all watched Titanic .\nShe also puked at least twice , once in a laundry basket and once on another guest \u2019 s shoes .\nYou can probably imagine where this is going .\nThe Daily Beast is calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused of having \u201c verbally and emotionally abused \u201d the teenagers in question because she called them \u201c judgy \u201d after they refused to sleep with a blanket she had previously employed for cleaning up spilled booze and insisting that they would never be as \u201c successful \u201d as she is .\nMeanwhile , Broyles , after being caught trying to deny that she had been at the party in the first place , is blaming the medication she was on at the time and making vague references to \u201c stress and anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can \u2019 t have nice things .\nIf calling a bunch of annoying teenagers names , especially after you have had a lot to drink , is beyond the pale , then we are much further down the road to ruin than even I had guessed .\nIn my own not-so-remote childhood , hearing the father or mother of one of my friends drunkenly refer to me as an ingrate because I demurred at snuggling up with boozed-soaked linens would not have ranked among even the 500 most agonizing experiences ( though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusing ) .\nHere in the heartland , this kind of thing is still a time-honored tradition : After watching the refs hand Michigan State their only meaningful victory of the season and seeing my own ( very small ) children off on their trick-or-treating adventures with their grandmother , I spent last Halloween drinking beer on my front porch with the lead male cantor of my parish choir , exhorting the 16 and 17-year-olds who showed up dressed as various Japanese cartoon animals to get a job .\nWhen I was their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Recession , I would have walked over broken glass to make half of what any of them could flipping burgers and would have purchased an entire bag of Tootsie Pops ( or , more realistically , an entire log of Skoal from the gas station that didn \u2019 t check IDs , but de gustibus , etc. )\n.\nAt the very least , they should have enough self-awareness to realize that if , despite being legally eligible to drive , they have nothing better to do with their time on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears and demand children \u2019 s treats from their neighbors , a bit of mild heckling is probably in order .\nMuch to its credit , the Oklahoma Democratic Party is refusing to put its thumb on the scale .\nAs the state party chairman told the Daily Beast , \u201c Regarding the party \u2019 s stance on Ms. Broyles candidacy , the party is not in the habit of running candidates off .\nShould Ms. Broyles continue in her pursuit of Oklahoma Congressional District Five , the party will not get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAn America in which someone like Broyles can not represent the good people of Oklahoma in Congress seems like a very dreary place .\nAnd the fact that she is forced to invent absurd excuses rather than acknowledge the truth about what amounts to an ultimately harmless evening of one-sided embarrassment is a serious obstacle to the \u201c female empowerment \u201d promoted by Broyles during her campaign .\nIf , as Hillary Clinton has been reassuring me for virtually my entire adult life , women are just as qualified to reduce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as men are , surely they are equally capable of getting lit up occasionally and taking the piss out of the neighbor kids .", "author": "Matthew Walther", "url":

Wade , not a word about outlawing the most heinous atrocity in the history of human civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposedly pro-life party will actually fight at the most crucial juncture for the unborn in almost half a century .\nAdoption is important , yes , and the reforms Scott vaguely hints at will be a necessary adjunct to the abolition of infanticide .\nBut the heart of the matter is almost entirely ignored .\nLikewise on gender , which the senator restricts to a few particular areas of concern .\nOne is perhaps the most pressing , but in elevating it to the level of appropriate urgency , Scott bizarrely and unnecessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u201c No doctor will be allowed to perform irreversible surgical or gender-altering procedures on any minor child .\nOnce they become adults , they can do what they wish.\n\u201d The other is an extremely minor issue , but one that political operatives have realized polls in our favor : girls \u2019 sports .\nIn other domains , Scott waffles violently between sound reformism and dead-consensus hackery , sometimes in the same sentence .\nTake foreign policy : The agenda even includes a call to \u201c prohibit debt ceiling increases absent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not establish any perverse incentives .\nThen there is criminal justice , with regards to which Scott issues just and pressing calls to \u201c eliminate no-knock warrants in any case that does not involve violent crime \u201d and \u201c increase penalties for spousal abuse and failure to pay child support.\n\u201d Yet he also demands we \u201c stop all efforts to defund or \u2018 re-imagine \u2019 policing , \u201d precluding any efforts to reform a key governmental function that is , in fact , grossly inefficient , ineffective , and ripe for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zeal for reform leads the senator to equally foolhardy conclusions .\nHe promises to \u201c enact term limits for the Washington ruling class\u201412-year limits for Congress and government bureaucrats .\n( Exceptions for national security reasons only . )\n\u201d The carveout for \u201c national security \u201d is either astonishingly stupid or promised with full knowledge of the problems it would exacerbate .\nEven beyond the Blob , though , the unintended consequences of term limits , especially congressional ones , are exactly as severe as you might expect from a policy so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even more shortsightedly , Scott \u2019 s plan contains a suggestion that \u201c All federal legislation sunsets in 5 years .\nIf a law is worth keeping , Congress can pass it again.\n\u201d A far cry from the conservative preference for \u201c few laws , seldom changed.\n\u201d Yet on some questions Scott \u2019 s plan is admirably uncomplicated , with promises to \u201c drastically simplify the tax code , and eliminate the advantages of those who can afford tax lawyers and lobbyists \u201d and \u201c immediately cut the IRS funding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overdue .\nBut this is counterbalanced by perhaps the worst point in Rick Scott \u2019 s 60-page agenda : \u201c All Americans should pay some income tax to have skin in the game , even if a small amount .\nCurrently over half of Americans pay no income tax.\n\u201d Of course , the real problem with the fact that one half of Americans do not pay income tax is the fact that the other half do .\nExpanded income taxation would amount to an

elite institutions and woke ideology .\nThe unspoken questions in the room were palpable : What about 2024 , and what about Trump ?\nThe Yale graduate and Harvard Law alumnus flashed his answers to both .\nTalking fast and hardly looking at his notes ( guests I spoke with afterward said his speed made him sound intelligent ) , DeSantis spent his hour in front of a friendly audience drawing distinctions\u2014between conservatism and libertarianism , between himself and the broader GOP , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president Donald Trump .\nUsing phrases like \u201c military industrial complex \u201d and his now-favorite \u201c biomedical security state , \u201d and shifting the conversation from keywords like \u201c freedom \u201d and \u201c liberty \u201d to courage , justice , and the positive project of government , DeSantis seemed to be using the talk not just to float his presidential prospects , but also to demonstrate his alignment with major goalposts of the new right .\n\u201c Freedom is not enough of a condition to secure a just society , \u201d DeSantis said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you need more .\nThe elites and Big Tech \u201c regime enforcers \u201d need to be taken down a few notches , he said\u2014whether through Section 230 reform or other means was unclear\u2014because \u201c you can \u2019 t have a free society if the majority of the discourse is controlled by a half dozen leftists in Silicon Valley.\n\u201d These are bold words for an audience of conservative donors , many of whom made their success in business , but a lot has changed in the last few decades .\nRegardless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cheers and calls of \u201c Freedom !\n\u201d The governor also rejected the idea that free trade fosters democracy : \u201c We are a country with an economy , not the other way around.\n\u201d He even took a swing at tax cuts .\n\u201c The Republican Party has been very good at saying cut taxes for corporations , \u201d he said .\n\u201c But now , corporations are getting so woke , do we really want to cut their taxes ?\nI \u2019 m not saying raise them , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average American cares about.\n\u201d What Americans care about , more than tax cuts , is what their children are taught in school ; what their grandchildren are becoming at college ; and what their sons are being forced to accept in the military .\nOn the topic of woke ideology , however , the DeSantis was optimistic : \u201c Wokeness is a mile wide\u2014you know , it \u2019 s affected a lot of our institutions\u2014but it \u2019 s only an inch deep .\nIf you stand up against it , the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Likewise with immigration .\nAt least , the governor seemed to bank on as much when he took the conversation a good step beyond mere wall-building : \u201c I think we all want an end to illegal immigration , but even our legal immigration system is not in the best interest of the American people.\n\u201d H1-B visas and chain migration are on his chopping block ; instead , he advocates merit-based immigration .\n\u201c Common culture is very important .\nWhat unites us as a people has to be a belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise it falls apart , \u201d he said .\nThe transition from DeSantis the governor to DeSantis the presidential candidate was seamless .\nAfter concluding his remarks , the governor took a seat at stage left with Hillsdale College President Larry Arnn for a question and answer session .\nArnn prodded DeSantis on nearly every major political issue on the table for 2024 .\nRather than distance himself from the former president , DeSantis styled himself more as a Trump 2.0\u2014everything Trump almost was .\nHow do you advance a conservative agenda while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DeSantis echoed a point he made earlier in the night , that \u201c I got elected governor to make decisions and lead .\nI did not get elected to subcontract those decisions out to the Dr. Faucis of the world.\n\u201d ( On the topic of Anthony Fauci , too , he gracefully avoided blaming one former president by blaming another : \u201c Ronald Reagan should have fired him.\n\u201d ) DeSantis said that when he was elected governor in 2019 , he immediately consulted lawyers to understand the extent of and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s executive .\n\u201c Sometimes , people don \u2019 t know what their authorities are , so they kind of go into a position of power like a bull in a China cabinet .\nBut everything I do , I make sure in advance that I know we can do it , \u201d he said .\nPerhaps most importantly , he did not miss a chance to reflect on the gravest error of the previous administration : \u201c At the federal level , personnel is incredibly important\u2026You have to have people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that aren \u2019 t going to be flattered by the media .\nIf media aren \u2019 t attacking you , you \u2019 re not doing it right.\n\u201d \u201c Have you always been this timid ?\n\u201d Arnn teased .\nAnd indeed , courage\u2014the political virtue even Trump skeptics could laud in the 45th president\u2014seemed to be DeSantis \u2019 preferred topic .\n\u201c Those who stand for the truth will be under the fire , \u201d he said .\n\u201c In times like these , you need to understand the policy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you don \u2019 t have the backbone to fight back , they will steamroll you.\n\u201d And again : \u201c You got ta giddy-up and get ready to tussle.\n\u201d Whether it \u2019 s next year or in a later cycle , DeSantis made his aspirations clear as he concluded his remarks : \u201c I have only begun to fight .\n\u201d", "author": "Carmel Richardson", "url": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/desantis-readies-for-the-national-stage/", "published": "Mon, 28 Feb 2022 05:01:17

"title": "The Kids Are Post-Liberal", "content": "Most institutions of American higher education today are dominated by progressive liberalism .\nBut as elite institutions across the nation spearhead the radicalization of society , a reaction by the students themselves has gone relatively unnoticed .\nMedia headlines regarding university life , on both sides of the political spectrum , focus on the expansion of diversity , equity , and inclusion programs .\nThe University of Michigan \u2019 s DEI department , for example , has 163 staff members .\nPopular media also pay attention to colleges along both coasts moving away from single-sex dorm buildings and even introducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern university from the outside may only hear about scholars who call for the elimination of parental rights , support infanticide , and promote progressive ideology .\nMany institutions of higher education do indeed seek to supplant traditional values with their own system of morality and view of human nature .\nMany students are swept up in this progressive endeavor .\nBut others have come to recognize that the neutral playing-field of \u201c academic freedom \u201d is inherently tilted in one direction .\nStudents responding to the normative , leftist ideology on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a microcosm of broader debates on the American right .\nThe first response calls for a return to a perceived golden age of academic freedom .\nIt accepts classical-liberal ideals , and believes that free and equal persons will naturally discover the truth through rational discussion .\nThus , in the face of the left \u2019 s unequivocal dogmatism , these dissenters propose to fight to have their voices heard , invoking their First Amendment rights as they articulate the traditional , conservative ideals that they believe are necessary for the functioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in this response is dwindling .\nThe second response , on the other hand , perceiving the trajectory of the modern university , believes that the classical-liberal framework has failed .\nThis \u201c post-liberal \u201d view is perhaps in the minority in the nation \u2019 s political landscape , but has become essential to youth who choose to attend elite schools .\nUniversity administrators and professors make normative claims to their students regarding identity politics , inclusion , and , most recently , the moral imperative to follow any Covid-19 policy .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from confronting these issues directly and instead ask that their point of view on these matters be heard , too .\nPerhaps this approach has some pragmatic merit , but as a positive theory for structuring a society or university , it has been all but debunked by the last 200 years of history .\nReforming society requires more than reintroducing a Millian \u201c marketplace of ideas \u201d in which the truth will rise to the surface .\nIdeas that conflate base human desires with personal identity are too pleasant for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our contemporary problems instead lies in conceiving a positive vision for the social order built on substantive moral claims that can inform action .\nIf certain things are inherently bad\u2014like abortion , pornography , and sodomy\u2014then a successful political order will declare them so in law .\nAnd if certain things are inherently good\u2014such as practicing religion , supporting a family , and building organic human community\u2014then these things should be supported by the law .\nUniversity students watch as their left-leaning peers are slowly radicalized through four years of institutionally sponsored propaganda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronouns , not assume gender , and follow all rules blindly .\nAnd many do so unquestioningly .\nAt the institution that I attend , the University of Notre Dame , the indoor masking mandate ended on Friday , February 4 at 5 p.m. Until that hour , a large majority of students complied with the mandate .\nBut as soon as it passed , hardly a mask could be found on campus .\nThis immediate shift could not reflect a scientific realization that the risk caused by Covid-19 dramatically changed at 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it revealed that students were following the rule simply because it was imposed by an authority figure .\nThis example , along with countless others around the country , reinforce that the answer to confronting progressivism is not to request dialogue or permission to speak .\nWhile fruitlessly doing so , the masses will be swept away , and questions that are open one day\u2014such as the debate over gay marriage less than a decade ago\u2014are closed the next .\nAnyone who seeks to re-address such topics will be exiled from the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prestigious university hopes to join .\nThe post-liberal movement is rapidly gaining popularity among university students who are witnessing the ugliest aspect of today \u2019 s liberal order .\nMany who are intellectually ready to embrace this movement do not yet know what it is .\nBut the further universities and society \u201c progress , \u201d the more necessary moving past liberalism will be for those who refuse to comply .\nW.

Russiagate", "content": "Durham seems intent on exposing the larger conspiracy , including the Russia dossier and electronic spying by the Clinton campaign .\nHere are ten questions and answers about Special Counsel John Durham \u2019 s new filing in his Russiagate investigation .\n1 ) Fox says one thing , and CNN says the opposite .\nWho \u2019 s right ?\nThe filing is only 13 pages .\nThe juicy stuff is just a few paragraphs .\nRead it .\n2 ) Could you give me the gist ?\nThe filing is an exercise in legal housekeeping .\nIt asks that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sussmann to retain his current representation , who has a potential conflict of interest .\nSussmann \u2019 s representative works for a law firm that also represents other individuals whom Durham may be going after and may have been involved in the events he \u2019 s investigating , perhaps as witnesses .\nSussmann has been indicted for lying to the FBI .\nHe brought the Trump-Alfa Bank accusations to the FBI pretending to be a patriotic citizen , when he was actually working on Hillary Clinton \u2019 s behalf , trying to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence officers call that \u201c using cover.\n\u201d While the conflict-of-interest issue is interesting , what is newsworthy are claims in the filing that the tech company Neustar and its executive Rodney Joffe ( who was also a law client of Michael Sussmann ) accessed \u201c dedicated servers for the Executive Office of the President ( EOP ) .\n\u201d Joffe , per the filing , then allegedly \u201c exploited this arrangement by mining the EOP \u2019 s DNS traffic and other data for the purpose of gathering derogatory information about Donald Trump.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of researchers at a U.S.-based university \u201d ( likely Georgia Tech ) who had access to \u201c large amounts of Internet data in connection with a pending federal government cybersecurity research contract.\n\u201d Real intelligence officers call that \u201c recruiting sources with demonstrated access , \u201d or informally , \u201c spotting.\n\u201d This is how Joffe would have gotten access to data from Trump \u2019 s private computers .\n\u201c [ Joffe ] tasked these researchers to mine Internet data to establish \u2018 an inference \u2019 and \u2018 narrative \u2019 tying then-candidate Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c In doing so , [ Joffe ] indicated that he was seeking to please certain \u2018 VIPs , \u2019 referring to individuals at Law Firm-1 and the Clinton campaign.\n\u201d Remember metadata , the information about digital communications that Edward Snowden showed us the NSA gathers ?\nDNS data is like that .\nMetadata shows , among other things , when and where a communication started , and where it ended up .\nDNS data , a kind of metadata , comes from the server associated with the Domain Name System .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ an address into your browser , it contacts a DNS server , which translates words into binary code\u2014the numbers the internet actually runs on .\nSame thing for email , TikTok , anything online .\nIf you have access to DNS data , like Joffe did , you know whom a person has communicated with .\nDNS data is a map , and if you have enough of data , patterns emerge\u2014like regular communication with Russia , perhaps .\nThat \u2019 s why real intelligence officers do the same thing against America \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t it true Durham never uses the word \u201c spying \u201d ?\nNeither do real intelligence officers .\nBut what word would you use to describe the secret ( and likely illegal ) collection of information about an enemy that one intends to use against them ?\nDurham is writing a legal document , and must use precise words .\nBut it is pretty hard to call what actually happened anything other than spying , at least in lay terms .\n5 ) How is what Joffe and Neustar did illegal ?\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were two sources of DNS information referred to in the filing .\nLet \u2019 s take them separately .\nThe first source was DNS servers inside the White House .\nNeustar provided these servers under a contract with the government .\nContractors like Neustar , who work on sensitive data systems , do not own the data they see .\nTheir legal ability to use that data is specific to the job they were hired to do , like a doctor who knows you \u2019 re a drunk but can not share that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nReal intelligence officers illegally obtain information from people , like foreign diplomats , who have legitimate access to it , all the time .\nThey call that \u201c their job.\n\u201d The second source Joffe monitored was the DNS data from Trump Tower and other properties via Georgia Tech .\nHe got those records ( along with a trove of other DNS records ) as part of an unrelated contract with the Pentagon .\nGeorgia Tech had no obvious right to share its data with Joffe , and he had no right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes .\nThere has to be a crime in there somewhere .\n6 ) But Joffe and others never read any Trump email or listened in on calls .\nSo , it \u2019 s not spying , right ?\nTime to update the definition of spying from 1945 .\nIn Joffe \u2019 s case , he was trying to establish a pattern of communications between Trump and Russia .\nMichael Sussmann was then to take that pattern to the FBI and CIA as a patriotic bystander , and those agencies would be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this all the time , like when it looks at the people one terrorist has contacted in order to target another .\nReal intelligence officers know this tactic is the core of modern spying .\nThe Clinton campaign was employing it , and using Michael Sussmann as a false front to peddle it .\nThe FBI took the bait .\n7 ) But didn \u2019 t I hear all this DNS monitoring of the White House started under Obama ?\nNeustar got the contract and installed the DNS servers in the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been for some legitimate cybersecurity task and/or to establish a baseline of \u201c normal \u201d White House-Russia communications .\nJoffe continued his DNS monitoring of the White House into February 2017 , after Trump took office .\nHaving failed to stop his campaign , the data was lined up to aid in driving him out of office .\nJoffe monitored the other source\u2014Trump \u2019 s personal and business DNS data\u2014 during the campaign , which of course meant it was while Obama was in the White House but separate from it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Better Call Saul , huh ?\nIn a quid pro quo , Joffe was offered a top cybersecurity job in the future Hillary Clinton administration .\nBut his background goes deep .\nJoffe \u2019 s other company , Packet Forensics , sells equipment that allows law enforcement to spy on private web-browsers through fake internet security certificates .\nJoffe could have easily used his access to the White House servers to install this product and then monitor everything .\nJoffe \u2019 s company has made $ 40 million through federal contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2013 , FBI Director James Comey gave Joffe an award recognizing his work on a case ) and the Pentagon \u2019 s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency .\nJoffe \u2019 s firm also monitors the computers of other government officials for threats , including Justice Department-watchdog Michael Horowitz , who investigated the FBI for its wrongdoing in Russiagate .\nJoffe is in a position to know a lot .\nAnd , small world\u2014Joffe \u2019 s company Packet Forensics landed another , new , Pentagon contract , the bid for which was awarded on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inauguration .\nJoffe will almost certainly be indicted .\nDurham may also probe why the FBI and CIA did not question the source of Sussmann \u2019 s data , given that it could have only come from White House servers .\nIn addition , if researchers at Georgia Tech paid by the U.S. government were freelancing the data they collected to help the Clinton campaign smear Trump , that would be another area for Durham to explore .\nIt \u2019 s likely too late , but Durham might also seize the Neustar-provided DNS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever installed .\nOne of Durham \u2019 s earlier indictments , former FBI lawyer , Kevin Clinesmith , has already been found guilty of falsifying data on a FISA application .\nThe case against Clinton lawyer Michael Sussmann is ongoing , as is the case against Igor Danchenko , who made up most of the material in Christopher Steele \u2019 s dossier .\nKeep your eye on Charles Dolan , a long-time Clinton hack .\nDolan has close ties not only to the Clintons but Moscow ; he did P.R .\nwork for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foreign agent for Russia .\nDolan is credited with , among other things , inventing the \u201c pee tape \u201d story and otherwise using cut-outs to push false information about Trump into the dossier .\n10 ) Is anyone going to jail ?\nDurham \u2019 s filings are like lightning bolts , briefly and unpredictably illuminating part of the whole .\nOne thing seems clear , however .\nThe statute of limitations on many process crimes , like perjury , is short .\nUsing little fish to catch bigger fish is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least in terms of prosecutions .\nSo , you-know-who is not going to jail .\nInstead , Durham seems intent on exposing the larger conspiracy , including the Russia dossier and now electronic spying by the Clinton campaign .\nHe may also expose more fully the FBI \u2019 s role in the affair .\nOne can imagine future hearings in a Republican-controlled House showing what Hillary\u2014never mind Obama and Biden\u2014knew .\nPeter

the event has also triggered the latest outbreak of mass hysteria among the Western ruling class , the severest yet .\nJust when sobriety , responsibility , probity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our pundits and policymakers offer the opposite : trembling emotion , cheap propaganda , wild fantasies , a refusal to dialogue and de-escalate .\nAnd the worst part is : It \u2019 s all so damned familiar .\nOnce

concerns compete for your limited time and attention .\nThat is , until the next trap-laden media event .\nYet we must examine previous episodes .\nFour especially stand out : the post-9/11 wars , the Arab Spring , the European migrant crisis , and the Covid pandemic .\nThese happen to be the defining media moments of my career as a journalist , and in some cases , I fell into the info traps .\nThe experience indelibly shaped my worldview .\nBut you don \u2019 t need to share my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all of these media moments .\nFirst , beware emotionally charged images that tend to overwhelm reason .\nThe Arab Spring should have been instructive on this count .\nFollowing the self-immolation of a Tunisian fruit vendor in 2010 , images of denim-clad , smartphone-wielding young liberals taking to the streets dazzled reporters and social-media users .\nThe images fed a narrative of heroic Jeffersonians facing down hidebound kleptocrats .\nThe fervor suppressed inconvenient questions .\nQuestions like : Were these youths , in fact , representative of their societies , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they happened to look and sound like us ?\nWere they actually prepared to govern their societies , or might their movements be hijacked by less-savory actors ?\nIf Islamists with mass support did end up in power , would the young liberals be able to accept that ?\nWere there reasons to take a more cautious approach , taking into account religious and tribal complexities and the geopolitical fault lines that crisscross the region ?\nNeedless to say , the United States didn \u2019 t pursue a cautious policy , pushing its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of Libya , mounting a military intervention to oust Muammar Gaddafi .\nThe result : instability , civil war , ungoverned spaces , terror , and an eventual return to autocracy in most Arab Spring states .\nEmotive images similarly overwhelmed rational decision-making during the 2015-16 European migrant crisis .\nThe decisive shift toward flinging open the continent \u2019 s gates came in response to a photograph of a Syrian child lying dead on Turkey \u2019 s western shore after trying to reach the Greek isles .\nMore than a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as refugees .\nIt was far from clear how many were , in fact , economic migrants whose crossings had been made possible by human smuggling .\nConcerns about mass migration \u2019 s adverse effects on security , welfare services , and social cohesion were , again , suppressed until much later\u2014when it was too late .\nThe pandemic supplied its share of gripping and potentially misleading images\u2014above all , that of the death and misery in Italy \u2019 s Covid wards , scenes that were certain to arrive at a hospital near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were taken .\nFew inquired about the extent to which Italy \u2019 s horrors were a specific product of Italy \u2019 s health system and its elderly population .\nSecond , beware the treatment of dissent or criticism as treason .\nThis is perhaps the most pernicious pattern in info traps , because it taps into the very human tendency to ostracize and \u201c out-group \u201d dissidents .\nModern media , with their power to incite ravenous mobs , have supercharged this ancient temptation .\nThe mob has been instructed to defend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have second thoughts !\nThus , opponents of the Iraq War , including many who made this magazine their home , were called \u201c unpatriotic \u201d conservatives .\nFrance \u2019 s reservations led to the idiocy of \u201c Freedom Fries.\n\u201d Those who questioned the Arab Spring\u2014including as eminent a scholar of the Middle East as Bernard Lewis\u2014were dismissed as \u201c Orientalists \u201d and worse .\nLikewise , those who questioned Angela Merkel \u2019 s open-door policy could barely get a hearing in the mainstream .\nThen there was Covid .\nEveryone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to boast of his vaccination status online , to post masked selfies .\nTo proclaim # StayHomeSaveLives .\nCritics of job-killing and small-biz-destroying lockdowns were no doubt callous and heartless .\nWhen R.R .\nReno , editor of First Things , warned that the West was succumbing to a dangerous safety-ism , prioritizing physical wellbeing at the expense all other goods , the Catholic University theologian Joseph Cappizi accused him , falsely , of proposing that \u201c the value of life should be measured in economic terms , \u201d of being \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s most vulnerable members.\n\u201d It was a sophisticated way of asking the same question posed by Reno \u2019 s frothy online persecutors : \u201c How many Grannies are you prepared to kill on the altar of your economy , Rusty ?\n\u201d Third and finally , beware delusions of total mastery over complex crises .\nIt \u2019 s all too easy for people speculating on traditional or social media that complex matters are actually simple , that \u201c we \u201d can take drastic measures without worrying about the consequences , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks to its scientific and technological prowess .\nWe think we can \u201c game out \u201d the outcomes , to see around the corner , to prophesy with data .\nTime and again , events make a mockery of this confidence\u2014yet it persists .\nThe Iraq War \u2019 s proponents told us we would be greeted with flowers , that the occupation would be short and sweet .\nOperation Iraqi Freedom plunged the country into chaos and civil war that finally redounded to the benefit of Iran .\n\u201c Wir schaffen das [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel said of the prospect of absorbing a million migrants .\nHer decision dramatically destabilized European politics .\n\u201c Two weeks to flatten the curve \u201d lasted more than two years .\nDo you notice similar patterns in the Western response to the Ukraine crisis ?\nI \u2019 m afraid I do .\nFrom the pictures of grandmothers and photogenic young women taking up Kalashnikovs to defend Ukraine , to ( manufactured ) stories of Ukrainian troops sacrificing themselves rather than surrender , we are being bombarded with one-sided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more treating dissidents and critics as traitors and villains and \u201c Putin shills.\n\u201d The same people who accused lockdown critics of murderous indifference are now accusing critics of escalation of\u2026the same thing : Capizzi on Monday assailed the Harvard Law scholar Adrian Vermeule for \u201c liking \u201d a map circulating online showing Russian forces encirclement of the Ukrainian city of Kharkov .\nVermeule was guilty of

suspects are feeding the dream of a hopeless Ukrainian resistance .\nThese figures are likely merely deepening the Ukrainian people \u2019 s pain , without altering the ultimate outcome of the conflict .\nAnd measures that could plausibly alter the outcome bear the unfortunate risk of bringing us close to the brink of all-out war with Moscow .\nPerhaps that is what many Americans want

"content": "Before he became the avatar of the so-called principled conservatives for his opposition to President Donald Trump , Representative Adam Kinzinger was known for his stirring defenses of endless wars in the Middle East .\n\u201c The easy thing to do is to stand up and say \u2018 Let \u2019 s just declare victory and let \u2019 s leave , \u2019 \u201d Kinzinger said on the House floor in December 2011 .\n\u201c You know the America I grew up in and continue to grow up in and live in is not the country that always picks the easy thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is I believe we do , typically , the right thing.\n\u201d The right thing , as Kinzinger would have it , was the prolonging of the war in Afghanistan that claimed the lives of nearly a quarter of a million people , of whom 2,401 were U.S. servicemen and an estimated 71,000 were civilians , all to prop up a government that collapsed in a matter of days .\nKinzinger was one of many GOP hopefuls elected to congress though the Bush II and Obama era who saw 9/11 and the subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their political development .\nAnother cohort of Republicans perceive 9/11 and its consequences as foundational to their political perspectives , albeit for very different reasons .\nA number are seeking election in 2022 .\nJ.D .\nVance , Joe Kent , and Anthony Sabatini each claim to embrace the \u201c America First \u201d vision of foreign policy popularized by President Trump .\nWhile the Washington establishment beats the war drums over Ukraine , these America First candidates have not only cautioned against the prospect of war with Russia but argued fervently that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the current regime is a distraction from the issues that plague everyday Americans .\nThese candidates \u2019 choice to use the ongoing situation in Ukraine as a platform to focus on domestic issues is a needed deviation from what has traditionally been expected of Republican hopefuls .\nFor the first two decades of the 21st century , Republicans have camouflaged their inconsistencies , idleness , and general lack of vision on domestic policy by turning to foreign affairs , where Republicans believe their projection of American strength plays well with the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well in Washington today , where many GOP Hill staffers think another Biden foreign policy conundrum will spell disaster for Biden in the midterms and may be the first ring of the death knell for his presidency .\nRather than pivoting away from the domestic for the foreign , America First Republicans are trying to flip the script .\nVance , who is running for Senate in Ohio , told TAC in a phone interview the day prior to Russia \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine that putting American interests first means \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligation to serve American citizens , and that \u2019 s it.\n\u201d This seems like an obvious , sensible notion , but this wasn \u2019 t the case for Middletown , Ohio , Vance \u2019 s hometown .\nFrom J.D.\n\u2019 s youth to early adulthood , the blue collar jobs that kept families and the local economy afloat largely vanished due to policies of globalization pursued by Washington and capitalized on by Wall Street .\nAs the jobs moved out , the drugs moved in .\nVance \u2019 s upbringing , popularized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined by the very forces afflicting not only Middletown , but large swaths of Appalachia and the Rust Belt , two regions that acutely felt the effects of America \u2019 s policies of globalization and intervention .\nEven though Washington had failed Vance \u2019 s family , and so many like it , in the wake of 9/11 he was called to serve in the Marine Corps in April 2003 .\n\u201c I was a patriotic Young Conservative kid .\nI supported the Iraq war , \u201d he said .\n\u201c But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our country make a series of historic , catastrophic decisions and every single person who is involved in those decisions was rewarded for it\u2014financially and with public public appreciation .\nAnthony Sabatini , the 33-year-old Florida state representative running for Florida \u2019 s 7th Congressional seat , was just entering his teens when the war on terror began .\nAt 19 , he joined the National Guard , where he currently has the rank of captain .\nThe War on Terror , Sabatini told TAC during a phone interview the day before Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most obvious example or event that formed my opinion of Americas it \u2019 s guided foreign policy and arguably corrupt foreign policy establishment.\n\u201d Of these America First candidates , 9/11 and the American regime \u2019 s subsequent wars in the Middle East had undoubtedly the most profound impact on Kent \u2019 s life .\nAt 18 years old , Kent enlisted in the Army as an infantryman , and worked his way up into the Ranger Regiment before joining the Special Forces and became a chief warrant officer in the Green Berets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c the most formative experience in my life , \u201d Kent served in 11 combat tours , from Iraq to Yemen and North Africa , earning six Bronze Stars in the process .\n\u201c I saw firsthand what happens when all of our energies are focused overseas .\nThe end goal or starting point wasn \u2019 t about what \u2019 s best for America , \u201d Kent told TAC over the phone on the first day of the Russian invasion .\n\u201c It was on these very lofty ideas like nation building or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit the military industrial complex and our ruling class.\n\u201d On January 16 , 2019 , Kent lost his wife , United States Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer and Cryptologic Technician Shannon Kent , in a suicide bombing while fighting ISIS in Syria , leaving Joe to care and provide for their two young sons .\nShe was 35 .\n\u201c As a guy who fought on the front lines , lost friends , lost my late wife , if we \u2019 re going to go and expend effort somewhere , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , \u201d Kent told TAC .\n\u201c I wish I could be at the end of my military career as a professional soldier or as a gold star husband and say it was all worth it and say we accomplished something here , but we didn \u2019 t .\nWhile Kinzinger and other establishment Republicans are approaching the current conflict in Ukraine like every other war they \u2019 ve stumped for in the past two decades , these hopefuls and candidates like them believe the United States should largely stay out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to America \u2019 s domestic rot .\nAt the core of this pivot from the foreign to the domestic , Vance told TAC , \u201c is the recognition of basically human psychology : that we can only focus on so many things at once , and we have very real problems that are going unsolved in our own country , but we have a leadership completely obsessed with a country 6000 miles away that has nothing to do with our security.\n\u201d To those who say the United States can do both , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chew gum at the same time is contradicted by the past 30 years of American history , where our leadership has been good at one thing\u2014if that .\nSo if we \u2019 re focused on Ukraine , we \u2019 re not focusing on , for example , the border of our own country , \u201d Vance said .\n\u201c I guess it \u2019 s such an unbelievable accident of history , \u201d Vance went on to say , that \u201c at the same time we \u2019 ve had this massive assault on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foreign policy blob that \u2019 s more concerned with the territorial integrity of a country 6,000 miles away .\nI think that there \u2019 s a pretty stark contrast between what we are caring about in this country and what we should care about.\n\u201d Sabatini said what \u2019 s going on in Ukraine isn \u2019 t even \u201c a top ten issue.\n\u201d \u201c The way I filter all foreign policy is how it affects the great swaths of actual Americans , like middle class and working class Americans , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Sabatini said , adding that overreacting to a Russian invasion with broad sanctions could result in higher prices for American families .\nIn Sabatini \u2019 s view , Americans have experienced \u201c a really serious breakdown of all of our institutions in this country .\nWe have a regime that basically decided war on its own citizens , and we \u2019 re about to probably lose the republic if we don \u2019 t correct course.\n\u201d \u201c So any conversations about regional conflicts between nations on the opposite side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly a way of distracting people and pushing back on the critical mass Americans are reaching right now in terms of trying to change our own government , \u201d Sabatini added .\n\u201c I \u2019 m running for office because I \u2019 m trying to stop this systematic destruction of the middle class and the working class , and that \u2019 s what \u2019 s happening everyday in America .\nOur middle class is going away and we \u2019 ll all basically be serfs to this global hegemonic managerial elite that runs every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s wars of choice , whether in the Middle East or potentially Ukraine , Sabatini said , is the political and economic elite \u2019 s attempt at capturing \u201c more owned space.\n\u201d If elected in November , these candidates told TAC they \u2019 d pursue a vastly different foreign policy than the one currently espoused by both the Biden administration , who has pursued harsh sanctions against Russia , and the Republican establishment says sanctions did not come hard or swift enough .\nRather than ice Putin and Russia out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures , which are unlikely to work given the Russian oligarchs atop the Russian economy have insulated themselves against U.S. sanctions , especially since 2014 , Vance said , \u201c the overarching goal here should be to make Russia an ally of ours or at least a partner of ours in the longer-term struggle against China.\n\u201d \u201c If you are applying broad-based stations , and some of our idiot leaders are threatening nuclear warfare against the Russians , you \u2019 re going to be pushing Russia into the arms of the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Vance claimed .\n\u201c Everybody is so hung up on Vladimir Putin being a bad guy .\nWe deal with bad people all the time when it \u2019 s in our national security interests.\n\u201d America \u2019 s foreign policy , Vance told TAC , must \u201c re-inject a dose of realism and recognize [ we \u2019 ve ] got to work with bad people to get something done for [ our ] own citizens .\nThe constant threat of military action , more than anything else , is pushing Vladimir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe \u2019 ve got to stop that.\n\u201d While these candidates are skeptical of both Democrats and Republicans pushing hard sanctions on Russia , they do agree with the Republican establishment line that kneecapping the U.S. energy industry diminished the amount of leverage the U.S. had in its negotiations with Russia .\n\u201c Trump was criticized heavily by the mainstream media , obviously with the nonsensical , fake Russian collusion narrative , but also when he would go over and attempt to deal with Vladimir Putin , \u201d Kent told TAC .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s an experienced negotiator , went to go deal with Vladimir Putin , he started from a position of strength .\nHe made sure America was not just energy independent , but was a net exporter .\nHe leaned on the Europeans .\nHe leaned on NATO .\nHe leaned on the Germans about buying Russian oil and gas .\nHe was taking a serious chip out of Vladimir Putin \u2019 s one commodity .\nRussia , at the end of the day , Russia is a gas station with nuclear weapons.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline and lift sanctions on the construction of the Nord Stream II pipeline , Kent said , meant that Biden \u201c went to the table with pretty much nothing in his back pocket.\n\u201d \u201c An America First foreign policy starts at home , \u201d Vance said .\n\u201c If we had a still robust energy sector like we did two years ago , I think we would be in a much better position to deal with the current crisis.\n\u201d Over the past 20 years , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting its way over and over again when it comes to wars of choice .\nAs we all wonder how the establishment will manage the current crisis , these America First candidates are looking to make sure that doesn \u2019 t happen again .", "author": "Bradley Devlin", "url": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/putting-america-before-ukraine/",

McNamee/Getty Images ) I call \u2019 em as I see \u2019 em .\nIn my view Joe Biden \u2019 s first State of the Union address was a rousing success , and I can not be the only person who went to bed on Shrove Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was especially heartened when the president informed the nation and untold anxious millions around the globe that \u201c Our forces are not going to fight Ukraine.\n\u201d Until that point I must admit I hadn \u2019 t quite realized war with Ukraine had been on the table , but it was certainly reassuring to learn that after years of doing everything in our power to make the present situation in Eastern Europe all but inevitable , we were not in fact going to take the final step of actually joining Putin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were other assurances very welcome to peaceniks like yours truly , including wholly unexpected words of consolation directed at our erstwhile enemies the \u201c Iranian people.\n\u201d ( This no doubt is what prompted an

of our age , it was good to learn that Biden intends to \u201c stop doctors from prescribing treatments.\n\u201d My only question was how he squared this with his stark declaration that he himself had \u201c ordered more pills than anyone in the world has.\n\u201d Perhaps , like Kennedy putting together a cigar stash on the eve of announcing the embargo of Cuba , he just meant that he has been

have any meaning independent of the context in which they are announced .\nI for one have my doubts .\nThis is why I found the speech supremely insightful .\nIt reminded us , in case there was any

scientific establishment is finally admitting were little better than superstitions , for the very real negative consequences of the latter , and for Putin \u2019 s war in Ukraine .\nThe greatest

if two only , they would seek to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as there are at least thirty , they live together in peace and happiness.\n\u201d Fin de si\u00e8cle Vienna , the capital of the empire , was a cosmopolis of culture , of Strauss and Klimt and Freud , boasting a prosperous middle class that could afford operettas , museums , and even psychoanalysis .\nOn the more rigorous economic side of things , Ludwig von Mises , born in Galicia ( now part of Ukraine ) , chose to make his home in Vienna , where he gave rise to the Austrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of libertarianism today , von Mises was doing his best to put forth a humane alternative to the nasty isms that were emerging all around him .\nIn the meantime , Budapest , the Hungarian capital , was also a boom town , a cultured city of one million , a place of refuge from the pogroms of Russia , boasting the continent \u2019 s first underground subway system .\nIn the first half of the 20th century , Hungary was home to five Nobel Laureates .\nTo be sure , Austria-Hungary was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalism of its constituent parts .\nThe empire had a way of dealing with them .\nIt was a place of myriad Burkean compromises , of little platoons and big platoons , studded with feudal associations , tribal councils , and plenty of local color .\nThe point is not that Austria-Hungary was paradise , merely that , given the alternatives , it wasn \u2019 t so bad .\nAs always in human affairs , the pertinent question comes from realpolitik : compared to what ?\nIn 1914 , Austria-Hungary plunged into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a war of choice .\nAs we Americans know all too well , plenty of countries have done that , and they often end badly .\nFor the Dual Monarchy , defeat in the Great War spelled the end .\nThe Habsburgs were deposed , and the empire was broken up by the treaties of Saint-Germain and Trianon ( beyond Versailles , the French made good use of their old palaces for treaty-signing ) .\nThe imperial fragments became four new countries , with pieces of Habsburg land being added to four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t sound so good as a possible guidebook for America .\nBut World War I left every European country worse off ; it was a giant lose-lose .\nAnd if we stay with our realpolitik theme\u2014compared to what ?\n\u2014we can observe that the old Habsburg dominions , now on their own , were soon worse off .\nAs Winston Churchill wrote in the first volume of his war memoirs , published in 1948 : \u201c There is not one of the peoples or provinces that constituted the Empire of the Hapsburgs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought forth the tortures which ancient poets and theologians reserved for the damned.\n\u201d The condition of the former Habsburg provinces has improved in recent decades .\nThat improvement is due in part to the European Union\u2014which , as many have noted , as a hodge-podge much resembles the old Habsburg regime .\nJust as with the Habsburgs of yore , the mandarins who run the EU today are undemocratic yet tolerant .\nThey cheerfully preside over inequality , yet they also have taken steps to eliminate poverty .\nThey are liberal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it\u2014nobody in Brussels is sending troops to coerce Poland over its pro-life abortion laws .\nIn fact , the EU barely has the troops to defend its own borders ; in that sense , the EU and Biden \u2019 s America have much in common .\nFew are flag-wavingly loyal to the EU , but few want to exit .\nThe EU is rich enough such that even Hungary \u2019 s conservative leader , Viktor Orb\u00e1n , vociferous critic that he is , expresses no desire to actually take his country out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferenc De\u00e1k , the Hungarian statesman who engineered the compromise of 1867 , which kept Hungary within the greater Austrian ambit .\nOthers have reached the same conclusion .\nIn September 2021 , eminent historian Paul Kennedy opined in the Economist , \u201c America is looking rather like the old Habsburg model , possessing large though weary armed forces , stretched across too many regions .\nAnd America \u2019 s defeat in Afghanistan , leaving military equipment strewn across much of that country , also has a Habsburgian ring to it.\n\u201d Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect .\nAnd yet if that \u2019 s the way it is\u2014if things are that bad\u2014we should be realistic enough to play events as they lay .\nOnly then can we make the best of a weak hand .\nLet us be true to one another : We are a mongrel society , somewhere between multiethnic and multicultural , and that \u2019 s not about to change .\nWe have at least as many internal schisms as external threats , which is good , because our armed forces , lavishly funded as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressive .\nThe Iraq War , launched with hubristic high hopes in 2003 , was to us what Suez was to the British in 1956 , the moment when we realized that we no longer have the right stuff of imperialism .\nThe first obligation of statecraft is to know one \u2019 s time , and the first duty of strategy is to correlate goals and means .\nOur statespersons and strategists should recognize that today we are in an 1860s-ish crisis , and the solution this time might be Habsburgian , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let \u2019 s ask : Does the 46th president have any of the gravitas of the 16th president ?\nDoes Biden seem like the sort of man who can bring about a Gettysburg Address\u2013type \u201c new birth of freedom \u201d ?\nOr a Gettysburg-like military victory ?\nDown the road somewhere , all this might change .\nMaybe some unifying leader will emerge , or maybe Augustus Caesar Zuckerberg will put our tottering republic to rest and restart us as a mightier empire .\nIn the meantime , none of the current crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , by word or by sword .\nIn the absence of a triumphant Appomattox , a textual Ausgleich starts to look pretty good .\nAs we look to the past for signs of inspiration , we might be further inspired by the realization that Austro-Hungary was really just the last act of the long-running Habsburg Show .\nAfter Rudolph of Habsburg defeated Ottokar II of Bohemia in 1278 , the dynasty ruled a good chunk of territory .\nFrom the 16th century to the early 20th century , Austria was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time , the Habsburgs had game , and how did they do that ?\nMany answers come from A. Wess Mitchell \u2019 s 2018 volume , The Grand Strategy of the Habsburg Empire .\nMitchell is himself a dualistic figure : He was appointed by President Trump to serve as assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs , and at the same time he maintained his blue-state credentials\u2014his book was published by Princeton University Press .\nThe same dualistic canniness graces his tome , which focuses on the Habsburgs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. Mitchell observes of Habsburg history , \u201c In a century that seems well on track to delivering a scale of geopolitical turmoil that no one could have imagined in the heady days after 1989 , the experiences of an empire that weathered centuries of change\u2026seem more relevant than ever.\n\u201d What are some of these relevancies ?\nMitchell explains : \u201c Although geographically contiguous , the territories that made up the Habsburg Monarchy \u2019 s geopolitical base were semi-independent polities with little in the way of a common political character.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such internal divisions , Mitchell continues , came military weakness .\nThe Habsburgs had to develop compensatory workarounds ; they became skilled at building fortresses and even more skilled at making maps to help them manage their own security .\nThis was , of course , a defensive posture for the Habsburgs ; by contrast , today , American armed forces are still arrayed to be on the offense\u2014or , as the jargon has it , ready for \u201c force projection , \u201d that is , ready to liberate a country at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pentagon \u2019 s yen for over-the-horizon wargaming , it \u2019 s no wonder that we fail at even the bare basics of border security .\nParadoxically , for all our high-flying , world-saving , rhetoric , we \u2019 re not fit for a foreign war .\nDoes anyone think that the American people have any enthusiasm for a fight over Taiwan ?\nOr Ukraine ?\nMoreover , does anyone think that Biden could deliver a ringing Rooseveltian declaration of war , rallying the nation ?\nOf course , we might well stumble into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened , eventually , to the Habsburgs\u2014and it didn \u2019 t work out well for them .\nThe Habsburgs bolstered their weaknesses with alliances .\nAs was said in their heyday , Bella gerant alii , tu felix Austria nube ( \u201c Let others wage war : thou , happy Austria , marry \u201d ) .\nDuring the period of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars , the Austrians were part of no fewer than six coalitions against France .\nThe first five coalitions were defeated , and the Austrians sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the seventh coalition was ultimately victorious .\nThus it was Napoleon , not the Emperor Franz II , who died in exile .\nMitchell , ever the realist , concludes his tour of the Habsburg horizon : \u201c Herein is a weary wisdom anchored in the humility that comes from the realization that geopolitical problems can rarely be solved , only managed.\n\u201d From such wisdom \u201c comes an acceptance that the task of enlightened statecraft in all generations is to build the sturdiest bulwarks that we can against the old chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we have seen , the internal divisions of the Habsburg dominions cut against their military power .\nThat \u2019 s one reason why they never sought out overseas colonies , saving them all the grief and guilt suffered by more aggressive powers .\nThere \u2019 s something we could learn : Knock it off on the force projection .\nOur sword is brittle , so it \u2019 s best to use it only sparingly .\nDefense yes , offense no .\nSecond , in the absence of hard power , soft power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Liszt , the Austro-Hungarians developed much of the world \u2019 s high culture\u2014that \u2019 s soft power .\nIn 1914 , when the same empire tried to project its hard power against Serbia , a nation with a fraction of its population , it was defeated .\nThus the lesson : Stick to what you \u2019 re good at .\nThe peoples of the world from Vietnam to Somalia to Afghanistan have shown that they don \u2019 t want us to invade their countries .\nEven after beating back our hard power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power ; many of those same peoples wish to come here .\nWe certainly don \u2019 t have to let them all in , but it \u2019 s still flattering to be an object of desire , confident that at minimum they \u2019 ll continue to consume our pop culture .\nThird , speaking of desire , we can recall that the Austrians were often more effective at making love , not war .\nIn our time , in the same suggestive spirit , we can recall a 2012 book co-authored by Meghan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A Love Letter to Freedom .\nOur Constitution and our Bill of Rights weren \u2019 t written for the sake of l \u2019 amour , and yet Aphrodite smiles at the way it has worked out .\nIn the coming struggle against the neo-Maoist puritans in China , our Vegas ways will have the talented and the creative streaming from there to here .\nFourth , we must fear over-centralization\u2014of any kind .\nThe Habsburgs didn \u2019 t have an ideology that favored decentralization and subsidiarity , but it was their tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they tolerated and respected lumpy local ways .\nThis live-and-let-live policy didn \u2019 t save them , but it kicked the can forward for a few hundred years\u2014which is a kind of saving .\nWe must prevent an over-concentration of power at the top .\nAs Michael Lind wrote recently in American Affairs , \u201c There is increasing evidence that the overstaffed , ever-expanding managerial elite has mutated into a parasitic caste that is destroying its host , the wage-earning national majority.\n\u201d So there \u2019 s a project , Americans : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul-suckers .\nFifth , as did the Habsburgs , we must recognize the inevitability of internal division .\nIn fact , properly thought through , internal distinctions can be a strength , not a weakness\u2014that \u2019 s the genius of federalism , which is , after all , planned compartmentalization .\nIf we allow for that sort of healthy distributism , we can free ourselves from an unhealthy subservience to a central authority .\nKevin Roberts , the new president of the Heritage Foundation , made this point when he wrote recently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of just about every major institution in American life and turned America \u2019 s classrooms , boardrooms , and newsrooms into ideological reeducation camps.\n\u201d So what to do ?\nRoberts \u2019 answer : \u201c In an economy and culture as centralized as ours , conservatives should be looking not just to federalism , but an overdue campaign of decentralization.\n\u201d In the years to come , the U.S. is unlikely to stop the further striation of the nation , red against blue .\nBut so what ?\nIf the men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t want to fight anymore , well , they won \u2019 t ever have to ; most likely , enough South Carolinians will still wish to serve and protect , so long as we choose our foreign enemies with parsimony .\nThen the people of Massachusetts can double down on being themselves , advancing everything from the biotech revolution to gender fluidity .\nIn the meantime , the people of the Palmetto State , and all the other red states , will be happy knowing that folks in the Bay State , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying exactly where they are\u2014on the other side , perhaps , of a quasi-divorce divide .\nThis is not a formula for heroic feats , but it might prove to be a formula for dualistic flourishing .\nAs the Habsburgs demonstrated , surviving is winning .", "author": "James P.

are these attitudes a threat to national security ?\n\u201d Neumann answers : \u201c They are extremely dangerous.\n\u201d Again , though , it gets worse : \u201c There are between 10 million to 30 million Americans who believe that violence is justified at times to achieve political ends .\nBy the way , that meets the definition of terrorism.\n\u201d I wonder if there is anyone in the world who does not believe that violence is justified at times to achieve political ends .\nThe first post-lunch panel , \u201c Principled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Century , \u201d is unlikely to offer me an answer .\nKori Schake , foreign-policy guru of the American Enterprise Institute , expresses early on a hope that Putin \u2019 s invasion \u201c shocks us into a renewed seriousness about foreign policy.\n\u201d At a summit where I \u2019 ve spotted more than a little Bush-Cheney memorabilia , the Atlantic \u2018 s Tom Nichols draws a surprisingly critical comparison : \u201c As an American it pains me to say , [ Putin ] \u2019 s not the first guy to make the \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake.\n\u201d But Schake has the solution : \u201c Civil society is the superpower of freedom.\n\u201d Extra-governmental entities just need to take up the mantel of democracy .\nShe points to \u201c the hackers \u2019 group Anonymous , \u201d which has conducted anti-Russian cyber attacks , as an exemplar .\n\u201c What free societies have is accountability , \u201d Schake continues , \u201c and authoritarian societies don \u2019 t. \u201d She adds that \u201c we should be supporting Alexei Navalny , \u201d a Russian politician whose domestic support tends to hover in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in : \u201c Putin is , you know , he does judo .\nAnd I don \u2019 t know anything about judo other than watching Vladimir Putin do judo .\nBut the basic idea of judo is that you use your enemies \u2019 momentum against them.\n\u201d Okay ?\nOn China , Nichol \u2019 s believes it \u2019 s \u201c a good thing \u201d that the Chinese have managed to surpass the U.S. on the geoeconomic stage , because \u201c the Chinese are so woven into the global economy now that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quo.\n\u201d ( Schake , who \u201c still believe [ s ] Hegel is right and that as people grow more prosperous they become more demanding political consumers , \u201d seems to agree . )\nBesides : \u201c The average American home has 3 televisions in it now .\nHow did you think that was going to happen ?\nBy magic ?\n\u201d As to whether an America First economic strategy is appealing to American voters , Nichols says simply : \u201c I don \u2019 t know , I \u2019 m not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , but I can say that it \u2019 s losing us Asia.\n\u201d And how could Americans even think about such things when \u201c there \u2019 s a war raging in the middle of Europe .\nA WAR raging in the middle of EUROPE.\n\u201d This is to be expected , though , after\u2014as Schake says\u2014the U.S. under Biden \u201c abandon [ ed ] the people of Afghanistan.\n\u201d ( Read : Ended a disastrous two-decade war . )\nAnd make no mistake : American obligations to Afghanistan are as real as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste , because \u201c the truths we hold to be self-evident are universal.\n\u201d That \u2019 s why un-Americans like Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin are \u201c working to prevent our ability to give people a choice.\n\u201d That , says Nichols , is \u201c why they \u2019 re so afraid.\n\u201d He warns that our Americanism can not be \u201c disembodied , \u201d though I struggle to think of anything less embodied than such globalized abstraction .\nHe also thinks the Biden administration must be cut some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year of restoring global democracy .\nListen , \u201d Nichols says , \u201c Joe Biden and the rest of us are up to our necks in a battle to restore democracy here in the United States.\n\u201d Somehow , this is an applause line .\nThere \u2019 s an opportunity here , though : \u201c I believe the last time a president made the case for the American role in the world was the first term of the George W. Bush administration.\n\u201d And that went swimmingly .\nShay Khatiri of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moderator , but he jumps on the mic for some editorializing about the Ukrainian people : \u201c They are our brothers in arms , our sisters in arms , and they are the front line of democracy right now.\n\u201d That \u2019 s a wrap on national security .\nVindman \u2019 s chief concern right now is that the United States is not doing enough for the country he was born in .\nThough $ 3.5 million taken from the American people had been pledged to Ukraine , Vindman felt , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be bigger than that .\nIt should be 35 billion for reconstruction.\n\u201d Nor should there be any limit to the weaponry we send : \u201c Any capability they want we give it to them\u2026 \u2019 cause they \u2019 re fighting for our freedom.\n\u201d ( Though the people suffering under Putin \u2019 s invasion have my sympathy and even admiration , it has not been explained to me here or elsewhere what exactly they \u2019 re doing on behalf of my freedom in America . )\nAs the officer closes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bright idea : There are plenty of American-made Patriot missile defense systems in Israel .\nWhat if our allies loaned them to the Ukrainians just for a little while ?\nVindman gets visibly uncomfortable , but strings together an answer : \u201c Unfortunately Israel has a very deep relationship with Russia , and there \u2019 s a large Jewish population , and Russia is holding Israel over a barrel.\n\u201d Vindman is followed by another hero of the Trump-haters : Harry Dunn , an officer with the United States Capitol Police .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he begins he says over and over : \u201c This is the biggest crowd I \u2019 ve ever seen.\n\u201d Total attendance at the summit is roughly 300 people .\nI don \u2019 t mean to be glib , but I know of at least one other political rally at which Harry Dunn was present that was orders of magnitude bigger .\nDunn mentions Tucker Carlson \u2019 s criticism of him the night before he testified before the 1/6 committee , in which the Fox host called the cop \u201c an angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , admitting that he is , in fact , angry , left-wing , and an activist\u2014making him \u201c an angry left-wing activist.\n\u201d This declaration is met with roaring applause and some good-natured laughter .\nExplaining how he works in the same building as politicians whose views he does not like , Dunn says , \u201c That one person , I \u2019 m not gon na let them speak out for the million people they represent.\n\u201d I wonder what he thinks the point of representative government is .\nHe closes by paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lost his life , \u201d neglecting to mention that Brian Sicknick died naturally of stroke ( according to the D.C. chief medical examiner ) the day after the riot .\nThe next panel has Katherine Mangu-Ward of Reason , Alex Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute , and Andy Smarick of the Manhattan Institute discussing libertarianism and conservatism .\nMangu-Ward , the moderator , asserts that \u201c fiscally conservative and socially liberal \u201d people like her make up the \u201c big round middle \u201d of the American political horseshoe , apparently unaware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination on the traditional four-quadrant political compass .\nSmarick , who functions as the panel \u2019 s right-limit , asserts without explanation that \u201c the freest people end up being the most tradition-bound people.\n\u201d He goes on to explain that the standard GOP view on free-marketeerism is that making a pie grow makes all the pieces bigger .\nI wonder if Smarick knows that pies , being pies and all , are not actually capable of growth .\nHe \u2019 s confused by recent changes : \u201c Sometimes Democrats sound like they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that \u2019 s something I never would have expected .\nWhat \u2019 s happening ?\nWhat \u2019 s happening ?\n\u201d Nowrasteh is less patient .\nHe \u2019 s angry about the \u201c crisis of confidence \u201d on the American right with respect to laissez faire capitalism , exemplified by institutions like Oren Cass \u2019 s American Compass and leaders like Senator Josh \u201c Howley.\n\u201d He pitches a libertarian absolutism : \u201c I don \u2019 t just want to devolve to the state or the local government I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get rid of my HOA , there \u2019 s too much community where I live.\n\u201d Nowrasteh really won \u2019 t let up : \u201c We send our kids to Catholic school ; we \u2019 re not religious , but\u2026 \u201d I \u2019 ve had enough .\nI \u2019 m going home .\nI enter the event room just in time to hear some guy tell Heath Mayo , \u201c You \u2019 re good at that microphone , \u201d with another shooting back : \u201c Yeah , when \u2019 s he going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought , and take my seat .\nIn a minute someone shuffles past me in the first nice suit I \u2019 ve seen all weekend\u2014a grey windowpane pattern , and obviously tailored .\nIt \u2019 s David Frum , the Canadian-born George W. speechwriter who now works at the Atlantic .\nHe kicks the morning off with an \u201c old Soviet joke \u201d : Applause drowns out what Frum is saying , then : \u201c I think you can say in the spirit of that Russian joke\u2026 \u201d ( Oh no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s going to say it . )\n\u201c \u2026our Ukrainians are beating their Russians.\n\u201d Whew .\nThat could have been a whole lot worse .\nTwenty-six minutes of nothing ensue .\nThen a deep-voiced woman in jeans and a sports coat sidles up to the podium : \u201c Man , there \u2019 s nothing like some David Frum first thing in the morning.\n\u201d It makes sense in a second : \u201c I \u2019 m Sarah Longwell ; I \u2019 m the publisher of the Bulwark.\n\u201d But wait ; it gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , \u201c So I have known Walter [ Olson ] since the gay-marriage fight days , back when I was the head of the Log Cabin Republicans\u2014first female board chair , had to resign because they really want to do endorse Donald Trump , and I didn \u2019 t. \u201d Longwell poses an interesting question to Mindy Finn , a panelist and CEO of something called Citizen Data : That \u2019 s why we need to focus on leading by example and kitchen-table issues .\n\u201c That \u2019 s how Moses inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayo ] inspires , and that \u2019 s how each of you will take back what is so rightfully ours , and that is the leadership of this wonderful nation , to become one of the best countries.\n\u201d He catches himself : \u201c It always has been the best country .\nBut that is what we \u2019 re doing today .\nAnd that \u2019 s what this is about.\n\u201d Villalba is very proud of a 2016 op-ed in which he \u201c called Donald Trump , who had just been nominated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 an orange , buffoonish ape , not worthy of our consideration , a misogynist , and somebody who should be eradicated from the American conversation.\n\u2019 \u201d I wonder if Villalba\u2014who cuts , shall we say , a rather imposing figure\u2014sees any irony in attaching such importance to another man \u2019 s physical appearance .\nDiscussing how he wants to punch people , Villalba ( a fourth-generation Texan from Grand Prairie ) says , \u201c You can take the Latino out of the barrio , but you can \u2019 t take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An accent appears inexplicably for this line and this line only . )\nShah shows less machismo , explaining that these conferences have felt to her like a kind of \u201c group therapy.\n\u201d Without a hint of irony , she trots out a well-worn meme by ascribing her own political sensibilities to her inconceivably mature kindergartener .\nThis anecdote is taking as a launching board for a sort of Principles First Manifesto : She adds that \u201c this means putting aside our differences and committing to ourselves and to one another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit idly by while dictators like Putin , or his admirers like Donald Trump , trash the very principles this beautiful land was founded upon.\n\u201d Circling back to the pity party , Shah\u2014who has made a career out of being anti-Trump , complains : \u201c I feel that this fight has aged me sometimes , I have to be honest .\nI feel that it \u2019 s become incumbent on me to always be the adult in the room , and I just want to be a kid sometimes.\n\u201d Ms. Shah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 38 or 39 years old .\nIt \u2019 s been a while since Keev came up , so Shah makes sure to circle back : \u201c If Ukraine falls , soon , we \u2019 ll all be paying the price .\nAnd I don \u2019 t say that to be an alarmist.\n\u201d Here Shah grins wildly but does not elaborate .\nReturning to another constant theme\u2014the menace of Fox News\u2014Shah laments : I wonder if it has occurred to her that these people are , in fact , being very kind by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV despite the fact that she used that chance to say very stupid things .\nTroye , whose last job in government was as an advisor to Mike Pence , has thoughts on the state of the media too : At the panel \u2019 s conclusion , an audience member asks : \u201c What are you doing with regard to the traditional Republican establishment , the business community ?\nBecause I \u2019 ve got a bunch of roommates in various things and places , and these people are totally functioning , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worrying about their economy , their next quarter profits , their this , their that\u2014but they are the drivers or have been historically the drivers in this party , and we need to get back to them.\n\u201d This guy must be well into his 60s , so I really hope for his sake that \u201c former \u201d is implicit in his mention of his roommates .\nVillalba \u2019 s answer is better than I could have hoped : \u201c I think you \u2019 re exactly right .\nHistorically , that \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what it means to be a conservative Republican : support lower regulation , lower taxes that benefit the business community .\nThere \u2019 s a recent animus against business that we \u2019 re seeing eke into the narrative .\nAnd it \u2019 s disturbing , frankly , I mean , this idea that big business is bad , we should dictate to big tech , or big oil , or big whatever , how they should run , that \u2019 s even more fascist than it is a free democracy focusing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage to say the best thing I \u2019 ve heard from that podium all weekend : \u201c We \u2019 re going to take the full hour for lunch.\n\u201d I \u2019 ve told myself I \u2019 m not going to smoke , but there \u2019 s a cigar on the menu called the Hemingway Short Story and I figure this must be some kind of sign .\nI \u2019 ve also told myself\u2014have been telling myself for years\u2014that I don \u2019 t actually like cigars .\nBut it \u2019 s very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour has passed and then some .\nI get back just in time to hear Barbara Comstock\u2014who served two terms representing Virginia \u2019 s 10th district in the House\u2014proudly announce , \u201c Obviously I \u2019 m very active and involved with making sure that Liz Cheney is reelected.\n\u201d She denounces the post-Comstock GOP as a \u201c cult \u201d overtaken by a \u201c cancer.\n\u201d But she is not willing to leave it behind for one simple reason : \u201c I was here first.\n\u201d Comstock says the party needs to move away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d apparently missing the irony of this coming from a 62-year-old white woman .\nShe follows this with a potshot at \u201c those horrible candidates in Ohio , \u201d lumping J.D .\nVance together with Josh Mandel .\nWhen asked what a renewed Republican agenda might look like , Comstock answers : \u201c Free markets , free minds\u2026having international relationships\u2026a strong relationship with Israel\u2026 \u201d Joe Walsh , likewise briefly a U.S. representative , is much more willing to cut bait .\n\u201c Liz Cheney\u2014wonderful , \u201d Walsh says .\n\u201c G-d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she \u201c doesn \u2019 t have a prayer \u201d in the GOP after Trump .\nHe has little faith in the base : \u201c You talk to Republican voters on the ground .\nThey \u2019 re not where Barbara is .\nThey \u2019 re not where Miles [ Taylor ] is .\nThey \u2019 re not where I am.\n\u201d Having ridden the Tea Party wave to Congress a dozen years ago , Walsh now says , \u201c Talking to these people , these Tea Party people every day still , the vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishes they were more like him and his companions : \u201c I love all of us up here .\nI love all of you out there .\nBut this is about the voters .\nThey \u2019 re not you.\n\u201d The moderator , failed Texas congressional candidate Michael Wood , says the purpose of the movement is to \u201c keep Donald Trump from ever being in control of nuclear weapons , \u201d which is an odd point of concern regarding the most dovish president at least since Jimmy Carter .\nDescending further into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bernie Sanders will be the Democratic nominee in 2024 .\nTaylor , the Homeland Security chief of staff who , as \u201c Anonymous , \u201d pretended to be a much more senior internal dissident in the Trump administration than he was , self-diagnoses with \u201c clinical Trump derangement syndrome like you wouldn \u2019 t believe.\n\u201d ( This mere weeks after his complaints about \u201c Havana syndrome , \u201d from which Olivia Troye also claimed to suffer . )\nTaylor calls himself a \u201c libertarian-conservative , small-l \u201d and a \u201c classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an \u201c authoritarian.\n\u201d He paints his penning of a New York Times op-ed and subsequent book as some kind of heroic sacrifice : \u201c I paid every price .\nI paid every price , and guess what : I \u2019 d do it again and again.\n\u201d Taylor is either unaware or unwilling to admit that his public profile is now infinitely higher than it was before his publicity-stunt dissidence .\nWood , the ninth-place finisher in a special election last year , closes things out with the observation that \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectuals.\n\u201d He looks back fondly on a time when those intellectuals included men like Irving Kristol , Milton Friedman , Friedrich Hayek , and George Will .\nNow , they are \u201c at best downstream of Patrick Deneen , Sohrab Ahmari , and Yoram Hazony , \u201d and at worst , Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon .\nHe denounces this latter diverse group of thinkers as \u201c post-liberal nationalists , \u2018 blood-and-soil \u2019 conservatives.\n\u201d He ascribes to them the claim that \u201c free government leads to weakness \u201d and issues the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them say that to the Ukrainian military.\n\u201d Each word helps explain why Wood left his Texas primary with just 3.2 percent of the vote .\nA panel on Big Tech casts Silicon Valley \u2019 s megacorporations as \u201c the crown jewels of our American economy , \u201d according to AEI \u2019 s James Pethokoukis , who cites \u201c the jobs they create and the money they spend on investment.\n\u201d NetChoice \u2019 s Jennifer Huddleston likewise dismisses criticisms : \u201c There \u2019 s no actual harm being committed .\nI don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt by Amazon Prime.\n\u201d It quickly becomes apparent that the only standard these people are even capable of considering is \u201c consumer welfare , \u201d as if an American could not possibly exist as , say , a worker or a business owner .\nA questioner with a ponytail introduces himself as a former head of ads privacy at Google who \u2019 s running for Congress in California .\nHe \u2019 s not happy with the panelists , explaining that those who object to Silicon Valley \u2019 s iron grip on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c the marketplace of ideas.\n\u201d He then raises the problem of data privacy , arguing that users own their own data and so should have control over its use .\nHuddleston disagrees , explaining that user data has no inherent value , and \u201c what makes the data valuable is what they are able to do with that data.\n\u201d I wonder where she thinks the value of , well , all other property comes from .\nThe next panel is moderated by Bill Kristol , and one woman gives him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s thin as a rail with short silver hair , and for a moment I worry that she \u2019 s going to fall over .\nHer hero , never much of a right-winger , has lurched noticeably leftward still .\nThe key question , as he sees it , is simply \u201c how to fight the fight for liberal democracy more broadly.\n\u201d If Republicans won \u2019 t help us in that fight , then maybe it \u2019 s time to back \u201c a centrist Democrat who is in favor of\u2014willing to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oddly enough , a candidate \u2019 s willingness to stand up for the people of the United States is not brought up at all .\nKristol says he \u2019 s heartened by the amount of \u201c fresh thinking going on on the center left , \u201d then concedes after a moment \u2019 s pause , \u201c \u2026and the center right.\n\u201d In a Bill Kristol moment that couldn \u2019 t be made up , the ever-eager neocon observes that after Putin \u2019 s invasion there are \u201c more dangers perhaps , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Bulwark \u2019 s Mona Charen is likewise hopeful that all those civilian deaths will turn things back toward hawkishness .\n\u201c After the attack on Pearl Harbor , \u201d she points out , \u201c the America First movement\u2026just faded away , \u201d concluding that it \u2019 s \u201c feasible to imagine , in the wake of Putin \u2019 s naked aggression , a similar rethinking will take place.\n\u201d She ties the Republican realignment together with Putin \u2019 s hyper-nationalism , presenting both as indicative of a \u201c drift toward authoritarianism.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the age of the Big Lie.\n\u201d We live in a time when conservatives believe \u201c that Democrats are not just the opposition but a mortal threat to their way of life.\n\u201d ( Surely they have not been given any good reasons to think so . )\nWe even live in an age when a majority of conservatives tell pollsters that what Charen calls the \u201c assault on democracy \u201d was \u201c not that big a deal.\n\u201d The solution is not to consider the priorities of voters , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for liberty , we \u2019 re for democracy , we \u2019 re for human rights , and they are on the other side.\n\u201d What \u2019 s more , Joe Biden has to take the opportunity to go global , to announce that \u201c it is about defending democracy for ourselves and for the free world.\n\u201d Charen declares , \u201c Our challenge going forward is to unmask the deceivers.\n\u201d She closes with a Lincoln quote : \u201c The dogmas of the quiet past , are inadequate to the stormy present .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we must rise with the occasion .\nAs our case is new , so we must think anew , and act anew .\nWe must disenthrall ourselves , and then we shall save our country.\n\u201d Has Mona Charen ever heard of irony ?\nCathy Young , meanwhile , accuses those who are not prepared for nuclear winter of \u201c bucking the general , massive pro-Ukraine public opinion which rejects the naked aggression from Russia.\n\u201d She calls the move away from Russia-hawkishness \u201c mind-boggling to anyone who was stuck in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d which in my estimation is Young and just about everyone in the room .\nYoung\u2014the second person to do so at the conference\u2014mentions TAC contributing editor Sohrab Ahmari as someone who has committed the cardinal sin of rejecting her preferred liberal consensus .\nShe extends her condemnation to all those who attempt an \u201c outrageous moral equivalency \u201d between Russia and the United States .\nA special shout-out is given to The American Conservative , which Young says ( with disgust ) \u201c is very much in the anti-NATO camp.\n\u201d At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worries that neoconservatives and neoliberals will be blamed for destabilizing the world , for decades of ill-conceived policy that led inevitably to this point .\nCathy , you might be on to something\u2026 Charlie Sykes , also of the Bulwark , claims the crisis in Europe is somehow about \u201c whether or not the West has lost its self-confidence.\n\u201d He denounces Canadian truckers who protested government overreach in their own country , who \u201c imagined that they were taking this bold stand against tyranny and oppression , \u201d as \u201c completely ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why , except to suggest that their attention might have been better focused on Keev instead of Ottawa .\nI settle back into my seat to hear Kinzinger speak for ( now ) the second time in public .\nHe focuses on January 6 .\nDoing his best Fox Mulder impression , the congressman promises , \u201c The truth is out there.\n\u201d He speculates that \u201c if these people knew the plans better it would have been a very different day , \u201d though that claim is hardly borne out by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rioters only low-level vandalism , some minor brawling , and a lot of selfie action .\nYet Kinzinger makes some concessions to the mob : \u201c If I truly believed that the election system in this country was rigged by Satan-worshipping pedophiles who drink babies \u2019 blood , I don \u2019 t think I \u2019 d go gently into the night either.\n\u201d Well\u2026 He makes some political promises , too : \u201c We will not be the first generation in American history that leaves our kids a country that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d This is likely to be true , if only because they \u2019 re going to be the second .\nThen\u2014we all knew it was coming\u2014he turns his eyes to Keev .\n\u201c By the way , \u201d he tells us , \u201c as I was driving in here , there was convoys of people with Ukrainian flags honking their horns .\nAnd I didn \u2019 t know what was going on , and then I was pretty excited.\n\u201d He reminds America that \u201c had we forgotten our mission in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few decades the global situation would have turned out very differently .\nI wouldn \u2019 t dare to argue with him there .\nHe says the standard is

Capitol by outraged supporters of President Donald Trump on January 6 , 2021 , the growth of political intolerance in the United States has reached toxic levels .\nTrump \u2019 s adversaries immediately branded the incident as an insurrection and accused the lame duck president of trying to stage a coup to invalidate the results of the 2020 election .\nLos Angeles Times columnist Doyle McManus warned , in a column headlined \u201c Warning : Jan. 6 was not a one-time event , \u201d that Trump and his right-wing backers might use similar tactics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions , both the mainstream legacy media and the newer social media powerhouses fully embraced the \u201c insurrection \u201d narrative .\nProponents of that narrative also engaged in a concerted effort to silence Trump and key supporters and denigrate anyone who continued to support his allegations of vote fraud .\nTwitter and Facebook moved to terminate Trump \u2019 s access to their platforms , as well as the accounts of several of his advisers and prominent supporters .\nIt was an extraordinary display of raw politicized power .\nTwo private companies had successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEven ordinary Americans who participated in the much larger peaceful rally on the National Mall that preceded the riot soon found themselves targeted for retaliation .\nPaul Davis , an attorney from Texas , was fired from his position when he was identified as having attended the rally , even though there was no evidence that he engaged in the violence at the Capitol .\nOther people reported experiencing similar retaliation for activity that is explicitly protected under the First Amendment .\nFrequently , statements justifying punitive responses merely asserted that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near \u201d the Capitol on that day\u2014not that they had illegally entered the building .\nSome demonstrators even reported menacing visits from FBI investigators in the following weeks and months .\nIt is indisputable that the FBI was scrutinizing several extreme right-wing organizations and their members , and the definition of \u201c extreme \u201d seemed to be expanding .\nMedia efforts to blur the distinction between peaceful protesters and rioters continued .\nA New York Times story typified that tactic .\n\u201c In the year since the attack , many [ protestors ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiracy theories sown in the bloody chaos of that day , \u201d it stated .\nTypically , the Times profile focused on one man who expressed regrets that more people had not brought weapons to the Mall rally .\nThe growing authoritarian behavior characterizing the self-proclaimed defenders of democracy is more than a little worrying .\nThe social media platforms not only barred speech that advocated or seemed to advocate violence , they targeted websites and posts that dared to argue that vote fraud had occurred in the 2020 presidential election , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message and the rationale for the rally at the Mall .\nLeading Democrats enthusiastically endorsed the decisions to bar such messages and suspend or close the media accounts of Trump and his followers .\nUnder Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2019 s direction , the House of Representatives created a select committee to investigate the January 6 events , a committee that Democrats utterly dominated along with token neoconservative Republicans Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger .\nPredictably , the investigation soon became a fishing expedition to \u201c prove \u201d that the January 6 episode constituted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow House members who had worked with organizers of the National Mall rally or asserted that vote fraud had taken place .\nSuch an intimidating , politicized investigation was troubling , since even considering the January 6 events an insurrection required a sizable stretch of the concept .\nTrump \u2019 s extended effort to challenge Joe Biden \u2019 s election exacerbated already alarming societal divisions , and it reflected a sore loser mentality .\nNevertheless , his challenge took the form of lawsuits and efforts to persuade Congress to invalidate the electoral vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case was unconvincing and would have set a terrible precedent if his strategy had succeeded .\nIt would have been far better if he had never embarked on such an ill-advised course .\nBut there is no credible evidence that Trump or his associates advocated violence or other illegal measures .\nMoreover , despite the riot at the Capitol , there were no tanks in the streets , armed assaults on multiple governmental institutions , or efforts to either seize or shut down the news media\u2014the cardinal features of a true insurrection .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 800 people , the vast majority of whom were unarmed .\nIt was a nasty riot that disgraced the participants and the cause they purported to represent , but it did not constitute an insurrection .\nA recent public opinion survey confirms that a majority of Americans rightly reject the use of the insurrection label to describe the confrontation .\nFor a stridently vocal faction in America \u2019 s increasingly polarized political system , though , it has not been enough to castigate the rioters for their disgraceful , indefensible conduct .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Justice Department prosecute the individuals involved for trespass , assault , and other crimes .\nOver the past year , Joe Biden \u2019 s administration and its congressional allies have adopted multiple policies that assume that the inflammatory allegation of an insurrection is indisputable and that America faces a serious domestic terrorist threat to its democratic system .\nIronically , their policies pose the real threat to democracy and fundamental constitutional liberties .\nThe attempt to intimidate dissenters and delegitimize dissent on issues important to the progressive woke brigade accelerated dramatically in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anniversary of the January 6 riot .\nInsistence on portraying the episode as an outright insurrection acquired new fervor as did demands that the Biden administration take more vigorous action against \u201c domestic terrorism , \u201d a concept that proponents of a crackdown rarely defined with any precision .\nThe Atlantic published a special issue on \u201c American democracy in crisis \u201d and warned that \u201c January 6 was practice \u201d for a better organized coup attempt by right-wing elements following the next presidential election .\nSuch threat inflation has become far too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some dangerously destructive attitudes and policies .\nEven before January 6 , a growing intolerance toward unorthodox views already had produced alarming hostility toward dissenting ideas on a growing array of issues .\nThose abuses were evident regarding two prominent issues in 2020 .\nOne was the concerted attempt by powerful figures in the scientific community ( many with compromising financial ties to China \u2019 s government ) together with gatekeepers in both the legacy news media and the newer social media platforms to smear and silence individuals who asserted that the Covid-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Wuhan Institute of Virology .\nThe other abuse was the even more ideologically driven and starkly partisan campaign to suppress news stories and prevent discussion of incriminating documents found on a laptop allegedly lost by Hunter Biden , documents that appeared to implicate his father in potentially corrupt dealings with foreign governments .\nThe politicized nature of the effort to suppress the lab leak thesis became glaringly evident when media outlets abruptly ended their bans .\nThat reversal coincided precisely with the Biden administration \u2019 s decision in late May 2021 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which the White House had terminated shortly after Biden \u2019 s inauguration ) into the origins of Covid .\nFacebook lifted its ban on posts touting the theory as soon as the administration announced the new investigation .\nConservatives expressed grim satisfaction that its perspective on the issue was now acknowledged as legitimate , but they also voiced anger at ideological opponents who had smothered meaningful debate on such an important topic .\nWall Street Journal columnist Holman W. Jenkins Jr. asked pointedly , \u201c On what basis was the lab leak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media despite the lack of any evidence or logic for ruling it out ?\n\u201d His answer was provocative and unsettling .\n\u201c We in the press dismissed the lab theory because of an appeal to authority : When anti-Donald Trump spokespeople ridiculed it , that was good enough for us.\n\u201d The attempts to stifle discussion of the Hunter Biden laptop episode were even more brazen .\nLegacy media outlets formed a solid bloc asserting that the scandal was a Russian disinformation campaign , although even the Trump-phobic FBI concluded there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Review \u2019 s David Harsanyi charged ( with good reason ) , \u201c \u2018 Russian disinformation \u2019 has become the single laziest , dumbest , and most cynical rationalization for journalistic malpractice and political activism over the last four years.\n\u201d Nevertheless , the verbal assault on those who dared foster discussion of the laptop issue was pervasive .\nFacebook and Twitter took the extraordinary step of blocking access to the New York Post articles that initially broke the story .\nTwitter went so far as to temporarily suspend the newspaper \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House press secretary , who had favorably cited those reports of the laptop scandal .\nThe few journalists or other analysts who had the temerity to take the New York Post stories seriously and suggest that they deserved investigation and discussion faced shrill hostility .\nAn implicit media\u2013Democratic alliance acted as protectors of Joe Biden and his presidential campaign , in the process subverting debate on an important issue and suppressing a minority view .\nIn January 2022 , the Biden administration and its congressional allies took several especially menacing actions .\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would create a new unit focused on the alleged threat of domestic terrorism .\nGiven the ravages already done to First Amendment and Fourth Amendment rights under the Patriot Act and other measures adopted in response to the 9/11 attacks and the frequently inflated foreign terrorist threat , this latest development is cause for concern .\nThe Justice Department under Attorney General Merrick Garland already has shown that it embraces an extremely vague definition of what constitutes domestic terrorism .\nIn response to a letter from the National School Boards Association ( actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization ) in October 2021 , Garland authorized the FBI to investigate parents who engaged in confrontational behavior at local school board meetings .\nIt is a safe bet that not even the biggest advocates of the Patriot Act in 2001 envisioned that application of the law .\nThe potential for a Justice Department domestic terrorism unit to have a chilling effect on freedom of expression is extensive .\nIndeed , the move evokes memories of the FBI \u2019 s infamous COINTELPRO initiative during the Cold War .\nUnder J. Edgar Hoover \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harassed antiwar and civil rights organizations .\nInformants and undercover agents repeatedly sought to manipulate those movements into engaging in violence and other conduct that would discredit their causes with the general public .\nWe must guard against a repetition of such sleazy behavior by a government agency .\nYet another troubling Biden administration initiative in January 2022 was the government \u2019 s decision to charge members of the Oath Keepers organization with \u201c seditious conspiracy \u201d regarding the January 6 incident .\nOne can regard that group as repellent for numerous valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice Department \u2019 s action .\nDusting off dangerously vague conspiracy statutes is an extremely ominous move .\nFrom the 1798 Alien and Sedition Acts to the 1918 amendments to the Espionage Act of 1917 ( typically referred to as the Sedition Act ) , to sedition prosecutions directed against accused communist figures during the Cold War , such laws have led to notorious abuses .\nIt is not comforting that several of the Oath Keepers defendants apparently were not even in the Capitol on January 6 , and the specific acts they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nGiven the nation \u2019 s history , we should never want to venture again down the path of using conspiracy and sedition laws ( much less the combination ) to prosecute unpopular dissidents .\nYet that is clearly what the government has in mind .\nA final troubling development is the announcement that social media executives will again be hauled before a congressional committee to explain why they haven \u2019 t done more to squelch \u201c disinformation \u201d on their platforms .\nCongress has engaged in such grandstanding attempts at intimidation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the explicit rationale for the subpoenas that the House Select Committee issued is that the alleged failure to prevent the spread of \u201c falsehoods , misinformation and violent extremism \u201d directly contributed to the January 6 \u201c insurrection.\n\u201d The earlier hearings confirmed that when some members of Congress refer to misinformation , it means any viewpoint on any issue that differs with their perspective on that issue .\nFacebook , Twitter , YouTube , and the other social media giants already have amassed a troubling record of acceding to the wishes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppressed .\nThe prospect of intensified congressional pressure for those organizations to fall into line and suppress views challenging the narrative that the January 6 events constituted a full-fledged insurrection is even more alarming .\nThe latest maneuver is reminiscent of conduct that took place during the 1950s .\nThree separate congressional committees held hearings on possible communist penetration of the news media , and the consequences were decidedly unhealthy .\nOne of the committees , chaired by Sen. James Eastland of Mississippi , compiled a list of more than 500 suspect journalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 100 journalists were subpoenaed and interrogated about suspected ties between the Communist Party and the newspaper industry .\nThe official rationale was to ask reporters and editors about any involvement they had had with the Communist Party .\nBut as historian Edward Alwood documents , during the sessions , \u201c the actual questioning went much further .\nThe committee asked about their political interests and personal thoughts and beliefs .\nMembers questioned newspaper editorial policies and hiring practices , areas that were thought to be sacrosanct under the First Amendment.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the willing compliance throughout the public arena was palpable .\nIt is no coincidence that the 1950s were characterized by a lack of meaningful debate on a wide array of issues\u2014especially aspects of U.S. foreign policy .\nEven mild iconoclasts feared that they could become the target of the next wave of investigations .\nThe prospect of unsupported allegations and outright smears that could cost reputations and livelihoods was ever present , and it was much safer to avoid expressing controversial views .\nAs Alwood points out , numerous journalists and others lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of \u201c subversive \u201d associations or opinions .\nOn some occasions , the trigger took the form of a quiet telephone call from a congressional or executive branch operative to the publication \u2019 s editor \u201c suggesting \u201d termination .\nThe current wave of ideological intolerance fueling congressional investigations and hearings into \u201c disinformation \u201d and January 6 bears more than a small resemblance to that era of smears , intimidation , and constrained debate .\nThere is a growing danger that the January 6 riot is becoming a pretext for an array @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt is imperative for the American people to reject the current campaign of threat inflation and the latest bid for measures that would further erode important constitutional freedoms .\nTed Galen Carpenter , a senior fellow at the Cato Institute , is the author of 12 books

parents\u2014many of whom are using State Rep. Matt Krause \u2019 s list of objectionable books\u2014who want to vouchsafe their children \u2019 s innocence and remove sexually explicit material from their children \u2019 s schools .\nOn the other side are parents , like English professor Shulamith Armintor , who think such books offer solace to students who identify with the experiences depicted .\nCommentators more removed from the matter generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ban .\nFirst , book banning just sounds bad and un-American .\nSecond , they see little point in preserving kids \u2019 innocence anyway .\nChallenging the moral values of young readers still learning to read , they argue , is \u201c exactly what literature is supposed to do.\n\u201d This debate is taking place in the larger context of Republican politicians in Texas investigating the book collections at all public school libraries , banning critical race theory in public school curricula , and encouraging parents to have a greater say in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless played a large role in people \u2019 s positions .\nBut the parents who support the removal of these books make a stronger case .\nThey are right to champion the innocence of children and their right to have a truly safe space to learn about the world without being corrupted by it .\nFurther , the objections to removing such books are logically weak .\nTo begin , to equate removing pornographic books from a school library with undermining the very purpose of literature is to miss the crux of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in question are appropriate for young people .\nPeople aren \u2019 t discussing the literary merits of Toni Morrison \u2019 s Bluest Eye or a biography of Michelle Obama , but whether children and adolescents should be reading something like the graphic novel Gender Queer , which takes readers on a \u201c journey of gender identity and sexual orientation \u201d and includes \u201c a few pages of explicit illustrations depicting oral sex.\n\u201d It is fair to ask whether Gender Queer and other such books offer any educational benefit to students .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this story .\nThey don \u2019 t even get much practice reading , since it \u2019 s a graphic novel .\nMore importantly , narratively , some guy exploring his ( their ? )\nsexuality and gender sounds incredibly dull .\nIt \u2019 s hard to see how the inclusion of Gender Queer amounts to anything but the school library \u2019 s endorsement of LGBTQ ideology and a sexually active lifestyle .\nAll the same , some might see such an endorsement as an entirely appropriate way to help LGBTQ students feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions : Are LGBTQ students being systematically excluded at school ?\nIf they are , would having certain books in a school library really fix this problem ?\nAnd is a school library , rather than a club or organization , the best means of facilitating inclusion ?\nThen there \u2019 s the issue of schools \u201c picking a side , \u201d or excluding others with

players .\nThe firm , known as Volga and owned by the American billionaire Dzheffri Bezosi , has enjoyed a near monopoly in important economic areas , including delivery , web hosting , and cloud computing services for the government .\nThe ties between Bezosi and the Bidenov regime go back more than a decade to the premiership of Barukh Obamsky , under whom Bidenov served as a deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 d Trumanov , the ousted leader of the opposition who was sanctioned by the regime after his exit in January 2021 and continues to face prosecutions from regional allies of the Bidenov regime described by international observers as as worryingly impartial .\nUntil recently , most America watchers had considered Volga impervious to antitrust-related prosecution and other potential violations of federal and state labor laws .\nDespite occasional tension with minor regime officials and frequent criticism from members of the opposition , Volga has been considered to enjoy what independent watchdog groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sectors of the American economy and virtually unprecedented influence in Congress , thanks to extensive lobbying of key politicians , including both regime allies and members of the opposition .\nWhile opposition leaders described Wednesday \u2019 s reports as encouraging , very few think it likely that Volga \u2019 s position will be meaningfully threatened .\nThe announcement of Wednesday \u2019 s actions is further complicated by the fact that the leader of the called-for investigation is Marik Garlanov , whose nomination to the Supreme Court , the regime \u2019 s controversial chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians in Congress during Obamsky \u2019 s premiership\u2026 .\nFor those readers not in on the joke , what really happened on Wednesday was that a bipartisan congressional committee asked Merrick Garland to investigate Amazon for possible criminal obstruction of Congress .\nWhat the lawmakers allege is that during the 16-month inquiry conducted by the House Subcommittee on Antitrust , Commercial , and Administrative Law , which produced a somewhat equivocal report on possible anti-competitive behavior by various

notion of writing \u201c hard \u201d news stories about American politics the same way one might if something similar were happening abroad .\nThere is something valuable about defamiliarizing

country for decades .\nAmazon , like Google and Facebook , is more comparable to one of the quasi-sovereign state-linked firms that dominates industry in Russia or China .\nAs I write this , the resources that any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the event of an actual antitrust prosecution would dwarf the legal forces currently available to the relevant departments of the executive branch .\nWhatever its

that : \u201c Wherever the standard of freedom and independence has been or shall be unfurled , there will [ America \u2019 s ] heart , her benedictions and her prayers be.\n\u201d Quincy Adams was close enough to our Founding , in both proximity of years and in relation to one of the key Founders , to fully understand that those of the Revolutionary generation were united in their belief that avoiding entangling alliances and the perpetual war scene of Europe was a necessary precondition for the preservation of liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Founders expressed their desire to have questions of war decided by the collective wisdom of Congress and not by the whims of a single President .\nMadison wrote that the executive branch was the branch most likely to engage in war and , therefore , the drafters of the Constitution deliberately vested that power in the legislature .\nThese sentiments still ring true to many libertarians , who believe that war should be the last resort , that war should only be fought with a formal congressional declaration , and that America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons and daughters to be sacrificed in every war on the planet , even when the call for war is sought by fellow aspirants for liberty .\nBut it \u2019 s important to clarify that the heart of Quincy Adams\u2014as well as many modern-day libertarians , including myself\u2014aligns with freedom seekers around the globe .\nI have not one shred of sympathy for aggressor nations who invade and pillage adjoining countries .\nNone .\nA policy of restraint can argue simultaneously that admitting Ukraine into NATO is foolishly provocative and that Russia \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ultimately will be destructive both to Ukraine and to Russia herself .\nWith Putin \u2019 s invasion , Russia lost much of its moral and persuasive power to keep Ukraine out of NATO .\nNow , Russia might argue that occupying Ukraine will keep that country out of NATO .\nPerhaps , but at what cost ?\nDoes Putin really believe that conquering Kiev will end the war ?\nDoes Putin really believe the Ukrainians will simply accept an occupation ?\nI foresee a protracted insurgency with the very real possibility of @ @ @

Ukrainian nationalists from sabotaging the pipeline .\nLike Quincy Adams , our hearts reach out to those who unfurl the banner of liberty and defend their homeland .\nOur sentiments and sympathy ,

propped up for 20 years by the American military and trillions of American dollars , cut and ran once the U.S. withdrew .\nThe Afghan national government ultimately conceded defeat with barely a whimper .\nThe mujahideen , and later the Taliban , fought against first the Soviets and then the Americans .\nDespite vastly superior firepower , two superpowers ultimately limped away , and Afghans are once again free of foreign \u201c occupiers.\n\u201d Russia may be able to defeat Ukraine militarily , but they will ultimately fail if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to freedom fighters everywhere , go our

"The ruling-class talking point du jour is that Russia \u2019 s war in Ukraine has dealt a crushing blow to Western populists .\nThe populists , according to this view , tied their fate to Vladimir Putin \u2019 s : whether by praising him , calling for more genial relations with Moscow , turning a blind eye to Kremlin depravities , or some combination of the above .\nNow that Putin has launched a failed invasion of Ukraine\u2014failed according to Twitter and feverish media wish-casters , at least\u2014his populist fan club is also tainted by his cruelty and incompetence .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , \u201d as a headline in UnHerd put it .\nIt \u2019 s pure poppycock , but before I explain why , let \u2019 s briefly pause to note the sheer grotesqueness of this ideological posturing at this moment .\nAmid the carnage wrought in Ukraine by Moscow \u2019 s aggression , the suffering of ordinary Russians under Western sanctions , and the anxiety that grips Europe as a whole , the liberal establishment sees fit to cashier misery into point-scoring against their domestic political opponents .\nThis is the business we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fair enough\u2014but then kindly stop whinging about civility , decency , and unity .\nAs to the charge itself , it is built on a foundation of deliberate misunderstandings , misdirections , and outright slanders .\nWhile some of the criticisms might apply to some populists , they don \u2019 t apply to others .\nYet the liberal columnists \u2019 underhanded tactic is to barrage all populists with all the charges , to see what sticks .\nThere are different versions of this , offered variously by William Galston in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaufmann in the aforementioned UnHerd piece , and Francis Fukuyama and Janan Ganesh in essays for the Financial Times .\nLet \u2019 s attempt to unpack three of the main strands : One charge is that Western populists fetishized Putin as an emblem of strongman confidence and now must \u201c own \u201d the logistical setbacks and military snafus dogging the Russian army on its path to conquest .\nThis was the line taken by Ganesh : \u201c While liberals get lost in the bureaucratic and legislative fog , the autocrat supposedly cuts through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u2019 said Trump of the US ) .\nWhile the one thinks wishfully , the other grasps the eternal verities of power and strategy.\n\u201d If Russia had easily subdued Ukraine , populists \u201c would now , in that phoney I-hate-to-say-it tone , be urging their own societies to learn from the guile and virility of the illiberal world.\n\u201d Ganesh curiously didn \u2019 t quote any actual populists praising Putin \u2019 s mythic competence , but let \u2019 s generously concede that one Donald J. Trump has hailed the Russian leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe question becomes : competence in relation to what ends , given what conditions ?\nAssume for argument \u2019 s sake that the NATO-ization of Ukraine is an existential threat to the Russian state .\nIf so , then even a costly , messy invasion , mounted by a wounded former superpower with an economy the size of Spain \u2019 s , is effective enough if it in fact forestalls NATO-ization .\nPutin \u2019 s desired outcome may yet come to pass .\nHe achieved Russia \u2019 s goals in Georgia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than can be said for U.S. strategists with respect to their goals in Afghanistan .\nAfter 20 years , the Taliban took back power , while the Western alliance \u2019 s 300,000-strong Afghan army collapsed .\nBut there is another point here : If \u201c autocratic \u201d incompetence humiliates Western populists , as Ganesh suggests , it should equally embarrass plenty of blue-chip liberals who have waxed about a nondemocratic regime \u2019 s ability to get things done .\nRemember Tom Friedman in 2010 ?\n\u201c What if we could just be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just , just , just one day .\nYou know , I mean , where we could actually , you know , authorize the right solutions , and I do think there is a sense of that , on , on everything from the economy to environment ?\n\u201d Or how about Justin Trudeau in 2013 ?\n\u201c There is a level of admiration I actually have for China because their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say we need to go green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , investing in solar.\n\u201d The examples abound .\nLiberals as much as Western populists , then , must \u201c own \u201d the failures of a nondemocratic regime\u2014which is another way of saying this is a ludicrous line of attack .\nAnother argument is that populists advance an \u201c anti-Western foreign policy , \u201d born of their \u201c hostility to the rules-based liberal world order.\n\u201d That was the line taken by Kaufmann , who says he would prefer populists like Tucker Carlson and J.D .\nVance to temper their anti-woke energies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues\u2014not against elites in \u201c Davos , Geneva , or Brussels , \u201d which , he reassures , aren \u2019 t that woke .\nHe should know , \u201c having given talks at some of these institutions.\n\u201d Or something .\nHis commitments are a jumbled mess .\nThe bigger problem here is circular reasoning .\nKaufmann assumes that opposing hawkism and escalation makes one \u201c anti-Western.\n\u201d Pro-Western-ness is thus defined at the outset as a preference for the foreign policies of the liberal imperium and its marquee institutions .\nTherefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et al .\nare lamentably anti-Western .\nBut this is to beg the question .\nCarlson and his populist confreres argue that hawkism is inimical to the interests of ordinary people in the West and , if escalated to a nuclear point of no return , to the survival of humanity at large .\nThey are defining Western-ness differently than self-identified liberals , in other words , and judging by the record of liberal interventionism the past 20 years , such a redefinition is sorely needed .\nFinally , there is the outright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cruelties .\nIt was lamentable to see this line taken up by Galston , someone I have often disagreed with but couldn \u2019 t fault for lack of probity in debate .\nGalston tsk-tsked Carlson for a recent monologue in which the Fox primetime host prompted Americans to ask themselves : \u201c Has Putin ever called me a racist ?\nHas he ever threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him ?\n\u201d Contra Galston , it is an uncharitable stretch to suggest that those questions amount to \u201c defending Vladimir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s point , as Galston probably knows , isn \u2019 t that Putin is wonderful , but that after two decades of failed foreign adventurism , it behooves Americans to confront the monsters within our own order : a rapacious domestic overclass that has wrought inequality , health insecurity , opioid misery , stagnant wages , cultural degradation\u2014and increasingly resorts to technological censorship to deal with popular discontent .\nThe establishment may yet succeed in hanging Putin like an albatross round the necks of its internal enemies .\nBut doing so won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crises .\nThen again , maybe that is the point .", "author": "Sohrab Ahmari", "url":

normally a routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the leadership of the Federal Reserve , our central bank .\nCharged with controlling inflation and fostering employment , the Fed has recently taken steps to expand into new arenas : fighting climate change and promoting social justice .\nThe Senate confirmation process has come to a head over Biden nominee Sarah Bloom Raskin , who GOP senators say is too radical in her antipathy toward oil producers to serve as the Fed \u2019 s chief bank regulator .\nMeanwhile , legal analysts say the Fed is stepping outside of its mandate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activists look longingly at the Bank of England and the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which have explicit mandates to support a transition to green energy , as models for America \u2019 s banking system .\nEuropean central banks enact an environmental agenda through mechanisms such as \u201c Green Quantitative Easing , \u201d using taxpayer funds to finance green companies and projects .\nIn addition , there has been a push for central banks to leverage their supervisory control over private banks and to penalize them for lending to so-called \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c green capital requirements , \u201d which make such loans more expensive for banks to issue .\nRaskin criticized America \u2019 s regulators in September 2021 for not \u201c thinking creatively \u201d about how to combat climate change the way other central banks have done : \u201c Their reluctance stands in stark contrast to financial regulators in other rich countries , where policies and processes are being reimagined to accelerate a rapid , orderly and just transition to a renewable , biodiverse , and sustainable economy.\n\u201d The Fed , Raskin argued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c transition away from high-emission and biodiversity-destroying investments.\n\u201d For this and other reasons , Republican Senators have thus far refused to confirm Raskin .\nIn addition , 24 state treasurers and financial officers have formed a coalition to oppose Raskin \u2019 s confirmation for her support of social causes over economic issues .\n\u201c Ms .\nRaskin \u2019 s repeated and forceful advocacy for having the Federal Reserve allocate capital and choke off credit to disfavored industries is alone disqualifying , \u201d said Pat Toomey , the top Republican on the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central

Stability Climate Committee and a Supervision Climate Committee .\nFed Governor Lael Brainard stated in October 2021 that the Fed should get in lockstep with other central banks regarding climate issues .\nThe Fed should \u201c provide supervisory guidance for large banking institutions in their efforts to appropriately measure , monitor and manage material climate-related risks , following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries , \u201d Brainard said .\nBut many Fed-watchers question the wisdom and legality of using our central bank to pursue political goals , particularly at a time of fuel crisis and escalating inflation .\nThe Fed \u2019 s authority was defined by Congress in the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and the 1933 Banking Act as aimed towards maintaining price stability , supporting full employment , and ensuring the \u201c safety and soundness \u201d of the banking system .\n\u201c The progressive movement has always used emotional arguments to undermine the rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of law as limiting them , \u201d former Fed official and financial analyst Chris Whalen said .\n\u201c They tend to take these agencies and bend them to their specific wants and needs.\n\u201d \u201c There \u2019 s legal legitimacy and there \u2019 s also democratic legitimacy problems here , \u201d said central bank analyst and Wharton Business School professor Christina Parajon Skinner .\n\u201c People want to use the Fed to increase the carrot-and-stick of regulation to deter banks from lending to \u2018 brown \u2019 companies and to incentivize them to lend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is doing this broadly , and that is the primary reason that the administrative state is in a legitimacy crisis.\n\u201d Similar to efforts by the Biden administration to impose vaccine mandates on employers through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration , which was struck down by the Supreme Court , progressives are attempting to push other agencies including the Fed to go beyond their mandate in pursuit of a political agenda .\nBut by contrast to other central banks , the Fed is unique because of its explicit independence from the Presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going back more than a century .\nPoliticizing the Fed not only compromises its independence but raises questions about Constitutional separation of powers .\n\u201c If they want to outlaw fossil fuels , which is essentially the same thing as denying them access to capital , then Congress has to pass a law , \u201d Skinner said .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no end in sight once you start opening up the Fed in this way.\n\u201d Accessing capital through loans and bonds is a critical issue for America \u2019 s energy producers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fossil fuels comes with enormous fixed costs and long lead times before oil and gas projects can come on line .\nThe threat of climate-based scrutiny by agencies such as the Fed \u201c has scared off investors tremendously , \u201d said Daniel Turner , executive director of Power the Future .\n\u201c For the first time we have Fed nominees who are targeting specific industries as punishable.\n\u201d Before oil and gas companies even start drilling , they must invest tens of

economics standpoint for the oil industry to ramp up production , \u201d said Ed Yardeni , former Fed economist and president of Yardeni Research .\n\u201c But the climate activists certainly have run ragged over the energy industry with regulatory policies promoted as executive orders by the President from day one of this administration.\n\u201d The fossil fuel producers \u201c are not going to increase production , not going to spend money and capital equipment to find and process more oil , \u201d Yardeni said .\n\u201c The result is a supply shortage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices and their cash flow will be great and they \u2019 ll pay out more dividends.\n\u201d Increasingly , Europe looks more like a cautionary tale than an example to follow .\n\u201c There is no country in the world that has embraced a green agenda successfully , \u201d Turner said .\n\u201c Germany is the poster child .\nThey \u2019 re 20 years ahead of us in terms of punishing the fossil fuel industry and the nuclear industry and embracing this radical green philosophy.\n\u201d Where Americans paid on average 11 cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans paid more than three times that amount , and their costs have sharply escalated since .\nHaving shut down their nuclear industry on false hopes that green energy would fill the gap , Germany is now dependent on Russian oil and gas for a third of their energy and their carbon emissions are higher today than they were 20 years ago .\n\u201c If Americans understood that this is the direction where we \u2019 re headed , they would fight back hard , \u201d Turner said .\n\u201c If the Europeans think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissions ] , they are badly mistaken , \u201d Whalen said .\n\u201c There \u2019 s going to be a critical shortage not only for cars but for fertilizer as well , \u201d the majority component of which is oil .\nThe crisis in Ukraine will likely affect not only energy but food and every other industry that uses oil , including plastic .\nThe Fed also plans to take on social issues beyond climate change .\nIn August 2020 , the Fed announced that its employment mandate would be expanded to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure that \u201c maximum employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal.\n\u201d How they would pursue such a goal is unclear .\nTimes have changed , however , and the struggle for the Fed today is not only with climate change and social justice but with its core mandate of fighting inflation , which is fast approaching double digits .\nMany observers question whether the Fed has the will or the independence to hike rates enough to control inflation .\nTo tame double-digit inflation in the 1970s , interest rates rose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the 1.5 percent rate increases that markets are expectingfrom the Fed this year .\nAs consumer inflation exceeded 7 percent and wholesale prices hit 10 percent , the Fed dropped the Biden administration \u2019 s mantra that inflation was \u201c transitory.\n\u201d \u201c Right now , the reality is that inflation is not only persistent but it \u2019 s getting persistently worse , \u201d Yardeni said .\n\u201c The Fed has really lost control of the inflation mandate.\n\u201d The Fed \u2019 s only real weapon to fight inflation is raising interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden \u2019 s spending agenda by increasing borrowing costs , and any rate hikes that put the U.S. into a recession could affect the upcoming Congressional elections and Biden \u2019 s re-election prospects in 2024 .\nWhile some at the Fed will continue to prioritize climate-change , Whalen said his experience at the Fed leads him to expect that Chairman Jerome Powell will push social issues to the back burner and focus on inflation once he is confirmed by the Senate .\nConsequently , Powell \u2019 s confirmation is now being opposed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c In a fairly short time , economic reality is going to take over this conversation , \u201d Whalen said .\nFacing inflation and fallout from the war in Ukraine , he predicts that the Fed \u2019 s social justice initiatives \u201c will slide into the background.\n\u201d Raskin , during last week \u2019 s confirmation hearing , backpedaled on her earlier endorsement of Fed social activism , stating that \u201c it is inappropriate for the Fed to make credit decisions .\nBanks choose their borrowers , not the Fed.\n\u201d Noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sen. Toomey responded that \u201c this is one of the most remarkable cases of confirmation conversion I have ever seen.\n\u201d Absent a dramatic change in his administration \u2019 s domestic energy policies , Biden may be forced to cut a deal to import Iranian oil soon and may even be forced to reauthorize construction of the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada , which could have brought 850,000 barrels of oil to the U.S. per day , compared to the 672,000 barrels per day we imported from Russia in 2021 .\n\u201c There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more progressive Fed , \u201d Yardeni said , \u201c but I \u2019 m not sure Chairman Powell wants to go there .\nThe Fed is clearly behind the inflation curve and needs to address that issue without getting itself into the morass of climate change policy.\n\u201d The Federal Reserve was asked to comment on this article but has not provided a response .\nKevin Stocklin is a writer , film director , and founder of Second Act Films , an independent production house specializing in educational media and feature films .", "author": "Kevin Stocklin", "url": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/fed-goes-green-as-oil-and-inflation-spike/", "published": "Tue, 15 Mar 2022 04:01:09 +0000", "published_utc": 1647331269, "collection_utc": 1647342351}, {"id": "theamericanconservative--2022-03-16--Orders of Political Operations", "date": "2022-03-16", "source": "theamericanconservative", "title": "Orders of Political Operations", "content": "Please excuse my dear Aunt Sally .\nMost of us learned that mnemonic device at some point in our mathematical education .\nCalculations must be done in an appropriate succession to reflect distributive and associative properties .\nSo , PEMDAS : parentheses , exponents , multiplication , division , addition , subtraction .\nMath has an order of operations .\nSo does political life .\nCertain policy spheres condition others .\nSome political decisions suggest or forestall others .\nPolitics is the art of the possible , where necessity and fortune are wrestled with by prudence .\nIt is itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of language and tradition , and nature , in the form of human beings and geography .\nAs with the rules or principles of any game , the more thoroughly a statesman comprehends the limits of political choice the more freedom he actually has , able to act with confidence , avoiding obstacles .\nThe first step in the order of political operations is foreign policy and immigration .\nJust as parentheses are grouping symbols that indicate what is to be treated as a unit and what will interact with that unit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy delimit the nation from the world , and bound the domestic sphere .\nNo reformation or renaissance in political life here at home is possible without recognition of this fact .\nJust as ignoring parentheses in a mathematical calculation will produce a wrong answer , so too have 30 years of American policymakers ignoring borders both here and abroad in pursuit of global liberal empire resulted in harm to American citizens .\nAs we pray for a swift resolution of the Russia-Ukraine war so that there might be minimal loss of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have learned anything from those long decades of schooling .\nNo .\nThe expansion of NATO ever eastward ignored the bounds of Russian influence and interest , seeking to divide Europe from Russia , nuclear exponents be damned .\nWhen the predictable happened , and Russia invaded Ukraine\u2014while normal Americans have hoped for peace and wished Ukrainian citizens well\u2014our leaders have seen the chance to punish the Russian people and weaken Vladimir Putin by protracting the conflict , turning Ukraine into a Syria or Afghanistan , treating dead Ukrainians as just a function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic consequences of subtracting Russian resources out of order .\nSenators who have talked big game about domestic reforms have shown themselves ignorant of this sort of basic math .\nAn American foreign policy directed towards liberal hegemony conditions the political status quo .\nU.S. sanctions and flirtation with further material involvement in the Russia conflict continue that .\nYou can not give speeches in praise of industrial policy and the restoration of an economy transformed by globalism and then turn to work for the perpetuation of the global superstructure that created the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all that , the local politics of Washington , D.C. , remains dominated by the military industrial complex warned of by President Dwight D.

the U.S.-Mexico border since Russia \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine began , and the Biden administration \u2019 s response has been to pour gasoline on a powder keg .\nJes\u00fas Alejandro Ruiz Uribe , a federal delegate for the Mexican state of Baja California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have arrived in Tijuana and the surrounding area since the Russian invasion began on February 24 .\nRuiz Uribe added that most of the Ukrainian migrants have not requested to stay in public or private shelters , and are well-off enough to pay for their own housing , transportation , and other expenses incurred over the course of their attempt to get into the United States .\nBefore these Ukrainians head north to the San Ysidro Port of Entry on the U.S. border , they are reportedly arriving in Mexico through the airports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mexican government is providing them with six-month tourist visas .\nThe Biden administration is reportedly attempting to devise a strategy to fast-track Ukrainian asylum seekers on

million people with Ukrainian ancestry in the U.S. \u201c If there are Ukrainians who are not able to remain safely and for whom resettlement in the United States is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ] and the E.U .\nto consider them .\nThat is not a quick process , and so we will be looking at other options and what more we can do , \u201d a spokesperson for the State Department said Thursday , though they added that the U.S. expects most of those displaced by the war will want to remain in Europe .\nMark Krikorian , the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies , told The American Conservative that \u201c there \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the southern border .\n\u201c They came through European countries , where they were free to remain , and chose to try to come here instead.\n\u201d Krikorian said U.S. policy should have a clearly stated goal before accepting large numbers of Ukrainian refugees .\n\u201c If the point is to shelter people til the war is over , then bringing them here to join relatives is counterproductive\u2014none of them will ever return .\nAnd with the prospect of an agreement , we should hold off on permanent resettlement and instead provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states to care for the people who crossed over from next door.\n\u201d Krikorian added that if it becomes \u201c clear the war will drag on for years , Afghanistan-style , then it would be the time to discuss permanent resettlement for some of them , though even then , the vast majority will remain in Europe.\n\u201d Earlier this month , the

of Homeland Security claims will cover more than 75,000 individuals\u2014more than double prior estimates .\nWhat \u2019 s more , just last week the Biden administration reversed a decision to bar a Ukrainian woman and her three children from entering the U.S. because of Title 42 .\nThe Ukrainian woman in her mid-thirties and her children\u201414 , 12 , and 6 years old\u2014were allowed to enter

serious danger of the introduction of [ a communicable ] disease into the United States.\n\u201d Under President Donald Trump , the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) used this law to issue an emergency regulation on March 20 , 2020 to turn away migrants attempting to cross the border .\nSince the regulation was put in place , more than 1.2 million migrants have been prevented from entering the U.S. under Title 42 .\nBiden \u2019 s pro-migrant messaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his tenure have thrown America \u2019 s southern border into chaos .\nThe unprecedented surge in migrants has continued since January 2021 , despite the fact that Biden has kept Title 42 provisions in place .\nNow , pressure from congressional Democrats and immigrant activist groups is causing the Biden administration to consider rescinding the Title 42 emergency regulations .\nThe Biden administration has already lifted the Title 42 restrictions for unaccompanied minors seeking entry to the United States .\nWith these developments in mind , it \u2019 s not hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of hand .\nThus far in fiscal year 2022 , which began on October 1 , 2021 , U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) data show that more than 5,500 Ukrainians have already attempted to cross into the U.S. illegally .\nThe CBP data also say that 85 percent ( 4,807 ) of these Ukrainian migrants were single adults\u2014which often means single adult men\u2014and only 15 percent ( 723 ) were members of proclaimed familial units traveling together .\nBut it \u2019 s not just an influx of Ukrainians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the southern border .\nMigrants from Mexico and the Northern Triangle nations are still arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border with their own aspirations to get into the United States .\nThe Biden administration \u2019 s willingness to be flexible with Ukrainian migrants has reportedly inflamed tensions among migrants waiting for their shot at entry .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a lot of confusion since President Biden declared all Ukrainians are welcome in the U.S. but there \u2019 s no system in place to receive them , \u201d Patrick Murphy , the director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Border Report .\n\u201c But it \u2019 s going to be easier for them , and I \u2019 m sorry to say this , but since they are fair-skinned , they are going to get preferential treatment.\n\u201d One male migrant

Kyle Rittenhouse case , some interesting items in the court proceedings escaped mainstream attention .\nOne appeared in the testimony of Gaige Grosskreutz , the lone survivor of the three people Rittenhouse shot on August 25 , 2020 .\nOn the stand , Grosskreutz conceded that Rittenhouse had not fired when Grosskreutz raised his empty hands and refrained from attacking .\nWhen Grosskreutz then drew a firearm and pointed it at Rittenhouse \u2019 s head , Rittenhouse shot him .\nThe mainstream press pretty much ignored this aspect of the testimony .\nConservative observers highlighted Grosskreutz \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in previous legal motions he had filed , as well as the fact that he was carrying illegally due to his carry permit having been invalidated .\nFor the purposes of this column , however , what is really interesting is that Grosskreutz testified under oath that he was on the streets that evening as a legal advisor for the Wisconsin ACLU .\nLegal observers are so important to leftist movements that a friend involved in lefty organizing was shocked when I explained to him that right of center legal observers do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Team Righty doesn \u2019 t have lawyers .\nThere are conservative-leaning groups like the Federalist Society .\nThere are conservative-leaning legal advocacy organizations , such as the Alliance for Defending Freedom .\nThere are individual conservative lawyers and law firms .\nThere are some far right lawyers and occasional ( failed ) far right efforts to create some kind of actual far right legal defense apparatus .\nBut the legal infrastructure on the mainstream and far left , which includes legal observers , is something else entirely .\nOfficially , legal observers exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness and record the actions of the police and protect the civil rights of the public .\nIn the words of their ACLU training , they are there to \u201c observe , educate , document , and deter.\n\u201d In practical terms , legal observers are an arm of the demonstrators who launder their demonstrator-friendly recordings and testimony through a separate organization that provides a veneer of impartiality to media for complaints about police actions .\nIn some respects , this approach is fair .\nThere are often plenty of legitimate reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time , it \u2019 s deliberately deceptive .\nLegal observers are impartial in the sense that they want police to obey the law like everyone else , but they \u2019 re not impartial in the sense that they don \u2019 t give a damn about your right to not have your business burned down .\nYou see that tension at work in a legal observer training held by the ACLU-WI on June 5 , 2020 , not long before the shooting in Kenosha ; Grosskreutz would have attended either this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you watch the video or read our lightly cleaned-up transcript ( less \u201c ers , \u201d \u201c ums , \u201d and the like ; names and contact information redacted because this column is not about specific individual people but about the mechanics and infrastructure ) , you \u2019 ll note it \u2019 s mostly about methods .\nThe trainer puts a lot of emphasis on being professional and doing a professional job .\nIt \u2019 s not a fire-and-brimstone lecture on how cops suck .\nBut the training also shows ACLU-WI walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example : The appearance of impartiality is very important to the ACLU .\nThe trainer instructs people who are legal observing to not warmly greet demonstrators whom they happen to know , not to engage in debates , and not to join in chants : \u201c In case you are called upon to be a witness in a subsequent lawsuit , we don \u2019 t want to see you chanting on a video camera , \u2018 Fuck the police \u2019 while you \u2019 re trying to give impartial observations of police interaction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of demonstrators .\nIt \u2019 s going to be easy to discredit you that way \u201d ( Slide 9 , 10:37 ) .\nThe trainer also emphasizes that legal observers aren \u2019 t there to provide advice for protestors : That slip of the tongue\u2014 \u201c legal obs\u2014other demonstrators \u201d \u2014is amusingly Freudian .\nThe ACLU \u2019 s success in standing up for demonstrators depends on a perception of its impartiality , but the people who attend their trainings and turn out to protests to do the actual work of legal observing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of people who go to protests .\nAnd the trainer recognizes this .\nWhen asked whether legal observers should stand down from observing when a curfew is in effect , he says yes , but adds : \u201c We \u2019 ve instructed our legal observers generally to not get themselves exposed and ticketed during a curfew .\nNow , here \u2019 s a beautiful thing about legal observers .\nWe have trained well over a thousand people to be legal observers in my 15-year duration here with the ACLU of Wisconsin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are demonstrators who have been legal observers , and they know exactly what to photograph and film while they \u2019 re demonstrating .\nAnd so they \u2019 re capturing a lot of the same story and sharing that with us \u201d ( Slide 76 , 1:40:44 ) .\nThe trainer \u2019 s solution to the appearance of conflicts of interest is to ask people to not be legal observers and protestors on the same day ( Slide 76 , 1:44:52 ) .\nUnsurprisingly , while the presentation \u2019 s early slides stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give advice to protestors , a later section of the presentation includes advice for protestors ( Slide 74 , 1:32:21 ) , from strategic advice about deciding on and effectively conveying the message of the demonstration and using it to effectively build power , to more tactical information about documenting suspected agent provocateurs and using bail funds .\nThe tension between the appearance of impartiality and the reality that legal observers tend to come from the radical community also manifests in the training \u2019 s attitude towards breaking the law .\nOn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to refrain from breaking the law\u2014no violence , no public urination ( which can be a surprising temptation during lengthy protests ) , no theft ; not even taking down an old poster to write on if you need paper ( Slide 11 , 15:32 ) .\nThere is an exception if someone is in immediate danger or hurt , but even then the trainer stresses a separation of roles : \u201c If you feel you see something untoward\u2014maybe there \u2019 s some sort of violent clash between protesters and counter protesters\u2014and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , just take off your legal observer vest before you mix it up .\nBut do what you need to do within the general parameters of the rules that we have set up \u201d ( Slide 76 , 1:43:44 ) .\nOn the other hand , more than once the question comes up about what legal observers , whose job is recording evidence , should do when protestors may be breaking the law .\nThe trainer reassures them that protecting the public from protestors is not part of their job .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facial images of folks because that could also be evidence against them if they do something .\nOr maybe they \u2019 ve taken off from work because they know their boss is hostile to them participating in the Black Lives Matter action because their boss is a racist , and you don \u2019 t want to get them fired either lawfully or\u2014I mean unlawfully fired because they \u2019 ve been captured on that video and you \u2019 ve accidentally posted it to the public where their boss can see this and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 22:53 ) .\nHe later reiterates this point , and adds an interesting amplification ( Slide 22 , 48:55 ) : \u201c And the footage you \u2019 re sharing with us , we \u2019 re not going to share pell-mell .\nWe \u2019 ve got years of experience ; our lawyers may evaluate this for possible use , and then we will , um , do due diligence to identify the people that are in these videos and reach out to them before we begin to engage.\n\u201d Legal observers themselves are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but unarmed ( Slide 11 , 18:06 ) : \u201c Don \u2019 t bring drugs , alcohol , or weapons .\nI don \u2019 t care what you do in your free time .\nI don \u2019 t care what you have the right to do or what you feel you have the right to do while we \u2019 re legal observing .\nMany people have different comfort levels with other\u2014with many different issues .\nAnd we just don \u2019 t bring drugs , alcohol , weapons.\n\u201d The trainer notes that \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons in Wisconsin , \u201d but it \u2019 s important to respect the lead of the organizers\u2014and , of course , the law .\nWhat if a legal observer is arrested ?\nThe answer is interesting and surprisingly generous : \u201c We have never ever ever turned our back on one of our people .\nWe have waited hours for them and called and checked in , alerted their loved ones and taken care of them .\nSo although you may when you become a legal observer sign a waiver that says we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave you there , we have not yet done that .\nAnd , in fact , the ACLU has repeatedly worked to get pro bono attorneys for demonstrators who are not legal observers who have been caught up exercising their First Amendment rights or engaged in non-destructive acts of civil disobedience that we felt that they should have our assistance in finding somebody to help them with fines and fees or navigating that .\nSo I personally will never turn my back on you \u201d ( Slide 76 , 1:47:25 ) .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an overview , people that wish to be legal observers with the ACLU of Wisconsin\u2026need to coordinate with us before the actions so we can support you .\nYou can \u2019 t just go out and say you \u2019 re a legal observer if you \u2019 re involved in some stuff .\nIt \u2019 s not a magic pass .\nNobody legal observing is above or exempt from the law .\nIt just helps us to coordinate with you so that we know and are aware of where there might be a potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also to support you if something goes poorly \u201d ( Slide 6 , 3:49 ) .\nAll of this raises some interesting questions .\nIf Grosskreutz \u2019 s testimony was truthful and he was actually a legal observer for the ACLU-WI , did the ACLU-WI stand by Grosskreutz ?\nDid he benefit from their offer of support ?\nGiven that he violated law and the ACLU \u2019 s rules by illegally carrying a firearm , is he still a legal observer for the ACLU ?\nAs far as I know , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have they asked the interesting ones downstream of them : Namely , does the ACLU have any potential exposure to a lawsuit given that one of their legal observers tried to use an illegally-carried handgun to shoot someone exercising a right to legally justified self-defense ?\nNot being a lawyer , I wouldn \u2019 t care to speculate .\nIt \u2019 s darkly amusing to note a parallel , though : The white nationalist group Aryan Nations was financially obliterated by a Southern Poverty Law Center-backed lawsuit after its security guards mistook a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , opened fire on the car , and detained the terrified occupants .\nIt \u2019 s not a one-to-one parallel , however , and a judgment that \u2019 s an extinction-level event for a white nationalist organization\u2014 $ 6.3 million in year 2000 dollars\u2014would be petty cash for the ACLU .\nRecently this approach came into question in a case involving two environmental activists , Jessica Reznicek and Ruby Montoya , who became disappointed with the failure of protests to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline and had turned to sabotage , burning heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipeline .\nThey set their first fire in November 2016 and continued into 2017 , causing minor but costly delays .\nReznicek and Montoya came out of the Catholic Worker movement\u2014if you don \u2019 t know it , it \u2019 s a far left Catholic group with close to 200 group homes all over the United States .\nThough they \u2019 re pledged to nonviolence , and some members find even property damage controversial , the group spins off and even supports some pretty serious radicals .\nDuring their spree , Reznicek had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic Worker newsletter .\nAfter their arrest in January , Montoya used the annual fundraising letter for their Catholic Worker house to raise personal funds .\nWhen interviewed by Julia Shipley for a Rolling Stone/GRIST profile in January 2020 , Montoya\u2014ankle monitor and all\u2014was still living in a Catholic Worker house .\nAccording to Shipley \u2019 s profile of the two women , Reznicek fell in with the Catholic Workers after being impressed with the ongoing support role they played in her local Occupy protests .\nMontoya , a preschool teacher , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts of Reznicek \u2019 s protests .\nThe women escaped detection , but not the suspicion of pipeline security contractor TigerSwan .\nWhen TigerSwan documents leaked to the Intercept , and a journalist approached Reznicek and Montoya for comment , the women decided to confess to their sabotage in a last effort to convince the public of the seriousness of their cause .\nIn July 2017 , they recorded a statement , delivered it , and vandalized the sign of the Iowa Utilities Board , for which they were promptly arrested .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reznicek and Montoya lived , but the women weren \u2019 t charged for the pipeline sabotage until September 2019\u2014a long interval that , as Shipley \u2019 s Rolling Stone piece notes , suggests the government was unsuccessfully monitoring Reznicek and Montoya to find potential co-conspirators .\nReznicek and Montoya received pro bono representation from a member of the National Lawyers \u2019 Guild .\nBoth pleaded guilty .\nSubsequently , however , Montoya changed her lawyer .\nThis new counsel , also a member of the National Lawyers \u2019 Guild , filed to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the severe abuse Montoya had suffered growing up had left her stunted and unusually vulnerable to manipulation .\nThe filing quoted TigerSwan \u2019 s own assessment that she appeared to have been brainwashed .\nThe new counsel argued that both the original counsel and Montoya \u2019 s father had pressured Montoya to plead guilty against Montoya \u2019 s own interests , the counsel for reasons of solidarity with her co-defendant and her father to prevent his abuse of Montoya from coming out in court .\nThe original lawyer , and a faction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the new counsel expelled from the National Lawyers Guild , on the grounds that the new counsel was undermining the entire concept of movement lawyering\u2014that is , pursuing collective and noncooperative defense to pursue a legal outcome that may be more harmful to individual defendants , who willingly assume that burden in order to preserve and advance their movement .\nThe original NLG lawyer \u2019 s faction puts it this way : If that \u2019 s a little muddy , let \u2019 s clear it up .\nThe general assumption in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new lawyer has Montoya cooperating with law enforcement\u2014i.e.\n, telling cops what she knows about the movement .\nThis is anathema to the National Lawyers Guild at large , which is less concerned with the fate of individual clients than it is with preserving and perpetuating radical leftist movements .\nTo be fair , this is a philosophy that those individual clients often share .\nFrom the point of view of Montoya \u2019 s new attorney , however , the philosophy of representing the entire movement led the previous NLG lawyer to bully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prison term rather than , you know , actually representing the interests of the client .\nCriminal defense attorney Mark Bennett was struck by the case when I mentioned it on Twitter .\nHe was more interested when he discovered he knew the lawyer who was the subject of the internal NLG complaint , and then he tracked down and read the NLG complaint itself .\nHis reaction , posted to his Substack , was detailed , frank , and extremely negative .\nNoted Bennett : \u201c This damns not only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its members for doing their job for their clients ?\n\u2014but also its members\u2014What sort of lawyers pay dues to an organization that will damn them for doing their job for their clients ?\n\u201d \u201c By threatening to expel Daphne [ the new lawyer ] for suggesting that association with an organization such as NLG may create an inherent conflict with the interests of the Client Singular , NLG demonstrates that membership in NLG creates an inherent conflict with the interests of every client.\n\u201d Bennett further argued that \u201c The Taskforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecutors seeking to keep NLG members from appearing for defendants in criminal cases.\n\u201d He \u2019 s not wrong ; it could be .\nAnd if NLG members were barred from appearing for defendants at trial , it would be a huge blow to far left movements .\nBut it doesn \u2019 t strike me as exceedingly likely .\nIt \u2019 s not clear that any prosecutors will be even entertaining the possibility in individual cases , much less that prosecutors nationwide would embrace it as general policy .\nEven if they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide infrastructure and support outside of courtrooms , as would all the other aspects of leftist legal infrastructure .\nAnd that infrastructure is colossal .\nFrom our perspective on Team Righty , countering them through lawsuits and policy may be necessary , but even more important is learning from them .\nRight now , the closest thing to a legal observer role on the right is the emerging amateur documentarian\u2014which , even when done laudably , lacks longstanding institutional infrastructure and is dependent on a relatively small number of people .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the existing legal institutions on the right

.\nSadly , our mechanics have neglected to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state supreme courts have effectively slashed the tires of their respective constitutions by insisting on interpreting them in \u201c

Corvettes sitting idle .\nThe residents of New Jersey , Missouri , and New Hampshire can remind the rest of us of the importance of our state constitutions by voting to host constitutional conventions on the November 2022 ballot .\nEach of those three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional conventions , and eleven other states have similar provisions .\nThese three states could kick off a new New Federalism movement , and , boy , do we need it .\nIt \u2019 s unlikely that the next generation of lawyers will restore state constitutions to their rightful place as a source of \u201c fundamental rights and liberties.\n\u201d Most law schools don \u2019 t teach their students about state constitutions .\nJust a handful offer state constitution law courses .\nMany lawyers neglect to pursue their clients \u2019 claims under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understandable given that scholar James Gardner characterized state constitutional law as a \u201c vast wasteland of confusing , conflict , and essentially unintelligible pronouncements.\n\u201d Former Oregon Supreme Court Justice Hans Linde concluded that \u201c a generation of lawyers seems literally speechless when faced with questions of state constitutional law.\n\u201d And judges in state courts have not helped .\nThey too have failed to \u201c offer\u2026a coherent discourse of state constitutional law , \u201d Gardner said .\nNew Federalism , a movement championed by U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan , acknowledges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dual sovereignty .\nBrennan and others attempted to revive a common sentiment from our nation \u2019 s founding\u2014that the federal government and state government are each independent sovereigns with specific spheres of action .\nOur Founding Fathers , fiercely loyal and devoted to their states , theorized in Federalist No .\n45 that the states\u2014not the federal government\u2014would lead the way in ensuring the \u201c the lives , liberties , and properties of the people.\n\u201d Sure , the federal government would lead in exceptional times marked by \u201c war and danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments were to dominate in \u201c times of peace and security.\n\u201d New Federalists , like Gardner , believe that a state must be a \u201c self-governing political society of individuals who comprise a subset of all American citizens.\n\u201d Of course , state constitutions play a critical role in that self-governance , because they are meant to reflect , as Gardner put it , \u201c the fundamental values , and ultimately the character , of the people of the state that adopted it.\n\u201d That aspiration never materialized in many states .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , all but copied and pasted parts of Indiana \u2019 s constitution , and borrowed heavily from the constitutions of Wisconsin , New York , Ohio , Michigan , and Maine , in drafting its own .\nSo , rather than Oregonians living under a constitution that reflects their fundamental character , they adhere to a Frankenstein constitution that has become even more confusing , contradictory , and cureless with the hundreds of amendments that followed its adoption .\nOregonians and residents of many other states live under state constitutions that fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Founders .\nThat \u2019 s what makes the potential for constitutional conventions in New Jersey , Missouri , and New Hampshire newsworthy .\nA modern state constitutional convention would have at its disposal tools unimagined by the Founding Fathers to ensure that the resulting document reflects the character , priorities , and interests of state residents .\nLike Iceland , state constitutional conventions could use YouTube , Facebook , and Twitter to share drafts of their constitution and solicit feedback .\nLike Ireland , these conventions could use randomly selected residents ( similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist with draft-writing .\nLike Chile , these conventions could guarantee the participation of certain cultural groups left out of the first round of state constitutional drafting .\nMost importantly , these three states could spark the imaginations of Americans .\nAs more coastal dwellers move and bring their politics and money to new states , it \u2019 s imperative that existing residents have recourse to protect the character of their state .\nSome folks may contest the validity of such efforts\u2014after all , isn \u2019 t it the idea that people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d and move to states that reflect their values ?\nThat certainly hasn \u2019 t been the case in practice .\nFor one , some folks don \u2019 t have the finances to pick up and move to a new state .\nAnd the folks who are moving aren \u2019 t shy about bringing their politics with them , rather than accepting the unique political environment of their new home .\nIn other words , folks are vetoing with their feet .\nJust ask the residents of Kalispell , Montana , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a very different perspective on life but were so enthralled by the show Yellowstone that they had to uproot and claim Montana as home .\nThese new residents are unafraid to assert their views rather than acclimate to the character of their new neighbors .\nNational attention on three state constitutional conventions could be the key to Americans in all 50 states dusting off their state constitutions and taking their metaphorical Corvette for a spin .\nDoing so would align with the Founders \u2019 visions of states as independent sovereigns , guarantors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political bodies with their own

\u2019 s press secretary to anti-CRT crusader Christopher Rufo .\nEven high-profile accounts devoted to exposing the insanity of the LGBT left crossed sides to declare their approval of the Rubins \u2019 impending procurement of two children .\nEt tu , @ libsoftiktok ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel Rubin explains in graphic detail the process by which he and the other Dave created these two children .\nFirst , though , he explains that he was so career-driven that he had never seriously considered having children .\nHe reflects , \u201c In a weird way I guess the gay thing kind of gives you , like , an easy out on that , because , uh , I \u2019 m not a scientitian but , uh , it \u2019 s hard for two biological men or two biological women to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hard ?\nDoes that mean they can pull it off if they really put their minds to it ? )\nRubin explains further that , growing up in the Dark Age of 1980s New York , he didn \u2019 t quite think it was normal for two men to have babies together .\nHe catches himself quickly , though : \u201c I don \u2019 t like that word , normal.\n\u201d But the other Dave finally wore him down , and the two men jumped into a process that seems to a sane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women who are willing to donate their eggs , and women obviously make a lot of eggs\u2014uh , some make a lot of eggs , some don \u2019 t make eggs .\nBut the donors are usually young and healthy , and if they want to help people that otherwise can \u2019 t have children , they can donate their eggs .\nSo you basically go on all of these websites , there are all of these

education , \u201d or some combination thereof .\n\u2026 And , you know , there are different rates and all of these things .\nThat last sentence presumably refers to the amount of money Rubin would have paid to a given woman for the purchase of her eggs .\nThe podcaster goes on to explain that a number of eggs\u201418 the first time around\u2014were taken from this woman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would be fertilized with one of the two men \u2019 s semen .\n\u201c Some of it takes , some of it doesn \u2019 t take , \u201d but suffice to say that quite a few zygotes\u2014biologically distinct human beings\u2014were created in the process .\nAnd then you need surrogates .\nSo the surrogate , obviously , is the woman who then carries the child .\nSo basically what we \u2019 ve got cookin \u2019 here is that we have one baby that is from my stuff and one baby that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they both will have the same biological mother\u2014and we wanted them to have that sort of genetic

for a higher purpose , for sure .\nAnd really two absolutely amazing women are carrying our babies right now .\nThis is evil , plain and simple .\nDave and Dave paid for the creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @

.\nThis , of course , is the primary issue : the moral abomination of surrogacy itself , the commodification of the human child , the relegation of women to the status of incubators .\nBut there is a secondary concern as well .\nThe same people who make a living being outraged that Lia Thomas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to swim in the women \u2019 s races for his college can not turn around and tell us that

pick that Biden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina days before a primary he could not afford to lose , first made his pledge to nominate a black woman to the Supreme Court .\nBiden cynically announced his pick in the midst of the Ukrainian invasion to fit it into the final hours of Black History Month .\nAs a panderer , the 2022-version of Joe Biden lies about being arrested during the civil-rights movement , while the 1960s-version would not have been caught within miles of a demonstration .\nBiden of course follows others down this cynical path , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime bill that led to the incarceration of scores of black youths and turned around to do an Amos \u2018 n Andy accent in Selma as she sought the black vote .\nBiden has a long history of racism , including referring to Barack

in the case of affirmative action .\nAffirmative action , which the Supreme Court strained to declare constitutional , allowed a nation that pretended to strive toward equality to instead enact the opposite , by upholding separate standards based on skin color .\nThe hypocrisy began with Regents of the University of California v. Bakke , a 1978 Supreme Court case that held that a university violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it made admissions decisions on the \u201c definite and exclusive basis \u201d of race .\nThat bit about \u201c definite and exclusive basis \u201d was crucial\u2014race could be a criterion , but just not the only one .\nThe Court ruled that a university \u2019 s use of racial \u201c quotas \u201d in its admissions process was unconstitutional , but a school \u2019 s use of \u201c affirmative action \u201d to accept more minority applicants was constitutional .\nIn this case , the university \u2019 s offense was being too clear ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of 100 admission spots exclusively for black students instead of just putting its thumb on the scale and\u2014presto !\n\u2014filling 16 out of 100 slots with black students .\nIn 2003 \u2019 s Grutter v. Bollinger , the Supreme Court upheld the University of Michigan Law School \u2019 s admissions policy , which used racial preference to promote diversity .\nBlack applicants were admitted under different standards than members of every other group .\nThe fudge was again to say that affirmative action is constitutional so long as it treats race as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not substitute for individualized review of the applicants .\nThe Court wordsmithed its way into declaring decisions based on race constitutional so long as the goal was diversity ( good ) and not whitewashing ( bad ) .\nIt did so even as it said , at exactly the same time , that racial-quota systems are always \u201c odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.\n\u201d But Grutter in 2003 came with an interesting addendum : Affirmative action was supposed to be a short-term , temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger issues .\nJustice Sandra Day O \u2019 Connor famously stated , \u201c We expect that 25 years from now , the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest in student body diversity.\n\u201d Some 19 years in , how \u2019 s that working out ?\nThere have been challenges to affirmative action in both schools and workplaces over the years .\nThere are two such cases now before the Supreme Court\u2014Students for Fair Admissions v.

University of North Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may see things differently , but to date , the Court \u2019 s answer has always been the same : Racial discrimination that favors black applicants is constitutional , as long as you use nice words like \u201c race is a factor \u201d and not nasty ones like \u201c No Irish Need Apply.\n\u201d The irony is that Joe Biden \u2019 s decision to restrict his pool of Supreme Court candidates to black women would be unlikely to meet the Supreme Court \u2019 s own tests for affirmative action in academia .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule\u2014race can only be one

violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act , which prohibits making employment decisions because of an individual \u2019 s skin color , national origin , sex , religion , or race in almost all cases

1991 , used to write columns in which he peered into the souls of various leaders to see how the world looked from their point of view .\nSafire \u2019 s oeuvre of columns was a great illustration of how infinite talent , when hitched to bad ideas , makes plodding types seem like geniuses\u2014though Bill was always fun and entertaining , unlike fellow columnist Abe Rosenthal , who wrote about America \u2019 s adversaries like he \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature ( Hobbes \u2019 s , not Rousseau \u2019 s ) .\nPeering into the souls of the parties to the JCPOA ( Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ) is , then , a good idea , but one especially difficult to prosecute today .\nFor one thing , the onset of the Total Economic War Against Russia ( TEWAR ) must be seen as altering the calculations of the parties in central ways , though exactly how is a bit obscure .\nFor another , we don \u2019 t know basic things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the one that is basically all wrapped up .\nHow many sanctions on the Iranians would be lifted ?\nHow much ready cash would they get ?\nNot clear .\nAlso unclear is the status of the Russian objections to the accord that were stated by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on March 8 .\nThose had two components , one of which was that there should be no obstruction to the technical details of the plan , in which Russia is to play a vital role .\nThat has been accepted .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement must provide \u201c for the absence of any obstacles to [ Russian ] trade , economic and investment relations with Iran.\n\u201d That has not been accepted .\nIn his March 15 press briefing , Lavrov didn \u2019 t mention this condition , the far more critical condition .\nAccording to observers close to the Vienna talks , that Russian condition has not been withdrawn .\nIt is completely unacceptable to Washington .\nIn Secretary of State Antony Blinken \u2019 s view , the Ukraine sanctions are \u201c totally different from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked together.\n\u201d The Russians say they are .\nThe gap looks unbridgeable .\nBeyond the discrete issues there is the fact that the participants to the deal are sniping at one another in vitriolic terms .\nWashington seems set on drawing up war crimes charges against the Russian leadership ; the Russians say that the Americans are straight out liars .\nBoth sides seem much more intent on assigning responsibility for the collapse of the deal than actually reaching a deal .\nThe conclusion seems unavoidable that the JCPOA is doomed .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is near death .\nIt may be too early to conduct an autopsy of the cause of death , with so much still unknown , but a few observations on that score are offered here .\nWe will conclude with a eulogy .\nTo external appearances , Washington \u2019 s motive for getting to an agreement on a revived JCPOA was the desire to get Iranian oil onto the market .\nThat would mitigate the explosive effect on the oil price of the TEWAR .\nThat seems at first sight a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the \u201c whatever you want , we don \u2019 t want \u201d principle , but the question is more complicated .\nLavrov says the extra 2 million barrels a day is not a big deal and that Russia favors it .\nAny effect on oil prices would be handled by OPEC+ , led by Saudi Arabia and Russia .\nWhat do the Saudis think about this ?\nWhile President Biden has had conversations with King Salman of Saudi Arabia , he has not since his inauguration had a single conversation with Saudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background story is that MBS is not returning Biden \u2019 s calls and doesn \u2019 t care what he thinks .\nBiden denounced the Crown Prince as a murderous thug during the 2020 campaign , while adding that the Saudi government has \u201c very little social redeeming value.\n\u201d His administration made clear that relations with Saudi Arabia had been recalibrated as of January 20 , 2021 , which downgraded MBS \u2019 s social credit score to junk .\nSo a personal chat would be awkward .\nBiden \u2019 s conversations with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been especially productive , as the custodian of the Two Holy Mosques has been beset by Alzheimer \u2019 s for over five years .\nThe meaningful part of this embarrassing situation is that the actual ruler of Saudi Arabia , the crown prince , would much prefer a conversation with Putin than with Biden .\nAmerica \u2019 s influence with the World \u2019 s Oil Despots isn \u2019 t what it used to be .\nThis is important .\nOn March 19 , one of the world \u2019 s foremost authorities on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an emergency situation \u201d which could get a lot worse .\nWhat of Russia \u2019 s interest in nuclear non-proliferation ?\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said on March 8 that Russia remained \u201c engaged \u201d in efforts to revive the Iran deal , \u201c and it has its own interests in ensuring that Iran is not able to acquire a nuclear weapon.\n\u201d In other words , Russia fears an Iranian bomb .\nThat is not exactly wrong , but baldly stated it can also be very misleading , because Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than America or Israel or Saudi Arabia does , and for different reasons .\nRussia has shared a general \u201c world order \u201d interest in strongly discouraging nuclear proliferation , but one more power to the south with the bomb\u2014China , India , Pakistan , and Israel now have them\u2014would not be especially dangerous to Moscow .\nThe Russians don \u2019 t buy the Washington narrative that mad-crazed mullahs are thirsting for a bomb so they can blow up Israel and then America .\nIran , of course , denies that it seeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know with what degree of credence Russia takes these pledges .\nThe Russians certainly sympathize with the Iranian position that Iran has been subject to discriminatory standards by the western powers .\nAs they \u2019 re both now in the pirate \u2019 s den , they will commiserate with one another on that point .\nBut Russia did genuinely want a deal and wanted it for the reason most sensible people in the West did .\nIt saw as well as anyone in the early 2010s that an Iranian bomb could be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Israel and America had stated it to be such .\nOne famous journalist , we may recall , said an Israeli attack on Iran was imminent in 2012 .\nSo the Russians favored and even facilitated the compromise .\nIndeed , they kept doing so until the Ukraine War .\nOn February 23 , the day before Putin launched his invasion , the Washington Postreported that \u201c several officials \u201d had praised the role of Russia and China in the negotiations .\nThe two powers had been \u201c cooperative and active in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then .\nNow , given that the United States is pressed in both Europe and East Asia , the Russians might not mind a refocusing of Washington \u2019 s attention on the Iran nuclear danger .\nA breakdown of the deal would do that .\nThe United States could avoid this unpleasant outcome by accepting Lavrov \u2019 s conditions , but it just can \u2019 t .\nIt never retreats from anything , just hunkers down in applying pressure .\nIt got out of Afghanistan , but it did not accept its defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dictate the form of government the people of Afghanistan shall have .\nThis bullheadedness is rather unusual in diplomatic history , and it has stemmed from America \u2019 s unique position as the unipolar power , rare in the classic history of the European system over five centuries .\nBut it is a vital legacy from the past decades , much harder to give up than nicotine addiction .\nWashington \u2019 s refusal to concede any merit to the Russian position should therefore win the day , as it always seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we started .\nNo deal , with both sides parting with declarations that the breakdown is the other state \u2019 s fault .\nThe Iran hawks always wanted that outcome , as they hated the JCPOA , but a breakdown now has a fundamentally different meaning than previously .\nThe target of opportunity in Iran , in these circumstances , gains protection from the swirling U.S. crises in Europe and East Asia with Russia and China .\nThe thesis that the parties can \u2019 t get to a signing ceremony may , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let \u2019 s assume it is wrong .\nWould the JCPOA then survive the Washington gauntlet ?\nThe executive-congressional basis for an accord is obscure , but the intention previously stated was that the administration was \u201c girding itself for a vote \u201d in Congress .\nHow that would work was never clear , in part because the full details of the putative agreement , especially on sanctions relief , aren \u2019 t known .\nBut inevitably the administration would come to Congress on an awkward footing .\nOver the last five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not Russia but Washington .\nBoth Israel and Saudi Arabia opposed the JCPOA back in 2015 .\nThe Obama administration made the initial deal over the opposition of both Crown Prince Salman and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .\nTo reassure them , the Obama administration said that the agreement would not imperil their security .\nYes , the deal had required some painful compromises , but it also had tons of safeguards .\nIt was a lot better than the alternative .\n\u201c We understand you disagree , \u201d said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also understand that we have no intention of breaking our friendship and that we fully appreciate your security concerns.\n\u201d In 2015 , the administration was politically vulnerable at home , charged with the sin of \u201c selling out its allies.\n\u201d It made repeated efforts to reassure them .\nThat was 2015 .\nRight now , in the last few weeks , the primary motive has seemed to change .\nIt finds Biden \u2019 s people greedily eyeing that extra two million barrels of oil a day and just maybe some gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied that this is its primary motivation for the deal .\nThe primary motive , they say , remains the same : the deal on the merits , especially its vital contribution in preventing an Iranian bomb .\nThe Iranian oil is an after-dinner cognac , not the main dish .\nTo critics , however , the explanation would look very fishy .\nThe Biden administration has been in office for over the year .\nWhy , the critics would ask , the zeal now for an agreement , as opposed to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waived its previous objections , why were they given up ?\nWhy were they important previously and then not important ?\nRiyadh and Jerusalem would ask themselves these questions .\nNay , in the very bowels of neoconservatism , which wants both to crush Russia and protect Israel , these questions would be asked .\nRepublicans would ask such questions not to get answers\u2014they \u2019 ve already made up their mind\u2014but to pummel the administration .\nThe introduction of the two-million-barrel-motive onto the political table wounds the original promise , which was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNow , it \u2019 s obviously about not just that , but something else , and the desire to get that something else would cast a very sooty pall over its reception in Congress .\nThe likely Republican sweep of the 2022 congressional mid-terms also suggests a limited shelf-life for any deal , like a six-month apartment lease with an option to leave if the apt .\ndweller got sick of living there .\nWhatever Biden achieves is easily reversed , as Obama \u2019 s signature accomplishment was reversed .\nSurely all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the U.S. record in that respect .\nBut even putting aside what looks like a grim thrashing in November , the deal might not pass muster with Congress even before that fearful electoral reckoning .\nCheck out Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland \u2019 s testimony to Congress on March 8 .\nShe was beset by a pack of Republican barkers , appalled that she should ever think of engaging in such a sordid transaction as the liberation of Iranian oil .\nThe people against the Iran deal\u2014that odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic Council types and Atlantic Magazine scribblers\u2014wanted its breakdown because they wanted to set the Iranian program to rights , by economic coercion if possible , through force if necessary .\nThey had read their Machiavelli and knew that the secret to Rome \u2019 s success was to encounter one enemy at a time , each adversary too dim-witted to see the danger .\nThey assumed that the opportunity to squeeze Iran , opened by the collapse of the diplomatic track , would arise without a searing international crisis elsewhere .\nThen history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escalation with Russia is on everybody \u2019 s mind , and China has been since 2020 America \u2019 s biggest strategic threat , how would escalation with Iran look ?\nFrom a geostrategic point of view , not too well , but you can bet that a breakdown of the agreement will lead to renewed furor in Washington about the danger of an Iranian bomb .\nThat intra-Washington spat would not be unwelcome in Moscow right now .\nIt would open up a new front against the Americans , in a Sun Tzu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States is sorely tempted to use its strength against Iran , but with consequences that would weaken it on the Russia front .\nA U.S. war with Iran , even the threat of such , would mean , in practice , a great diversion from the goings-on in Europe .\nBoth the threat of force and the act of force would violate the UN Charter .\nAn actual war would have extremely icky consequences for the world oil price , a factor making for restraint in a town not known for such .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy , alongside a one-and-a-half-war military strategy , yet it abhors the idea of retrenchment .\nBig Problem .\nHere we come to the eulogy .\nThe JCPOA will one day be seen like Minsk 2 , a phantom of the prelapsarian imagination .\nThese agreements , reached in 2015 , were valiant efforts to solve or mitigate intractable conflicts that clearly had further war-producing potential .\nTheir making , conducted by distinguished diplomats like Frank-Walter Steinmeier , John Kerry , and Mohammad Javad Zarif , showed real skill and honest endeavor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to do the right thing well .\nThe sinking feeling is that they\u2014and agreements like them\u2014arose in another era and are doomed in the new era .\nThese compromises are incompatible with the spirit of the new age .\nThey have fallen and will continue to fall before the \u201c no more neutrals \u201d sentiment prevailing in Washington .\nDavid Hendrickson is president of the John Quincy Adams Society and the author of Republic in Peril : American Empire and the Liberal Tradition ( Oxford , 2018 ) .\nHis website is @

Dorian Abbot \u2019 s lecture on the excesses of diversity policies , he gave the same talk at Princeton , where thousands eagerly registered to hear it .\nEven within the notoriously liberal entertainment industry , entertainers \u2019 reluctance to sound politically incorrect has softened considerably since Biden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedians like Jerry Seinfeld , Mel Brooks , and Chris Rock had previously concluded that woke culture made it all but impossible to poke fun at progressive sensibilities , Bill Maher has done just that on his nightly Real Time show , to the apparent delight of studio audiences .\nTo give President Biden sole credit for growing public defiance of progressive thinking would , of course , be an exaggeration .\nAny self-righteous political philosophy held by only seven percent of registered voters will inevitably inspire popular pushback , regardless of who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoting left-wing economic and environmental policies from the very beginning of his administration , Biden effectively , if unintentionally , exposed their harmful consequences to even the most casual observers .\nTake the president \u2019 s $ 1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan , which even some liberal economists now concede has contributed to an inflationary outbreak not experienced since the late 1970s .\nSimilarly , Biden \u2019 s forceful clampdown on fossil-fuel production , supposedly aimed at sparking a compensatory increase in green energy , only jacked up the price of gasoline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petro-dictators like Vladimir Putin , the Iranian mullahs , and Venezuela \u2019 s Nicol\u00e1s Maduro .\nCombined with foreign missteps\u2014a botched withdraw from Afghanistan and a failure to either prevent Russia \u2019 s invasion of the Ukraine or adequately arm the resistance\u2014Biden \u2019 s domestic policies produced poll numbers that made it easier for critics to overcome their fear of being \u201c cancelled \u201d as a racist or climate-change denier if they spoke out .\nAt the very least , risk-averse conservatives , disillusioned independents , and even many traditional Democrats had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed with their rejection of far-left ideas .\nIt also has not helped progressivism \u2019 s cause that , from the very beginning of his administration , the president \u2019 s instinctive response to any policy failure has been to fabricate blatantly transparent lies , like the claims that Build Back Better is completely paid for , our Afghanistan withdrawal was a great success , spending more on social programs will tame inflation , and Russian sanctions were never meant to deter the country from invading Ukraine .\nWhatever progressivism \u2019 s shortcomings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least benefitted from the appearance of being an idealistic crusade\u2014a sincere , if misguided , attempt to compensate for past racial injustices and to preserve the natural environment for future generations .\nBut once a prevaricating president became the movement \u2019 s best-known advocate , its standing with the public inevitably suffered .\nAs Larry Kudlow recently put it , \u201c What the President is doing is devastating\u2026 .\nthe collapsing popular opinion of Biden \u2019 s character and honesty [ has completely undermined ] confidence in his agenda.\n\u201d The interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidency will do to the long-term prospects of the progressive movement , which , not that long ago , seemed to be riding high in the aftermath of the Black Lives Matter protests .\nHas the unpopularity of the president \u2019 s policies and the mistrust of his character delivered a temporary setback to left-wing ideology , or is it on its way to becoming an historical footnote ?\nThe left seems fated to take a major\u2014perhaps even historic\u2014blow in the November mid-terms .\nAccording to a recent Washington Post-ABC News survey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered voters on the so-called \u201c generic ballot , \u201d which indicates the party respondents prefer to represent them in Congress .\nSome observers , like Hudson Institute senior fellow Arthur Herman , believe that if the president remains as committed to a left-wing agenda as he sounded during his State of the Union address , two decades of partisan political wrangling could finally end with a definitive shift to the right .\nJust as the Great Depression destroyed the electorate \u2019 s faith in free markets , putting pro-regulation and redistributionist Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s policies may precipitate a once-in-a-century political reversal .\nOn the other hand , as George Mason University economics professor Tyler Cowen recently argued , numerous institutional imperatives will continue to provide the progressive movement with safe spaces from which it can theoretically rebound .\nFear of employment lawsuits , for example , will make most companies reluctant to abandon their risk-averse policies and pro-diversity rhetoric when it comes to hiring .\nSimilarly , the tenure system at U.S. colleges and universities means that today \u2019 s younger faculty , who tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues , will retain control of their schools \u2019 academic programs for some time to come .\n\u201c The simple march of retirements is going to make universities even more left-wing\u2014and even more out of touch with mainstream America , \u201d says Cowen .\nOne factor that will clearly determine progressivism \u2019 s influence between now and the end of Biden \u2019 s presidency is the extent to which the far left feels embarrassed by him .\nFor if there is anything liberal elites value more than their policies , it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moral superiority .\nTo be mocked on Saturday Night Live , have eloquent attacks on critical race theory come from black and Hispanic parents , or have panicked Democrat politicians concede the need to start drilling and stop spending would at least require progressives to pursue a time-consuming face-lift of their agenda .\nWhatever the future of progressivism , Joe Biden has clearly become its greatest present liability .\nWe may never know the real reason for his abrupt turn from a campaigning moderate to a committed leftist\u2014his debt to Bernie Sanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president has politically damaged the progressive brand in a way that

people .\nWe can not fight a second monumental struggle without detracting from the first one , \u201d Albright wrote in the New York Times in late 2002 .\nThis recent history was exhumed during a spat with then-insurgent Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders , who intimated that Albright , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported the invasion .\nHis camp referred to PolitiFact and a quote of hers from 2003 , \u201c I personally felt the war was justified on the basis of Saddam \u2019 s decade-long refusal to comply with UN Security Council resolutions on WMD.\n\u201d Indeed , an investigation of Albright \u2019 s view at the time can probably be said to conclude : In the way the Republican establishment is today quibbling about the method of a Democratic-led effort against a Democratic bogeyman , Vladimir Putin , some Democrats back then took issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war of revenge against Saddam Hussein .\nPutin , assuredly , stole the 2016 election , and as summarized in Dave Chappelle \u2019 s parody of our 43rd president , the late novelist and president of Iraq \u201c tried to kill my father.\n\u201d Or as Albright wrote in that same Times piece , \u201c At the United Nations yesterday , the president began the job of spelling out the what and why of our policy toward Baghdad .\nThe wisdom of that policy , however , will ultimately hinge on when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fodder for the cynical if extreme view that America would still have embarked on the Iraq crusade under the aptly named President Gore .\nThe demonstrated continued capacity for neoconservatives to weave in and out of the two major political parties in recent years gives one further pause : How would a third-term Democratic White House , with perhaps a second term Secretary Albright , really have reacted to 9/11 ?\nIt \u2019 s certainly as interesting a counterfactual as the Covid-related ones : Would Americans have locked down without a Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or without a putative national political emergency that required carte blanche to the alleged public health and racial justice establishments ?\nBoth blocs had been saying insane things for years with little attention .\nAnd , of course , there is the flipside : Would Republican vaccine hesitancy be so sincere and widespread under a second-term President Trump ?\nWould the nexus of holdouts be epitomized not by white druggies in Razorback country , but white druggies in Russian Hill ?\n( If it \u2019 s still legal to call it that .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ aren \u2019 t required : The house always wins .\nFew embodied that spirit more than Albright , daughter of legendary internationalist Josef Korbel , now namesake of the international relations school in Denver that , among others , educated Condoleezza Rice , a successor of his daughter .\nLike her mentor Zbigniew Brzezinski and predecessor Henry Kissinger ( who is simply going to outlive everybody ) , Albright made the unlikely jump from being born well outside the United States to rising to represent it on the world stage .\nThat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the source of pride in Georgetown salons and comments on Unz.com .\nAlbright was born in Prague in May 1937 , and so before her second birthday , the Allies had handed the place over to Hitler .\nIn ways better elaborated by others , it was a formative experience .\nHer later tenure as U.N. ambassador , secretary of State , and then retired Washington warhorse would be marred not only by zealotry to defend the \u201c liberal international order , \u201d but also by the kind of bigotry she made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWorth it , that is , \u201c We think the price is worth it , \u201d Albright infamously told 60 Minutes on hearing the calculation that Bill Clinton-era sanctions on Iraq had starved more children than Truman had melted at Hiroshima .\nDisgusting Serbs , that is , \u201c Disgusting Serbs , get out !\n\u201d the then-75 year old Albright said , loudly , at a Czech bookstore in 2012 , asked to account for her hand in the bombing of Yugoslavia .\nA special place in hell , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in hell for women who don \u2019 t help each other \u201d and vote for Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders , as Albright said in New Hampshire in 2016 ( apparently most of the women I know , and most millennial women , are headed to Hades\u2026but certainly not Albright . )\nVice President Kamala Harris revealed in a statement yesterday that she first met Albright when she was \u201c a young lawyer in San Francisco.\n\u201d Harris emphasized Albright \u2019 s \u201c compassion , \u201d and , as evidenced by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired track of corporate Muzak , the vice president said Albright had not just \u201c empathy \u201d but \u201c deep empathy.\n\u201d Harris , positively flagging in the polls , no doubt envisions a future homage to herself in the Albright-style .\nShe was \u201c the first \u2018 most powerful woman \u2019 in U.S. History , \u201d as the New Yorker eulogized this week .\nThis is the kind of brute force summation that would be absurd if the shoe were on the other foot .\nLeventy Beria\u2026was a powerful man .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a sad irony of history that 1600 Pennsylvania is introducing the first black woman nominated to the Supreme Court by emphasizing little else besides her gender and race , which is precisely all that the racists of old would have noticed about her .\nThat doesn \u2019 t mean it won \u2019 t work .\nKetanji Brown Jackson will be a Supreme Court justice , and count me as early on this : 10 cents on PredictIt for Harris 2024 will one day look like a steal .\nHarris concluded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on through the lives that she touched , \u201d and I think everyone can agree with that .\nIf you came for a cheerier memorial , I \u2019 ll filch from Hitchens on the death of mega-televangelist Jerry Falwell .\nSpeaking on Hannity & Colmes , Hitch expressed indifference to offending the family of the deceased , noting \u201c they can take comfort from the extraordinary piety and stupidity , and generally speaking , uniformity of the coverage \u201d elsewhere .", "author": "Curt Mills", "url":

Pennsylvania that relied on the discretion given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act\u2014a narrow holding that allows future administrations to revoke the Little Sisters \u2019 exemption .\nThis sort of dealmaking appeals to self-conceived pragmatist Chief Justice Roberts , who voted with Kagan in 64.5 percent of all merits cases in the 2020 term\u2014the same rate at which he sided with Clarence Thomas .\nWhether Kagan becomes more or less pivotal for the liberal wing of the Court depends entirely on Jackson \u2019 s judicial philosophy .\nWe don \u2019 t know what Jackson \u2019 s philosophy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said in her confirmation hearings that she would defer to the original public meaning of the Constitution when the text was dispositive , but she declined to embrace the \u201c originalist \u201d label .\nThe closest she got to outlining a jurisprudential philosophy was describing her \u201c methodology \u201d \u2014that is , clearing her mind of \u201c preconceived notions , \u201d assessing all \u201c appropriate inputs , \u201d and \u201c observing the constraints \u201d imposed by the text and precedent in an attempt \u201c to figure out what the words mean as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote them.\n\u201d The fact that Jackson felt the need to dress up her arguments up in originalist language suggests that she is closer to Kagan than Sonia Sotomayor , an ideologue who reasons backwards from substantive commitments with little regard for the text .\nIf Jackson is closer to Kagan than Sotomayor , Roberts could have a second compromise vote to offset divisions among the Court \u2019 s conservatives .\nThe conservatives on the Court often find themselves in agreement\u2014each of the Court \u2019 s conservatives justices were in the majority in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 2020 term .\nBut they also disagree among themselves on important issues that have strategic implications for the compromise-minded John Roberts .\nClarence Thomas has been the lone dissenter in otherwise-unanimous decisions 30 times in his decades on the bench .\nUnlike Antonin Scalia , Thomas has no scruples about overturning shoddy precedents .\n\u201c When faced with a demonstrably erroneous precedent , \u201d Thomas wrote , \u201c my rule is simple : We should not follow it.\n\u201d Thomas has even called for the disincorporation the establishment clause of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a textualist , it is hard to argue with his reasoning . )\nSamuel Alito , like Thomas , is willing to dissent from his colleagues from the right .\nHe wrote a fiery dissent in Bostock v. Clayton County , which extended Title VII protections under the 1964 Civil Rights Act to gay and transgender employees ; Neil Gorsuch authored the majority opinion .\nGorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh are more \u201c gettable \u201d for the Court \u2019 s liberal minority and liberal plaintiffs than are Thomas and Alito .\nGorsuch has libertarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s liberals in criminal-justice cases .\nKavanaugh is a Roberts fanboy .\nHe reportedly had a blown-up picture of himself and John Roberts on the wall of his D.C .\nCircuit chambers .\nKavanaugh rarely stakes out unpopular positions ; he was in the majority in 97 percent of cases heard in the Court \u2019 s 2020 term , far and away the highest proportion of any of the nine justices .\nHe was more likely to rule with Kagan ( 67.7 percent ) and Stephen Breyer ( 69.4 percent ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 66.1 percent ) .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think Thomas or Alito gives a s [ \u2014 ] what The New York Times says about them , \u201d one of Kavanaugh \u2019 s friends told the Atlantic .\n\u201c But I think Brett does.\n\u201d Perhaps this is true not only of Kavanaugh , but the chief justice himself .\nNoah Feldman of Harvard Law School argued that \u201c Roberts \u2019 s approach\u2026is to try to craft a middle ground that will make the Supreme Court seem less purely political than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservatives.\n\u201d Roberts \u2019 s desire to make the Court seem less \u201c political \u201d leads him to pursue compromise where justice demands clarity .\nWith a string of controversial cases on the Court \u2019 s docket this year on issues ranging from abortion to affirmative-action , Roberts could enlist Kagan and a future Justice Jackson to craft compromise verdicts with either Kavanaugh , Gorsuch , or Amy Coney Barrett .\nThe latter three justices were in the majority in more than 90 percent of the Court \u2019 s 2020 cases , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 81 percent ) were not .\nElena Kagan ( 75 percent ) was not far behind either Alito or Thomas .\nIf Jackson aligns herself with Kagan , it \u2019 s possible the compromise-minded Roberts turns to the pair of pragmatic liberal justices instead of the mavericks to his right .", "author": "John Hirschauer", "url": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/what-ketanji-brown-jackson-offers-john-roberts/", "published": "Tue, 29 Mar 2022

"theamericanconservative", "title": "Democracy Isn\u2019t Democratic", "content": "American political disputes often revolve around a dichotomy between democracy and authoritarianism .\nIn domestic policy disputes , the separate political parties use the rhetoric of that dichotomy against each other .\nEach party perceives the other as the party of authoritarianism , and describes itself as the party of democracy .\nDemocrats see the Republicans as the party that staged an insurrection in order to undermine an election , the party moving to restrict voting rights , etc .\nRepublicans see the Democrats as the party that stole an election , the party of big government , etc .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case of democracy v. authoritarianism .\nIn foreign policy , this dichotomy is not so straightforward , even though the rhetoric has long been present there in a bipartisan consensus .\nThe motivation for America \u2019 s many wars , invasions , and military operations abroad is \u201c to make the world safe for democracy , \u201d against the threat that supposedly lies in the authoritarian regimes of the Middle East and elsewhere .\nThe political parties are joined together in their commitment to changing those regimes\u2014by military force , if need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of history , whose direction is toward none other than liberty ( as President Bush so eloquently put it ) .\nImplicit in the bipartisan consensus that military intervention must stand ready to secure the globalization of democracy is a recognition of the fact that democracy can not stand alone .\nThe ugly truth is that democracy must be created and defined by highly undemocratic and even authoritarian means , hence \u201c regime change.\n\u201d The U.S. \u2019 s violent interventions in Afghanistan , Iraq , Libya , Syria\u2014not to mention the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Soviet Union , despite repeated assurances to the contrary\u2014demonstrate that even by the U.S. \u2019 s own calculations democracy can not be created without the use of authoritarian measures , up to and including the use of military violence or the threat thereof .\nOne is reminded in this of the words of Friedrich Engels , in a pamphlet titled On Authority , written against a group of anarchist socialists : \u201c A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is ; it is the act whereby one part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other part by means of rifles , bayonets and cannon \u2014 authoritarian means , if such there be at all ; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain , it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists.\n\u201d What is regime change but an act of revolution ?\nAnd what is the defense of democracy by a vast military alliance but an authoritarian reign of terror ?\nOn the one hand , America \u2019 s crusader-like commitment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betray the American liberal democratic ideal itself as nothing more than a fraud and a sham .\nThere have been many democratic societies throughout history , yet not all of them were so intent upon the coercive imposition of their democratic regime upon the rest of the world .\nFrom this point of view , one is rightly prompted to join certain critics of the United States , such as President Vladimir Putin of Russia , in denouncing it for imperialistic hypocrisy , as perhaps the worst offender against its own ideal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid the conclusion that the expansionist ambitions of the U.S. are largely to blame for the paranoia and suspicion displayed by the other great powers of the world , Russia and China , towards American hegemony .\nBut there is another conclusion to be drawn here .\nPerhaps democratic and authoritarian forms of governance are not , as they are usually portrayed , mutually exclusive ; on the contrary , they may be mutually codependent and reinforcing .\nWhether their codependence is good or bad is a separate question , one whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individual democracies and regimes .\nIrrespective of such individual cases , perhaps America is just one illustration of the eternal , inescapable truth that democracy\u2014or if you want to be vague about it , \u201c liberty \u201d \u2014always requires the backing of something that is , in itself , quite undemocratic .\nConsider the story of Athenian democracy , as told by Herodotus and Aristotle .\nThe regime that prevailed before the founding of Athenian democracy was heavily oligarchical and stratified by rigid class divisions .\nAs both Herodotus and Aristotle tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a popular revolution that was to be led by the great statesman , Cleisthenes , who was in a contest with the aristocrat Isagoras for the position of chief magistrate in Athens .\nDespite many significant setbacks , Cleisthenes rose to power because , in the words of Herodotus in book 5 of the Histories , he \u201c took the commonalty into partnership.\n\u201d In other words , he was what some today would call a \u201c populist.\n\u201d With the support of the lower classes ( even amounting at times to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution , throwing the aristocratic class out of power and implementing a major regime change in Athens .\nAs Aristotle recounts in the Athenian Constitutions , Cleisthenes dissolved the rigid system of class-based governance that formerly constituted the regime , divided the body politic into ten tribes rather than the previous four , and ordered a more equitable distribution of land and property among them .\nThese reforms , though they were imposed quasi-dictatorially , laid the groundwork for a more democratic system of governance .\n\u201c Democracy \u201d was born at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks that Cleisthenes was imitating the example of his grandfather and namesake , Cleisthenes the despot of Sicyon , who had similarly reordered the tribes of Sicyon in order to consolidate his dictatorship .\nThe case of Athens is one among many historic illustrations of Engels \u2019 observation that every revolution is an act of authoritarian coercion .\nDemocratic revolutions do not escape this assessment .\nThe liberation from tyranny in Athens could not have been accomplished without the quasi-dictatorial redistribution of power and property that Cleisthenes oversaw .\nDemocracies are built in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support and backing of authoritarian power .\nArguably , the same principle continues on in the subsequent history of any democracy after its founding : They are enshrined in constitutional forms whose parameters must be non-negotiable at some level and to some degree , in order for the democratic system itself to be sustainable .\nNone of this sheds any light on what is a good or a bad use of such power .\nEvery democracy may be founded by an act of authoritarian power , yet no two regimes are alike in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , in contrast to the democracy of Cleisthenes , American democratic regime change in the Middle East and elsewhere tends to serve not the interests of the global poor , but the global oligarchy , and especially the American oligarchy .\nIt follows that the most important question is how to exercise undemocratic authority for the good of the demos , that is the people , or for the common good .\nAll political questions must ultimately be resolved to the common good , which is fairly independent of specific questions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governance , the question is how a great power with effectively imperial reach can exercise that power for the good of the lesser powers for whom it bears much responsibility .\nWithin such a framework , there is more leeway for a wide diversity of regimes than even a liberal democratic framework seems to allow\u2014after all , given its track record in international relations , liberal democracy will apparently tolerate no regime other than itself .\nIn this , it shows itself to be just as authoritarian as the monsters it goes abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be reflected back onto questions of domestic policy , whether on issues of economic or cultural import .\nSince the riot of January 6 , the rhetoric of defending democracy has been increasingly extended to the domestic as well as foreign enemies of democracy .\n( Of course , the domestic enemies of democracy are simply the other political party and its leaders . )\nBut in light of the above , partisan disputes which have been framed within the false dichotomy of democracy and authoritarianism should be reoriented by the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e .\nfor the good of the demos .\nAbsent such a framework , there is a risk that policies enacted for the protection of democracy at home may in fact turn out to be merely thoughtless and even destructive uses of authority .\nDemocracy by itself isn \u2019 t democratic enough\u2014because it may merely disguise a more totalitarian form of authoritarianism .\nInternationally or at home , politics is always a question of using undemocratic authority democratically , i.e .\nfor the good of the people .\nJonathan Culbreath is a writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has appeared in publications such as The American

"theamericanconservative", "title": "Christians Lead the Way at NatCon Europe", "content": "Last week , the city of Brussels played host to a trio of conferences destined to shape the future of Europe : the European Council , NATO , and G-7 .\nLess visible , but perhaps equally consequential in the long run , was the congress of conservative speakers from 19 nations who assembled for the second NatCon Europe , gathering under the auspices of the Edmund Burke Foundation to debate \u201c The Future of the Nation-State in Europe.\n\u201d Like the other gatherings happening concurrently in the capital of the European Union , the conversation at NatCon was framed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine , which have put the traditional European order of nation-states to its most severe test since the close of World War II .\nSeveral talks were dedicated explicitly to the Ukraine crisis , and many other speakers alluded extensively to the lessons it had to offer for a national conservative agenda .\nEveryone seemed to recognize that behind the battles being waged on the plains of Ukraine was a deeper battle over the narrative that would frame Russia \u2019 s invasion , the lessons that the West must learn from it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ought to emerge on the other side of this crisis .\nAs Israeli political theorist Ofir Haivry noted in his speech , European elites are eager to seize Putin \u2019 s aggression as an opportunity to discredit the despised nationalists in their midst .\nIn their narrative , Putin is the arch-nationalist , and his invasion is exactly the sort of thing that you \u2019 d expect a nationalist foreign policy to produce .\nUkraine , in contrast , stands for the liberal democratic universalism at the heart of the E.U .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Western progressive values .\nIts invasion , so this story goes , proves more than ever the need for the European Union to continue its steady march toward \u201c ever-closer union , \u201d and embrace the role of a hyper-liberal super-state ready to resist autocracy wherever it may be found ( including among its own members ) .\nSuch elites have lost no time in branding national conservatives Putin apologists , boosters for his brand of chauvinistic gangsterism .\nThey might have been surprised , then , by the tenor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denounced Putin as an imperialist thug , and Russia as a power with whom \u201c no compromise is possible.\n\u201d Prime Ministers Mateusz Morawiecki of Poland and Janez Jan\u0161a of Slovenia called for unstinting solidarity with Ukraine .\nIndeed , from the perspective of the national conservatives gathered in Brussels last week , if anyone had cause to be outraged by Russia , it was them .\nOn this narrative , Putin was no nationalist , but fit the classic imperialist profile , heading up a massive multi-national empire and now hell-bent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine , \u201d said Richard Milsom , \u201c was invaded because it insisted on being a fully sovereign nation , rather than accepting semi-dependent status.\n\u201d Moreover , far from being martyrs for universal liberal values , Ukrainians were offering a sterling depiction of something we had almost forgotten : a fierce , courageous love of one \u2019 s fatherland .\nAs U.K. writer Henry George put it , they were \u201c fighting , like Horatius , for \u2018 the ashes of their fathers and the temples of their gods.\n\u2019 \u201d They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shared national loyalty and the consequences of European anomie .\nFar from reinforcing the need for a European superstate , or encouraging Europe \u2019 s leaders to double down on the utopian dreams of the 1990s , Putin \u2019 s invasion was a \u201c blast of reality , the end of the end of history , \u201d as Rodrigo Ballester put it .\nIt was a warning , if Western elites had still needed it after the rise of China , Brexit , Trump , and Covid , that liberal globalism was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph , and that investing in more McDonalds joints in Russia was no substitute for investing in guns and planes .\nIndeed , Ukrainian resistance and Russian failures were proof that guns and planes were of little use without a proud fighting spirit .\nGermany , with an economy ten times that of Ukraine , likely would not have fared as well , one speaker remarked .\nAfter years of coddling their citizens with worries about \u201c micro-aggressions , \u201d Europe was woefully underprepared to face real aggressions .\n\u201c It \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent countries , \u201d lamented Spanish political essayist Jorge Hern\u00e1ndez , \u201c it \u2019 s that we lack the moral resources to be so.\n\u201d Clearly , then , the answer to this crisis is not more of the same that got us here ( an E.U .\nthat dissolves national boundaries ) .\nRather than leaning further into the idea of a European super-sovereign with a European army , the speakers advised , European leaders should strengthen their own nations and collaborate through intergovernmental ( rather than supergovernmental ) organizations like NATO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States to bail them out , advised conference organizer Yoram Hazony , it was high time for the Europeans to grow up and shoulder the burdens of their own regional security .\nAmerica , he insisted , had bigger fish to fry\u2014like facing down Xi \u2019 s China .\nTo date , however , even in the midst of its greatest crisis of this generation , E.U .\nleadership has doubled down on its own form of imperialism .\nScarcely less frequent than lamentations for Ukraine were expressions of indignation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctions \u201d against Hungary and Poland for their supposed violations of the rule of law .\n\u201c Shame on those 478 MEPs who found the time to divide Europe when the drums of war were pounding , \u201d fulminated Ballester .\nPolish MEP Anna Fotyga and Hungarian MEP Bal\u00e1zs Hidv\u00e9ghi called the sanctions \u201c political blackmail \u201d and noted the irony that these eastern European countries were being denounced for their intolerance and violations of European values even as they opened their borders to the floods of Ukrainian refugees .\nAlthough the E.U @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial penalties on its recalcitrant members because of their failures to guarantee independent courts , the speakers at NatCon had no doubt that the real cause was Hungary and Poland \u2019 s failure to toe the line of Western woke orthodoxy on abortion and LGBT issues .\nFrom this vantage point , E.U .\nleadership \u2019 s own form of imperialism may have been less bloody than Putin \u2019 s but was just as sinister in the long run .\nBoth were violating national rights of self-determination and attempting to force a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe .\nAs Hazony put it in his keynote , \u201c An empire asks , \u2018 Why should they be free to make their own laws when we already know what the best laws are ?\n\u201d The nationalist , on the other hand , recognizes the right of each nation to determine where its own national interest lies and how to pursue it .\nThe nationalist , moreover , will perceive that the lessons of the past few years , far from pointing toward the necessity of \u201c ever closer union , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ideals of both national sovereignty and national independence .\nWhereas the steady growth of E.U .\ninstitutions has progressively infringed the formal legal sovereignty of its constitutive nation-states , these have no one but themselves to blame for their loss of economic independence .\nTransfixed by the illusion of frictionless global integration , many European nations have , like the United States , almost completely outsourced vital sectors of their economy .\nAs Italian think tank leader Francesco Giubelei observed , Covid-19 was a deafening wake up call to the shortsightedness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country and many other Western nations found themselves almost completely dependent on China for basic medical supplies in the midst of national emergency .\nNow , less than two years later , the same sorry saga is playing out again as the Ukrainian war exposes the folly of dependence on Russian oil and gas .\nAs his Spanish fellow panelist Juan \u00c1ngel Soto observed , \u201c Conservatives are sometimes branded as protectionists .\nI would submit that this is not the case .\nWe are just not stupid.\n\u201d Of course , commonsensical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not hard to imagine a cogent objection : How is this sort of nationalism not merely liberal individualism writ large ?\nMany conference speakers , after all , were loud in their denunciation of the liberal ideal of the free , untrammeled , and self-determining individual , free to chart and pursue his own vision of the good without either the help or the hindrance of his fellow man or any higher authority .\nWasn \u2019 t their ideal of the sovereign and self-determining nation simply Lockean man writ large ?\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , when Locke set out to describe his idea of the state of nature , in which individuals forged their own paths unconstrained by any human power , he explained that this was the state in which sovereign nations already found themselves .\nIndeed , it was a truism of early modern political thought that a lawless \u201c state of nature \u201d governed the relationships between states .\nWhy , the skeptic might ask , should such anarchy be healthy at the level of nation-states if it is harmful to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put another way , if it is beneficial for individuals to surrender their sovereignty and band together into political societies , why shouldn \u2019 t it be equally beneficial for nations to surrender their sovereignty and band-together into transnational superstates , like the E.U.\n?\nThe great Swiss jurist Emer de Vattel raised this question in his 1758 The Law of Nations , only to decisively reject its premise .\nAn individual and a nation , he argued , have little in common : \u201c Individuals are so constituted , and are capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they can scarcely subsist without the aid and the laws of civil society.\n\u201d Nations , on the other hand , while they can certainly benefit from larger associations , are self-sufficient when it comes to necessities\u2014or ought to be .\nThe larger the community , the more quickly a point of diminishing returns is passed between the benefits and costs of surrendering sovereignty .\nThis is a compelling answer , but we may offer a deeper one .\nWhereas the contemporary liberal individual celebrates the transcendence of all limits , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself , the nation-state is constituted by the given , rather than the chosen .\nAlthough the borders which limit it may have been somewhat arbitrary in the beginning , they come to constitute one of the deepest and most durable realities in human life , as the experience of Ukraine confirms .\nIn a world that longs for finitude , the existence of nation-states is a powerful reminder that flourishing depends on limits , and a powerful rebuke to the godlike aspirations of modern man .\nIn one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer Alex Kaschuta observed that for the dominant liberal ideology , every chosen difference between us is all-important , and every unchosen difference must be minimized or hidden in shame .\nThose individuals who succeed most thoroughly in shedding the unchosen bonds of birth and nature\u2014like the transgender individual\u2014are celebrated as heroes , while those retrogrades who embrace their biology\u2014like the homemaking mother of five\u2014are scorned as contemptible .\nIn such an age , nothing can be more refreshingly countercultural than the unapologetic nation-state , which celebrates the unchosen bonds of shared birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its identity .\nIt is in these national differences , of culture , language , and geography , that we can find the appropriate opportunity to \u201c celebrate diversity , \u201d not in the arbitrary and frivolous fantasies of the self-indulgent late modern individual .\nThis international nationalism , or resurgent Europeanism , would insist on holding diversity in unity in a way that the current E.U .\nproject has increasingly failed to do .\nAs Hungary \u2019 s Justice Minister , Judit Varga , explained in her keynote address , \u201c We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich contribution to the diversity of European unity.\n\u201d In the early steps toward the European Union , indeed , it had been understood that whatever the common culture and common interests motivating European cooperation , this must be a cooperation of distinct , diverse , sovereign , and independent nation-states .\nIf the E.U .\ncould move back in that direction , instead of seeking to impose a stifling uniformity and top-down bureaucracy on its members , most speakers seemed to suggest , they would be more than happy continuing the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their nations as proud participants .\nClearly , the nationalism articulated at this conference was not of the jingoistic go-it-alone variety .\nBut the internationalism called for at the conference differed from the reigning E.U .\northodoxy in one more crucial respect : It was organized , to a frankly startling extent , around the forthright re-assertion of Christian faith and Christian culture .\nOne of the youngest and also one of the most powerful of the conference \u2019 s many speakers , Eva Vlaardingerbroek of the Netherlands , put it unapologetically : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Jesus of Nazareth , whom we Christians call the Prince of Peace.\n\u201d Both she and Hazony argued that the reason European conservatives have kept losing is because they have been too afraid to talk about God or Scripture .\nNo longer .\nExcept perhaps Ukraine , no other theme was so prominent at the conference .\nSpeaker after speaker highlighted the central contributions of Christianity to European civilization , and the indispensability of a return to it if there was any chance of a viable European project that could serve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the continent \u2019 s rich mosaic of nations .\nRod Dreher , one of the few Americans present , told of the central role that the relics of European Christian culture had played in his own conversion , and warned , \u201c the only way Europe and the entire West will survive this civilizational crisis as Europe is by rediscovering and living out the Christian faith.\n\u201d Hungary \u2019 s Varga commended her nation \u2019 s new constitution , which explicitly affirms its Christian roots : \u201c Christianity is the foundation-stone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address on day two was given by the prominent Finnish politician Paivi Raisanen , an evangelical Christian currently being prosecuted for hate speech on account of her willingness to simply quote the Bible \u2019 s teaching on sexuality .\nOne of the final speakers , Irish human rights lawyer Lorcan Price , wryly joked : \u201c Many people here have used the term \u2018 created order , \u2019 which is an incredibly transphobic term.\n\u201d To the cynic , all this in-your-face Christian propaganda might look like merely the arbitrary substitution of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another .\nBut it is not .\nFor one thing , the idea of Christian Europe has history on its side .\nAs Dreher remarked , and no American visitor to Europe can fail to appreciate , the reminders of Christian civilization can be seen on almost every street corner , or towering above every skyline in breathtaking Gothic spires .\nPolitical and legal historians also know well just how thoroughly Christian principles remain woven through the warp and woof of European institutions , however rapidly this generation \u2019 s liberal elites might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , although Christian Europe has certainly had its fair share of imperialist moments , the recognition of finitude is inherent to the Christian faith in a way it is certainly not for woke liberalism .\nProgressives may frantically exhort us to \u201c respect difference \u201d and \u201c celebrate diversity , \u201d but their creed , in truth , has no idea how .\nThe venerable tradition of Christian democracy , on the other hand , understands well how , within the recognition of the limits imposed by creation and history , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloom .\nIndeed , several speakers suggested , as new \u201c hate speech \u201d law is increasingly used by E.U .\ncourts to silence all dissent , a return to Christian civilization may now be needed to save liberal values like free speech from hyper-liberalism \u2019 s imperial excesses .\nSome might wonder if all this talk of \u201c Christian civilization \u201d isn \u2019 t quixotic at best and delusional at worst .\nIn many parts of western Europe , God has been dead for over a century , and Raisanen \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the mere expression of Christian beliefs and values in many corners of the continent .\nTo be sure , one speaker observed , Western Europe may no longer have the resources for its own regeneration .\nThankfully , however , in some of the nations of central and eastern Europe\u2014so well-represented at the conference\u2014the flame of faith is burning bright again , after decades of communist repression .\nLess likely to underestimate the precious worth of religion after seeing the consequences of its forcible erasure from public life , nations like Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps to

the recent passage of a West Virginia law that penalizes banks for discriminating against fossil-fuel companies .\nProgressives , with the assistance of the Biden administration , have succeeded in pushing JPMorgan Chase , Citibank , Bank of America , Wells Fargo , and other major banks into left-wing activism , shunning industries including oil and gas producers and gun manufacturers , and fighting conservative state laws on issues like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states are joining together to fight back .\nOn March 30 , West Virginia enacted a law , Senate Bill 262 , which empowers its state treasurer to disqualify any bank that discriminates against fossil fuel producers from state contracts for underwriting municipal bonds , payments services , and other business .\n\u201c If banks want to continue to boycott the fossil-fuel industry , they have the right to do that , \u201d said West Virginia State Treasurer Riley Moore .\n\u201c We also have a right not to do business with them.\n@

direction they \u2019 re going to go.\n\u201d \u201c We \u2019 re not going to take this lying down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banks ] are implementing policies that , at least in our state , large majorities of people are not okay with.\n\u201d States have weapons beyond the imposition of municipal fees .\nIn pushing a unified \u201c net-zero \u201d climate agenda , banks \u201c are operating as an illegal cartel that is colluding to dry up financing to responsible American energy producers , \u201d said Jason Isaac of the Texas Public Policy Institute .\nThat could make them the subject of anti-trust lawsuits .\nA white paper by Washington , D.C. , law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view .\nIt states : In November , Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich launched an investigation into progressive banking practices that amount to \u201c inappropriate pressure and anticompetitive conduct , \u201d and include \u201c threatening and intimidating companies if they do not comply with their left-wing agenda.\n\u201d In addition to energy production , states are pushing back against banks that discriminate against firearms manufacturers .\nJPMorgan Chase , Citigroup , and Bank of America were recently blocked from municipal deals in Texas and Louisiana for this reason .\nWithin the $ 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second largest issuer after California .\nBanks \u201c are shutting out a Constitutionally protected industry , \u201d said Mark Oliva , a director at the National Shooting Sports Foundation , a gun-rights advocacy .\n\u201c This is the privatization of Operation Choke Point , \u201d an illicit operation under the Obama administration that used the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , a banking regulator , to threaten banks who lend to the gun industry .\n\u201c Banks are unaccountable to the electorate , \u201d Oliva said .\nRather than pass laws democratically through elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through faceless , nameless corporate board rooms on Wall Street.\n\u201d Progressives have targeted the banking industry because it is uniquely powerful\u2014its control over America \u2019 s savings , capital , and payments systems gives banks the ability to shut down companies and individuals virtually overnight .\nThey demonstrated this power in February when Canadian banks froze the personal accounts of protesting truckers and their supporters , instantly cutting people off from their savings and their ability to buy food or pay bills .\nBanking services are \u201c at the center of everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor at South Texas College of Law .\nHe cites as an example conservative organizations that are cut off from payment services like WePay ( owned by JPMorgan ) , Shopify , or PayPal .\n\u201c Once you make it impossible to buy and sell and transact money , you basically starve that company to death.\n\u201d Fitzpatrick threatened that Missouri would stop doing business with JPMorgan Chase over this practice in November when its subsidiary WePay abruptly cut off payment services to a conservative conference organized by Defense of Liberty , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt , and U.S. Rep. Jason Smith .\nWePay was unable to cite any violation of its policies that led to the sudden shutdown , which caused the cancellation of the event .\nBeyond denying banking services , banks have also taken sides in the abortion debate , with Citigroup offering to pay travel and lodging for any Texas employee who went outside the state to avoid Texas \u2019 s recently passed fetal-heartbeat law , which allows private citizens to sue those providing or aiding abortions after a fetal heartbeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these companies will risk crippling civil liability in order to virtue signal that they support these various causes .\nCitigroup is taking a substantial financial risk , \u201d Blackman said .\nAccording to the Texas heartbeat law , any private citizen can sue Citigroup if employees accept its offer .\nIn response to Citigroup \u2019 s abortion policy , state Rep. Briscoe Cain last week threatened to introduce legislation that would bar the bank from underwriting municipal bonds in Texas .\nThe Biden Administration has lent its full support to progressive bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) enacted rules to compel banks to lend purely according to economic criteria and not ideology .\nTrump \u2019 s Labor Department simultaneously mandated that state pension funds invest only according to their fiduciary responsibility to generate returns for their retirees , rather than on ideological grounds .\nThe Biden administration has overturned both of these policies , opening the way for the politicization of America \u2019 s financial system .\nIn addition , Biden \u2019 s climate envoy John Kerry has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment to climate-friendly finance .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a complete sea change in terms of what the Biden Administration is attempting to do , \u201d Fitzpatrick said , \u201c using their regulatory power to force ESG [ Environmental , Social and Governance ] practices \u201d on banks and pension funds .\n\u201c It really goes beyond what the role of these agencies and the federal government is , \u201d he said .\n\u201c What it \u2019 s resulting in is discrimination by financial institutions against entire industries.\n\u201d Banks don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government , however .\nThe banking industry fought against Trump \u2019 s OCC regulation that discouraged ideological lending , and they have been fighting against state legislation that penalizes them for progressive activism .\n\u201c We had the Bankers Association come out against the [ fossil-fuel-protection ] bill \u201d in West Virginia , Moore said .\n\u201c That ended up being a pretty big fight , which we were able to overcome.\n\u201d Bette Grande , state-government-relations manager at the Heartland Institute and a former North Dakota legislator , said banks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very same time that they are fighting laws to prevent this practice , and their mission statements and public statements tout their commitment to fighting climate change and supporting gun control .\n\u201c They \u2019 re now in a place where in order to compete for business they have to walk their statements back or say what they said meant something else , \u201d Fitzpatrick said .\n\u201c They can lie all they want , \u201d Grande said , \u201c but it \u2019 s on their website that they are doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discriminating ] , why are they so pissed off that legislators are calling them out on it ?\n\u201d Beyond discrimination , there is also the role banks play in collecting and analyzing personal data .\nThe Biden administration \u2019 s attempt to have the IRS scrutinize every banking transaction over $ 600 , along with the warrantless data-mining of customers \u2019 personal bank accounts by Bank of America after the January 6 , 2021 , riot in Washington , D.C. , raise questions about privacy rights for bank customers .\nThe locking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quell political dissent \u201c set off alarms , \u201d Fitzpatrick said .\n\u201c That \u2019 s a page of

@ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATO into combat , Biden sent a clear signal to Putin that , if he is willing to make the effort and use his overwhelming military advantage , he will win .\nPutin \u2019 s goal is to create a sort of buffer state between Russia and NATO ; Putin can win whether Kiev rules or tumbles .\nA \u201c win \u201d for the U.S. side requires Putin to retreat in shame .\nBreaking things is

Russians run out of shells and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be skeptical of claims that 15,000 Russians have died in Ukraine .\nThat would be double the Americans killed on Iwo Jima , or on both sides at Gettysburg .\nIt would equal ten years of Russian losses in Afghanistan , and be about four times the total U.S. losses in Iraq .\nUkraine also claims to have killed six generals , six more than were killed in all the wars the U.S. has fought since World War Two .\nThe theory of sanctions is that they will place such as squeeze on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to withdraw from Ukraine .\nPutin , otherwise portrayed as a dictator who answers to no one , will supposedly listen to these men complain about their yachts and reverse a foreign policy that he otherwise believes benefits Russia in the long run .\nThe U.S. has been piling sanctions on these same oligarchs for decades , with a new round each time Putin moved against Georgia , Grozny , and Crimea .\nNone of those sanctions compelled a withdrawal and none have stopped Putin from making his subsequent move against Ukraine .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ creativity : There \u2019 s a plan to strip Putin \u2019 s \u201c Eva Braun \u201d ( you can \u2019 t make this up ) of her Olympic medals in hopes she \u2019 ll withhold nooky Lysistrata-like until Putin withdraws .\nAnother problem with sanctions is they are nowhere near strong enough to actually hurt .\nGoofy yacht warfare aside , Biden \u2019 s ban on Russian petroleum accounts for only some 1 percent of Russia \u2019 s output .\nNATO allies are not able to participate fully without crippling their own economies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the problem .\nHaving grown accustomed to casually slapping sanctions on defenseless countries like North Korea , Biden has limited understanding of the effects of sanctions on a globally connected economy .\nSuch sanctions have the potential to cause grave fallout because unlike , say , Cuba , Russia can fight back .\nThough the goal of sanctions is to punish specific Russians , known by name , in a position to influence Putin , concern from world markets drove up prices of crude oil , natural gas , wheat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gold .\nGrain and metals shortages now loom , even in early days of this spillover effect .\nBiden seems unaware that the world is interconnected .\nMillions are at risk of starvation in Africa if grain exports dry up .\nWhile the cost of these sanctions to oligarchs is unknown , the effect on economies the U.S. should be courting , not hurting , is clear .\nCentral Asia \u2019 s economies are now caught up in sanctions shock .\nThese former Soviet states are strongly connected to the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey will be as likely to blame the U.S. as Russia for their problems , converting potential U.S. allies into adversaries .\nWe have also yet to see what counter-moves Russia will make toward the West , to include nationalization of Western capital .\nRussian fertilizer export restrictions are putting pressure on global food production .\nRussia could also restrict exports of nickel , palladium , and industrial sapphires , needed for batteries , catalytic converters , and microchips .\nBiden is in the process of discovering sanctions are a blunt instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic challenge of keeping the economic fallout from spilling over into political dissent across Europe\u2014a region that is already unsure where it stands on \u201c tough \u201d sanctions .\nBad as all that sounds , some of the worst blowback from Biden \u2019 s Ukraine policy is happening in China .\nDuring the only Cold War years Biden apparently remembers , China was mostly a sideshow and certainly not vying to be the world \u2019 s largest economy .\nBy failing to understand that the world is no longer bipolar\u2014NATO versus the Pact\u2014Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm than he understands right now .\nRussia is a big country that has committed only a small portion of its military to the war in Ukraine .\nIt absolutely does not need Chinese help to prosecute the war , as Biden claims .\nBiden is unnecessarily antagonizing China , who should be more or less neutral in this fight but instead is being positioned by Biden as an enemy of the United States and an ally of Russia .\nChina buys oil from Russia but that does not translate into some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u00e0 la 1975 .\nYet Biden\u2014by threatening China with sanctions , linking Ukraine and Taiwan , and essentially demanding Beijing be with us or against us\u2014threatens to turn China the wrong way .\nBeijing has , for example , already asked the Saudis to accept yuan over dollars for oil .\nEconomic spillover from Russia is one thing , disturbing one of the world \u2019 s largest trading relationships is another .\nAs the Wall Street Journalpoints out , China \u2019 s basic approach of not endorsing Moscow \u2019 s aggression but resisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global support .\nOf the ten most populous countries in the world , only the U.S. supports major economic sanctions against Russia .\nIndonesia , Nigeria , India , and Brazil have all condemned the Russian invasion , but do not seem prepared to implement the West \u2019 s preferred countermeasures .\nQuite the opposite , in fact .\nIndia and Russia will soon have currency swaps in place to finance trade in rupees and rubles , bypassing the U.S. sanctions regime against Russia .\nBiden seems oblivious to these gaps in U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diplomat I heard often from smaller countries \u2019 representatives about the \u201c America Tax , \u201d the idea America \u2019 s unpredictable foreign-policy dalliances end up costing everyone something .\nWhether it is a military contribution to the Iraq War effort , or a disruption in shipping , nobody gets away free when America is on a crusade .\nThis cost is built in to those smaller nations \u2019 foreign policy .\nBut when the Big Blind Dog , as a Canadian diplomat once characterized the U.S. , starts in on sanctions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calculus changes .\nSmaller nations no longer offer a knowing sigh\u2014the Americans are at it again .\nThey feel real fear .\nMany nations the U.S. needs in its alliances don \u2019 t trust our ability to manage or protect them from economic consequences , if America is even aware of those consequences .\nAs America seeks to weaponize the global economic system , other nations fear U.S. moves against Russia \u2019 s central bank could one day be directed against them .\nRussia can weather a nasty storm ; a smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about

about Ukraine .\nEvery world problem is not America \u2019 s to resolve , and every world problem can not be resolved by America .\nIf he persists in his quixotic quest to defeat Putin , Biden may

meant to be a profession .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to make state legislators even more inaccessible .\nWhen my great grandpa , Cleveland Gupton , ran for the Nebraska State Legislature , it wasn \u2019

1952 , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was appointed to the Nebraska State Legislature .\nHe cast votes related to testing livestock for disease , banning the use of garbage to feed cows , and increasing \u201c

thought that to add to my family \u2019 s legacy of political pursuits , I would need to join the College Democrats , work on every campaign that would have me , and avoid writing anything anywhere

professional legislatures appear to be more responsive to policy needs .\nThree Oregon State legislators recently retired because they claimed the job demanded too much given its low pay .\nSome people would probably cite this as proof that high-quality public servants can \u2019 t last in a job that requires so much .\nHowever , the marginal pay reflects the fact that legislators aren \u2019

is putting his money where his mouth is .\nA federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has taken a 9 percent stake in Twitter , making the Tesla boss the social-media giant \u2019 s single largest shareholder .\nThe move followed several tweets over the past few months in which Musk hinted he is unhappy with the state of free speech on the platform .\nMost recently , he tweeted a poll in which he proposed that \u201c free speech is essential to a functioning democracy \u201d and asked his 80 million followers whether they \u201c believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle.\n\u201d Seventy percent of respondents voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s general tendency to defy various liberal orthodoxies , and it \u2019 s no wonder some free-speech advocates are jubilating .\nBut conservatives , and others who have faced Big Tech censorship , might hold the hosannas .\nAfter all , faith in the genius or benevolence of market actors like Musk is what got us here in the first place .\nTwitter censorship is ultimately a structural and political problem , and such problems demand political solutions .\nNow , I should start by admitting that I have underestimated Musk in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote a column for Commentary under a headline of my own composition , \u201c Crazy Rich Charlatans , \u201d which at the time I thought very clever indeed .\nIn it , I used the occasion of Musk \u2019 s smoking a joint with Joe Rogan to suggest that his success was owed almost entirely to his ability to play to the American business class \u2019 s psychic yearning for an Eccentric Visionary type\u2014one financially and technologically dedicated to solving climate change , no less .\nThis was around the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tesla private , which had sent shares tumbling ( only to recover spectacularly in the coming years ) .\n\u201c Musk , \u201d I wrote then , \u201c embodied the ideological proposition that no modern problem eludes solution by noble-minded technocratic elites .\nThe market , it turns out , was as prone to magical thinking as any of the rest of us.\n\u201d That was wrong .\nClearly , I \u2019 m no business guru , and on the off-chance Musk is a reader of The American Conservative , I offer him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charlatan .\nIt doesn \u2019 t take a keen sense for \u201c chasing alpha , \u201d however , to determine whether Musk can save freedom of speech online and democracy just by staking out the right positions in his astronomically large stock portfolio .\nOf course , one wishes that were true , and it is certainly better than not for a dogged critic of Twitter \u2019 s censorious practices to have a major seat at the Twitter table .\nBut sober analysis gives the better of the argument to skeptics like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c The messaging control Twitter now ensures is too important to DC power centers to let it go without a huge fight .\nI doubt even Elon Musk could just convert it back into a free-speech platform without some major war.\n\u201d Indeed , Twitter and Facebook started out as \u201c free-speech platforms.\n\u201d Before Musk , there were Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg , men with even bigger stakes in their respective firms and committed to using technology to smash the old gatekeepers of public discourse .\nThat was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when all but a few cynics ( such as the prophetic leftist writer Evgeny Morozov ) hailed the technology \u2019 s \u201c liberatory \u201d potential .\nSocial media , we were told , would empower activists and \u201c citizen-journalists \u201d the world over , toppling autocratic regimes and holding accountable brick-and-mortar institutions in democratic societies .\nSomehow , we ended up with today \u2019 s platforms , with their periodic purges of wrong-thinkers ( including a U.S. president ) , their obnoxious and ideologized \u201c fact-checking \u201d mechanisms , and their abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news-breakers and whistleblowers .\nNot least the New York Post , the nation \u2019 s oldest daily paper , which had its content banned and its Twitter account suspended for reporting what the prestige press now unanimously confirms was true : Hunter Biden traded on his paternal connections to enrich his family .\nSo what happened ?\nThe answer isn \u2019 t complicated .\nThere is a power structure in this country\u2014a tangle of private capital

including social media , will always reflect the social and political balance of forces .\nWe should of course wish Musk well .\nBut starting with enforcement of this nation \u2019 s venerable antitrust laws , and reform of the legal architecture that permits Big Tech firms to act as censorious publishers without any of a traditional publisher \u2019 s liability , the surer path to online

even talk of civil war .\nWhat is driving such a strange development in American politics ?\nAn attempt to transform this country into an ideological state .\nHistory is familiar with ideological states , states where dissent from the official ideology is dangerous : the Soviet Union , Communist China , Fascist Italy , National Socialist Germany , etc .\nAt times , various ideologies have attempted to draw in Americans , with some temporary success .\nFortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves on the country\u2014until now .\nBy the nature of ideology itself , all ideologies seek a totalitarian state .\nEvery ideology says that , on the basis of this or that set of abstract ideas , certain things must be so : only Aryans can do anything right and Jews are inherently evil ; everything is determined by ownership of the means of production and the bourgeoisie is evil ; modern Italy can be a new Rome and only Italians can make good coffee , etc .\nInvariably , reality contradicts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideologues respond by outlawing discussion of the contradictions .\nFreedom of thought and expression are deadly threats to ideologies , and are therefore every ideology \u2019 s first targets .\nThe ideology now attempting to impose itself on America is cultural Marxism , Marxism translated from economic into cultural terms by a think tank established in Germany in 1923 , the Institute for Social Research , commonly known as the Frankfurt School .\n( Those wanting a quick introduction to the Frankfurt School can find it on YouTube under \u201c History of Political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of history is determined by which groups , defined by race , sex and sexual orientation , have power over which other groups .\nWhites , males , and straights have been on top , so they are \u201c oppressors , \u201d while some ( not all ) other races , women , and gays have been \u201c victims.\n\u201d All Marxism is loser-worship ; cultural Marxism just redefines the losers .\nIts goal is to empower blacks , feminist women ( only feminists ) , gays , etc.\n, over straight white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambitions of cultural Marxism , all he needs to do is look at most university campuses .\nDissenters from cultural Marxism , student or faculty , are persecuted .\nMore broadly , in today \u2019 s America you can not be a member of the elite if you defy the aspiring state ideology .\nNot surprisingly , many Americans , probably a majority , reject cultural Marxism and its attempts to make them mouth lies .\nWe \u2019 ve seen that lately in parents \u2019 efforts to keep critical race theory out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is being taught are lies ; the whole of public schools \u2019 curricula are shaped by the Frankfurt School \u2019 s critical theory , of which CRT is a subset . )\nThese Americans are not looking for a fight , but they will fight before they bow and scrane to cultural Marxism .\nThe cultural Marxists , in turn , regard any dissenters as not merely wrong but evil .\nThey may not be tolerated , rather they must be \u201c canceled \u201d : fired from their jobs , banned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes physically attacked .\nThey are \u201c unpersons.\n\u201d Only through a groveling \u201c apology \u201d can their existence again be recognized .\nTrump voters , and millions of Americans who did not vote for Trump , will reach for their rifles before they go down on their knees .\nWhile cultural Marxism is the ideological threat of the moment , another ideology , even more dangerous , is waiting in the wings ; extreme environmentalism , sometimes called \u201c Deep Green.\n\u201d Deep Green environmentalism sees man as a curse on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOther ideologies have called for liquidating this or that minority or social class ; Deep Green targets everyone .\nIt offers a perfect basis for totalitarianism because it argues that everything a person does , including eat and breathe , affects the environment .\nCurrently hiding under the wings of cultural Marxism , Deep Green ideology is waiting to come forth if its protector falters .\nAgain , tens of millions of Americans would rather fight than switch .\nAt present , no ideology from the right threatens freedom of thought and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such ideologies are possible ; fascism and national socialism are examples .\nLibertarianism is an ideology\u2014anyone who thinks free markets solve all problems should drive through a city that has no zoning\u2014but it appeals only to a small intellectual clan and by its own logic can not oppose freedom of thought and speech .\nConservatism is not an ideology .\nAs Russell Kirk wrote , it is the negation of ideology .\nIt rejects any and all attempts to remake man and society along lines dictated by some abstraction .\nIt seeks a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bottom up by the experience of many generations .\nIt manifests itself in customs , habits , and traditions , which vary widely from place to place , a variety conservatives embrace .\nFrom a conservative perspective , ideology itself , regardless of its tenets , is the ring of power in Tolkien \u2019 s trilogy .\nIn the long run , it can not be used for good , regardless of its promises .\nOur task is to bring our fellow citizens to see all ideologies as what they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppose them one and all .\nThat is a tall

\u201d usually results in disappointment .\nSo why is education ( for the moment ) different ?\nWhat lessons should Righties learn ?\nThe first lesson : You have better odds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you pick an issue lots of people are heavily invested in .\nThe more potential recruits you have , the better .\nAnd in the words of historian Robert Conquest \u2019 s First Law , as relayed in the memoirs of

agents of its opponents.\n\u201d ) Something lots of people know well is effective grounds for organizing .\nMost American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMost American parents themselves went to public schools .\nAmerican parents thus have reasonable expectations of public schools , and while they may have different values , they do overwhelmingly agree that kids who go to public school should actually learn to do things , like math .\nParents are discovering public schools are less invested in this outcome .\nAlarming numbers of public school teachers believe that \u201c rigor \u201d and \u201c accuracy \u201d are buzzwords for white supremacy , and that it \u2019 s more important for kids to vaguely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it \u2019 s possible for 2+2=5 than it is for them to be able to add two and two and get four in everyday life .\nThis is the sort of thing that makes progressive white math teachers feel very good about themselves , but doesn \u2019 t help poor black kids grow up able to figure out how and where and for how much money a boss or a landlord or a bank or a government agency is ripping them off .\nNor does it help public-school students of any ethnicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mathematics of the sort that can lead to remunerative careers .\nThat last is what led to some backlash recently here in California .\nElites here trend left , but when \u201c reforms \u201d threatened advanced opportunities for public-school students to study calculus\u2014the sort of thing that California elites want their children to be able to do ( because a . )\nelites pride themselves on their children \u2019 s accomplishments in school and b . )\nsee above re : \u201c remunerative careers \u201d ) \u2014it was a bridge too far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included an open letter from over one thousand STEM professionals against the curriculum changes .\nThere are limits to what an open letter can do ; the result was delay , minor curriculum modifications\u2026and pretty much the same thing sailing forward .\nBut in California , elites objecting to some aspect of public education is noteworthy !\nEnergy and outrage alone aren \u2019 t enough to accomplish your goals , but a lot of people caring is the first step to recruiting them and turning them into an effective machine .\nThe second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your enemies are saying and doing .\nYou can \u2019 t talk about Righty success on the education front without mentioning Christopher Rufo \u2019 s efforts on that front .\nBut to get anything out of that , you have to look at what he \u2019 s doing .\nRighties have a tendency toward hero-worship : When somebody has success at something , we tend to say that person is awesome rather than asking what they are doing that is effective and can be emulated .\nRufo doesn \u2019 t just talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he talks about what woke education is , not in generalities , but in specifics , in jurisdiction after jurisdiction after jurisdiction .\nHe collects internal documents leaked by friendly insiders and gathered by himself from filing public-records requests , and posts them publicly .\nGathering detailed documentation is essential for effective counter-action , and it \u2019 s especially effective when your opponents are liars , e.g.\n, \u201c This isn \u2019 t happening.\n\u201d It \u2019 s totally happening ; here are examples !\n\u201c It \u2019 s not common.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of places all over the country ; here are more examples !\n\u201c This isn \u2019 t really Critical Race Theory.\n\u201d Here are documents saying it is !\nAnd so on .\nThe most important thing about Rufo \u2019 s or any other information-gathering activist \u2019 s work isn \u2019 t the activist himself , but what that work makes possible .\nDocumenting what your enemies say isn \u2019 t just an opportunity to call them liars or hypocrites , because calling people liars or hypocrites from across the country isn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNor is this one nationwide fight ( and face it , how effective have conservatives been at passing federal legislation that isn \u2019 t tax cuts ? )\n.\nIt \u2019 s a nationwide fight , and it \u2019 s 50 state fights , and it \u2019 s innumerable county and city fights .\nInformation-gathering activists can collect a lot of information and publicize it , but it \u2019 s when locals form lasting groups that they can use that information to create pressure locally\u2026and then upward .\nThat leads us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and within the structure you \u2019 re trying to change .\nHere \u2019 s a case study .\nWhen parents began increasingly complaining about the direction of schools to their local school boards , the National School Board Association released a letter equating parent involvement in schools as \u201c domestic terrorism.\n\u201d Parents very understandably added this to the list of things they complained about to their local school boards .\nThis was necessary and good .\nIt did not , however , automatically produce pressure on the national organization .\nDefiantly standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t do anything if the people you \u2019 re speaking to feel they can just ignore you .\nWhat did produce pressure on the national organization ?\nMultiple state groups nationwide began distancing themselves from the statement or even talking about disassociating from the national organization , which ( if enough did ) could weaken its power , prestige , and most importantly\u2014as the NSBA charged dues payments\u2014its finances .\nThese state chapter disavowals of the original letter were neither spontaneous nor organic responses .\nThey came because the group Parents Defending Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to stand by or disavow the comments , put their answers on a web site , and kept a running tally of disavowals .\nThe group also used public-records laws to obtain internal discussion of the letter and discovered the head of the NSBA had put it out without consulting the organization \u2019 s board .\nThis created internal pressure within the organization to add to the external pressure created by disassociation from state chapters .\nThe organization walked back the letter in an effort to mitigate this pressure from within and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many state-level chapters had left that it raised the question of whether the NSBA could legitimately be called a national organization .\n( It also raises the possibility of a new competing organization , if those separate chapters can come together to create one . )\nIt \u2019 s important to not just track your enemies , but to also , lesson four : Track your ostensible allies and yourself .\nThe school-choice activist Cory DeAngelis is a fun social-media follow because he merrily points out whenever a prominent figure who opposes taxpayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn \u2019 t send their own kids to public schools , or didn \u2019 t go to public schools themselves .\nWhat makes his Twitter feed useful and interesting , though , is his work tracking legislation : When a jurisdiction faces a vote over a bill to fund students instead of systems , he notes it .\nWhen the bill passes , he notes it .\nWhen the bill fails , he notes that , as well as who voted against it , highlighting those whose platforms or parties were ostensibly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that jurisdiction the information they need to challenge those candidates in future elections .\nRighties like full-throated grandstanders , but it doesn \u2019 t matter how onside people say they are if they don \u2019 t vote the right way\u2014so you need to keep track of how they vote , and pressure them or replace them if they fall short .\nAll of these individual efforts are important ,

Challenges", "content": "A former Florida pageant queen wants to represent Tennessee in Congress .\nThe state legislature says no , but the U.S. Constitution may say yes .\nNEW YORK , NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 23 : Morgan Ortagus , U.S. Department Of State Spokesperson , speaks onstage during the 2019 Concordia Annual Summit - Day 1 at Grand Hyatt New York on September 23 , 2019 in New York City .\n( Photo by Riccardo Savi/Getty Images for Concordia Summit ) A constitutional controversy is brewing in my home state of Tennessee .\nThe conundrum goes like this : Trump-backed candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s 5th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives .\nA former Bush appointee to the U.N. and Miss Florida Citrus , Ortagus only moved to Tennessee one year ago .\nThe objections surrounding the Floridian \u2019 s candidacy have been so loud that last Thursday , the Tennessee General Assembly passed legislation enacting new residency requirements for congressional primary candidates .\nThe Assembly \u2019 s law would require a congressional candidate to have lived in the state of Tennessee , and in the district he plans to represent , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his election , encouraging not just state but also local loyalty .\nHours later , three Ortagus supporters filed a lawsuit in Nashville \u2019 s federal court calling the bill\u2014which still awaits Gov .\nBill Lee \u2019 s signature , veto , or silent acceptance\u2014unconstitutional .\n\u201c Plaintiffs allege the bill , not yet law , would \u2018 blatantly \u2019 violate the Constitution , which outlines less stringent qualifications to qualify to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives .\nThe legislation would likely disqualify their \u2018 preferred \u2019 candidate , Morgan Ortagus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d reports the Tennessean .\nThe Wall Street Journal has already planted its flag , calling the law unconstitutional in an editorial last week .\nThe Journal cites the same reasons as the Nashville lawsuit , arguing that the Assembly \u2019 s requirements would be more stringent than those outlined in Article I , Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution .\nI \u2019 m no expert in constitutional interpretation , but since the bill may soon be law , it is worth taking a closer look .\nWe can imagine a plethora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founders didn \u2019 t include state residency as a requirement for elected officials in the Constitution , such as the fact that they feared the prospect of a weak national government more than a behemoth one .\nOr , we can look to Federalist No .\n52 , and Madison \u2019 s brief explanation of the requirements that distinguish the lower from the upper chamber : congressional elections should be open to anyone of merit , without regard to age , wealth , or religion .\nAll right , good .\nWhat about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the frequency of representatives \u2019 elections would preserve the candidate \u2019 s common interest with the people , their \u201c dependence and sympathy \u201d on and for those who elected them .\nI won \u2019 t bore you with how that has turned out ; you \u2019 re already living it .\nRegardless , it seems Madison was interested in preserving local loyalties , which other founders \u2019 sentiments confirm .\nExcept , we still have the problem of out-of-state opportunists trying their luck in districts where they can \u2019 t even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , not to mention a national electorate that is chronically ill-informed .\nWhat now ?\nThere is another argument against the Assembly \u2019 s bill , which has received almost as much air\u2014that the Tennessee General Assembly is engaging in political protectionism .\nYou know , insiders in smoky backrooms keeping out the fresh , dissenting voices .\nThis , if you \u2019 ll pardon my tone , is hogwash .\nFor one thing , political parties have set their own rules for candidate qualification for decades .\nThese rules aren \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly more stringent than the Section 2 requirement that a candidate have seven years \u2019 residency in the United States and be at least 25 years of age .\nThey certainly work to keep out candidates that may otherwise have been qualified .\nIf anything is protectionist , it is these rules , which work to enforce loyalty to a national two-party system , something the Constitution was supposed to help us avoid .\nBy contrast , the Tennessee General Assembly law would require a minute measure of state and district loyalty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region that a man would represent .\nThe Tennessee law sets a considerably lower threshold than it could have .\nBy the same standard , I could run to represent the state of Michigan in the U.S. House , and after four years of residency there I can say with confidence it is not half as much time as one would need to govern a place well .\nIn a nation as vast as ours , with states as diverse in character and concerns , it should not be controversial to set a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While we \u2019 re at it , we should make representatives spend more days a year in their districts than in Washington , so they can feel the effects of the laws they let pass . )\nIf the goal is fair representation , a residency requirement protects against unfair abuses by candidates who have garnered national recognition but know little about the district they \u2019 re campaigning in .\nHow many absurdly ignorant laws we could avoid by requiring a candidate to live as many as five years in a state before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born there\u2014we may never know .\nNot to mention the absurdly ignorant candidates who , having given the locals sufficient time to assess their character , would never make it past the petition stage to get on the ballot .\nBehind all of this is the question of loyalty , something that must be earned through proximity .\nThink about the fact that most candidates choose to live in the districts they represent , though there is currently no requirement to do so .\nIt is a recognized tradition that you should belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one we haven \u2019 t codified likely because it is one candidates have generally heeded , or felt the burn for not heeding at the ballot box .\nMuch has changed since 1787 , and as much as I like Florida , Florida \u2019 s problems are not Tennessee \u2019 s .\nLoyalty to either political party offers no comfort that a candidate will understand Tennesseans \u2019 concerns and represent them faithfully on the national stage .\nMy home state is a lot of things , but you could never call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the 5th Congressional District to know who Nathan Bedford Forrest is constitutes \u201c political protectionism , \u201d then give me a named chair in the club cigar

nominee Joe Biden , addresses the virtual convention on August 20 , 2020 .\nThe convention , which was once expected to draw 50,000 people to Milwaukee , Wisconsin , is now taking place virtually due to the coronavirus pandemic .\n( Photo by DNCC via Getty Images ) ( Photo by Handout/DNCC via Getty Images ) You hear ?\nThe emails on Hunter Biden \u2019 s laptop are real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times , the official mainstream media newspaper of the mainstream media , agrees .\nActually , the FBI agreed first , as they are in the middle of a criminal investigation into Hunter \u2019 s business activities and taxes based on the contents of the laptop .\nDespite the ongoing coverage of the emails outside establishment media , it was only the FBI \u2019 s investigation of the laptop that finally forced the Times to admit this year that what it said last year was bull .\nPolitico , based on a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , too , admits the emails are real , and not Russian disinformation as they claimed previously .\nNow that we can talk about the emails in polite company , what \u2019 s the big deal ?\nIs this just another case of buh , buh her emails ?\nWell , yes , but not in the way you may think .\nThe establishment worked diligently to hide , diminish , downplay , and muddle the story about Hillary Clinton \u2019 s emails before the 2016 election , and they did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2020 election .\nBoth are nefarious examples of the media regulating the information available to voters as they made their choice .\nIn Clinton \u2019 s case , knowledgeable people , experts in government classification , were forced to endure months of \u201c news \u201d speculating whether the Secretary of State \u2019 s official correspondence might contain classified information , or whether running one \u2019 s own unsecured email server out of a literal kitchen closet for official business was a bad idea , or whether deleting 30,000 pieces of potential evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill the story ( Hillary \u2019 s shifting excuses gave it new life at each turn ) the media softened the edges enough that when then-FBI Director James Comey disingenuously proclaimed Hillary innocent , the public was ready to move on .\nIn Hunter \u2019 s case the emails were buried , not merely diminished , by an establishment media that came to better understand its superpowers .\nThis power arises from interplay between the American intelligence services and corporate-media figures , working for the benefit of the Democratic Party .\nThat interplay\u2014awkward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking like the kid who went to prom alone\u2014came to maturity in 2020 .\nAs the New York Post broke the story that a laptop full of Hunter Biden \u2019 s files contained potential evidence of a pay-for-play scenario involving then-candidate Joe Biden just ahead of the presidential election , almost in real time more than 50 former senior intelligence officials signed a letter dutifully published by Politico claiming the emails \u201c have all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\n\u201d The signers said their national-security experience made them \u201c deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in this case .\nIf we are right this is Russia trying to influence how Americans vote in this election , and we believe strongly that Americans need to be aware of this.\n\u201d The letter was an act of evil brilliance .\nIt played off cultivated prejudices from 2016 that the Russians manipulated American elections .\nIn fact , most of the signatories\u2014James Clapper and John Brennan among them\u2014had played key roles in misdirecting public opinion around the DNC-server hack and later the whole of Russiagate .\nAmong the establishment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laptop is fake.\n\u201d The major difference in this case was the establishment \u2019 s willingness to actively block information .\nWith the letter as \u201c proof \u201d the laptop was disinformation , social media took the handoff .\nTwitter locked the New York Post \u2018 s account after the Post refused to obey Twitter \u2019 s orders to delete its own truthful reporting .\nTwitter even banned links to the story in direct messages .\nFacebook announced it would not allow discussion of the issue pending a \u201c fact check , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labeled the laptop fake , social media blocked the news , and the public basically fell in line and voted for Joe without knowing squat about what he and his son Hunter had been up to .\nTAC readers were not included in that seething heap of ignorance .\nTAC , alongside the New York Post and select other outlets , understood the emails were worthy of the public \u2019 s attention .\nWe published a dive into the laptop \u2019 s contents online in December 2020 , and a deeper dive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers got much of the same information even before the election .\nAs the contents of the laptop become more widely known , the intelligence community-establishment media-Democratic Party apparatus apparently was right to hide the Post \u2018 s reporting before the presidential election : Almost half of Americans now believe Trump would have won a second term if the media had fully reported on the laptop \u2019 s revelations .\nHiding the emails marks the second election controlled by the triumvirate of the intelligence community , establishment media , and Democratic Party .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joe Biden was elected and is very unlikely to run for a second term , do Hunter \u2019 s emails still matter ?\nThe answer is yes\u2014the laptop has a lot to tell us .\nThe emails matter because the way they were handled exposed , once again , the way your vote could be manipulated .\nYou need to understand the establishment \u2019 s techniques ahead of 2024 .\nThe emails matter because they are just the tip of the iceberg .\nWe already know Hunter did not report much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recently paid $ 1 million in back taxes .\nWe know he has federal fraud and illegal-foreign-representation charges pending .\nThere is more to come that could affect how people vote in 2024 .\nThe emails matter because they show Hunter was willing to kick in money to his father ( \u201c 10 percent for the big guy , \u201d read one email ) .\nThe two co-mingled their finances , shared bank accounts , and covered each other \u2019 s bills , all of which needs to be investigated .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked out of a bank account because his father was using it .\nIn a text , Hunter complained that he was required to give his father half of his money for an unspecified task .\nThe emails matter because they are primary evidence of possible criminal actions by Hunter that bump into Joe \u2019 s official work first as Obama \u2019 s V.P .\nand now as president .\nHunter Biden had extensive deals in Ukraine and China that conflict-of-interest laws demand be investigated .\nHunter took large sums of money from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father \u2019 s official portfolio as vice president , and took large sums of money from Chinese shell companies with ties to the CCP oligarchy .\nHunter performed no work in return for the money .\nThe emails matter because , in the case of the Chinese companies , Hunter appeared to launder money\u2014taking in six figures , skimming off a percentage , and handing the remainder over to a U.S.-based corporate entity associated with the Chinese organization .\nHe did that to get around the Chinese government \u2019 s currency-export regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Joe was involved in any of the same , and if any of this behavior is criminal .\nThe emails matter because they were potential blackmail fodder , and the FBI must find out if Hunter was tapped by any foreign intelligence service when his father was V.P .\nThe laptop contained evidence of Hunter \u2019 s filthy life , and actions that screamed to a foreign intelligence service , \u201c Blackmail me !\n\u201d Hunter \u2019 s laptop was chock-full of video showing him smoking crack .\nHunter spent money on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites , and big plays on all sorts of depravities .\nThe laptop contains correspondence referencing Hunter \u2019 s affair with his dead brother Beau \u2019 s widow .\nA lot of hard weekends on the hard drive .\nThe emails matter because the president of the United States says they do not matter .\nJoe Biden \u2019 s defense is sweeping : \u201c My son did nothing wrong.\n\u201d Joe also claims to know nothing about the involvement of his brother Jim , who helped son Hunter launder money .\nThat makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , or an accomplice in a cover-up , both 25th-Amendment territory .\nThis is especially important , as Joe ran on an anti-corruption platform against the Trump family .\nThe emails matter because they clearly show Hunter tried to sell access to his father , and no one has investigated whether or not he succeeded .\nAnd that \u2019 s it .\nThe emails matter not because they are a smoking gun , but because they provide a series of leads\u2014leads that deserve to be investigated and could produce a smoking gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c incomplete \u201d is to fail to understand the

in the interest of public health .\nThe pandemic clearly warranted such a measure , which is why the Trump administration \u2019 s CDC initially ordered its implementation , and why the Biden administration partially continued its enforcement .\nTo understand what termination of Title 42 means for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all other enforcement has been forsaken\u2014the Biden administration has , among other things , drastically cut back ICE enforcement in the interior and refused to follow a court order to implement Migrant Protection Protocols\u2014and the result is overwhelming numbers .\nSo bad , in fact , that the Biden administration has been working to conceal the damage , but the numbers don \u2019 t lie .\nIn fiscal year 2021 , the year Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas took office , DHS encountered more migrants at our southern border\u2014some 2 million apprehensions\u2014than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd of those , nearly 700,000 were released into the United

numbers are getting even worse , with a likely record-breaking number of encounters in March of this year ( reportedly over 215,000 ) .\nAnd of this , only roughly half of those were turned away under Title 42 , meaning over 100,000 more releases in that month alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with termination of Title 42 , we could reach 18,000 migrants arriving in a single day\u2014more than double the roughly 7,100 we currently apprehend daily , and 18 times more than when the Obama era DHS Secretary said 1,000 encounters per day was a \u201c crisis.\n\u201d DHS also estimates roughly 25,000 migrants are camped near the border , waiting for Title 42 \u2019 s demise .\nMost of all , however , consider that Mayorkas has used Title 42 as the basis for almost all of those refused entry since he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump administration predecessors .\nThe Trump administration used Title 42 to turn away more than 80 percent of illegal migrants , compared to now when only roughly 50 percent are , due to policies exempting unaccompanied minors and most families .\nSo , with Title 42 terminated , virtually all of these illegal migrants would be released into the United States .\nMeanwhile , it is a

''\nI want to ask our friends on the left a question .\nAnd I hope I can ask it in good faith , because I really do want to know the answer .\nRecently , New York Magazineran an article called , \u201c How Texas Became the Most Virulently Anti-Trans State in America.\n\u201d What do you folks make of that headline ?\nPlease be honest .\nBecause , to me , it looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Magazine is upset that Texas governor Greg Abbott is trying to halt \u201c gender-affirming care \u201d for minors .\nThis includes \u201c reassignment surgeries that can cause sterilization , mastectomies , removals of otherwise healthy body parts , and administration of puberty-blocking drugs or supraphysiologic doses of testosterone or estrogen.\n\u201d And you may be for or against .\nBut from where I \u2019 m standing , he hasn \u2019 t actually changed anything .\nDoctors only began \u201c treating \u201d transgendered children with hormone therapy in 2004 .\nBack then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBefore then , anyone who injected little girls with testosterone would be charged with a felony .\nAnyone who castrated a little boy went to prison .\n\u201c Gender-affirming care \u201d has become more widespread by slipping through a kind of permanent loophole in American law , whereby doctors are allowed to do things normal people are not ( e.g.\n, injecting little girls with testosterone ) .\nAt first , few people took notice of the procedure because it was extremely rare .\nSo was Gender Identity Disorder , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today , as many as one in ten young Americans identify as \u201c gender-diverse.\n\u201d More of them are also seeking \u201c gender-affirming care.\n\u201d Clearly , governments can \u2019 t keep turning a blind eye to these procedures .\nIt has to take some kind of position .\nNow , you may think the State of Texas is going about this the completely wrong way .\nYou may think Gov .\nAbbott should follow the science , believe all trans kids , etc .\nJust for the sake of argument , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut do you really think that makes Texans \u201c virulently anti-trans \u201d ?\nMaybe you think that giving puberty-blockers to children is a no-brainer .\nThus , if you oppose sex changes for minors , there \u2019 s only one possible reason : You feel a visceral hatred for trans people .\nThere can be no alternative .\nIt has to be mindless , deep-seated bigotry .\nYou may say \u201c Yes , that \u2019 s exactly what I think.\n\u201d But I don \u2019 t believe you really mean it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , I \u2019 m not saying you doubt the party line .\nYou \u2019 re a true believer .\nI get that .\nYou are 100 percent convinced that children should be able to access this \u201c gender-affirming care.\n\u201d But do you really think we conservatives are motivated only by hatred ?\nDuring an April 6 testimony , Health and Human Services secretary Xavier Becerra vowed to use taxpayer money to fund sex-reassignment surgery for minors .\nYet even according to pro-trans sources , \u201c only \u201d 8 percent of transgender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real number is probably much higher , especially for minors . )\nThat means at least one in ten children who receive one of Becerra \u2019 s sex-reassignment surgeries will come to regret their decision .\nThat may not bother you .\nI \u2019 m not sure how , yet if you say it doesn \u2019 t , I \u2019 ll believe you .\nBut can you not see how some people\u2014Greg Abbott , for instance\u2014may find those statistics a little disturbing ?\nCan you not see why some people may be reluctant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to every man , woman , and child in America ?\nOr are you going to double down on the \u201c virulently anti-trans \u201d theory ?\nI just don \u2019 t buy it .\nYou can \u2019 t not see where we \u2019 re coming from .\nIt \u2019 s impossible .\nIt \u2019 s not even bad faith .\nIt \u2019 s just nonsense .\nI have to believe that , deep down , you understand our concerns .\nAnd so there must be a part of you that wonders why progressives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissing conservatives as mere transphobes .\nOf course , they might have the very best reasons .\nMaybe it \u2019 s because they \u2019 re deeply concerned for the wellbeing of trans kids .\nBecerra said , \u201c I will do everything I can \u201d to \u201c protect the rights of any American \u201d to receive \u201c gender-affirming care.\n\u201d Maybe that includes defaming and browbeating his critics .\nBut has that tactic ever worked ?\nThink back to all the arguments you \u2019 ve had in your life .\nWhen you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your side , how many ad hominems do you use ?\nClose to zero , I \u2019 ll bet .\nHow about when you \u2019 re on the ropes\u2014when your opponent is clearly in the right , but you just can \u2019 t let go of the bone ?\nProbably quite a lot .\nSo , let me ask you one last question , my left-leaning friend .\nWhy are there so many ad hominems coming from the left in the trans debate ?\nWhy do respectable publications like New York indulge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they trying to hide ?\nLet me give you our theory .\nAfter gay marriage was settled in 2015 , progressives needed a new cause .\nSo , they decided to put all their eggs in the trans basket .\nCome to find , though , that ordinary Americans are repulsed by the idea of letting trans boys change in the girl \u2019 s locker room .\nThey don \u2019 t want to incarcerate trans men in female prisons .\nAnd very few of us would ever support the idea of letting children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut off by surgeons .\nAdults ?\nMaybe .\nBut not children .\nSo , progressives did what we humans always do : They started slinging mud .\nAnyone who questions the latest gender theory must be anti-trans\u2014virulently so .\nAnd where do we get the latest gender orthodoxy ?\nFrom the Journal of the American Medical Association ?\nOh , no , from New York Magazine , of course .\nTo conservatives , it seems pretty clear this isn \u2019 t about children , or healthcare , or science .\nIt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were too quick to embrace the most radical pro-trans line .\nNow , instead of walking it back a little , they \u2019 re doubling down .\nIn a couple of decades , we \u2019 ll hear from thousands upon thousands of men and women who fell victim to this ideology .\n\u201c When I was four , I started wearing my sister \u2019 s dresses .\nMy mother told me I was trans .\nI didn \u2019 t know what \u2018 trans \u2019 was , of course , except that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealous .\nThen came the injections.\n\u201d Children who are on puberty blockers when they reach adolescence are apt to have stunted growth and brittle bones .\nGirls won \u2019 t develop hips or breasts , and will likely be infertile .\nBoys will not be able to build muscle mass or grow facial hair .\nTheir genitals won \u2019 t develop , either ; they \u2019 ll remain small and impotent for the rest of their lives .\nAnd they \u2019 ll be at a much higher risk of suicide .\nNo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that damage .\nYou only get one shot at puberty .\nIf you miss it , that \u2019 s it .\nGovernor Abbott doesn \u2019 t think children should be able to make that call .\nIf they choose to watch SpongeBob SquarePants , they \u2019 re clearly not rational actors .\nThey can \u2019 t be trusted with their own life changing medical decisions .\nWhen they hit maturity , they can do what they like .\nBut before Timmy chooses to be a girl , let him try being a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its ilk , that \u2019 s unconscionable .\nIt \u2019 s a violation of Timmy \u2019 s human rights .\nIt \u2019 s self-evidently evil .\nThere \u2019 s no reason anyone could think that was a good idea\u2014none except a profound , irrational hatred for trans people .\nOf course , that \u2019 s a complete and utter lie .\nYou know it as well as I do .\nI \u2019 m sure the media told you that we conservatives are on the wrong side of history .\nThe future will vindicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it vindicated the civil rights movement .\nWell , that \u2019 s a lie , too .\nMark my words : Someday , and someday soon , we \u2019 ll put \u201c trans kids \u201d in the same category as the castrati of Italy and the bacha bazi of Afghanistan .\nThey \u2019 re all children who have suffered irreparable harm , both physical and psychological , to gratify adults .\nDeep down , I think you know that everything I \u2019 m saying is true .\nWhy not admit your mistake before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it \u2019 s the politicians and journalists who are to blame .\nWhy take the fall for their mistake ?\nWhy make yourself culpable in their wrongdoing ?\nStop letting them gaslight you .\nYou don \u2019 t have to play along

really was .\nI remember , as a child , watching cartoon depictions of Christ \u2019 s Passion ( and one time\u2014early enough for the violence and the Satan Baby to be permanently scarring\u2014Mel Gibson \u2019 s graphic version ) , in which the prisoner offered by Pilate to be freed is presented as a terrifying thug .\nHe is always muscular and bearded , usually shirtless , sometimes tattooed .\nIn Gibson \u2019 s Passion of the Christ , his right eye is dead and glazed over , his front teeth black and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hyperbolic contrast to the stolid Jesus of Nazareth .\nMaybe he was all of these things ; I doubt I would want to run into him in a dark Jerusalem alley .\nBut he was not , as the narrative we teach our children usually suggests , a simple murderer .\nHis crime was political : He had committed murder during an uprising against the Roman occupiers .\nHe was one of the Zealots , a sect whose adherents Josephus says \u201c agree in all other things with the Pharisaic notions ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty , and say that God is to be their only Ruler and Lord.\n\u201d He may even have been a sicarius , a dagger-wielder : a splinter group of anti-occupation terrorists who hid sicae in the folds of their cloaks to assassinate Romans quickly only to fade back into a crowd .\nIt was also theological .\nThe Jews had been promised deliverance .\nWith subjection to the Romans only the latest in a centuries-long string of oppressions and indignities , many began to tire of waiting for God \u2019 s assurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , bar-Abbas ( \u201c son of the father \u201d ) , signifies a choice : between the King whose kingdom is not of this world , and a pretender who promises liberation in the here and now .\nOnly when we understand this does the choice of the Jews make sense .\nIt is no senseless indulgence of some random street criminal , but an option for a temporal champion , an idol , over the true Messiah .\nIn some sources , the man \u2019 s name is recorded as Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then be understood as a warning against the zealots of our own day and age\u2014and it is that .\nBut we must be mindful of letting caution morph into quietism .\nThe reality of the temptation to \u201c immanentize the eschaton \u201d does not give us permission , much less a mandate , to step aside and let history run its course .\nTo illustrate the risk of overcompensation , we might look to the man who offered the choice between Jesus and Barabbas : Pontius Pilate , the governor of the Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political quietists misunderstand the Passion \u2019 s implications .\nOur Lord , they say , was killed by the government ; His persecution , much like that attempted by Herod decades earlier , sits at the beginning of a long tradition of Church-state animosity .\nBut Pilate is no tyrant : He simply washes his hands and steps aside .\nHe does , in fact , exactly what we risk doing when we are overcome by too much fear of Barabbas .\nPilate \u2019 s error is not an abuse of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a political man in the Gospels whose example we should follow , it is the Pharisee Nicodemus .\n( We can do more , in fact , than follow his example ; we can pray for his intercession . )\nHe is a teacher and leader of the Jews\u2014most likely one of the 71 judges of the Sanhedrin .\nHe becomes convinced of the truth of Jesus \u2019 s teachings and his claims to divinity , and so comes by night to hear what the Messiah has to say .\nHe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not turn his back on his worldly duties .\nLater in John \u2019 s Gospel we find Nicodemus still among the Pharisees , speaking on behalf of the accused Messiah .\nWe have our Pilates .\nWe have plenty of Barabbas .\nIt is Nicodemus that the current moment lacks so desperately .\nIt is Nicodemus , some tradition holds , who takes the Lord \u2019 s body down from the cross .\nThe evangelist tells us that he brought one hundred pounds of myrrh and aloes\u2014an amount fit for a king\u2014to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere is a beautiful depth to this fact .\nIt is Nicodemus , the man who stands in the breach for Christ\u2014who refuses either ( like Barabbas ) to buck the constraints of the world in which he lives or ( like Pilate ) to shed its responsibilities\u2014who takes charge of the battered body of the God just crucified .\nAt the center of one of the Incarnation \u2019 s most terrible , consequential , and yet ( as we know ) good moments , we find a man who truly understands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Nicodemus first approaches Christ , \u201c God so loved the world that he gave his only Son , so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life .\nFor God did not send his Son into the

good man .\nHe cared for the poor and the needy and often invited them into his court to be fed and warmed .\nOne day , four blind children came begging alms , and the king \u2019 s minister invited them inside .\nNow this raja owned a donkey , and these beggars , being blind and little experienced in the world , did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donkey was .\nAnd as they waited to be fed in the outer courtyard of the royal palace , they heard the donkey \u2019 s braying , and so they went up to it , to find out what the animal was .\nThe first child felt the creature \u2019 s leg , and declared that it must be an especially large kind of goat .\nThe second blind child felt its stomach , and said that no , indeed , it was a sort of tall pig .\nThe third little beggar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered if it were not rather a kind of furry serpent .\nAnd the fourth sightless child felt its face and ears and remarked that the donkey seemed rather like a mythical creature she had been told of , the one purported to have been the sometime consort of the fairy queen , Titania .\nOf course , as you well know , that is not how the story goes .\nIndeed , in the tale as it is commonly told it is an elephant that some blind men in India feel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEventually they learn that perspective matters , and that knowing something about a thing is not the same as knowing the thing itself\u2014the whole is not always suggested by the part .\nWe sighted people might conclude that some things are more easily seen from a distance .\nThe Ukraine conflict , in which an illiberal multicultural empire has invaded a liberal imperial outpost\u2014a conflict that , despite all the ample ra-ra-ra rally-around-the-flag evidence , the United States is not officially involved in\u2014ought to be a similar learning opportunity for Americans paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the epistemic point .\nIt is basically impossible to know with any certainty what is actually happening on the ground in a war mediated six ways from Sunday by interested parties and digital technology .\nYou are only ever describing part of the war , not the war itself .\nBut perhaps more important than that is the chance to recognize that the political situation we are very close to , here in the United States , obscured by proximity , is perhaps not so different from the politics we observe in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Ukraine is an island of liberal democracy in a backwards sea of autocracies , and now under authoritarian attack .\nLiberal democracy is , you see , what the U.S. is , too .\nNot for us to question this coincidence , or to argue that while America is a liberal democracy , Ukraine actually isn \u2019 t .\nNo .\nI believe women .\nIf a journalist tells me Ukraine is a liberal democracy and liberal democracy is what Ukraine is then it must be so .\nSo , what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a start .\nAs TAC contributing editor Ted Galen Carpenter has detailed , Ukrainian authorities , including President Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelensky , have \u201c harassed political dissidents , adopted censorship measures , and barred foreign journalists whom they regarded as critics of the Ukrainian government and its policies .\nSuch offensive actions were criticized by Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch , the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , and other independent observers.\n\u201d Ukrainian oligarch Igor Kolomoisky owns many of the country \u2019 s important media outlets , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that launched Zelensky and his actor friends onto the national stage first aired .\nHe backed Zelensky \u2019 s candidacy .\nKolomoisky has also backed extremist paramilitary groups , including the Azov battalion .\nAnd what is America like ?\nIt is a liberal democracy , like Ukraine , so we should expect some similarities .\nJeff Bezos , a powerful oligarch accused of monopolistic control of parts of the American economy , owns the Washington Post , one of the most important and influential political media companies in the country .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the Turkish fashion , American political observers call \u201c the Deep State , \u201d with strong ties to the military industrial complex .\nIt is used to harass political dissidents , push censorship measures , and bar independent journalists whom the establishment regard as critics of the American regime and its policies .\nYesterday , a piece by Post tech columnist Taylor Lorenz was published targeting the popular \u201c Libs of TikTok \u201d Twitter account , which seeks to bring attention to progressive extremism and stupidity .\nLike in Ukraine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just the one profiting most from the current regime , America too has dissident oligarchs in addition to those in its establishment .\nWhen the world \u2019 s richest man , Elon Musk , made moves to purchase Twitter\u2014the de facto public square for elite discourse\u2014in the name of free speech , reactions were immediate and hysterical .\nJournalism professor Jeff Jarvis compared the possibility to the imminent collapse of the Weimar Republic , and was not alone in the sentiment .\nFascism ,

the parts of her politics that are decidedly unexceptional .\nAs the United States has over the last century sought to shape the world in its image , especially places like Ukraine , and as the @ @ @

question for the New Right appears to be not whether we should be ruled by billionaire capitalists , but which billionaire capitalists should hold sway .\nElon Musk \u2019 s attempt to purchase Twitter is probably doomed to failure regardless of how much money he is able to raise against his shares in Tesla .\nBut the jubilation with which his attempted takeover has been greeted by conservatives , especially those who consider themselves part of the inchoately defined \u201c postliberal \u201d continuum , is worth considering regardless of whether Musk and his $ 265 billion bring about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the already declining social media platform .\nAsking Musk to make Twitter more hospitable toward conservatives ( by changing its terms of service , say , or simply adjusting the means by which they are enforced ) is precisely the sort of seemingly outmoded tactic that many exponents of a new non-fusionist conservatism otherwise reject out of hand .\nSince at the least the 1970s , conservatives have been demanding a seat at the table , only to discover that most conservatives ultimately conform to the ideological standards imposed by the mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at best , retreat to a kind of \u201c referee mode \u201d whereby they offer ( sometimes useful ) descriptive accounts of the right and its aspirations without staking out any substantive first-order commitments themselves .\nFor these reasons , a plea for representation , one that involves an appeal to old-fashioned liberal attitudes about the marketplace of ideas , will strike many observers of the so-called New Right as an obvious blind alley .\nThen there is the question of Twitter as a technology .\nIt seems difficult to argue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social media and , by extension , the internet , are fundamentally regrettable developments in our public life\u2014enforcers of ill-considered quasi-orthodoxies , abettors of the financialization of the economy , cancers on our collective attention spans , spiritually , morally , and aesthetically , corrosive\u2014all while insisting upon unfettered access to them .\nIf conservatives believe Twitter is as bad as all that , why not devote time and attention to developing new structures for the dissemination of ideas ( or reviving old ones ) ?\nBut there is a much more interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells us something about the postliberal right : its fundamental attitude toward money .\nA certain cognitive dissonance is implicit in the act of decrying \u201c elitism , \u201d however broadly and indeed nebulously defined , while practically begging the world \u2019 s wealthiest man to shore up your influence on a website whose value as a shaper of public opinion appears to be decreasing by any tangible measure .\nConservatives who want Musk to purchase Twitter ( or otherwise involve himself in its operations ) are not interested in altering , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure of American society .\nInstead of committing themselves to a program of broad-based structural reform ( one that might entail , for example , the nationalization of ISP , search , social media , and other basic internet functions as public utilities and thus subject to various First Amendment protections ) , they accept that the money power will continue to hold illimitable dominion .\nAt the most basic speculative level , the question for the New Right is not whether we should be ruled by billionaire capitalists , but which billionaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural priorities will be .\nI say \u201c cultural priorities \u201d deliberately .\nAs far as I am aware , on questions such as the provision of health care , the decline of wages , unionization , and other questions presumably of interest to anti-fusionist conservatives , Musk has been silent , at least when his own business practices have not spoken for themselves .\nWhy , then , is Musk more appealing to the post-fusionist right than his immediate predecessors ?\nAnd what would American conservatism look like if Elon Musk played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Koch Brothers a decade and a half ago ?\nTo take them in reverse order , my guess is that a conservatism in which the father of Grimes \u2019 s children replaced the Kochs or Sheldon Adelson would very much resemble the one that exists at present , albeit with non-libertarian economics once more considered a non-starter and the handful of apparently \u201c live \u201d issues that continue to animate social conservatives more or less abandoned .\n( Among other things , this would mean relinquishing the right \u2019 s opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of Americans with views that could be described as socially conservative and economically moderate to progressive . )\nWhich brings me to my first question\u2014why would such an arrangement with Musk or similar figures be desirable to so-called postliberals ?\nWhile some cynical observers might argue it is because they are insincere in their attempts to jettison conventional GOP wisdom about political economy while adopting a less defensive posture in the culture wars , I propose a more charitable explanation .\nIt is likely , I think , that most postliberal thinkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Caesarism that does not destroy but only changes the terms of society \u2019 s obligations to the money power .\nIt is difficult to argue against such fatalism .\nSpenglerian gloom is not an intellectual position but an all-pervading assumption that does not admit of exceptions , even for Catholics committed to both the letter and the spirit of 1 Timothy 6:10 .\nStill , going forward a certain degree of intellectual ( and I daresay ) rhetorical humility might be in order , lest un-self-critical members of the new right-wing @ @

of this year \u2019 s French presidential election have been rather unsurprising .\nThe incumbent Emmanuel Macron garnered the plurality of votes ( 27.8 percent ) while his now longtime rival Marine Le Pen was second ( 23.2 percent ) .\nComing in a close third was the socialist candidate Jean-Luc Melanchon ( 22 percent ) .\nLike last time , Macron and Le Pen will face one another in a runoff .\nAnd like last time , Macron will probably win despite his mediocre leadership and his country \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been nice to witness an upset by the conservative populist Eric Zemmour , who captured the hopes and dreams of traditional conservatives around the world when he announced his presidential run a few months ago .\nFor once , it looked like France would have its very own Donald Trump , an outsider who could make France great again .\nHe was unapologetically patriotic and recognized the deleterious effects of globalism , mass immigration , and E.U .\nelitism .\nUnfortunately , Zemmour was less a Trump and more Ross Perot , collecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom would have otherwise voted for Le Pen .\nAlthough many American leftist writers agonized over Zemmour \u2019 s apparent right-wing extremism and his impact on the public discourse in France , nothing like this happened .\nThe public conversation in France is still very much the same , with the same types of candidates running for office and the same concerns preoccupying French voters .\nNevertheless , even if the French decided to blow off Zemmour \u2019 s candidacy and learn nothing from it , American conservatives would do well to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation .\nThere were three key factors that led to Zemmour \u2019 s loss , and could also lead to Republicans losing their races in the near future : ( 1 ) Big Tech/big government censorship , ( 2 ) an obsession over the culture to the exclusion of all other issues , and ( 3 ) an uncharismatic , visually unappealing intellectual being the face of the party .\nAs David Harsanyi argues in depth in his book Eurotrash , the French and other Western Europeans do not enjoy the same free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments , in combination with the Big Tech platforms , enforce several hate speech laws , effectively putting certain topics out of bounds of public discourse , most notably immigration .\nThis poses actual legal problems for conservative candidates like Zemmour and Le Pen who point out the obvious challenges associated with a large influx of Muslim immigrants who struggle with assimilation .\nAll their concerns are immediately classified as hate speech and removed from all social media platforms .\nSo while Trump could hold rallies with crowds chanting \u201c Build the Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Le Pen were silenced on multiple fronts .\nMuch like the American media but with more influence and even less accountability , the French media continued to gaslight their audiences , assuring them that Zemmour was a kook , that \u201c diversity is their strength , \u201d and that mass immigration has nothing to do with the country \u2019 s high taxes , massive national debt , the deteriorating school system , or the rise in crime .\nIt also doesn \u2019 t help that Zemmour fixated on the culture while often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy and foreign policy .\nWhile my family members and others appreciated Zemmour \u2019 s moving speech about restoring French greatness , this didn \u2019 t really address the nuts and bolts of policies that could remedy the situation .\nZemmour wanted to restore French industry and innovation , but , aside from driving out immigrants and teaching Latin in public schools , what else would he do ?\nThis question is decisive .\nThe French are an understandably proud people with a cultural legacy that attracts millions of tourists and admirers every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father can attest , they also have a long history of bureaucratization , centralization , and corporatism .\nMuch of their national pride now hinges on how much their government will give them .\nLe Pen understood this and promised not to touch entitlements , thus growing her support .\nZemmour , however , hints at the truly radical notion of national excellence without direct government payouts and makes himself unelectable .\nBesides missing the bigger issues concerning voters , discussing immigration while emphasizing a more cohesive national culture can quickly sound intolerant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zemmour \u2019 s argument against immigration was that French culture and civilization was generally superior to the culture of immigrants coming in .\nMost immigrants ( which includes Zemmour \u2019 s parents , who immigrated from Algeria ) would actually agree with this , which is why they move to France in the first place .\nFor native-born French people who take their cultural blessings for granted , this just sounds racist and xenophobic .\nRather , Zemmour should have followed the example of Le Pen and stressed the economic and social costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care if their culture is undermined and replaced by something that is largely incompatible with their values .\nA great many French citizens do care if their precious welfare is diminished by unproductive moochers coming into the country .\nAnd , if all goes well for Le Pen and both Zemmour and Melanchon \u2019 s voters pick her over Macron , this self-interested argument will be the thing that wins her the presidency .\nFinally , in addition to being censored and focusing too much on culture , Zemmour \u2019 s failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election can also be attributed to his image as a public intellectual\u2014that is , a nerd .\nThere is a reason why men like Steve Bannon , Karl Rove , or pundits like Ben Shapiro and Tucker Carlson don \u2019 t run for office .\nAs bright and attuned as they are to what the public wants , they are not politicians .\nAt the risk of pointing out the obvious , a politician \u2019 s main job is being popular and attracting the support of people from all walks of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMen like Zemmour , who drop literary references and praise conservative writers like \u201c Doooglas Murray , \u201d will fail to win the support of the working class that they ostensibly advocate for .\nBy contrast , jocks like Donald Trump or Ron DeSantis convey an authenticity and strength that makes them more likable to blue collar voters .\nZemmour likely knew this already , which is why he delayed his announcement to run until late November last year .\nIf there \u2019 s any hope for his movement , he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for office .\nThe same goes for the populist conservative movement here in America .\nThere are plenty of great thinkers advocating for a New Right , but they will need some charismatic personalities with a common touch to replace the establishment GOP incumbents and contend with today \u2019 s progressives .\nWhatever the corporate media and today \u2019 s leftist regimes may proclaim , this fight is not over .\nEven if he didn \u2019 t win , Zemmour \u2019 s run illuminated some of the ways for non-elites to combat a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTrue , the change to a more accountable democratic government that serves the people won \u2019 t come from elections alone , but neither will it come from stirring polemics alone .\nOne must lead to the other for

from the introduction to the expulsion of its liberal element .\nMagazine editor and writer Irving Kristol , a Neo-Marxist turned Neo-Conservative , sits at his desk surrounded by books .\nMatthew

Brent Bozell Jr. is likewise undervalued .\nContinetti handles Bozell \u2019 s early arguments with Frank Meyer fairly well but struggles to understand and convey the depths of the Triumph founder \u2019 s Catholic-inflected politics .\nA more thorough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the subject more seriously\u2014seems especially worthwhile given the current ascendance of Bozellite political Catholicism among younger right-wingers who witnessed the unraveling of Frank Meyer \u2019 s successors .\nAnd then there \u2019 s Pat Buchanan .\nIn \u201c Nixon \u2019 s Conservatives \u201d \u2014the book \u2019 s best chapter by far\u2014Buchanan emerges as a key protagonist .\nHe is effectively credited for most of the president \u2019 s political successes .\nHe appears again as a conservative force in the Reagan administration\u2014another of the stronger points in The Right .\nHis famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most compelling distillations of moderate , populist cultural conservatism ever offered by an American public figure , is treated at some length .\nOnly once Continetti reaches the foundation of TAC did I realize I was supposed to think Buchanan was the bad guy .\nSuddenly the genius of the Nixon administration , the prophet of the Culture War , was revealed to be a brutish anti-Semite .\nIn a long essay on the arguments for war with Saddam Hussein , Buchanan neglected to \u201c attack the most famous members of the \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gentiles , \u201d and instead \u201c impugned the Jewish intellectuals who backed the invasion.\n\u201d Continetti claims , \u201c He might as well have been quoting the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\n\u201d This smear is as vicious as it is moronic .\nOf course the war \u2019 s prosecutors\u2014Cheney , Rumsfeld , Rice , etc .\n( \u201c cautious , circumspect , and suspicious of ideology in foreign affairs , \u201d according to Continetti ) \u2014are all deserving of the harshest condemnation .\nBut they are , quite simply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essay .\n\u201c Whose War ?\n\u201d was about the Iraq debacle \u2019 s intellectual boosters : people like Paul Wolfowitz , Richard Perle , and Robert Kagan who ( oddly enough ) appear in The Right as exemplars of neocon thought on foreign policy .\nThere may be a few omissions in the piece , but the plain fact of the matter is that Pat Buchanan \u2019 s catalogue of hawkish intellectuals is practically identical to Matthew Continetti \u2019 s .\nThe careful reader , too , will detect a hint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive treatment of Jude Wanniski , the eccentric apostle of supply-side economics , the rather important name \u201c Farrakhan \u201d ( a personal friend and hero of Wanniski \u2019 s ) does not pop up once .\nYet elsewhere Continetti is more fair\u2014David Frum , for instance , a neoconservative superstar , comes out looking very badly .\nWilliam F. Buckley Jr. , clearly Continetti \u2019 s hero , has his virtues exaggerated but his vices recognized .\nThe folly of the Iraq war is never quite admitted , but it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admits to the populist thread running through the whole tradition .\nA kind of continuity is suggested between the old New Right of Paul Weyrich and co. and the New Right on the rise today .\nYet that strain , opposed as it is to the liberal one , is treated with skepticism .\nDonald Trump is introduced as \u201c a populist like Andrew Jackson , William Jennings Bryan , Huey Long , Father Charles Coughlin , Joseph McCarthy , George Wallace , Ross Perot , Pat Buchanan , and Sarah Palin.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people is a populist like any of the others , suffice to say that the comparisons ( save maybe that to Sarah Palin ) are not meant to be compliments .\nTrump \u2019 s \u201c American Right resembled conservatism before the Cold War.\n\u201d That is , it was skeptical of war , trade , and immigration without limits .\n\u201c Trump was a populist demagogue \u201d who married \u201c the policy views of Calvin Coolidge with the rabble-rousing of McCarthy.\n\u201d Here Continetti \u2019 s vision becomes clear : The tenuous alliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy , rather than conservatism itself , is the subject of The Right .\nThis , and potentially more , is suggested by Harvey Mansfield \u2019 s approvingly quoted belief \u201c that the principal task of conservatism is to save liberalism from the liberals.\n\u201d Nobody who sincerely believed that could claim to be the arbiter of the right \u2019 s true history .\nNecessity forced right-wingers to make a deal with liberals that lasted for generations ; that practical alliance did not magically fuse the content of liberalism with that of conservatism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicted by Brent Bozell and others ) give liberals the upper hand .\nIt is entirely predictable that now , as that alliance starts to fracture , they should recast history to justify continued dominance of a movement that has afforded them so much .\nContinetti \u2019 s own career has furnished , among other things , a house in the upscale D.C. suburb of McLean

\u2019 outrage over conservatives \u2019 recent use of the term \u201c groomers \u201d to refer to those teaching pre-pubescent children about sex in the public schools .\nEver since Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law forbidding age-inappropriate instruction on sexual subjects , leftists , LGBT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in a state of sustained hysteria over this common-sense legislation .\nThe reader should understand : For the bill \u2019 s supporters in the Florida legislature , the problem wasn \u2019 t that teachers were providing kids with basic information about human reproduction .\nIt was that teachers were openly advocating a radical sexual agenda in the classrooms\u2014one that positions LGBT identity as an inherent moral good , encourages masturbation and porn use to maintain health and \u201c wellness , \u201d teaches that biological sex is meaningless , and claims that sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c feelings \u201d and sensibilities .\nThe leftist educators who pushthis content pretend to be giving a honest , politically neutral account of the realities of sexual identity .\nBut countless videos depicting teachers both in and out of the classroom indicate that this is not the case .\nThese adults are painting traditional sexual ethics as a form of intolerance and closed-mindedness , and propagating a radical vision of culture and sexual autonomy under the guise of love , intelligence , inclusion , sophistication , and health .\nEnacting laws that protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethic their children will be taught , what information they will have access to , and when , seems like a no-brainer to most people .\nThus , many were perplexed by the left \u2019 s tantrum at such a moderate policy .\nGiven these radicals \u2019 tenacityin fighting for the \u201c right \u201d to talk to other people \u2019 s young children about sex , many on the right have taken to referring to them as \u201c groomers.\n\u201d A \u201c groomer \u201d is an adult who tries to prime a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always with the understanding that this grooming ( and the sex that often follows ) will be concealed from the child \u2019 s parents and other caregivers .\nIndeed , a number of teachers and schools are on the record explicitly stating they will withhold information that children share with them from parents , and that they encourage children to keep secrets from their parents .\nThat sounds a lot like grooming .\nBut it isn \u2019 t only the left that is scandalized by use of the label \u201c groomers.\n\u201d The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commentariat ( Bill Kristol , David French , etc . )\nare busy chiding people on the right for their grievous hyperbole , which really doesn \u2019 t contribute to civil discourse in any meaningful way , and thus distracts \u201c us \u201d from the \u201c real issues \u201d ( which presumably include tax breaks , pushing a war with Russia , and worrying about \u201c domestic extremists \u201d ) .\nMost of these people dismiss the accuracy of the \u201c groomer \u201d label on definitional grounds : \u201c Grooming \u201d is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they say , and these teachers don \u2019 t have sexual contact with the kids they are grooming teaching .\nLeave aside that this is provably false ; followers of the news see regular stories where teachers have engaged in illegal sexual activities with their students .\nBut even if Bill Kristol was right that there \u2019 s ( usually ) no sexual contact involved , does that necessarily mean no grooming occurred ?\nThe answer is no\u2014and not just according to some puritanical , hyperbolic definition that circulates on the right-wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of speech and harm that would\u2014if consistently and objectively applied\u2014clearly show the accuracy of the right \u2019 s charges of grooming .\nSome examples of Austin \u2019 s theory are in order .\nThe statement \u201c He drives a red car \u201d seems to merely describe realities that exist independent of the statement itself .\nBut consider a statement like \u201c I apologize for damaging your car.\n\u201d This utterance doesn \u2019 t merely describe : It brings a new reality into being by performing an action .\nHow , exactly , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologizing \u201d ?\nBy saying you apologize .\nThis means that , although they exist only in linguistic contexts , apologies and many other types of speech also constitute particular forms of action .\nThus , Austin \u2019 s key insight is that , in some cases , the \u201c saying \u201d of something is simultaneously a \u201c doing \u201d of something .\nWhen people claim that \u201c the words we use really do matter , \u201d they are acknowledging this fact .\nLanguage has creative power , and rhetoric tends to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most basic terms , America \u2019 s free-speech tradition holds that \u201c Sticks and stones will break my bones , but words will never hurt me.\n\u201d This slogan suggests that while some speech may be harsh or emotionally hurtful , these forms of speech do not in themselves constitute material harm .\nCertainly , there are exceptions to this : Libel and defamation cases are good examples , and you can \u2019 t yell \u201c Fire !\n\u201d in a crowded theater if there isn \u2019 t one .\nBut these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishable under law , are especially narrow and context-dependent .\nTaken at face value , the theory of performative speech has minimal political implications .\nBut activists on the left have used the idea of performativity to advance an ideological account of communication that threatens our free-speech doctrine .\nElaborating the theory of performativity , many recentthinkers have suggested that all speech is performative : that every statement is a particular action that materially changes reality .\nThis idea lies at the heart of the left \u2019 s current war on free speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or statements are literally acts of violence .\nThese beliefs , in turn , justify their call for laws to restrict \u201c hate speech.\n\u201d Whether the reader accepts or rejects the theory of performativity is irrelevant .\nIt is enough to recognize that it is routinelyespousedby leftists to support policies that would broadly curtail the protections currently guaranteed by the First Amendment .\nThe performative theory of speech ( and the left \u2019 s interpretation of it ) can answer these questions .\nTo begin with , we must ask two questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the schools ?\nSecond , ( since these statements aren \u2019 t merely verbal descriptions of reality , but forms of action that change it ) , we must ask what these statements are doing .\nIf language has a seemingly mystical power to produce the realities that it names , what realities do these forms of sexual instruction bring into being ?\nFirst , then , the matter of what is being said : In the introduction to this essay , I linked to a number of those statements .\nTeachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender is determined by individual sentiment or desire rather than by biology or anatomy .\nThey claim there should be no limitations on sexual activity so long as all parties consent and the sex is clinically \u201c safe.\n\u201d They assert that porn use and routine masturbation are ways to maintain \u201c health \u201d and \u201c wellness.\n\u201d They argue that parents have no legitimate authority to set limitations for the sexual behavior of their children , and no exclusive right to restrict the sex-related information that their children can access .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , familiar relationships with other adults that should be kept secret from parents .\nThey advocate a form of moralism that says other people are obligated to acknowledge and respect the legitimacy of an individual \u2019 s claims about \u201c who they are , \u201d regardless of whether reality validates those claims .\nThis is what many teachers are saying .\nSo , what are these statements are doing ?\nThe groomers in the schools would argue that these claims are doing many good things .\nThey are incentivizing young people to adopt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society more \u201c inclusive , \u201d \u201c tolerant , \u201d \u201c accepting , \u201d and \u201c fair.\n\u201d They are de-stigmatizing forms of sex and identity that have historically been viewed as illegitimate , shameful , or immoral .\nIn the cases where parents \u2019 values do run counter to the statements made in the classroom , the teacher \u2019 s speech is exposing children to other \u201c diverse \u201d points of view , thereby stimulating critical thinking and showing that there are multiple \u201c valid \u201d perspectives on any issue .\nOf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which to challenge the idea that these actions are praiseworthy or good .\nBut even if we grant that teachers are laudable for seeking greater inclusion , it is also clear that those conversations can do significant damage to students and their families\u2014regardless of whether anyone actually touches them inappropriately .\nWhat harm are these statements doing ?\nBy claiming that sex or gender is determined by \u201c how you feel , \u201d teachers imply that the rest of society will accept this as true .\nCertainly , students who come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they find that many people do not view internal \u201c feelings \u201d as legitimate indicators of identity .\nBy claiming that the only moral questions relevant to sex pertain to matters of consent and clinical safety , teachers deny the reality that sex can permanently change relationships and cause regret , jealousy , or mistrust\u2014even when everyone says \u201c yes \u201d and wears a condom .\nWhen young people enter into sexual relationships with the idea that the only risks are pregnancy and STDs , we expose them to forms of hurt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porn and masturbation , more harm is done .\nThe negative effects of pornography are well-documented , and , absent the availability of a real-life \u201c partner , \u201d teens especially struggle with the temptation to view it .\nBy encouraging these damaging behaviors , the teachers \u2019 instruction can lead the teenagers to become depending on pornography , which often makes real sex ( when they begin having it ) less satisfying .\nWorse , when young people have limited sexual experience outside porn , viewing explicit sexual content can normalize and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aberrant forms of sex depicted in porn , which often involve the same violence , misogyny , and racism that the schools claim to be combating .\nBy claiming that all good parents will be \u201c accepting \u201d and \u201c affirm \u201d their children \u2019 s choices regarding sex and identity , teachers condition students to expect a parental response that they may not receive .\nBy suggesting that students should withhold information from their parents , teachers cultivate mistrust of the adults who should be the most trusted people in students \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and children can share secrets that should not be conveyed to parents , instructors work to dissolve students \u2019 belief in the legitimacy and superiority of their parents \u2019 authority versus that of the other adults in their lives .\nObviously , then , these claims aren \u2019 t mere statements , but are actions that can negatively impact students \u2019 health and happiness , to say nothing of the threat they pose to the stability and function of their families .\nThe teachers \u2019 insistence on their supposed right to share sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material effects on children .\nIt can create confusion about sex , gender , and identity where none existed .\nIt can result in young people making decisions about sex that they will later regret , causing emotional ( and in some cases , physical ) harm that can change the course of their lives and the viability of future romantic relationships .\nThus , it is indubitable that activist teachers are causing real harm\u2014and it \u2019 s clear that this harm could be easily anticipated by an educated adult .\nStill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this instruction , they insist that nothing will deter them from doing so .\nFor all of these reasons , teachers \u2019 speech on these matters must be recognized as a form of violence .\nBut there are different kinds of violence .\nWhat kind is being inflicted by these teachers ?\nGiven that the harm done by this speech relates almost exclusively to sexual activity , identity , and relationships , we can only view it as a kind of sexual violence .\nSo , is the \u201c groomer \u201d label hyperbole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside your family shares a relationship with your child\u2014a relationship that a . )\ninvolves discussion of sexual matters , b . )\nwithholds information related in those discussions from others , and c. ) potentially or actually results in some form of emotional or physical pain related to sex that could be easily anticipated by the adult .\nIs any reasonable person going to say that such a relationship doesn \u2019 t constitute \u201c grooming \u201d on the grounds that the adult never personally had physical , sexual interaction with the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left \u2019 s own definitions of performative speech , teaching radical sexual content to children is a form of sexual violence .\nTherefore , it should be considered \u201c grooming.\n\u201d What do we call a person who engages in \u201c grooming \u201d ?\nA groomer .\nAnd to use another of the left \u2019 s

defender.\n\u201d During the migrant crisis of 2015 , when Merkel opened the doors to more than one million asylum seekers from the Middle East and elsewhere , some likened her to Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her green-energy and climate policies .\n\u201c Mutti \u201d ( benign mother ) Merkel was almost a secular saint .\nLess than five months since she left , all this hyperbole looks absurd .\nIt has become terribly clear that , far from leaving Germany in good shape , her policies have left it divided , burdened , and appallingly vulnerable to external pressures .\nOne prominent German pundit , Jan Fleischhauer of Focus magazine , has described Merkel \u2019 s legacy as \u201c toxic.\n\u201d Merkel \u2019 s supposed strategic thinking\u2014allegedly always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a myth .\nThe most obvious example is her energy policy , which has left Germany dangerously dependent on Russian sources of energy .\nThis is a side effect of the Energiewende ( the green \u201c energy transition \u201d ) she championed for over a decade , during which time she hastily abandoned nuclear power in the wake of the Fukushima accident .\nGermany has since shut down almost all of its nuclear plants , and is now phasing out coal power .\nThis leaves Germany more reliant on volatile renewables like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imports .\nOn her watch , gas imports through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia , initiated by her Social Democrat ( SPD ) predecessor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der , increased greatly .\nShe pushed ahead with plans for Nord Stream 2 in spite of many warnings from Washington and Eastern Europe .\nBy the time Putin \u2019 s troops entered Ukraine , Germany was purchasing about 55 percent of its natural gas and more than one third of its oil from Russia .\nWhen Donald Trump accused Germany at the 2018 U.N. General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Russian energy and warned that Germany was becoming \u201c captive to Russia , \u201d Merkel \u2019 s then-foreign minister Heiko Maas was seen laughing and smirking .\nHe later rejected the claims contemptuously .\n\u201c There is no dependency on Russia , certainly not in energy matters , \u201d he sneered .\nBut now , Merkel \u2019 s successor , chancellor Olaf Scholz and his Green minister of economy and climate , are desperately trying to secure alternative supplies for natural gas .\nThey have signed hugely expensive LNG contracts with Qatar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitutes will not be available in sufficient quantities for two or three years .\nBerlin , at least for now , is hostage to Moscow \u2019 s gas .\nIt turns out Trump was also right about another crucial question : For years , he blasted Berlin \u2019 s abysmal financial contributions to NATO .\nSince the 1990s , Germany \u2019 s armed forces , the Bundeswehr , have been badly managed and significantly underfunded , receiving about one third less than the NATO-agreed target of 2 percent of GDP for military expenditures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with deficient military hardware , utterly unfit for defensive purposes .\nMerkel and her coalition governments\u2014four years with the liberal party Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) , and 12 years with the SPD\u2014never showed much interest in improving defensive capabilities .\nOn the morning of Russia \u2019 s invasion on February 24 , Lt. Gen. Alfons Mais , the army \u2019 s most senior officer , lamented that years of underinvestment had left his military \u201c more or less naked \u201d .\nFor decades , liberal and Green opinion-makers believed that militaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal \u201c end of history \u201d resonated with these Angst-ridden elites , who also hoped for an end to German ( that is , their own ) history .\nGermany , once considered a militaristic Prussian bully , had turned into a liberal , pacifist , \u201c woke \u201d society incapable of asserting or even recognizing its own interests .\nWhen Olaf Scholz \u2019 s new \u201c traffic light \u201d \u2014red-green-yellow ( SPD-Green-Free Democrat ) \u2014coalition assumed power in December 2021 , they did not intend to emphasize security policy .\nAfter all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister , Scholz had been co-responsible for underfunding of the armed forces for years .\nThe new government \u2019 s focus was on \u201c social justice , \u201d with higher minimum wages and massive spending to fight climate change .\nThe Greens had also pushed for their \u201c woke \u201d progressive agenda with a new transgender law , adoption rights for homosexual couples , and even the idea of civil unions for up to four partners .\nAnnalena Baerbock , the new foreign minister , advocated a \u201c feminist foreign policy \u201d \u2014woke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters abroad and aid instead of military spending .\nThe new defense minister , Christine Lambrecht , is woefully inexperienced in military and security affairs .\nBut three days after Russia \u2019 s invasion , Scholz gave a surprising speech in the Bundestag .\nThe invasion , he declared , marked \u201c a turning point ( Zeitenwende ) in the history of our continent.\n\u201d Germany \u201c must invest much more in the security of our country , \u201d and needed \u201c planes that fly , ships that sail , and soldiers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scholz \u2019 s announcement of 100 billion euros in extra spending for the army came as a shock to many in his own party , the SPD , and the Greens .\nNow , some Green politicians like Anton Hofreiter are suddenly among those making the loudest calls for the delivery of heavy arms to Ukraine .\nBut then the Green Party has always been a strange ideological mix of na\u00efve pacifism and \u201c human rights \u201d interventionism .\nAfter all , it was a red-green government with Green foreign minister Joschka Fischer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albright fan , who sent Germany \u2019 s armed forces into NATO \u2019 s battle against Serbia in 1999\u2014the first time German soldiers had fought in a war since 1945 .\nThe coalition is arguing internally about military support for Ukraine , with Chancellor Scholz less committed to the cause than some others .\nAt the same time , the likes of former senior general Harald Kujat and Merkel \u2019 s former security advisor Erich Vad have urged caution to avoid Germany \u2019 s getting drawn into a full-blown NATO war with Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcements of 100 billion euro for the army were overblown : The small print reveals that the supposed extra spending will not actually increase defense expenditures above the 2 percent target .\nNevertheless , It marks a deviation from the country \u2019 s previous neglect of the army .\nA U-turn in energy policy will be much harder to achieve .\nMerkel \u2019 s Energiewende legacy is deeply ingrained in the thinking of the SPD and especially the Green Party .\nTo many , it is not a policy but a dogma .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ were very proud of the simultaneous abandonment of nuclear and coal , and thought the world would follow their example .\nHowever , no other major industrial country has done so , electricity prices in Germany are the highest among developed nations and the Wall Street Journal has called Energiewende \u201c the world \u2019 s dumbest energy policy \u201d .\nWarren Buffet once joked : \u201c It \u2019 s only when the tide goes out that you learn who \u2019 s been swimming naked.\n\u201d Russia \u2019 s invasion is the turn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she is naked .\nJust before Easter , Germany \u2019 s leading economic research institutes warned that any sudden shut-off of Russian energy would trigger a deep recession and endanger almost half a million jobs in the chemical industries and manufacturing .\nYet even now , the government is refusing to reconsider the future of nuclear energy .\nThey are stubbornly sticking to their plans to turn off the last three German nuclear plants by the end of 2022 .\nMeanwhile , in France , President Macron has announced big plans for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson , and the Belgium governing coalition ( including its Green Party ) has agreed to let their nuclear plants run for ten more years .\nGermany \u2019 s three-party ruling coalition is a heterogeneous mix of parties and ideologies .\nThe Social Democrats call for more welfare spending , the liberal Free Democrats ( FDP ) \u2014representing the \u201c Mittelstand \u201d ( small and medium entrepreneurs ) \u2014 oppose higher taxes , and the Greens\u2014representing urban academic post-materialistic and feminist voters\u2014are keen to \u201c save the planet \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy and society .\nThe coalition agreement is titled \u201c Let \u2019 s Dare More Progress , \u201d which could be translated as \u201c Let \u2019 s Dare More Left-Wing Ideology and State Planning.\n\u201d Many Greens fret obsessively over politically correct gender-neutral language , pronouns , eliminating discrimination , and comforting minorities .\nBut suddenly , all their precious \u201c micro-aggressions \u201d have been rendered insignificant by the brutal macro-aggressions in Ukraine .\nWelcome back to Realpolitik !\nGermany is likely to see a realignment of its party politics\u2014a shift back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite significant for the Christian Democrats ( CDU ) .\nDuring the 20 years Merkel was party leader , the once-conservative party shifted to the center and even the center-left , eliminating its right wing almost completely .\nBefore her accession to the chancellery in 2005 , some political observers speculated that Merkel could become a new Margaret Thatcher .\nNothing could have been more wrong .\nWhile Thatcher was famously \u201c not for turning , \u201d Merkel perfected the art of the shameless U-turn in response to shifts in the Zeitgeist .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly adjusting her color to any backdrop .\nApart from her sudden turn against nuclear power , she also reversed the CDU \u2019 s former support for national military service .\nDuring the debt crisis of 2010 and the following years , she agreed to ever-bigger credit-support packages , meaning effectively that European debt became mutualized and the \u201c no bail-out \u201d clause in the Maastricht treaty became meaningless .\nHowever , the financial support came with strict \u201c austerity \u201d conditions , which caused a lot of resentment against Germany in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But her most infamous U-turn occurred during the migrant crisis of 2015 , when she decided to throw open the border for an uncontrolled influx of hundreds of thousands .\nMerkel \u2019 s Willkommenspolitik ( \u201c welcome policy \u201d ) \u2014enacted along with generous welfare benefits for new arrivals\u2014acted as strong pull factors .\nIn the end , more than one and a half million migrants arrived in Germany .\n\u201c We can do this !\n\u201d she exclaimed at the time .\nIn truth , we could not , and should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked well .\nEven now , almost seven years after they came , around two thirds of Syrians live largely on public benefits and have not found employment .\nThe schmaltzy multiculturalism that left-wingers love to celebrate has too often meant merely added tension and crime , most notably street violence , like the notorious New Year \u2019 s Eve of 2016 when hundreds of German women celebrating the new year in Cologne were molested by recently arrived migrants .\nMerkel \u2019 s open-border policies were firmly opposed by eastern European states like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass migration of mostly young men from mostly Muslim backgrounds .\nThis led to a schism between western and eastern E.U .\nmembers\u2014an ironic outcome to occur under the watch of a politician sometimes called the \u201c Queen of Europe.\n\u201d Merkel has alienated conservatives at home and public opinion in all the eastern European countries by promoting European federalism\u2014a fixation resented by countries that had cast off the yoke of Soviet dominance in 1990 and did not want to surrender their sovereignty all over again to a new super-state , this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irony in Merkel \u2019 s legacy : As leader of the opposition against Schr\u00f6der \u2019 s government , Merkel had castigated the government \u2019 s immigration policy and claimed \u201c multi-culturalism has totally failed \u201d .\nAs chancellor , she became the mother of a new multicultural Germany beset by the social problems and high welfare costs that are associated with open-border regimes .\nAs a consequence of her immigration policy , Germany \u2019 s traditional political landscape was shattered .\nThe CDU \u2019 s constant leftward drift opened space for a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AfD ) , to fill the vacuum .\nThe allegedly anti-populist Merkel effectively served as midwife to the AfD , which has now consolidated national electoral support of about 10 percent .\nIn the 2017 general elections , the Christian Democrats scored less than 33 percent of the vote\u2014their worst result since 1949 .\nAt the end of Merkel \u2019 s 16 years , an exhausted and disoriented CDU , led by the lackluster Armin Laschet , did even worse , coming second to the SPD with just 24 percent of votes .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reinvent itself .\n\u201c Mutti \u201d Merkel didn \u2019 t seem to be bothered .\nAll things considered , the four-term chancellor was less a provident \u201c Mutti \u201d than an opportunistic politician who left a dangerous legacy with which Germany and Europe will have to grapple for a long time .\nPhilip Plickert is a German economist and journalist with the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine

Lefevre/Getty Images ) Voters headed to the polls over the weekend for the second round of the French presidential election .\nThe incumbent , Emmanuel Macron , won with a comfortable 58-42 margin .\nHis nationalist opponent , Marine Le Pen , struck out again , having failed to best Macron in 2017 .\nAdd the 2002 ballot-box thumping of her father , Jean-Marie , and that means someone named Le Pen has lost three of five presidential elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYou can almost hear the sighs of relief rising from the swampiest precincts of D.C. and Brussels .\nFor weeks , the prestige press sounded the alarms about the threat to democracy ( read : liberalism ) posed by a Le Pen takeover of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e .\nThe editors of Financial Times were almost out of nasty adjectives to append next to her name .\nA cartoon in the paper showed Le Pen \u201c closing \u201d France \u2019 s door , cutting off sunshine ( the only thing the outside world offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s major rightist rival , \u00c9ric Zemmour , blames her for fumbling a winnable contest .\nFact is , a majority of voters picked a dissident candidate of some sort or other in the first round , whether Le Pen , Zemmour , or the left-populist Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon .\nBy \u201c dissident , \u201d I mean opposed to the mix of green-ism , cultural progressivism , and economic neoliberalism that forms the ruling class \u2019 s ideology .\nYet precisely that mix triumphed again in the second round .\nHow bad is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France ?\nPretty bad , I suppose .\nGiven the imperial nature of the French presidency , Macron will get five more years to do a lot of things many in the Le Pen-Zemmour-M\u00e9lenchon majority won \u2019 t appreciate\u2014above all , pressing ahead with ever-greater integration in the European Union and the erosion of French sovereignty over France \u2019 s economy , borders , law , and culture .\nIt is worth considering what lessons the latest French result holds for populists elsewhere , especially the United States .\nIn doing so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since no two countries are exactly alike , and some conditions are unique to France .\nNevertheless , a few broad conclusions may be drawn : 1 .\nLiberalism is resilient , its agents devious .\nI say this as much for my own benefit as for anyone else \u2019 s .\nIn 2017-18 , when I made my Cort\u00e9sian break with liberalism , it was in the aftermath of Donald Trump \u2019 s and Brexit \u2019 s victory , when the populist movement appeared invulnerable .\nThe more the too-online libs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength .\nAll along , however , the establishment was marshaling all its powers to ensure no deviation from the neoliberal agenda would take hold .\nI witnessed this firsthand in my own small world of conservative intellectuals , and writ large in the underhanded efforts to undo the outcome of the 2016 election and the Brexit vote .\nIn France and Europe , the establishment \u2019 s discipline in containing populism is so overt , it is almost taken for granted .\nIt was the French who invented the cordon sanitaire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I interviewed Marine Le Pen for the Wall Street Journal , she told me how , before publishing any story , French reporters and editors always ask themselves , \u201c Will this story help the National Front ?\n\u201d ( If the answer was yes , the story got buried or played down . )\nThis time around , the European Union conveniently announced an investigation of Le Pen for allegedly misusing E.U .\nfunds days ahead of the vote .\nThe lesson , then , is that populists need to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , and then in governing .\nBecause when it comes to this kind of anti-systemic politics , we aren \u2019 t dealing with normal partisan give and take\u2014but almost a kind of cold domestic warfare .\n2 .\nPersonal charisma is indispensable .\nSpeaking of that Journal interview , I have to report that while Le Pen has a commanding presence , she ultimately lacks that intangible it factor on which hangs the fate of most politicians .\nShe isn \u2019 t a great debater and sometimes gets tripped up by hostile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her charisma issues would remain insurmountable even if she tried to be charming ; a certain type of French Catholic voter will never vote for someone with that last name , which evokes her father \u2019 s odious reputation .\nBut life , including political life , isn \u2019 t fair , and therein lies the lesson : Some of America \u2019 s current crop of populists and would-be populists also lack that it factor and can best serve the movement from within the halls of the Senate .\nOthers have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump and Ron DeSantis .\n3 .\nClass matters , and so does culture .\nAs Nathan Pinkoski noted in an intelligent Compact column after the first round , Zemmour \u2019 s 2022 campaign faded because he paid too little attention to bread-and-butter , working-class issues .\nWith Zemmour , it was all about restoring lost French cultural greatness threatened by uncontrolled immigration .\nLe Pen , however , went almost too far in the other direction in her bid , toning down issues of social cohesion in favor of the ( very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populist campaign must address both : to target the cultural insanities of the liberal elite , without losing sight of the economic domination that goes hand-in-hand with cultural progressivism .\nSo how bad is Le Pen \u2019 s loss for the global populist movement ?\nThe short answer is : Meh .\nA Le Pen win would have been a really nice surprise and a powerful blow to the liberal establishment .\nBut keep in mind that Le Pen managed to squeeze Macron \u2019 s margin by 8 percentage points , compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three out of ten French voters made what was once considered an unthinkable choice .\nThis time , four out of ten did that .\nGrowth matters .", "author": "Sohrab Ahmari", "url":

.\n( Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images ) Efforts by Disney executives to re-brand a company known for family entertainment into a political advocate for sex education in elementary schools and producer of sexualized content for children are taking the company into turbulent waters that may now go beyond irate parents to include shareholder actions , employee lawsuits , and civil rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEO Bob Chapek steered the entertainment company into the political arena , proclaiming that a Florida law , which bans sex-ed in kindergarten through third grade and requires schools to notify parents about sexual issues related to their children , is \u201c yet another challenge to basic human rights.\n\u201d Disney will henceforth work to \u201c combat similar legislation in other states , \u201d Chapek stated .\nSimultaneous with this declaration , a Disney executive producer revealed her \u201c not-at-all-secret gay agenda \u201d of \u201c adding

in Florida \u2019 s law by a margin of two-to-one .\nIn the wake of pushback from parents and with few other companies stepping up to join Disney \u2019 s campaign , its executives have since gone quiet , perhaps hoping this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shareholders , employees , and state officials are not letting it go so easily .\nIn retaliation for Disney \u2019 s campaign against its laws , the Sunshine State revoked the special self-governing status that Disney World has enjoyed in Orlando for more than 50 years .\nAnd more storm clouds appear to be brewing on Disney \u2019 s horizon .\nIn an April 5 letter on behalf of shareholders to Disney \u2019 s board of directors , Reed Rubinstein , former deputy attorney general in the Trump Administration , demanded a corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corporate assets , \u201d including material harm to Disney \u2019 s brand and reputation , as well as Disney \u2019 s violation of employees \u2019 civil rights by fostering a discriminatory and

while simultaneously opposing parental notification , \u201d and how executives came to the conclusion \u201c that \u2018 adding queerness \u2019 to children \u2019 s programming will enhance the

and \u201c a hostile work environment to silence them and/or drive them out of the Company \u201d violates the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Florida Civil Rights Act , which prohibit religious

of their company , legal action could come in the form of a shareholder derivative lawsuit , by which shareholders sue corporate directors and officers who have neglected their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way that harms the company .\nFor employees who face discrimination , it is increasingly taking the form of civil rights suits .\n\u201c Bob Chapek is in a heck of a lot of trouble , \u201d said Scott

like a cautionary tale for other activist companies .\nIn the brave new world of ESG and \u201c stakeholder capitalism , \u201d in which corporations prioritize social-justice and environmental goals , dissenting shareholders , employees , and customers are starting to push back .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shareholder coalition led by former McDonalds CEO Ed Rensi , demanded a civil rights audit at Bank of America , following reports that the bank was making staff undergo a divisive race-based training program .\nThe coalition , which includes the Free Enterprise Project , 2nd Vote , and the Job

he started his takeover effort on April 1 .\nArm-twisting from shareholders succeeded yesterday in getting Twitter \u2019 s board to accept Musk \u2019 s bid .\nThe ongoing fight for shareholder rights promises to be an uphill battle , however .\nExecutives and board members are usually shielded from liability by the \u201c business judgement rule , \u201d explained Richard Morrison , a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute .\n\u201c As long as there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on , judges are generally loath to second-guess management decisions by CEOs \u201d if they appear to be made in good faith .\nSelf-dealing occurs when corporate officers use company assets for their own personal gain , and has generally applied when managers enrich themselves financially .\nBut the extent of current political activism by CEOs is unprecedented and has raised the question among some legal analysts as to whether using the company to promote one \u2019 s personal beliefs could be considered self-dealing as well .\nIf self-dealing occurs , corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses .\nIn addition to shareholder actions , employees and even customers are now bringing lawsuits .\nIn October , a federal jury awarded $ 10 million to Novant Health employee David Duvall , a white male , in support of his claim that he had been fired because of the company \u2019 s racial and gender policies .\nAnd last week , Shawnee State University agreed to pay $ 400,000 plus attorney fees to Nick Meriwether , a professor at the school , to compensate him for violating his freedom-of-speech rights in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved pronouns .\n\u201c I think we \u2019 ll see more of this litigation coming , \u201d said Jeremy Tedesco , a senior council for Alliance Defending Freedom , a legal organization that advocates for religious liberty and freedom of speech .\nCorporations are \u201c getting more and more aggressive and activist , \u201d he said .\n\u201c They are going to cross those lines and employees are going to have opportunities to push back.\n\u201d A case in point is United Airlines , which implemented racial and gender quotas for pilots last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced

speaks on a 1967 panel on `` The New Left and the American Consensus . ''\n( Denver Post via Getty Images ) There is a fundamental and fundamentally appealing insight at the heart of left-liberalism , as distinguished from classical liberalism or libertarianism , namely , that human societies should be caring and nurturing , integrating more and more of us into the fold , extending a helping hand to those who are struggling , distributing social goods widely rather than narrowly , calibrating their structures to the interests of the many rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this preference , is one that those who occupy the opposite end of the political spectrum from left-liberals generally share .\nI am speaking here , again , not of libertarian \u201c conservatives \u201d of the \u201c greed is good \u201d Randian sort , but rather , Burkean traditionalists or common-good conservatives , people who actually care about their communities and see those around them as something more than means to each individual \u2019 s personal ends .\nAlthough these divergent constituencies agree on the general parameters of what a good society is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreeing profoundly on the details .\nThose disagreements , I contend , are more often than not consequences of the fact that there lies at the very heart of left-liberalism a devastating internal tension or contradiction : By seeking to deploy the power of centralized authority to bring a welfare state into being and to give legal force to the sundry policy preferences crowded under the social justice umbrella , left-liberals necessarily undermine the very kinds of organic communal bonds of trust and affection that are indispensable to bringing their own vision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his classic 1966 work , The Triumph of the Therapeutic , the American sociologist Philip Rieff distinguished between \u201c positive communities , \u201d which aspire toward collective salvation or , more modestly , the attainment of \u201c the good life , \u201d and negative communities , in which the individual merely requires the larger community to fulfill his own needs and ensure his survival .\nRieff \u2019 s contemporary , the great theorist of community and fellow sociologist Robert Nisbet , made a similar distinction between a functional community and a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individuals who are insecure , basically lonely , and ground down\u2026into mere particles of social dust.\n\u201d Traditional societies , Rieff argued , cured the sundry discontents and maladies that might come to befall individuals by integrating or re-integrating the individual into the collective through the enactment of various socially sanctioned practices and rituals .\nFor the traditional approach to work , however , there must exist a broadly compelling set of communal norms and values .\nA culture imposes a set of demands upon individuals , demands that inherently require suppression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inevitably , this entails sexual normalization , that is , a conforming of libidinal desires to prevailing norms for the sake of maintaining communal harmony .\nAnd , just as inevitably , it entails the sacrifice of certain facets of individual identity that are very familiar to us today\u2014race and ethnicity and nonconformist religious and political beliefs\u2014for the sake of the health of the larger collective .\nWhen everything is working as it should , these exercises in self-effacement are not subjectively experienced as great burdens by individual citizens .\nRather , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture builds in for this very purpose .\nIndividuals , thus , see the successful pursuit of self-mastery as a moral triumph , the attainment of a character ideal .\n\u201c A culture , \u201d Rieff concludes , \u201c survives principally\u2026by the power of its institutions to bind and loose men in the conduct of their affairs with reasons which sink so deep into the self that they become commonly and implicitly understood.\n\u201d It is the job of cultural elites to transmit their culture \u2019 s system of moral demands by \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior.\n\u201d Steered by such elites , \u201c books and parading , prayers and the sciences , music and piety toward parents \u2026 are a few of the many instruments \u201d that serve to \u201c unite men and permit them the fundamental pleasure of agreement.\n\u201d When it is molded in this manner , the individual \u201c self \u201d is not sacrificed at all ; it is , rather , created by the community , \u201c direct [ ed ] \u2026outward , toward those communal purposes in which alone [ it ] can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elites lose faith in their own culture \u2019 s system of values , the cultural fabric may begin to fray , and a juncture may arrive when a culture \u2019 s releases become more compelling than its moral demands : In more recent decades , self-expression has only become a still-more-inviolable sphere .\nIf the \u2019 60s was all about ditching the well-arranged bouquet and letting the self flower free of society \u2019 s moral demands , and the \u2019 80s was all about accumulating more for yours truly , then the \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the once-governing order of things : No longer did the community have the right to demand anything of us ; it is now we , a generation of coddled children unable to cope with adversity , who make demands of the community .\nRather than our surrendering our particularity , allowing ourselves to be absorbed into the general stream of our society \u2019 s culture and to be reshaped in accordance with the communal conception of \u201c the Good , \u201d we began to demand that culture , in the widespread contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and \u201c affirm us \u201d individually and exactly as we were .\nIn lieu of an older ethos in which the self was more or less harmoniously absorbed into the identity of the larger group , the self became the locus for the assumption , accumulation , and expression of multifarious group identities , each of which represented another potential arrow in our quiver , another set of demands we could make upon the commonwealth .\nThe critical race theorist Kimberl\u00e9 Williams-Crenshaw \u2019 s concept of \u201c intersectionality \u201d captures this dynamic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which various identities collide .\nThe more spectacular the resulting wreckage , the greater the individual \u2019 s neediness and concomitant status in our new social hierarchy .\nThus , instead of leading the way in modeling a noble ethic of self-control and self-sacrifice for the sake of something bigger and better than the satisfaction of our individual desires , our elites and intellectuals led the slide into a full-on culture of narcissism , as Christopher Lasch put it .\nRieff understood the significance of this development as foreclosing the very possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large numbers of the cultivated and intelligent have identified themselves deliberately with those who are supposed to have no love for instinctual self-renunciation\u2026suggests to me the most elaborate act of suicide that Western intellectuals have ever staged.\n\u201d Here was the giving way of positive community to negative community , community relegated to a mere pool of material and moral resources that the individual could draw upon to enhance and enrich the self , even as our most accustomed expression became a sidelong squint of envy and suspicion : \u201c This culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feels trapped in something like a zoo of separate cages .\nModern men are like Rilke \u2019 s panther , forever looking out from one cage into another.\n\u201d Once the organic bond of communal fellow feeling had been strained to the breaking point and beyond by individualism run riot , any attempt to level out disparities or forge a more generous , compassionate and inclusive society would look increasingly zero-sum , a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul .\nNeedless to say , Peter would be unlikely to give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe state would be required to step in to force his hand , as the economist Friedrich Hayek observed : \u201c To undertake the direction of the economic life of people with widely divergent ideals and values is to assume responsibilities which commit one to the use of force.\n\u201d As Hayek understood , the resort to state coercion , in turn , would lead to a further fraying of social bonds : \u201c While people will submit to suffering which may hit anyone , they will not so easily submit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision of authority\u2026 .\nDissatisfaction of everybody with his lot will inevitably grow with the consciousness that it is the result of deliberate human decision.\n\u201d The more we exercise state power to remake society in the image of some contestable conception of \u201c social justice , \u201d which Hayek calls \u201c a mirage , being both vague and premised on a consensus of value that is impossible \u201d in modern-day liberal states , the more we undermine the traditional economic and social structures of which are forged functional communities in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of common concern .\nThe irony of our story here in the West reaches a still higher fever pitch when we bring contemporary identity politics into the picture .\nWith identity politics , a fundamentally narcissistic and militant conception of the self marches out onto the battlefield under crisscrossing , and sometimes dueling , banners of \u201c oppression \u201d and begins tossing out cluster bombs in purported furtherance of inclusion , solidarity and compassion .\nThe all-guns-glazing barrage against traditional society and its moral , religious and sexual norms and orthodoxies and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as standing in the way of \u201c progress \u201d reify new identities on all sides , drive further social fissures and leave a culture fragmented and individuals alienated from one another and from any sense of the whole .\nThe practice of identity politics , thus , gives rise to a vicious cycle .\nAn identity-based campaign devoted to the interests of individuals sharing characteristic X leads to a similar identity-based awakening on the part of all individuals to whom characteristic X is in any way salient .\nThis includes those , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro-X or generally anti-X mindset , but it also includes those who , whether possessing or not possessing X themselves , might have never given much thought to X before .\nThey are mobilized from merely possessing X to becoming full-fledged Xers or from merely not-X to anti-X .\nStill others may see in the practice of the Xers an opportunity to mount their own parallel campaign devoted to the cause of Y .\nAnd so it goes .\nIdentities metastasize , people polarize and society devolves to a rabble of individuals grouped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own interest masked by fine-sounding labels like \u201c social justice.\n\u201d Far from the more generous , compassionate , and inclusive community that the proponents of identity politics may have envisioned , the end-result of this process is a total breakdown in the stabilizing social structures that make community as such possible .\n\u201c Compassionate communities , as distinct from welfare states , exist only where there is a rich symbolic life , shared , and demanding of the self a hard line limiting the range of desires , \u201d Rieff writes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which many left-liberals remain blind .\nLike left-liberals , common-good conservatives want to live in a nation in which the poor , the sick , the disabled , and most of those who find themselves afflicted with misfortune are treated humanely , a nation in which opportunities are distributed far and wide and not reserved for big corporations , the rich , the powerful , or those of any particular race or ethnicity , a nation that judges people based on their character , not their unchosen characteristics , a nation in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which our human environment , our architecture and our arts , are beautiful and vibrant .\nBut what common-good conservatives understand , and what many left-liberals fail to appreciate , is that in order to realize this shared vision of the good society , we must also nurture interpersonal trust , maintain law and order in our cities and towns , be unafraid to condemn conduct that we view as morally or sexually depraved , expect the observance of basic interpersonal courtesy in accordance with our governing norms and reasonable modesty in dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be all right with the understanding that though we give people the latitude to make free choices , we , like all nations , have our default settings , which require their due respect .\nThis means that both those who live here and legal immigrants who come to these shores obey our laws , assimilate into our culture , and learn our language , our customs and traditions , and our history .\nIt means that though there is no official religion of the American State , there remains a principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our culture and institutions are unapologetic reflections of that fact .\nIt means that though we are kind and generous enough to tolerate some alternative lifestyles discreetly conducted in our midst , this domain too has its traditional defaults and its outer limits .\nAnd it means that though we welcome open public debate and historical inquiry , we will not give a free pass to intellectual vandals who want to coopt our schools and other institutions to inculcate hatred of America , sexualize or radicalize our children , and lead them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Common-good conservatives understand that if we abide by these general norms , we will nurture a society to which compassion comes naturally , as a direct consequence of living in a truly shared polity .\nAlthough there will always be those few at the outermost margins who will undoubtedly feel unduly restricted in such a society and who may feel more comfortable elsewhere , most of us , even most who are outliers in one or more respects , will find that a secure nation confident in its national identity can tolerate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no need to engineer harsh crackdowns against small slights and harmless deviations from settled norms .\nIt is precisely that sense of a settled , secure national identity that left-liberals have undermined by waging a series of ill-conceived crusades on our traditions in the name of individual self-determination .\nHaving unmoored us from our cultural foundations , made us unable to expect decency and civility from one another , and destroyed our basic sense of mutual trust , left-liberals are left with no choice but to resort to state power and heavy-handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major institutions to force us to abide by new , alien customs , laws , and codes of behavior .\nAll this is in a misdirected effort to compel the compassion that would emerge organically where all is working as it should .\nThis is the difference between Rieff \u2019 s \u201c compassionate community \u201d and the contemporary left-liberal \u201c welfare state , \u201d one in which , instead of a helping hand readily extended to neighbors in need , benefits are begrudgingly conferred even as we seethe at one another from behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live .\nOur society is rapidly reaching a breaking point .\nWe have a simple choice : we can stand by , let the final calamity unfold and see what , if anything , is left behind in the wreckage .\nOr else we can wake up , grasping the urgency of the moment , realizing that there yet remains so much worth salvaging , and start working tirelessly , day and night , for the common good , to remake this fraying nation into a small-town , big-tent America where neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land can unlock their gates , leave their bunkers , and step out onto safe city streets and winding country lanes to greet each other with

connection\u2014completely spuriously\u2014between anti-Asian hate crimes and the China Initiative .\n\u201c If the Biden administration is truly serious about stopping hate crimes against Asian Americans\u2014and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and researchers are clearly hateful acts\u2014a good place to start would be ending DOJ \u2019 s racist \u2018 China Initiative , \u2019 \u201d he wrote in Defending

Olsen in his speech announcing an end to the program .\n\u201c But by grouping cases under the China Initiative rubric , we helped give rise to a harmful perception that the department applies @ @ @ @

Mike McCaul , ranking member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fox News Sunday .\n\u201c You concede that China remains the top threat and is deserving of focus , \u201d wrote Sen. Chuck Grassley in a letter to Olsen .\n\u201c You concede that all criticisms of the China Initiative , including accusations of racism , are ill-founded .\nYou state that at no time was a Chinese espionage case ever inappropriately undertaken , and that all cases done under the China Initiative reflect the seriousness of the threat from the Chinese state rather than the ancestry of any defendant charged .\nNotwithstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancelled in order to accommodate unfounded perceptions.\n\u201d \u201c Attorney General Merrick Garland and senior leaders at the DOJ appear to have been unable to look past the synchronized criticism of activists and journalists to evaluate the China Initiative based on its merits , \u201d wrote former NSA general counsel Michael Ellis , in a white paper for the Heritage Foundation .\n\u201c The continued outsized national security threat from China , the initiative \u2019 s significant achievements to date , and the need for a long-term reorientation of U.S. national security policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all justify maintaining the initiative\u2014if not invigorating it.\n\u201d What proved so controversial was the Justice Department enforcing the principle that academics shouldn \u2019 t lie about their work for Chinese universities while working on publicly funded research here .\nEven more than alleged racial profiling , the pushback on the China Initiative seemed to center around the idea that we simply don \u2019 t treat academics like that .\nOlsen , in his speech ending the China initiative , suggested that the DOJ would consider \u201c whether civil or administrative remedies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research integrity cases .\nCritics of the China Initiative have a point that the vast majority of these cases did not involve espionage , strictly speaking .\n\u201c Neither Lieber nor other professors being prosecuted pursuant to the initiative were accused of stealing any intellectual property or improperly sharing anything with anyone in China , \u201d wrote Arent Fox attorney Peter Zeidenberg , who has represented Chinese-Americans in some of these cases .\nIt \u2019 s true , but trivial .\nEspionage cases are notoriously hard to prosecute because of the need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasn \u2019 t charged with espionage either , just lying about it .\nThat doesn \u2019 t mean he wasn \u2019 t a spy .\nEven if one of the purposes of the China Initiative was to discourage undisclosed cooperation between Chinese universities and American ones , rather than policing outright intellectual property theft , it \u2019 s still a worthwhile goal .\nJust because technology transfer was occurring using university appointments and no-show jobs , rather than something sexier , like loading blueprints onto a thumb drive before fleeing the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a problem .\nOne notable feature of the China Initiative was its attempt to combat the work of these \u201c nontraditional collectors , \u201d mostly students , academics , or researchers , who are sometimes coerced , sometimes not , into spying for China .\n\u201c China \u2019 s most systematic channel for identifying foreign-based nontraditional collectors , \u201d wrote Larry Diamond and Orville Schell in 2018 , is the Thousand Talents program , which connects top intellectual talent with Chinese universities .\nThere are 19 China Initiative cases connected to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the subjects were Chinese either : The one who worked at Los Alamos wasn \u2019 t .\nDanhua \u2019 s Shoucheng Zhang was a Thousand Talents participant as well .\nA full accounting of the China Initiative is somewhat difficult because the Department of Justice hasn \u2019 t been clear about what constitutes a China Initiative case .\nWhen the MIT Technology Review requested comment from the DOJ for an influential piece about the China Initiative , the DOJ deleted a number of cases from their list online .\nThe Review put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 of those involved economic espionage charges , and over time the focus shifted toward more \u201c research integrity \u201d cases , which were often dropped .\nBy 2020 , half of the China Initiative \u2019 s cases , according to the MIT Technology Review \u2019 s count , were research integrity cases .\nIt \u2019 s true most of the defendants are Chinese\u201490 percent\u2014but most of them also had a \u201c nexus to China \u201d much more substantial than their race .\nThere are also a fair number of non-Chinese , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hansen .\nThis is relevant because critics of the China Initiative have claimed that the \u201c nexus to China \u201d the DOJ was looking for was nothing more than Chinese ancestry , a plainly untrue claim .\nA January letter to the Biden administration from the Brennan Center and several Asian-American groups claimed \u201c these investigations target individuals with any \u2018 nexus to China , \u2019 which often is merely ancestral , leading to profiling by race , ethnicity , and national origin.\n\u201d This is nonsense .\nThe \u201c nexus to China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the professors \u2019 employment at Chinese universities .\nIt has nothing to do with their ancestry and everything to do with their affiliation with a PRC-controlled institution .\nEven in the cases that have fallen apart , it \u2019 s hard to argue racial profiling .\nThe ACLU took on Xiaoxing Xi , a physicist at Temple who was accused of passing schematics to Chinese scientists , and said : \u201c The FBI \u2019 s conduct in Xi \u2019 s case and others suggests that the government has been targeting Chinese-Americans because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOJ got it wrong in this case\u2014he wasn \u2019 t sharing what they thought he was sharing\u2014but he was communicating with PRC-based scientists about superconductors while working on DOD-funded research .\nThat \u2019 s probably what put him in the DOJ \u2019 s crosshairs , not his race .\nWhat remains to be seen is whether the official end of the China Initiative changes much at all .\n\u201c It is absolutely unclear to me what the China Initiative being \u2018 over \u2019 means , \u201d wrote Axios reporter Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s primarily a name change and a publicly stated commitment to not bring criminal charges against academics for filing poor paperwork.\n\u201d It \u2019 s not even clear that these picayune investigations of lying professors are going to stop now that the China Initiative has been officially axed .\nThis March , it was reported that Yale biologist Haifan Lin was under investigation over discrepancies in reporting between NIH and his university .\nAnd the DOJ hasn \u2019 t dropped the prosecution of Franklin Tao at the University of Kansas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other significant parts of the China Initiative remain in place as well , like FIRRMA .\nBy most accounts , the stronger scrutiny of China-related business transactions is continuing under Biden .\nCFIUS blocked a deal for South Korean semiconductor company Magnachip last year .\nAll the same , it \u2019 s a pity that today the DOJ finds itself unable to put a name to what everyone agrees is the nation \u2019 s number one counterintelligence threat .\nIt \u2019 s hard to have much sympathy for the accused professors either .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in being caught in the middle of two great powers pulling apart , with one foot on each side , in a profession that prides itself on free inquiry unencumbered by petty national concerns , but most of them also seem to have behaved duplicitously toward their American universities or the U.S. government .\nThat the DOJ is forced to back off from these prosecutions speaks to the extraordinary privileges our society accords to academics , and the woke priorities of the Biden administration .", "author": "Arthur Bloom", "url": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-china-initiative-wasnt-racist/",

about the far right .\nSo says the jacket of their new book , out this week .\nThey \u2019 re Brits , too .\nThat \u2019 s all I know about them .\nI know a little bit of them now , however , having read some 130 pages of their writing ( not the end notes ) : mainly that they seem to be earnest chaps , sincere in their efforts to do the work .\nThis book is short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every page , pop academic leftism doing its best to be as fair as being helpful to the cause will allow .\nTo be clear , I am not recommending this book to most of my readers .\nIts definitions are baroque and boutique , and the argumentation unsatisfyingly semantic .\nIt is as breezy as acadamese gets , but it is still written in the language of contemporary social science .\nIf , however , you are something of a researcher yourself , perhaps an activist of sorts , maybe even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 ll find a leftist survey of right-wing ecological thought mildly interesting .\nAfter all , you may not be interested in climate politics , but climate politics is interested in you .\nI don \u2019 t regret the couple hours I spent with The Rise of Ecofascism ; it is illustrative , not only semi-informative .\nWhat it illustrates is the reality that , when it comes to environmental activism , serious leftists find themselves in a bit of a bind .\n\u201c Climate justice \u201d looks a lot like globalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking have a long , if occasionally sordid , pedigree on the right , more so probably than the left .\nThe right , in its particularism and recognition of difference , sees the relationship between the environment and the person , and in seeking to preserve a mode of life naturally seeks the conservation of place .\nThe left , in its commitment to liberating humanity from all inequalities , seeks to flatten distinctions , and especially in the Marxist vein has historically seen the formation of mass industrialized society and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the synthetic march to a classless future where , without the crucial intervention of Christ \u2019 s kingship , Every valley shall be exalted , and every mountain and hill shall be made low .\nThis is a flattening that closely resembles the reduction of humanity to homo economicus and aspirations to global governance that characterize what leftists prefer to call \u201c neoliberalism.\n\u201d This \u201c capitalist \u201d world order , like the left , also focuses on a planetary scale , and thus on climate and carbon and temperature ( that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of causality in both cases ) , while playing a cups and ball game with unsustainable and degrading industrial practices .\nIn their honesty Moore and Roberts recognize that similarity , and why those on the right might find it more than a little suggestive .\nThey write : That last parenthetical holds the semantic out for leftists like Moore and Roberts .\nThey do not support the free movement of people because it represents a growing client class , as it does for the liberal establishment , or depresses wages and bargaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does for multinational corporations .\nInstead , \u201c climate justice \u201d demands that the global south invade the global north , a form of reparations , the redistribution of wealth to make up for a history represented as exclusively predatory and exploitative .\n\u201c We must identify , defend and amplify ecological relations which restore and respect natural systems whilst attacking systems of private ownership of the means of production and attempting to re-common the world , \u201d they write .\nThere will be no private property and thus no ill-gotten gains after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the right that all comes out to the same thing , class war , the destruction first of the middle-class economy in which the natural family can thrive and , eventually , of the nation .\nAgain , Moore and Roberts seem sincere , sincere enough to recognize that the systems of control suggested by efforts to cool the entire planet sound like the makings of a totalitarian future , which they insist is not what their idea of solidarity demands .\nThe main thing , of course , is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right \u2019 s attempts to answer the problems of ecological disorder will not be the left \u2019 s , for they will not be global in scope .\nWe , like Moore and Roberts , \u201c acknowledge \u2014 as many in the climate movement have argued for years \u2014 that much of the struggle needs to be over the conditions of adaptation .\nIndeed , politics is a rather more responsive system than the climate.\n\u201d But being on the right , and American , I consider these environmental concerns in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being on the left , and Brits , in a backwater with limited self-determination in our current global order , Moore and Roberts consider environmental concerns in international and post-national terms .\n\u201c Whatever forms of parochialism are brought against it , the climate crisis remains determinedly planetary in scope , \u201d they write .\n\u201c Solidarity within , at and across borders is therefore essential.\n\u201d This solidarity \u201c is an attempt to overcome the split from which governance derives its power .\nGovernance masks prior unity.\n\u201d This presumed pale-blue-dot human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dei , humanity \u2019 s equality as creature , gets at the heart of an anthropological divide vital to all political questions .\nRight and left agree , scarcity as such is a matter of conflict , not of natural potential , but where the right sees in this conflict a reaction to locality and natural difference , the left sees an unnatural imposition , only libido dominandi .\nThe religious right can point to fallenness here , but also to a theological tradition that sees natural government as existing in potential even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expulsion from the garden ; had our first parents remained in growing grace , they and their children would still have not been identical , equal in an earthly sense , because of differences of age and sex and aptitude , and so authority and direction would still be needed for the full flourishing of that unfallen human community .\nIn his political philosophy qua business book Zero to One , cowritten with Arizona Senate candidate Blake Masters , Peter Thiel presents four quadrants for speculating about the future .\nOn one axis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on the other is definite and indefinite thought .\nMoore and Roberts seem unable to pick a plane for their thinking .\nThey write : Some of these are , of course , definite factors under consideration , in a book whose very purpose is to point out a cause for definite pessimism on the part of the left , namely that the right will have more compelling definite answers to the complex of issues labeled a climate emergency .\nBut the concluding optimism in reply is as indefinite as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of which are equally confident some sort of technological discovery will make old industrial systems sustainable or so-called renewable systems work without driving energy costs up too much .\nMoore and Roberts write , \u201c Solidarity is not just an obligation .\nIt should also be a mode of enlivening , a mode of extracting ourselves from our parochialism and opening out into the planetary ecology we collectively live through.\n\u201d Enlivening sounds very nice , but it is not a cause for definite hope .\nThe trouble for the serious leftists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the neoliberal masters of the universe they despise , they want global action .\nAt the planetary scale , everything becomes indefinite , and a commitment to class conflict against the bourgeois middle means obvious and existent state-level solutions , such as nuclear power , are off the table .\nCheap electricity will perpetuate reactionary social arrangements , or something like that .\nBut the right is all about the definite : definite places , definite people , definite solutions .\nThere is solidarity in the nation and the family ; natio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , has a real chance of providing a more compelling alternative as the nexus of political problems that are put under the label \u201c climate \u201d comes to a head in the next couple decades , problems such as mass migration and energy supply and food production and natural disasters and declining birth rates and hormonal disruption and mass die-off .\nMoore and Roberts are almost there when they write , \u201c We are dependent on a particular climatic system , a fact which , for most of us , modernity has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Americans \u201d and \u201c climatic \u201d with \u201c environmental.\n\u201d As they put it , \u201c Thus , solidarity must extend not just to those humans and societies upon which we depend , but to the more-than-human nature that we exist within as well.\n\u201d From sea to shining sea .", "author": "Micah Meadowcroft",

the House Paul Ryan delivers a farewell address in the Great Hall of the Library of Congress Jefferson Building on Capitol Hill December 19 , 2018 in Washington , D.C. ( Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images ) Paul Ryan knows that conservatives are at war\u2014with one another .\nAnd his side is losing .\nThe former House speaker appeared on a panel with Matthew Continetti and moderator Yuval Levin earlier this week at the American Enterprise Institute , where they discussed Continetti \u2019 s new book The Right : The Hundred Year War for American Conservatism .\nRyan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite so long , but from the time he got into politics some 30 years ago he knew who his enemies were : the populist , nationalist , paleoconservative right .\nContinetti \u2019 s book has already received a great deal of attention , and more is on the way .\nI \u2019 ll be moderating a panel with him myself on May 25 , when we \u2019 ll join Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts and Yoram Hazony for a discussion of issues related to Hazony \u2019 s new book Conservatism : A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks at AEI deserve attention in their own right .\nAlthough he \u2019 s been out of public office for two years now , he remains the best representative of the Republican Party \u2019 s pre-Trump orthodoxy .\nAs a fellow panelist quipped , if history had taken a different turn in 2012 this might be the second year of a Paul Ryan presidency .\nTo his credit , the former speaker didn \u2019 t seem at all bitter .\nBut it was remarkable to hear him describe in his own terms the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative politics since his days as a young wonk in the early 1990s .\n\u201c We were fighting the paleocons at the time , \u201d Ryan said , \u201c which was Pat Buchanan , a little bit of Perot , and\u2014it was funny , I grew up , I read from college on , the National Review\u2014but it was Brimelow , O \u2019 Sullivan , and guys like that over at the National Review.\n\u201d On the other side , the one where his own sympathies lay , Ryan alluded to the Project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s policy-advocacy group founded by Bill Kristol a few years before he launched The Weekly Standard .\n\u201c So you had what were the neocons fighting the paleocons , and then some other groups in there.\n\u201d At the time John O \u2019 Sullivan was the editor of National Review , and Peter Brimelow , an outspoken immigration restrictionist , was a senior editor before he started his own website , VDARE.com .\nO \u2019 Sullivan , a former aide to Margaret Thatcher , was not exactly a Buchananite .\nHe supported a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the Cold War than Buchanan did , even looking to build a \u201c Conintern \u201d of conservatives from across the Anglosphere to advance a common economic and strategic vision .\nBut with O \u2019 Sullivan at the helm , National Review did , in his own words , \u201c give a tactical endorsement of Pat Buchanan in the New Hampshire , \u2018 Super Tuesday , \u2019 and Michigan primaries \u201d in the struggle for the 1992 GOP presidential nomination .\nMagazines like NR were a scorecard of the right \u2019 s civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paleoconservatives had a presence in National Review , the Washington Times , and a controlling interest in Chronicles , while the neoconservatives had Commentary and significant representation in The American Spectator , where the Canadian journalist David Frum made his name by attacking Buchanan .\nIf this configuration had persisted , the conservative movement might have taken a populist turn decades before Donald Trump \u2019 s victory in 2016 , with NR holding together a fractious but not fragmented coalition of nationalist paleoconservatives and Reaganite stalwarts .\nBut Bill Kristol changed the equation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he first , it seems , made a bid to take over National Review as sketched in David Frisk \u2019 s biography of longtime NR publisher Bill Rusher , If Not Us , Who ?\nWhen Buckley refused to sell , Murdoch \u2019 s money eventually went into the creation of a new Kristol vehicle , the Weekly Standard , in 1995 .\nThe Weekly Standard was based in Washington , D.C. , and from the start combined neoconservative politics with intrepid political reporting as Republicans took over Congress for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York , had been outflanked by an upstart that was published twice as often and whose editors had ready access to another new Murdoch venture , Fox News .\nMomentum shifted to the neocons , not only in the battle between magazines but within National Review itself .\nIn 1997 Rich Lowry replaced O \u2019 Sullivan as editor .\nThe brief window where NR could be described even by Paul Ryan as \u201c paleoconservative \u201d had closed .\nMagazines were one index of rising neoconservative power .\nAnother was the proliferation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agenda of \u201c democratic capitalism \u201d at home and abroad , meaning more immigration , free-trade agreements , and a police-like role for America in international affairs .\nRyan got his start in politics at one of these institutions .\n\u201c I was at a think tank called Empower America , founded by Jeane Kirkpatrick , Bill Bennett , and Jack Kemp\u2014there \u2019 s the fusion right there .\nThey were basically the titular heads of the three different movements , \u201d Ryan told Yuval Levin at Wednesday \u2019 s panel .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Bennett , who had served as George H.W .\nBush \u2019 s \u201c drug czar , \u201d had positioned himself as a social conservative ; and Kemp , as a congressman , had been a supply-sider even before Reagan .\nOver time Kemp and especially Kirkpatrick would come to have doubts about the neoconservatives \u2019 foreign policy .\nBut in the early \u2019 90s , as Ryan reminisced , they were in the neoconservative orbit .\nAnd so was Ryan , though he told the audience at AEI , \u201c I \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neocon as much as I thought of myself as a supply-sider.\n\u201d When National Review senior editor Frank S. Meyer worked out the set of ideas that came to be called \u201c fusionism \u201d in the 1960s and early \u2019 70s , he was not thinking about policy prescriptions so much as a philosophical interpretation of history : He believed that the West \u2019 s Christian morality and commitment to liberty , while in tension , were parts of a single whole .\nRyan \u2019 s account shows how the conservative movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFusionism now meant a mix of three kinds of policy priorities .\nImmediate political battles rose to the fore .\nIn Ryan \u2019 s telling : \u201c When the Reagan era ended with the defeat of H.W .\nBush by Clinton\u2026the conservative movement turned inward and shot at each other , \u201d which did not abate \u201c until a standard bearer emerged , meaning a nominee\u2014in this case it was W. [ George W. Bush ] , who won \u201d but whose \u201c compassionate conservatism\u2026never really took hold , I would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of circumstances , you know , wars and the rest.\n\u201d Policy rather than philosophy is the basis for \u201c a solid fusion \u201d as Ryan understands it .\nAfter George W. Bush the conflicts that had divided the right before his administration reemerged .\nOver the last three decades , continued Ryan , \u201c I think we \u2019 ve had pauses , we \u2019 ve won some White Houses , but we \u2019 ve never settled into a posture of a majoritarian center-right movement that is capable of racking up consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place a governing agenda for the 21st century.\n\u201d Instead , there has been \u201c churn , \u201d and \u201c right now it \u2019 s dominated by Trump .\nWhich is populism , just pure rank , untethered-to-principle populism , cult of personality populism , which is really not an agenda , a theory ; it \u2019 s a person .\nSo I think we \u2019 re still in this churn , and I think underneath that is the kind of fight we had in the early \u2019 90s , is the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with digital.\n\u201d He would explain what \u201c digital \u201d meant a little later .\nFirst Ryan described how he had hoped the Tea Party would give rise to \u201c supply side 2.0 , \u201d an agenda of \u201c pro-growth economics , limited government , get the debt and entitlements under control , and a robust foreign policy.\n\u201d That was the agenda he wanted to pursue in the House of Representatives , though \u201c on the issues of trade and immigration there was a fight , but we sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we really tapped the Tea Party movement .\nWe got the majority back.\n\u201d Trade and immigration would not remain off to the side , however : \u201c In hindsight , this is just me looking back , we didn \u2019 t understand\u2026the potency of those issues , the power of those issues , and [ what ] I think the establishment Republicans , people like me included , missed was just the effects of issues like trade and immigration on the forgotten man .\nAnd how that really played into not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perception.\n\u201d Speaker Ryan and his Republican majority \u201c were more focused on just the Tea Party movement , re-limiting government , kind of libertarian\u2026all of us more or less agreeing on strong national defense .\nSo the isolationism hadn \u2019 t crept in yet , like it is now , at that time .\nAnd what ended up happening was I think the trade and immigration issue sort of overtook the movement , and the Tea Party morphed into something like what it is today.\n\u201d For Ryan that means a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nice Guy \u201d style , in which \u201c the entertainment wing of our party \u201d is ascendant in the \u201c digital age \u201d : \u201c the entertainers sort of replaced the think-tank type people , replaced sort of the intellectual Buckleyites.\n\u201d There is an outline of a different kind of conservative history here , a history not of factional fights but of changing genres .\nThe first incarnation of the postwar conservative movement\u2014the \u201c intellectual Buckleyites , \u201d of whom Buckley was the least intellectual ( though entirely indispensable for coordinating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neither divorced from but nor consumed by politics or policy .\nThe second incarnation of the conservative movement , post-Reagan ( or perhaps from Reagan onward ) was a movement not of ideas but of proposals , and in that it arguably resembled the very managerial liberalism that conservatives had formerly abhorred .\nThe failure of this second , policy-centric form of conservatism has been profound .\nNot only has it failed to secure sufficient electoral support to hold power in the long term , long enough to enact a substantial agenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the affections of conservative voters themselves .\nThe policies are simply irrelevant , too far removed from the cultural conflicts and the personal woes voters on the right live with every day .\nThe third and latest form of conservatism , \u201c the entertainment wing , \u201d is triumphing over Ryan-style technocracy because it actually speaks to what conservatives care about .\nWords sometimes do matter as much as deeds , or matter more than policy \u201c solutions \u201d that never pass or never adjust to the ugly realities of 21st-century America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the panel suggested that he has not really opened his eyes to the new dispensation , even if he understands at an intellectual level how immigration and trade became stumbling blocks for his politics .\nTaking stock of the welfare state ( in particular \u201c health , retirement security \u201d ) , he said , \u201c I think you have to reconcile our life with these programs.\u2026 These are settled issues , I would argue.\u2026 Then the question is how do you go about achieving those in the best possible way to maximize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , in your economy .\nAnd so once you get over the fact that these programs exist and we have a social contract that we all agree should exist , then let \u2019 s get on to the task of repairing them from bankruptcy and making them perform the best.\n\u201d For Ryan , the trouble with the left is it \u201c wants government to run it all , they want no private sector , they want command of resources , means of production , they want to use it as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use the power of markets and choice and competition to deliver these services that we all as a country have reached consensus on .\nThat may sound like me-tooism .\nIt \u2019 s just radical pragmatism.\n\u201d He went on to warn about loss of the dollar \u2019 s reserve-currency status and about an eventual debt crisis , and there is surely a need for good , practical policies to avert those outcomes .\nBut his basically utilitarian understanding of politics has proven inadequate to the times , and not just in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrasting his politics with the conservatism of \u201c the blood and soil nationalists , which is this European flavor of populism that \u2019 s [ now ] here on the right , [ and ] disregards the uniqueness of the American idea of a country based on natural law\u2026 \u201d Rather than ascending from natural law to nature and Nature \u2019 s God , however , Ryan descends to calling for \u201c a movement that can have great debates on policy matters within the sphere of these principles .\nAnd we won \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a party or a movement that is capable of having a strong , vibrant debate not dominated by just one personality.\u2026 This kind of populism is one that \u2019 s not tethered to principles .\nWe can get to a populism , and I think we will , that is tethered to principles.\u2026 I do believe the country is yearning for this.\n\u201d The reflexive invocation of \u201c European \u201d conservatism\u2014Burke ?\nChurchill ?\nDe Gaulle ?\nMetternich ?\n\u2014is cheap scaremongering .\nThere is no possibility of America adopting anyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forgotten , some of Europe \u2019 s worst right-wing regimes learned a few lessons about race laws from the good old U.S.A .\nBut Ryan is right if he thinks American conservatives must take America more seriously .\nThey might even want to put America first .\nSlogans aside , that means dealing with Americans as the men and women they are , and not as mere clients for \u201c policy .\n\u201d", "author": "Daniel McCarthy", "url": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-neocons-lose-one-last-war/", "published": "Fri, 29

APRIL 26 : Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-KY ) departs a news conference following the Senate Republican policy luncheon at the U.S. Capitol on April 26 , 2022 in Washington , DC .\nMcConnell was asked about Billionaire Elon Musk 's purchase of Twitter and he said , `` We 're all watching with a great deal of interest because there have been our share of complaints about the way it 's been running . ''\n( Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images ) As Congress comes back into session with a packed agenda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undo former President Trump \u2019 s trade policies toward China .\nLast year , the House and the Senate passed two different bills related to America \u2019 s China trade policy : the House passed the America COMPETES bill , and the Senate passed the U.S .\nInnovation and Competition Act ( USICA ) .\nThe trade provisions in the COMPETES bill have been widely praised by institutions that share Trump \u2019 s economic approach to China .\nDespite being Democrat-sponsored legislation , COMPETES has earned praise from such institutions because , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de minimis loophole for Chinese imports .\nThe de minimis loophole allows shipments with a declared value under $ 800 to enter the U.S. tariff-free , which Chinese importers have used to their advantage .\nFurthermore , COMPETES would shore up the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill by making eligible for tariff reductions only those intermediate goods which go into final products produced in the United States .\nThere were plenty of reasons why Republicans objected to COMPETES , mostly related to the bill \u2019 s non-trade provisions .\nCOMPETES would have created a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exempted high-skilled immigrants ( those with doctorates or master \u2019 s degrees ) from caps on green cards for immigrants from specific countries , for instance .\nIt also included progressive provisions to liberalize banking laws on behalf of marijuana growers and dispensaries .\n\u201c The intention in [ COMPETES ] is there , \u201d Conservative Partnership Institute Senior Director of Policy Rachel Bovard told TAC .\n\u201c I have no problem with the idea that we need to maneuver our public policy to directly address the threat China poses , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate agenda , sending everything to the National Science Foundation , ensuring that all the research funding gets held up in identity politics and victimology , et cetera.\n\u201d When the House voted on COMPETES in February , just one Republican , Adam Kinzinger of Illinois , voted in favor of the bill\u2014and not because Kinzinger shares the former president \u2019 s view on trade .\nLast June , the USICA passed easily in the Senate by a vote of 68-32 .\nUSICA \u2019 s trade section would reinstate 2,200 exemptions for China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Specifically , the USICA takes a sledgehammer to Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 , which allows the president to respond to breaches by foreign countries of U.S. trade agreements or other foreign trade practices deemed improper .\nTrump used Section 301 to place tariffs on a large number of Chinese imports to the tune of an additional 25 percent in response to intellectual property theft .\nDespite the political establishment and corporate media \u2019 s pearl clutching , the tariffs on Chinese imports were popular , which is likely why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undo them , though it has handed out just over 350 tariff exemptions for certain Chinese goods .\nSection 301 is the chief executive \u2019 s main tool in the kit to decouple the American economy from China , but the USICA would render it virtually inoperable , while giving large handouts to Chinese importers .\nUnder the USICA , Chinese firms would be allowed to claim \u201c lost profitability \u201d via tariffs on goods to get an exemption from Section 301 tariffs .\nIt would also refund Section 301 tariffs paid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exemption at the end of 2020 .\nIf this refund provision remains in the final bill , the U.S. Treasury will be forced to send billions of dollars to Chinese firms within 90 days of the bill becoming law .\nUSICA would also present the U.S. Trade Representative with a number of regulatory hoops to jump through in order to deny tariff waivers for products made in China .\nFailure to navigate this obstacle course in a timely manner would automatically give reprieve to the Chinese importer .\nThe Trade Representative is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of passing up cheap Chinese imports .\nBecause of this regulatory burden and other factors , the USICA would empower the World Trade Organization to serve as the de facto authorizer of any Section 301 tariffs imposed by the president .\n\u201c In a WTO dispute , the way it works is you file something called a consultation request , and that triggers a timeline , \u201d explained Charles Benoit , trade counsel at the Coalition for a Prosperous America .\n\u201c Now , the WTO doesn \u2019 t have an army or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can \u2019 t compel a losing party to comply .\nSo , if a country loses a WTO case , and they don \u2019 t remedy the situation , then what the WTO does is authorize retaliation \u201d through certain , targeted tariffs that match the WTO \u2019 s assessed amount in damages .\nSection 301 allows the president to retaliate against another country in the event of a favorable WTO ruling in a trade dispute .\n\u201c What USICA does is it makes 301 unusable by imposing insane burdens with one exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burdens do not apply if the tariffs are being imposed subsequent to a WTO ruling , \u201d Benoit said .\n\u201c So it \u2019 s saying , \u2018 Hey , this trade remedy is only okay to use if a court in Geneva says so.\n\u2019 \u201d Defanging Section 301 and rendering it a domestic legal mechanism for the enforcement of WTO arbitration is the corporate world \u2019 s revenge for Trump \u2019 s actions against China .\n\u201c The multinationals , Business Roundtable , and the Chamber of Commerce were aghast that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked all the domestic law boxes \u201d while pursuing tariffs against China , Benoit said , \u201c the administration ignored the WTO , \u201d because there was no WTO redress for intellectual property theft .\n\u201c Of course , it would be a bridge too far if they came out and said , \u2018 we \u2019 re taking authority away from the president , and handing it to a Geneva court , \u2019 \u201d he added .\n\u201c So they \u2019 re salting the earth and making 301 impossible to use unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions aside , there is plenty of pork in the USICA that Republicans may object to as well .\nNevertheless , 19 Republicans , mostly the ilk of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , voted in favor of the bill .\nMcConnell was joined by Senators Lindsey Graham , Mitt Romney , and Ben Sasse , among others .\nAs was the case in the Senate \u2019 s infrastructure battle , these Republicans are willing to put up with progressive priorities as long as it means the U.S. has access to cheap imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may mimic Trump and talk a tough game when it comes to China , but their voting record shows their true colors .\n\u201c Republicans are still on autopilot , \u201d Benoit said with a tone of both disappointment and frustration .\n\u201c Republicans , especially on Ways and Means and Senate Finance , which are two key committees , are still taking their marching orders from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable like they have been for our adult lives and longer .\nThat \u2019 s what \u2019 s going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their constituents , \u201d he added .\n\u201c Zero regard.\n\u201d \u201c I don \u2019 t think that they [ some Senate Republicans ] were ever actually on board with that part of the Trump agenda anyway , \u201d Bovard said .\n\u201c I think there was a willingness to just not say anything , or not say anything too loudly when Trump began waging a tariff war on China .\nAlthough I think there was a fair bit of grumbling about it , I don \u2019 t think that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea that they were going to protect this part of the Trump agenda , I don \u2019 t think that they see it , or ever saw it , that way .\nIt is sort of like the divide that existed when Trump was trying to use emergency powers to build the border wall.\n\u201d Though some Senate Republicans are now trying to gut Trump \u2019 s China tariffs , Bovard said , \u201c I think everyone at least agrees with Trump \u2019 s critique of what \u2019 s going on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does not think \u201c the Republican Party is unified around an agenda to actually address the issue.\n\u201d \u201c There are still people within the right who believe that you can just out compete China , but it \u2019 s far more complicated than that .\nIn many ways , China uses our system against us .\nIt \u2019 s not state actor versus state actor .\nThey weaponize private business against our values and against our system , \u201d Bovard went on to say .\n\u201c Look at companies like TikTok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese state , and yet our policies , in many ways , still treat them like they are just any other private enterprise when they \u2019 re not .\nI think that \u2019 s also true when you look at our own companies that want to do business in China and are prepared to give up whatever they have to give up to access that market .\nThat \u2019 s something our public policy hasn \u2019 t dealt with.\n\u201d \u201c In their defense , \u201d Bovard added , \u201c I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but\u2026it seems to me the institutional Republican actors , particularly in the Senate , haven \u2019 t figured out how to channel that into something productive.\n\u201d Most Senate Republicans who rejected the USICA kept quiet , afraid of running afoul McConnell \u2019 s political machine .\nSens .\nJosh Hawley , Marco Rubio , and Tom Cotton , however , went to bat for Trump \u2019 s China policy .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t support a bill that harms American workers and cuts tariffs on products made in China in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 \u201d Hawley said in a statement regarding the USICA last year .\n\u201c For decades , US policy makers have watched as millions of American jobs were shipped overseas , corporate America sold out to the Chinese Communist Party , and our industrial economy was replaced by slave labor in Xinjiang .\nWe must correct the failed Washington consensus that has allowed Beijing to thrive at the expense of working Americans.\n\u201d The chambers have now put together a conference committee to reconcile the two bills , where Republicans are now pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands and other excesses in both COMPETES and the USICA , but instead to ensure the USICA \u2019 s trade provisions make it into the legislation that Biden will likely sign into law .\nSenate Republicans in the conference committee have drawn a line in the sand with respect to some of COMPETES \u2019 trade provisions , threatening to pull their support if they end up in the revised legislation .\nSenate Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo , a Republican from Idaho who authored the trade provisions with Chairman Ron Wyden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundation \u201d of the conference committee \u2019 s final product .\nSenator Todd Young , R-Indiana , echoed Crapo \u2019 s statement , saying the conference committee \u2019 s version must \u201c resemble fairly closely the Senate bill in order to retain Republican support.\n\u201d Hawley , Rubio , and Cotton have been iced out of the conference process , which Bovard told TAC , \u201c is not unusual , \u201d given they did not support the bill in the first place .\n\u201c That being said , leadership and the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Bovard continued .\n\u201c If they actually wanted someone to make that case , they could \u2019 ve appointed someone to the conference committee like those guys to make it .\nLike I said , I don \u2019 t think the Republican Party has a coherent vision for what they view as a trade agenda at this point , so I don \u2019 t think having a robust debate about this in a conference committee is something they \u2019 re focused on.\n\u201d But even without some of the most vocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the table , \u201c there \u2019 s so many ways that this process is getting hamstrung , \u201d Bovard added .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not going to be surprised if there \u2019 s a jailbreak of Republicans against it because it \u2019 s just getting so bogged down by other priorities , and that \u2019 s the problem that you have on the left .\nYou can \u2019 t have an honest conversation about this with the left because they have 18 other priorities and everything is like gender identity.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increasing number of legislators are anti-tariffs goes beyond their adherence to globalizing liberal economic orthodoxy .\nOne of the problems , Benoit told TAC , is , \u201c we \u2019 ve lost so much of our manufacturing at this point , \u201d that there aren \u2019 t many members of Congress with large manufacturing constituencies to oppose members whose constituents heavily rely on imports .\n\u201c If a producer has outsourced its manufacturing , they will lobby vigorously for tariff cuts , but if they \u2019 re producing domestically , then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tariffs.\n\u201d \u201c How do we get Congress to write a new , protective tariff , when a majority of our producers are manufacturing overseas ?\n\u201d Benoit said .\n\u201c That \u2019 s a huge problem .\n\u201d", "author": "Bradley Devlin", "url":

batting away kooky claims about malign forces working secretly to direct the course of history for their own benefit .\nBut in an effort to take down Tucker Carlson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so widened the definition of a conspiracy theorist as to catch me in its dragnet .\nI hail from Iran , where state TV might casually suggest , for example , that Pepsi is actually a Zionist acronym ( \u201c pay each

economic developments on the almost-providential power of individual malefactors .\nIt makes no room for the possibility of accidents and coincidences .\nAnd it paralyzes authentic political action ;

support between Republican and Democratic presidential candidates in the decades following the passage of the Civil Rights Act , the state decisively broke for Donald Trump in both 2016 and 2020 .\nAs the electorate grows more solidly Republican , candidates like Jake Bequette are challenging perceived \u201c establishment \u201d candidates like the Trump-endorsed incumbent , Senator John Boozman .\nBequette , a former professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after playing for the University of Arkansas Razorbacks ) and Army Ranger , is hoping that the state \u2019 s allegiance to former President Trump signals a populist shift within the Arkansan electorate that will sweep self-described \u201c America First \u201d candidates to power\u2014even those , like Bequette , who didn \u2019 t win Trump \u2019 s endorsement .\nJohn Boozman has a long history in national politics .\nHe ousted a Democratic incumbent in his election to the House of Representatives in 2001 , and served in the lower chamber for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2011 .\nHe is a member of the Senate Agriculture and Veterans Affairs committees , both of which attend to issues vital to everyday Arkansans .\nBoozman is described by insiders as a quiet figure who represents an older brand of conservative politics , and his reputation as an establishment politician derives as much from his style as his record .\n\u201c Boozman is a mild-mannered guy\u2026 .\nHe \u2019 s not going to be the guy that grabs the megaphone and starts screaming the loudest in the room , \u201d said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ & Politics , a news organization covering politics in Arkansas .\n\u201c He \u2019 s a lot more , as he describes himself , of a workman kind of candidate and politician.\n\u201d Jake Bequette argues that Boozman is insufficiently conservative for deep-red Arkansas , pointing to Boozman \u2019 s votes to confirm progressive judges and for budgets that fund Planned Parenthood .\nHe claims Boozman \u2019 s demure persona and reluctance to do media make the incumbent the wrong choice for an electorate that wants big , bold leadership .\n\u201c I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Arkansas and across the country , they recognize there is a huge chasm between the beating heart of the grassroots , the base , and their elected leaders , \u201d Bequette said .\n\u201c I think the people of Arkansas realized that Senator Boozman is not leading from the front.\n\u201d Boozman and Bequette differ sharply on foreign policy .\nBoozman has said he believes in a \u201c proactive foreign policy agenda \u201d and boasts of having authored the Women \u2019 s Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment ( WEEE ) Act , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barriers and empower female entrepreneurs around the world.\n\u201d Boozman recently called for the transfer of Polish fighter jets to Ukraine , signed a letter calling on the Biden administration to send additional military aid to Israel , and said he believes that a \u201c proactive \u201d American presence on the world stage has played a role \u201c in ending global health epidemics \u201d and \u201c reduc [ ing ] the trafficking of arms.\n\u201d Bequette frames his foreign policy in terms of America \u2019 s national interest .\n\u201c I \u2019 m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Iraq , it didn \u2019 t take me very long to understand the folly of nation building , of trying to impose or to project our ideas of a nation state or a civil society on a country that simply doesn \u2019 t have that foundation , \u201d Bequette said .\n\u201c And I think that there \u2019 s a corollary to that in Eastern Europe .\nWe should be fighting to secure our own borders .\nWe should be fighting to secure our own territorial sovereignty of defending American citizens before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontier of Eastern Europe.\n\u201d Bequette describes himself as an \u201c America First \u201d candidate , and his remarks on foreign policy certainly sound more Trumpian than Boozman \u2019 s focus on \u201c gender-related barriers \u201d facing \u201c female entrepreneurs around the world.\n\u201d But in early March , Trump endorsed Boozman , calling the incumbent \u201c a great fighter for the people of Arkansas \u201d who \u201c is tough on crime , strong on the border , a great supporter of our military and our vets.\n\u201d Boozman \u2019 s staff did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from The American Conservative , but highlighted the candidate \u2019 s endorsement from Trump and several prominent Arkansans .\n\u201c Senator Boozman has always been a workhorse , not a show pony , and he continues to visit every corner of the state running on the strong , conservative principles Arkansas Republicans know he fights for in the Senate .\nThat \u2019 s why President Trump , Sarah Huckabee Sanders , and Senator Cotton all agree he \u2019 s the candidate to back , \u201d said Jimmy Harris , Boozman \u2019 s campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s endorsement of the incumbent , Bequette has positioned himself as the Trumpier candidate in the race .\nIn an attempt to outflank Boozman , Bequette highlighted the incumbent \u2019 s remarks in a surreptitious recording from April , in which Boozman said there wasn \u2019 t widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election .\nBoozman , who has publicly endorsed the legitimacy of the 2020 election results , has also called the election \u201c free and fair.\n\u201d Bequette thinks Boozman \u2019 s remarks are typical of \u201c career politicians \u201d who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public , and then they say another thing behind closed doors , or when they think no one \u2019 s listening.\n\u201d If Mike Lindell-style machinations about the wiles of Dominion election software represent the \u201c hard \u201d version of the stolen-election theory , then Jake Bequette defended the \u201c soft \u201d version of the theory in an interview with The American Conservative , focusing on unconstitutional changes to state-level election laws in the run up to the 2020 election .\nBequette told me that he does not think the 2020 election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have voted to certify the election results if he were in the Senate at the time .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been very clear , that is one clear distinction between me and Senator Boozman , \u201d Bequette said .\n\u201c He said that the 2020 election was free and fair , which\u2014even some Republicans who say the election wasn \u2019 t stolen , they still won \u2019 t go as far as Senator Boozman did and agree with Joe Biden and that the election was free and fair .\nThat \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconstitutional changes made to state election laws using the pretext of the pandemic .\nI never would have voted to certify the 2020 election like Senator Boozman did.\n\u201d Brock said Boozman \u2019 s remarks could make a difference to populist elements within the Republican base in Arkansas , but thinks most voters who know and trusted Boozman in his prior election bids won \u2019 t be moved .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think it peels any of those [ more moderate ] voters off , at least not in a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still think that faction is bigger than this new-to-the-Republican-party group of voters who are upset about the 2020 election results.\n\u201d Bequette thinks he \u2019 s wrong , and hopes the populist energy in the state , focused on issues beyond the 2020 election , will put him over the top in May 24 \u2019 s Republican primary .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a strong populist streak in Arkansas .\nYou could put us firmly in the America First category , \u201d he said , \u201c and I \u2019 m the

S & P 's investment score .\nProgressive banks , asset managers , and regulators have successfully imposed the social credit system known as ESG , which stands for environmental , social , and governance , on corporations .\nIn their latest move , ESG will now be applied to states as well .\nOn March 31 , credit rating agency Standard & Poor \u2019 s ( S & P ) published its first ESG \u201c Report Card \u201d for every U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials , who are demanding that S & P drop this scoring system .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a political score , \u201d said Utah State Treasurer Marlo Oaks .\n\u201c We \u2019 re not going to play along with some outside organization giving us a political score that will determine whether we can borrow capital at the most advantageous rates or not.\n\u201d Rating agencies , such as S & P , Moody \u2019 s , and Fitch , provide credit scores for companies and governments that borrow money , similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores have traditionally been a quantitative measure of a borrower \u2019 s ability to repay and are a key factor in determining how much borrowers will pay in interest , or if they will be able to borrow at all .\nESG , by contrast , focuses on climate activism and social justice issues .\nAccording to S & P \u2019 s ESG Report Card , which grades states in each category on a 1 to 5 scale , with 1 being the most positive rating , Utah was graded a 3 out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of \u201c water challenges.\n\u201d The report stated that \u201c environmental factors are a moderately negative consideration in our credit rating analysis for Utah , \u201d citing concerns about how much water Utah may use as its population grows and climate change brings droughts .\n\u201c Utah has never been rated less than AAA , \u201d Oaks said , which is S & P \u2019 s highest credit score .\nAny material risks regarding Utah \u2019 s ability to repay debt had been included in this general credit rating , he said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ along and give us another score that could impact how inexpensively we can borrow money .\nIt \u2019 s ridiculous !\n\u201d A letter to S & P signed by Utah Gov .\nSpencer Cox , Attorney General Sean Reyes , Sens .\nMitt Romney and Mike Lee , and eight other U.S .\nRepresentatives and state officials including Oaks stated that \u201c S & P \u2019 s ESG credit indicators politicize what should be a purely financial decision .\nThis politicization has manifested itself in the capital markets where , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital to the oil , gas , coal and firearms industries .\nESG is a political rating and should be characterized as such.\n\u201d The State of Utah demanded that S & P provide information about how its ESG scores are determined , disclose any conflicts of interest , and explain \u201c to what extent the energy independence of free and democratic countries factors into your models , including the \u2018 social \u2019 factor in your ESG scores.\n\u201d West Virginia , which S & P cited for environmental and social concerns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a budget surplus , \u201c our fiscal health is in pristine order right now , \u201d said State Treasurer Riley Moore .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve been fiscally conservative and it has paid off hugely now that the economy has started to trend in a positive direction in West Virginia.\n\u201d But West Virginia got a negative environmental score from S & P because of the fact that \u201c we have a lower reliance on renewable energy sources , \u201d Moore said .\n\u201c We \u2019 re a fossil fuel state , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c If ESG scores hurt our bond rating , we \u2019 re going to be financially punished until we bend to their will .\nNone of us voted for this , we don \u2019 t have a say in this , but potentially we are going to be punished because we don \u2019 t fit their value set.\n\u201d In the social category , S & P gave West Virginia a 4 out of 5 and flagged concerns over its aging population , as well as its 0.3 percent net loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this population loss to political and financial initiatives against its fossil fuel industry , which has cost the state jobs .\nNew York , which set a record for population loss in 2021 , received a 2 in the social category .\nS & P declined to respond to the criticisms from state officials but highlighted the following statement on why they created the ESG Report Card : \u201c Through the release of ESG credit indicators , we aim to further delineate and summarize the relevance of ESG factors to our credit analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence and separating it from the non-ESG factors affecting the credit rating.\n\u201d ESG has been a cash cow for Wall Street , and so-called \u201c sustainable \u201d debt expanded to $ 723 billion in 2020 , a 23 percent increase from 2019 , according to a Morningstar report .\n\u201c In 2021 , new sustainable debt issuance outpaced all previous years combined.\n\u201d The rating agencies , in step with banks and asset managers , have invested large sums to profit from ESG .\nIn 2019 , S & P bought an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ & P also provides Corporate Sustainability Assessments to its clients indicating \u201c how your company \u2019 s sustainability performance compares with your peers and members of the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability Indices.\n\u201d The Dow Jones Sustainability Index , based on ESG scores , is produced by S & P and SAM .\nS & P \u2019 s main rival in the ratings business is Moody \u2019 s , which has also made substantial investments into ESG .\nIn 2021 , Moody \u2019 s bought RMS , which produces climate risk modeling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied ESG ratings to municipalities to date , but last year Moody \u2019 s announced it would provide separate ESG criteria for countries that issue debt .\nCritics question whether imposing ESG scores on issuers represents a conflict of interest for the agencies that paid billions in fines over conflicts and other improprieties leading up to the mortgage meltdown in 2008 .\n\u201c They \u2019 re both determining the metrics and judging , \u201d said Jack McPherrin , a research fellow at the Heartland Institute .\n\u201c They \u2019 re also purchasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determining what the actual risk factors are .\nThere \u2019 s no independent process here.\n\u201d Utah officials also charged that ESG ratings are opaque and arbitrary .\n\u201c Russian energy giants Gazprom and Rosneft outscored American energy companies ExxonMobil and Chevron on S & P \u2019 s ESG scale , \u201d they stated .\n\u201c S & P also gave the Chinese state-owned China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation a higher ESG score than ExxonMobil and Chevron , despite human rights violations.\n\u201d \u201c Each ratings company has their own set of metrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all have different scoring systems .\nIt \u2019 s a complete mess that \u2019 s designed to be confusing so that the people who are creating these metrics can manipulate the system however they want .\nIt \u2019 s doubtful they really care that much about any specific metrics ; they \u2019 re just using them to institutionalize a framework of control over the market.\n\u201d State officials are also concerned that the ESG ratings phenomenon could spread beyond municipalities to individuals .\n\u201c At one point we were talking about ESG scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Moore said .\n\u201c Now they \u2019 re moving toward states and municipalities .\nI think this is going to filter down to a personal level eventually.\n\u201d Moody \u2019 s was contacted for this article but did not respond .\nKevin Stocklin is a writer , film director , and founder of Second Act Films , an independent production house

Jackson Women \u2019 s Health case currently on the docket .\nThe reality of this has sobered me .\nFor a left which has already shown contempt for the Supreme Court , with calls to pack it in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , it is clear that Roe will not die with a whimper .\nRoe is apparently on the gallows .\nAnd I am afraid of what happens after the trap door is sprung .\nBecause division and discord are all around us now .\nI once thought Roe would expire in an irenic scene of reconciliation .\nNow I see that we are much more likely to have civil war .\nHow else to prognosticate when even the Supreme Court is attacking the Supreme Court ?\nDuring oral arguments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sotomayor wondered , out loud and on the record : \u201c Will this institution survive the stench that this creates in the public perception that the Constitution and its reading are just political acts ?\n\u201d Good question .\nThe knives are out , and it seems Roe will kick over many pillars of our system of government in its death throes .\nRoe has so rooted itself in the national psyche that ripping it up will dislodge 50 years of discord onto our battered republic .\nI was far too optimistic when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Planned Parenthoods and prayed for the killing to stop .\nI thought our holocaust could taper off and our nation could emerge from it looking ahead to a brighter future .\nThe reality is that Roe will not heal us as it ends .\nIt will pit us against one another like never before .\nThe American holocaust is not an aberration ; it has become part of our national character , whether we like it or not .\nRoe has insinuated itself into our national soul .\nRoe sought to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without quarter .\nRoe dissolved and demoralized and disfigured as it dismembered our brothers and sisters .\nAn analogy might help put our situation into perspective .\nImagine if the Nazis \u2019 Holocaust had not ended with the German defeat , but continued to this day .\nMany Germans would of course be working to stop the horrors , but even if those good Germans succeeded , what would be left when the gas chambers had been shut down ?\nWhat would be the meaning of Germany after decades of cruel and wanton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both those who supported the killing and those who fought to end it , except the fallout from the killing itself ?\nThe very meaning of Germany would have been changed , from a country to a killing field .\nYou can \u2019 t flip a switch and make Auschwitz into not-Auschwitz .\nSome evils mark a place forever .\nUnlike the Nazis \u2019 Holocaust , no one from the outside has come to stop our holocaust in red , white , and blue .\nThe meat grinder has cranked on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laugh at the killing .\nThe American holocaust is a punchline for many on the left .\nThe rest of us shake our heads and wince , but almost all of us have found some way to live our lives around the engine of death turning and turning at the heart of our nation .\nAnd so , now we face a similar situation today to the one I have darkly imagined above .\nAfter five decades of malicious murder , the United States is Roe now .\nAnd we will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carnage is subdued .\nThe poison has spread through the body politic .\nWe need to keep killing , for we can not imagine doing otherwise .\nOur nation may not be able to return to a time when holocaust was not the default mode of the central state .\nWe may have forgotten how to be human beings , after having taken , or acquiesced in the taking of , the lives of more than 63 million other human beings .\nWe are faced with a time beyond Roe , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not think we understand that Roe , as evil as it is , is what joins us to one another now .\nEvil corrupts everything .\nIt can not be contained .\nIt replaces good bonds with bad , replaces charity with fear .\nWhen Roe falls , and I do pray that it will , despite my fear of what comes next , the United States will disintegrate .\nConsider how , already , the apparent end of Roe is shaping up .\nIn the first moments of Roe \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the weeks and months ahead .\nThe leak of the Supreme Court decision draft portending Roe \u2019 s end was treachery , obviously designed to mobilize the left for the upcoming midterm elections and buy time for the culture of death to codify the American holocaust as federal law .\nIndeed , Senator Bernie Sanders and other Democrats responded to the leak by calling for the filibuster to be demolished so that Congress could legislate Roe \u2018 s federal guarantee of access to abortion .\nFrom the outset it is plain .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ us down with it .\nThe left will pull down the halls of justice so that the central injustice of Roe can yet reign .\nConsider that the mechanism of Dobbs , if the majority decides as the leak suggests , will probably be to remand the abortion question to the several states .\nMany states already have in place laws that will automatically outlaw abortion , with at most rare exceptions , the moment Roe is struck down .\nOthers will enshrine , or already have , the right to abortion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be able to choose whether to live in a state that protects women and children , or one that targets them .\nAnd we will get to make that choice , most likely , much sooner than we might think .\nRoe was nationwide , so we were all stuck with one bad situation .\nRoe , ironically , has been a unifier of a kind , a sort of political principle , as distasteful as it is .\nAfter the downfall of Roe , we will not have this twisted unifier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro-choice .\nWe will have to make a decision , obscured from us now by the blanket nature of Roe v. Wade , Doe v. Bolton , Planned Parenthood v. Casey , and other culture-of-death rulings , about how we move forward as Americans .\nWe will be able to choose ; we will have to do so .\n\u201c Consider that I have set before thee this day life and good , and on the other hand death and evil , \u201d counsels the Good Book .\nIf we are pro-lifers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn by our consciences and our acquaintances to the living half of the continental divide .\nWe will become two nations .\nWe already are and long have been , yes .\nBut that rift will become manifest post-Dobbs , and there will be no bridging it and no turning back .\nThere is perhaps one way to avoid the coming national mitosis , however .\nWe can assemble , posthaste , a truth and reconciliation commission to reckon as best we can with this American holocaust .\nWe can have those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have benefited from and applauded it , sit before a tribunal and unburden their souls .\nWe can choose , as a nation , to forgive and to make amends for the 50 years of depraved violence visited on the preborn .\nThis is a choice we can make that could prevent us all , reeling from the trauma of the American holocaust , going our separate ways .\nBut I wonder if such an endeavor will suffice .\nTruth and reconciliation commissions have done good work in Rwanda , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chile , in South Africa , in Sierra Leone .\nBut the scale of the killing in these cases is dwarfed by our homegrown slaughter .\nWe had a communist-led truth and reconciliation commission to help us overcome the 1979 Greensboro Massacre , a rampage by the American Nazi Party and the Ku Klux Klan .\nBut the Greensboro Massacre tallied only five victims .\nThe American holocaust is more than 12 million times that figure .\nHow long will our post-Roe truth and reconciliation commission go on ?\nWill we set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 63 million victims of our half-century of federally approved , federally funded in utero lynching ?\nCan we continue to live in a country so overshadowed by its evil past ?\nIs there time enough , or forgiveness enough , left to our republic to work through and beyond the evil that has been done ?\nI used to think that the demise of Roe would be morning in America .\nThe dark night of death would be behind us , and we could learn to love one another again and move on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Roe as the evening , not the dawn .\nA continental divide is fast approaching .\nWhen Roe falls , we will finally , I believe , have to part , the proud culture-of-death Americans on one side , and the remorseful , sorrowing , bereaved , but faintly

progressive activists pushed Disney to speak out against Florida \u2019 s new education law , conservatives turned new ire on the Mouse .\nOf course , conservatives irate at a company that declares itself against them is nothing new ; what was new this time around was the fact that somebody with power did something about it , and inflicted an actual material loss on Disney .\nThe Florida legislature passed a bill stripping Disney of the special-district status that provided them extraordinary powers over their property in Florida , and Governor Ron DeSantis signed it .\nSome establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Florida \u2019 s ending a market distortion by curtailing special treatment for a particular corporation is the sort of thing conservatives generally support .\nDisney \u2019 s lawyers , for their part , countered that Florida law did not allow Florida to do such a thing .\nMost of the rest of us , unaccustomed to legislators actually doing something to stand up for the power of their voters , saw it as a refreshing win .\nFor those of us who like winning , there are other factors to consider .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all time , so if we want to win bigly , we have to make wins that lead to other wins .\nInspiring examples aren \u2019 t always broadly reproducible .\nSo , as always , we need to look in the mirror and see what we can learn .\nRighties tend to be punitive rather than coercive .\nAnd Righties are impatient : If somebody hits us , we want to hit back , and we want to hit back right now .\nThe challenge is making a hit against one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An ability to exploit unique vulnerabilities doesn \u2019 t always translate to being perceived as having general strength , because unique vulnerabilities are , well , unique ; not everyone will be vulnerable in the same way .\nWhen Delta caved to gun-control activists and ended a minor deal for NRA members , for example , backlash from NRA members and allied legislators cost Delta a $ 40 million tax break .\nBut that huge blow didn \u2019 t dissuade other corporations from caving to other lefty pressure campaigns , because few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were vulnerable at that particular time .\nOther corporations will have privileges that they \u2019 re loath to lose .\nBut each one will have different privileges , and if you want to go after them you have to know what and where they are .\nStanding up to corporations requires research , and our politicians are lazy and the grassroots lack the training and infrastructure .\nAnd then there \u2019 s the real downside of punitive actions : You \u2019 re punching the guy who clocked you on the chin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the chin .\nAnd the other guy may not even learn better from the experience .\nThen what ?\nWhat Lefties have that we on the right lack is a capacity for coercive action .\nUnlike punitive action , coercive action is forward-looking .\nThe goal is less punishing the enemy than changing the enemy \u2019 s behavior , making them do what you want and not what you don \u2019 t , without having to take one on the chin .\nIt is not about making threats ; you don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re going to do to your enemy and then tell your enemy what you \u2019 re going to do UNLESS .\nThat \u2019 s just telling your enemy the weak spots he needs to shore up .\nCoercive action isn \u2019 t about threatening the enemy ; it is about picking your targets and acting , putting pressure on your enemy to make them do what you want .\nSo how do Lefties do that , and why are we struggling to do it ?\nLeftist activists identify and target a company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s ability to materially operate is complicated or endangered until the company concedes .\nLike a lot of the stuff Lefties do , the skills involved come out of union organizing , and are sometimes used by unions as part of organizing campaigns .\nThe key principles are to stoke pressure with a creative mix of strategies and target organizations and individuals at multiple levels , such as a company itself , a key person in that company , and a key client of that company .\nHow do they do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a company has three targets : money , business , and reputation\u2014not just directed at the company , also at the owners , and the company \u2019 s allies and friends .\n\u201c Money \u201d is about where the money comes from : their relationships with banks , their shareholders and other investors , their commercial world ( suppliers , competitors , customers ) , plans for growth , and the like .\n\u201c Business \u201d is about how the company is organized , their workforce , and the legal environment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about the social campaign ; leftist activists weaponize as many allies as possible to target a company \u2019 s reputation .\nThe first question in launching a pressure campaign is : What do you want ?\nThe second question is : Who has the power to give it to you ?\nThe third question is : To what kind of pressure will that person respond ?\nAnswering the first question requires introspection .\nAnswering the second requires researching enemy organizations .\nAnswering the third requires analyzing key people within those organizations .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillips put it in a way you will see ecosocialists quote a lot : \u201c The planet is not dying ; it is being killed , and those who are killing it have names and addresses.\n\u201d This sounds threatening , but here \u2019 s what it means : Big faceless organizations are made up of real people .\nAnd real people have wants and needs , and you can apply pressure to them if you find out what those wants and needs are .\nThose people aren \u2019 t just the CEO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers , people in key positions and leadership roles , people who run individual company offices , political figures , and other institutions with which these people are affiliated .\nThe strategic researcher \u2019 s job is to collect information about these : where they live , what their contact information is , what they \u2019 re into , who their friends are .\nFind out who has the power , what their resources are , what their current motivations are .\nThen find out what kind of levers will work on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can \u2019 t directly target the person whose mind you \u2019 re hoping to change\u2026 but they have relationships with other people and organizations , and maybe you can effectively target one of those .\nOr more than one ; it \u2019 ll probably take a lot , depending on what you want and how inclined the other person is to give it to you .\nLefties call this kind of analysis power mapping .\nIt \u2019 s basically an amplification of a technique used in union-organizing .\nA union organizer maps his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , who the important figures to talk to are .\nA strategic researcher planning a corporate campaign maps social networks .\nThe organizer Lisa Fithian discusses the steps she uses for power mapping social networks in her memoir Shut it Down : Fithian provides a further breakdown of the quadrants she uses to sort her secondary ( and , iterating the mapping process out another level , tertiary ) targets .\nThe social quadrant includes \u201c clubs , \u201d \u201c news , \u201d \u201c civic groups , \u201d and \u201c media-social \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d \u201c school , \u201d \u201c neighborhood , \u201d and \u201c family \u201d ; the economic quadrant includes \u201c industry groups , \u201d \u201c other boards \u201d ( i.e.\n, of cultural or community groups ) , \u201c investments , \u201d and \u201c work \u201d ; the political quadrant includes the federal , state , and city levels , as well as political parties .\nHaving identified opportunities to strike , the next step is researching each one .\nWhat are the likely and possible consequences , for your opponents and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawbacks of each ?\nHow should each be timed to be effective and preserve a feeling of escalation ?\nHow can you best engage your people as you land these strikes ?\nYou \u2019 re not out to give one punch , you \u2019 re out to give a bunch of them , and you want the punches to get worse for your target .\nYou \u2019 re not just trying to make a big fuss that everyone will notice , you \u2019 re using a researched , planned , escalating strategic campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand the battle-space , you have to consider whether your campaign is likely to work .\nIn her book No Shortcuts : Organizing for Power in the New Guilded Age , hard-lefty organizer and strategist Jane McAlevey , building on the work of Joseph Luders , distinguishes two important factors in persuading an organization or individual to do something : concession cost and disruption cost .\n\u201c Concession cost \u201d means how much it will cost your enemy in money , effort , self-image , etc .\nto comply with your demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy it is for your movement to damage the target \u2019 s ability to do business as normal .\nMcAlevey points out that any movement wanting to achieve change needs to know both of these things going in , because they dictate how winnable your cause is and what approach you should take .\nA demand that is expensive or difficult to comply with requires a lot of pressure to win , and if you can \u2019 t bring the level of pressure necessary to win concessions you will spend energy without getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals also may be more susceptible to demands than others , and McAlevey points out that targeting these more pragmatic opponents historically has been a more successful approach for the labor movement than has charging at its biggest , strongest , most powerful , most hated , most adamantly opposed enemies .\nIn the early days of automotive unions , for example , organizing smaller manufacturers was a necessary stepping stone to conquering the company run by the staggeringly well-resourced and fervently anti-union Henry Ford .\nWhich brings us to the next question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate campaigns started ?\nAs you may have noticed from the brief summary above , planning and designing strategic campaigns is a hell of a lot of work .\nIt takes time to do thoroughly .\nIt doesn \u2019 t always pan out .\nThe bigger the target , the harder it is , and the more time it takes .\nAnd the people doing it still need to feed their families and keep the lights on .\nWhat this means in practice is that Lefty strategic research , especially on large and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with training , practice , and the support to do it for a living .\nMeaning , people who work in particular jobs at nonprofits or labor unions .\nRighties don \u2019 t have training in the skills , so don \u2019 t get practice , and building the infrastructure for it isn \u2019 t the kind of thing that the Righty grassroots think about or that Righty donors fund .\nBut we could change that , and it would be a welcome start .\nThere are some interesting fault lines on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLately nonprofits have been slurping up vast sums of donor dollars and attention , which is a bit grating if you \u2019 re the sort of person who believes in the mission of unions and wants mass-movement politics centered around labor .\nAnd Jane McAlevey has an interesting critique that puts a finger on the weak point of a lot of leftist organizing : If you \u2019 re interested in really changing society , then you need to create and grow mass movements .\nBut it \u2019 s a lot quicker and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already have by redistributing it for cheap effect ; the example McAlevey gives involves a union swelling a crowd on behalf of an organizing campaign by using people who are already members of other unions , rather than focusing on growing membership in the union they \u2019 re trying to build .\nA lot of leftist organizing projects power on the cheap , by giving the impression of being a mass movement without actually being one .\nIt trains people on the left to maximize their power , but also teaches them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their side than actually exists .\nIt depends on infrastructure , and that infrastructure can be targeted and disrupted .\nAnd if we build the necessary infrastructure on our side , Lefties \u2019 own analytical tools can be used to do it .\nDavid Hines has a professional background in international human-rights work with a focus on recovery from forced disappearances and mass homicide

States on September 12 , 2019 .\n( Photo by Yasin Ozturk/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images ) The Republican party in Tennessee has been put under the spotlight recently after it declined to approve three potential candidates for the 5th congressional district for the primary ballot , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tennessee Republican Party Chairman Scott Golden confirmed that Morgan Ortagus , Robby Starbuck , and Baxter Lee did not qualify to be candidates for the GOP nomination in the district , after a vote by a select committee of the State Executive Committee of the Tennessee Republican Party .\nMeanwhile , eyes in the district have turned to Maury County Mayor Andy Ogles and former Speaker of the Tennessee State House of Representatives Beth Harwell as the leading candidates in the race to the August 4 primary .\nOriginally from Norristown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixture in Tennessee politics since she first ran for public office in 1986 while teaching part time at Belmont University .\nWhile her first campaign to represent the Democratic district encompassing Nashville failed , she won election to the same state House seat two years later , in 1988 .\nShe would remain in the seat until 2018 .\nSince her first election to the Tennessee General Assembly , Harwell worked as the state co-chair for the John McCain presidential campaign in 2008 , was elected to serve as the first female speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 2018 , and in 2017 ran unsuccessfully in the Republican gubernatorial primary against now-Governor Bill Lee .\nShe also weighed a U.S. Senate race in 2006 .\nIn the 2012 presidential election , she endorsed Mitt Romney .\nIn an interview , Harwell said her experience in the legislature and her background in education make her the most qualified candidate for the 5th congressional district .\n\u201c I have a working knowledge of the legislative process from my time in the general assembly .\nI know procedure , which would be beneficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Conservative .\n\u201c I \u2019 m also a teacher , that \u2019 s my first passion , and I have a strong knowledge of our nation \u2019 s history , and I think that \u2019 s a distinction between myself and my opponent \u201d \u2014Ogles , that is .\nIn the Tennessee General Assembly , Harwell focused on welfare reform , crime , tax cuts , and education .\nShe is also on the record in favor of legalizing medical marijuana in Tennessee .\n\u201c When I was in the general assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers that did a good job , and that improved our public school system , \u201d said Harwell , who called herself \u201c a proud product of the public schools.\n\u201d While she believes Covid has set the state back about two years in terms of education improvement , she said she supports Governor Lee \u2019 s initiative with Hillsdale College to back 50 new charter schools in the state .\nShe was a vocal opponent of the Common Core curriculum and pushed for legislation which allowed more students to attend charter schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as parents have for their children is a good thing , \u201d she said .\n\u201c When most of the country was shutting down and mandates were being enforced , I refused to comply on behalf of the more than 100,000 residents of Maury County , on behalf of their freedom , \u201d Ogles told The American Conservative .\nImmediately south of Ogles \u2019 birthplace of Williamson County , Maury and most of Williamson are included in the newly redrawn 5th district , along with Lewis , Marshall , half of Wilson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply blue Davidson county , which encompasses Nashville .\nUnder Ogles \u2019 leadership , Maury was one of only a handful of Tennessee counties which did not mandate masking indoors in the spring of 2020 , when Governor Bill Lee encouraged but did not require Tennessee counties to do so .\nWilliamson , which prides itself on being one of the most conservative counties in the nation , did mandate indoor masking that spring .\nLast fall , Ogles campaigned for hospital employees in Maury to be given religious exemptions from employer-enforced vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c They have allowed religious exemptions because I joined the fight , \u201d Ogles said .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not anti-mask , I \u2019 m not anti-vaccine , but I am pro-freedom , in a time when the governments and states have lost their ever-loving mind .\nThis is a free country .\nOSHA and these other agencies are out of control , and Congress needs to rein them in .\nAny power that is not enumerated in the Constitution for the federal government should be returned to the states.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ogles said he travelled the state of Tennessee to encourage other mayors and county officials to follow his lead .\nDespite receiving death threats for his stance , according to Ogles , he said \u201c courage is contagious , \u201d and his work in Maury had a ripple effect across the state as other mayors and local officials stood up against further Covid-19 mandates .\n\u201c It was the right thing to do and I stood in the gap and I did it and I never looked back.\n\u201d Ogles said this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other candidates .\n\u201c When you look at everyone in the race , over the last two years , I was the only one who stood up and fought , \u201d Ogles said .\n\u201c I refused to shut down Maury County .\nWe had our county fairs , plural .\nWe had our concerts .\nEvery worker was essential .\nSo I have a proven track record .\nThere are going to be a lot of people in this race who talk about fighting against government , yet none of them have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing to say it , it \u2019 s another thing to do it , and I \u2019 ve been doing it under pressure.\n\u201d The three would-be candidates failed to receive approval from the party committee on the April 9 deadline due to challenges to their status as bona fide Republicans .\nThe Tennessee Republican Party bylaws define this qualification for candidacy as \u201c any individual who is actively involved in the Tennessee Republican Party , his County Republican Party , or any recognized auxiliary\u2026resides and is registered to vote in said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least three ( 3 ) of the four ( 4 ) most recent Statewide Republican primary elections ; or\u2026who is vouched for in writing ( to the satisfaction of the decision makers defined herein ) as a bona fide Republican.\n\u201d The bylaws also note that the political committee which decides a candidate \u2019 s eligibility \u201c may require additional verification that said individual is indeed a bona fide Republican.\n\u201d Ortagus , who registered to vote in Tennessee in November 2021 , has never voted in a Tennessee election .\nStarbuck had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the state prior to April 2022 , though he registered to vote in Tennessee in July 2019 , the same year he moved to the state from California .\nLee voted in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary .\nOrtagus , Starbuck , and Lee each had seven days to appeal the decision before the State Executive Committee ( SEC ) sent its final list of qualified candidates to the Tennessee Secretary of State on April 21 .\nOn April 19 , a 17 member committee of the SEC denied those appeals .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ members voted to reject Starbuck and Ortagus in their respective votes , while 10 voted to reject Lee .\n\u201c Every other public office in Tennessee has some sort of residency requirement , \u201d Ogles said , explaining as an example that despite having been born , raised , married , and had his kids in Williamson County , he would have to move back to the county and reside in it in order to run for county mayor there .\n\u201c There \u2019 s precedent for this in Tennessee.\n\u201d Many in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the state legislature \u2019 s recent law requiring U.S. House candidates to have lived in the state and county they hope to represent for three years prior to their election .\nOgles said there is precedent , at the least , for parties choosing who is and is not on their ballot .\n\u201c You may have an opinion as to if these folks should have been removed , but there is precedent for it , \u201d he said .\n\u201c It was the SEC \u2019 s decision , I didn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them about it , \u201d she said .\n\u201c I frankly think they just followed their bylaws .\nThis is not the first time this has happened.\n\u201d Shortly after the SEC \u2019 s decision , Republican state senator Frank Niceley implied Ortagus \u2019 s Trump

Curtiss-Wright , \u201c the powers of external sovereignty did not depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d In other words , the executive power to make international agreements would exist regardless of whether that authority was expressly mentioned in the Constitution .\nThe explicit mention of the Senate and its advice and consent function serves as an exception to what would otherwise be an exclusive executive power .\nSince the Constitution does not expressly make a similar exception for treaty termination , withdrawal remains an executive power of the president .\nThe relation of the Senate to the executive is similar in another place in the Constitution : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court settled the long-standing question of whether a president may remove executive officers without the approval of the Senate .\nAndrew Johnson was impeached for violating the Tenure in Office Act , which forbade the president to remove executive-branch officials without the consent of the Senate .\nBut , decades later in the case of Myers v. United States , the Supreme Court found that the executive power includes , in the absence of express words , a presidential power to unilaterally remove executive officers .\nThe Supreme Court \u2019 s analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myers is analogous to the treaty-making power .\nIn Myers , the Supreme Court noted that , in the Constitution , \u201c the executive power was given in general terms\u2026and was limited by direct expressions where limitation was needed , and the fact that no express limit was placed on the power of removal by the Executive was convincing indication that none was intended.\n\u201d The Court also stated that the advice and consent role of the Senate regarding appointments is meant \u201c to prevent the filling of offices with bad or incompetent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held that the purpose of advice and consent was not prompted by any desire to limit removals .\nIn sum , the Supreme Court found that \u201c the power of removal is incident to the power of appointment , not to the power of advising and consenting to appointments \u201d and that the executive is entrusted with the exclusive power of removal .\nSimilarly , as legal scholars Saikrishna Prakash and Michael Ramsey argue , the president \u2019 s executive power includes a general power over foreign affairs , and where the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Congress or the Senate , those powers reside with the president .\nIn other words , treaty termination is an exercise of the executive power of the president over foreign affairs .\nAlthough this was not always the case , unilateral presidential treaty withdrawal is now a reasonably settled matter of historical practice .\nTreaty termination is not all that rare , and out of the over 100 treaty terminations during the 20th and 21st centuries , almost all were effectuated by presidents who acted alone .\nWhen Congress attempted to constrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaties , it failed .\nThe most prominent example arose when President Carter decided to withdraw the United States from a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan .\nMembers of Congress , led by Senator Barry Goldwater , challenged Carter \u2019 s action in court but lost in the D.C .\nCircuit , which held that \u201c the President \u2019 s authority\u2026is at its zenith when the Senate has consented to a treaty that expressly provides for termination on one year \u2019 s notice , and the President \u2019 s action is giving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court has not definitively ruled on the question , we are left with the reality that when presidents exercise their executive power to withdraw from treaties , Congress is typically unable to mount a serious challenge .\nWhile we may not have a Supreme Court ruling directly on point , historic practice and a consistent reading of the executive power would confirm what the Founders provided : The president may unilaterally withdraw the United States from treaties .\nSenator Kaine \u2019 s resolution seeks

.\nIn just the latest example of the Biden administration riding roughshod over existing U.S. immigration law , the Department of Homeland Security recently announced it would grant 100,000 Ukrainians \u201c public interest parole \u201d admissions into the United States .\nWe all have deep sympathy for Ukrainian victims of Putin \u2019 s aggression , but Biden \u2019 s DHS , blowing past legal limitations set in current visa and refugee law , has arrogated to itself an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugee , from anywhere at any time .\nThis is not the rule of law .\nGranting admission to our country to foreign nationals , much like appropriating federal funds , is supposed to be a process tightly controlled by statute and congressional oversight .\nIt is ironic that the president will go to Congress to appeal for further funding to assist Ukraine , but his decision to admit Ukrainian migrants , regardless of its merits as a policy , will not be put to a vote on Capitol Hill .\nPresidents are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugee numbers and follow existing visa law .\nBut by twisting the original intent of public interest parole authority , Biden can snap his fingers and create a massive foreign admission program .\nThis is not the way the system is supposed to work .\nThe rationale behind Biden \u2019 s legal sleight of hand is embedded in the main U.S. migration law , Section 212 ( d ) ( 5 ) ( A ) of the Immigration and Nationality Act ( INA ) , which permits foreigners to be temporarily paroled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent was to restrict this extraordinary power to provisionally admit only single individuals who could not otherwise get a visa , on a case-by-case basis , for \u201c urgent humanitarian reasons \u201d including the need for medical treatment , or \u201c significant public benefit \u201d such as participation in a judicial hearing .\nCongress never expected this limited , exceptional parole authority to morph into vast fiat power for presidents to create massive refugee programs or entirely new visa categories by decree , without legislative approval .\nHowever , presidents of both parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest parole clause to get around the visa and refugee limits set by Congress .\nThe Biden administration is now surpassing all of its predecessors , turning parole into carte blanche authority to \u201c solve \u201d all migrant dilemmas , whether welcoming war refugees , creating new quasi-visa categories , or legalizing border jumpers .\nIn fact , Biden \u2019 s DHS has quietly used the parole mechanism to regularize more than 80,000 illegal entries on our chaotic southern border since October of last year .\nSeveral presidents before Biden , namely Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this sketchy legal authority to create their own patchwork of special admission programs : the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program ( launched by Clinton , formalized by Bush ) ; the Haitian Family Reunification Parole Program ( Obama ) ; Filipino World War II Veterans Parole Program ( Obama ) ; and Central American Minors Refugee and Parole Program ( Obama ) .\nThese programs have provided the equivalent of visa or refugee benefits never authorized by Congress to groups often tied to communities in the U.S. that the White House wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these programs never end , bringing in hundreds of thousands of migrants who successfully adjust their status to remain indefinitely in the country .\nNot surprisingly , congressional efforts to control this presidential abuse have fallen short .\nPresident Clinton initiated stretching this parole authority in the mid \u2019 90s to respond to a huge influx of Cuban rafters , a human maelstrom Castro manipulated to rid himself of regime opponents and pressure Washington .\nClinton understandably sought to avoid loss of life at sea , but instead of using stronger measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodated Castro \u2019 s blackmail and cut a deal to accept 20,000 Cuban migrants per year , made possible only by twisting parole authority into a special immigration quota for the island .\nThis Faustian bargain has continued for more than 25 years , bringing some 400,000 Cubans to the U.S. and ironically helping to prop up the island \u2019 s struggling regime .\nPresident Obama stretched this authority even further .\nIn addition to the programs already listed , Obama also conjured up the so-called \u201c International Entrepreneur \u201d parole in 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element , and claiming this parole brought a public benefit by inviting more foreigners to start businesses in the U.S .\nIn fact , a congressionally approved investor visa category already existed , but the Obama White House wanted more , and since Congress refused to act , it resorted to executive fiat to create an immigration program out of thin air .\nTo its credit , Donald Trump \u2019 s administration nixed Obama \u2019 s entrepreneur parole , while also trying to put an end to the Haitian , Central American , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not formally try to end the Cuban parole , but its implementation was hindered due to concerns about \u201c sonic attacks \u201d at the U.S. embassy in Havana .\nNot surprisingly , President Biden has now revived all of these programs that Trump tried to kill , and he is actively looking to expand them .\nBiden \u2019 s DHS recognizes few limits to using parole authority to legalize any migrant , either at the border or already in the country ( DHS invented \u201c parole in place \u201d to regularize undocumented migrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open-border advocates appear determined , with apparent Congressional acquiescence , to transform this Frankenstein parole authority into a powerful tool that can radically overturn the normal functioning of U.S. immigration and refugee and asylum law .\nBiden \u2019 s ability to restart these programs after Trump ended them demonstrates that only Congressional action to amend the INA can stop the abuse of parole authority .\nThe Trump experience proves that leaving this legal mess to be repaired by future conservatives in the executive branch is too risky .\nIn fact , even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with expanding parole authority to launch its own invented immigration program .\nIn the summer of 2018 , Ambassador Gordon Sondland , Trump \u2019 s envoy heading the U.S. Mission to the European Union ( USEU ) , announced that the president had tasked him with devising a \u201c European Immigration Plan.\n\u201d This was during the time when Trump was famously quoted as saying he wanted \u201c more immigrants from places like Norway.\n\u201d Sondland \u2019 s assignment was to engineer a new wave of European migration to America .\nI was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and the ambassador asked me to come up with details that would make such a plan feasible .\nPersonable and persuasive , Sondland explained that he and the president had discussed the value of renewing European interest in immigration to the United States .\nSondland believed that if a simplified , less bureaucratic immigration pathway could be designed , it could inspire significant numbers of ambitious Europeans to seek their future in the United States .\nI stressed to the ambassador that immigrant visa matters were statutory , exclusively the prerogative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fully aware of all the immigration chicanery during Obama \u2019 s eight years in the White House , knew there must be more options available for him to recommend to Trump , since the president had no intention of quixotically asking Congress to create a new visa category .\nThus , Sondland \u2019 s draft plan included the suggestion that the administration could resort , like its predecessor , to ramping up parole authority to bring in the sought-after European migrants .\nInside the State Department , Sondland \u2019 s draft plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something that Obama could use to advance his immigration policies , many bureaucrats doubtless believed , but in Trump \u2019 s hands it represented an unwarranted presidential power grab .\nTo their credit , some observers at State rightly advocated that the bureaucracy should work to limit , not expand , parole , which they thought the Obama administration had also improperly used to bypass Congress .\nMostly , however , Foggy Bottom condemned the Sondland plan because it was viewed as illegitimately favoring \u201c rich and white \u201d immigrants .\nSondland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present his plan , which despite State Department skepticism firmly recommended the use of parole to revitalize European migration .\nThe ambassador later said that the president had only cursorily considered the plan before giving it to Chief of Staff John Kelly to review , and to my knowledge , nothing again was ever heard of it .\nMore than anything , this anecdote illustrates why parole power , which has been distorted and expanded beyond recognition from its original congressional intent , must simply be taken away from the executive .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its current application is equivalent to giving a wrecking ball to open-border activists who would demolish all restraints at our frontiers .\nWhen conservatives in Congress have a majority , they must work to end parole authority as one of the highest priorities in tackling long overdue immigration reform .\nPhillip Linderman is a retired Foreign Service officer who

cooperation .\n( Photo by Luka Dakskobler/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images ) The war in Ukraine continues to draw our attention away from one of the biggest global news stories of our time : illegal migration .\nEurope is on the front lines of this mass migration into the West , but the changes will be so enormous that they will affect the United States as well .\nThe old continent is facing catastrophic change of the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will make Viktor Orb\u00e1n , Hungary \u2019 s right-wing prime minister , seem liberal in comparison .\nJ\u00e1nos Bats\u00e1nyi , a Hungarian poet famous in his own homeland , once wrote : \u201c Cast your watchful eyes on Paris !\n\u201d When it comes to Europe , American readers do well to pay attention not only to the news from Ukraine but to the borderlands of Europe as well .\nOf course , migration and immigration have always been present to some extent in the Western world and always will be .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ be immigration , but where migrants come from , whether they are young men only , and what cultural beliefs they will bring with them .\nEven mere discussion of the social changes brought about by migration triggers the liberal media in both the U.S. and Europe .\nThey see its mention as potential incitement to hatred , leading to horrific events such as the 2019 Christchurch massacre .\nThough all decent observers should be careful not to incite hatred , we would be fools to ignore the facts , which exist independently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The inconvenient facts of Europe \u2019 s migration crisis are these : First , the population of the MENA ( Middle East and North Africa ) region will see drastic growth in the coming decades .\nSecond , the MENA region is set to lose much of its drinking water and food sources .\nThird , advances in electric vehicles and renewable energy sources could soon rob the region of much of its GDP .\nAll of this will prompt millions of people from this region to leave for Europe .\nThe confluence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s cultural and political milieu , and will do so in a way that legitimizes hardline European politicians of the right .\nPut another way , if you don \u2019 t like Viktor Orb\u00e1n \u2019 s style of right-wing politics , wait till you see who comes after him .\nBefore we have a look at the influences behind the mass relocation of people today , let \u2019 s try and imagine how such a huge wave of migration would take place .\nAlthough the last such event in Europe happened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little earlier , in 2014 .\nBy that time , one million Syrians had left their war-torn country and more than 600,000 had applied for asylum in the E.U .\nThe Syrian civil war began in 2011 , so realistically , three to four years after a more serious cataclysm , a migration crisis could develop in Europe .\nThe immediate reaction of some highly conservative , nationalist countries , such as Hungary , was to close the borders in 2015 .\nHowever , countries with liberal or moderate conservative leadership immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and invited the masses to Europe .\nWe can remember the slogan of the then conservative German Chancellor Angela Merkel : \u201c Wir schaffen das , \u201d meaning \u201c we will solve it !\n\u201d It seems unlikely that the elite controlled by Brussels would react differently in the event of another crisis .\nContrary to Merkel \u2019 s slogan , the E.U .\nhas not even solved the integration of one million people .\nToday we can safely say that Merkel \u2019 s immigration policy has been a complete failure .\nWhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foreigners in Germany were unemployed ( that \u2019 s more than a million people ) , 65 percent of Syrians were unable to make a living in Germany and were therefore weighing down the social system .\nCrime statistics do not show any better data either .\nIn 2019 , non-German citizens committed 35 percent of crimes in Germany .\nIt is worth highlighting again the role of the Syrians : In the same year , Syrians were responsible for 12.2 percent of violent crimes .\nAnd although refugees make up only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population , in 2018 , for example , 12 percent of all sexual crimes were committed by refugees .\nNegative social changes like this do not go unnoticed by the European masses .\nImmigration is fundamentally viewed negatively by people around the world , and especially in Europe .\nIn countries where the negative effects of migration can be openly discussed , such as Hungary , Poland , or the Czech Republic , a significant proportion of the population rejects migration .\nA recent survey looked at the question of whether , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member states , 70 million migrants could be successfully integrated into Europe in the coming years .\nThe responses were staggering : It was not only Eastern European countries who found this scenario completely unrealistic , but even the more liberal German , French , Dutch , Swedish , and Flemish societies .\nYet the number of 70 million is still a relatively low estimate .\nIncidentally , according to Eurobarometer , in 2018-2019 , the European population was concerned about migration above all else .\nIt is not difficult to imagine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more about the topic of migration .\nThe migration crisis of 2015 shook the continent , eliminating parties in the long run ( think of the German CDU ) and elevating parties ( think of the further strengthening of Fidesz in Hungary after 2015 ) .\nWe have not even talked about the rise of terrorism .\nAs is well known , several perpetrators of the attack on the Bataclan and other caf\u00e9s in Paris on November 13 , 2015 , entered Europe during the wave of migration with false documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still unknown .\nAlthough many people do not remember this because of the Covid-19 pandemic , in March 2020 another migration crisis unfolded on the Turkish-Greek border .\nThe Turkish side accused the Greek border guards of using live ammunition , which Greece denied .\nBut let us be honest , by 2050 , they will certainly be using live ammunition .\nAnd mass migration will not only be a burden upon Southern Europe .\nLast November , the Polish border guards fought off masses of Arab migrants on the Polish-Belarusian border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and water cannons .\nMuslim masses last attempted to occupy these areas in the 17th century .\nEurope \u2019 s borders are slowly becoming a zone besieged by illegal immigrants from all directions .\nHow long will European politicians be able to hold back the far right ?\nBy \u201c far right , \u201d I do not mean people who want to defend their homeland and their borders , but people who want to shoot with live ammunition people who look different , and whose coming to power can only bring suffering to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians and Muslims .\nThey will not be the far right of the Budapest kind , but of the Christchurch kind .\nWhat can we expect in the future ?\nAccording to conservative U.N. projections , the region \u2019 s population could grow to one billion between 2020 and 2050 , an increase of 400 million over the next 30 years .\nLet us not forget that with this calculation we have not even mentioned all the other countries in the world that do not belong to the MENA region , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Central and East Asia .\nOne of the most dramatic effects of climate change will undoubtedly be a shortage of drinking water .\nAccording to the U.N. definition , \u201c when a territory withdraws 25 per cent or more of its renewable freshwater resources it is said to be \u2018 water-stressed \u2019 .\n\u201d According to a March 2022 study by Statista , the water stress level will be highest in the region we are discussing by 2040 ( above 80 percent ) .\nBut we may not have to wait that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pew , \u201c the world \u2019 s\u2026dry areas are getting drier much more quickly than previously thought.\n\u201d For example , in Iran , \u201c per capita water availability is set to fall by 50 percent by 2050.\n\u201d Why is the issue of water so important ?\nThe New Security Beat blog , maintained by the Wilson Center , explains : \u201c Decreased water availability can be the principal cause of civil unrest and localized violence\u2026 .\nWater stress can be exploited by non-state actors , violent extremist organizations , insurgents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and widespread occasions of civil unrest and localized violence , with a greater sense of urgency to change perceived governmental inadequacies.\n\u201d The increase in war and terrorism will inevitably increase the willingness to migrate , as we saw in 2015 for Syria .\nThose who pay attention not only to the daily news of the Russo-Ukrainian war , but also to the broader studies , may not be surprised to hear this : the war has already shaken the world \u2019 s food supply , and we are still at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be cumulatively true for the MENA region .\nAccording to Niels Graham and Inbar Pe \u2019 er of the GeoEconomics Center : \u201c Together , Russia and Ukraine account for nearly a third of global wheat exports .\nHowever , following Russia \u2019 s attack on its neighbor , both vital supply chains have been crippled .\nThe war will impact global grain markets now acutely in the MENA region , with possibly devastating economic and political ripple effects.\n\u201d What does this mean in practice ?\nFor example , Iran is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world .\nThe country was already struggling with grain shortages due to the drought in 2021 , so a huge number of imports were expected for the 2021/2022 marketing year .\nThe country is projected to need 5 million tons of grain this year , making it the fifth largest grain importer in the world , just behind Egypt .\nHowever , the huge demand will certainly remain unmet .\nUkraine and Russia account for more than a quarter of global wheat exports and nearly a fifth of corn .\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore remain bereft of sources .\nAccording to Tam\u00e1s Dezs\u0151 , the phenomenon of the spread of electric cars can not be ignored either when considering the future of the MENA region .\nWhile we can \u2019 t fully predict changes in oil production , both Bloomberg and J. P. Morgan \u2019 s predictions suggest that electric cars could account for half or more of the global car fleet by 2050 .\nIt is therefore logical to conclude that the crude oil-producing countries in the region in question , whose GDP largely relies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market demand .\nThis could lead to a massive loss of income and unemployment .\nIn 2018 , for example , according to the World Bank , oil rents accounted for 20 percent of Iran \u2019 s GDP , 43 percent in Libya , 39 percent in Iraq , and 21 percent in Syria .\nAccording to a 2018 Gallup survey , 24 percent of the population in the MENA region wanted to emigrate in 2017 .\nThe numbers have only grown since then .\nAccording to an article in December 2021 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 33 percent , but this was typical of the entire Arab world : two out of five young Arabs want to leave their homeland , and in some countries such as Lebanon , Libya , Yemen , and Iraq even two-thirds of young men .\nIn what direction will these masses leave the MENA region ?\nThey can not go to Southern Africa precisely because of climate change , destabilization , and war .\nIn the Sub-Saharan region , according to a Gallup survey just quoted , 33 percent of the locals were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years ago .\nRussia , India , and China will not let these masses in , as these countries are not very famous for their liberal immigration policies anyway , and India and China are overpopulated even today .\nIt makes sense that these masses will head for Europe , if only because the liberal elite in Brussels has not learned from the 2015 crisis and continues to make inviting , inclusive statements , which are regularly covered by the Arabic-language media .\nFrom this , the masses draw the simple conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace , water , food , and work , here we welcome you !\nWhy are the liberal Brusselites interested in fostering mass migration to Europe ?\nHow can they not see the social unrest and dangerous developments their actions ferment ?\nThe answer is most likely that they can see it , but they do not care .\nThe European liberal elite has decided that the merits of turning the Old Continent into \u201c Terra Nova \u201d , the New Land for the New Europeans outweighs the downsides .\nMost of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feat that is becoming increasingly difficult for left-wing and liberal parties in Western Europe , at least without the Muslim vote .\nAs the European right turns its attention more and more to the woes of the classical working class , so does the left concentrate more and more on the social situation and rights of the migrant masses .\nAnd the migrant masses do know how to say thank you .\nIn the United Kingdom , 85 percent of Muslims voted on the Labour Party at the 2017 parliamentary elections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 2005 and 2015 as well .\nThe British \u201c Vote Smart \u201d movement , supported by Muslim news portals and the Muslim Council of Britain , has focused on calculating the maximum number of council mandates attainable based on the Muslim population and encouraging strategic voting .\nAmong British Muslim councilors , left-wingers were strongly overrepresented during the last two local elections .\nThe European left is becoming more Muslim while the Muslims of Europe are becoming more left-wing .\nSurveys in two other Western European countries with a large immigrant community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belgian regional elections , 45.7 percent of the Muslims eligible for voting supported the Socialists , 13.3 percent the Liberals , and only 7.1 percent the Christian Democrats .\nDuring the 2007 parliamentary elections , 42.3 percent of Muslims voted for the Socialists , 16.7 percent for Christian Democrats , 14.7 percent for Liberals , and 12.2 percent for the Greens .\nIn France , during the 2007 French presidential elections , in the \ufb01rst round , 64 percent of Muslim voters voted for socialist candidate S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal , 19 percent for center-right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for right-wing candidate Nicolas Sarkozy .\nIn the second round , 95 percent of Muslim voters supported Royal \u2019 s camp .\nJust a few days before writing , a similar result occurred .\nSome 69 percent of the French Muslim population voted for Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon in the first round of the 2022 French presidential election .\nBehind him , second was Liberal Emmanuel Macron with 14 percent , and third with Marine Le Pen on the right with 7 percent of the Muslim vote .\nM\u00e9lenchon performed best in Muslim-populated neighborhoods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France called for supporting Macron before the second round .\nThe growing Muslim population in Europe will , of course , demand a voice in politics over time , as we can already see in the case of the British Labor Party or the immigrant party DENK in the Netherlands and in the case of the United States ( think of Ilhan Omar ) .\nThe script described by Michel Houellebecq in his book Submission does not seem so detached from reality : One day , Western or Northern European countries may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not entirely , by individuals with an immigrant background .\nIn today \u2019 s globalized world , America can not escape the same troubles .\nT.S .\nEliot rightly pointed out that the main problem with liberalism is that it contributes to the dismantling of the very liberties that had helped bring it about in the first place .\nBrussels is making the same mistake today : It is persecuting the Hungarian right and its migration policy by referring to it as \u201c far right , \u201d and not seeing the reality that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hungary \u2019 s position soon by 2050 the continent will face a real far right .\nThe day will come when we will think of Viktor Orb\u00e1n as a moderate , liberal politician , and

grenades at its opponents , calling those in its crosshairs racists , sexists , or bigots , often with professional consequences for the recipients of their incendiary attacks .\nSometimes they employed clinical or therapeutic language to give their insults a patina of professional respectability , thus the imaginary terms \u201c homophobia , \u201d \u201c transphobia , \u201d and \u201c Islamophobia.\n\u201d But now they \u2019 re the groomers .\nAnd boy , do they not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges \u201c baseless \u201d and \u201c unfounded.\n\u201d They \u2019 ve tried to dismiss the

\u2019 ve doxxed journalists who have uncovered the pervasity of the perversity .\nThey \u2019 ve even tried to argue , bizarrely , that conservatives would have called Jesus a groomer .\nAnd yet for all the sputtering , the groomer charge seems to be sticking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a catastrophic midterm election for the Democratic Party .\nIt raises an interesting question : Are ad hominems ever justified ?\nFor the ad hominem is a logical fallacy .\nInstead of addressing someone \u2019 s argument or position , one person attacks the other person who is making the argument .\nThus , for example , you offer an argument for the existence of God .\nI counter : \u201c Well , of course you \u2019 d say that ; you \u2019 re a Christian.\n\u201d The argument has not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple ?\nThere are examples aplenty for when a person \u2019 s character hurts his argument .\nA politician elected on defending family values , only to be uncovered as a philanderer , has seriously undermined his credibility and by extension his argument that family values matter .\nAnother politician who urges tight restrictions during a pandemic to \u201c stop the spread \u201d only to flagrantly violate those restrictions risks no longer being taken seriously .\nAnd celebrities who demand aggressive , sacrificial steps to combat climate change but fly around the globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of \u201c rules for thee but not for me.\n\u201d Of course , hypocritical deeds alone don \u2019 t disprove an argument .\nBut they certainly don \u2019 t help .\nThe same can be said for anyone whose character or actions welcome censure .\nIt is harder to respect your interlocutor or his arguments when you are aware of an egregious moral failing .\nYou might at this point acknowledge that hypocrisy and wickedness make a person less credible .\nBut , you might counter , that doesn \u2019 t mean a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a debate .\nWhy not just focus on the actual arguments and evaluate them on their own strength , carefully considering the evidence ?\nAren \u2019 t ad hominems needless distractions , if not often unjust character assassinations ?\nThis is what Ephraim Radner argues in a recent piece at First Things .\n\u201c We should take more seriously the pernicious role of ridicule in our common life , not to mention in our personal behavior , \u201d he writes .\nHe cites the example of Germaine de Sta\u00ebl ( 1766\u20131817 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descended into the personal , trading in vicious rumors and finally painting her as ugly , boorish , crude , and sexually repellant.\n\u201d Most cruelly , argues Radner , those attacks weren \u2019 t even true , and had a damaging effect on the French intellectual \u2019 s reputation .\nAd hominems certainly can be cruel and unjust .\nThey are often a diversionary tactic , obscuring bad arguments as the crowd is drawn away from the hard work of intellectual analysis and towards the sensational and provocative .\nYet not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to destroy or distract .\nSometimes they can even be part of the argument itself , or a means of emphasizing the problem with your interlocutor \u2019 s argument .\nMany of the greatest rhetoricians in the Western tradition have made effective use of the ad hominem .\nThe great British politician and orator Winston Churchill jokingly referred to Labor Prime Minister Clement Attlee as \u201c a modest man , who has much to be modest about.\n\u201d More seriously , Churchhill in the 1930s called the Nazis \u201c ruthless men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride , unrestrained by law , by parliament , or by public opinion , \u201d and referred to communists in the post-war era as \u201c wicked men.\n\u201d Part of what was evil about fascists was not just their ideology , but them .\nIn our own American tradition , Teddy Roosevelt once referred to one Supreme Court justice as \u201c an amiable old fuzzy-wuzzy with sweetbread brains , \u201d and another time called politician William Jennings Bryan \u201c a professional yodeler , a human trombone.\n\u201d More recently , Ronald Reagan once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal friends is not that they \u2019 re ignorant ; it \u2019 s just that they know so much that isn \u2019 t so.\n\u201d On another occasion he joked : \u201c A hippie is someone who looks like Tarzan , walks like Jane , and smells like Cheetah.\n\u201d Of course , some of the above are a bit more biting than the rest .\nBut there are some general rules we can discern , ones that Hillsdale College Professor Matt Mehan in his reflections on the great rhetorician Thomas More has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad hominems .\nFirst , they should originate in charity , not hatred .\nThose stemming from hate undermines republican government by vitiating the neighborliness and public trust required for civic collaboration .\nThose done in love , and ideally gentleness , exposes latent , or not-so-latent , problems with the argument and the person making them , especially when the two are interrelated .\nSecondly , if an ad hominem is to be lodged , it must actually be true and verifiable .\nOtherwise the wielder of the weapon does so in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis would be in opposition to the cardinal virtue of justice , which gives to each his proper due .\nIt is for this reason that liberal ad hominems that tag conservatives as guilty of transphobia or bigotry typically fail .\nIt \u2019 s also often the case that many of them are made with obvious malice .\nLet \u2019 s return to groomer .\nTo say that there are philosophical and scientific reasons to believe one can not change sex , and that doing so is an act of violence against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessarily motivated out of some irrational fear .\nRather , it may be a concern that those who do are at war with themselves , and are damaging not only their own personhood but broader society .\nSuch cases have been made by journalist Abigail Shrier in her recent book , Irreversible Damage , and Ryan T.

Nash , author ofThe Conservative Intellectual Movement in America since 1945 to assess what Nash characterizes as \u201c the current intellectual drama on the right.\n\u201d Since the Acton Institute just reposted this essay , it may be timely to ponder Nash \u2019 s perspective .\nIn his judgment , \u201c there will be no clearcut restoration of the Reaganite paradigm or the fusionist status quo that existed before 2016.\n\u201d Rather the future will see \u201c an attempt by mainstream conservative figures to refurbish the house of conservatism with a certain amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proprietor of the house.\n\u201d This incorporation of alien elements must be done carefully but may also be unavoidable if conservatism is to survive : \u201c Conservatives in the public arena will probably become somewhat less libertarian and anti-statist on economic and social policy and more anti-elitist as they try to nail down the working class vote at home and confront the economic and military threat from China.\n\u201d Nash believes that something of great worth is slipping away .\nIt is the conservative movement , as understood by this historian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with National Review under the stewardship of William F. Buckley and then culminated in the Reagan Revolution and the conservative initiatives that came out of Reagan \u2019 s presidency : \u201c From the perspective of a historian , this flowering of applied conservatism , this institutionalization of conservative discourse and advocacy is a remarkable and laudable development .\nSince the 1960s , what has been called a conservative parallel universe has arisen in America and it continues to expand .\nIt should not be cavalierly disparaged.\n\u201d As a historian who has written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservatism , but whose work has rattled \u201c Conservatism , Inc. , \u201d allow me to present a very different view .\nNash writes as a defender of the Conservative Movement , which is almost entirely distinct from the conservative movement , lower case .\nThese two entities have sometimes intersected but usually remained apart and often at war .\nIn the second edition of his magisterial work on American conservatism , which appeared in 1996 , Nash entitled his last chapter \u201c Can the Center Hold ?\n\u201d That chapter describes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then raging between a conservative movement already falling under neoconservative domination and their paleoconservative adversaries .\nIt is a no brainer who won that shootout , because of superior resources and more influential contacts .\nNot surprisingly , the paleos no longer merit Nash \u2019 s attention in his assessment of the right .\nNash may be treating this group as ousted heretics who stood in the way of the one sacred faith .\nHeretics are to be expelled , not put in the company of believers .\nMoreover , the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its doctrine , which is exactly how Nash depicts the Movement .\nSupposedly it has stood tall for the same principles and causes since its inception in the 1950s and has been occupying the same \u201c parallel universe \u201d in relation to the same left since the 1960s .\nIt was in response to the heretics that a gathering took place at New York \u2019 s Union Club on January 22,1990 , which brought together the Movement \u2019 s notables .\nAt that holy convocation , which included WFB , Norman Podhoretz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was learned that \u201c certain people were not invited because they attacked the people who were there.\n\u201d An \u201c Agenda for the Nineties \u201d that Buckley brought with him laid out detailed plans for how the Movement would develop in the coming decade .\nIntegral to this plan for growth was marginalizing paleoconservative troublemakers .\nThat was how the Movement in the 1990s dealt with dissent on the right .\nBut even then , it differed ideologically from what it had been in the 1960s .\nBack then the Movement , grouped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Civil Rights activists , including Martin Luther King , featured pro-Confederate contributors , and sometimes wrote scathingly about Israel .\nNational Review was founded in 1955 , as we learn from Nash \u2019 s own scholarship , by anti-Communist defenders of Senator Joe McCarthy , like WFB , Brent Bozell , Willi Schlamm , and Frank Meyer .\nThe Conservative Movement today is certainly well to the left of where it was in the 1960s on almost every social issue , just as Ronald Reagan was more sympathetic to the welfare state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taft and Barry Goldwater .\nWhat Nash is really celebrating is the \u201c institutionalization \u201d and expansion of the Movement , which is now far richer and enjoys more media outreach than it did 20 years ago .\nBut that does not mean the Movement has been promoting the same positions since the 1960s or that the fusionist combination of economic libertarianism and moral traditionalism that Nash recommends to us looks the same now as when Nash brought out the first edition of his history in 1976 .\nThere is another omission in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out .\nAlthough the Movement has become the most visible and most well-heeled opposition to a left that continues to move leftward , it hardly embraces all conservative resistance .\nThere is also a much looser conservative movement made up of a wide variety of r\u00e9sistants , many of them unacceptable to the Movement and in some cases consisting of those whom the Movement has purged .\nThese groups range from the so-called alt-right and neo-reactionaries to paleoconservatives and paleolibertarians .\nAt least some of these opponents of the left have rallied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more establishment conservatives of the Claremont Institute , The American Conservative , and First Things .\nThis degree of cooperation among authorized and non-authorized conservatives on behalf of an evolving populist cause may not be entirely to Nash \u2019 s liking .\nMost significantly , Nash understates the amount of conflict that has characterized the history of the Movement .\nPurges have not been a minor feature of that history but , as the contributors to The Vanishing Tradition contend , a defining feature .\nThe conservative coalition that Buckley forged came about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative traditions .\nThat coalition took shape partly because of Buckley \u2019 s removal of isolationist conservatives who rejected his Cold War bellicosity .\nIn the 1950s and 1960s , these purges occurred only occasionally and typically over the protracted struggle with world Communism .\nBut they took on a greater significance in later years .\nThis practice reached its apogee when the neoconservatives came to power in the 1980s and 1990s .\nThereafter driving away the undesirables became a common Movement practice .\nNash would have us believe that there was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservatism before the populist intruders began raising holy hell .\nWhat he conveniently leaves out of the Movement \u2019 s history are the purges and changing party lines .\nPerhaps even more relevant , some of those whom the Movement drove away then came back as a populist opposition .\nBy the way , Nash \u2019 s association of \u201c homeschooling networks \u201d and \u201c classical Christian academies \u201d with the Movement is not at all apparent to me .\nSuch enterprises would likely be operating through local and family initiatives even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutional presence .\nSuch communal and family activities prospered long before the Movement \u2019 s agglomeration of business and media interests came into existence .\nOf course , we may be sure that the Washington \u2019 s \u201c conservative foundation community \u201d want members of this \u201c vibrant counterculture \u201d to stress its interests and mirror its talking points .\nThe danger that Nash may fear is that the long-scorned movement may take revenge on his Movement .\nBut I doubt this will be a total victory because of a continuing imbalance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine replications of what happened in New York \u2019 s Union Club in 1990 , the Movement will follow Nash \u2019 s advice and try to coopt populism without Trump \u2019 s \u201c counterrevolutionary tone.\n\u201d The Movement people enjoy staggering media and financial resources .\nWe needn \u2019 t be surprised that members of that group got into Trump \u2019 s administration and influenced what was advertised as populist politics .\nFox News celebrities now marinate the public in populist slogans ; the very conventional Steve Hilton runs a populist program on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in a bowling shirt reeling off populist rhetoric , and although most of his guests are recycled Fox-personalities from other programs , they all sound like wannabe populists .\nPaul Gottfried is editor in chief of Chronicles : A Magazine of American Culture .\nHe is also the Raffensperger

by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images ) \u201c Republicans , the police union , and the ultra-wealthy are banding together \u201d to recall San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin according to the pro-Boudin group Stand With Chesa .\nI don \u2019 t fit into any of those categories , nor do a lot of the San Franciscans looking to dismiss Boudin for failing to enforce the law .\nThis recall effort raises a question that San Francisco voters , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , will have to settle .\nWhen prosecutors like Boudin refuse to enforce the law in defiance of their constitutional duties , will they be held accountable ?\nHere in California , Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta have fallen short of their constitutional duties by allowing prosecutors to wield undue discretion over the enforcement of the law .\nThe California constitution obligates the attorney general \u201c to see that the laws of the State are uniformly and adequately enforced.\n\u201d The governor has the responsibility to \u201c see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words of Zachary Price , a professor at the U.C .\nHastings College of Law , \u201c These provisions are at odds with presuming any categorical nonenforcement power at all , let alone one vested in locally elected officials.\n\u201d Yet , neither Newsom nor Bonta have stepped in to prevent prosecutors across the state from explicitly or implicitly refusing to enforce certain laws .\nThey \u2019 re not alone in failing to rein in lawless prosecutors .\nArkansas , Hawaii , Indiana , Maryland , Massachusetts , Nebraska , New Hampshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vermont , and West Virginia all have constitutions that , per Price , ban suspensions of law enforcement .\nFlorida and New Jersey , like California , charge state-level officials with an affirmative duty to ensure enforcement of the law .\nIn cities across these states , progressive prosecutors have tried to respond to understandable calls for criminal-justice reform .\nIn doing so , however , these prosecutors are leading their respective states into unconstitutional territory .\nCalifornia serves as a useful example .\nGiven that the people of California established the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of municipalities , Californians deserve to have a governor and attorney general who faithfully execute the existing law unless and until the people decide otherwise by amending their Constitution .\nNo prosecutor possesses the power to take the law into his hands and unilaterally decide that certain crimes are unworthy of enforcement .\nYet , the district attorney in Los Angeles , George Gasc\u00f3n , has stated that his office will not prosecute certain crimes .\nUpon taking office , Gascon told his prosecutors to decline charging 13 categories of low-level misdemeanors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and public intoxication .\nThis action flew in the face of the governor and attorney general \u2019 s constitutional mandates to enforce the law .\nHowever , Newsom and Bonta have sat on the sidelines and enabled power grabs by prosecutors .\nSimilarly , in San Francisco , District Attorney Boudin has effectively written some laws of the books .\nHis team dismissed 50 percent of cases of illegal gun possession from 2020 to 2022 .\nLikewise , of 131 arrests for felony domestic violence made by the San Francisco Police Department at @ @ @ @ @

the substantial growth of GOP support among working-class minorities and immigrants .\nIn something of a tell , this growth was often heralded in outlets normally quite hostile to the GOP and its interests .\n\u201c The GOP is really assembling the multiracial working-class coalition that the left has always dreamed of , \u201d said David Shor , a Democratic operative who was a leading Obama advisor .\nWhile the GOP should of course welcome an expanded electoral base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working-class-led GOP is a briar patch that the often-dimwitted GOP leadership should avoid .\nThat narrative presents two dangers to the party : First , that in its laudable efforts to reach out to minorities , the GOP will abandon or attack the legitimate interests of its existing , predominantly white , voter base ; and , second , that in focusing its efforts on building a working-class coalition , it will alienate the elites that it ultimately needs to win over to govern successfully .\nContra Shor , a multi-racial working-class coalition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s white and increasingly working-class base , would be completely incapable of exercising decisive political power , even if it won elections .\nTo change the GOP \u2019 s losing dynamic , the party must reach out to a portion of the hated elites , because without the support of some meaningful portion of those elites , it will be unable to effectively govern the modern American state , no matter how many elections it wins .\nThe dramatic recent moves by Elon Musk to take over Twitter and reopen it as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after years of legislative failure and largely fruitless grassroots organizing against big tech , shows the decisive power of elites in our politics .\nWhile the GOP should strive to be the party of middle- and working-class interests , it should do so in the mold of Disraeli \u2019 s \u201c One-Nation \u201d Toryism that dominated late 19th-century British politics , in which elites consciously made efforts to transcend class interests and govern in the interests of the whole nation .\nJ.D .\nVance \u2019 s GOP primary win in Ohio was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans .\nBut while Vance \u2019 s focus on the real needs of working-class Americans is a laudable model for the party , it is not that focus that will make Vance an effective power broker .\nIt is not the J.D .\nVance of the holler , but the Vance of Yale Law , the venture capitalist with deep connections to billionaire Peter Thiel and media powerhouse Tucker Carlson , whose wife was a clerk for Chief Justice Roberts , who can exercise power within the American system .\nAs the writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c all politics is elite politics .\nThe only thing that changes is the client class and their level of obligation felt to it.\n\u201d The GOP \u2019 s core \u201c deplorables , \u201d who are typically whiter , more rural , predominantly middle and working class , and often not college educated , represent a declining demographic with less and less access to the power structure with each passing year ( almost two-thirds of voters were white non-college when Reagan won in 1980 ; today , the number is approximately half that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead a new-right coalition is a losing strategy .\nAnd whilereaching out to a multicultural and working-class coalition is good , it will not solve the GOP \u2019 s problems in the corridors of power .\nIf the poor white voters of Appalachia can not meaningfully assume political leadership in 2022 , neither can the poor Hispanic voters of South Texas , among whom Trump performed so strongly in 2020 .\nWhile Trump accelerated the GOP \u2019 s problem among American elites , it preceded him by many years and was evident even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTwenty-six of the 27 wealthiest congressional districts are represented by Democrats .\nMeanwhile , Trump won white suburbanites by 4 points in 2020 , down sharply from his 16-point win in 2016 .\nAt the same time , he increased his rural-vote share from 59 percent to 65 percent .\nEven Trump \u2019 s vaunted gains among Hispanics were achieved down-market : He won 41 percent of non-college-educated Hispanics and only 30 percent of college-eductated Hispanic voters .\nThis breakdown mirrored Trump \u2019 s performance with white Americans .\nHe beat \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters .\nMeanwhile , Trump lost white college grads 57-40 , a number that was almost certainly worse among graduates of top-tier colleges from which the elite draws their leadership .\nAgainst Hillary Clinton in 2016 , Trump won 56 percent of white voters who make $ 100,000 or less but lost 53 percent of white voters making $ 175,000 or more .\nMillionaires favored Biden 56-39 .\nBiden out-raised Trump , a billionaire who has spent his entire life in wealthy circles , almost two to one .\nEven the relatively dire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the GOP .\nIn most of the key institutions of our society , the right is almost non-existent .\nThe most prestigious newspapers favored Biden almost unanimously .\nPolls of liberal-arts faculty have shown a 12-to-1 disparity in support for Biden over Trump .\nMore representative of truly elite academia is Harvard , where more than 99 percent of faculty donations went to Biden and only 2 percent of faculty voted for Trump in the 2016 election .\nAt Harvard , 99 percent of student donation money also went to Biden .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanding heights of our current culture , 98 percent of corporate donations went to Democrats .\nIn government , Joe Biden took 92 percent of the vote in the city of Washington , D.C. itself and 80 percent in inner suburbs like Arlington and Alexandria in Virginia and Prince George \u2019 s and Montgomery County in Maryland .\nOnly approximately 5 percent of senior civil servants are conservative Republicans .\nIt is the same story in Hollywood , where 99.7 percent of the donations of the top Hollywood power players went to Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter-revolution is accepting the low place we currently occupy in America \u2019 s power hierarchy .\nWe must understand ourselves as a fundamentally dissident movement seeking to supplant much of the existing managerial order .\nThe new right must not be \u201c conservative , \u201d or it will be doomed to failure .\nAs Julius Krein wrote in American Affairs , speaking of the current GOP \u2019 s failures : \u201c By failing to correctly recognize the nature of the managerial elite and its sources of power , [ the right \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the effect of recent conservative policy , whatever its intent , has been the strengthening of the managerial class.\n\u201d Burnham understood that in the modern managerial society , the managerial elite could only be displaced by a counter-elite , one comparable in talents and abilities to the current elite , but whose interests were not being served by the current regime .\nThus Burnham , the acknowledged intellectual leader at early National Review ( including by Buckley himself ) , had been one of the few at the magazine to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldwater in 1964 .\nAs Neal Freemam recounted , Burnham argued that \u201c Rockefeller was an Ivy Leaguer , a well-connected establishmentarian , a sophisticated candidate who could expect more positive treatment from the [ E ] astern press.\n\u201d But National Review \u2019 s editors supported Goldwater , who lost in a landslide .\nThe Democrats used those supermajorities to create Medicare , the National Endowment of the Arts , the Corporation for Public Broadcasting , the Department of Transportation , and the Department of Housing and Urban Development .\nCongress soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil Rights Act , the latter of which was identified by Christopher Caldwell in his book The Age of Entitlement as a new constitution based on group identities that was fundamentally incompatible with America \u2019 s existing constitutional order .\nAll of this was enabled in part by the right \u2019 s selection of elite-phobic Goldwater as their standard-bearer .\nGeorge Will wrote in the wake of Reagan \u2019 s election that \u201c Goldwater won in 1964 .\nIt just took 16 years to count the votes.\n\u201d But looking at today \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more accurate to say that George McGovern , the Democratic candidate blown out by Richard Nixon in 1972 , won his election , and it just took a half-century to count the votes .\nOur current political battlespace bears far more resemblance to McGovern \u2019 s radical interest-group-based left-wing politics than it does Reagan \u2019 s \u2019 80s idyll .\nRetrospectively , as emotionally appealing as Goldwater \u2019 s politics were for the frustrated right , his candidacy was a strategic disaster for the right \u2019 s political priorities , and ushered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only interrupted , and not fundamentally altered , by Reagan \u2019 s two terms in office .\nAs Trump \u2019 s campaign would a half century later , Goldwater highlighted the dangers of attacking the elite without developing a viable counter-elite to replace it with .\nWhere might we find counter-elite today ?\nBy far the richest prize to win from the Democrats , because of the demographic \u2019 s size , its current institutional power outside of politics , and its alienation from Democratic Party power centers , is white men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear implausible ; the GOP is not exactly suffering from a dearth of white men in leadership , and the Democrats have not won the white vote since LBJ \u2019 s 1964 landslide over Goldwater .\nBut it is not that the GOP needs more white-male leaders .\nIn fact , much of the GOP \u2019 s problem has been that its white-male leadership has been too cowardly to advance the legitimate interests of white voters .\nRather , the GOP needs more leaders , of all demographics , who will fight unapologetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of white voters , willing to contrast their efforts to the Democrats \u2019 racial vilification of white voters .\nWhat is remarkable about the white vote is not that the Democrats have lost it for 60 years , but that the GOP does not win it by the sorts of margins the Democrats have regularly won Hispanics and Asian Americans , if not African Americans .\nIt can appeal to elite white men by showing them that the Democrats \u2019 class and cultural claims on them are swamped by the overwhelming racial discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And here the numbers are compelling : Between 26 and 28 percent of Joe Biden \u2019 s 2020 voters were white men .\nYet , other than the addled figurehead of Biden himself , white men are increasingly absent in elite Democratic politics .\nIncredibly , none of Biden \u2019 s 25 cabinet members are white Americans of Protestant background .\nAnd though they make up the overwhelming majority of the white population , there are only five non-Jewish white Americans in Biden \u2019 s cabinet , running the generally less prestigious departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transportation , Energy , and Veterans Affairs ) .\nJust 27 percent of Biden \u2019 s judiciary picks have been white , which is only about half of the percentage of white voters who joined his coalition , and perhaps one-third as representative of the source of his donor funds .\nEven more starkly , just two of Biden \u2019 s first 41 judicial picks were white men ( about 5 percent ) even though white men likely contributed ( if donor profiles are accurate ) the majority of Biden \u2019 s campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democrats are supporting a party that rhetorically despises them and works against their fundamental material interests .\nContrast the treatment of white men within the Democratic Party to the status of white American men outside of Democratic Party politics .\nThis is not a stable equilibrium .\nEven today , white men make up more than 85 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs .\nAt approximately 60 percent of the population , white Americans hold 86 percent of the household wealth .\nSome 90 percent of published American authors are white , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best-sellers last year , and overall , a substantial majority of these authors are white men .\nLooking at successful \u201c unicorn \u201d startups , among those that achieve more than $ 1 billion market value as private companies , 77 percent of the founders were white .\nAnd , as a recently complied list of the 40 best ( highest-return ) venture capital investments of all time showed , of the 43 U.S.-based founders , 39 were white men .\nA party that relentlessly marginalizes a successful and numerous group should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as long as that group is offered an attractive alternative .\nThe GOP must create this alternative .\nThe white working class is a declining social and political force .\nThe minority working classes , while rising in numbers and needed as an important part of the right \u2019 s electoral coalition , still have even less cultural and political clout .\nWhile the GOP should certainly seek their votes and advocate for their interests , winning those votes will only provide a possible path to office , not a path to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections is useful but insufficient .\nThe managerial class has ruled America for decades , whether their representatives were in or out of office .\nOnly a counter-elite can challenge our current managerial masters , and it is to the unashamed development and cultivation of that counter-elite , particularly among white voters excoriated by the Democratic regime , that the right must devote the lion \u2019 s share of its political energies .\nJeremy Carl is a senior fellow at the Claremont

recently , the originalist legal scholar John Eastman was an honored member of the Federalist Society .\nHe chaired the society \u2019 s Separation of Powers Practice Group and was a frequent speaker at its meetings .\nLeonard Leo , co-chairman of the Federalist Society , donated to Eastman \u2019 s 2010 campaign for the attorney generalship of California .\nThings changed after Eastman advised Donald Trump \u2019 s attempt to challenge the 2020 presidential election results .\nEastman no longer chairs the Federalist Society practice group , and according to a statement from his employer , the Claremont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussing \u201c essential constitutional questions \u201d at the society \u2019 s meetings .\nThe Federalist Society \u2019 s longstanding support of Eastman was only one element of its effort to promote originalist principles .\nOfficially , the Federalist Society takes no position on originalism .\nIn practice , it has done more than any other organization to advance that philosophy .\nThrough its work , the idea that constitutional interpretation should bracket moral questions and political considerations while focusing purely on the text \u2019 s original meaning has become dominant on the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House \u2019 s January 6 committee .\nGiven that committee \u2019 s partisan makeup , this is hardly surprising .\nEastman \u2019 s treatment at the hands of the Federalist Society is more striking .\nEastman reached his radical conclusions not by defecting from originalist methods , but by following them with remarkable consistency .\nThis does not necessarily justify his conclusions , with which many originalists disagree .\nBut it reveals the profound tensions that threaten to tear the movement apart .\nOriginalism has two faces , moderate and radical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originalism is a facially neutral method that promises to settle contentious political issues by reference to the text , rather than by engaging substantive issues of right and wrong , it can appeal to moderates who fear open clashes of interests and views .\nLast year , I heard an originalist scholar say that he hoped the Supreme Court would not overturn Roe v. Wade , because doing so would endanger Republican hopes of winning the 2020 midterms .\nHe is an originalist of the moderate persuasion , and he is far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuit .\nThose who devote themselves to it share the interests and prejudices of their class .\nThey are invested in the current balance of power and so are likely to regard certain things as moderate ( reading transgenderism into the Civil Rights Act , say ) and other things as unthinkably radical ( for example , overturning Roe v. Wade ) .\nDespite the moderation of many of its practitioners , originalism can be a radical philosophy .\nInsisting on the original meaning of the written Constitution can profoundly unsettle the informal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that governs our politics .\nMy most vivid encounter with radical originalism came when I attended a seminar put on by the Claremont Institute .\nIt featured a debate between two originalist scholars , one of whom argued that birthright citizenship was not guaranteed by the Constitution .\nThis struck me as an implausible claim .\nI had absorbed the idea that birthright citizenship was fundamental to the American polity .\nYet as the two men argued , I was surprised to find that the critic of birthright citizenship was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of which his opponent was forced to concede .\nFor the first time I saw how destabilizing originalism can be .\nI had that unsettling experience a second time when I read Eastman \u2019 s debate about the 2020 election results with Joseph Bessette , an emeritus professor of government at Claremont McKenna College .\nTheir disagreement turns on whether the vice president is merely supposed to open the electoral votes , which are then counted by Congress , or whether he is also supposed to count them .\nWhoever counts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in case of dispute , to determine which votes are counted and which ones are set aside .\nEastman adduces evidence showing that , in academic and historical debates , originalists and other legal scholars have admitted the validity of reasoning very much like his .\nBessette argues forcefully against Eastman , but even Bessette \u2019 s critique suggests that there is more to Eastman \u2019 s argument than I had previously supposed .\nScholars of various persuasions have denounced Eastman in harsh terms while admitting sotto voce that he might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article published by the Atlantic in October , the liberal legal scholar Laurence Tribe cryptically suggested that something like the Eastman proposal could be followed by Kamala Harris in 2024 . )\nReading the arguments of Eastman and Bessette did not leave me certain of the rightness of either side .\nBehind the more technical questions , a basic conundrum remains .\nOn the one hand , it seems absurd that the vice president , who will often be a candidate for the presidency , should be able to judge his own case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power in the hands of Congress risks legislative domination of the executive .\nHowever one weighs these matters , it is undeniable that Eastman adhered to methods widely accepted by the men who shunned him .\nOne can regard Eastman \u2019 s proposal as wildly impractical or deeply immoral .\nOne can believe that he has a faulty constitutional theory or a wrongheaded view of politics .\nBut no one who looks seriously at his arguments can doubt that they are originalist .\nEastman has suffered an intellectual betrayal , one that calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s claims to be apolitical , but originalism \u2019 s claims to neutrality .\nOriginalists can and will discard their methods when they lead to unwelcome results .\nThis might not matter in practical terms if all originalists agreed .\nBut on issues extending far beyond the 2020 election , originalism is torn between two tendencies .\nOn one side are those who see originalism as a

Carlson , doyen of those dastardly \u201c New Right \u201d and national conservative cats .\nOz , plausibly the first Muslim-American senator , issued no encyclicals .\nOz played the hits , when this

few years , the world seemed to be a powder keg .\nTrump \u2019 s remarks about Taiwan and his imposition of aggressive sanctions threatened war with China .\nThe only question at the time seemed to be whether war would erupt in the Taiwan Strait or over some lousy lump of rock in the South China Sea , an archduke \u2019 s assassination for our time .\nElsewhere in Asia , Trump \u2019 s clumsy mano-a-mano with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nRumors had it Trump was ready to evacuate American dependents from South Korea .\nThen came the Tweet Wars , in which insults like \u201c Little Rocket Man \u201d and \u201c dotard \u201d were traded across the Pacific , sparking fears of nuclear war .\nThere would be no war , thankfully , as Trump contemplated withdrawing U.S. forces from the peninsula .\nThings looked dire in the Middle East , too .\nConflict seemed all but inevitable ; Trump had dumped the Obama-era nuclear accord with Iran , done something ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fanned the flames of Islamic rage by moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem .\nThat wasn \u2019 t all .\nNo one today remembers why , but the U.S. was supposedly also on the brink of war with Venezuela , and with NATO weakening , the dogs of war sat on the front stoop in Europe .\nTrump did , at least , withdraw most U.S. troops from Somalia .\nAt the end , though , things got really hairy , with both Nancy Pelosi and members of the Joint Chiefs terrified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with nuclear weapons .\nIn the midst of that chaos , the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientistswarned of \u201c a global race toward catastrophe \u201d and in 2019 set its famous Doomsday Clock at 100 seconds to midnight , the closest it had ever set the clock to apocalypse .\nIn the Bulletin \u2018 s telling , something was literally going to blow if no one let off the pressure .\nIt claimed that the 2020 \u201c leadership change in the United States provided hope that what seemed like a global race toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. engagement\u2014even reversed.\n\u201d Apparently , Joe Biden would lead the way .\nSo with the warmongering Trump safely stowed away in his lair at Mar-a-Lago , what of the peacemaker Biden ?\nBiden took office with no immediate crisis at hand .\nYet since taking office , he has committed blunder after blunder , wading into potential conflicts with nuclear-armed powers .\nThings have gotten mighty tense with China .\nBiden apparently envisions China as an autocratic foe against which the forces of democracy can wage a global struggle .\n\u201c On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c China will not achieve its goal to become the leading country in the world , the wealthiest country in the world , and the most powerful country in the world.\n\u201d Biden went on to claim the world was at an inflection point to determine \u201c whether or not democracy can function in the 21st century.\n\u201d In Biden \u2019 s neo-Churchillian view , the U.S. and the whole free world are in a nuclear death match with China .\nBiden has had plenty of diplomatic gaffes .\nHe broke code and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend Taiwan , which would involve nuclear weapons .\nSaber rattling ?\nYes , please .\nEven as Chinese President Xi spoke of peaceful reunification during the October political holidays , the U.S. , U.K. , and Japan conducted joint operations in the China Sea .\nMeanwhile , Australia ditched a $ 66 billion contract for French diesel-electric submarines , deciding instead to buy U.S. nuclear-powered subs .\nThat enraged China and NATO-ally France .\nCalling Biden \u2019 s actions Trumpian ( a\u00efe ! )\n, France withdrew its ambassadors from Washington and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Biden ever recruiting France into a coalition against Chinese power , or China against North Korea .\nAnd la-di-da to Candidate Biden \u2019 s promises to repair U.S. alliances post-Trump .\nThat occurred alongside a new Pacific parley , with Australia , the U.S. , and the U.K. planning to share advanced technologies .\nThe conference formed as a result of the U.S. military \u2019 s muscular diplomacy , apparently in hopes that a war with China will sustain military budgets for decades to come .\nA side deal with Britain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly part of the package .\nThis brings both the nuclear-armed Brits and the Australians into the South China Sea .\nIt is as if an arms salesman wrote Biden \u2019 s policy .\nIn the background of this conference looms research , performed by all sides , into hypersonic weapons capable of delivering nukes under existing missile shields .\nIn the greater Middle East , America \u2019 s cut-and-run exit after 20 years in Afghanistan left the region in tatters .\nThe U.S. embassy in Jerusalem remains a sore thumb for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Iran deal with the participation of the Russians and unable to do so without them , Biden has not changed the nuclear calculus between the U.S. , Israel , and Iran .\nTwo of those three remain nuclear powers , and the other sits on the threshold either to suffer another brushback from the Israelis or slide into the abyss .\nAnd for fun , Biden redeployed troops to Somalia .\nThen there \u2019 s Russia .\nAfter Putin invaded Ukraine , Biden had several options .\nHe could have taken the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the U.S. and lumping it alongside Donbas , Georgia , and Crimea .\nKick in some new sanctions , maybe some arms sales , a lot of \u201c standing with \u201d proclamations .\nBiden could have demanded NATO take its role as defender of free Europe seriously , and supported a NATO-led effort to impose sanctions and send military assistance to Ukraine .\nAnother option would have been to waive NATO aside as the generally useless organization that it is and implement U.S.-led sanctions and military assistance to Ukraine .\nHe could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine to U.S. prestige , pretended NATO was standing tough , and devoted U.S. military resources to everything short of direct combat with Russia .\nWhat did Biden choose ?\nAll of the above , plus a stated policy of watering the fields of Ukraine with the blood of Russian martyrs as if it was 1980 in Afghanistan again .\nThe goal is not just to have Russia leave Ukraine in defeat , but to attrit them to the last possible man in doing so .\nAmong the many problems of this bleed- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. and Russia on a direct collision course ; the only reason the U.S. \u2019 s provision of targeting data to sink flagships and kill generals in the field didn \u2019 t spark a war is because a Ukrainian finger was presumably on the trigger , not an American one .\nThis strategy has provoked the first serious mention of the use of nuclear weapons of the 21st century .\nSuddenly , what could have faded into the distance as a semi-failed incursion into Ukraine became the first struggle of the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle is about defending \u201c democracy writ large for the world.\n\u201d It \u2019 s Top Gun III , with everything from Russian pride to Putin \u2019 s regime \u2019 s survival on the line .\nAnd when everything is on the line , you invoke the \u201c everything \u201d weapon : nukes .\nPutin is a cautious man , but accidents happen , and miscalculations with nukes sting .\nWhile Biden is talking up the bleeding strategy as a common-sense response to Russian aggression , the shift amounts to a significant escalation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a more violent war , the United States greatly increased the danger of sparking an even larger conflict : the atomic threats from Moscow .\nThe risk way outweighs any realistic reward .\nEarlier U.S. rattling about a blitzkrieg threatening Poland and beyond seems near-comical as the Russian offensive bogs down in the mud of eastern Ukraine .\nWhat kind of strategy is it when Biden risks all for nothing much ?\nWhat kind of gamesmanship is it to tell your equally armed nuclear opponent that humiliation is his only way out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bulletin \u2018 s hope for peace upon the election of Joe Biden was crushed by Russia , with a major assist from Biden himself .\nThe clock stays set at 100 seconds to midnight\u2014the same place

Shellenberger \u2019 s San Fransicko , written from the perspective of chastened progressivism , and Seth Barron \u2019 s more avowedly conservative The Last Days of New York .\nIconic New York and incomparably beautiful San Francisco , both endowed with a surfeit of wealth as well as entrepreneurial and artistic talent , seem to be veering towards ungovernability .\nComparable books could be written about Seattle , Minneapolis , Los Angeles , or Philadelphia .\nAfter American urban life seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades , the gains have halted , in some cases even reversed .\nCrime rates , trending in a bad direction for nearly a decade , have risen sharply in the last two years .\nDeference to Black Lives Matter and its key tenet , contempt for policing , has become the default stance of the governing and opinion-shaping class that rules most American cities .\nSeth Barron takes as his pivot the two mayoral terms of Bill de Blasio , the city \u2019 s recently departed progressive mayor .\nFor many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then coast to reelection , was difficult to fathom .\nUnlike many liberals , de Blasio never seemed knowledgeable or much interested in city government .\nHis r\u00e9sum\u00e9 , after a youthful stint in Sandinista solidarity work , consisted of campaign and political staff jobs where he made few good impressions .\nNeither veteran congressman Charles Rangel nor ex-mayor David Dinkins , his previous employers , endorsed his mayoral bid in 2013 .\nBut de Blasio worked hard to create a political persona viable for New York elections .\nThe son of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under loyalty suspicions during the McCarthy era , de Blasio dropped his father \u2019 s surname Wilhelm in his twenties for his mother \u2019 s , the more ethnic-friendly de Blasio .\nHis courtship of black lesbian Chirlane McCray , a fellow staffer in David Dinkins \u2019 s City Hall , led to marriage , a honeymoon in Castro \u2019 s Cuba , and children whom the couple has never been embarrassed about using as political props .\nHis son \u2019 s flamboyant afro and de Blasio \u2019 s public musings about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence helped separate him from the pack of like-minded progressives in his first mayoral primary .\nBarron cites several black lawmakers who called him out for insincerity : using flyers touting his family in black neighborhoods , stand-alone photos in white ones .\nNevertheless , the formulas worked , and de Blasio took the reins of a prosperous and well-run city in 2014 .\nThe 2008 recession had let New York off easy\u2014much of Washington \u2019 s emergency stimulus packages went to Wall Street\u2014and the recovery transformed into a decade-long bull market stampede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city \u2019 s rich , but Wall Street salaries accounted for 20 percent of private-sector wages .\nThe ultra-rich , the 3,500 individuals who make up the top 0.1 percent of the city \u2019 s earners , pay about a quarter of the city \u2019 s income tax .\nThe boom allowed the progressive mayor and city council to engage in spending galore , a 28 percent rise during his mayoralty , three times the rate of inflation .\nNew initiatives ranged from the lavish ( costs to run the city hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to the ridiculous ( a videographer to record the achievements of Chirlane McCray , resulting in a video of her dancing to Sister Sledge \u2019 s \u201c We Are Family \u201d in front of Gracie Mansion ) .\nDe Blasio \u2019 s signature policy in his first term was bestowing a City Hall blessing on the burgeoning anti-police movement inspired by Black Lives Matter .\nOne of his first acts as mayor was to surrender the city \u2019 s appeal of a dubious lower court ruling against \u201c Stop , Question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had proved outstandingly effective at getting illegal guns off the street .\nAs a result , New York cops faced federal monitoring .\nDe Blasio doubled down on his stance on policing after the death of Eric Garner , a morbidly obese man out on bail who died while resisting arrest for a minor crime .\nThe mayor convened a public roundtable , to which he invited Al Sharpton , famous for decades of incendiary race-baiting , and gave him equal billing with police commissioner Bill Bratton , who had presided over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city \u2019 s history .\nAnother signature of de Blasio \u2019 s tenure was the amping of racial rhetoric around the school system .\nHe appointed Richard Carranza as schools chancellor , who notably picked a fight with white and Asian parents over access to the city \u2019 s sterling exam-entry public high schools .\nIt became common for progressive politicians to throw around the term \u201c apartheid schools \u201d to describe those with few white students .\nIt was never explained how whites , who comprised 15 percent of students in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast city to avoid \u201c apartheid \u201d or indeed why they were necessary for black and Latino students to learn at expected grade levels .\nBarron makes clear that de Blasio was more a cog in the progressive system than an innovator , as much pushed by a left-wing city council majority as setting its agenda .\nOne of the more depressing arguments of his often sardonically amusing book is Barron \u2019 s claim that New York City politics has become effectively a one-party system , not simply a preserve of Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electoral contest that counts , but one where progressives like de Blasio are the only ones able to survive in an environment dominated by left-wing non-profit groups , labor union political-action committees , and progressive-controlled political clubs .\nThese institutions have combined to form a sort of progressive \u201c deep state.\n\u201d Those who don \u2019 t like this kind of government will leave , leaving progressives more firmly in control .\nCity elections , once spirited and ideologically intense , have become desultory low-turnout affairs .\nSan Fransicko is a well-researched and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former progressive environmental activist who recently announced his candidacy for governor .\nHe is eloquent and knowledgeable , especially on the now salient issue of homelessness .\nRunning in a state with a history of opening a path to non-professional politicians , he could well emerge from the non-party June primary as a contender against Gavin Newsom .\nHe describes a city whose problems are less dire and less structural than New York \u2019 s .\nThough car thefts and smash-and-grab robberies have surged in recent months , San Francisco still has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its neighbor across the bay and the birthplace of the Black Panther Party , does not ) .\nBut San Francisco has become known nationally for its homeless problem .\nUnlike New York , which over the last forty years has built shelters with beds for tens of thousands , the California city has built few .\nAdvocates have argued that the homeless deserve full-fledged housing , not a shelter bed .\nBut it costs $ 500,000 or more to build an apartment for a homeless person in San Francisco , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of them , it has never come close to satisfying demand .\nSan Francisco gives out generous cash benefits to the homeless , and its relatively warm climate and tolerant culture have resulted in a lot of them moving there .\nHundreds , perhaps thousands , of homeless people live on the city \u2019 s streets or parks in encampments .\nDrug use is open and widespread .\nSan Fransicko opens with a vignette of mayor London Breed , who grew up in San Francisco public housing , observing that the level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like nothing she had ever seen .\nAny visitor to the city is struck by encounters with these people , some clearly mentally ill , others addicted to drugs .\nNone of this is new .\nSan Francisco has been engaging in a tug of war for nearly two generations between the city \u2019 s businesses and voters , and occasionally its political leaders , and the progressive advocates who think it cruel and reactionary to prevent the homeless from dominating a growing share of the city \u2019 s space .\nBecause San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s been a kind of standoff : dismay at disorder arises , a mayor cracks down , the issue loses saliency , and the homeless return in greater numbers .\nThe current debate hinges on to what degree the city and state ought to require enforced psychiatric treatment or monitored drug abstinence in return for concrete assistance , whether cash benefits or state-provided housing .\nThe existing consensus is that neither California nor the city have the right to demand anything at all .\nShellenberger demonstrates conclusively that present policies of laissez-faire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s homeless .\nHis proposed alternative is based on the experience of European cities , including famously tolerant Amsterdam , where once-thriving open-air drug markets have been suppressed .\nAs a veteran Dutch drug policy expert told him , \u201c For every homeless person we make a plan .\nWe made tens of thousands of these plans.\n\u201d Frankly , it seems a stretch to imagine an American city government effectively coordinating such a comprehensive package of carrots and sticks , involving drug treatment specialists , the police , and service providers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is approaching the moment when tolerance of public squalor has once again reached a limit .\nSan Francisco has been at the progressive edge of the American spectrum for generations .\nIt was the birthplace of hippiedom and before that of beat culture .\nShellenberger relates how in the 1970s much of the city \u2019 s political elite treated the \u201c apostolic Marxist \u201d Peoples Temple leader Jim Jones as a moral paragon .\nJones \u2019 s reputation diminished only after he decamped for Guyana and ordered his followers to drink the poisoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical of George Soros \u2019 s lineup of progressive district attorneys , is a beneficiary of this tradition .\nWhereas Bill de Blasio is something of an apparatchik , Boudin is genuine progressive royalty .\nThe son of Weather Underground terrorists , raised by Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn while his parents were in prison , the grandson of a famous communist-orbit attorney , a graduate of Yale and its law school , with a stint as a translator and aide to Venezuelan Marxist strongman Hugo Chavez behind him , Boudin probably more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the radical left can take power in the United States by normal electoral means .\nSan Francisco is a relatively small city , but it has served as the springboard for the careers of Dianne Feinstein , Gavin Newsom , Nancy Pelosi , and Kamala Harris , so the aspiration is not easily dismissed .\nBoudin \u2019 s election night victory party was punctuated by boisterous chants of \u201c F\u2014 the POA \u201d ( the Police Officer \u2019 s Association ) .\nAs district attorney , Boudin has made reducing the jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense attorneys by seeking lower sentences for convicted criminals than the defense attorneys themselves .\nSan Franciscans did not elect Boudin to be the city \u2019 s top law-enforcement official by a wide margin , but they did choose him .\nBut there are at least tentative signs that the urban progressive ascendancy might have peaked in both New York and San Francisco .\nNo one would mistake Eric Adams , New York \u2019 s new mayor , for Rudy Giuliani , but the former cop \u2019 s campaign was the most associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates running in the Democratic primary .\nIn an off-term and low turnout election , San Francisco voted to recall the three most left-wing of nine school board commissioners .\nVoters were dissatisfied that the board spent more energy on \u201c anti-racism \u201d than keeping the schools functioning during the pandemic .\nChesa Boudin faces his own recall election this June .\nIt was no small matter to gather signatures to get the measure on the ballot .\nIt will be a more highly financed and higher turnout contest , and a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressive wave .\nCandor requires acknowledging the soundness of both Barron and Shellenberger \u2019 s analysis .\nBut the question is how impermeable is the power of the new urban progressive deep state .\nCan it be shifted by normal electoral politics ?\nHere the example of Rudy Giuliani is pertinent .\nAfter he was elected New York \u2019 s mayor in 1993 , Giuliani changed the way the city did policing , brought the murder rate down by a factor of five , and changed dramatically the sense of American urban possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstanding book Prince of the City ( 2005 ) , Giuliani was profoundly wonkish , eager to vacuum up ideas about urban governance from all quarters .\nHe was also a bulldog workaholic , putting in 80 hour weeks and bringing into city government a team\u2014many drawn from the federal prosecutor \u2019 s office\u2014ready to match his zeal .\nHe may only have been conservative in his passion for law and order and his disdain for racial double standards , but that in itself was transformational .\nIt is not irrelevant that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ran for reelection in 1997 .\nBut Giuliani was also able to surf a national wave with few contemporary parallels : a new movement within the Democratic party , centered in institutions like the Democratic Leadership Council , that pushed a rethinking of Sixties and New Deal liberalism .\nBill Clinton was a fellow traveler of this movement , and other Democrats were open to its perspectives .\nThus Giuliani had national Democrats ready to engage him and wish him well .\nNo one yet knows the name of the person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we shouldn \u2019 t , therefore , conclude that the progressive ascension depicted by Barron will last forever .\nIt is true that the white ethnic enclaves that once provided an electoral base for law and order no longer count for much demographically .\nBut who does live in America \u2019 s cities ?\nThe fastest-growing voter group is Asians , disparate by economic class and national origin .\nThey have been a Democratic bloc for the past twenty years .\nBut in last year \u2019 s New York mayoral race , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Queens voted for Curtis Sliwa , a law-and-order Republican with no chance of victory .\nIn San Francisco last February , Asian voters leaned heavily in favor of recalling the left-wing , anti-white school-board members .\nThese may be harbingers of

under the cloak of invisibility .\nThe Biden administration announced on April 27 that it had tapped Jankowicz to head a new \u201c Disinformation Governance Board \u201d under the Department of Homeland Security .\nJust three weeks later , Jankowicz is out and the project has been put on \u201c pause , \u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed last Wednesday .\nConservatives were quick to declare victory over Biden \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sustained pressure campaign of jokes and memes made even liberals uncomfortable with the new DHS outfit and put the administration on its heels .\nBut the left , and the administrative state that safeguards its interests , doesn \u2019 t care all that much how conservatives respond to efforts to control information .\nControlling information is and always will be more important to upending the American system than whether political enemies hate them a little more .\nThere is still political utility in bullying progressives when they attempt something so brazen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not what ultimately led to the Biden administration \u2019 s decision to pause the Disinformation Governance Board .\nThe administration chose to delay and regroup because of much more practical reasons .\nThe project was half-baked , its mission was unclear , and its infrastructure was underdeveloped , which made the Disinformation Governance Board a tough sell .\nAfter the Senate voted to confirm Alejandro Mayorkas as DHS Secretary on Feb. 2 , 2021 , the new secretary , referring especially to Jan. 6 , determined it was time to focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d and any other form of information with a negative prefix .\nThe first step : set up a working group to consider how DHS might go about combating malign activity online .\nThe group , overseen by the department \u2019 s office of policy and office of intelligence and analysis , mulled a number of issues , from alleged Russian intelligence operatives posting false claims about the U.S. election on social media to human smugglers using social media to lure in new victims .\nIn an attempt to make all of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that departments within DHS lacked the information sharing capabilities to coordinate a coherent response , or proper guidelines to ensure that cross-department coordination was done appropriately .\nThe answer to the working group \u2019 s problem ?\nAnother working group , of course .\nJohn Cohen , then a top counterterrorism official at DHS , was part of the first working group and wrote a memo setting up the second , according to Politico .\nAt the time , no one at DHS seemed to think this was a big deal .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u2018 Hey , what should we be doing about Russian disinformation focusing on X , Y , and Z ?\n\u2019 \u201d Cohen told Politico .\n\u201c They \u2019 re focusing on , \u2018 Hey , information is being gathered and collected under different sets of legal authorities .\nWhat is the appropriate way to share that information so we \u2019 re not in conflict with those legal authorities ?\n\u2019 \u201d But the working group was evidently unable to work out the particulars before the existence of the Disinformation Governance Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boasted about the board shortly after its existence became public during a House Appropriations Subcommittee hearing .\nResponding to a question from Democratic Illinois Rep. Lauren Underwood about misinformation campaigns against minority communities , Mayorkas said the DHS had recently created a Disinformation Governance Board that aims to \u201c bring the resources of ( DHS ) together to address this threat.\n\u201d Mayorkas told the subcommittee that Undersecretary for Policy Rob Silvers and principal deputy general counsel Jennifer Gaskill would co-chair the board .\nPolitico was the first to report Nina Jankowicz would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director .\nWhen the poorly named board and its poorly chosen executive director were predictably panned , the administration was put on the defensive .\nThen-White House press secretary Jen Psaki defended Jankowicz , calling her \u201c an expert on online disinformation\u2026 with extensive qualifications.\n\u201d \u201c This is work that is helping to address unauthorized terrorism , other threats , and see how disinformation , misinformation is being pushed , to lead , to increase those , so that \u2019 s all work that

under the former president , which is interesting to note contextually , \u201d Psaki added , though her comments have been undercut by reporting , like Politico \u2019 s May 5 report , that suggests the changing of the guard at DHS is what triggered DHS \u2019 s heavy interest in disinformation .\nIn her April 29 briefing , Psaki also referenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the board \u2019 s work .\nThe

of the American people , including disinformation spread by foreign states such as Russia , China , and Iran , or other adversaries such as transnational criminal organizations and human smuggling organizations .\nSuch malicious actors often spread disinformation to exploit vulnerable individuals and the American public , including during national emergencies.\n\u201d The fact sheet goes on to cite three prominent examples of when components of DHS has battled disinformation : CBP \u2019 s fight against human smugglers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about fake shelters during Hurricane Sandy , and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency \u2019 s ( CISA ) efforts to prevent the spread of Russian disinformation .\nThe Disinformation Governance Board was created , according to the fact sheet , \u201c with the explicit goal of ensuring these protections are appropriately incorporated across DHS \u2019 s disinformation-related work and that rigorous safeguards are in place .\nThe working group also seeks to coordinate the Department \u2019 s engagements on this subject with other federal agencies and a diverse range of external stakeholders.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u201c the working group does not have any operational authority or capability.\n\u201d So , without \u201c any operational authority or capability , \u201d the Disinformation Governance Board was expected to tamp down on disinformation from Russia , China , Iran , human smugglers , U.S. border policy , the war in Ukraine , 2020 election fraud , coronavirus , race , as well as national disasters and climate change ?\nAll while \u201c protect [ ing ] Americans \u2019 freedom of speech , civil rights , civil liberties , and privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nThe Disinformation Governance Board \u2019 s sweeping and vague mandate made it difficult for the administration to defend the board and concisely explain what it would do .\nMayorkas made the rounds on Sunday shows shortly after the board was announced , mostly regurgitating points from the fact sheet with his own spin .\nHe told CNN \u2019 s Dana Bash on State of the Union that the board \u201c works to ensure that the way in which we address threats , the connectivity between threats and acts of violence are addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil rights and civil liberties , the right of privacy.\n\u201d When pressed on the board , Mayorkas said \u201c we probably could have done a better job of communicating what it does and does not do , \u201d its critics are spreading a narrative that is \u201c precisely the opposite of what this small working group within the Department of Homeland Security will do.\n\u201d On NBC \u2019 s Meet the Press , Mayorkas more or less said the same , that the board would confront disinformation \u201c in a way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not infringe on civil liberties , \u201d and again admitted \u201c We could have done a better job of communicating what it is and what it isn \u2019 t. \u201d To put together a better communications strategy and create an outfit capable of achieving the plethora of goals the Biden administration set for the Disinformation Governance Board , a DHS advisory council will review the project and make recommendations in 75 days .\nEven though conservatives are having fun dunking on Jankowicz for really teaching the Biden administration \u201c How to Lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve only won the first battle .\nThough probably under a new name and leadership , the Disinformation Governance Board will likely return and be more dangerous to American liberties than ever

foundations to push radical climate legislation , fund ideological lawsuits against the oil and gas industry , shut down coal-burning power plants , and train new activists .\nThat figure represents an almost half-a-billion-dollar increase from 2019 , when environmentalist groups reported close to $ 2.7 billion in total revenue .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these 200 organizations represent a fraction of the groups pushing for Green New Deal-type policies .\nFor clarity \u2019 s sake , my list only includes climate- or environment-focused nonprofits , but virtually every group on the left , from the

Please rest assured you will receive the 990s within the 30-day window outlined in section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( B ) \u201d of the Internal Revenue Code , he told me via email .\nWhat is known is that the

them\u2014producing the claim that skeptics spend $ 1 billion per year blocking action on global warming .\nYet he manufactured that impressive figure by measuring the incomes of broadly right-leaning

the Code of Canon Law , which prevents those who \u201c obstinately persist in manifest grave sin \u201d from receiving Holy Communion .\nThe archbishop announced the move weeks after Pelosi called

argued that Pelosi \u2019 s support for abortion \u201c just doesn \u2019 t matter \u201d because she is acting \u201c as the people \u2019 s agent \u201d and the way she \u201c represents the people

before the Second Vatican Council , and a rejection of the soft universalism that has reigned in corners of the Church \u2019 s human element since the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person the Eucharist suggests that it is possible for someone to place himself outside the boundaries of Catholic communion and , therefore , outside the bounds of Christ \u2019 s Church .\nIt \u2019 s not just Hans

on the worthy reception of the Eucharist and are therefore scandalized by his apparently \u201c exclusionary \u201d practice .\nSt. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eucharistic species unworthily \u201c eateth and drinketh judgment to himself.\n\u201d The Church has historically interpreted this passage to mean that all Catholics in a state of mortal sin , with few exceptions , are to avoid receiving the Eucharist until they \u2019 ve made a valid sacramental confession , which requires the penitent to have a firm purpose of amendment to avoid the sin in the future .\nMany Catholics are unfamiliar with the Church \u2019 s teaching .\nIf you attend a Mass in the suburban United States , it shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach the priest for Communion after the Agnus Dei prayers .\nHow many have gone to confession ?\nIt \u2019 s unknown , and not for me to speculate , but I do know that many well-to-do parishes hold confessions just once per week for about 30 minutes .\nIt is not uncommon for the priests at those parishes to hear fewer than five confessions in their half-hour in the box .\nIt is possible that the Catholics of Strathmere , New Jersey , are an extraordinarily holy bunch , but it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of sin or poor catechesis\u2014is at work .\nAbstaining from the Eucharist is not , of itself , a virtue .\nThe only reason one should do is if\u2014speaking from some experience here\u2014one is conscious of having committed a mortal sin .\nI only mean to say that taking the Church \u2019 s teaching on the Eucharist seriously involves regularly examining one \u2019

hierarchy refuse to exercise sacramental discipline .\nTheir refusal is , in part , a response to perceived disciplinary excesses in the pre-conciliar Church .\nThis , in effect , has lead some of the faithful to believe that the Church \u2019 s teaching on the reception of Holy Communion has changed .\nIt has not .\nAnd the unwillingness of certain element within the Church to let their \u201c yes \u201d mean \u201c yes \u201d and their \u201c no \u201d mean \u201c no \u201d on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurdity of a Speaker of the House in one breath calling herself a \u201c Catholic mother of five

an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act as judge of the Speaker or anyone else .\nBut before consuming the Eucharist , Nancy Pelosi , like all Catholics , must form her conscience and examine herself .\nIf she refuses

Dollar", "content": "\u201c Give me control of a nation \u2019 s money , \u201d an 18th-century banking oligarch once said , \u201c and I care not who makes its laws.\n\u201d That may have sounded like hubris at the time , but digital technology could soon make it an understatement .\nCentral bank digital currencies ( CBDCs ) , currently in various stages of development around the world , are being created as a new form of money that , depending on how they are structured , could give government bureaucrats more control over citizens than any law ever could .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as money , commercial bank deposits denominated as dollars , a U.S. CBDC could be issued directly by our central bank to individuals in the form of a \u201c digital wallet.\n\u201d A digital dollar could also be programmable with controlling features .\nOn March 9 , President Biden took a first step toward creating a U.S. CBDC , directing his administration to report to him by this fall on whether and how to implement a federal digital dollar .\nAnd in February , the Boston Fed completed the first phase of Project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been developing together with MIT \u2019 s Digital Currency Initiative .\n\u201c My Administration places the highest urgency on research and development efforts into the potential design and deployment options of a United States CBDC , \u201d Biden \u2019 s order stated .\nAmong the goals he cited for a U.S. CBDC were faster and cheaper payments , financial stability , fighting financial crime , maintaining the preeminence and security of America \u2019 s currency , and \u201c financial inclusion and equity.\n\u201d Biden also ordered a report on \u201c the potential for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tackle climate change.\n\u201d Biden instructed Attorney General Merrick Garland to determine whether or not he will need congressional approval to implement a CBDC , and if so , to draft legislation by October , leading some observers to speculate that Democrats may try to introduce a bill before the midterms .\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in March 2021 that he would not move forward with establishing a U.S. CBDC \u201c without support from Congress , and I think that would ideally come in the form of an authorizing law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our law to enable this.\n\u201d But what the administration would do if it can not get legislation passed is unclear .\nNine countries have established CBDCs thus far , and 15 others , including China , Russia , and Sweden , currently have pilot programs in place .\nAltogether , 87 countries that collectively represent 90 percent of global GDP are in some stage in the development of CBDCs .\nThe European Central Bank ( ECB ) is also moving forward with the implementation of its own CBDC , the digital euro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks collectively representing one-fifth of the world \u2019 s population will issue CBDCs by 2025 .\nAgustin Carstens , general manager of the Bank of International Settlements , explained one of the key motivations to create CBDCs at an October 2020 IMF seminar : \u201c We don \u2019 t know who is using a $ 100 bill today , we don \u2019 t know who \u2019 s using a 1,000-peso bill today .\nThe key difference with a CBDC is the central bank will have absolute control of the rules and regulations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank liability , and also we will have the technology to enforce that.\n\u201d China has taken the lead on implementation among the world \u2019 s major economies , issuing its e-CNY , or digital yuan , in 2020 .\nBy the end of 2021 , the digital yuan had 261 million users , representing about one-fifth of China \u2019 s population , according to the People \u2019 s Bank of China .\nChina issues the e-CNY directly from its central bank to consumers , who set up a digital-wallet app that allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their phone at the point of sale , thereby transferring digital yuan directly from the buyer \u2019 s government account to the vendor \u2019 s without transaction fees .\nFor those who don \u2019 t have a smartphone , a British company called Walletmor now offers microchips that are implanted into a person \u2019 s palm .\nThe buyer makes payments by placing his hand over a vendor \u2019 s card reader .\nChina touts the privacy of these transactions ; users can set the app so that purchases are anonymous between buyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nUnlike cash , however , the Chinese government can observe and track every transaction .\n\u201c They \u2019 re dealing with vast amounts of data , so it \u2019 s difficult even today with the computers we have to handle it all , \u201d said former Fed official Chris Whalen , chairman of Whalen Global Advisors .\n\u201c But over time , these networks are only going to get more efficient and more robust , and they \u2019 ll be able to chew on this data and follow everything you do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency is not a herald call for freedom , \u201d Whalen said .\n\u201c In an authoritarian society , it will be used as a means of control.\n\u201d \u201c China \u2019 s reasons for doing this ought to horrify us all , \u201d said former Fed Vice Chair Randal Quarles , now chairman of the Cynosure Group , \u201c but there \u2019 s a concern that we \u2019 ll somehow fall behind them.\n\u201d \u201c There is a concern that the ECB is doing this , Sweden is doing this , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is moving forward , and we \u2019 ll be left behind , \u201d Quarles said .\n\u201c I just don \u2019 t think any of that is true .\nAnyone who has a teenager has heard this argument and pushed back against it .\nIt can \u2019 t be just : everyone is doing it , so I need to.\n\u201d In January , Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota introduced a bill to ban the Fed from establishing retail CBDC accounts , stating that \u201c not only would this CBDC model centralize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerable to attack , but it could be used as a surveillance tool that Americans should never tolerate from their own government.\n\u201d Among American consumers , there does not appear to be significant demand for the government to replace private commercial banks .\nAccording to an FDIC report , 94.6 percent of U.S. households had at least one bank account as of 2019 , and 97.3 percent of account holders were \u201c very or somewhat satisfied with their bank.\n\u201d Private initiatives such as the nonprofit Cities For Financial Empowerment Fund \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connect underserved people with affordable banking services , which may prove a simpler and more effective way to achieve inclusion than turning the Fed into a retail bank .\nFurthermore , it is questionable whether the Fed , or any government agency , realistically could handle hundreds of millions of individual accounts , process trillions of transactions , respond to customer inquiries , and conduct the required anti-money laundering and \u201c Know Your Customer \u201d inquiries that private banks currently perform .\nWhether or not private banks remain as intermediaries , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy would be greatly enhanced if the CBDC were programmable .\n\u201c When the White House was asked about the CBDC , they talked about how the currency could be used to improve diversity and equity and inclusion and all these other things , \u201d said Justin Haskins , a director at the Heartland Institute .\n\u201c The only way that any of this works the way they \u2019 re promising is if it is a programmable currency , and that means it can be controlled.\n\u201d \u201c This fits right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having more regulations , for having the Federal Reserve print more money , for giant welfare programs , for diversity , equity , and inclusion , \u201d Haskins said .\n\u201c You could accomplish all of those goals with a CBDC that is programmable in a much more effective way , and in a way that gives you political cover because you don \u2019 t need to pass a law to do it .\nYou could just do it all through the Federal Reserve.\n\u201d In order to make stimulus payments more effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative interest rates , which are a tax on savings , or even expiration dates .\nThis would impel Americans to spend rather than save .\nThe Fed could also pose restrictions on what CBDCs can be used for .\nEnvironmental policy could be implemented through the Fed by , for example , limiting the amount of CBDC a person can spend on gasoline .\nIf the federal government

"content": "The potential overturn of Roe is likely to shake up political coalitions in this country .\nMany predict that either party \u2019 s decision to push unpopular policies will redound to the advantage of the other party , especially among moderate voters and in the suburbs .\nMaybe so .\nTaking unpopular positions is , after all , unpopular .\nBut I think the more interesting controversy will take place within the Republican Party , between the pro-life voters who have long called the party home and some of the party \u2019 s more recent acquisitions in the Trump era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution .\nI doubt its founder , Dave Portnoy , thinks of himself as a Republican .\nBut I also doubt that a large number of people who have chanted \u201c Let \u2019 s go Brandon \u201d at football games and the like think of themselves as Republicans , either .\nAs Matthew Walther said , Portnoy represents a tendency in American life , whose members Walther called \u201c Barstool conservatives.\n\u201d Those voters are not inherently political people but have become increasingly politicized , especially by the Covid-19 pandemic and government responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him might not think of themselves as Republicans , but they pulled the lever for Donald Trump , and are now part of the GOP coalition .\nAnd what does Portnoy think about the potential overturn of Roe ?\n\u201c To go backwards , it shows how f\u2014ed up politics are\u2026if [ abortion ] is an issue , I vote Democrat.\n\u201d He also said that Republicans should agree with him on this issue , since it \u2019 s just \u201c some religious people \u201d trying to impose their view on the \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally thinking.\n\u201d And , he added , abortion bans would increase the power of the government to regulate people \u2019 s lives and decisions , which the GOP claims to be against .\nPortnoy was one of President Trump \u2019 s first and loudest supporters in popular culture .\nI was in high school for the 2016 election and the campaign preceding it .\nThere were a number of outspoken Trump fans at school , and if you had asked them why they supported Trump , especially in the primary , none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure to appoint justices to the Supreme Court who , given the chance , will overturn Roe.\n\u201d They were not family-values Republicans , and had no desire to be .\nThe cultural issues that moved them were not the ones that inspire the religious right .\nThey became Republicans anyway , because of Donald Trump .\nIn the past , Portnoy and those like him viewed the Republicans as insufferable moralists , busybodies intent on condemning other people for their choices , and generally no fun .\nBut because Trump was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed the Republican Party to escape this reputation among people who had no strong attachment either to Paul Ryan \u2019 s budgets or the tenets of social conservatism .\nAnd the Democrats \u2019 becoming the party that tells you what to do and condemns you as immoral if you don \u2019 t has only sealed these Barstool voters \u2019 attachment to the GOP\u2014the party of the libertines , the party of live and let live , the party of telling censorious elites to shove it .\nAnd now this strange alliance appears on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prospect of Roe \u2018 s overturn has prompted Portnoy to express surprise that any normal person would support restrictions on abortion , Republicans , especially at the state level , talk about imposing more restrictions and even bans .\nThose moves might prove electorally unpopular .\nWhile polling on abortion is a mess , it shows pretty consistently that only about 15 to 20 percent of the population favors a total ban on abortion .\nNot even a majority of Republicans favor a total ban .\nIt \u2019 s hardly a united @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t just about policy .\nIt \u2019 s about an attitude .\nThe appointment of the justice who would overturn Roe , and subsequently implementing whatever state-level abortion restrictions are possible , would be the first major win in a long time for the kind of social conservative more interested in policy related to moral issues than \u201c owning the libs \u201d about , say , content moderation on social media .\nThe former group \u2019 s numbers have been declining , which is why the GOP has moved away from the moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social media .\nSocial conservatives have nevertheless preserved the pro-life cause ; popular opinion hasn \u2019 t shifted on abortion the way it has on something like gay marriage , and , quite simply , abortion is the issue social conservatives care most about and have expended the most effort trying to fight .\nMaybe Portnoy and late-arriving Republicans like him are ignorant of the history and influence of the pro-life movement .\nTrump made these Barstool voters political , so I wonder how much attention they were paying to politics before Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s nomination seemed to promise liberation from religious cranks and moralizing scolds , on this issue , the old Republican Party isn \u2019 t dead .\nIf you hated the religious attitudes and moralizing of the Republican Party , Trump allowed you to overlook those things .\nBut the potential for the greatest social-conservative victory in a long time has brought those features back to the forefront .\nThe pro-life movement is shot through with religious cranks and moralizing scolds , a fact responsible for many of its best tendencies and many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly ) affectionately , since I myself am both a religious crank and a moralizing scold .\nWhere will the GOP go from here ?\nI suspect that , for social conservatives , the overturn of Roe could lead to a series of defeats .\nI don \u2019 t just mean that their pursuit of unpopular policies will probably be bad for them and the party at the ballot box .\nI mean that social conservatives could lose their grasp on the Republican Party .\nSome of this can be attributed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters who care strongly about abortion would still vote for the GOP even if the two major parties had identical stances on abortion .\nThose voters typically agree with the GOP \u2019 s policies on other issues .\nThe idea that the abortion issue has resulted in some large number of pro-life leftists holding their noses and voting Republican is simply not true .\nThere are about 50 of those people , half of whom I know personally .\nMost of them do not vote for either party .\nBut if Portnoy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether out of sincere belief or a self-interested desire to maintain a certain sexual culture , they could easily leave to GOP .\nWhen a party can take voters for granted , they don \u2019 t have to offer them much .\nThe GOP could get away with not doing much for pro-lifers , but not so for the \u201c Barstool conservatives.\n\u201d The other issue , as their inaction makes clear , much of the GOP leadership simply doesn \u2019 t care that much about the life issue and would rather not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something they had to do to appease some of their voters , but now the bills are due .\nA friend who worked in the office of a high-ranking Republican in Congress told me that the office was not uniformly pro-life , and , of those staff who were , he was the only one who cared strongly about the abortion issue .\nFor many Republican members , if they can get away with leaving the abortion issue aside and focusing on their true mission of being corporate shills , they will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the status quo .\nNot so for the state parties , where the true believers are .\nThe wave of proposed abortion legislation produced by state Republican legislature reveals as much .\nAnd , of course , the institutional network social conservatives have spent 50 years building up isn \u2019 t going to simply disappear .\nBut I worry they \u2019 ll be increasingly marginalized .\nThere will be more Todd Akins and Richard Mourdocks to come ; they will cost the GOP winnable elections and will be blamed for it .\nDefending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opportunities to put their feet in their mouths and leave themselves open to obvious attacks .\nThe transformation of social conservatism after Obergefell from a movement focused on a few specific moral issues into a catch-all collection will make it easier for the GOP to get distracted .\nAre abortions , changing standards of who gets to be a fashion model , and whatever Elon Musk might do with ownership of Twitter all issues of equal importance and moral weight ?\nNo , obviously not .\nBut a GOP media apparatus that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way and to the same effect creates that impression .\nThe pro-life movement is about to find itself in the position of the dog that caught the car .\nIt was easy to keep everyone on board by pointing to Roe and saying , \u201c We \u2019 re against that.\n\u201d Coming up with positive ideas is harder , and it is not yet clear how far many people who call themselves pro-life will be willing to go .\nIt is called the March for Life for a reason ; the \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With Various Exceptions \u201d doesn \u2019 t have the same ring to it .\nIn addition to debating the merits of total abortion bans versus incremental restrictions , other divisive issues within the GOP\u2014such as family-policy measures like paid family leave\u2014won \u2019 t necessarily become less divisive just because one faction claims them necessary to create a better post-Roe world .\nThe emergence of divisions in

Post-Roe World", "content": "The leaked draft of the majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women \u2019 s Health Organization signals that Roe and Casey are likely to be overruled in the coming months .\nThis leak has sparked a range of political debates , from the effect it will have on the midterm elections , to the implications of the leak itself , to the next steps for abortion law .\nOn the latter point , many on the right are breathing a sigh of relief that the issue of abortion can finally go \u201c back to the states.\n\u201d Even pro-abortion advocates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roe made abortion a constitutional right despite the following realities : Abortion is not a right mentioned or implied in the Constitution , there was no history in this nation of protecting abortion as a right , and the United States has a long history of laws prohibiting abortion .\nIf the Supreme Court does in fact overrule Roe and Casey , it will be a good and healthy thing for the republic for moral , legal , and political reasons .\nThe question , though , is who decidesabortion policy if and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casey ?\nDoes abortion policy simply return to the states ?\nOr does Congress potentially have a role to play in abortion legislation in a post-Roe America ?\nAssuming the final decision in Dobbs does indeed overrule Roe and Casey , it is important to briefly summarize the facts and legal implications of the Dobbs case itself .\nIn 2018 , Mississippi passed a state law banning nearly all abortions after 15 weeks .\nAn abortion facility in Mississippi filed a lawsuit claiming the state did not provide evidence that unborn children are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court precedent prohibits states from banning abortion prior to fetal viability , the lawsuit claims that the state law conflicts with current Supreme Court precedent .\nTherefore , they argued , the Mississippi law is unconstitutional .\nIf the Court \u2019 s final decision in Dobbs overrules Roe and Casey , its reasoning will be that while the Mississippi statute is indeed in conflict with Supreme Court precedent , the statute can stand , because the previous Supreme Court precedent is erroneous and therefore must be overruled .\nIt is crucial to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily \u201c send the issue back to the states.\n\u201d It would merely hold that the enshrining of abortion as a constitutional right was legally incorrect and is therefore overruled .\nConservatives must not conclude that abortion must inevitably become an issue for the states if Roe and Casey fall .\nWhile it is true that abortion would go back to the legislatures , there will be nothing in the Dobbs decision , and nothing in the United States Constitution , that precludes Congress from considering and passing pro-life legislation .\nIf Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abortion issue , there are at least two areas of the Constitution that give them grounds to try to do so : the 14th Amendment and the Commerce Clause .\nThe 14th Amendment to the Constitution , ratified in 1868 , was passed primarily to ensure that no state could deny a particular class of persons \u201c equal protection of the laws \u201d or \u201c deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law.\n\u201d The Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African-American slaves from legal discrimination at the state level .\nBut subsequent legal decisions as well as a common-sense reading of the amendment \u2019 s text make it clear that these sections of the 14th Amendment protect \u201c any person , \u201d not one particular class of persons .\nImportantly , the 14th Amendment is not merely the expression of an ideal ; it has teeth .\nThe final section of the 14th Amendment provides that \u201c Congress shall have power to enforce , by appropriate legislation , the provisions of this article.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple .\nAny person is protected by the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the 14th Amendment .\nModern science provides ample reasons to believe that the unborn child in its mother \u2019 s womb is a human being , a person .\nTherefore , no state can deny an unborn child in its mother \u2019 s womb the equal protection of the laws , or deny that child of life , liberty , or property without due process of law .\nIf the Supreme Court ever rules that this language applies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutionally prohibited .\nThis argument was made to the Court in Roe and was acknowledged and dismissed by Justice Blackmun .\nIn the absence of such a court ruling , however , the 14th Amendment still gives to Congress the express power to make laws to enforce these protections .\nA pro-life Congress could pass legislation invoking the 14th Amendment , declaring that at a certain point ( be it conception , implantation , or detection of a heartbeat ) , an unborn child is a person , and therefore can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws .\nSuch a law would certainly be subject to legal challenge in the courts , and there is no shortage of pro-abortion advocates who would be willing to take up such a cause .\nStill , a pro-life Congress would have the legitimate option to use its enforcement power under the 14th Amendment in this way if it wished .\nApart from 14th Amendment-enforcement legislation , Congress could enact abortion legislation via the Commerce Clause .\nArticle I , Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power \u201c to regulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past abuses of this clause aside , the commerce power is explicit in the Constitution .\nCongress has express authority to regulate any kind of commercial activity that crosses state lines .\nIf Roe is overruled and states begin to pass abortion legislation , inevitably there will be instances of abortion being restricted in one state and accessible in a neighboring state .\nCongress could pass legislation prohibiting someone from crossing state lines in order to have an abortion in certain circumstances .\nIn particular , Congress could prohibit an adult from taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minor procure an abortion .\nGiven concerns about sex traffickers regularly transporting their victims to receive abortions , the latter proposal ought at least to be considered .\nThere have already been attempts by conservative states to prevent their residents from procuring abortions in other states where the practice remains legal .\nThose state laws will be challenged under the Dormant Commerce Clause doctrine , which basically holds that the Commerce Clause implicitly prevents states from passing laws that affect interstate commerce .\nThis tension will lead to an interesting legal question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clause grant Congress the authority to regulate interstate access to abortion ?\nDoes the Dormant Commerce Clause preclude states from prohibiting their residents from crossing state lines to procure an abortion ?\nThese questions need to be discussed , debated , and , in all likelihood , addressed by the courts .\nThe above arguments only suggest that Congress has the authority to regulate abortion , not the requirement to do so .\nThere are prominent voices within the Republican Party who are willing to consider federal pro-life legislation .\nThere are others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an issue for states to decide .\nBut assuming the Dobbs decision does indeed overrule Roe and Casey , pro-life conservatives should know that there is a legitimate case for federal legislation against abortion .\nRepublican federal lawmakers should have a real discussion on this issue and consider all the options at hand , rather than punt on the grounds that it is inherently \u201c an issue for the states.\n\u201d If Roe falls , many ( if not all ) states will likely consider and pass some kind of abortion legislation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the movement against Roe and the abortion regime is , at its center , about the protection of innocent lives , not the inappropriate exercise of \u201c raw judicial power.\n\u201d So while overruling Roe would be a great achievement both for the rule of law and the pro-life movement , conservatives must remember that their overarching goal is to stop abortions , not simply to send the issue back to the states .\nFor years , Republicans have been elected to federal office claiming to be boldly pro-life .\nOnce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will likely have a constitutional basis to put that pro-life position into practice if they choose to do so .\nIt will be interesting to see how conservatives in Congress react .\nSome will push for aggressive pro-life legislation , while others will insist that this ought to be decided at the state level .\nThe conversation must be allowed to play out .\nConservatives must acknowledge that there is a constitutional basis for passing pro-life federal legislation .\nIf they choose to let it be decided solely by state legislatures , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a choice , not an inevitability .\nFrank DeVito is an attorney and a current fellow

the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act in 2017 in an attempt to end it .\nA similar bill was introduced in the Senate but failed to pass .\nUnder the Obama Justice Department , corporate fines were directed to organizations including the Sierra Club , the National Community Reinvestment Coalition , and the National Council of La Raza .\nThrough arrangements known as Supplemental Environmental Projects ( SEPs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fines reduced if they paid money to organizations that , although not victims in the DOJ suit , were nonetheless approved as beneficiaries .\nIn addition to reducing fines , these arrangements also gave penalized companies a tax deduction for their charitable contributions , which bought corporate support for the practice and prevented legal challenges .\nThere were hundreds of such arrangements under the Obama administration .\nThe most notable cases include Volkswagen \u2019 s settlement of its emissions cheating scandal , which included a requirement that VW spend $ 2 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama administration had twice requested these funds from Congress and been denied , so it used the VW settlement to fund the project instead .\nOf the $ 2 billion that VW paid , $ 800 million went to the state of California .\nSettlements with Wall Street banks after the mortgage crisis also featured payments to progressive groups that were favored by Obama \u2019 s DOJ .\nA 2017 congressional hearing revealed internal DOJ memos regarding these settlements , one of which was addressed to then-Associate Attorney General Tony West , asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best way to allocate some money to an organization of our choosing ?\n\u201d Another DOJ email stated that the settlement with Citibank , which included third-party payments , should \u201c not allow Citi to pick a statewide intermediary like the Pacific Legal Foundation , \u201d which the official said \u201c does conservative property-rights free legal services.\n\u201d The report further noted that \u201c federal grants come with a litany of rules and procedures designed to ensure that funds are used as intended.\u2026 Such controls are entirely absent in DOJ \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no provision to track where the funds went , how they were being used , or if they achieved the goals the DOJ intended when arranging the payments .\nThe DOJ itself was not forthcoming with information regarding these payments .\nAlthough the congressional investigation began in November 2014 , the report noted that \u201c for over a year , DOJ provided none of the requested internal communications pertaining to the controversial settlement provisions.\n\u201d The House Judiciary Committee , however , obtained emails from the president of one of the organizations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Association of Interest On Lawyer Trust Accounts ( IOLTA ) Programs , stating , \u201c I would like to discuss ways we might want to recognize and show appreciation for the Department of Justice and specifically Associate Attorney General Tony West , who by all accounts was the one person most responsible for including the IOLTA provisions [ in the settlement ] .\n\u201d In response , the executive director of the Hawaii Legal Aid Foundation , another recipient , wrote that he \u201c would be willing to have us build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could bow down to this statue each day after we get our $ 200,000.\n\u201d In order to stop this practice , in June 2017 then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions enacted what has become known as the \u201c Sessions Rule , \u201d prohibiting third-party settlements at the DOJ .\nImmediately upon assuming office in January 2021 , however , President Biden directed his administration to review this rule , which his DOJ has now rescinded .\n\u201c The fact that they \u2019 re spending resources on getting rid of an anti-corruption regulation shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption that the regulation was intended to prevent , \u201d said Ted Frank , senior attorney at the Hamilton Lincoln Law Institute .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a good way to avoid voter accountability , and it gives power to the DOJ that Congress didn \u2019 t give them .\nThey can direct hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars to pet causes.\n\u201d Not only do these settlements \u201c disrespect the Constitutional process in a way that is anti-democratic , \u201d said Michael Buschbacher , a former DOJ attorney who drafted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s also bad environmental policy .\nThe way Congress set things up with the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act , the penalties for violating these statutes are enormous .\nThe goal there is designed as this massive deterrent , and what SEPs do is radically undercut that deterrence because penalties get dramatically reduced to pay for these projects.\n\u201d Buschbacher also pointed out the potential for corruption in this practice .\n\u201c It discredits the government and law enforcement as faithful agents in enforcing the law and doing what \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the illegitimate end of rewarding one \u2019 s friends and punishing one \u2019 s enemies.\n\u201d When Garland announced his decision to revoke the Sessions Rule , he also declared that his DOJ would prioritize the pursuit of \u201c environmental justice.\n\u201d This statement coincided with a new ruling by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) that it would require all publicly traded companies to file extensive public reports on their carbon emissions and other climate-related data .\nTaken together , these and other actions by the Biden Administration signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bringing environmental suits against companies , with less restraint or oversight over where those proceeds go or how they are used .\n\u201c It creates an incentive to engage in prosecutions , \u201d Frank said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s one thing if the money is going to the Treasury through the democratic process .\nThat \u2019 s a lot less exciting than if you prosecute somebody and the money is going to your favorite pet cause.\n\u201d \u201c I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s lost on anyone that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] announced the policy , he suggests that environmental justice is one of the things they \u2019 re going to be taking on , \u201d said William Yeatman , a research fellow at the Cato Institute .\n\u201c They \u2019 ve tipped their hand with respect to which groups can expect to benefit .\nThe only limit , unless Congress gets involved , is restraint by the President or by the Justice Department , and that \u2019 s in short supply.\n\u201d Garland \u2019 s memo on third-party settlements stated that \u201c when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government to more fully compensate victims , remedy harm and punish and deter future violations.\n\u201d The Sessions Rule , the memo states , \u201c is more restrictive and less tailored than necessary to address concerns that these agreements could be used to inappropriately fund projects unrelated to the harm involved in the matter.\n\u201d Garland \u2019 s new policy includes provisions that the DOJ \u201c shall not propose the selection of any particular third party to receive payments\u2026although the Department may specify the type of entity , \u201d and the DOJ \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or beneficiary.\n\u201d In addition , a senior DOJ official must approve third-party settlements .\nBut these provisions may fail to reassure those who are skeptical about the legality and legitimacy of reviving the Obama-era settlement policies .\nA spokesperson for Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama , the Republican who introduced the Senate \u2019 s Stop Settlements Slush Funds Act , stated \u201c AG Garland \u2019 s memo rightfully recognized the practice under the Obama administration was flawed , but failed to recognize that Congress alone has the ability to direct federal funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a settlement .\nAG Garland \u2019 s policy is still an example of executive overreach .\nSettlement funds should go first to the victims , and then the Treasury .\nFunds should not go to a third party and be used to advance a political agenda.\n\u201d \u201c There needs to be Congressional oversight on this , \u201d Frank said .\n\u201c There needs to be [ Freedom of Information Act ] requests , there needs to be somebody figuring out where this money is going.\n\u201d \u201c I think the scrutiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep them from doing some of the ridiculous stuff they did last time , \u201d Buschbacher said , \u201c but on the main , this is likely to be a return to the approach under President Obama .\nOne of his key DOJ attorneys involved in these kinds of settlements , Vanita Gupta , has returned for a second tour .\nNow she \u2019 s the number three attorney in the Department and will have final decision-making authority over many of these settlements.\n\u201d The Department of Justice was asked to comment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin Stocklin is

.\nSpecial Counsel John Durham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the FBI and committing perjury .\nSussmann claimed he was not working for a client when he was , in fact , surreptitiously representing the Clinton

actions .\nHere \u2019 s the new timeline of events , revealing the \u201c why \u201d behind the timing of Russiagate : On July 5 , 2016 , FBI Director James Comey issued a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing in connection with her private email server .\nThat removed what was thought to be her last major hurdle to nomination .\nThen , Wikileaks released information taken from the DNC servers which showed , interalia , the Clinton campaign \u2019 s efforts to disparage Bernie Sanders .\nThe leaks broke during the Democratic Convention ( July 25 to 28 ) and threatened to split the party .\nIt was crisis time for Democrats .\nConcurrent with the Wikileaks disclosure and the sense of panic inside the campaign at the 2016 Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin the Russiagate dirty tricks campaign ( as Mook testified to , Smoking Gun One ) .\nThat is the specific \u201c why \u201d behind the timing of the Russiagate narrative .\nOn July 28 , 2016 , CIA Director John Brennan briefed President Obama on Hillary Clinton \u2019 s plan to tie candidate Trump to Russia as a means of distracting the public ( Smoking Gun Two ) .\nWhy Brennan , from CIA , was briefing Obama on internal Democratic Party strategy is unclear .\nHowever , a highly redacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting additional insight into Russian activities from [ REDACTED ] .\nCite alleged approved by Hillary Clinton on July 26 a proposal from one of her foreign policy advisers to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.\n\u201d The FBI then opened its omnibus investigation into all things Trump-Russia , Crossfire Hurricane , on July 31 , 2016 , a Sunday , coincidentally only days after Clinton initially approved the dirty-tricks campaign and just as the Democratic convention ended with Clinton \u2019 s nomination .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of information about Trump campaign member George Papadopoulos relayed to investigators by an Australian diplomat .\nMany believe the timing of the investigation suggests it was actually based the Clinton campaign \u2019 s disclosures of the Steele dossier to the FBI , not diplomatic gossip about Papadopoulos .\nSteele himself ran the dossier data to the FBI and media the same way Sussmann ran the Alfa Bank data to the FBI and media , claiming no link to the Clinton campaign .\nBrennan may have been personally tipped off by Jake Sullivan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisor and the most likely \u201c foreign-policy advisor \u201d inside the Clinton campaign to have run the Russiagate caper .\nAs CIA Director , Brennan briefed Obama on Clinton \u2019 s July 26 sign-off on the dirty-tricks campaign .\nHis own agency would not come to the same conclusions until September 2016 , when it forwarded to the FBI an investigative referral about Hillary Clinton .\nIf not for a tip-off , then how did Brennan , always a public Hillary supporter , know before his agency did ?\nAiming for an October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in late October , early enough to influence the election but too late for the opposition to effectively rebut ) , Sussmann then met with FBI attorney James Baker ( now working at Twitter ) to lay out the Alfa Bank and smartphone story on September 18 , 2016 .\nThe FBI ( via fraud ) on October 21 obtained the first FISA warrant against a Trump team member .\nAnd following a press release by Jake Sullivan , Hillary tweeted on October 31 , 2016 , that Trump had a secret server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nShe knew her campaign paid to create that information and push it into the public eye via Sussmann and a woman named Laura Seago .\nSeago was an analyst at Fusion GPS , the organization that commissioned the infamous Steele dossier on behalf of Clinton .\nSeago testified at the Sussmann trial that she and others went to journalist Franklin Foer \u2019 s house to pitch the story , telling him it had been vetted by \u201c highly credible computer scientists \u201d who \u201c seemed to think these allegations were credible.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31 , 2016 , timed with Sullivan \u2019 s statement and Hillary \u2019 s tweet suggesting the server connecting Trump with Alfa Bank was used as a clandestine-communications tool .\nThe story stated \u201c the knee was hit in Moscow , the leg kicked in New York.\n\u201d Clearer ?\nComey cleared Clinton of legal trouble over her emails .\nThe last barrier to nomination was thought to have been breached .\nThen WikiLeaks disclosures threatened to derail the convention .\nSomething else was needed .\nHillary signed off on the Russiagate dirty-tricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later , the FBI opened Crossfire Hurricane based on either flimsy foreign gossip or the Clinton paid-for Steele dossier .\nHillary and Sullivan timed their disclosures with the media making near-identical claims .\nSo does all this matter ?\nYes .\n\u201c The trial is the vehicle Durham is using to help bring out the truth , to tell a story of a political campaign that in two instances pursued information that was totally fabricated\u2026 to mislead the American voter , \u201d said Kevin Brock , the FBI \u2019 s former assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that if nothing else , Hillary Clinton herself was personally the start and the end of Russiagate \u2019 s false story .\nAs dirty tricks go , this was a helluva tale to sell to a gullible public and a

defamation .\nAnd Jake Sullivan , Biden \u2019 s active national-security advisor , played a still-hidden role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of president would Hillary have made if she was willing to lie like this to get elected ?\nShe is all appetite , still active in her party , and still a dangerous animal .\nThe spiteful Clinton still maintains that Trump has ties to Russia and , through surrogates , kept Russiagate alive to defang the Trump administration even after she lost the election .\nThe real insurrection\u2014the fact that Russiagate did not end with Trump \u2019 s victory\u2014is chilling .\nComey and Brennan repurposed the false information from a campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they dangled in front of Robert Mueller for three years in hopes he would stumble on to something illegal once he exercised his powers as special prosecutor .\nThis was a coup attempt against a sitting president .\nMeanwhile , Twitter has still not removed the Clinton and Sullivan Russiagate tweets from 2016 nor marked them as \u201c disinformation.\n\u201d That silence allows the lie a second life , which is important , because Trump is almost certainly going to run for president again , and polls show almost half of Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is easy enough to still say \u201c so what ?\n\u201d Most people who did not support Hillary Clinton long ago concluded that she is a liar and untrustworthy .\nHer supporters know she \u2019 ll never run for public office again , hence the sense of anti-climax .\nWhat matters in the end is less the details of Hillary \u2019 s lie than that as someone close to being elected as her would lie about such a thing , treason , claiming her opponent was working for Russia against the interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would soon swear an oath .\nThis week \u2019 s revelations and the way they fill in \u201c motive \u201d in the timeline are bombshells , if you blow the smoke away .\nNo doubt that , in many minds , Clinton \u2019 s manipulations are measured alongside Trump \u2019 s transgressions , \u201c whataboutism.\n\u201d Those who think that way may have missed the day in kindergarten when everyone else was taught how two wrongs don \u2019

money printing appeared to be numbered .\nBiden \u2019 s own contributions to the national-debt crisis\u2014the $ 1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan , subsequent attempts to pass an even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his desire for student-loan forgiveness\u2014have certainly aggravated that problem , but were not its only causes .\nFor far too long , our leaders in Washington have gambled that the U.S. economic system could withstand an ever-widening disconnect between spending and revenues without experiencing persistent inflation .\nNow , sadly for Biden , the gamble has proved a failure .\nFrom here on , both the president and Congress will be pressured to restore some fiscal balance .\nBeyond the public \u2019 s anger over inflation , the accompanying rise in interest rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwarf every other federal expenditure , will only make their task more urgent .\nBridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio has outlined an approach to solving this problem in his exhaustive study of the history of sovereign debt crises , appropriately titled Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises ( 2018 ) .\nAs Dalio emphasized , the first and most important of these principles is that no nation emerges from a severe overspending problem without its major political factions agreeing to sacrifice for the greater good .\nAfter a lot of initial yelling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must either share in the required pain or sink together into the chaos of an economic collapse .\nFor their part , Republicans and conservatives will almost certainly have to accept some form of means-testing for the country \u2019 s two biggest entitlement programs , Social Security and Medicare .\nThe right will also have to agree to a reduction in farm subsidies and policies that favor the affluent .\nWhile increasing taxes on the private sector would , in the end , only diminish what it can contribute to the federal treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently gets from government would not have that effect .\nUnfortunately for Democrats and progressives , their sacrifice will have to be as much structural as economic .\nThe poor performance of so many progressive-favored government programs over the years has convinced voters that those employed to deliver public services are profiting far more from those programs \u2019 operation than the supposed beneficiaries .\nAs Larry Summers himself said of federal education policy in a recent Politico forum with Dalio , \u201c Of course , there \u2019 s always the question : if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , does it come out in the form of more education for more kids or more administrators ( and ) more comfortable lives for those in the existing system ?\n\u201d As long as the bill for these perceived government inefficiencies seemed chargeable to a distant future , taxpayers tended to ignore the size of the bill .\nEven after 2014 , when the Heritage Foundation put the total spent on President Lyndon Johnson \u2019 s failed War on Poverty at $ 22 trillion dollars\u2014more than two-thirds the current federal debt\u2014there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective .\nBut as it becomes clear that taxpayers themselves must pick up the tab for bureaucratic wastefulness , it will be impossible to resist the demand for a rigorous performance review of every federal agency and publicly subsidized service .\nPerhaps in anticipation of such demands , the U.S. Government Accountability Office has already prepared a continuously updated list of the 34 programs that most obviously \u201c need broad reform.\n\u201d Which brings us back to Biden \u2019 s tax obsession .\nFor a president whose base contains many people employed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency that would have to be part of any bipartisan debt deal is not a happy prospect .\nNegotiating with Republicans will likely prove a cakewalk compared to wrangling his allies in public-sector unions and other left-wing interest groups .\nIndeed , it is not a coincidence that Democrats have been seen as a party without a top-notch bench of presidential and congressional candidates .\nConventional wisdom holds that progressive activists have outfoxed liberals for control of the party , but it may be more likely that potentially successful Democrat candidates don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s coming internal convulsions .\nSince Biden is unable or unwilling to persuade Democratic voters in the public sector to sacrifice their employment advantages for the sake of the nation \u2019 s economic future , his strategy has been to deflect blame for his and his party \u2019 s role in creating the debt crisis .\nBy harping on \u201c unfairly low tax rates , \u201d he has identified a cause that can be easily demagogued .\nWhether Biden himself is the author of this dishonest strategy or is being prompted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , given the widespread doubts about his mental competence .\nIf Democrats like Larry Summers and Jason Furman have been able to understand the country \u2019 s financial problems , many of the president \u2019 s own advisors must certainly be aware of the need to manage the looming acrimony within their own party .\nRegardless of who is behind the calls for \u201c tax fairness , \u201d the more Biden is forced to negotiate spending cuts and reforms , the more we are all going to hear about an \u201c urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both sides of the aisle hope

get Mexico City \u2019 s attention\u2014only lifting restrictions to reward collaboration .\nEnsconced in their gargantuan metropolis far south of the border , leaders in Mexico City have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their northern frontier as long as trade gets through .\nFor them , breaking the border cartels is as equally low importance as capturing Pancho Villa was a century ago .\nWhen officials do speak about border issues , their emphasis is typically economic , seeking more opportunities for maquiladora industries or expanded trade infrastructure to transport more cargo north .\nMeanwhile , cartels and their agents act with impunity , spreading their corrupting cancer into all aspects of frontier life , including legitimate businesses , political parties , local governments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTheir reach is staggering : They censor local press and media ; squeeze profits out of power , oil , and water companies ; and even control human rights NGOs .\nThis menace is loose across all Mexico , but cartels uniquely exploit the vulnerabilities of the border region to penetrate the U.S. homeland .\nMexico City could do much more , beginning by providing more security funding and ending the political favoritism that influences how resources are allocated .\nBesieged border-state governors are often forced to pay for federal responsibilities .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the state of Coahuila is required to finance the bivouacking of the Mexican army along the Rio Bravo .\nThe state of Nuevo Leon receives woefully inadequate federal assistance to secure the main highway between the major city of Monterrey and the U.S. border .\nThe entire state of Tamaulipas , home to multiple strategic routes into Texas , is the classic example of a failed narco-state within Mexico : an unacceptable situation that Mexican federal authorities have tolerated for years , making only half-hearted efforts to reclaim the strategic trade city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial roads leading directly to the Laredo , Texas , cargo bridges .\nOpponents may argue that a border-closing strategy would unfairly hurt American consumers and legitimate businesses , but they decline to grapple with the unsettling fact that Mexican cartels also profit from legal trade into the United States .\nThe cartels are rightly branded \u201c transnational criminal organizations \u201d ( TCOs ) because they do much more than smuggle migrants and narcotics .\nLegitimate Mexican customs brokers and shippers , who transport around $ 1.7 billion in goods and products daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on vehicles crossing bridges in Laredo , Texas ) , are forced to pay vast sums to TCOs for \u201c protection and facilitation.\n\u201d Nobody knows how much the TCOs extort out of lawful commerce , but it is surely

local market .\nIf Americans rightly refuse goods assembled by slave labor , what should U.S. policy be in accepting products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after paying off brutal TCOs ?\nWhen it comes to the region \u2019 s social and cultural life , cartel violence long ago effectively closed the border for Americans living on the frontier , including those with family on both sides , who simply stopped crossing into Mexico for fear of rampant crime .\nIndeed , the State Department officially urges all Americans to avoid Mexico \u2019 s frontier communities , from Matamoros to Ciudad Juarez to Tijuana .\nAmericans now tend to fly directly to Mexico \u2019 s tourist attractions .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by Mexicans .\nNo one seeks to impose undue hardship on the vast majority of our Mexican neighbors , who are simply trying to survive in a brutal region .\nHowever , their state and federal governments have abandoned them to border violence and lawlessness , as they must constantly navigate through cartels and corrupt officials .\nPressure from Washington by way of strategic border closings would offer them the hope of future improvement .\nAbove all , we must convince Mexico to station significantly more military assets in vulnerable border areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professionals , the Mexican army ( SEDENA ) and navy-marines ( SEMAR ) , are the country \u2019 s best large-scale security force .\nThe military is not a policing force , but it does provide critical internal security needed for officials to carry out their duties .\nNo serious observer expects SEDENA and SEMAR to break the powerful cartels , but the military has been effective in putting TCO armed militants on the defensive .\nMore Mexican military firepower is required to retake and hold numerous border transportation routes and strategic urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaza \u201d in Mexican parlance .\nTroop deployment , however , is inadequate for the mission .\nCurrently , the vast majority of Mexico \u2019 s armed services , for political reasons , are garrisoned in the capital area , as Mexico \u2019 s elite leadership views the messy border as somewhere between a non-priority and dangerous backwater .\nSenior military officers seek to avoid a border tour of duty as not career-enhancing .\nA rigorous U.S. border-leverage policy could help establish a new political calculus in Mexico City .\nYes , Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and institutional corruption , significant weaknesses that undermine the country \u2019 s capacity to be a partner .\nBut it can also deploy high-quality , well-trained government personnel .\nMexico \u2019 s federal tax collection authority ( SAT ) and the national intelligence service ( CNI , formerly CISEN ) are top-notch professionals .\nThe country \u2019 s diplomats are world class .\nWhen it comes to the frontier , however , Mexican state and local authorities are unreliable , and the federal border services need better leadership and training .\nAll are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The military alone can best stabilize this operating environment .\nA border-closing strategy should push for more U.S.-Mexican joint security operations along the frontier , which currently are very rare .\nLack of mutual trust and corruption are of course impediments to overcome , but the Mexican military can be an effective partner .\nWashington needs to persuade a reluctant AMLO that such collaboration is fundamental for the region to reduce the dominance of criminality .\nOther underutilized assets are the five U.S. border consulates located in Tijuana , Nogales , Juarez , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic facilities have been modernized and would provide excellent forward cooperation platforms ; yet without sufficient Mexican military troops to secure these border cities , the operating environments are too dangerous .\nInstead of being effective platforms for law enforcement collaboration , the consulates serve mainly to process visas for travelers , a Mexican priority that does nothing to promote security .\nIn developing an effective border-closing strategy , we must guard against its reduction by the State Department and DHS to the much-ballyhooed \u201c 21st Century Border \u201d program , which focuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and clear commercial cargo and travelers .\nThis technology has its place , but it should not distract from a policy of directly engaging the Mexican leadership to deploy reliable armed forces and security personnel .\nOn the U.S. side , Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) has the daunting task of checking both cargo and travelers , and the agency does admirable work despite Washington \u2019 s weak leadership .\nA few years ago , State and DHS pulled back from a pilot U.S.-Mexican initiative to station armed CBP officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expedite cargo checks , because Mexico City refused to dedicate security forces to protect the pre-check zones from cartel interference .\nA U.S. border-leverage strategy would likely have turned around Mexico City \u2019 s short-sighted unwillingness to act in its own national interest .\nMexican officials constantly tell Washington that their biggest border-security request is to stop the flow of U.S.-made weapons moving south .\nIt is the Mexican version of our complaint about narcotics and illegal migrants .\nInterdicting these weapons requires better border vigilance .\nPerhaps deft U.S. border-closing diplomacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City than its critics think .\nA flexible border-closing policy is more effective and less costly than building a wall .\nThere are certainly frontier areas where physical barriers have been or would be needed impediments to clandestine crossings , but making the wall the heart of our Mexico security engagement is a Maginot Line strategy that surrenders the initiative to our enemies .\nU.S. national security deserves not a bunker mentality but an active forward defense , not nation-building , but a realpolitik that persuades our southern neighbor to better mobilize , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security personnel at the border .\nYes , Mexico is a very difficult dance partner for Uncle Sam , but smart diplomacy can bring more out of her .\nPhillip Linderman ,

constant failure to pass these elusive \u201c sensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of unsuccessful , stymied legislative efforts .\nPerhaps the existence of the Second Amendment , and a United States Supreme Court willing to uphold it , are the real issues for the left .\nWhile voices on the left push many false claims about the text and meaning of the Second Amendment , two in particular deserve mention .\nFirst , one cliche always seems to circulate after these tragedies .\nIt goes something like : \u201c The Second Amendment says it is necessary to have a well-regulated militia .\nSo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear arms for militia members , not ordinary civilians.\n\u201d It is always uttered as if it is an original thought that has never been considered .\nBut it has been considered .\nAnd , as the majority opinion penned by Justice Scalia in D.C. v. Heller in 2008 observed , the claim suffers from both a grammatical error and a historical one .\nIn the text of the Second Amendment , \u201c A well regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , \u201d constitutes the preface .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all .\nA prefatory clause may give you the reason a writer has in mind for the clause that follows , but it does not limit what comes next .\nFor example , if there were a rule that \u201c Proper decorum being necessary in church , the right of the people to wear fine dresses and suits shall not be infringed , \u201d this would in no way limit the right to wear fine clothes to church-goers or to Sunday .\nThe right to wear fine clothes would be the operative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part announces the purpose , but the purpose is not a limit .\nIf the Second Amendment read \u201c The right of the people to keep and bear arms so that they can form a well-regulated militia shall not be infringed , \u201d the conversation would be different , since purpose ( forming the militia ) would be tied to the right itself .\nBut the language of the actual Second Amendment simply does not allow such a reading .\nThen there is the historical issue with the definition of a militia here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opine that the militia refers to some kind of military force , or , at least , a state or local quasi-military force\u2014something like the national guard or local police department today .\nIf we have organized police forces and standing armies protecting us , they ask , isn \u2019 t the whole \u201c militia \u201d thing obsolete ?\nThe answer ought to be a resounding \u201c No !\n\u201d Justice Scalia \u2019 s opinion in Heller takes a deep dive into the historical context .\nIn short , the \u201c militia \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of acting for the common defense , and was decidedly not a standing military .\nIn fact , the Antifederalists at the time of the American Founding wanted the Second Amendment in place because they feared that the government would disarm the people and allow a standing army or select government-run militia to displace an armed populace .\nThe citizen militia identified in the Second Amendment is meant to ensure that the people , and not government forces alone , are armed .\nWe should also address the asinine idea that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flintlock pistols of the 18th century and would not have covered \u201c weapons of war \u201d then or supposed \u201c assault rifles \u201d today .\nPresident Biden has repeatedly and falsely stated that the Second Amendment initially limited who could own a gun and what type of weapon one could own .\nThis is clearly not true ; it appears there was no law preventing 18th-century American civilians from owning a cannon after all .\nThe Second Amendment itself places no limits on gun ownership , and there was no federal legislation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rights was passed .\nWhile the Second Amendment itself does not in any way limit firearm rights , most scholars concede , as did the majority opinion in Heller , that the right to bear arms is not absolute .\nIf there is at least some room to regulate the details of when , where , and how the people may keep and bear arms , one key aspect of the discussion in Heller must be remembered .\nThe Heller opinion restates a principle previously articulated in a Supreme Court case called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weapons protected by the Second Amendment are particularly those \u201c in common use at the time.\n\u201d Yes , in the 1790s , that was probably the musket and flintlock pistol .\nBut what are the weapons \u201c in common use \u201d that warrant the particular protection of the Second Amendment today ?\nHandguns are the most commonly owned type of firearm ;

governmental defaults have occurred when the ratio was below 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 our debt-to-GDP ratio hit 100 percent .\nClearly , it is time for our leaders to take notice .\nThey must explain the danger and take action .\nAmazingly , in 2020 we spent $ 6.6 trillion after collecting $ 3.4 trillion in tax revenues\u2014so , more than $ 19 went out for every $ 10 that came in .\nOver the last

"content": "The Heian period of Japanese history saw the slow shriveling of imperial rule .\nOvershadowed by powerful court families and hostage to palace intrigues and a generally effete highbrow culture ( princes in those days cried a lot , and weren \u2019 t ashamed to write girly poems about their feelings ) , the Heian capital lost interest in , and then control of , the hinterlands .\nThe source of the trouble was a military detachment that Emperor Kanmu , who founded the Heian capital in 794 , had sent to the Far North , which thereafter lingered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Kanmu had played up the \u201c Far North \u201d bit and sent the toughs as far away from the center as possible just to keep them from meddling in government affairs .\nIn any event , what began as an emperor-centered polity in Heian-ky\u014d devolved into ruder rule by spear and bicep .\nAs the imperial center waned , the semi-unemployed platoons whose forebears had once laid waste to the Northern barbarians began to tax the surrounding provinces for their own benefit .\nBecause , honestly , why ride a thousand miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unarmed suckers right next door ?\nIt was becoming martial law without civilian control .\nOver time , local strongmen , at first hired to guard farms and estates from these half-deputized , half-freelancing , quasi-ministerial marauders , got an idea .\n\u201c We have a lot of weapons , \u201d the strongmen bethought themselves .\n\u201c So why are we carrying on with the fiction of answering to the roving bands , who themselves have pretty much dropped the charade of answering to the schmucks in the capital in the flowing silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ samurai , the men who realized they were the real government .\nFlip that switch , dear reader , and it \u2019 s lights out .\nPower sorts itself out , and there is really no confusion , among those in the know , about who calls the shots .\nThe episode above unfolded between roughly the time of Charlamagne and the Third Crusade .\nBut the same thing , mutatis mutandis , has played out in our own time .\nOnly it \u2019 s not the military that runs the show any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt used to be that the gods were the keystones of rule .\nThen it was the generals .\nBut as statecraft has become more and more the business of controlling and manipulating information\u2014a process that has moved along slowly , at different paces and by different steps in different places\u2014it has been , increasingly , the spies and secret police who have come to call the shots .\nA long time ago , court historians faked history to support sovereigns .\nNow , court historians write history in advance .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefing.\n\u201d It \u2019 s a map of how the spymasters will the future to unfold

know how our government really works , and we will forever be led around by the nose , from one bloody debacle and canceled civil liberty to the next .\nThe end of the American Heian period came when we started conquering Apaches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home .\nAmerican intelligence grew out of the United States \u2019 s shift from being an agrarian democratic republic to an urbanizing , progressive empire feeding on deficit spending for war .\nA good book on the consequences of this intelligence capture of American government is James Bamford \u2019 s 1983 Puzzle Palace .\nThe book \u2019 s \u201c Prelude \u201d section tells the story of Herbert Osborne Yardley ( 1889-1958 ) , the Indiana man who helped set the United States government onto the fateful course of , as Secretary of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ungentlemanly practice of reading other people \u2019 s mail .\nDuring the First World War , Yardley and his MI-8 ( \u201c MI \u201d standing for \u201c Military Intelligence \u201d ) group helped Washington win the information battle both abroad and at home .\nThe Bill of Rights was the real casualty of that useless conflict .\nWashington used its chokehold on information to maintain the most important monopoly that any government can and must hold : not that on violence , pace Weber , but on violence \u2019 s legitimator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington kept on reading other people \u2019 s mail , especially that of the Japanese , imperial rivals with whom the D.C.-types would tangle in earnest in 1941 .\nThe same Henry Stimson who had chided Yardley for peeping on the enemy became a convert to the cause of espionage .\nAs America went deeper and deeper into its century-long ( and counting ) imperial-war quagmire , intelligence burrowed deeper and deeper into the American governmental soul .\nAfter World War II the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) gave way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis was , in essence , the final coup of the intelligence clan .\nThe military , and Washington in general , was now in the thrall of black ops .\nThe Cold War , Vietnam as an outpost within it , and all the wars since ( can you say \u201c slam dunk on WMD \u201d ? )\nhave been the creatures of intelligence .\nBudgets and budgetary oversight are punchlines in that world .\nQuis custodiet ipsos custodes ?\nNobody , my friends .\nThe money is inexhaustible when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic is bureaucratic to its core .\nHistory is a motley art and the words \u201c always \u201d and \u201c never \u201d are pretty much off limits .\nBut perhaps I can be permitted a sweeping generalization just this once : There are no great men in a bureaucracy .\nThe career bureaucrat is a parasite , always , and never acts but for his own next paycheck , which is a compelling interest inseparable from the ever-expanding income of his department .\nThis is the American intelligence \u201c community \u201d ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrepreneurs \u201d ) in full monty .\nIt is mercenary pencil-pushing , installing and assassinating tinhorn dictators until one makes retirement and can buy a Winnebago .\nOnce you know the secret , then secret service takes on a whole different cast .\nThose who have seen a James Bond movie will know that our hero works on \u201c Her Majesty \u2019 s Secret Service.\n\u201d But does he ?\nOr does the queen do his bidding in the end ?\nBond \u2019

license to kill was a very convenient thing when killing was how one made a living anyway .\nHer Royal Highness is safe in her bed , protected by James Bond on his unpleasant errands abroad .\nSo surely he must be servant , and she master .\nSwitch cultural registers a bit and wade around in the cesspool to test this theory .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bureau of Investigation , James Comey , exonerated , on no authority save his own ego , the Democratic presidential candidate , Hillary R. Clinton , of wrongdoing in the to-do about her secret servers and the e-mails she deleted from when she was running guns and uranium as a side business while secretary of State .\nWell , many said ( including me ) , it seems the FBI is in the tank for the Clintons .\nBut then , in a wild October surprise , Comey reopened the investigation into Hillary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to light that a Hillary aide \u2019 s pervert husband had a mammoth trove of Hillary e-mails on his laptop .\nOuch , that smarts .\nHillary lost .\nSo , did Comey throw the election to Trump ?\nOr did he play it straight and just follow the evidence without fear or favor ?\nThe answer is neither .\nThe answer is that it doesn \u2019 t matter , when you \u2019 re a spy , who wins or loses .\nYou own them all .\nWe now know that Comey \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to run a coup against Trump should he get in the White House .\nThat was their \u201c insurance policy.\n\u201d In fact , when Trump did get in , that is precisely what Comey \u2019 s FBI did .\nBut in October of 2016 , Comey still unconsciously believed Hillary would win .\nHere \u2019 s Comey \u2019 s spin on that moment and those e-mails on the pervert \u2019 s laptop : \u201c [ Hillary is ] going to be elected president and if I hide this from the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment she \u2019 s elected , the moment this comes out.\n\u201d Here \u2019 s the translation : \u201c If Hillary gets in , I own her .\nAnd if she doesn \u2019 t , then in four years I \u2019 ll own her still.\n\u201d Comey had nothing to worry about with Trump .\nHe owned him already .\nHillary had been feeding the FBI fake news about Trump in Russia with delegates from the Prostitutes for Putin club .\nOr something .\nBut so brazen is the game that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide its corruption any longer .\nProstitutes for Putin ?\nWhether we believed that nonsense or not made no difference .\nThe FBI owns us , too .\nComey \u2019 s deputy \u2019 s wife had taken pallets of cash from Hillary \u2019 s top bundler , but nobody with political horse sense was going to say anything about it .\nBecause the spooks run the show .\nThe one thing Comey didn \u2019 t factor in was anybody \u2019 s fighting back .\nTrump did , firing Comey in May of 2017 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make Washington an American town again .\nBut the latter-day samurai won in the end .\nThe eavesdroppers rule the world .\nIt was all too easy .\nOne of the men who used to do Comey \u2019 s job parachuted in , issuing a \u201c report \u201d after conducting an \u201c investigation \u201d on the whole tawdry business , and then doddering off into the sunset while the Bureau waited for the Washington machinery to finish chewing up the first president in modern history who bucked the intelligence regime .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from that little escapade , too .\nJust last week , a Democrat judge rigged a \u201c trial \u201d so that a D.C. jury would have no choice but to exonerate the bottom-feeding Democrat lawyer who fed the FBI the completely false fairy tales about Trump .\nThe FBI has no need to drag this all out any further .\nThe point was proven long ago .\nAnd , besides , after more than 40 years of FISA courts \u2019 rubber-stamping intelligence ops against Americans , why would a bought-and-paid-for judge feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nWho gives up a pension for a fool \u2019 s errand ?\nAs Minamoto no Yoritomo might have said were he Christopher Wray , \u201c Get smart .\nNo matter what it looks like , the fact is I don \u2019 t work for the folks in the long black robes .\nThe folks in the long black robes work for me.\n\u201d This is \u201c intelligence \u201d in the USA .\nThe spooks own Washington .\nIt has been a clich\u00e9 since the days of J.

a man who is never boring cashed in his seventh or eighth life last week .\n\u201c Across the pond , \u201d British Prime Minister Boris Johnson survived a Conservative Party no-confidence vote .\nSeemingly the political version of Dick Cheney or Henry Kissinger , obituaries of Johnson \u2019 s premiership have been pre-written since the day he ascended to office in July 2019 .\nYet he never dies .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s over for \u201c Boris , \u201d has picked up in earnest since the advent of \u201c Partygate.\n\u201d That is , the revelations ( and photos ) of Johnson and his staff repeatedly living it up during the lockdown days of 2020 , even as Johnson \u2019 s government spearheaded a severe crackdown in the face of the Coronavirus .\nIndeed , the virus reportedly almost ( literally ) killed the man himself two springs back , and so no wonder by summer , he wanted to enjoy some Chablis with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scolded others for doing so ) .\nCalls for Johnson \u2019 s head , so to speak , have abated somewhat since Vladimir Putin \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine .\nThe British elite , ever in denial of the Empire \u2019 s end , has been pound for pound more bellicose on the peripherally important theater than their kin in Washington ( though , it should be said , they \u2019 ve hardly matched the Americans Pound Sterling for Pound Sterling . )\nSo , the vote this week had the feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more plausible if it had been held over the winter , before events once again intervened to save Boris Johnson .\nThe result : Johnson\u2014the former London mayor , foreign secretary , Spectator editor and Telegraph columnist\u2014has hung around in the global headlines now for over twenty years , or about as long as the man in the Kremlin he now so bellicosely sets himself against .\n( That wasn \u2019 t enough to stop Johnson from reportedly demanding members of parliament show him their secret ballots in the no-confidence vote\u2026 democracy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rival , French President Emmanuel Macron , is more commonly assailed for his Machiavellian mutability .\nBut it is Boris Johnson who has pulled off the feat of first cheaply attacking Mitt Romney at the Olympics , then consulting with Steve Bannon and allowing himself to be portrayed as a \u201c Trumpian natonalist , \u201d then pledging with Joe Biden to \u201c build back better , \u201d all in the span of ten years .\nAs the battle for Ukraine has shown , Johnson \u2019 s reflexive militarism is a clear enough core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister \u2019 s Telegraph archive tells the same story .\nJohnson has long agreed with his on-again , off-again friend , British M.P .\nMichael Gove ( who had to be restrained in August 2013 when the British passed on a round of Middle East airstrikes ) about the need to \u201c do something \u201d whether it be in Syria , or Iraq , or the Donbass .\nAnd it certainly fits the scribbler-statesman \u2019 s plain desire to be seen as a latter-day Churchill .\nAt the very least , Johnson has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poverty , as of course did Britain \u2019 s wartime leader .\nAlthough in Johnson \u2019 s case , it appears the hold on the bank account is more alimony than ascots , more indeterminate number of children than Pol Roger champagne .\nBut this writer \u2019 s fusillade is mere set-up .\nDespite headlines to the contrary , one can see a more plausible path today for Prime Minister Boris Johnson \u2019 s long term political survival than at any time since his smashing 2019 general election victory .\nOn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid out in the Spectator both what I think is the reality of the man , as well as the ludicrous paucity of available alternatives : Johnson biographer Tom Bower has reported that Johnson , at his core , is a loner .\nPerhaps similar to Elon Musk in this way , with the basic exception of his paramour du jour , Johnson \u201c doesn \u2019 t have friends , \u201d says Bower .\nJohnson is a disloyal human being .\nIt \u2019 s a marked contrast from other world leaders , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omerta when it comes to friends and allies .\nIt \u2019 s notably different from predecessors in \u201c Number 10 \u201d like David Cameron .\nAnother interesting morsel in the Bower reportage is that Johnson and his new wife , Conservative operator Carrie Simmons , desire ten years in power .\nThat would put him , in the prime minister \u2019 s mind , in the ranks of Thatcher , Tony Blair , and yes , Churchill , in terms of executive longevity .\nThough there are murmurings of an early election , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an election until December 2024 ( what an autumn that \u2019 s shaping up to be ) , and after that , could serve straight through to 2029 uninterrupted .\nIn addition to differing with Johnson over Ukraine , Henry Kissinger this month indicated that he doubted Johnson \u2019 s overall style of leadership .\nThe old American wiseman credited Johnson with \u201c altering the direction \u201d of British society .\nAnd , surely , an arch-realist can admire a sheer will to power .\nBut Kissinger gestured at the general unease with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as much as the center-right answer to Blair .\nThat is , like Blair , Johnson \u2019 s skills and penchant for survival are not in question .\nWhat is less clear is what anyone else on the planet has to show for his

progressively undermined and overthrown .\nWe see the tradition of independent , self-governed nations as the foundation for restoring a proper public orientation toward patriotism and courage , honor and loyalty , religion and wisdom , congregation and family , man and woman , the sabbath and the sacred , and reason and justice .\nWe are conservatives because we see such virtues as essential to sustaining our civilization .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for recovering and maintaining our freedom , security , and prosperity .\nWe emphasize the idea of the nation because we see a world of independent nations\u2014each pursuing its own national interests and upholding national traditions that are its own\u2014as the only genuine alternative to universalist ideologies now seeking to impose a homogenizing , locality-destroying imperium over the entire globe .\nDrawing on this heritage , we therefore affirm the following principles : 1 .\nNational Independence .\nWe wish to see a world of independent nations .\nEach nation capable of self-government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its own particular constitutional , linguistic , and religious inheritance .\nEach has a right to maintain its own borders and conduct policies that will benefit its own people .\nWe endorse a policy of rearmament by independent self-governing nations and of defensive alliances whose purpose is to deter imperialist aggression .\n2 .\nRejection of Imperialism and Globalism .\nWe support a system of free cooperation and competition among nation-states , working together through trade treaties , defensive alliances , and other common projects that respect the independence of their members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of elected governments to transnational or supranational bodies\u2014a trend that pretends to high moral legitimacy even as it weakens representative government , sows public alienation and distrust , and strengthens the influence of autocratic regimes .\nAccordingly , we reject imperialism in its various contemporary forms : We condemn the imperialism of China , Russia , and other authoritarian powers .\nBut we also oppose the liberal imperialism of the last generation , which sought to gain power , influence , and wealth by dominating other nations and trying to remake them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government .\nThe independent nation-state is instituted to establish a more perfect union among the diverse communities , parties , and regions of a given nation , to provide for their common defense and justice among them , and to secure the general welfare and the blessings of liberty for this time and for future generations .\nWe believe in a strong but limited state , subject to constitutional restraints and a division of powers .\nWe recommend a drastic reduction in the scope of the administrative state and the policy-making judiciary that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation \u2019 s interests and values .\nWe recommend the federalist principle , which prescribes a delegation of power to the respective states or subdivisions of the nation so as to allow greater variation , experimentation , and freedom .\nHowever , in those states or subdivisions in which law and justice have been manifestly corrupted , or in which lawlessness , immorality , and dissolution reign , national government must intervene energetically to restore order .\n4 .\nGod and Public Religion .\nNo nation can long endure without humility and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment that are found in authentic religious tradition .\nFor millennia , the Bible has been our surest guide , nourishing a fitting orientation toward God , to the political traditions of the nation , to public morals , to the defense of the weak , and to the recognition of things rightly regarded as sacred .\nThe Bible should be read as the first among the sources of a shared Western civilization in schools and universities , and as the rightful inheritance of believers and non-believers alike .\nWhere a Christian majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Christianity and its moral vision , which should be honored by the state and other institutions both public and private .\nAt the same time , Jews and other religious minorities are to be protected in the observance of their own traditions , in the free governance of their communal institutions , and in all matters pertaining to the rearing and education of their children .\nAdult individuals should be protected from religious or ideological coercion in their private lives and in their homes .\n5 .\nThe Rule of Law .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBy this we mean that citizens and foreigners alike , and both the government and the people , must accept and abide by the laws of the nation .\nIn America , this means accepting and living in accordance with the Constitution of 1787 , the amendments to it , duly enacted statutory law , and the great common law inheritance .\nAll agree that the repair and improvement of national legal traditions and institutions is at times necessary .\nBut necessary change must take place through the law .\nThis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our nation itself .\nRioting , looting , and other unacceptable public disorder should be swiftly put to an end .\n6 .\nFree Enterprise .\nWe believe that an economy based on private property and free enterprise is best suited to promoting the prosperity of the nation and accords with traditions of individual liberty that are central to the Anglo-American political tradition .\nWe reject the socialist principle , which supposes that the economic activity of the nation can be conducted in accordance with a rational plan dictated by the state .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute .\nEconomic policy must serve the general welfare of the nation .\nToday , globalized markets allow hostile foreign powers to despoil America and other countries of their manufacturing capacity , weakening them economically and dividing them internally .\nAt the same time , trans-national corporations showing little loyalty to any nation damage public life by censoring political speech , flooding the country with dangerous and addictive substances and pornography , and promoting obsessive , destructive personal habits .\nA prudent national economic policy should promote free enterprise , but it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aggressively pursue economic independence from hostile powers , nurture industries crucial for national defense , and restore and upgrade manufacturing capabilities critical to the public welfare .\nCrony capitalism , the selective promotion of corporate profit-making by organs of state power , should be energetically exposed and opposed .\n7 .\nPublic Research .\nAt a time when China is rapidly overtaking America and the Western nations in fields crucial for security and defense , a Cold War-type program modeled on DARPA , the \u201c moon-shot , \u201d and SDI is needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and technological research with military applications , on restoring and upgrading national manufacturing capacity , and on education in the physical sciences and engineering .\nOn the other hand , we recognize that most universities are at this point partisan and globalist in orientation and vehemently opposed to nationalist and conservative ideas .\nSuch institutions do not deserve taxpayer support unless they rededicate themselves to the national interest .\nEducation policy should serve manifest national needs .\n8 .\nFamily and Children .\nWe believe the traditional family is the source of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from public policy .\nThe traditional family , built around a lifelong bond between a man and a woman , and on a lifelong bond between parents and children , is the foundation of all other achievements of our civilization .\nThe disintegration of the family , including a marked decline in marriage and childbirth , gravely threatens the wellbeing and sustainability of democratic nations .\nAmong the causes are an unconstrained individualism that regards children as a burden , while encouraging ever more radical forms of sexual license and experimentation as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congregational life .\nEconomic and cultural conditions that foster stable family and congregational life and child-raising are priorities of the highest order .\n9 .\nImmigration .\nImmigration has made immense contributions to the strength and prosperity of Western nations .\nBut today \u2019 s penchant for uncontrolled and unassimilated immigration has become a source of weakness and instability , not strength and dynamism , threatening internal dissension and ultimately dissolution of the political community .\nWe note that Western nations have benefited from both liberal and restrictive immigration policies at various times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies until these countries summon the wit to establish more balanced , productive , and assimilationist policies .\nRestrictive policies may sometimes include a moratorium on immigration .\n10 .\nRace .\nWe believe that all men are created in the image of God and that public policy should reflect that fact .\nNo person \u2019 s worth or loyalties can be judged by the shape of his features , the color of his skin , or the results of a lab test .\nThe history of racialist ideology and oppression and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth .\nWe condemn the use of state and private institutions to discriminate and divide us against one another on the basis of race .\nThe cultural sympathies encouraged by a decent nationalism offer a sound basis for conciliation and unity among diverse communities .\nThe nationalism we espouse respects , and indeed combines , the

caravan \u2019 s members were from Venezuela , Cuba , and Nicaragua .\nThere were also Haitians , Salvadorans , Hondurans , and Guatemalans in the mix .\nIndividuals from India , Bangladesh , and some African countries were also spotted in the caravan \u2019 s ranks .\nThe caravan topped out at around 11,000 members .\nThe organizer of the caravan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Human Dignification , claimed that nearly 70 percent of the caravan \u2019 s members were women and children , from newborns to elderly individuals in their seventies .\nBut a quick Google search for images of the caravan before it dispersed seems to suggest that the composition of the caravan was not , in fact , 70 percent women and children .\nIf the scores of photos of the caravan are representative of the whole , men\u2014particularly younger , working-age men\u2014made up more than 30 percent of the caravan \u2019 s members .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ might lie about the composition of his caravan , or at least feign ignorance and embellish the truth .\nPreviously , Villagr\u00e1n organized other caravans during the Trump administration \u2019 s tenure , as well as several others last year , though those caravans also dispersed on the trek north .\nWhat is surprising , however , is Villagr\u00e1n \u2019 s candor about the fact that these caravans are nothing more than a political stunt .\n\u201c Immigration is used as a political tool .\nThese women and children are like coins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guardian .\nPrior to the caravan \u2019 s departure , the Mexican National Migration Institute ( INM ) , while not typically helpful towards such caravans , wrote a letter to Villagr\u00e1n expressing sympathy for migrants and promising to protect them .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very possible [ Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez ] Obrador wants to use this caravan to look like a humanitarian before the Summit of the Americas , \u201d the letter read , which is partly why Villagr\u00e1n scheduled the caravan \u2019 s departure to line up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t feel ashamed .\nBut he should .\nThough there might be truth in the old saying \u201c there \u2019 s safety in the herd , \u201d joining these massive caravans still involves serious risk .\nAs word spreads that these caravans are passing through certain Mexican communities , it attracts the worst of humanity .\nMigrants risk becoming victims of sexual assault or rape , or falling prey to human smugglers , coyotes , and cartels , not to mention the possibility of injury , disease , or death due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling fewer than 25 miles over the course of about a week , the INM announced that Mexican authorities granted members of the caravan documentation providing these individuals legal status in Mexico as they make their way to the U.S. Mexican law prevents migrants from traveling beyond Mexico \u2019 s southern state of Chiapas without this documentation , a provision put in place during the Trump-era migrant crisis from 2018 to 2019 .\nThough the caravan was not close to leaving Chiapas\u2014again , it only traveled about 25 miles\u2014Mexican authorities decided to grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is estimated that upwards of 9,000 individuals have received the legal status needed to continue north .\nThe INM said the documentation means \u201c migrants are prevented from being victims of criminals who are dedicated to human trafficking or traffickers who expose the migrants to unsafe conditions.\n\u201d Typically , migrants attempting to get to the U.S. do not seek or request protection from the Mexican government out of fear of being turned away by INM personnel at the border , or being deported to their home countries if they approach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico .\nBut the INM \u2019 s open communication with the caravan , as well as its quick approval of legal status for America-bound migrants , could be a concerning sign of what is to come .\nMake no mistake : The left wants to break America \u2019 s immigration system to make mass amnesty the only apparent solution to our migration problem , and gain millions of voters in the process .\nBad actors like Villagr\u00e1n do their bidding on the ground , and institutions like the INM play right into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis go away quietly will only create more crises down the line .\nIf this new precedent set by the INM becomes the norm , the result will be a vicious cycle of higher and higher levels of migration until someone with the political will comes along and says \u201c Enough.\n\u201d It may be true that providing this documentation discourages some of the current migrants from seeking extreme measures to get to the U.S.-Mexico border , where they still may attempt to buy or smuggle their way across even with their legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico is not these migrants \u2019 goal , even if Mexico would qualify as a first safe country for individuals claiming to be asylum seekers or refugees .\nNevertheless , providing this documentation only incentivizes further migration , as evidenced by the massive influx of migrants to the U.S. southern border over the course of President Joe Biden \u2019 s tenure after his promises to liberalize U.S. immigration laws .\nThe members of the latest migrant caravan are scattered in the wind for now , but soon they \u2019 ll once again amass @ @ @ @

nightmare proportions.\n\u201d Gekko then gets flirtatious with industrial policy : \u201c Now , in the days of the free market , when our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gekko goes on to assail bureaucracy , in all its forms : \u201c One thing I do know is that our paper company lost $ 110 million last year , and I \u2019 ll bet that half of that was spent in all the paperwork going back and forth between all these vice presidents.\n\u201d \u201c The new law in corporate America seems to be : survival of the unfittest , \u201d Gekko proclaims .\n\u201c Well , in my book , you either do it right , or you get eliminated.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines , the stuff frankly of modern Shakespeare ( in terms at least of contemporary political relevance ) : Now to crib from perhaps the second-most famous film about Wall Street in the Eighties , I \u2019 ll invoke American Psycho \u2018 s Patrick Bateman : \u201c Is that Donald Trump \u2019 s car ?\n\u201d Admittedly , the concept of a paleoconservative

this era of species-level existential crisis , cryptocurrency crashes , and political realignment , it is worth noting the coalitions of old are ultimately indecipherable to anyone who did not live through it ( and this writer did not , the 1980s ) .\nThe past is a foreign country .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real .\nWith the first inflation shock since before Gekko \u2019 s heyday , that everyone seems

would be naturally discouraged because it would harder to show up to the office ; large family formation was impressive and a way to get ahead in your career ; power in the hands of private companies meant minimal bureaucracy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society as Gekko put it , would be undisputedly felt , even by the haters and losers .\nThe fact that involved a country , \u201c a corporation \u201d as

there a coup attempt on January 6 ?\nFor the answer to be \u201c yes , \u201d there had to have been a realistic path by which some action on that day could have resulted in Donald Trump remaining president of the United States .\nWatching the show trial on television , you could believe it might have been possible .\nThe special committee \u2019 s TV show is dedicated to convincing a lay audience the Trump administration came \u201c that close \u201d to tossing away our democracy , with some mechanism almost clicking into place that would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easier to take the Democrats seriously if they would coolly outline just how Trump could have stayed in office without the military , who were clearly not taking a partisan stance on January 6 .\nAbsent that , you had political theater and a riot , not a coup attempt .\nThink back to the 1960s and ask yourself if occupying the administration building on campus would have stopped the Vietnam War in its tracks .\nThis is politically much ado about not much , except Democratic Party 2024 electioneering .\nTo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the White House lawn .\nInstead , America transitioned peacefully from one administration to another .\nThat hard reality is wholly missing from the Democrats \u2019 January 6 committee hearings and all the frou-frou that accompanies them .\nCould Trump have used the Capitol riot to declare martial law and stay in power ?\nNo .\nThe president can not use the military domestically in a way Congress does not agree with .\nThe \u201c web of laws \u201d Congress enacted to govern the domestic activities of the armed forces\u2014including the Posse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of federal troops to execute the law without express congressional authorization\u2014would stop Trump cold .\nAccording to well-settled principles of constitutional practice , the president can not act in a way Congress has forbidden unless the Constitution gives the president \u201c conclusive and preclusive \u201d power over the issue in dispute .\nMartial law has been declared nine times since World War II , five of which were to counter resistance to desegregation in the South .\nAlthough an uneasy climate of mutual aid has always existed between the military and civilian law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited in what they can do to enforce civil law .\nThey can \u2019 t extend a presidential term .\nThat business of tanks on the White House lawn ?\nSomeone has already thought it through .\nThe Insurrection Act of 1807 is the one statutory exception to the Posse Comitatus Act that does allow the president to deploy the military domestically , but , by precedent , the armed forces can only be used to suppress armed insurrections or to execute the laws when local or state authorities are unable or unwilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s role under this law is limited , and the existence of the Insurrection Act in no way puts the military \u201c in charge \u201d and does not suspend the normal functions and authorities of Congress , state legislatures , or the courts .\nMore importantly , troops in the streets have nothing to do with votes that are already in ballot boxes .\nSame for seizing voting machines or ballots , which were already counted by January 6 .\nAnything Trump might have tried to do on January 6 would have required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no evidence the military did .\nJust the opposite , in fact .\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , General Mark Milley , took a number of steps to ensure any dramatic orders out of the White House would be confirmed , checked , and likely delayed , perhaps indefinitely .\nWhile some of Milley \u2019 s actions raise constitutional issues of their own , particularly his interference with the nuclear chain of command , clearly Milley was in no way priming his forces to participate in any sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to point out how deeply the idea of civilian control of the military , and the separation of powers , is drummed into America \u2019 s officer corps .\nIt \u2019 s like a religion .\nUnlike many countries in the developing world , America has a professional corps well-removed from politics , which sits atop an organization built from the ground up to respond to legal , civilian orders .\nIf Trump had ordered the 82nd Airborne into the streets , their officers would have almost certainly said no .\nWith martial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coup would have had to rely on some sort of legalistic maneuver to exploit America \u2019 s complex electoral system .\nThe biggest issue there is the 20th Amendment , which states unambiguously that a president \u2019 s term ends after four years .\nIf Trump had somehow succeeded in preventing Joe Biden from being inaugurated , he still would have ceased to be president at noon on January 20 , and Nancy Pelosi , as Speaker of the House , would have become president .\nThere was no mechanism to stop that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been .\nThe most quoted Trump plan ran something like this : \u201c Somehow , \u201d even though the Electoral College had met on December 14 and decided Biden was to be president , Republican-friendly legislatures in Arizona , Michigan , Wisconsin , and Pennsylvania would \u201c ignore \u201d the popular vote in their states and appoint their own pro-Trump electors .\nThe law ( the 19th-century Electoral Count Act ) does allow legislatures to do this in the never-seen , highly unlikely event that a state fails to make a choice by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , in this case , had passed before January 6 .\nNever mind the details ; the idea , for Trump , was to introduce enough chaos into the system to force everyone in the United States to believe the only solution was to force the election , two months after voting , into Congress , where Vice President Pence himself would break the tie after every Republican agreed to play along with the scheme and choose Trump for another term .\nIn addition to every other problem with that scenario , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such thing .\nTrump maintained \u201c The Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors , \u201d when in fact , Pence \u2019 s January 6 role was entirely ceremonial , presiding as electoral votes , conveyed by the states , were counted and certified , and then announcing the outcome .\nThe location of the riots did not matter .\nAlthough the riots slightly delayed the final announcement of the results , which still occurred at the Capitol , there is nothing in the Constitution that requires the receipt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPence could have met with Congress at a truck stop outside Philadelphia and wrapped up business there .\nPence , in a 2022 speech , said \u201c I had no right to overturn the election .\nFrankly , there is almost no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president.\n\u201d To imagine a dystopian fiction where one state legislature blows past the vote to choose pro-Trump electors is difficult .\nTo imagine several doing so simultaneously to gin up enough Trump electors , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mind , is impossible .\nThere was no indication Republicans in these important states considered going along with this anyway .\nPennsylvania \u2019 s top state GOP official indicated his party would follow the law and award electors to the winner of the popular vote .\nHe stated the state legislature \u201c does not have and will not have a hand in choosing the state \u2019 s presidential electors or in deciding the outcome of the presidential election.\n\u201d Besides , the borderline states all had Democratic governors who would have refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goofy schemes were also in the wind in 2016 , when both Trump and many progressives looked to little-known electoral law for some sort of failsafe .\nThey failed , too .\nDespite the many claims about how close we came to democracy failing , in reality , our complex system proved at least twice in recent years to be made of stiffer stuff .\nWhat is missing most of all from the January 6 Democratic telethon is any acknowledgment that the system worked .\nThe Constitution held .\nOfficials from Vice President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the fear mongering , all the what-ifs Democrats now hope will distract Americans from their party \u2019 s failures of governance\u2014war , inflation , gas prices , gun violence\u2014miss the most important point of all .\nThere was no attempted coup .\nThat the committee does not plan to send a referral to the Justice Department is proof enough .\nDemocrats can \u2019 t win in 2024 on what they have to offer .\nWith all the efforts to prosecute Donald Trump for something ( including January 6 ) having failed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe Trump tried to overturn the last election , and , upon failing to do so , chose t0 re-embrace the electoral process .\nThis is little more than Trump \u2019 s third impeachment , televised .\nIf you are about preserving the rule of law , judgment for Trump \u2019 s actions must not come from a kangaroo court .\nThe real message echoing from January 6 ?\nThe system works .\nWe were never even close to losing our democracy .\nPeter Van Buren is the author of We Meant Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People , Hooper \u2019 s War : A Novel of WWII Japan , and Ghosts of

massive , unreported foreign funding flowing into America \u2019 s intellectual infrastructure shaped the country \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even cultural affairs ?\nFollowing on the heels of a 2020 Trump administration report excoriating universities\u2014including Harvard and Stanford\u2014for failing to report $ 6.5 billion in foreign funding , two new pieces of legislation have been introduced since Biden \u2019 s election that would address the influence of foreign spending in the academic , nonprofit , and think tank sectors .\nWelcome to an age of heightened concerns over foreign money flowing into America \u2019 s institutions , both private and nonprofit .\nIt has led to debates over donor transparency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and election integrity , and the proper role of charity in American civic and political life .\nConservatives tend to like the idea of donor privacy , especially in this era of cancel culture .\nBut the calculus changes a bit when you consider how foreign entities might be using U.S. nonprofits to influence public policy , notes Michael E. Hartmann , a senior fellow of the Capital Research Center and co-editor of The Giving Review .\n\u201c The legal structure of American tax-exempt nonprofitdom has always wrestled with how to manage what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and donor privacy , \u201d Hartmann says .\n\u201c Historically , there hasn \u2019 t seemed to have been as much tension between transparency and foreign funding of nonprofits\u2014that is , non-American funding of American nonprofits\u2014 [ but ] the whole set of underlying considerations with which to wrestle\u2026is just so appreciably different than the regular old domestic ones.\n\u201d Republican legislators seem to agree that the question of transparency becomes a bit more fraught when foreign interests are involved and national security concerns are raised .\nParticularly if the disclosure rules are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case with the 12 universities mentioned in the 2020 Trump administration report .\nOn the Senate side , one attempt to address the problem is to strengthen the Higher Education Act of 1965 , specifically Section 117 dealing with disclosure requirements of foreign gifts and contracts .\nRepublican Senators Tom Cotton , Bill Hagerty , Marsha Blackburn , and Tim Scott are all attached to the legislation they are calling the \u201c Foreign Funding Accountability Act , \u201d which , according to a joint release , will attempt to \u201c combat malign foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Cotton , who in 2021 released a report on \u201c decoupling \u201d from China , said the reason for the legislation is simple : If China wants to win a new economic Cold War , they will need to harness the \u201c traditionally open research \u201d on U.S. college campuses to give them a \u201c competitive advantage in all innovative fields , \u201d including semiconductors , artificial intelligence , and quantum research .\n\u201c The CCP has patiently cultivated its de facto allies on college campuses across the country , offering prestigious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lure professors and universities into sharing information , \u201d Cotton said .\n\u201c Just like every other member of the \u2018 China Lobby , \u2019 from multinational corporations and Hollywood executives to NBA stars and large banks , colleges and universities have lined their pockets with Chinese cash for years and don \u2019 t want to stop any time soon , \u201d he explained .\n\u201c The China Lobby opposes anything that might hurt their bottom line .\nAnd they know that transparency about their Chinese cash binge will bring tough questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop the inflow of Chinese money.\n\u201d Cotton said he doubts universities are in the dark about what these foreign gifts are intended to inspire .\n\u201c I find it hard to believe that they \u2019 re ignorant of what the CCP wants from them , \u201d he said .\n\u201c For example , MIT , Princeton , [ and ] Yale have all accepted millions from a Chinese tech billionaire , Ma Huateng , the founder of Tencent .\nHis company actively censors the internet in China and is at the forefront @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.I .\nIt doesn \u2019 t take a college education to suspect something is up.\n\u201d As a solution , Cotton \u2019 s legislation attempts to impose reporting requirements , which the Trump administration had established for a short period following their 2020 report .\nBut , as Cotton noted , the American Council on Education wrote a letter to President Biden begging them to halt the reporting requirement on foreign gifts .\n\u201c And of course , the Biden administration has caved to this , \u201d Cotton said .\nOver on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disclosure system for nonprofit think tanks ( often attached to academic institutions ) similar to the ones universities had before Biden caved .\nRep. Lance Gooden of Texas introduced the \u201c Think Tank and Nonprofit Foreign Influence Disclosure Act \u201d in March , which he said is an important first step in getting a handle on the \u201c undeniably rampant corruption in the non-profit sector that must be addressed.\n\u201d \u201c Americans and Congress deserve to know if the radical climate groups advocating to shut down the Keystone pipeline are funded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .\n\u201c Russia has clearly benefited from the Biden administration crippling the U.S. energy sector , and we must know if the climate groups pushing for this have been doing Russia \u2019 s bidding.\n\u201d \u201c Foreign nations will no longer be able to hide their agenda behind the non-profits they fund , \u201d Gooden continued .\n\u201c Both our adversaries and our allies will have to be transparent about the groups they support and will have to explain why they support those groups \u2019 agenda.\n\u201d Gooden \u2019 s bill would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c publicly available in a searchable database information relating to such gifts and contributions received from foreign governments and political parties.\n\u201d This would mimic the database created in June 2020 by the Department of Education to record gifts of $ 250,000 or more ( Cotton \u2019 s Senate bill would lower this threshold to $ 25,000 or more ) .\nGooden \u2019 s bill would also require disclosure of think tank or similar nonprofit funding of over $ 50,000 a year from \u201c foreign governments , foreign political parties or foreign military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreign funding alleged to be flowing into the environmental sector , which the Capital Research Center has calculated , based on a report from The Center for International Policy , is part of over $ 174 million in foreign funding to major U.S. think tanks .\nMore transparency of foreign funding in the energy and environmental sector might almost put some environmental activist groups out of business , Gooden predicts .\n\u201c If the flow of foreign funding is cut off to radical environmental groups , they will no longer have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Green New Deal priorities , \u201d Gooden said .\nThe question of what to do about foreign funding of public policy is not reserved for the right side of the political aisle .\nWhile Republicans focus on the nonprofit sector and universities , Democrats have also begun to train a powerful eye on the corporate sector , with a focus on election interference rather than public policy .\nIn 2021 , Democrats reintroduced a bill called \u201c Get Foreign Money Out of U.S.\nElections , \u201d which would \u201c block foreign-owned corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections.\n\u201d The bill would \u201c extend the federal ban on political donations from foreign nationals to multinational companies that are at least partially owned by foreign nationals , \u201d the Hill reported in December .\nWhile these legislative proposals are ongoing , conservatives have not forgotten the Foreign Agents Registration Act .\nIn early 2020 , the Department of Justice issued an advisory opinion that clarified the rules regarding when a U.S. nonprofit that receives foreign government funding must register as a foreign agent .\nThis led more than a dozen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups to warn that FARA registration was a potential threat to free speech and could threaten their mission .\n\u201c Being labeled as a foreign agent under FARA would put our neutrality and independence in jeopardy , \u201d the International Foundation for Electoral Systems said in comment .\nGiven the problem of potentially malign influence outlined above , and the obvious truth that both sides of the political aisle recognize the potential for foreign interests to be in conflict with domestic policy , FARA reform may be the easiest\u2014and quickest\u2014path to change .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which is necessary for a foreign-funded nonprofit to have to register under FARA , as I know some are strongly urging , \u201d Hartmann said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s hard to imagine that there \u2019 d be a serious objection from donor-privacy advocates to something like this , much less that any such objection would carry the day among policymakers.\n\u201d Sarah Lee is director of communications and external relations at the Capital Research Center

U.S. President Donald Trump speaks before signing the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement ( USMCA ) during a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House on January 29 , 2020 .\n( Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images ) President-elect Donald Trump arrived in D.C. with an unambiguous mandate for his agenda : Build the wall , end the wars , put America first in economics , and drain the swamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicious opposition from mainstream media , Wall Street , Big Tech , the Pentagon , the intelligence agencies , FBI , Hollywood , institutions of higher education , and GOP leadership , Trump prevailed .\nHis victory did not happen because he spent the most , but because the people agreed with his agenda and supported him .\nThis was an amazing feat .\nThere is an old adage in the salons of Washington , D.C. : \u201c Personnel is policy.\n\u201d Just like in the business world , a government institution must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority to be able to successfully implement a plan of action .\nUnfortunately , Trump failed miserably at this .\nHe repeatedly chose the wrong leaders for his administration , many of whom did not support his agenda .\nTrump \u2019 s instincts to reach out to the establishment were correct , and Reince Priebus could have served as a supportive advisor to facilitate such outreach , but it was a serious mistake to make Priebus the chief of staff .\nPriebus flooded political appointments to federal agencies with his swampy comrades and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump \u2019 s America First agenda .\nThe early personnel choices made by Priebus and his allies weakened Trump \u2019 s ability to implement promises made during his successful campaign .\nThe upper echelon of Trump \u2019 s foreign policy team represented the starkest disconnect with his campaign promises to end the wars and put the well-being of Americans first .\nFormer Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was promoted and advised by Condoleezza Rice , a principal architect of the disastrous Bush-era foreign military adventures .\nJohn Bolton , whom Trump brought on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ardent advocate for American military intervention .\nFormer Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis played key roles in the failed wars of both Iraq and Afghanistan .\nFormer Defense Secretary Mark Esper worked in George W. Bush \u2019 s Defense Department before his lobbying stint at Raytheon , a weapons contractor that notoriously lobbies for increased American interventions .\nIf Trump had hired architects with his foreign policy team \u2019 s record of failures , his buildings would have collapsed .\nUnfortunately , the list goes on to hundreds of other appointees brought into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publish a book .\nAnother fatal flaw in implementing Trump \u2019 s foreign policy agenda was his awe and respect for the generals .\nThe armchair officers sporting their wide arrays of colorful campaign ribbons capitalized on Trump \u2019 s fascination with America \u2019 s military .\nMany of them had only led our military to failures , all at the tragic expense of our citizens and the unlucky peoples of the countries we invaded .\nYet these generals do not view their disastrous records as failures , because catastrophe after catastrophe saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budgets .\nIn no other industry can leaders remain in charge if every project for which they are responsible completely fails to achieve the promised outcomes .\nDue to the chaos of his administration and constant attacks , President Trump often became isolated and leaned on his family for support .\nTrump did not fully understand , however , the risk of granting gatekeeping authority to his son-in-law , Jared Kushner , someone who had no real connection to the MAGA base .\nJared grew up a limousine liberal in a culture that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Americans in flyover country .\nJared may have impeccable manners , but his political exposure did not extend beyond New York \u2019 s Upper East Side society .\nA prime example of Jared \u2019 s disconnection from the Trump base was when he brought Brooke Rollins on to be a presidential advisor , and later moved her up to become chief domestic policy advisor .\nRollins is a Bushie open borders advocate .\nRollins now heads the America First Policy Institute , which has hired former appointees who failed to implement Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office .\nDuring his tenure as chief strategist in the Trump White House , Steve Bannon was for a time able to bypass the anti-Trump cadre to implement the America First agenda .\nHe was quickly pushed out , however , and replaced with Kushner acolytes like Rollins or swampers loyal to Vice President Mike Pence .\nOften , when President Trump directly asked that certain people be hired , they were kept out by staff , who slow-walked and gamed the system .\nMany resumes of conservatives were not even considered .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a policy of \u201c MAGA Patriots Need Not Apply.\n\u201d Even ignored was former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach , who is a well-known crusader against voter fraud and predicted the problems of the 2020 election .\nSome of the same people who assisted in the policy failures of the Trump administration still advise him .\nThey may yet again subvert a future Trump administration \u2019 s ability to be successful .\nSo what should we do ?\nGo local .\nDonald Trump courageously created a movement that has embraced his policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign interventions , making decisions based on what is good for America , and making America internally strong .\nTen years ago it was difficult to discuss any of these ideas , but now they are in the mainstream .\nThere is much to do .\nWe should seek to identify and support good candidates for school boards , county and city commissions , county Republican precinct committee members , election poll workers , sheriffs , local and state district attorneys , state representatives , and state senators .\nWhy focus on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive lower tier in our federal system will make it far more difficult for the uniparty trolls to undercut the real work of reforming our country .\nAnd even more important than building a solid foundational base , all Americans who believe in MAGA need to be ready to denounce and remove the opponents of the America First agenda in 2024 .\nPreparing to battle those enemies of freedom now will be the best defense against them when it counts .\nGeorge D.

Attorneys", "content": "San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin looks on as city supervisor Hillary Ronen speaks during a recall election-night event on June 7 , 2022 .\n( Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images ) Attorneys who work in the public sector have the unique experience and responsibility of representing not a private client , but the people , the taxpayers , society itself .\nAlong with the blessed privilege of not having to bill clients with high hourly rates\u2014a privilege I thank God for every day as a county solicitor\u2014public sector attorneys have a solemn duty not simply to provide zealous representation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to pursue what is proper under the law regardless of what that means for the outcome .\nWhen public sector attorneys in general and prosecutors in particular fail to live up to their lofty calling , the results are truly dangerous .\nA politically motivated prosecutor can use his power to unevenly apply the law and prosecute political or ideological enemies .\nAn unscrupulous prosecutor may decide his goal is to win criminal cases at any cost , covering up unfavorable evidence and trampling on the rights of defendants .\nAn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his power not to uphold and enforce the criminal law , but to enact social reform .\nThis effort is prevalent today and conservatives need to coherently identify and defeat it wherever it rears its lawless head .\nAs Justice Robert Jackson ( then United States Attorney General Jackson ) noted in his famous 1940 speech about the role of prosecutors , \u201c while the prosecutor at his best is one of the most beneficent forces in our society , when he acts from malice or other base motives , he is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is acting from base motives , from any motive other than impartially enforcing the criminal law as written to advance the common good , can not be tolerated in civil society .\nBetween the recent recall of San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin , the impending recall of Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon , and the Pennsylvania legislature \u2019 s recent decision to introduce articles of impeachment against Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner , there is potential for a movement here .\nAs Katya Sedgwick recently wrote for The American Conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District Attorney Chesa Boudin \u201c has yet to morph into a full-fledged political movement with a coherent ideology capable of delivering true change.\n\u201d But it can .\nAnd it needs to .\nThere is the potential to unite a voting coalition that could create a real law-and-order reform movement and remove the dangerous progressives currently occupying many district attorney offices .\nFirst , we should distinguish between two different types of bad prosecutors mentioned earlier .\nThe type of prosecutor who enforces the law unevenly , using the law as a weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite different from the left-wing activist prosecutor .\nThe central issue in the current moment is that we have powerful prosecutors in major cities motivated by political ideologies that , in many cases , discourage the prosecution and imprisonment of criminals .\nThe prevalent issue is not that officials use criminal prosecution as a personal weapon , but rather that for ideological reasons they are choosing not to wield the weapon at all .\nAs a result , they offer shocking plea deals to dangerous criminals .\nOr they make public announcements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crimes .\nThis is unacceptable .\nThe prosecutor \u2019 s role is to enforce the criminal laws as they are written .\nThe legislatures have passed criminal codes reflecting the will of the people as to which behaviors ought to be prosecuted as criminal .\nThe prosecutor \u2019 s job is to enforce those decisions , not to make the decisions .\nOf course , district attorneys \u2019 offices have limited resources and have to make case by case decisions about which prosecutions to focus on .\nBut announcing that certain actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prosecuted goes beyond prosecutorial discretion .\nIt is an abuse of office .\nAn analogy between the role of judges and the role of prosecutors helps explain the abuse .\nJustice Antonin Scalia was convinced that the death penalty was legally permitted under the Eighth Amendment , but he seriously wrestled with the question of whether the death penalty was moral according to his conscience and religious beliefs .\nHe concluded that it was .\nHe remarked wisely that if he was ever convinced what the law required of him was immoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resignation rather than simply ignoring duly enacted constitutional laws.\n\u201d Left-wing district attorneys ought to take note .\nIf they believe that the criminal laws passed by the legislature are immoral or ineffective , they should resign from their prosecutorial roles and run for the state legislature .\nThese activists are occupying the wrong office .\nSadly , I am not optimistic that any left-wing prosecutors will heed the call to do some soul-searching , realize they are acting lawlessly and disregarding the core duties of their office , and resign .\nTherefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impeach wayward prosecutors are necessary to stop what is becoming a crisis .\nThis movement can succeed , even in cities that consistently vote Democrat .\nIn the 1993 election for mayor of New York City , Rudy Giuliani managed to become the Republican mayor of an intensely Democratic city .\nGranted , Giuliani \u2019 s platform was rather liberal on many social issues , and he was endorsed by the Liberal Party .\nBut the point remains : New York City was devastated by violent crime , as well as \u201c a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city was uncontrollable and that the general quality of life in the city had declined.\n\u201d This feeling of unrest and a lack of control in a major Democrat-controlled city led the people to reject lawlessness and actually elect a Republican promising law and order .\nThe examples of New York City in 1993 and San Francisco in 2022 provide a valuable lesson .\nWhen violent crime invades a community , when a sense of unrest , chaos and decline envelops a society , the people act .\nThey choose law and order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities .\nConservatives need to seize these opportunities , come together with a message that will attract independent and Democrat voters , and take back control of the city streets from violent criminals and the progressives who enable them .\nThis is not mere partisan politics .\nThis is common sense .\nWithout the rule of law , no other issue matters and communities fall apart .\nThis toxic atmosphere of lawlessness and crime , of chaos and unrest , is prevalent in major cities all across the nation .\nDistrict attorneys that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major part of the problem .\nThey need to do their job or by hook or by crook , by impeachment or recall , they need to go .\nFrank DeVito is an

How long halt you between two opinions ?\n\u201d So asked Elijah of the assembled people , whether they would choose to serve the Lord or Baal .\nAnd Baal \u2019 s prophets were 450 , and Elijah was only one .\nThe challenge was simple : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophet made an altar ; and the prophets took a bull , and the prophet took a bull ; and the prophets sacrificed the bull but did not set it alight and they called on the name of their god to consume their offering .\nAnd nothing happened .\nWe received a foretaste of all this last September , when Texas \u2019 s effective ban on the murder of babies after the sixth week of pregnancy provoked the shrieking anger and despair of a votary observing the desecration of their temple .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god ; either he is talking , or he is relieving himself , or he is on a journey , or peradventure he sleeps , and must be awaked.\n\u201d So mocked Elijah.And when the prophets of Baal failed to summon a response from their master , we read they cried aloud , and cut themselves with knives so that the blood gushed out .\nAnd though they were many and persisted until the evening , from Baal there was neither voice , nor answer , nor any regard .\nSince the leak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has been an encore to the impotent tantrums of last fall .\nIn a bizarre recent display outside Justice Amy Coney Barrett \u2019 s house ,

consequences of \u201c forced births , \u201d the performance looked more like a reminder of the essential violence of tearing babies apart in their mothers \u2019 wombs .\n\u201c Come near unto me.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel , and he repaired the altar of the Lord that had broken down .\nAnd he prepared the sacrifice , and ordered that the assembly should douse it in water , that most precious thing in their dry land .\nAnd he prayed .\n\u201c Hear me , O Lord , hear me , that this people may know that you are the Lord God , and that you have turned their heart back again.\n\u201d Then the fire of the Lord fell , and consumed the burnt sacrifice , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dust , and licked up the water that was in the trench .\nAnd when all the people saw it , they fell on their faces : and they said , \u201c The Lord , he is the God ; the Lord , he is the God.\n\u201d Not every tantrum reserves its harm for the flailing child .\nWe know now that , whatever the final ruling in Dobbs , no matter how limited , a national storm is coming .\nA pro-abortion domestic terrorist group called \u201c Jane \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against crisis pregnancy centers across the

evidenced by the House \u2019 s recently passed gun-reform package , Democrats are misdiagnosing the issue yet again .\nThere is , understandably , a sentiment among Americans that those in power must do something\u2014anything\u2014to prevent tragedies like Uvalde from occurring in the future .\nThe House \u2019 s reform package is certainly an example of politicians \u201c doing

, first and foremost , because they violate Americans \u2019 Second Amendment rights .\nAn attempt to restrict our right to bear arms is an attempt to restrict our natural right to defend ourselves from government tyranny and against violence from others .\nThe principles of self-defense underpinning the Second Amendment are not and can never be outdated .\nHistory has taught us that George Mason was right when he asserted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best and most effective way to enslave them.\n\u201d Slaves were prohibited from owning firearms before the Civil War ended , and in the years following the war , states employed various unscrupulous tactics to bar black individuals from obtaining guns .\nGerman Jews were systemically disarmed in the 1930s before the Holocaust .\nAnd Armenians were stripped of their arms in the carrying out of the Armenian genocide .\nThe Second Amendment must be ardently defended , as we all have the right to defend ourselves against threats from the state and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake of conversation , let \u2019 s imagine for a moment , as many Democrats do , that the Second Amendment is out of date .\nWould the proposed reforms be a smart course of action then ?\nNo , they wouldn \u2019 t .\nBecause even if you set aside the constitutional argument for gun rights , the fact remains that gun control \u2019 s effectiveness is uncertain at best .\nDemocrats would do well to start taking alternative proposals more seriously .\nDespite the rhetoric dominating the gun-control debate , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thwart gun violence .\nFor example , take California and Illinois , which lead the United States in mass shootings despite their strict gun laws .\nAnd the Washington Post , when removing events like gang violence from mass-shooting data , found that 86 percent of mass public shootings between 2009 and 2016 occurred in gun-free zones like Robb Elementary School in Uvalde .\nThe bill that just passed the House would , among other things , ban the sale of guns with magazines that can hold more than 15 rounds .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , in 2007 , the Virginia Tech shooter had 17 magazines for his handguns , most of which held 10 rounds .\nIn 1999 , one of the Columbine shooters brought 13 magazines into the school , each of which carried 10 rounds .\nIn those tragedies , 32 and 13 people died , respectively .\nThe bill would also raise the age that one can purchase a rifle or shotgun from 18 to 21 .\nWhy this would be a priority is unclear , as the median age of school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of school shooters are under the age of 18 .\nFurthermore , the amount of attention placed on rifles like the AR-15 is curious .\nRifles were involved in just 3 percent of firearm homicides in 2020 , and according to Pew Research , handguns are by far the most common weapons used in mass shootings .\nThe measures in this bill not only violate Second Amendment rights , but are unlikely to curtail the tragedies its proponents aim to avert .\nWould a ban on all guns \u201c work \u201d better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun bans do not work .\nWhile they might disarm law-abiding citizens , placing all of our liberties at greater risk , they can \u2019 t stop determined bad actors from obtaining the goods they desire .\nAs with alcohol in the Prohibition era and marijuana to this day , restricting access to goods doesn \u2019 t eliminate the goods .\nIt merely leads to the creation of black markets .\nAustralia , often heralded as an example of a nation with ideal gun-control policies , has had to deal with an extensive @ @

Vote by Mail operative Michael Spitzer-Rubenstein effectively ran Green Bay \u2019 s election as the city \u2019 s \u201c de facto elections administrator , \u201d according to a later investigation by Wisconsin Spotlight .\nEmail chains exposed Green Bay Mayor Eric Genrich \u201c usurping \u201d the city clerk \u2019 s authority over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vote at Home crew\u2014placing the state \u2019 s third-largest election in the hands of private , partisan actors .\nIn the clerk \u2019 s words , Green Bay \u201c went rogue \u201d under Vote at Home and its Democratic allies .\nSpitzer-Rubenstein reportedly controlled four of the five keys to the room where ballots were stored and counted , had access to absentee ballots days before the 2020 election , and asked the county clerk if he and his team could \u201c cure \u201d faulty absentee ballots as they \u2019 d done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wisconsin \u201c communications toolkit \u201d in August \u201c to support

not trust the vote by mail process.\n\u201d ( It \u2019 s also worth noting that CTCL , which spent $ 10.1 million in Wisconsin , lists the National Vote at Home Institute as a partner in its schemes . )\nBut Vote at Home didn \u2019 t only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state leads on Vote at Home \u2019 s website reveals other operatives in Pennsylvania , Georgia , Texas , Michigan , Ohio , New York , and New Jersey .\nLittle is known about these operatives \u2019 meddling in the 2020 election , and most of them don \u2019 t list ( or perhaps have dropped ) National Vote at Home Institute from their LinkedIn profiles .\nBut in Ohio and Georgia , at least , Vote at Home operatives coordinated their efforts with the Leadership Now Project , formed by Obama administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Left

.\nSince the 2020 election , McReynolds has pivoted to dismissing any claims of election irregularities , fraud , or mischief as \u201c disinformation \u201d \u2014such as in one left-leaning podcast in which she \u2019 s described as a \u201c progressive \u201d : Elsewhere , she \u2019 s claimed that \u201c the 2020 election was the most secure election that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CTCL makes the same extreme claim ) and that \u201c the biggest challenge in 2020 was the disinformation and misinformation that occurred.\n\u201d Limits on mail-in voting , in her view , \u201c are aimed at restricting election officials from doing their jobs , \u201d not preventing illegal voting , while \u201c partisan actors \u201d ( read : Republicans ) are \u201c play [ ing ] games and try [ ing ] to tip the scales in the election process.\n\u201d This is pundit language and a dead giveaway for partisan leanings .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , part of the reason the disinformation spreads\u2026 is that there are not many federal standards , \u201d she told the Associated Press in May 2021 .\n\u201c We need to think about some federal standards [ for elections ] because it \u2019 s easy for bad actors to spread the wrong information because the rules vary so much by state.\n\u201d \u201c Federal standards \u201d to combat \u201c disinformation \u201d means placing control over how the elections are run in the hands of Washington bureaucrats .\nIt means ignoring the Constitution \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescribe \u201c the times , places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives \u201d ( Article 1 , Sectiom 4 ) and instead instituting the sort of top-down election system the Founders tried to prevent .\nAnyone familiar with how the left suddenly adopts a new phrase or buzzword to fit political needs won \u2019 t be surprised by the sudden popularity of a once-obscure word\u2014 \u201c disinformation \u201d \u2014previously used by intelligence services to describe false-flag operations in espionage and wartime , which is now used to describe right-wing voter-suppression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shut down debate .\nShortly after Joe Biden was sworn in as the nation \u2019 s 46th president , McReynolds got her reward : an appointment to the U.S .\nPostal Service Board of Governors , which oversees the agency .\nThere \u2019 s a catch .\nBy law , a maximum of five members of either party may serve on the nine-person board .\nAs of writing , the USPS Board of Governors has four Republicans and three Democrats , plus the \u201c independent \u201d McReynolds .\nIf the Senate confirms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s served under both Trump and Obama , Derek Kan , and a Democrat , Derek Tangherlini , who heads Laurene Powell Jobs \u2019 philanthropy Emerson Collective\u2014it would bring the total to five Republicans , four Democrats , and McReynolds .\nBy presenting McReynolds as an \u201c independent \u201d during her 2021 confirmation process , the Biden administration quietly freed up a future Democratic seat , potentially gifting the party six seats and total control over the Postal Service in the near future .\nBut is McReynolds really an independent ?\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat in 2010 , according to the conservative American Accountability Foundation .\nShe was also an advisor to the Election Validation Project , a campaign by Pierre Omidyar \u2019 s Democracy Fund to advise public officials on conducting election audits .\nThe project is headed by Jennifer Morrell , an ex-Colorado elections official who also runs the Elections Group , a CTCL ally that provides \u201c guidance \u201d to officials on implementing mail-in ballots .\nJust 10 days prior to McReynolds \u2019 appointment to the Board of Governors in February 2021 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website showed a list of partners , almost all of them left-wing political groups .\nBy March , the list had been scrubbed from Vote at Home \u2019 s website .\nNotables included the Democracy Fund , Rock the Vote , the Center for Tech and Civic Life ( CTCL ) , Center for Civic Design , the far-left Represent.US , Arabella-run Center for Secure and Modern Elections , National Association of Letter Carriers , ACLU , Common Cause , and Democratic consultancy Uprising Strategies , whose co-founder , Nick Rathod , runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas gubernatorial campaign .\nMcReynolds was confirmed to the USPS Board of Governors in May 2021 by a vote of 59 to 38 as an independent .\nRepublican William D. Zollars \u2019 term expires in December 2022 .\nWith the left pinning so many of its hopes on vote-by-mail in the future , skeptics might rightly wonder why Biden wouldn \u2019 t try to replace him with another Democrat in order to gain an illegal supermajority on the board .\nThis is hardly speculation .\nSenate Democrats started calling on Biden to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointee , earlier this year .\nWhy ?\nDeJoy is a vote-by-mail skeptic .\nDemocrats and activists have accused him of intentionally slowing down the delivery of mail\u2014and mail-in ballots\u2014ahead of the 2020 election , which DeJoy denies .\n( It is more likely that , as with everything else in 2020 , Covid-19 was responsible for slow delivery times . )\nA left-wing majority would have the power to replace DeJoy with a more pliable candidate .\nCommon Cause , a liberal litigation group and Vote at Home partner , has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c reform-minded majority \u201d on the USPS Board of Governors to \u201c fix Trump \u2019 s manufactured USPS crisis and fire DeJoy.\n\u201d Biden \u2019 s nominees uniformly count speedier delivery of mail-in ballots as central to their proposed \u201c sweeping reforms \u201d to the Postal Service .\nOne can expect the other Democrats and McReynolds to support transforming the declining agency into a ballot-delivery service , since vote-by-mail is central to the Democrats \u2019 future election strategy .\nThis risky strategy relies on propping up the Postal Service .\nUSPS lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has predicted it will run out of money by 2024 .\nTrump proposed privatizing the agency in 2018 .\nA bipartisan postal-reform bill , signed into law in April , promises to save $ 50 billion over the next decade , though critics see it as throwing good money after bad .\nIn March , Biden asked Congress for $ 10 billion to fund \u201c election infrastructure \u201d \u2014half of which would be used to boost USPS \u2019 s capacity for mail-in voting \u201c in underserved areas \u201d ( translation : rich with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ballots for an agency that has lost money for the past 15 years .\nBut the strategy makes more sense when viewed in concert with other elements designed to give Democrats a permanent edge in future elections , like CTCL \u2019 s $ 80 million campaign to get Uncle Sam to pay for the things Mark Zuckerberg funded in 2020 : more mail-in paper ballots , and taxpayer funding for drop boxes to bypass USPS should it fail to deliver the necessary votes .\nThey \u2019 re already making headway .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Vote at Home invited election officials to a two-day retreat in Phoenix , Arizona , where they were schooled in best practices related to \u201c voter-roll maintenance , \u201d \u201c envelope and application design , \u201d and other vote-by-mail elements .\nA Better Strategy for the Nation What can conservatives and their allies do ?\nHere are a few simple ideas .\nFirst , make states the battlefield for election integrity , not the federal government .\nAs of writing , 20 states have banned or restricted Zuck bucks , others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more have shored up voter ID laws .\nIn Republican-controlled states , this is low-hanging fruit .\nSecond , election administration must be transparent and free from private influence .\nThat means keeping government agencies honest and above partisanship .\nThe Left \u2019 s entire election strategy after the 2020 election hinges on co-opting government offices and subordinating them to the interests of the Democratic Party .\nShow Americans how this is deeply unfair and they \u2019 ll oppose it every time .\nThird , recognize that this opponent is a paper tiger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , entrenched left isn \u2019 t weak , but it isn \u2019 t as powerful as it pretends to be .\nExposing this novel , partisan campaign for what it is\u2014a blatant attempt to codify permanent control in Washington\u2014is a winning issue for constitutionalists .\nAfter all , CTCL \u2019 s pivot from Zuckerberg funding in 2020 to federal funding in 2021\u201322 is as good as admitting that they don \u2019 t believe private funding for elections is sustainable or popular with the American people .\nClever conservatives will demand their opponents answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private , special interests ought to fund public elections agencies ?\nThis is a fight we can win .\nHayden Ludwig is a senior investigative researcher at the Capital Research Center", "author": "Hayden Ludwig", "url": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-push-for-permanent-vote-by-mail/", "published": "Thu, 23 Jun 2022 04:01:40 +0000", "published_utc": 1655971300, "collection_utc": 1655982855}, {"id": "theamericanconservative--2022-06-23--Restoring the Founders\u2019 Vision of Religion", "date": "2022-06-23", "source": "theamericanconservative", "title": "Restoring the Founders\u2019 Vision of Religion", "content": "While the nation waits for the Supreme Court to release its opinion in Dobbs v.

disdain for opponents leading to credulousness ( notably , citing an obvious internet forgery as an example of an actual antifa text ) .\nOther flaws come hand-in-hand with the book \u2019 s strengths .\nPaul Valone is a guy who has achieved successes with an uncompromising grassroots group focused on making a difference via the legislative process .\nPerhaps unsurprisingly , he feels the solution to [ your columnist waves his hands at everything ] is establishing lots and lots of no-compromise grassroots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislative process .\nThe result is that the book is strongest on that front and weaker on activism outside that process .\nValone divides activist action into economic , political , legal , and non-legislative .\nHe is comfortably at home in the political and legal : passing or scuttling laws , getting politicians elected or defeated , and issuing stern legal letters or filing lawsuits .\nThese are the best and most thorough sections of the book .\nHe is less comfortable and less detailed on corporate campaigns , boycotts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than the stuff Righties usually get .\nValone \u2019 s analysis of what makes a target susceptible to a boycott ( \u201c Will your supporters boycott the target ?\nDoes the target make money from your supporters ?\nIs the target vulnerable to negative media ?\nWill other groups pile on ?\nIs the company otherwise vulnerable ?\n\u201d ) is less sophisticated than the methods used by leftist groups to consider such things , but it \u2019 s likely to be eye-opening to people who haven \u2019 t considered what , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually goes into making boycotts possible .\nOn non-legislative action , Valone is weaker , in part because\u2014like a lot of people on the right\u2014he finds the tactics and strategies leftists use to be viscerally repulsive or pointless .\n( The nastiest tactic Valone recommends is doxxing , which he used successfully against journalists who published a database of CCW holders . )\nA memorable flowchart traces the decision-making process : Is a situation suited for economic pressure ?\nor legal pressure ?\nor political pressure ?\nAnd if all answers are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure of a man with a giant screw protruding from his chest .\nLeftists are much better at this , both in terms of identifying opportunities for pressure and in finding alternatives if one target proves too challenging .\nValone is on stronger footing when he provides words of caution in other areas .\nHe is quite down on some things pugnacious grassroots conservatives tend to very much like the idea of , such as bold civil disobedience ( which he notes invites risk , particularly in hostile political environments : \u201c wouldn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felon ?\n\u201d ) .\nHe is also , interestingly , skeptical of rallies .\nWhen Virginia gun-rights activists held a large rally in 2019 , allies across the nation found it tremendously heartening .\nNot Valone .\nAsked to hold a similar rally in North Carolina , he replied : While Valone is not averse to lawsuits , he also offers cautions on the subject of legal action .\nThe last few generations of Americans , raised on heroic civil-rights-movement tales , tend to think about litigation being used to change policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is expensive , and the outcome is uncertain .\nAlso , it \u2019 s a lot of work for you to make sure your attorneys and any co-litigants are on the same page as you .\nWith Valone \u2019 s painful experiences in litigation have also come gains , so he shares valuable insight on hiring attorneys , recruiting plaintiffs , overseeing the process , and using the media .\nValone hammers home repeatedly something he does have in common with leftist organizers : the cold fact that you don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by building power .\nAnd on the legislative front , the way you build power is to provide or deny the things politicians crave : votes , money , influence , and public accolades .\nMere personal pugnacity does not suffice ; you must show politicians that you are serious , that you represent a sizable constituency , that you can hurt them come election time , and that you are utterly persistent .\nAs Valone puts it , \u201c you will identify three simple things : 1 .\nThe problem ; 2.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem ; and 3 .\nWhat will motivate the person ( or persons ) to solve it.\n\u201d To do so , you must \u201c embrace conflict , \u201d \u201c avoid compromise , \u201d and \u201c never compromise principle.\n\u201d Compromise , in Valone \u2019 s view , not only undercuts your position , but provides an opening for corruption , which is not necessarily pure graft so much as serving one \u2019 s own self-interest over that of the people whom activists and ostensibly allied politicians are supposed to be serving .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefers gaining power indirectly over running for office as an activist candidate , on the grounds that \u201c it \u2019 s generally a whole lot more fun beating up politicians than getting beaten up.\n\u201d Educating politicians doesn \u2019 t work\u2014and if they \u2019 re opposed to you , efforts to change their mind by educating them will just teach them how to hurt you better .\nYou need to pressure them , not teach them ; if they do what you want , it doesn \u2019 t matter what they think .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not access , and Valone is frank about the challenges involved , especially when you \u2019 re a grassroots organizer doing it with all-too-human volunteers .\nIn terms of organizational structure , Valone recommends a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) and a PAC .\nHe provides helpful information on their requirements and uses , including how to prioritize the work .\nUnquestionably , the best parts of the book deal with herding legislators and getting them to pass or defeat the laws you \u2019 d like .\nThis requires knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Valone provides a concise but detailed overview , including the importance of spotting local idiosyncrasies and having multiple people to read hostile bills and check referenced statutes in order to make sure nothing slips by you\u2014and then using the issues you find one at a time , to make sure legislation you oppose faces a new obstacle every step of its way to passage , a technique Valone calls \u201c layered defense.\n\u201d On the flip side , he offers practical advice on drafting bills and finding sponsors ( you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideologically solid , not a loose cannon with respect to his or her party , electorally secure with good credibility , and on the committee that will hear your bill ) and caring for the sponsor , to maintain and build that relationship , as well as how to make sure the bill actually makes it through\u2014and how to deal with the various ways politicians and other players react to the pressure you put on .\nRules for Anti-Radicals is not the be-all and end-all of right-of-center grassroots organizing books that Valone wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detailed and useful guide to parts of organizing that the right side of the aisle needs to be using a lot more .\nIt \u2019 s also a fun look at one man \u2019 s experience organizing on the right .\nAnd we need more of those !\nIf you know of any good conservative activist memoirs , the more war stories the better , drop me a line at organizeright @ protonmail.com .\nI \u2019 d love to review some .\nAnd if you happen to be an effective conservative activist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of insights and war stories that should be passed on , I \u2019 ll tell you what Robert Caro , through an intermediary , told the aged brother of Lyndon Johnson \u2019 s long-dead moneyman Herman Brown in order to secure an interview : \u201c No matter how many buildings he puts Herman Brown \u2019 s name on , in a few years no one is going to know who Herman Brown was if he \u2019 s not in a book.\n\u201d So if that \u2019 s you , go write @ @", "author": "David Hines", "url": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/rules-for-right-wing-radicals/", "published": "Fri, 24 Jun 2022 04:01:20 +0000", "published_utc": 1656057680, "collection_utc": 1656069444}, {"id": "theamericanconservative--2022-06-25--Roe Falls: The End of the Beginning", "date": "2022-06-25", "source": "theamericanconservative", "title": "Roe Falls: The End of the Beginning", "content": "Demonstrators in front of the U.S. Supreme Court moments before the Dobbs v Jackson Women 's Health Organization ruling on June 24 , 2022 .\n( Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images ) Though it seems anecdotally that the inverse is more common , I found my way into the world of politics by virtue of being pro-life .\nIt was in middle school that I first learned that the people of an alien culture coexisting beside my own still sacrificed children to demons , and did so in temples that aped healthcare clinics with priests masquerading as medical doctors .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of action , and I spent much of my time in the years that followed praying at clinics and marching in protests and advocating for the unborn in what little ways I could .\nMy entire worldview formed around this one , simple belief : Murdering babies is bad , and it ought to be illegal .\nYet even in pro-life circles , and even in the last decade , that outcome seemed far from guaranteed .\nEveryone wanted to see Roe overturned , and most held out hope that someday it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed as something off on the horizon\u2014as the end goal of a struggle that may , if we were fortunate , see resolution in our lifetime .\nIt happened yesterday .\nAfter nearly half a century of wholesale industrial slaughter , a Supreme Court majority\u2014comprising Samuel Alito , the three justices appointed by Donald Trump , John Roberts along for the ride , and Clarence Thomas concurring with a flamethrower\u2014has overturned Roe v.

the people and their elected representatives.\n\u201d But this is not victory .\nIn Dobbs , the Court did not strike down the sacrifice of children ; it just struck down the mandatory sacrifice of

prevent the people \u2019 s elected representatives from deciding how abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is given of what that looked like before Roe : Until the latter part of the 20th century , there was no support in American law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion .\nNo state constitutional provision had recognized such a right .\nUntil a few years before Roe , no federal or state court had recognized such a right .\nNor had any scholarly treatise .\nIndeed , abortion had long been a crime in every single State .\nAt common law , abortion was criminal in at least some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlawful and could have very serious consequences at all stages .\nAmerican law followed the common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s expanded criminal liability for abortions .\nBy the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted , three-quarters of the States had made abortion a crime at any stage of pregnancy .\nThis summary has the double effect of reminding how little foundation Roe had in American history and law , and suggesting how much damage\u2014beyond , of course , the 63 million human victims\u2014the Burger Court \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal and moral landscape of pre-Roe America on the question of a child \u2019 s right to life has been demolished .\nAfter 50 years of brutal damage to the conscience and Constitution of a nation effectively possessed , there can be no quick or easy return to the historic American consensus that murdering babies is bad , and ought to be illegal .\nRoe is dead .\nThat means the first phase of a cultural and spiritual war has been settled in our favor .\nBut the war will go on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spill over into more than the cultural and spiritual domains .\nThe most devoted partisans of legal

protection .\nYet that is exactly the situation Dobbs now sends us hurtling towards .\nMany states will now affirm the most basic right bestowed on all human beings by their creator .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ will try to broker an impossible compromise between the camps of life and death .\nMost important of all will be those states that commit themselves fully to Moloch \u2019 s cause .\nNotably leading

.\nIt is not morning in America anymore .\nIt \u2019 s late on Sunday afternoon , and it \u2019 s raining .\nStart with his record-breaking vacation time .\nIt became a meme during the Trump years to criticize him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point out how much the Secret Service paid him for their accommodations .\nYet as he marks Day 500 , Biden is preparing for another weekend scram , and is on track to take more vacation than any of his predecessors .\nSince taking office , Biden has spent 191 days away from the White House vacationing in either of his two Delaware properties , at Camp David , or on Nantucket .\nTrump spent 381 days away from the White House over four years .\nAnd as for those Secret Service room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every president .\nMembers of the Service are prohibited from accepting \u201c gifts , \u201d even the free accommodations necessary to protect the president .\nAt Biden \u2019 s home in Delaware he charged the Secret Service $ 2,200 a month in rent for a cottage on his property when he was vice president .\nHe made $ 66,000 in total off of the Service in 2013 , and while contemporary figures are not available , they are certainly tallying up as they did under Trump and the others .\nHillary bought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Secret Service , anticipating her victory in 2016 .\nBut what of the time Joe Biden has spent actually in the White House ?\nHow have the 500 days gone so far ?\nBiden succeeded primarily in engineering a new form of war in Ukraine\u2014not quite cold and not quite hot .\nAmerican special forces may soon be on the ground in Kiev and American ships in the Black Sea .\nThe Ukrainians have boasted how American intelligence and targeting information have been used to kill Russian ships , tanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the global black-arms market might mean , Biden is sending billions of top-notch weapons into the nation with the avowed aim of bleeding out Russia .\nWhen something like this was tried in Afghanistan in the 1980s , the U.S. had the common courtesy to do it through the CIA and keep at least some of it secret .\nNo more .\nVladimir Putin in return has reminded the world several times that he has nuclear weapons he is not all that opposed to using .\nJoe Biden has succeeded where presidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans to bed at night worrying about nuclear holocaust .\nThat is his greatest foreign-policy accomplishment absent the disastrous evacuation from Afghanistan and a soon-to-really-happen trip to forgive the Saudis for their sins and become the first president since the 1970s to overtly beg for more oil .\nFor the record , Trump was the only president in some 20 years who did not start a new war during his term and the only one in that same period who made an effort to seek peace with North Korea , a country Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhen asked in Seoul if he had a message for Kim Jong Un , Biden said , \u201c Hello .\nPeriod.\n\u201d In other Leader of the Free World accomplishments , Biden has been snubbed by Mexico , which refused to attend the Summit of the Americas because Biden would not also invite Cuba , Nicaragua , and Venezuela , all Cold War hissy-fits

Russian energy\u2014but just not for a couple more months , okay ?\nThey have stopped buying energy delivered by ship as a face-saving gesture , just as they keep lapping up the massive pipeline-delivered materials .\nBut Biden did travel twice to Europe and declared \u201c America is back , \u201d so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic achievements , everyone in America knows about Joe \u2019 s gas pains .\nBiden apparently sees no connection between his restrictions on domestic production and sanctions against Russian energy , cutting supply at a time when demand is rising , and inflationary prices .\nThe good news is , we imposed sanctions on Russia\u2014well , no , it \u2019 s not good news ; Russia is still fighting away in Ukraine , which means the sanctions have failed in their primary function .\nBiden will give them more time , apparently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to otherwise curtail or end the fight .\nOf course , Joe did finally pass a $ 1.2 trillion infrastructure spending bill , which in no way could have contributed to inflation by dumping money into an economy still chasing goods scarce from supply-chain issues .\nHe also signed that $ 1.9 trillion Covid-relief bill which also could not have contributed to inflation by dumping money into an economy still chasing goods scarce from supply-chain issues .\nAt least wages are up , which pours more money into an already inflationary economy .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biggest Achievements for us in case they were hard to pick , including appointing a boatload of judges , 80 percent of whom are women and 53 percent are people of color ( \u201c judges that reflect our nation \u201d ) .\nBiden has also strategically secured America by overturning the Trump ban on transgender people serving in the military .\nIn fact , the White House brags it has the first majority non-white Cabinet in history , with the most women of any Cabinet , including the first woman Treasury Secretary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials , and the first woman Director of National Intelligence .\nBut it is always best to go to the source , and the White House has kept its own list of \u201c record firsts \u201d in Joe \u2019 s presidency .\nYou can read them yourself , but you \u2019 ll run into the same problem everyone else does : it is all boasting with no links , sources , or details attached .\nSo we hear , for

especially given how much \u201c not our fault \u201d garbage this administration tosses around when someone brings up a topic like inflation .\nAs for issues important to Democrats like gun control , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates a zero .\nThe EPA continues to recommend Flint , Michigan , residents use filters in their homes to remove lead from public water .\nJoe has driven home the idea that unless a

Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema , stymieing much of his legislative agenda .\nOn the other side of the aisle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an \u201c epiphany \u201d after Trump left office , but that has not yet

they \u2019 re pretty good .\nIf interested , you can read the palatial \u201c Can Ron DeSantis Displace Donald Trump as the G.O.P.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Filkins , and Ronny & Nancy of Tallahassee from Tina Nguyen in Puck , which expands on prior coverage of the impossibly powerful presence of DeSantis \u2019 s wife , Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis .\nThat relationship is compared there , of course , to Ronald and Nancy Reagan .\nThe assertion is that their Floridian pairing has taken on the appearance of a true Sunshine State duumvirate .\nDeSantis \u2019 old Yale , Harvard and military chums seem less important .\nClose perhaps only with his wife , the 40th president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately , in enigma , and that comparison is now being made to the current Florida governor .\nSuch relationships in politics can be a double-edged sword : enviable stuff in good times ( who wouldn \u2019 t want to be in love ? )\n, but the source of all evil in bad times .\nIf DeSantis was less successful , this duo would be compared negatively to the likes of the unknowable leftist president Daniel Ortaga and his spouse Rosario Murillo of Nicaragua , and not to a legendary Republican predecessor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual about DeSantis , now a major contender in the presidential arena , is that he is a certified introvert .\nNow to assert some \u201c street cred \u201d and a disclosure : Your writer voted for Trump in the 2016 primaries , and presidential elections , and if needed , one can poll my friends , girlfriends , and family as I shocked and awed them with enthusiasm from July 2015 on .\nIn fact , I took him seriously from about May that year on , when front-runner Jeb Bush was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama , or whatever .\nTrump presented what I felt was a more accurate snapshot of the state of the union : \u201c This country is a hellhole.\n\u201d I remain today much the kind of voter I was then : If history had played differently , I would have gladly voted for Bernie Sanders over Jeb Bush , or whatever version of Marco Rubio we were on back then .\nBut that time changed it all : My generation would be defined by a miserable street fight between right and left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today the left is the American establishment , par excellence .\nAnd yet , doubts about Trump \u2019 s ability to change this country for the better surfaced from the beginning : the endless personnel carousel , the insidious refusal to play the ultimate presidential Trump card , appearing above-the-fray .\nThen-White House chief strategist Steve Bannon told the Weekly Standard upon his August 2017 ouster : \u201c The Trump presidency that we fought for , and won , is over .\n\u2026 It \u2019 ll be something else .\n\u2026 And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there \u2019 ll be good days and bad days , but that presidency is over.\n\u201d And true enough , it was something else , and the world since March 2020 has made 2017-2019 seem like a pleasant hallucination , surely the main fount of Trump \u2019 s enduring appeal .\nTimes were pretty great , even if we didn \u2019 t know it .\nBut back to the future .\nTimes columnist Ross Douthat sees a 2016 redux .\nCiting a very positive single poll for DeSantis in New Hampshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this as evidence DeSantis is consolidating the ideological , high-information conservative voter \u2014 the \u2018 movement \u2019 bloc that Cruz won in 2016 .\nTrump still has more of the disaffected , less-political , populist bloc.\n\u201d I could not disagree more , and would gently remind the very talented Mr. Douthat that he picked Marco Rubio as the winner of the 2016 primary .\nDeSantis \u2019 s appeal is far less \u201c Bible-thumping \u201d ( putting aside how religious Cruz really is , and putting aside the crude hatred of the faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Cruz \u2019 s image .\nDeSantis \u2019 s culture-warring is far more suited for new American fault lines , if you buy the now-infamous \u201c Hochman Thesis.\n\u201d Now , to \u201c steelman \u201d the DeSantis case .\nFlorida in the age of the coronavirus has become a true countermodel , known not only in the rest of the United States , but positively notorious as well in Europe , as a place to collectively escape Western hysteria and do some business .\nEvery day brings news of a fresh relocation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad boy hedge fund , appropriately named for these purposes Citadel , which is packing up from Chicago and getting on I-24 full-speed to Miami .\nEven Trump now lives most of the year closer to the Gulf of Mexico than Manhattan .\nCovid-19 , its still-unexplained origins , and the schizophrenic reaction to it from the American establishment have supplanted 9/11 , the 2008 financial crisis , and the 2016 election as the touchstone of most Americans \u2019 political lives .\nEspecially conservatives .\nEspecially younger votes .\nI turned thirty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my childhood .\nAnd so , politically maxed out , DeSantis is not Ted Cruz circa 2016 ( please ) but rather a combination of Trump in 2016 ( a proven fighter ) and Glenn Youngkin in 2021 .\nHe won \u2019 t revolt suburbanites , at least not in the same way .\nAesthetically , DeSantis \u2019 s classic smarts and non-boomerism , played correctly , could engender him broader respect , or at least a less catatonic response from people who do not vote for him .\nOne imagines him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that won \u2019 t up the ante still further on America \u2019 s increasingly egregious gender divide .\nThe rap on DeSantis from the hardcore , though , is that you can \u2019 t trust him .\nIndeed , as Douthat \u2019 s audience on Twitter correctly responded to a poll he put out , opposition to DeSantis may intellectually come most passionately from \u201c early Trump adopters.\n\u201d In the most extreme critique , they see a Bushie in a nationalist \u2019 s clothing .\nThe most incendiary condemnation surfaced in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is standoffish , impersonal , cold , imperious .\nThat has not been my limited experience .\nIn my one interaction , he was social , drank Cabernet Sauvignon , answered all questions politely , even when he began to doubt the response out of Washington on the pandemic , a lockdown response one reminds that was originally led by President Donald Trump ( \u2018 \u201d late March [ 2020 ] , \u2019 DeSantis answered quickly , on when his doubts surfaced \u201d ) .\nSure enough , news of that fissure broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only wished he doubted Trump sooner .\nIt is probably true enough that DeSantis would not have moved the \u201c Overton window \u201d on what is possible in American politics as Trump did in 2016 , putting an end to the stale Obama-era paradigm , drearily Fukuyaman in its own way .\nBut if my coverage and sporadic access to political VIP \u2019 s has taught me anything , it is respect for an open will to power .\nPoliticians are not philosophers , and if they are , they can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have not been the man for 2017-2019 , but in the Covid-19 complex ( and attendant cultural revolution ) , the Florida governor found his crisis .\nHe did not shrink from it .\nDespite his elite background , he distrusted the elite when it mattered most .\nThe knock on getting through Harvard and Yale is not that that you are naturally stupid or evil ( of course not , if anything the opposite ) , it \u2019 s that to get through those institutions today you have to become stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that DeSantis comes out of those places then is a testament to his work ethic and discipline , not his ideology .\nBy all evidence , a DeSantis administration would not be trojan-horsed old medicine .\nNot the \u201c realism \u201d and \u201c restraint \u201d of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo .\nNot the \u201c nationalism \u201d of Ted Cruz ( that speech happened ) .\nIf one had to close out this case , age would be the determining factor .\nNow 76 , Trump remains hilariously energetic for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference between the two men \u2019 s ages is greater than this writer \u2019 s lifespan .\nFinally having a president young enough for the job would feel like a jump off the high-dive .\nIn the end , competence matters , too .\nIf it really is the \u201c Flight 93 \u201d era , then it would seem incumbent to remorselessly pick the most-skilled pilot .", "author": "Curt Mills", "url": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/in-defense-of-ron-desantis-professional-politician/", "published": "Mon,

Blessed Virgin Mary .\nPro-abortion protestors vandalized a church in Virginia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire in a nearby mulch bed .\nSt. Colman Catholic Church in Shady Spring , West Virginia , was burned

persecution , such as it is , pales in comparison to that of Christians in the Islamic world or Christians in the Church \u2019 s early centuries .\nI do think , however , that the reaction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both its supporters and opponents that Christianity lies at the heart of the abortion debate points to the intractable divide between Christianity and the world , which endures in spite of progressive Christians \u2019 efforts to capitulate to the spirit of the age .\nThere is an old idea within the Catholic intellectual tradition called contemptus mundi\u2014contempt of the world .\nIt denotes the believer \u2019 s obligation to spurn the temporal world for higher things .\nScripture makes clear that the \u201c contempt \u201d comes from the other direction , too .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @

world , \u201d but not \u201c of the world \u201d presupposes an antagonism between the temporal world and authentic Christian faith .\nSome Christians reject the notion that this antagonism persists in liberal modernity is rejected by some Christians .\nThey think the modern world is basically good and praiseworthy .\nThey insist that if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is the Church that must change .\nThis view dominates segments of organized Christianity .\nYou can hardly drive by a mainline Protestant church in the United States without seeing a gay pride flag .\nEven the Catholic Church , famously antipathetic to the world and its princes , softened its posture considerably after the Second Vatican Council .\nAs the Vatican newspaper L \u2019 Osservatore Romano wrote in 1974 , the modern Church has been eager to find \u201c points of convergence between the Church \u2019 s thinking and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and administer , in the words of Pope John XXIII , \u201c the medicine of mercy rather than severity.\n\u201d But the Catholic Church , however mealy-mouthed its prelates , has never wavered at the institutional level on the issue of abortion .\nAnd since abortion is the central sacrament of liberal modernity\u2014representing as it does the complete freedom of the individual against unchosen obligations\u2014the Church finds herself the natural and inevitable object of the world \u2019 s hatred .\nThis antipathy between the Church and the world has endured across generations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amerio observed , the Church insists upon those virtues most deficient in each era : One can therefore conclude to a general rule that while Catholicism \u2019 s antagonism to the world is unchanging , the forms of the antagonism change when the state of the world requires a change in that opposition to be declared and maintained on particular points of belief or in particular historical circumstances .\nThus the Church exalts poverty when the world ( and the Church herself ) worships riches , mortification of the flesh when the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reason when the world turns to illogicality and sentimentalism , faith when the world is swollen with the pride of knowledge .\nAmerio points to the thirteenth century , when the Church confronted \u201c violence and greed \u201d with the \u201c spirit of meekness and poverty in the great Fransiscan movement , \u201d and the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , when the Church responded to the modernism crisis by \u201c condemning the principle of the independence of reason.\n\u201d It is why the Church today is accused of being \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insists that the Church \u2019 s teaching is wrong , and the Church insists , with equal vigor , that she is right .\nSo as churches are defaced in response to the Court \u2019 s ruling in Dobbs , the proper response is not , as some progressive Christians have done , to insist that the overturn of Roe is a \u201c bastardization \u201d of Christianity , that Jesus Christ would have been fine with abortion , and that the Church must change to meet the demands of the times .\nNeither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whimper on social media about the \u201c persecution \u201d of Christians .\nThe proper response is the one Kempis identified in the apostles : \u201c they had their conversation in this world blameless , so humble and meek , without any malice or deceit , that they even rejoiced to suffer rebukes for Thy Name \u2019 s sake , and what things the world hateth , they embraced with great joy.\n\u201d Instead of complaining on television

Jackson Women \u2019 s Health corrects a moral and constitutional travesty .\nThe Court concluded in its opinion : \u201c Abortion presents a profound moral question .\nThe Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion .\nRoe and Casey arrogated that authority .\nWe now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives.\n\u201d For decades , even prominent legal scholars on the left have admitted that Roe is bad law .\nThe falsehood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution has finally come to an end with Dobbs .\nBut this is not the end of the conversation about the legal reasoning in Dobbs .\nAs Justice Thomas says in his concurring opinion , the Court has correctly applied the rules of its substantive due process jurisprudence to find there is no substantive due process right to abortion .\nHe explains that the Court has long analyzed whether a substantive-due-process right exists under the Fourteenth Amendment by determining whether the right is \u201c deeply rooted in this Nation \u2019 s history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concept of ordered liberty.\n\u201d The Dobbs Court , he says , is correct that there was no history or tradition in America at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified that justifies a right to abortion .\nBut , Justice Thomas goes on , the Court should not be using that substantive-due-process analysis at all .\nFor decades , the Court has been using the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to declare fundamental rights that are not explicitly written in the Constitution .\nThe relevant clause requires that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , liberty , or property , without due process of law.\n\u201d Looking at the history of due-process rights , Justice Thomas points out that due process means simply that a certain process is due to citizens before their rights to life , liberty , or property can be taken away .\nFor example , if the government intends to deprive a criminal of life or liberty , or intends to confiscate a person \u2019 s property under a certain law , the person is constitutionally entitled to due process .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s intention , and a fair hearing on the merits of the government \u2019 s claim .\nThe Courts have turned \u201c due process \u201d into something far beyond the process that a person is due .\nWhy does this matter ?\nFirst of all , proponents of originalist legal theory want to interpret the text correctly , period .\nThe goal is not simply to get \u201c the right outcome , \u201d but to make sure judges are doing their work properly and interpreting the law before them according to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created through many decades of precedent , the majority opinion in Dobbs is accepting an incorrect reading of the Fourteenth Amendment .\nAs a matter of principle , judges should not do that .\nOne can argue that precedent has its place and that it is not expedient to unwind a long-established and well-used precedent .\nBut if one is committed to the idea that judges must be restrained to interpret the law as written without weighing the potential practical effects of their judgments , then Justice Thomas is correct and the concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from American law .\nBesides the fact that it lacks a basis in the Constitution , Justice Thomas points to three reasons substantive due process is \u201c particularly dangerous.\n\u201d First , the doctrine exalts judges above the democratically elected branches of government by allowing judges to use the Due Process Clause to divine new rights rather than for the limited task of ensuring the people are given due process ( notice and a fair hearing ) .\nAbortion is only one of many \u201c rights \u201d the Supreme Court has found hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the creation of new fundamental rights complicates and distorts other areas of constitutional law .\nFor example , once a new fundamental right is found for one class of persons , the Court must determine under the Equal Protection Clause if other classes of persons are entitled to the right .\nThird , the creation of rights not found explicitly in the Constitution is dangerous ground with a tradition of frightful results .\nJustice Thomas explains that in the Dred Scott case , \u201c the Court invoked a species of substantive due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to emancipate slaves brought into the federal territories.\n\u201d This is not to say that there is no such thing as an unenumerated right .\nSurely the people have rights that are not explicitly written in the Constitution .\nThe Ninth Amendment says this explicitly : \u201c The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\n\u201d The point is not that there are no unenumerated rights , but that those rights clearly do not come from the Due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dobbs ruling , conservatives ought to study and take seriously Justice Thomas \u2019 s concurring opinion .\nThomas \u2019 s clear prose points out both the theoretical and practical problems of continuing to accept grave errors in constitutional interpretation .\nPrecedent and an unwillingness to upset the tangled web the Court has woven should not overrule the duty of judges to interpret the law faithfully .\nAs we look with hope on a Court finally willing to make bold , honest rulings regardless of the political consequences ( see Dobbs , Carson v. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bremerton School District ) , perhaps conservative originalists can even dare to hope that the Court will be bold enough to unwind doctrines such as substantive due process that have caused such abuses of judicial power .\nFrank DeVito is an attorney and a current fellow

they saw as the rising power of the political reactionaries in their cheap suits , their religious obscurantism , and their unwashed supporters from the hinterlands .\nMass demonstrations were organized , castigating the traditional religious values important to the challenger \u2019 s voters as inherently theocratic and unacceptable .\nThey underscored the message that when it came to political thought , no diversity was to be permitted .\nConformity to elite delineation of what constituted acceptable discourse was rigidly enforced .\nMedia organs that on rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were silenced\u2014sometimes their stay in the penalty box was short-lived , on other occasions it was permanent .\nThe political leader was subjected to investigation and prosecution , hounded from office , and banned from the public square .\nAnti-establishment activists and critics , political moderates who simply questioned the wisdom of the established order , pious citizens , and others were threatened with exposure as closet reactionaries , shunned , and purged from public life .\nThey were condemned by judges and bureaucrats relying on establishment media \u201c reporting \u201d as evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their efforts to indoctrinate school children in the dominant ideology and undercut religious instruction and values .\nMany students , particularly women , who did not affirmatively support the ideological line were denied access to universities .\nThe enforcement of the dominant ideology and the establishment regime , one top general proclaimed , would continue for 1,000 years under the watchful eye of the security apparatus .\nThis coup is often referred to in Turkey as \u201c the February 28 Process , \u201d an acknowledgment of its campaign-like nature and continuation in force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in June of that year .\nIt stands as a testament to precisely the kind of surreptitious political engineering that has long been common in parts of the world thought by many in the West to be insufficiently evolved and enlightened .\nIn this case , the coup orchestrators saw themselves as the vanguard of progress against the backwardness of religiosity and traditional social structures .\nThat there are similarities between these events in Turkey and the current American political climate , including a strong polarization between a progressive elite cadre and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model applies in the era of the administrative state even across distinct cultural environments .\nDespite the judicial banning of Refah and the Turkish military \u2019 s insistence that the February 28 Process would endure , the political movement once nurtured by Erbakan came roaring back .\nThe charismatic Recep Tayyip Erdogan , who as a young Erbakan associate and popular mayor of Istanbul was stripped of his office and jailed as part of the accompanying crackdown , returned to politics as the leader of the Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AKP won its first election in 2002 .\nErdogan \u2019 s AKP benefitted from the fervent commitment of its core supporters , the growing public sense of the secularist elite \u2019 s disconnectedness from the aspirations and interests of the electorate , and the generally catastrophic political performance of the secularist governments that followed Refah .\nAll in all , the AKP \u2019 s emergence was a resounding rebuke to the February 28 Process and its pretensions .\nOr so some might have thought .\nRather than accept the AKP as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kemalist establishment , blinded by ideology and power interests , resumed what it perceived as its existential struggle against the forces of reaction\u2014acting , in the words of an old Kemalist saying , \u201c for the people , in spite of the people.\n\u201d Erdogan and his party faced daily pressure from the generals , including open threats of intervention , military-orchestrated efforts by the Kemalist judiciary to destabilize the government through novel interpretations of Turkish election laws , and even a Constitutional Court case in 2008 to outlaw the AKP that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elite concerns of a popular backlash .\nThe last chance for compromise on the rules of the game in Turkey ended on July 15 , 2016 , with an attempted military coup that left about 250 people dead and another 2,194 injured .\nFor Erdogan , who in 2014 became Turkey \u2019 s first popularly elected president , the February 28 Process had been a politically formative experience .\nHe and his associates had learned well the Kemalist regime \u2019 s harsh lessons .\nTheir response to the failed 2016 coup\u2014which ran aground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take to the streets in protest\u2014was a broad purge of the state bureaucracy along the lines established by earlier military purges against their enemies .\nThe targets included the followers of Fethullah Gulen , an erstwhile AKP ally , who under pressure from the Kemalists left Turkey for the U.S. shortly after the February 28 Process began .\nGulen \u2019 s own movement , once influential in Turkish bureaucratic life , is widely believed in Turkey to have been behind the coup attempt .\nThe other targets were the Kemalists themselves , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not Turkey .\nNevertheless , the ease with which the Deep State narrative has planted itself in the American political consciousness owes a great deal to the increasingly evident factors America now indisputably shares with that particular Turkish experience .\nThe consolidation of elite , oligarchic , managerial , bureaucratic , and ideological class interests at the apex of power , the casual equation of those \u201c progressive \u201d interests with the public good , the eagerness with which many ruling class representatives seek to manipulate and limit public discourse , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , traitorous , and unworthy of consideration\u2014with scant regard to the consequences of such framing\u2014suggest little willingness to accommodate .\nIndeed , among American elites , notions of prudence and tolerance have given way to a radical impulse to impose upon society\u2014for the people , in spite of the people .\nPerhaps the congressional elections in November will provide an opportunity for America \u2019 s Kemalists to take stock and reassess their trajectory .\nBut if the

Conservatives", "content": "Canada , at that time often called the Dominion of Canada , was founded on July 1 , 1867 , 155 years ago , with the passage of the British North America Act in the British House of Commons in London .\nIt was informally a union of two historic nations in the northern half of North America : the English Canadians and the French-Canadians ( mostly centered in Quebec ) .\nThe Aboriginal peoples were included , insofar as they were traditionally considered to be under the special protection of the Crown .\nIn 1867 , Canada was organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brunswick , and Nova Scotia\u2014each with local legislatures and Premiers , and a countrywide federal legislature and prime minister based in Ottawa .\nCanada later expanded to the ten provinces and three northern territories that constitute it today .\nThe prime minister is the head of the largest party , or a majority coalition of parties , in the Canadian House of Commons , where executive and legislative functions are conjoined .\nThe members of legislatures are elected from geographic electoral districts of roughly equal population ( though greatly varying territorial size ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first-past-the-post \u201d voting .\nThat means that the candidate with the largest number of votes ( even if that number is considerably less than 50 percent , given various \u201c third parties \u201d in contention ) wins the riding .\nThere is also a Senate that consists of appointed members , and is far weaker than the U.S. Senate .\nThe appointed governor general and provincial lieutenant governors are representatives of the monarch ( currently Queen Elizabeth II ) and give royal assent to legislation .\nThe various areas of federal and provincial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British North America Act .\nUntil 1896 , Canada was mostly dominated by the Conservatives/ \u201c Bleus , \u201d led by the illustrious statesmen Sir John A. Macdonald ( Canada \u2019 s first prime minister ) and Sir George-\u00c9tienne Cartier .\nThe Dominion of Canada , with its founding principles of \u201c peace , order , and good government , \u201d was profoundly anti-revolutionary .\nHowever , after 1896 , Canada has tended to elect Liberal governments , based on the overwhelming support of Quebec voters in federal elections .\nIn 1957 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , won a minority government , and , a year later , one of the largest majorities in Canadian history ( partially based on unusual support from Quebec voters ) .\nHowever , in 1962 , Diefenbaker \u2019 s majority was reduced to a minority government .\nThe federal election of 1963 was one of the most crucial in Canadian history .\nDiefenbaker faced Liberal Lester B. Pearson .\nAs aptly told by Canadian traditionalist philosopher George Grant , in his 1965 book , Lament for a Nation : The Defeat of Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managerial and pollster expertise of the North American capitalist classes , who resented Diefenbaker \u2019 s resistance to accepting U.S. nuclear weapons in Canada .\nPearson began a series of major reforms , the most symbolic of which was the replacement of the traditional Red Ensign with the maple-leaf design as the official flag of Canada .\n( The Red Ensign included the Union Jack in the upper left corner , as well as the shield of Canada \u2019 s traditional coat of arms , on a background of scarlet , royal red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debated at the time , many political theorists see the change of a country \u2019 s flag as a marker of \u201c regime change.\n\u201d This eventually became the case in Canada , especially with the ascendancy of Liberal Pierre Elliott Trudeau after 1968 , dubbed \u201c Trudeaumania.\n\u201d The term \u201c Dominion of Canada \u201d all but disappeared from official documents and was replaced by \u201c Government of Canada.\n\u201d Most countries identify themselves as a distinct realm ( whether a kingdom or republic ) , separate from the government .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal government apparatus in Canada today .\nEver since this transformative period , the Canadian right has been fighting one losing battle after another .\nOne of the central reasons for the Canadian right \u2019 s continuing failure since the 1960s has been the ongoing establishment of vast liberal-leaning media , juridical , academic , educational , bureaucratic , and corporate structures\u2014a nexus of interests that certain American and European critics have called \u201c the managerial-therapeutic regime \u201d \u2014which could be characterized as socially liberal and economically conservative .\nThese multifarious structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Trudeaupia.\n\u201d There is also the fact that \u201c North American \u201d pop-culture is the primary \u201c lived cultural reality \u201d for most people in Canada , which tends to reinforce socially liberal , consumerist/consumptionist , and antinomian attitudes , especially among the young .\nUnlike most other Western countries , where countervailing factors of various kinds exist to the hegemony of the managerial-therapeutic regime , current-day Canada probably is an example of such a managerial-therapeutic system in its \u201c purest \u201d form .\nIt could be argued that social , political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada\u2014lacking , in fact , either an authentic right or left\u2014has therefore become less subject to popular will and democratic input .\nIndeed , it could be called \u201c post-democratic.\n\u201d The lack of robust democratic participation and input in Canada should be of concern to theorists across the political spectrum .\nInsofar as the system maintains itself through massive \u201c prior constraint \u201d against a very broad array of ideas , beliefs , and opinions , its pretense of upholding democracy is questionable .\nSuch a profound lack of equilibrium is radically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form and exercise of democracy .\nCanada today may be seen as combining the most liberal aspects of America and Europe ; indeed , Canada may be ( apart from a few Scandinavian countries ) the world \u2019 s most liberal society .\nLike some European countries such as the Netherlands , Canada is extremely socially liberal , as demonstrated by the Canadian federal government \u2019 s total acceptance of same-sex marriage .\nAlthough a vote on the issue took place in the federal House of Commons in 2005 , it was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhat conservative critics call \u201c judicial activism \u201d is in Canada a comparatively late but now flourishing development , which only really got underway with the introduction of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms ( 1982 ) into the Canadian Constitution .\nThe Charter , clearly a left-liberal rather than classical liberal document , essentially enshrined virtually the entire agenda of Pierre Elliott Trudeau as the highest law of the land .\nAfter Brian Mulroney \u2019 s huge Progressive Conservative ( that was the official name of the party from 1942 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose record in regard to social and cultural conservatism was abysmal , Canada \u2019 s federal Liberal Party ( headed by Jean Chr\u00e9tien ) comfortably won the elections of 1993 , 1997 , and 2000 .\nLiberal Paul Martin Jr. was reduced to a minority government ( a plurality of seats in the House of Commons ) in 2004 .\nStephen Harper \u2019 s Conservative Party in power ( 2006-2015 ) tended towards centrism and moderation , despite the overheated rhetoric of his left-wing critics .\nThis was partly due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government in 2006-2011 , failing to win a majority in the 2006 and 2008 elections .\nHis majority government in 2011-2015 was also a disappointment for \u201c small-c conservatives \u201d ( the term by which more ideological conservatives in Canada are known\u2014as opposed to the \u201c big-C \u201d Conservative Party , which has been less ideologically conservative ) and social conservatives .\nIn any case , he failed to break the pattern of the almost-inevitable return of the Liberals to power .\nAnd he did nothing to dismantle or convert liberal redoubts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judiciary .\nJustin Trudeau ( Pierre \u2019 s son ) won a strong Liberal majority in 2015 .\nAlthough he was reduced to a minority government in the 2019 and 2021 federal elections , he still comfortably governed , mainly with the support of the New Democratic Party ( NDP ) , which is even further left .\n( There have been a fair number of \u201c third parties \u201d in Canadian history , of which the NDP is among the most prominent . )\nCanada has now embraced some of the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excesses of pop-culture , political correctness , and growing litigiousness .\nHowever , Canada lacks many aspects of America that may temper the aforementioned trends .\nSome of these countervailing factors in the United States include such things as the far greater importance of the military , the far greater presence of organized religion ( both in regard to fundamentalist Protestants and traditionalist Catholics ) , homeschooling as a major social trend , the existence of hundreds of traditional-leaning private colleges , and a large network of right-leaning think-tanks and publications .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition of independent-minded , left-wing , anti-corporate , ecological , or agrarian dissent , such as that typified by Ralph Nader , Christopher Lasch , Rachel Carson , Helen and Scott Nearing , and Wendell Berry .\nNevertheless , despite the better position of the right in America , any realistic assessment must note the increasing prominence of progressive elites in America , who have captured one institution after another .\nAmerica is the global center of \u201c political correctness.\n\u201d The Canadian medical system is stringently socialized to an extent unheard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical services do not require payment , the trade-off is that most medical care is subject to severe rationing , which in practice amounts to long delays .\nCanadians are not permitted to buy extra medical services , so wealthier persons often end up going to the United States for medical treatment .\nThere are now 1.3 million people in Ontario ( of a total population of about 14.5 million people ) without a family doctor .\nThe Canadian medical system is often seen as a central feature of \u201c Canadian values \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more compassionate , caring , and ethical , than the said-to-be morally indifferent United States .\nMany Canadians are willing to accede to virtually anything the government demands\u2014if they can only be assured of quality medical care .\nCanada \u2019 s control of its borders is also very lackadaisical .\nCanada has been characterized by very high rates of immigration , and has wholeheartedly embraced multiculturalism , affirmative action ( called \u201c employment equity \u201d in Canada ) , and diversity with startling intensity .\nCanada \u2019 s official immigration numbers were more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , per capita , for over three decades , and are now probably among the highest in the world .\nWith a population now reaching about 38 million persons , Canada had been receiving about a quarter-million immigrants every year .\n( The Liberals recently raised the numbers to 300,000 , and , in 2021 and coming years , to over 400,000 a year . )\nUnlike the United States , fundamentalist Christianity plays virtually no role in Canada .\nRelative to the United States , the debate about abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively closed .\nMoreover , Canada \u2019 s gun-control laws are also extremely strict ( at least as far as legal gun ownership ) .\nWhile there are incredibly onerous restrictions on legal gun ownership , the penalties for violent crimes committed with guns have been loosened up by Justin Trudeau , in contrast to Harper \u2019 s mandatory-minimum sentencing .\nIn another extreme contrast to the United States , in relation to its geographic size and NATO responsibilities , Canada has virtually no military ( the entire armed forces , including army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserves , number about 92,600 men and women ) and there is major disdain throughout much of Canadian society ( and especially among elites ) towards the military .\nIn practice , this weakness in international security has resulted in decades of morally and politically debilitating dependency on the United States .\nCanadians appear to be characterized both today and in their earlier history by an unusual deference to governmental authority .\nBefore 1965 , Canada probably was a substantively more conservative society than the United States ( in the better sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paradigm at the top has been fundamentally altered\u2014in the wake of the Pierre \u201c Trudeau revolution \u201d \u2014most Canadians are manifestly willing to follow the new , politically correct line from Ottawa .\nThere is virtually no heritage of independence , self-reliance , or belief in rambunctious free speech in Canada .\nIndeed , many Canadian officials and citizens point proudly to their aggressive and sweeping laws restricting freedom of expression under often too broadly defined \u201c hate speech \u201d laws as being highly necessary .\nThey often say they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricting freedom of speech .\nWhat may be said in Canada \u2019 s favor is that it is still a comparatively law-abiding and peaceful society , with a far more pleasant quality of life in Canadian large cities than is so in America \u2019 s cities .\nThe medical system , however imperfect , helps Canadians avoid the catastrophic personal medical costs frequently incurred in the U.S .\nHowever , Canada is changing in certain ways .\nFor example , the laws are enforced in increasingly asymmetrical ways , especially as regards protests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d of the perpetrators .\nIt could be concluded from the combination of points above that right-of-center positions are rarely seen or heard in Canada ( except perhaps in the Western Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan , as well as in the ambiguous case of the now mostly secular , French-speaking , Quebec nationalism , which , after the 1960s , has been frequently characterized by a powerful separatist movement ) .\nLeft-liberals predominate in the Canadian media ( especially in the taxpayer-funded CBC\u2014the \u201c BBC of Canada \u201d \u2014yet better described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NPR/PBS with the reach of America \u2019 s mainstream news networks ) .\nLeft-liberals also predominate in the education system ( from daycare to universities ) , in the judiciary and justice system , in the government bureaucracies , in so-called high culture ( typified by government-subsidized \u201c CanLit \u201d ) , in North American pop-culture and \u201c youth culture , \u201d in the big Canadian banks and corporations , and ( on most issues ) in the leaderships of the main churches in Canada .\nThe result is that any existing remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere is also the panoply of special-interest groups , who receive extensive government and corporate funding .\nThe social , political , and cultural situation of conservatives in Canada is desperate indeed .\nDecades of \u201c wearing down \u201d has resulted in the ever-more-limited ability of a conservative\u2014be he a social , political , or cultural conservative\u2014to participate and influence the Canadian polity .\nAnd participation in those debates is , after all , essential to democracy itself .", "author": "Mark Wegierski", "url":

6th century B.C.\n, Judea was at war with Babylon .\nTwice the forces of the empire laid siege to the Jewish capital at Jerusalem , as the disobedient vassal refused to pay tribute to the encroaching pagan power .\nAt the end of the second siege , Nebuchadnezzar \u2019 s armies burnt the temple to the ground and razed the city \u2019 s walls , dragging the starved and siege-wearied Jews in

back to the land that had been promised them\u2014allowing them , like all under his rule , to freely practice the religion of their fathers .\nIn Jerusalem , the long work of rebuilding the temple began ; in Babylon , the new emperor inscribed on a clay cylinder a decree announcing the return of captives to their homelands and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnanimous conqueror , of course , was Cyrus the Great .\nThe 2022 International Religious Freedom Summit convened in Washington this past week .\nAt a kickoff event on Monday morning , summit co-chair Katrina Lantos Swett invoked the Persian king

career devoted to the defense of human rights . )\nIn an interpretation stretching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she cast Cyrus \u2019 declaration as a very early predecessor of the modern tradition of religious liberty and universal rights .\nMeanwhile the summit \u2019 s other co-chair , Sam Brownback , described in his Monday morning remarks an innate hostility between government and religion .\n( Ambassador Brownback , genial and disarming , introduces himself as \u201c Sam.\n\u201d He represented Kansas in both the House and the Senate , then served as the state \u2019 s governor , before accepting President Trump \u2019 s appointment as ambassador-at-large for religious freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion , the ambassador said , because it gives people something to believe in that transcends and precedes the state .\nHe reiterated the point in front of the full summit crowd on Tuesday , with the additional prophecy that , \u201c Ultimately the kingdom of God will not be subdued by the kingdom of man.\n\u201d Does the history of free religious practice stretch back to the establishment of the world \u2019 s first imperial superpower , or is government by nature an enemy of religion ?\nThe former seems more plausible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by design neutralizes ( as best it can ) the sectarian and ethnic conflicts that endure in the absence of a unifying force like Cyrus .\nIn fact , it could be argued that a genuine liberty is only possible in the presence of a Cyrus figure , who dispels anarchy and furnishes the necessary conditions for freedom in practice .\nThough the language of religious freedom is intensely libertarian , the reality of religious freedom requires very high state capacity and a strong activist government .\nThis is just one among a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summit \u2019 s conveners and speakers chief among them , are still trying to work out .\nHand-in-hand with it is the tension between the abstract philosophy of rights and freedoms on the one hand , and the flesh-and-blood urgency of persecution on the other .\nPerhaps the most pressing case at present is Nigeria , where Islamic militants are committing horrific and persistent genocide against the Christian , especially Catholic , population .\nLike the Jews in Babylon , it may be that oppressed religious minorities today can only be delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the retired U.S. congressman from Virginia , understands this , calling for an empowered special envoy from the U.S. government to address the Nigerian crisis .\nAt present , however , the U.S. Department of State does not even list Nigeria among the Countries of Particular Concern .\nThough the human cost of genocide is more than enough to demand our attention , Nigeria is especially important in light of discussions of empire and religion , and of geopolitical realism .\nA conquest of the democratic and still-diverse country would provide radical Islam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus a gateway into sub-Saharan Africa .\nThe potential for such a passage to reshape balances of power and the global state of affairs can hardly be overstated .\nIn remarks heavy on foreign policy , Mike Pompeo quoted Alexis de Tocqueville : \u201c Liberty regards religion as its companion in all its battles and its triumphs.\n\u201d Swapping \u201c irreligion \u201d into the sentiment would render a rather shallow understanding of \u201c

HOLLYWOOD\u2014Here in California this past week , my city council voted to defund the sheriff \u2019 s department .\nBut West Hollywood isn \u2019 t the only American neighborhood that \u2019 s given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sheriffs at Mar-A-Lago also appear to be off duty .\nMy late mentor Mark Perry called Harry Truman \u201c more Democrat than American , \u201d in reference to the revulsion by the 33rd president to his successor , Dwight Eisenhower , joining forces with the GOP .\nBut Truman \u2019 s most notorious political observation extends properly to the party he hated : if you want a friend in Republican politics , get a dog .\nTwo months after former President Donald Trump looked to have the Midas touch , it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe \u2019 ve been here before , with doubters galore of this Donald Trump guy .\nBut , it should be said , it has not been quite like this in some six or seven years .\nLooking forward to 2024 , the Republican Party seems poised for another open presidential primary .\nThe stark , sudden reality on this front reportedly has Forty-Five ginned up to declare his intention to become Forty-Seven\u2014and right now , folks .\nWith late-millennial politicas denouncing the man in front of Congress , the Paladin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out through what he sees as shaping up to be a low , dishonest summer .\n\u201c They \u2019 re calling it the summer of Trump , \u201d the future president beamed in 2015 .\nIs 2022 about to be an encore ?\nNow , as then , Trump \u2019 s rivals do not care .\nThey were dead wrong seven years ago ; who \u2019 s right this time ?\nFor one , has anyone gotten smarter ?\nAre the alternatives to Trump anything more than \u201c Bush league \u201d ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Florida Governor Ron Desantis last week .\nThe intriguing ( if doomed ) prospect of a President Mike Pence will have to be saved for another .\nLet \u2019 s dive in now on what I \u2019 ll call the \u201c Republican third circuit.\n\u201d Governor Glenn Youngkin , of my native Virginia , is licking his chops to move to a ( slightly ) better river than the James in Richmond .\nIt was just as a Youngkin associate , wearing a Youngkin hat , told me in the snack shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor has Potomac fever .\nYoungkin would be the first president born in the Commonwealth since Woodrow Wilson , and only the second since before the state served as the damned headquarters of the wrong side of what Johnny Cash called our bloody brother war .\nVirginia , with some reason , feels it \u2019 s paid its dues for another turn at the White House .\nAnd the former Carlyle Group co-CEO feels like he knows how to spot an opportunity : maybe filming some sort of commercial geared at becoming commander-in-chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for donor confabs , and wading into nasty politics at the venerable Virginia Military Institute .\nYoungkin has put his posse on the board of the state military academy , sniffing a chance at a conservative comeback two years after our national Summer of Love .\nIt \u2019 s an interesting fight to pick\u2014one Youngkin evidently relishes : the fight over the schools .\nAs a former board member of a Virginia state university and product of the Commonwealth \u2019 s public schools , I can attest to this much of a Jeffersonian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t mess with education .\nLeft-wing overreach in the learning domain got Youngkin elected .\nAnd he \u2019 s hoping it could get him promoted 100 miles up North .\nHe \u2019 s no Trumpist , but Trumpists cheered his victory last autumn .\nYoungkin \u2019 s appeal is weirdly singular .\nSpeaking of military academies , a bonafide product of a citadel of our national defense would like to be president more than just about anybody .\nFormer Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2014originally of Orange County , but more notably of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 86 \u201d \u2014is showing every indication of , at least officially , running against his former boss .\nHe \u2019 s got ads out not in New York or California , but in Iowa and South Carolina .\nHe \u2019 s tanned , rested , and less enormous .\nNo one can outwork him .\nAnd speaking of The Citadel , former Palmetto State governor and Turtle Bay grandee Nikki Haley says not to count her out .\nI \u2019 ll bet big money she \u2019 s not the Republican nominee , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s not personally working to ward off recession through purchases of plane tickets to Iowa .\nThank you , Madam Ambassador .\nWhat the hell is going on ?\nTwo main theories .\nFirst : anyone not named Ron DeSantis is banking , contra 2016 , that a consolidated opponent to Trump will emerge before the primaries ( which are still a year and a half away ) and that it won \u2019 t , for whatever reason , be the Florida governor .\nBut , perhaps second : this tranche of players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Trump is actually remarkably bad at being enduringly petty .\nTrump-Youngkin 2024 ?\nTrump-Pompeo ?\nTrump-Haley ?\nAll more likely if they run .", "author": "Curt Mills", "url": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/is-glenn-youngkin-running-for-president/", "published": "Mon, 04 Jul 2022 04:01:08 +0000",

horrific reminder that the Biden administration \u2019 s open-border immigration policies continue to act as an irresistible magnet , pulling hundreds of thousands of migrants from countries around the world to risk life and limb in a dangerous journey to reach our porous southern frontier .\nThe supply of would-be migrants is inexhaustible : people who put themselves and family members , sometimes even unaccompanied children , in the hands of criminal smugglers in order to claw their way into the developed world .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal migrants still calculate their decision to travel based on the message they receive from the authorities in the destination country .\nAnd that message from the Biden administration is wholly irresponsible .\nEven in acknowledging the mass suffocation deaths , DHS Secretary Mayorkas , one of the chief architects of Biden \u2019 s destructive immigration policies , still refuses to use his megaphone to tell people not to come because they will be turned back .\nUnwilling to acknowledge any responsibility at all , Mayorkas tweeted : \u201c I am heartbroken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am praying for those still fighting for their lives .\nFar too many lives have been lost as individuals \u2013 including families , women , and children \u2013 take this dangerous journey.\n\u201d Mayorkas knows they take this \u201c dangerous journey \u201d because Biden \u2019 s policies hold out the promise of gaining entry into the U.S .\nIn another era , genuine humanitarian voices on the left might have called out Mayorkas \u2019 s hypocrisy , but for those who want to harness open-border policies to remake the world , immigration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how much it undermines the rule of law or disrupts families and communities , or , indeed , who dies along the way .\nInstead of acknowledging responsibility for stoking clandestine immigration and the resulting chaos and death it causes , the Biden administration has gone full speed ahead , blurring the distinction between legal and illegal entry .\nAs if current U.S. legal quotas , welcoming approximately one million annual immigrants , were not generous enough , many in the Biden administration are hell-bent on luring and admitting hundreds of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a \u201c dangerous journey \u201d to our southern border .\nOnce these migrants reach the border , the Biden administration twists existing federal statutes , using such schemes as \u201c catch and release \u201d and distorting concepts like \u201c public-interest parole , \u201d to allow them to remain in the country .\nIt is more than sobering to see a president callously undermine due process , in effect telling lawful immigrants and their families in the U.S. , who may have waited years for legal admission , that the rule of law in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beyond their impact on the United States , another result of these lawless immigration policies is the emergence of massive international criminal-smuggling networks , which move people as chattel .\nIt is not yet documented , but it is likely that during the Biden administration human smuggling has become even more profitable a criminal enterprise than illicit narcotics trafficking into the U.S .\nSuch smuggling networks are responsible for countless unrecorded cases of human trafficking , extortion , disappearances , and death .\nClandestine migration is not a victimless crime , and Mayorkas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for these tragedies .\nOne lie often repeated about our globalized world is the claim that unrestrained immigration is not only desirable , but inevitable .\nBut even a superficial comparison between Trump and Biden \u2019 s border policies makes clear that a sustained and enforced message from the White House that the United States is not open to illegal migrants has far-reaching consequences .\nDeaths and disappearances of clandestine migrants in the Americas rose from 798 in the final year of the Trump administration to 1,248 in Biden \u2019 s first year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the International Organization for Migration\u2014no Trump ally\u2014on migrants worldwide moving into and across the Americas , most if not all of whom intend to enter the U.S .\nThis increase in fatalities directly reflects migrants \u2019 decisions to travel based on open-border policies Biden announced to the world upon his arrival in the White House .\nIf a president uses his bully pulpit and backs up his word with consequential border-security policies , his message will spread everywhere , from teeming cities in Pakistan to isolated hamlets in Ecuador .\nA truly humanitarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our border , but would convince them there is a legal process or no process at all .\nSecretary Mayorkas should explain why his broken heart does not move him to advocate for a change to Biden \u2019 s anti-humanitarian immigration policies .\nPhillip Linderman is a retired career diplomat whose work for
