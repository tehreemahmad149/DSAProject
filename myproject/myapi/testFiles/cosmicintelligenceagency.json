January 2nd 2022 at 18:33 UTC", "content": "\u2026 the travellers could see for the first time what sort of place they were in .\nIt was a valley through which a broad swift river wound its way , flowing eastwards towards the sun .\nSouth was there were mountains northwards there were lower hills , but it was a valley of mere earth , rock and water ; there was not a tree not a bush , not a blade of grass to be seen .\nThe earth was many of colours : they were fresh and hot and vivid .\nThey made you feel excited until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you forgot everything else .\nAnd the eastern sky changed from white to pink and from pink to gold and the voice rose and rose to all the air was shaking with us .\nAnd it just swelled the mightiest and most glorious sounded ever produced , the sun arose .\nFar away , and down near the horizon , the sky began to turn grey .\nA light wind , very fresh , began to stir .\nThe sky in that one place grew slowly and steadily paler .\nYou could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and all the time the voice went on singing .\nAnd the voice on the earth was no louder and more triumphant , but the voices in the sky after singing loudly with it for a time began to get faint .\nNo something else was happening .\nThen two wonders happened at the same moment .\nOne was that the voice was suddenly joined by the other voices , more voices than you could possibly count .\nThey were in harmony with it , but far higher up the scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second wonder was the blackness overhead all at once was the blazing with stars .\nIt didn \u2019 t come out gently one by one , as they do on a summer \u2019 s evening .\nOne moment there had been nothing but darkness ; next moment thousand , thousand points of Light leaped out \u2013 single stars , constellations and planets brighter and bigger than any in our world .\nThere were no clouds .\nThe new stars and the new voices began at the same time .\nIf you had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you would have felt quite certain that it was the stars themselves which were singing and that it was the first voice the deep one , which had made them appear and made them sing\u2026 \u201c In the darkness , something was happening .\nA voice and began to sing .\nIt was very far away .\nAnd Digory found it hard to decide from what direction it was coming .\nSometimes it seemed to come from all directions at once .\nSometimes he almost thought it was coming out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were deep enough to be the voice of the earth herself .\nThere were no words .\nThere was hardly even a tune .\nBut it was beyond comparison , the most beautiful noise he had ever heard .\nIt was so beautiful he could hardly bear it\u2026 His mane-like hair still wet having recently descended out of the ocean above ; syrinx pressed gently to his lips , the land stirring from its slumber as the fresh ionised air fills the wild , unpopulated mountains with beautiful , haunting Phrygian sounds ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the tree line , a young satyr waits patiently for Nature to awaken as his flattened cadence is carried far and wide in the wind , quietly beckoning and encouraging Her to rise up .\nLargely forgotten by a world no longer connected to the land , his song sounds melancholy and foreboding , rather than enticing and coaxing , descending deep into the Dark to enliven and awaken the nascent potential that lies above and below .\nFittingly , he was the first \u2018 being \u2019 to be met in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a Daughter of Eve , Lucy , in the Narnia chronicles , and a mediator between two different worlds , as also symbolised by his theriomorphic appearance .\nAs a metaphor of the profound ability that consciousness has to bring forth creation into physical expression , the Satyr was appropriated by the Greek tradition from a creature no longer extant \u2013 the seagoat .\nYes , you would be right to question whether such a creature ever existed , after all why would an animal known for its ability to climb crags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fish ?\nIt is said that above those lofty , peaky bridges lies waters above us , diving through which we are awashed of pre-incarnate memory before birthing into this world .\nThe sea-goat therefore is a depiction of our incarnate hunger to bring forth from the fertile liminal imaginative realms , a tonal vibration that awakens our body and therefore our physical world .\nThe glyph of the Sign of Capricorn retains this contrast within its symbolism , as the waters above cascade into the world below \u2013 In the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a note from heaven\u2026 This tone is one that can be experienced within but not heard .\nIt is that sound that is ever present when we fall out of this world each night as we sleep , deeply remembered in our bodies and awakened as that profoundly enchanting experience of music .\nIn music you feel the echoes of eternity weaving and creating from the inner most core of your being , because you are not purely a physical being , but someone who is encased by a physical sleeve .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hellenistic adaptation of this \u2018 Enki-like \u2019 Mas , mesmerises our consciousness , creating a dream-like amphitheatre , enabling us to consciously return to those ethereal waters , from which we are soaked in fecund images that enable us to create afresh , when we return back to earth after the sound dissipates .\nBut do you take the time to listen to the enchanting sound that lies within , or have you been so sanitised by repetitious three chord rifts and commercial orientated lyrics that your soul no longer hears the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the element of Air , the mind , Nature is calling .\nRemember the stillness of April 2020 when the Western-Americanised world paused ; the clarity and pitch of songs of the birds ; the hum of the bee and the whisper of the wind ; how you made a commitment to turning off a screen and walk in Nature ; how Nature thrived without the busyness of commercial activity ; and how enchanted you were by it all and how you made a commitment to living a simpler life , one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fresh water and plenty of time outdoors ?\nThat is the deeper message of the Capricorn Council of January 2020 , as Gaia spoke forth .\nBut like Uncle Andrew from the Narnia chronicles , a character who was disturbed by the \u2018 noise \u2019 of nature , are you refusing to listen to the sonorous tones of the voice that is experienced but not heard ?\nAre you taking time to connect to the fertile imagination of the ocean above us and drawing it down and into your physical being to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Capricorn figurine of the Satyr does ?\nIn the calm within the storm that is 2022 , you will be called upon to look at the note from which you can enchant your world .\nAs the New Moon of January 2nd echoes the story of the 12th of January 2020 redistribution of power synod , reflecting on whether your body is consonant or dissonant with Nature \u2019 s song is something I feel is of key importance .\nIn other words , are you living in sync with your body \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or are you trusting in an external agency for your health and wellbeing , as would appear to be the encouragement of others attempting to steer the direction of this epochal redistribution of power ?\nAre you forgetting your sea-goat , or satyr nature ?\nAre you in touch with the Cardinal Earth , or Capricorn , within you ?\nThe time is now to re-animate this forlorn being within you .\nHappy start to the calendar year 2022 to you and those you love and here is to the creation of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall health and well-being in a conscious and purposeful manner .\nAfter all what is within will be reflected in the without .",

"Venus in all her movements and when keyed into her ongoing star points is most interesting to follow as she has macro and micro cycles , also well known to reflect the cosmic relationship of the Phi ratios and the fibonacci sequence , reflecting to us natural cycles of growth , unfolding , personal and collective evolution as well as beauty , aesthetics and the spirals of creation in our universe .\nRanging from the TRANSIT cycles of 248 years , ** to the approx 100 year retrogradation of each star point through a sign , to every 8 year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year synodic cycle , and down to every 9.5 month star point , no matter where we look we can see her divine patterns unfolding in our creation story .\n( 1 ) More on the 2020 Venus Transit Here https : //cosmicintelligenceagency.com/the-transit-of-venus-2012/ To look at Venus cycles through her Star Points is to consider each loop as part of something greater , part of the whole of what she does , not just one isolated loop or retrograde , but a part of the larger ongoing magical cycle she reflects .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our astrology charts , every 9.5 month , every 1.6 years , every 4 years , every 8 years is a cosmic , fractal spiral , forever connecting , renewing , reviewing our pattern of evolution and progress , setting off new patterns of growth , as experience and life enter new information and feed it back into the never-ending feedback loop .\nImagine our astrology charts being the initial conditions set off by a fractal formula , our unique formula or fractal mandala .\nOnce in motion , nothing ever stays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consciousness , information is added , the pattern changes slightly or goes off into new streams , yet the original pattern , our natal chart always remains magically held within .\nCheck out some animated fractals on you tube and you \u2019 ll get the idea .\nNow imagine that as your astrological mandala , looping and turning and twisting , yet always recognisable , as your unique astrology chart !\nI \u2019 ve seen astrology working like a fractal now for some time , and find it a very good reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put back into our feedback loop , when we see a particular alignment coming .\nThis is of course relevant for all cycles , slower or faster , but none are quite as elegant , timely or creatively consistent as that of the cycle of Venus .\nIn true Venusian symbolism , she balances and perfects , she harmonises and collects that which we are most attracted to .\nShe connects our story in the 5 places or what I call Star Point Zones that the star points occur in , in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 , 8,12 and even up to 16 years , to make a point ( depending on what orbs one would use ) to help show us where things could be better balanced , to help align us with getting more out of life , with what we want and love and with what needs letting go of , or said goodbye too .\nAs we look at these Venus Point Zones , if we do the homework , as each point comes along , look back 4 , 8 , 12 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just the 8 year loops of retrograde returns , but also when Venus was there in the opposite apparition , 4 years prior .\nWatch my introduction video to The Venus Star on Your tube \u2013 https : //www.youtube.com/watch ?\nv=FVZd3leV28Q It is from this that working with the Venus star as a whole has become part of my work and consultations , always aware of where the 5 star points are .\nThe star points move slowly backwards in our charts and in our lifetimes .\nSo for about 40 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 10 degrees , for 80 years of life about 20 degrees .\nWe can easily plot the star point zone in our charts by first finding the 5 star points around our birth , 2 years prior and 2 years after , and continue to where they are now , to see an area that is your Venus Star Zone .\nWhat houses , angles and planets has the Venus Star landed on for you over the years ?\nLike many things in a astrology it is quite profound to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , see where she is going next .\nAs we know what happens this time , won \u2019 t be quite the same as what happens next time , as we have grown , other planets have moved yet the pattern still remains , and 4 years on we also get a view and experience from the other side !\n.\nThe Fibonacci sequence and Golden ratio is reflected in the Venus cycle holding the 1.6 ratio .\n1 Earth year 365 days , 1 Venus Cycle 584 = 1.6 5 synodic cycles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 revolutions in 8 years 8/13 = 1.6 For example as we move toward this Capricorn retrograde point , consider what was happening in January 2014 ( and leading up t and after the exact star point ) but also in January 2018 when this point was made with the outer conjunction of Venus and the Sun , as well as go back to 2010 , 2006 and so on , as the star points , repeat every 4 years in the same place of the zodiac , slowly moving backwards over time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repeat as outer conjunctions 4 years late .\nIn my work I have come to see each star point inner or outer as significant as the other .\nAstrologers tend to focus mostly on the retrograde and the Venus returns of 8 years , yet considering the midpoint in the cycle can reveal much more to us about what happens here .\nThe Moon too does this !\nIf we look at any new Moon , we know 4 years later ( give or take a degree or 2 ) there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThen 4 years later again another new moon occurs in the same degrees .\nAs the Venus point oscillates from inner and outer conjunctions over the 4 year periods we get a different view of the same picture , another perspective on similar themes in our astrology charts as each star point comes around every 9.5months .\nTake a good look to help inform you of what was going on as part of your greater 8 year cycle.\n!\nSo as we get ready for the next loop , let \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this next loop brings , keeping in mind some personal research from above !\nLike the Moon , Venus waxes and wanes , grows in light , ascend and descends and disappears into the light of the Sun , not only once like the Moon , yet twice during her inner and outer conjunctions .\nSince Galileo \u2019 s discoveries through his telescopes we know that Venus has phases , and these days for many practising astrologers looking at , and knowing our Venus phase has become quite significant .\nLike knowing our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 19 month synodic loop our Venus was when we were born , giving more detail and archetypal clarity to our particular Venus , not just by sign , house and aspect but now also by phase .\nAs Venus retrograde in Capricorn bridges 2021 \u2013 2022 \u2013 The Star Point , the Venus Sun conjunction shows the midpoint of the retrograde and the end of the past 19 month cycle and the begining of the next one .\nMoving retrograde for 14\u00b0 degrees , over 40 days/40 night the retrograde passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venus falls to earth so to speak , bringing down her wisdom of the past cycle , letting go and shedding the unwanted past what will now begin her new heroines journey .\nWith Venus retrograde and under the Sun \u2019 s beams , many astrologers point to the retrograde as \u201c Her Journey to the underworld \u201d yet it is the outer conjunction that points to the myth of descent to the unknown , and her furthest passage away from earth .\nIn the retrograde pass Venus will only disappears for 8-10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjunction , she disappears for 60-80 days and takes 7 months and 7 waning Moon gates to get there after her max elongation .\nThis is what the descent of Inanna and Venus is all about .\nThe 40 day 40 night retrograde , is a re-set , re-view , re-alignment , and a great preparation for the long trial journey ahead , the next 19 month great mission , I like to say to the Underworld or Upperworld , as either could apply !\nThe Morning Star phase is the descent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the ascent out of the underworld .\nReflect on the past 19 month cycle as we get ready to birth the New Venus Star and the next 19 month cycle , that begins on January the 9th , 2022 at 18\u00b0 45\u2032 Capricorn , after which Venus the crescent of Venus rises as the morning star once again .\nFind this new Venus Star place , 19\u00b0 Capricorn , in your astrology chart , check what house it is in and what aspects it makes .\nReflect back in 4 year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2018 and Jan 2014 , 2010 , 2006 etc to gather the intell on what this star point is about for you , now upgrading to the next phase of your Venusian evolution !\nUse the image above , to keep track of the keypoints in the coming cycle : There has been some debate in our community over the years as to where the cycle of Venus actually begins .\nThe sky watcher shamanic astrologers would say that the cycle begins with the heliacal rising of Venus as she rises as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astrologers would say , that the cycle begins with Venus rising as an evening star in the west .\nThe reasoning for the latter is that Venus at this part of her cycle is low in the sky , dim , is ascending and from here gains in light , as she also appears like the Moon does when new , in the western evening sky !\nThere a a few things to consider here , with both of the above viewpoints .\nThe shamanic way , is a delight to follow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much more difficult to co-ordinate , as the rise can happen at slightly different times and days , depending on place , atmosphere and latitudes and is not so simply found by an ephemeris , yet some software is rectifying this .\nYet with the shamanic viewpoint and the visual sky gaining importance in our astrology circles this is indeed a practice that I see as important to be followed and even encouraged as it teaches us so much more about the living sky .\nFrom the ancient Babylonians to the Mayans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that the heliacal rise ( rising out of the Sun \u2019 s beams ) of the planets and stars as always being most significant .\nYet it is much easier and direct to work out phases and co-ordinate timing by using the exact Star Point .\nOne thing that makes no sense to me with the more traditional method , and also perhaps as they were devised before the discovery of Venus \u2019 phases by Galileo , is that to consider Venus as an evening star , rising in the west as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh new Moon does , simply makes no sense .\nThe Moon orbits the Earth and Venus orbits the Sun .\nTheir meeting point with the Earth , for the Moon is a New Moon , and is why it makes sense as the reason for Venus \u2019 newness , as she transits between Earth and Sun , not when she rises out of the outer conjunction , but when she moves off to the east to become the morning star !\nWith the retrograde of Venus in Capricorn and as the Venus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light again as morning star , we are set off on a new Capricorn themed cycle .\nA cycle that begins with reconnecting and reevaluating Capricorn themes in our lives , shown by what house and aspects the retrograde and star point have made .\nCAPRICORN represents our achievements , ambitions , acknowledgments , responsibilities and how we live by the law and its implementation on us , our relationship to those that govern us \u2013 parties , politicians , their accountability , transparency , those in power to distribute our rules and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected by how the rights of citizens have changed so much during the pandemic outbreak , and the need for vaccine passports and living by new mandates in this opening to the new Aquarian Age ?\nCapricorn themes also bring those in leadership , our elite and looked up too into the spotlight .\nWe can expect a fall form grace from some and a reshuffle of leadership in the months to come .\nAs the Venus retrograde began conjunct Pluto and Ghisliane Maxwell , former socialite went to trail and was convicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child sex trafficking , implicating also royal Prince Andrew .\nGhisliane \u2019 s astrology chart shows the Capricorn star point in her 8th house , and Pluto transiting herSaturn , where the current Venus retrograde began , For Prince Andrew , the Capricorn star point square his MC from the 6th house , as Jupiter transits hi Pisces Sun and the 8th house .\nNovak Djokovic another celebrity in the spotlight at this time , being denied a visa to enter Australia for his much loves Australian Open tournament which he has won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no medical exemption , which are the requirements to enter the tournament .\nn. The Venus Star Point joins his ASC , with quite a few other factors playing out in his astro chart at this time .\nRE-evaluate , re-assign , re-work , re-value , re-do , re-source re-adjust life according to to your values Updates Dig deep for what will rise strike , saying no , saying yes , turning points not the same as it ever was rise against establishment mandates for vaxx The Magic Is In Your Hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the past , we activate each phase with purpose and growth and mostly by looking ahead .\nWe know there is nothing like astrology to connect us to the past , present and future , and there is nothing like the Venus star and the Venus cycle , the grand pentagon and the magic pentacle to keep our astrology truly alive and activated .\nTake the time during this retrograde to do some work with the Venus Star and the Venus cycle , see how she tells your ongoing story of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at every keypoint she synthesises and brings together the essence of the 5 months before and the 5 months after each star point is made .\nGet into the rhythm , see the patterns and by all means create some new ones .\nMay the magic be revealed in your exploration !\nIn every chart I always see five extra points !\n*****", "author": "AGENT 12 - JULIJA SIMAS", "url": "https://cosmicintelligenceagency.com/the-next-venus-star-loop-2022-2023/", "published": "Thu, 06 Jan

"2022-01-13", "source": "cosmicintelligenceagency", "title": "The Sunspot Cycle,  Magnetic Field, Venus-Sun Inferior Conjunctions and Pandemics", "content": "There has been some research on the relations between the inferior conjunctions of Venus and the influenza pandemics that emerged in the 20th century .\nSome research I read years ago has clearly stated that inferior conjunctions of Venus were directly related to pandemics .\nThe inferior conjunction of Venus with the Sun occurs every 583.9 days which is approximately every 1.6 years .\nOf course , we do not experience a pandemic in each inferior conjunction of Venus !\nHowever , solar winds which are active during such conjunctions are determinants on this theme .\nI have emphasised this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and solar activities in my book Maximum which was published in 2012 .\nUnder the title Venus Ingress in 2012 and Our Health , I underlined , \u201c Some scientists claim that the virus that causes endemic flu emanates from Venus .\nDonald Barber from Norman Lockyer Observatory in Britain stated that some fungi-type bacteria that emanated from rainwater were linked with the Venus\u2013Sun inferior conjunction .\nBarber also stated that six major epidemic diseases emerged 55 days after the geomagnetic storms that followed the Venus\u2013Sun inferior conjunction .\nTo summarize these scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar activities , Venus\u2013Earth\u2013Sun alignments also cause solar flares .\nAs the magnetic field of Venus is too weak , ionized gases from its upper atmosphere leave the plane due to solar storms .\nThe bacterial colonies in these layers reach the Earth \u2019 s atmosphere during the planetary alignment .\nThe viruses , which disseminate through the air from the poles , then cause flu epidemics around the world .\nWe are now reaching the solar maximum phase , where we will experience increased magnetic currents .\nBecause Venus \u2019 s plasma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during this interaction , the possibilities for virus contagion will increase .\nThroughout history , flu virus mutations and other pandemics were linked with sun spot maximums .\nFor example , following the sun spot maximum in 1917 , the Spanish Flu pandemic started in 1918 \u201d .\n[ 1 ] When compared with the Earth , Venus has a much weaker magnetic field .\nIt means , solar winds may deteriorate its atmosphere directly and blow its tail like upper atmosphere .\nAlthough it is not seen with naked eye , Venus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn his article The Interaction of the Solar Wind with Venus , Russell Vaisberg tells , \u201c While the Venus ionosphere , rather than magnetosphere as on the earth , deflects the solar wind flow , this deflection is accomplished with the deformation of a bow shock which heats and compresses the solar wind flow , and is closer to the planet and weaker than would be expected for an ideal gas dynamic interaction with a perfectly reflecting obstacle .\nThe ionized magneto sheath flow can interact directly with the neutral atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the flow , and photoionization ; both processes adding mass to the solar wind because the high altitude neutral atmosphere is mostly composed of oxygen rather than hydrogen .\nThe magneto tail of Venus also differs from that of the earth in that the mass loading of the magneto sheath flow slows the transport of magnetic flux tubes past the planet , while the ends of the tubes continue to travel rapidly in the solar wind , so that the planet accretes interplanetary magnetic flux .\n[ 2 ] Does Virus come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wickramasinghe , flu outbreaks are often caused by new viruses from space .\nBased on a theory , the worst influenza outbreaks peak in correlation with sunspot activities of eleven years .\nAlthough particles are scattered all around the world , they are spread by people in places with high population and therefore , the probability of transmission increases .\nThe shortest interval between the geomagnetic storms and pandemics is 35 days , while the longest interval is 67 days .\n[ 3 ] Scientist Donald R.Barber claimed that bacteria reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winds from the upper atmosphere of Venus .\n[ 4 ] Another scientist Joseph Norman Lockyer stated they that bacteria reach the ground from the in England through the north-west winds coming from North Polar Region .\n[ 5 ] Therefore , virus spreads quickly because of being transmitted by the winds of by the people .\nIn the region where outbreaks occur , if there is no reason for virus impact , then it is possible that influenza may occur due to the influence of Venus .\nIn an article written by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is told that in a letter to The Lancet medical journal , Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe of Cardiff University suggests SARS virus might be introduced to Earth by a comet or meteorite .\nHe points to other mysterious modern epidemics like the Plague of Athens and the influenza pandemic of 1917-19 as also originating from the skies .\n[ 6 ] In the article titled \u201c On the Possibility of microbiota transfer from Venus to Earth \u201d written by N.C.Wickramasinghe and J.T .\nWickramasinghe it is stated that the action of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the atmosphere laden with aerosols and putative microorganisms , forming a comet-like tail in the antisolar direction .\nAs stated by the research , during inferior conjunctions that coincide with transits of the planet Venus this comet-like tail intersects the Earth \u2019 s magnetopause and injects aerosol particles .\n[ 7 ] Let \u2019 s have a look at the biggest outbreaks which occurred around the dates of Venus-Sun inferior conjunction .\nVenus-Sun inferior conjunction occurred on May 26 , 1518 .\nWith the Smallpox epidemic began in the end of 1518 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 to 8 million people perished .\nVenus-Sun inferior conjunction occurred on February 9 , 1918 and Spanish Flu emerged on March 11 , 1918 .\nVenus-Sun inferior conjunction occurred on June 21 , 1956 .\nAsian Flu , which emerged in Moscow in October 1956 , spread to countries worldwide after February 1957 .\nVenus-Sun inferior conjunction occurred on June 13 , 1988 .\nHuman Influenza A ( H1N2 ) was seen in China between December 1988 and March 1989 .\nVenus-Sun inferior conjunction occurred on April 2 , 1993 .\nHanta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferior conjunction occurred on August 18 , 2007 .\nA flu outbreak was seen in Australia on these days .\nFollowing the conjunction , Zika Virus emerged in April in the same year .\nVenus-Sun inferior conjunction occurred on March 27 , 2009 .\nSwine Influenza A ( H1N1 ) was seen in human in March 2009 .\nVenus-Sun inferior conjunction occurred on June 6 , 2012 .\nThe first MERS case was seen on April 2012 ( or on June some claims ) and the outbreak spread to 26 countries by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that COVID-19 emerged on December 1 , 2019 .\nThe last Venus-Sun inferior conjunction occurred on October 26 , 2018 .\nIt seems to be a long time between these days .\nAnd again , we will experience another Venus-Sun inferior conjunction on June 3 , 2020 and before this conjunction , we will have a New Moon on May 22 , 2020 .\nI will give details about that coming conjunction at the end of my article .\nBy the way , COVID-19 is a type of Coronavirus .\nIn astronomy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun , resembling a crown .\nDo you think it is a coincidence that Coronavirus has entered our lives during the transition period to the deep Solar Minimum cycle ?\nAccording to some scientists , minima in the sunspot cycle present conditions conducive to the entry or activation of new pathogens and also for mutations of already circulating bacteria and viruses .\nThree grand minima of solar activity on record\u2013the Sporer minimum ( 1450-1550 AD ) , Maunder minimum ( 1650-1700 AD ) and the Dalton minimum ( 1800-1830 ) have all been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , English Sweats , Plague and Cholera .\nThe sunspot numbers recorded for the present period 2002-2017 include the deepest sunspot minimum ( Cycle 23-24 ) since records began , and a trend to declining numbers throughout the cycle .\nThe same period has seen the resurgence of several pandemics\u2013SARS , MERS , Zika , Ebola , Influenza A .\nWe consider it prudent to take note of these facts whilst planning future strategies for pandemic surveillance and control .\n[ 8 ] The possibility of linking sunspots with pandemics was first suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many pandemics of influenza in history occurred close to times of sunspot maxima .\nMaxima in the sunspot cycle are characterized by high daily sunspot numbers , frequent solar flares , coronal discharges and X-ray emission .\nSunspot minima are characterized by a weakening of the interplanetary magnetic field near the Earth , which allows for the entry of Galactic Cosmic Rays as well as electrically charged bacteria and viruses to the Earth and other microscopic biological entities can penetrate the interplanetary magnetic field barrier and reach the stratosphere .\nIt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first descent of viral-sized particles deposited in the stratosphere will occur at places where the stratosphere is thinnest ; and by this argument populated areas of China lying eastward of the Himalayan mountain range would present the best candidates .\nIt is therefore not surprising to find that first strikes of new or renewed viral diseases are often recorded in China .\nAccording to some scientists , from past records of the correlation of the sunspot cycle ( prolonged minima ) and pandemics it is clear that the onset of a deep minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have stated elsewhere that the sunspot cycle could be a guide for closer scrutiny of circulating viruses , and monitoring their genetic variations .\n[ 9 ] In my book Maximum , published in 2012 , I have stated that the decrease in solar activities had some negative influences on human health and connections with fatal outbreaks : \u201c According to Solco W. Tromp , if we are not stimulated by the Sun we may experience health problems .\nOur life is restricted during low solar activities .\nColonel C.A .\nGill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic diseases increase during minimal sun spot activity periods .\nGill proved that all malaria cases occurred during low sun spot activities .\nAccording to Dr. Conyers Morrel , epidemic diseases were highly related with sun spot cycles .\nDiphtheria , tetanus and dysentery are triggered when there are no sun spots.\n\u201d [ 10 ] As I stated in the book \u201c Ba\u015flang\u0131\u00e7 2020 \u201d a co-authored book in Turkish , \u201c Based on some prediction techniques , scientists state that the existing Solar Minimum will reach its deepest point in April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will reach a new Solar Maximum in July 2025 \u201d .\n[ 11 ] It means , within the period between April 2020 and October 2020 , we will experience the deepest point of the existing Solar Minimum .\nIt is also stated that its trough will be experienced in 2022 .\nCoronavirus could turn to global pandemic as freak solar minimum means outbreak \u2018 imminent \u2019 Lead author Chandra Wickramasinghe of the Buckingham Centre for Astrobiology has already stated that a global virus pandemic was imminent .\nIn his article published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; \u201c The \u201c deepest sunspot minimum \u201d for more than a century is about to force the Sun into partial hibernation , they say .\nPublic health authorities have been warned to be vigilant with the phenomenon linked to historic viral pandemics .\nPreviously unseen strains could emerge through the coming months while existing ones turn super-virulent , according to a report in Current Science .\nOn the basis of sunspot numbers , this could have serious consequences globally during the coming months .\nThe solar slump is causing the Earth \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biological entities \u201d including DNA to fall to the planet \u2019 s surface .\nScientists believe infective agents originating from comets and other planets inhabit near space in a type of soup \u2013 the so-called panspermia theory .\nWhile they can naturally drift towards Earth , they are largely held at bay by magnetic fields which are strengthened by solar activity .\nThe imminent reduction in solar activity will knock a chink in this armour while \u201c opening the floodgates \u201d to a \u201c flux of cosmic rays \u201d .\nThese rays threaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and viruses already present , creating super-virulent versions .\nThere are two problems we fear may arise : Biological entities can penetrate the weakened magnetic field under these circumstances to a much greater degree than under normal conditions .\nSo we could see new , potentially deadly viruses , emerge on Earth after these floodgates are opened .\nAnother aspect is mutations induced by cosmic rays in biological infectious agents already here , this could give them new characteristics and making then super-virulent .\nIt would be prudent for public health authorities the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any necessary action .\nPrevious viral pandemics have coincided with periods of low solar activity although scientists have struggled to find a definitive link .\nHowever they now think the effect of the sun on magnetic fields affects solar winds and the flow of charged particles including bacteria and viruses .\nNow , with space exploration and continuous monitoring of space weather , it is evident that the Earth \u2019 s magnetosphere and the interplanetary magnetic field in its vicinity are modulated by the solar wind that in turn controls the flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There appears to be a case for expecting new viral strains to emerge over the coming months.\n\u201d [ 12 ] We should also consider that the lowest interplanetary magnetic field values are recorded .\nWeakening in the Earth \u2019 s magnetic field also has an influence here .\nVirions , phages , bacteria and other microorganism also weaken the interplanetary magnetic field and inevitably help electrically charged new pathogens reach the surface of the Earth easily .\nLow or zero magnetic fields bring mutations as well .\nAlthough experts do not especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they tell that the low magnetic field caused by the decrease in the number of sunspots may engender emanation of new viruses .\nAs I stated in the book Ba\u015flang\u0131\u00e7 2020 , \u201c The reason for the changes in climate and economics or the spiritual changes we observe nowadays , is not only the changing magnetic fields but also the increasing number of cosmic rays .\nAs the magnetic field of the Earth weakens rapidly , we are less protected from the harmful rays coming from the outer space.\n\u201d [ 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same book , \u201c The changes in the intensity of the Earth \u2019 s magnetic field may also be regional and bring changes related to the health of the people living in certain placed of the world .\nIn 2015 , Zika virus outbreak began in Mexico when the magnetic field there weakened strikingly .\nWe may conclude that the virus attack was seen because solar activity decreased , magnetic field is weakened and so harmful rays and other particles from outer space reached the lower layers of our atmosphere more effectively .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of ZIKA attack cosmic rays seems to be related to low solar activities and consequently weakening magnetic field intensity .\nIt is a warning for us for the future pandemics .\nThat means , even if a solution is found for Coronavirus , other viruses and pandemics may be in our agenda in the near future .\nWe must be prepared for this since we are in a period of time when the solar activities decrease and the magnetic field weakens.\n\u201d [ 14 ] I would like to share a paragraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 \u201d , a co-authored book in Turkish : \u201c We will experience a Venus-Sun inferior conjunction on June 3 , 2020 .\nVenus will be transiting in Gemini , which is associated with the lungs and respiratory tracks in medical astrology .\nGemini is associated with breathing and it is also the sign which gives quick reactions , so it indicates spasmodic respiratory disorders and especially the diseases of the upper lobs \u0131f the lungs .\nGemini is also associated with travelling .\nIn June , during Venus transit in Gemini , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTokyo Olympics is one of the biggest organizations where numerous people will gather in the summer of 2020 .\nSuch crowded places may be dangerous in terms of air-borne diseases .\nSo , special attention should be paid.\n\u201d After the book has been published , Tokyo Olympics have been cancelled .\nIt was absolutely the right decision !\nVarious activities where lots of people attend including sport activities , concerts and congressed have all been cancelled .\nWe should also be careful about Coronavirus threat during Venus retrograde in Gemini .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of journeys may bring losses .\nThe number of infested people and the number of hospitalization may increase .\nTherefore , we should attach special importance to isolation and keep in quarantine between the second half of the May and the end of June , we should not travel unless it is obligatory , we should not remain in crowded places and we should not be in face-to-face communication with the others and care about social distancing .\nAs I stated in my previous article , Jupiter-Pluto conjunction , that occur in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some of the previous pandemics , were in exact conjunction on April 5 , 2020 .\nThese two planets will be conjoint two times this year ; one on June 30 and the other on November 13 .\nAs a result , although we will experience a decline in the severity of the outbreak in the summer months , we may expect a second wave of outbreak in fall , especially in November !\n[ 15 ] Eclipses in Gemini and Sagittarius are associated with respiration , communication , circulation and journeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the end of 2021 .\nAdditionally , we will have an eclipse on Cancer 0\u00b0 on June 21 which will bring important developments about the whole world .\nIf we look back to the solar eclipse which occurred in 2001 on the same sign and same degree , we can see that the Twin Towers were attacked on September of that year .\nAccording to the ancient astrologers , the sign of our Earth is Cancer and the eclipses on 0 degree of Cancer/Capricorn axis are the signals of events and developments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis eclipse will remind us that WE ARE A BIG FAMILY .\nIn Traditional Astrology , the conjunctions of these planets , especially the sign where the conjunction takes place is extremely important .\nAccording to Sadullah al-Ankarawi , a 19th century Ottoman astrologer , plague and deaths increase all over the world during Saturn transits in Aquarius .\nMars-Saturn conjunction in Aquarius brings plague and other epidemics .\nWe had Mars-Saturn conjunction in Aquarius on April 1 , 2020 .\nThe health authorities have been telling that we were in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days of that conjunction .\nOn April 5 2022 , we will have another Mars-Saturn conjunction in Aquarius .\nSo , we will still be under the test of epidemics as stated in ancient texts .\nSaturn will be transiting in Aquarius until March 7 , 2023 .\nThe main actors of the recent pandemics , especially the latest outbreak of Covid-19 which started as of the end of 2019 , seem to be the decrease in solar activities , weakening of the magnetic field and Venus-Sun inferior conjunction which we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 21 , 2020 is also related to changes in the magnetic field and sunspot cycles .\nAs it will be the first conjunction of these two planets in Air signs , it is called the Great Mutation .\nJupiter-Saturn conjunctions have a great importance in astrology .\n\u2022 In the months following the inferior conjunction of Venus , the outbreak of virus may make an attack .\nNovember and December of 2020 are remarkable in this context .\n\u2022 As the magnetic field is getting weaker and Solar Minimum is deepening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a risky period not only due to the outbreak of Covid-19 but also in terms of outbreaks of other viruses .\nExisting virus may also mutate .\n\u2022 Jupiter-Pluto conjunctions are linked with great outbreaks as I mentioned in my previous article .\nThe last conjunction of these two planets will occur in November this year .\nThen , the influences of this conjunction will be decreasing .\nJupiter-Pluton conjunctions indicate important developments in health sector and in other scientific fields .\n\u2022 Lunar Nodes and eclipses in Gemini/Sagittarius axis will come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2022 .\nYou may see the details in my previous article .\n\u2022 Ancient astrologers state Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions , the next one which will occur on December 21 , 2020 , are associated with plague and other epidemics .\nSaturn which is temporarily in Aquarius now , will return to Capricorn on July 2 and will then enter in Aquarius again on December 17 , 2020 .\nJupiter will also be in Aquarius on December 19 , 2020 .\nTogether with this transit , we may expect some big developments in medical field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 , 2021 , some huge developments will be experienced and important step for the future will be taken .\n\u2022 Saturn will stay in Aquarius until March 7 , 2023 .\nOn April 5 , 2022 , we will experience the second Mars-Saturn conjunction in Aquarius which indicates plague , fatal outbreaks and mass disasters .\nConsequently , it is obvious that Covid-19 will be on the scene in April and May this year .\nHowever , we should not relax in June .\nWe should follow the instructions and rules and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of deaths on earth may increase seriously .\nDevelopments about vaccine and medication are on the horizon .\nWe should be hopeful about the future , we should be in cooperation and we should fight together against this common enemy .\nIf we are careful about the precautions , then we may sigh with relief in summer months .\nHowever , we should be cautious about the possibility of another wave of outbreak in autumn .\nWe are in a period where we will realize what the ancients meant with the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important within this context .\nWe are at the edge of a huge change as the whole humanity .\nThrough the developments in science , technology , data processing and education , our lives will transform into a new form which is highly different than today .\n[ 5 ] The meteoritic hypothesis ; a statement of the results of a spectroscopic inquiry into the origin of cosmical systems

orbit of 8 years , creating a 5 pointed star in the zodiac , gives us an endless and regular reference point that is easily calculated once we know the movement of Venus her cycle and her Star !\nFor example as we move toward the Capricorn Star point \u2013 exact on January 9th , 12:47am UTC @ 18\u00b0 43\u2032 Capricorn , consider what was happening in your life around January 2014 ( and leading up to and after the exact retrograde star point ) and also in January 2018 when this point was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Sun .\nAs well as go back to 2010 , 2006 and so on , as the star points , repeat every 4 years in the same place of the zodiac , slowly moving backwards over time , and shifting from inner rx conjunctions to repeat as outer conjunctions 4 years later .\nIn my many years work , researching and teaching on the Venus Star , I have come to see each star point inner or outer as significant as the other .\nAstrologers tend to focus mostly on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , when she will return to the any phase and place in the zodiac , yet when working with the Star Points , their 4 year , pulse and Venusian clock , only happens at the exact Sat Point phase , inner or outer , revealing to us so much more when followed closely .\nThe Moon too does this !\nIf we look at any new Moon , we know 4 years later ( give or take a degree or 2 ) there will a full Moon in the opposite degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ) .\nThen 4 years later again another new moon occurs in the same degrees .\nAs the Venus point oscillates from inner and outer conjunctions every 9.5 months , from morning star to evening star in her orbit , as depicted in the image above , we can she she returns to the same place in the zodiac every 4 years , but from the opposite place .\nFrom the newness of the interior conjunction to the fulness of the outer conjunction , we get the never ending experience and view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that star point .\nLike the Moon , Venus waxes and wanes , grows in light , ascend and descends and disappears into the light of the Sun , not only once like the Moon , yet twice during her inner and outer conjunctions .\nSince Galileo \u2019 s discoveries through his telescopes we know that Venus has phases , and these days for many practising astrologers looking at and knowing our Venus phase has become quite significant .\nLike knowing our Moon phase , we look at where in the 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were born , giving more detail and archetypal clarity to our particular Venus , not just by sign , house and aspect but now also by phase .\nThe Venus cycle is closely related to the The Fibonacci sequence and the Golden 1.6 ratio connecting our astrology charts to the fractal like nature of natural patterning and repetition , growth and evolution .\nFor a full explanation of Venus cycle please READ Here Take a good look at the Capricorn Star Point dates to help inform you of what was going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle !\nAs we get ready for the next loop , let \u2019 s take a look more closely at what this next loop brings , keeping in mind some personal research from above !\nAs Venus retrograde in Capricorn bridges 2021 \u2013 2022 \u2013 The Star Point , the Venus /Sun conjunction shows the midpoint of the retrograde , the end of the past 19 month cycle and the begining of the next one .\nMoving retrograde for 14\u00b0 degrees , over 40 days/40 night the retrograde passes are the times of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so to speak , bringing down her wisdom of the past cycle , letting go and shedding the unwanted past , with a renewed purpose and what will now begin her new journey .\nWith Venus retrograde and under the Sun \u2019 s beams , many astrologers point to the retrograde as \u201c Her Journey to the underworld \u201d yet it is the outer conjunction that points to the myth of descent to the unknown , and her furthest passage away from earth .\nIn the retrograde pass Venus will only disappears for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior conjunction , she disappears for 60-80 days and takes 7 months and 7 waning Moon gates to get there after her max elongation .\nThis is what the descent of Inanna and Venus is all about .\nThe 40 day 40 night retrograde , is a re-set , re-view , re-alignment , and a great preparation for the long journey ahead , the next 19 month great mission .\nI like to say to the Underworld or Upperworld , as either could apply !\nAt the superior conjunct phase , here Venus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission , deal with relationship issue , embrace the comings and goings of loved ones , confronting her inner self or her dark shadow self .\nThe Morning Star phase ( begins at retrograde inner conjunction ) and the descent , to underworld .\nThe Evening Star phase ( begins at outer conjunction ) and is the ascent out of the underworld .\nReflect on the past 19 month cycle as we get ready to birth the New Venus Star and the next 19 month cycle , that begins on January the 9th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after which the crescent of Venus rises as the morning star once again .\nFind this new Venus Star place , 19\u00b0 Capricorn , in your astrology chart , check what house it is in and what aspects it makes .\nReflect back in 4 year and 8 year cycles , back to Jan 2018 and Jan 2014 , 2010 , 2006 etc to gather the intell on what this star point is about for you , now upgrading to the next phase of your Venusian evolution !\nUse the image above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming cycle : There has been some debate in our community over the years as to where the cycle of Venus actually begins .\nThe sky watcher shamanic astrologers would say that the cycle begins with the heliacal rising of Venus as she rises as the morning star in the east .\nTraditionalist astrologers would say , that the cycle begins with Venus rising as an evening star in the west .\nThe reasoning for the latter is that Venus at this part of her cycle is low in the sky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains in light , as she also appears like the Moon does when new , in the western evening sky !\nThere a a few things to consider here , with both of the above viewpoints .\nThe shamanic way , is a delight to follow , which I definitely encourage , yet it is much more difficult to co-ordinate , as the rise can happen at slightly different times and days , depending on place , atmosphere and latitudes and is not so simply found by an ephemeris , yet some software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shamanic viewpoint and the visual sky gaining importance in our astrology circles this is indeed a practice that I see as important to be followed and even encouraged as it teaches us so much more about the living sky .\nFrom the ancient Babylonians to the Mayans and thru many other ancient cultures we know that the heliacal rise ( rising out of the Sun \u2019 s beams ) of the planets and stars as always being most significant .\nYet it is much easier and direct to work out phases and co-ordinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOne thing that makes no sense to me with the more traditional method , and also perhaps as they were devised before the discovery of Venus \u2019 phases by Galileo , is that to consider Venus as an evening star , rising in the west as the begining of her cycle like a fresh new Moon does , simply makes no sense .\nThe Moon orbits the Earth and Venus orbits the Sun .\nTheir meeting point with the Earth , for the Moon is a New Moon , and is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venus \u2019 newness , as she transits between Earth and Sun , not when she rises out of the outer conjunction , but when she moves off to the east , rising before the Sun to become the morning star !\nWith the retrograde of Venus in Capricorn and as the Venus Star point perfects and Venus comes to light again as morning star , we are set off on a new Capricorn themed cycle .\nA cycle that begins with reconnecting and re-evaluating Capricorn themes in our lives , shown by what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point have made .\nCAPRICORN represents our achievements , ambitions , acknowledgments , responsibilities , how we live by the laws of society , how we value ourselves in society , how we are rewarded , what our families expect of us and how we conform in Saturn \u2019 s ruled sign , for our own good or detriment !\nWe have all recently , and gathering before this exact star point , been greatly affected as our rights as citizens have changed so much during the pandemic , the need for vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly updated and chaotic rules and regulations , as living in society in this new Aquarian Age shows it true controlling colours !\nWe have all been affected differently and have made choices accordingly , by what we value most and chose to stand by !\nCapricorn themes also bring those in leadership , our governing bodies and corporations and our rulings systems into the spotlight !\nWe \u2019 ve witnessed their increasing power and hold over us , we \u2019 ve witnessed their triumphs and foibles and lack of transparency , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight a pandemic .\nWith this star point , Venus calls in a reshuffle in the system with a response for a shift in leadership around the globe , watch this space over coming months as the consequences of recent events come to light in 2022 , as the Capricorn star stays active , like eclipse energies for months after and months before exactness .\nThe Capricorn Star Point also points to the elite and privileged , and those that society looks up too or puts in the spotlight .\nWe can expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reshuffle of leadership in the months to come .\nAs the Venus retrograde began conjunct Pluto , Ghisliane Maxwell , former socialite went to trail and was convicted for her part in Epstein \u2019 s child sex trafficking , implicating also royal Prince Andrew .\nGhisliane \u2019 s astrology chart shows the Capricorn star point in her 8th house , and Pluto transiting her Saturn , where the current Venus retrograde began .\nFor Prince Andrew , the Capricorn star point squares his MC/IC from the 6th house , and quincunx natal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transits his Pisces Sun and the 8th house and Saturn his Descendant .\nNovak Djokovic another celebrity in the spotlight at this time , being denied a visa to enter Australia for his much loved Australian Open tournament which he has won 9 times .\nHe is unvaccinated and has no medical exemption , which are the requirements to enter the tournament .\nThe Venus Star Point joins his ASC , and it is still not clear if he will have to leave the country yet , raising a great controversy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government \u2019 s rules and regulations on vaccine mandates .\nLatest news now is ( Jan 14th , 2022 ) his visa has been cancelled and he will have to leave the country .\nSet yourself for the next 19 month journey ahead , by first RE-evaluating , re-assigning , re-working , re-valuing , re-doing , re-sourcing and re-adjusting life updating to your current values !\nDig deep , and allow for what will rise strike during this , saying no , saying yes , are all turning points on the journey ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new Libra Star Point , which is the Scorpio star point of the past 100 years moves to Libra , for the first time in our lives , and is sure to bring in a new energy into that area of our charts and lives and on a mundane level could be quite dynamic- watch this space .\nAssess what maybe brewing for you in this area of the chart , and 20\u00b0 Leo in August 2023 as the cycle completes .\nAdapt the same analysis as you do with this Capricorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans .\nNext Star point LIBRA Oct 25th , 2022 is Venus ruled and occurs as Mars stations retrograde in Gemini at 26\u00b0 in trine to the new star point !\nLet Venus be you guide to connect the unseen dots in your astrology chart !",

Space between the waves", "content": "But it is from sound that we are born ; it is sound that accompanies our transition between differing states of consciousness ; and it is from sound that the knowledge of the cosmos is revealed , encoded within the symbol of the Water Bearer , Aquarius or the consciousness filter called Fixed Air .\nYou would be forgiven if you find strange the term stillness being linked with Air , after all movement feels to be its \u2019 natural state , especially in coastal temperate regions of the world .\nEssential to life in the form of breath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist and can rip up the Earth .\nBut it can also bring fire to life by providing the necessary fuel to feed the flame ; it can push a boat across water and shape the land through erosion .\nIts very existence is fundamental to wellness , let alone it being the alpha and omega to our bodies as we in and excarnate .\nThis month lunation rekindles our personal relationship with the element of Air , as the lights of the waters above synchronise for but a brief moment , whispering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to the breath and sound of the Cosmos , the Nada .\nTwo oscillating wavelengths , parallel to each other , the Nada or invisible vibration that permeates all of Creation , mirrored in the material world ; and the vibration of the physical plane , mirroring the vibration of the cosmic rhythm .\nMovement , not stillness , yet again immediately springs to mind when you initially look at the symbol , as your eye naturally descends and ascends along the waves , in the same way that your body sways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of music ; the mind immediately remembering forgotten memories as the first bar of a song is heard ; the heart is stirred ; the soul , uplifted ; the spirit , animated .\nJust as life can not flourish without stillness , both music and the waves of Aquarius are nothing without the pause , or space between .\nMany struggle to cope with the Twins \u2013 Pause and Stillness \u2013 in a world consumed with activity and movement .\nSociety tells you that you must have something wrong with you ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that you are lazy if you take time out to simply be .\nPauses , or space , are inherent .\nNature stills within the shorter days ; ladies are to retreat at the Dark Moon ; the spaces between notes , in musical composition , are as important as the melody itself .\nImagine listening to someone giving a continuous single sentence speech , or reading Joyce \u2019 s Ulysses !\n!\nNot only is it exhausting to keep concentrating on the constant stream of words issuing forth from a speakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will eventually become lost within this unending , monotonous stream of sound from which you will eventually crave relief from .\nThe \u2018 rest \u2019 in music allows the listener to absorb each musical phrase before the next one starts .\nImbued with both reflection and anticipation , the space encapsulates the concept of being present , just as the rest within a musical phrase adds strength to the rhythm of the melody .\nIf the musician were only to produce charming cadences for the sake of making beautiful sound and she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her imaginative energies would quickly exhaust and her voice would fade .\nWhilst the actual creation of the music itself ( cardinal ) and the intrinsic interchange between the musician and the listener ( mutable ) make up an obvious dualism , the procreative process gains its driving force from the alteration of sound and silence , vocalising and listening , creating and perceiving and ultimately from the individualistic meaning attributed to the harmonic vibrations as you internalise what the sound means to you ( Fixed ) .\nThe listener \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not hear the real message within the melody .\nIt is this silent listening , the ultimate experience of all pervading sweetness concealed in the vibration of sound , that turns the music into something meaningful , inspiring and rejuvenating .\nIt is within the stillness and silence that a deeper rhythm can be heard and a resonance that those on a spiritual path intimately understand carries a frequency that can raise our awareness .\n\u201c Nothing is inert , all vibrates .\nAll is vibration.\n\u201d Returning to the Aquarian symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as above , so below , you can see the parallel sine waves mirroring each other , one above , the other below \u2013 the Nada or invisible cosmic radiation or vibration and Bhur-Ioka or the physical plane we live within .\nBetween them is the space , an essentially invisible , or incorporeal , bridge that connects both together .\nThese wavelengths carry knowledge \u2013 the upper is accessed through the eye whose inwards focus falls upon the Akashi ; the lower is transposed through the ear and eyes and reasoned within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still space that the two are connected , and it is through the medium of sound that a shift in consciousness occurs .\nAnd the only way to truly \u2018 hear \u2019 the upper wavelength is through stillness , a process that can be supported by listening to music and eventually hearing your own music .\nMusic reminds us that we are always still .\nIt connects us to the Now .\nWe become at one with the moment and our notion of time and space , worry and tension dissolves as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe experience our stillness .\nWe can hear ourselves .\nWe can simply be .\nMusic brings us closer to our stillness as we lose ourselves in the moment , forgetting about the busyness of life and the constant stream of addictions that surround our material lives .\nMusic prompts us to listen ; to reflect ; to connect ; to remember ; and to be fully present in the now .\nThe Aquarian within you can learn from the stillness within music .\nThe musical pause , or reflection , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listener to truly hear the message within the harmonies .\nIt is within the still space that a deeper rhythm can be heard , a rhythm necessary to free yourself from the noise that keeps you embedded within the physical plane .\nIn the three days leading up to this Fixed Air , New Moon I would urge you to immerse yourself in the pauses within your music , allowing yourself to ride the wave , observing what voices rises from within your own Deep .", "author": "AGENT 12 - JULIJA SIMAS", "url":

Lights of your Consciousness on the 2 nd of March holds a little more weight than the average dawn , due to the presence of five other dawns .\nAs you are aware from my writing over the past decade , the four Beings that guide the emerging \u2018 form \u2019 of consciousness have three ways of exercising themselves within this plane of existence .\nThose twelve doorways open us to the deeper experience of Being and of becoming unified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we get to replenish our vital Lights with a renewal of each consciousness .\nThe realm of the sOul is up for renewal , as it does every four months .\nAs you approach the union of the lights , five other cycles are within their death throes \u2013 the passion of your heart ; the empowerment of love ; the cleansing of your vital energy ; the determination of your mind ; and the love for humanity .\nConfigured uniquely within your own constellations , culminatively the sheer frequency of ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are observing in the world , along with the deeply spiritual movement that naturally occurs when deep existential questioning arises in times of darkness .\nWhat it is being replaced with is not yet clear as you are between the worlds , dancing between broken and whole , with light and dark being weaved within you .\nYou can feel that things will not be the same but still do not know what is truly being asked of you .\nThis unknowing groundless ground is your home , a home where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you can step away from control and embrace the oceanic tide that constantly vacillates .\nWe live within a sea of myriad cycles of consciousness , each with their own phases of starts and ends .\nThose rhythms in your life are reflected in the ebb and flow of your cosmic consciousness , just as they are reflected in the life of the collective in the cyclical rhythms of the planetary orbits around the Sun and in consort with each other .\nWhen we move through a time when several cycles reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensity of contrasting emotions , frustration is joined with anticipation ; grief with relief ; and melancholy with hope .\nDeath is merely a way of facilitating growth and awareness .\nIt engenders humility and compassion and it opens your heart to a deeper sense of love , appreciation and growth .\nDeath is also not final .\nIt is merely a stage in an ongoing cyclical spiral of experience , a process that every woman knows intimately .\nHaving the opportunity to reflect on what you have learnt , what you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be let dwindle is a natural process ahead of any endings , because birth grows out of those darkening reflections .\nYou must be aware that you are being encouraged to pull away from the drama and focus on creating afresh from your own heart , as you will have felt , in January , a change of heart focus and a hunger to lead from your heart , as opposed to over rationalise everything from the multitude of information sources that you have access to .\nYou must feel it deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a threshold of a dawning reality ?\nThe awareness that beneath the ongoing lies and deception , is a heart of kindness , compassion and consideration , fragile , grieving and sad , but yet ever in a state of hope .\nGet your copy of C*I*A \u2019 s quarterly TIMELORDS magazine But the March renewal is about the living waters of your soul , which concerns the way in which you share and receive the heart of another , be that a person , a concept , a group or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is never lost even when your physical body is cut open .\nHeld within the matrix of form , it bathes and protects the living ethereal memory of your body , the DNA , and it is from this element that we architecture life , express experience with colour and tone , and open the pathway to immortality .\nWhen shared and exchanged with another , the fusion of ideals , the broadening of awareness and the heightening of experience , deepens our compassion , enables our compassion and humbles our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection .\nIntellectual exchange is not sufficient .\nIt is important to feel the presence of another .\nAnd in time of social distancing , of perpetuation of fear of contamination , of an external enemy , the mind can draw into itself , rendering the heart forlorn , isolated and stagnant .\nOne of the three forms of Water is called Mutable , or Pisces , and it refers to the exchange of emotionally charged light between all living and non-living things .\nWherever this sign falls within your birth chart shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose all sense of Self , let go all notions of ego and merge with someone or something , as you move beyond the illusion of the ego mind and return to the One-ness of Source Consciousness .\nAnd it is on the 2nd of March that the Sun and Moon align within this Living Water sign .\nWater is our life giver , nourishing and activating life , permeating all aspects of physical reality , binding and connecting us together , a lunation within this element has the simultaneous impact of raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of your life and within the Mutable mode , you have the possibility of raising the heart level in the lives of everyone else !\nSo as the Moon disappears from our night sky , a space opens up to view the celestial Source more clearly .\nThat our universe is a reflection of us and vice versa , when we gaze into the apparently fathomless beauty of the night sky , we are actually looking deep with our own numinosity .\nWith no light to distract us from our own interiority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel into our Deep .\nThe vibration created by the synergy of OUR cosmic in and out breaths coming together , creates a portal within our interiority to forge a new relationship to the re-kindled archetype .\nIt is dark for a little over two days prior to new moon ( as well as for about two days immediately after the new moon ) it is useful to take this time to contemplate and reflect on what you need to emotional share and receive in the year ahead .\nFor me , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest aspiration and as well as a challenge , especially when engaging with anyone beyond my immediate circle of care and protection .\nWe create from our heart and not mind , and the external world is merely a mirror of our internal state .\nTherefore , what you create from is what you receive , and that creation stems not from a mental awareness , but from a deep experiential knowingness .\nGhandi , I believe , once said , \u2018 be the change you wish to see in the world \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold dear to my own heart .\nLiving what you feel , as opposed to affirming it , is what the sOul of Pisces teaches us .\nPisces is Living Emotion , emotion that is freely exchanged and shared with the world .\nLove continues to ask you to feel more and to bare witness to the true potential of your life .\nIf it helps , remember that love is what you are born with whereas fear is what you have learned .\nAs you encounter the power of your heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up your heart-centre more tangibly , the unlearning of fear and prejudice and the acceptance of Love in your heart is central to the spiritual dimension of this planetary coupling .\nSo take the opportunity to remember love whenever it presents itself .\nAs you stare into the rising sun on the morn of this Piscean lunation , allow its \u201c rays \u201d burn into your heart .\nDon \u2019 t look away and breathe in the beautiful pink and orange colour adorning the sky .\nOpen yourself and let love penetrate you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the time to read or listen to these lunation thoughts and I wish you all the best with the plethora of new beginnings unique to this lunation , along with continued lOve during this time wherein some are hell bent on egoic greed , vanity , material accumulation and perpetuation fear , strike and division .\nThis is a profound time in our collective spiritual evolution and it is a time to heart-centred compassion and kindness .", "author": "AGENT EI - ANDREW SMITH", "url": "https://cosmicintelligenceagency.com/the-new-moon-pisces-2022/", "published": "Mon, 28 Feb 2022 07:30:09

at 27\u02da .\nI call the Virgo Full Moon , the practical mystic Full Moon as it makes and opposition between the pragmatic Virgo Moon and the arcane and transcendental energy of the Sun in Pisces .\nIf I had to sum up this Full Moon in a few words , however , I would call it the purifying and purging Full Moon and this lunation is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and detritus that really needs to be cleansed from our lives , both individually and collectively .\nThe Virgo/Pisces axis is the most sensitive axis and one that is all about service , compassion , and kindness ; and acting in the world through that lens .\nOn this lunation , with the Sun , our core and center of our Solar system , in the spiritual sign of Pisces and the Moon , our emotions , in self-improvement oriented Virgo , we are called to cleanse and purify ego driven actions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collective service , connecting heaven and Earth .\nThe cleansing energy is amplified by the Pisces Sun \u2019 s proximity to nebulous Neptune as this lunation takes place days after an ecstasy inducing cazimi ( conjunction ) between the Sun and Neptune , when nebulous Neptune sat on the Royal throne .\nA lot of fear , shadow material , and feelings of menace , deception , trickery and long held heavy emotions may surface also .\nThis could be said to be , in reality , a Pisces lunation , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both rulers of the sign , Jupiter and Neptune , who are both combust the Sun , which means the light of the Sun is burning their energy with her heat .\nThis is exhausting and disorienting and , with the heightened energy of the Full Moon , a lot of rest and self care will be needed .\nTime spent in nature , around water , taking salt baths , and naps , will be helpful .\nAll forms of retreat to give yourself some space will aide you in working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about faith and belief and we are called to surrender and release any Virgo tendencies of control , analysis paralysis , and fault finding and trust that the universe has our back .\nAs I mentioned , this is the sixth and final Full Moon at 27\u02da .\n27 is the number of the bodhisattva , the enlightened being who helps others to enlightenment .\nCombining the divine feminine 2 with the 7 of intuition and wisdom to create the 9 , the completion of a cycle and beginning of the new .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yin , and healing potential in this lunation .\nWe are each called to embody our bodhisattva nature , to be of spiritual service to the interconnectedness of all on Earth .\nThat this number is has repeated 6 times and the final Full Moon at this number is in a 6 year brings the 6 that also represents connecting the above and below , and loving service to the world .\nThere is a sense of destiny contained within the aspects to this lunation , as the Full Moon creates a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dwarf planet of our collective soul destiny , Sedna in Taurus .\nBoth Pluto and Sedna purge , cleanse , and destroy that which does not aide us in moving towards our higher destiny .\nThe water and earth elements of this powerful , purging kite configuration wash away unneeded Earthly attachments , whether that be to material things , people , or anything that no longer brings value to your life , like a mud slide and push us towards the merging energy of oneness contained within the powerful energy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tune into the feelings of interconnectedness and may receive big downloads from source that bring a bigger sense of purpose in our lives .\nBe aware , however , that not all may be as it appears do to the nebulous nature of this Pisces energy and you may have to sit for a while to sift through dreams , synchronicities , and other messages you receive .", "author": "AGENT 555 - LOUISE EDINGTON",

"cosmicintelligenceagency", "title": "The Jupiter Neptune conjunction, elections and emotion.", "content": "Increasingly noticeable , the major astrological event of 2022 , the Jupiter-Neptune conjunction in Pisces will be highly active from the last week of February to the end of May .\nIt will become active again from the end of October to the end of December .\nThe two planets will conjunct each other exactly on April the 12th , as political shifts and elections take place around this cosmic alignment .\nThe first round of the French presidential election , scheduled for the 10th , March the 9th in South Korea , and May the 9th in the Philippines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia .\nThen , at the end of the year when the conjunction returns , the USA will hold its midterm elections ( 1 ) .\nWithout attempting to make predictions \u2013 or take sides \u2013 let us ask ourselves if the encounter of these two planets has the capacity to influence the ballots and , more generally , how does it affect our destinies ?\nThe main fact to remember is the excessive importance of emotion and its undue influence on the debates , opinions and behaviors ; the winner is unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discernment .\nIt is certainly never quite the case ; we are not composed of cold intellects in which only rationality and logic govern our choices and decisions .\nEmotion makes us human , as the two masters of Pisces , the most sensitive of the zodiac signs , remind us .\nWhat would we be without the ability to be moved , and without feeling a sense of justice and compassion ?\n( Jupiter ) or deprived of the urge to empathy and communion ( Neptune ) ?\nUnfortunately , overflowing emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u201c \u2026 .\nthe distinction to be made between love , which is self-sufficient , and sentimentality characterized by fear and suffering is crucial .\nSentimentality is the source of the unspeakable , especially if one \u201d genuinely \u201d believes to be acting for the Good .\nIndignation can be a superficial reaction to injustice , a way of defining oneself , of feeling virtuous and compassionate , and of filling the inner void \u201d ( 2 ) .\nThis is the very danger : amplified by Jupiter , sentimentality ( Neptune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and indignation ( Jupiter ) , accounts for many opinions .\nFear , anger , grief at times , and perhaps contempt overrule reason .\nJoy and confidence are not absent , but they move in a tight circle : people rejoice and become enthusiastic amid large partisan rallies where they loudly testify to their faith in a certain ideology and in the anticipated victory of their favorite candidate .\nIn this context , naive beliefs , illusions and manipulations thrive ; let us remember that in a natal chart , apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be underestimated , a Jupiter-Neptune conjunction associates with emotional dazzlement ( Neptune ) and poorly offered trust ( Jupiter ) .\nOne will be more easily seduced by denunciations of injustice ( Jupiter ) , and promises to protect the vulnerable ( Neptune ) , than by well-considered and reasoned arguments .\nCasting a vote for a person or for an image ?\nOur present-day elections involve millions of people who choose not a person in the flesh , but the perceived image of that person .\nNeptune , who among other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the mastermind of these images which are crafted over time through articles , profiles and interviews ; this provokes subtle shifts of feelings in the public mind .\nA simple alteration of a properly staged image triggers a sudden sort of empathy ( Neptune ) towards a political figure who then seems more touching , more human , more intimate ; whereas a mistake , a misplaced comment , provokes a rejection , a disgrace from which it is sometimes very difficult to recover .\nOnce again , in the context which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each playing its own tune : if the image itself , inevitably delusional , is Neptunian , its content \u2013 generally righteousness , integrity , unselfishness , and truth \u2013 is Jupiterian .\nThe contenders are therefore altruistic ( Jupiterian ) with a mission to achieve , not in the least motivated by power , money or fame .\nIf these are standard mechanisms in most elections , the Jupiter-Neptune conjunction greatly magnifies them .\nThe pre-election climate is permeated by it : people argue more about the personal character of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Either they are seen as saviors or violently rejected .\nThis confusion leads to brutal reactions and instinctive dismissals in a highly polarized society .\nThis polarization arises from identification , a dangerous neptunian tendency ( 3 ) now amplified by Jupiter : even more than usual , we are influenced by the sense of belonging ( Neptune ) to one or several categories defined by social class , religious beliefs or lack thereof , ethnic origin , cultural background and even , actuality compels , a pro or antivax attitude .\nNeptune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fusion and communion , is thus found at the root of our worst behaviors : Neptunian identification feeds racism , xenophobia , intolerance , hatred and ultimately violence , brutality and war .\nWrongly instrumentalized , legitimate anger against injustice ( Jupiter ) fuels this logic of identification ( Neptune ) which looks for the guilty on the outside ; it then becomes imperative to belong to a group ( Neptune ) which possesses the truth ( Jupiter ) , thereby defining oneself against the others .\nNeptune is very much associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and secret manipulations , whether national or foreign .\nJupiter on the other hand has a lot to do with frankness and truth .\nThis mixture generates a great deal of confusion , truth and lies intermingling in a world where disinformation has become an organized and sometimes even a lucrative activity .\nOver the next few months , Jupiter is expected to amplify neptunian activities through hacking , troll factories , media manipulation and social networks .\nThese activities are to be watched closely in the context of the current Ukrainian crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role : Vladimir Putin is a former spy ( Neptune ) and Russia , although traditionally Aquarius , has much to do with the sign of Pisces .\nThe situation could very well remain confused and chaotic until the end of May More than ever , information and their sources must be assessed , because truths ( Jupiter ) and lies ( Neptune ) are more than entangled .\nThroughout the world this planetary context fuels the possibility of scandals , which may affect opinions and results in the countries where elections are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jupiter encourages \u2013 through recklessness or excessive extraversion \u2013 the exposure of improperly shared secrets , again in the context of poorly placed trust .\nThe Jupiter-Neptune conjunction powerfully influences the collective consciousness for better or for worse .\nEmotion is a tremendously powerful energy that needs to be felt in all its purity , i.e.\n, free from the shackles of conditioning , beliefs and manipulations : \u201d Ideally Jupiter and Neptune are associated with the genuine , fiery emotion , not conditioned by the fear of suffering , freed from lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balloon of the ego is then deflated and the inner emptiness that one has fled through identifications and illusions , turns out to be the greatest wealth one can possess \u201d ( 4 ) .\nAs we approach significant elections while the world continues its mad trajectory towards self-destruction , let us remember that Jupiter truly represents justice and compassion for the weakest ( Neptune ) .\nTherefore , it is not excluded that these next months justice and philosophy ( Jupiter ) as well as empathy and the wish for communion ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slowing down at least a bit the race towards personal interests which destroys our societies and our planet .\nOur choices , electoral or otherwise , could consequently be more grounded in generosity , altruism and heartfelt intelligence .\nUltimately , this means looking inward , no longer blaming the other , in order to understand the great neptunian principle : I am the world , and the world is me ; an awareness allowing Jupiter to unfold its principles of justice and compassion throughout the collective consciousness .\nTo reach this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uranian intelligence are called upon , since celestial geometry is a whole , but this is another story to be told .\n( 1 ) Brazil holds presidential elections in October the 2nd , with Jupiter retrograde in

yet , something tells you that this is no longer the way .\nIt may never have been the path , even if there are those within this world whose better interests are served by encouraging the externalising of loci upon things that you can control .\nThis has been going on for millennia and appears to be a theme of the Dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are moving out from within .\nAstrologers have been aware of this for such a long time as the message of the presence of the planetary Beings has been reduced to not only irrelevant material spheroids but the encouragement of causality has given

light that will eventually draw you through and out .\nYou know that this light connects you to a vast awareness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if it is a light that can not be seen through the lens of two

weary of the encouragement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mantra that you can not make a sustainable living from what you lOve .\nSomewhere deep within you know that you can and that fuels your imagination , vividly colouring your world , exciting your sOul and kindling the fire at the root of your spine .\nThe wheel perpetually turns , spinning round and round like a record on a turntable , ever playing

embodiment of that Light , the more the world around you morphs to mirror that which you are .\nThe truer you are to your truth , the stronger the belief you have to be you and to live in accord with your vision and Light .\nAnd it is possible .\nJust look at any young child in your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how they live without any awareness of creed , skin tone , gender or ethnicity ; how they simply are ; how they do not understand why the impossible is not possible .\nAnd why not ?\nIf there exists those who are using the cosmological rhythms to sync their dream , drawing the world into that vision , then it is possible for you to do the same .\nThe profound alignment of the 12th of April offers a portal to unite the soul of humanity , just as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1st of April offers you an opportunity to true feel the unity of Vision .\nSo my prayer for you and for humanity , is that we turn from the distraction of the illusory light , to the Singular Light accessed by the Eye that can see , so that an empowered Vision fills your heart , fires up the snake and energised your being with a singular passion to create from .\nBlessings to you and those who will directly benefit

all that lives and all that exists , renews with vigour and hope every 13 years .\nTheir ethereal embrace heralds an uplifting shift in consciousness , as a gateway opens to whose sOul seeks nothing but to merge with this Divine cadence .\nTheir quiet and subtle dance spirals through life , whispering quietly to those with open ears , knowledge that serves to liberate beyond the education of the mundane sphere .\nEver seeking to lift the eye towards the shimmering inky waters above ; gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that which binds and anchors it ; this all-encompassing pulse forms the backdrop through which hope pervades humanity , beckoning it to become more than it is , opening up vision to inspire and uplift , and to encourage consciousness to proliferate with experience and insight .\nThat grandiose Being , Jupiter , is a reminder of unhampered proliferation of creative expression .\nThrough his doorway , you are drawn up and out , far beyond the experience of your everyday experience , as you move through his expansive and fertile landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beings within you , are opened up , broadened and amplified , adding zest , confidence and a touch of \u2018 creative license \u2019 to those scripts and patterns that involve his expansive soul .\nIt is through Neptune that you touch the liminal and deeply willowy angelic realm , a realm that retains a somewhat human-esque form , but is that place that leads to the architectural realm of sacred geometry , a go-between place buffering the deeper light and the astral realms .\nNeptune \u2019 s boundlessness diffuses and enchants any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to re-imagine the perimeters .\nTogether , consciousness is opened and uplifted ; creative chaos abounds ; vision becomes unlimited and unfettered ; the offering , suggestive and unclear ; the longing , enchanting and grandiose ; and the ideals , grandiose and utopic , if not a tad surreal and embellished .\nThey are hope personified , as the hunger for communal equality mesmerises and enchants even the most materialistic atheist to be more than they are and to be better than they are .\nEsoterically , their presence reflects the capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being , with Jupiter reflecting a gateway through which awareness grows within our physical sense-being , whereas Neptune is that path along which our \u2018 light-body \u2019 is permeated with the intelligence from the waters from Creation and sOurce .\nQuintessentially Yin , their 13 year cycle has historically shown itself as being euphoric , feverish and hungry to find deeper meaning within the strife and greed of the material world .\nThe urge to truly liberate the sOul from the confines of the physical world , coupled with the impetus to search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amongst the other manifestations I have observed both at an individual and collective level .\nAnd it is within the collective that this cycle appears to orientate itself to , as the urge to free society from the tutelage of doctrine and to seek solace in the universal , in unity consciousness and in bliss seems to be central to the beat of their heart .\nTheir midpoint , an equidistant invisible merging of the auric fields of the planets , seems to point to the awareness of a deeper music that penetrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out beyond the confines of the extant parameters of creativity and imagination .\nThe sign of the zodiac in which they union reflects the consciousness of the Spirit that pervades quietly in the background over the duration that Neptune remains in one sign , Jupiter \u2019 s annual Ingress into each subsequent sign accounting for the differing phases of the Neptune transit , compounding the synodic sign twice , before refreshing in a following sign .\nFor those familiar with the \u2018 houses \u2019 of a horoscope , the activities denoted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged \u2019 to transcend beyond their normal manifestations , and it is where gOd is sought over the course of the duration of the cycle .\nNEXT issue Due out May 5th \u2013 Get your copy of C*I*A \u2019 s quarterly TIMELORDS magazine NOV 201 and Feb 2022 HERE History is terribly distorted , biasedly persevered by the victors of the perpetual egoic conflicts that pervade humanity \u2019 Fall .\nJupiter and Neptune \u2019 s cycle is less about events but more about culture \u2019 s atmosphere , society \u2019 s longings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more inclusive , compassionate and caring reality .\nJupiter \u2019 s perchance to amplify , extend and exaggerate , along with Neptune \u2019 s deftness at opening up and over-stimulating , means that together , regardless of sign , they cycle coincides with periods of inflation ( literally ) as the extant conditions are amplified before their illusory qualities drop away , leaving humanity in a search for meaning and subsequently a search for their sOul .\nThis process happens at all levels of society and it is within the material levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emanations seem to take place .\nThis also means that over-production and an un-controlled proliferation of goods and services , intellectually , socially and economically , can arise , and depending on the prevailing conditions the fall from grace can be extraordinary , as can be seen with the Aquarian 2009 , Capricorn 1997 , and Capricorn 1984 alignments ( the sub-prime market issues , the dot.com euphoria and Yuppie illusionary wealth ) .\nAt its worst , this synod can be seen as the Great Lie ; the ever moving goal-line ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bursting of the bubble ; the out-of-control propaganda ; and the seduction of false idols .\nIdeologically \u2018 socialist \u2019 in the purest sense of the term , you can see from the most recent time frames that the search for deeper meaning arises as a result of the over-stimulation , \u2018 exploration \u2019 and subsequent disappointment of/ with the material world .\nThe short lasting gratification of the fruits of the commercial activity and of money , means that the seeker is left bereft of meaning and true satisfaction , and feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since markets have become a barometer of collective emotional sentiment , this synod has become a gauge for hyper-inflation and the subsequent march of the lemmings off a cliff , as markets take a nose dive .\nWhy ?\nWhy do apparently \u2018 bad \u2019 things take place during these cycles .\nUltimately there is no such thing as good and bad , as many a positive and construct attribute has emerged from what appears to be a crisis of consciousness .\nBut the fall that can take place during this specific cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look beyond the material realm for deeper answers , so that it can be liberated from the enslavement of things that keep it bound to the physical plane .\nIt is not that this plane is a bad place to be in , even if many appear lost and distracted by the promise of a more materially advantageous future .\nIt is just that we are to retain being human but not being seduced by being human \u2013 to be in this world , but not of it , to paraphrase the spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the existential questioning that arises at the \u2018 beginning \u2019 starts to permeate the decision making process , as laws are established to \u2018 ensure \u2019 that society is protected from wantonness and greed .\nYet inevitably greed takes hold and by the waning stage of the cycle , things are spiralling into the dizzy heights of ignorance and therefore towards the self-similar ending .\nIs it possible for us to learn from our past .\nYes .\nWill we .\nThat truly depends on the socio-religious beliefs that the community holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individuals and since the external world is dependent upon the internal world , it is indeed possible to alter the ebb and flow of this unfoldment , raising up the level of consciousness at each subsequent renewal stages .\nStepping back through the Sign Remaining in a sign for over a millennia , the union degree retrogrades through each sign by 6 degrees every 166 years .\nThe alignment in Pisces last took place at 18 degree in 1856 ; at 12 Pisces in 1690 ; and at 6 Pisces in 1524 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the second since Neptune \u2019 s discovery in 1846 , which essentially means that humanity is yet to truly become familiar with the deeper meaning of this alignment in the Mutable Water filter .\nI am not a student of history , per ce , but I do find it interesting to note that the 1856 alignment took place during the early stages of the Spiritualist Movement in Europe , as many were in deep reaction to the thoroughly materialist and reductionist movement within science and industry .\nThe previous Piscean coupling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Enlightenment , as society was seeking to find a new gOd whereas the 1524 alignment occurred immediately after the last Redistribution of Power which led to the Creation of New Conditions of Being when Martin Luther \u2019 s protest laid the foundations for the economic and social reality we have come accustomed to , as many were jaded with the Catholic Church \u2019 s financial corruption and wanted to establish a more ideal society free from their shackles .\nAligning every 13 years and the pinnacle of Neptune \u2019 s passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way of interpreting the inherent meaning of any repetitious pattern , since number is merely a psychic structure that gives form to geometry ( number in space ) and music ( number in time ) , the two building blocks of third dimensional reality .\nA prime number indivisible by any other number , the \u2018 13 \u2019 has been demonised by those seeking power , order and control because of the gnostic revelatory qualities that infuse spirituality within our material world , as depicted by the Christ being the 13th of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Divine Heart on Earth ( Venus \u2019 13 orbits to Earth \u2019 s 8 ) ; the Moons 13 New \u2019 s within a Solar Year ; or the number of notes necessary to reach a higher consciousness ( 13 notes in an Equal Temperament Scale in Western chromatic music ) .\nFriday , Venus \u2019 day , the 13th , has been particular subject to much hysteria as being unlucky , and again pays homage to the suppression of circular feminine wisdom by the pyramidal patriarchy .\n13 is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore of love and unity , as understood by scholars of the gematria .\nIt is depicted in the Tarot as Death , whose presence reminds us of the disappearance from the physical plane of living beings , as they are liberated from their sleeves back into their true Self .\nDeath and her sisters , forgetting and sleep are portals , at differing levels of consciousness , of the act of disappearance , a quality deeply associated with the feminine and central to the Jupiter-Neptune cycle .\nAs images and representations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die \u2019 within the realm of the senses , and this is called \u2018 forgetting \u2019 .\nAs this \u2018 forgetting \u2019 extends each night into the totality of our memory , you \u2018 forget \u2019 yourself entirely , in a process known as sleep .\nSleep , therefore , is the younger sister of death , just as forgetting is the sister of sleep .\nAll three manifestations , albeit in differing in degrees , affect the disappearance of intellectual , psychic and physical phenomena , enabling the totality of the being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a state of Oneness and therefore Divine Grace .\nForgetting is to sleep as sleep is to death .\nOr again , forgetting is to memory as sleep as to consciousness , and sleep is to consciousness as death is to life .\nThe death that arises with the Jupiter-Neptune conjunction is not that of a physical death , but one that dissolves the illusion that this world is physical , and it opens you up to knowing the non-dual reality that penetrates the deeper dimensions of conscious awareness , challenging you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flooding your awareness with images that arise from this field of Unity consciousness .\nThe Presence of the Christ Light reminds us that beyond the 12 principles of living is a state of Grace that opens us to the notion of the resurrection , and the liberation of spirit from matter .\nIt is through the 13 that multiplicity becomes one , and therefore Jupiter-Neptune cycles open up the possibility the truth has to be liberated from within the subterfuge of egoic separation and desire , hence why the Shadow of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lies and Deceptions , which are merely constructs of greed , fear and power .\nThe hunger to liberate and to seek a more ideal and perfect world , a place wherein people lived freely and in union with something that gave deeper meaning , is a facet of the his combination , yet it is strongly filtered through the zodiacal sign in which it falls .\nThe signs of the zodiac , though initially a northern hemispheric mytho-poetic take on the seasons , is not based on the constellations , but on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the combination of the four perceptions of consciousness \u2013 vision or light ( Fire ) , sound or mind ( Air ) , heart or imagination ( Water ) and body or sensation ( Earth ) \u2013 with the three ways in which energy emerges through consciousness \u2013 Outwardly ( Cardinal ) , Inwards ( Fixed ) and Shared ( Mutable ) .\nThese twelve states reflect the stage of organic development that comprise our earthly incarnation , and they act as \u2018 colour \u2019 filters directing the bearer to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore the sign that any synod takes place within lends a colour tone to the way in which the union unfolds over the duration of the cycle .\nThe sign of Pisces is comprised of the modality of mutability and the element of water and it is within this moveable imaginal filter that we discover the Living Waters \u2013 both within and without , and above and below .\nSee , if you will , a picture of the ocean in your mind \u2019 s eye .\nThe ocean is \u2018 water in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small section of the ocean .\nNotice that the water is constantly rippling , creating waves .\nNow isolate and label that part of the water as a wave .\nYou would be forgiven is you are left with the impression that the wave is a separate entity to the ocean .\nBut a wave is not in the ocean .\nA wave is the ocean .\nSimilarly it is common to believe that you reside within a field of consciousness .\nBut what if you are the ocean ?\nWhat if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human being ?\nAfter all you are merely energy and within your cells resides memories , thoughts , feelings and experiences are held within the infinitesimal , undifferentiated pure energy source .\nBut it is the human level of experience and our addiction to it occludes the reality that you are one thread inexorably bound and connected to all other threads within the matrix of life .\nWithin each person living within this dimension of space and time a sense of oneness is infused in your very being as we are all made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange that energy when you breathe in and exhale out .\nTherefore whatever you create within your web , you create for everyone else .\nYour heart , your thoughts , your inspiration and your actions create reality for each and every-one of us .\nThe Jupiter-Neptune alignment in Pisces in 2022 The alignment of Jupiter and Neptune within Pisces reflects a deeper renewal of the living waters of your soul , which concerns the way in which you share and receive the heart of another , be that a person , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPrecious and vital to being , your waters are held within the matrix of form , bathing and protecting the living ethereal memory of your body , the DNA .\nIt is from this element that we architecture life , express experience with colour and tone , and open the pathway to immortality .\nWhen shared and exchanged with another , the fusion of ideals , the broadening of awareness and the heightening of experience , deepens our compassion , enables our compassion and humbles our sOul .\nConnection is vital .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper meaning , that lifts up the sOul , that bathes it in the purified waters of consciousness , energising you with awareness and empathy .\nThis synod carries the potential to envision a new seed of creative , imaginal soul life ; a seed that dwells within the waters of your soul ; a seed that has to be shared with another ; a seed that seeks to germinate with another and to exchange with another a vision for a new Earth .\nWe can \u2018 feel \u2019 that impetus within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more emotional and spiritual meaning , off the back of an almost detached and obsessive focus on the material realm .\nThe feeling that something was \u2018 missing \u2019 or that life had become devoid of colour , is something reflected in the cultural trends that emerged around those times , as illustrated in the literature , the fashion and the music not only of that time epoch ( the 13 years after the synod ) , but also in the lives of those born with the alignment .\nThe hunger to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore ironically adding to the continuation of anxiety and not encouraging you to live in the present , is something that appears as a strong virtue and value during Jupiter-Neptune times .\nBut how can you do that if you don \u2019 t have hope or vision for yourself ?\nAfter all , the Hermetic dictum that is fundamental to life states that the without is merely a hologram of the within .\nIf you have vision , then so to do those in your immediate world !\nWhat better gift to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful vision , a vision that arises from a clear heart and from clear , ego-free mind ?\nThe purpose of most spiritual disciplines is to be .\nFrom that state of emptiness , fullness is created .\nThis is why it is said that from chaos emerges order and from nothingness , everything .\nAnd it is no mean task , taking some Initiates many life times to reach a state of Samadhi .\nYesuah spent much of his youth in training to forsake the distractions of the physical world , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo too both Mohammad and Buddha .\nAnd yet , it is possible to touch that deeper , calmer place of knowing this coming It is beyond the scope of this article to account for the myriad ways possible to liberate your mind from the depression of living in the past or the anxiety of futurism , as there are many pathways to living within a more enlightened state , some more axiomatic than others .\nThe thesis of the Jupiter-Neptune alignment inclines the psyche towards non-dual , non-doctrinal pathways , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlimited possibilities of the imagination , the astral and the ethereal through lucidity of dreaming , through visualisation , through deeper forms of meditation , through music and the arts .\nThe writings and teachings of those born with this alignment makes for insightful understanding of how that couplet finds expression through the complex weave of the personality , such as Yogananda , Castaneda , Tolle , Dyer and Edward Cayce .\nThe Sun reflects the way in which your light reaches out into the world , whereas the Moon shines internally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the realms of your imaginal and reflective being .\nShould the presence of this synod touch those Luminaries , the opportunity to broaden and uplift your sense of who you are ; to soothe and open you up beyond the confines of your past ; to envision a world wherein the infinite is within reach ; to imagine the higher vibrational dimensions of the sign of those Lights ; and to encourage you to become comfortable with the person you are and are becoming , are but a few possibilities that feel more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mind ( Mercury ) and how you seek to perceive the world in which you walk , are opened up to a more insightful , soulful and imaginal landscape , drawing you deeper into the non-dual realms , opening your being to living in deeper accord with a philosophy that seek not to isolate or separate you from those in your world , and encourages the \u2018 language \u2019 of the universal to become more fluid .\nIf your Heart Light ( Venus ) is graced by this synod , then the awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Art , Heart and jOy is brought more keenly into focus .\nRelationships of the physical may not hold the same allure as those based in metaphysical principles , and seeking the heavenly in all thatyou create , or seek to \u2018 play \u2019 with ( in terms of creative expression ) will feel more apt .\nThe hunger to act from a place of expanded awareness , uplifting your desire beyond the notion of achievement and accomplishment towards a place of co-creativity and alignment with a more compassionate , understanding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mars in your chart be brought to the fore .\nRefinement of your diet , further pushing you towards purity and wholeness , casting asunder anything with more than ten ingredients ; along with a pull back towards Nature and the stillness that is offered when in connection with the elements , are but some of the invocations on offer as the Ceres archetype is triggered .\nWith Jupiter and Saturn , the focus falls upon growth , awareness and knowledge , the latter being concerned with gnosis and the former with exploration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine or maintaining the status quo , but of opening your awareness to a far outreaching possibility , encouraging you to go beyond the extant scripts and patterns that hold you to particular economic , political , social , educational and conditional parameters .\nAs you move beyond the world of the known , deeper and more subtle ecstatic experiences open up , as the realms of Chiron ( Healing ) , Uranus ( Insight ) , Neptune ( Vision ) and Pluto ( Restoration ) are invoked .\nThe experience of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of your psyche offer the possibility of stimulating the deepest recesses of who you are , akin to being on a continuous journey with plant medicine !\nDeeper levels of compassion towards the unresolved pain ( Chiron ) ; existential loneliness ( Uranus ) ; over-sensitivity ( Neptune ) ; and powerlessness ( Pluto ) can shatter open your being to becoming no longer caught in the past , and more accepting of who you truly are , beneath the layers of \u2018 stuff \u2019 that you have taken on-board .\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house wherein this synod transits , reflects the physical place in your psyche wherein you will literally experience this expanded vision .\nIt is also beyond the scope of this article to account for the specific meaning of the houses ( and aspects ) but they are both well documented and can be found on most astrological websites .\nYou will need to locate 24 degree of Pisces and which house it falls within , so that you can interpret what arena of your life is seeking to inflate beyond its current parameters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do not understand the technical dimensions of your birth chart , which for many requires the support of a professional .\nAstrology is a language of consciousness and merely places an \u2018 objective \u2019 perspective on the multidimsionality that exists within you .\nEverything that takes place within you has its origins in the rhythm of the cosmos and its unfoldment through you .\nBut you are not concretely fated .\nYou will co-create with these pulses , finding a way of personalising your own relationship with cosmic consciousness .\nWhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insight , add depth , give clarity and help you make more informed decisions regarding the language of the cosmos within you .\nBut you can do it by yourself , and I know you will still find your own way to express that cosmic consciousness .\nIt all begins with creating from a place of deep and unabated knowing .\nThe Law of Attraction only works when you are present in the moment and in an embodied manner , know , that what is to emerge is a true reflection of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true , it is the most powerful form of architecture .\nThis knowing comes from a place of true vision , a destination that has no bounds or concerns with the desires of the ego , which in turn is the telos of this conjunction .\nMy prayer for you is that you can find space and time within the distractions of a world that continues to perpetuate strife , division and fear , to empty yourself , to truly connect to a place that reaches beyond ego , and to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path , your connection to gOd and for your sOul .\nFrom that place , you will impact others around you , and together you can create your personal heaven here on Earth .\nI leave you with the words of Yoko Ono and John Lennon from their quintessentially Jupiter-Neptune composition , written during the second passage of the couplet during the 1971 Sagittarian alignment \u2013 Imagine .\nBlessings to you and all that you are doing for your path and also for ours .\nImagine there \u2019 s no heaven It \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below us Above us , only sky Imagine all the people Livin \u2019 for today Ah Imagine there \u2019 s no countries It isn \u2019 t hard to do Nothing to kill or die for And no religion ,

the playlist was to get a \u2018 feel \u2019 for the consciousness mood into which the collective hive mind created during previous conjunctions , as history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict and strife , inventions and science , than what is gradually emerging within the heart of society .\nTo gauge that the Arts are where to turn to , and I didn \u2019 t want to bombard you with literature quotes and images of hair and dress styles yesterday , and so I turned to the soul of the psyche , which is music , since music speaks multidimensionally in a way that worlds can not always do .\nIt is feeling and in-spiration , it is emotive and memory , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embodied and experiential and it relays truth to the heart , and contains wisdom that comes straight from the gOd realm .\nThe first few songs were conceived during the 1856 , 1690 and 1524 Piscean conjunctions .\nAside from the massive changes in music and therefore consciousness during those centuries , as music moved towards the centralisation of the composer as opposed to being of homage to Divine , as well as a change in tuning \u2013 moving away from Nature towards \u2018 Man \u2019 , and with instrumentation ( moving towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally no originals to be heard , because there was no recording devises !\nTherefore what is on the playlist is replications of the music that originated from that time .\nAnd , not much exists for 1524 because it was a time that the Church and therefore church music , dominated the European landscape .\n1690 is the time we associate with \u2018 classical \u2019 music and the start of opera , as the voice started to be used to display emotion , as opposed to give homage to gOd in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landscape resembles the early to mid 20th century music , as the guitar and piano were fully in use , even if there is still a heavy emphasis on \u2018 classical \u2019 music .\nThese songs reflect the Piscean genre , and 1856 was the first conjunction after Neptune was \u2018 formally \u2019 discovered .\nThis 2022 conjunction will be the second and I wonder what will cultural emerge that we can laterly reflect upon !\nThe other songs are from the

from his leering or smiling mouth , leaves and stems twist around the edges of his face , the Green Man is a fabled reminder of our deeper past wherein Nature and humanity lived together in both union

browns and greens of his body .\nA largely anonymous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Ragan in 1939 in an attempt to remind an industrialising world of its authentic , ancient and true origins , the Green Man has become a somewhat counter-cultural icon , adopted by those turning their backs on consumerist culture and returning to a more Nature-conscious reality in the late 1960s and early 1970s .\nRegardless

return here in infant form ?\nHumanity \u2019 s hubris believing that physical death can be cheated and that we can live forever is deeply ingrained within our collective psyche and has its origins within our sedentary , domesticated lives , as over time we separated ourselves from Nature and Her rhythm .\nAnd now we sojourn but briefly in Nature , her wildness tamed , her fauna domesticated , @

aromatic delights that the world can offer \u2013 the wafting of a freshly brewed morning coffee ; the freshly mowed grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the crisp ionised air that surrounds a babbling and cascading

Sagittarius MC and finishing in the 3rd house in trine to her Moon .\nThe sequence connects the 12th , 4th/3rd and 9th houses , in a way we may not otherwise .\nShe was busy writing with a new found inspiration .\nAt the same time , Saturn transited her 12th house , Jupiter her 5th/ 6th houses and her Sun , Pluto her natal Neptune and the Nodal axis her ASC/DSC .\nFor Tim Berbers Lee @ @ @ @ @ @

Jupiter conjunction at 29\u00b0 Cancer .\nThe Scorpio Star Point made a trine to his natal Mars at 9\u00b0 Cancer and the Mars retrograde transit began conjunct his Sun at 14\u00b0 Gemini .\nA great invention that would change our world was birthed .\nFor easier navigation through a chart stick to the peak points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember with Venus she will be here every 8 years , moving backwards over time and every 4 years making an opposing point , signalling a shift in perspective for this area of a chart .\nMars will be within the same area either in a 15 , 16 or 17 year cycles .\nSo from the examples above we may look closer at our own charts and how the coming peaks will target our charts in the year ahead .\nVenus stations retrograde at 26\u00b0 Capricorn on Dec 19th , 2021 Venus @

.\nWhat will be revealed in this time on the world stage will be significant in the year ahead , as previous Capricorn moving to Scorpio Star Points show .\nIn early 2018 we saw American Youth

greed and power .\nHowever the next retrograde of this Star point will be back at 0\u00b0 Scorpio for one more time in 2026 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Mars in Gemini retrograde cycle , 2022 is sure to open and change our minds to many new things , with new possibilities and social standards emerging and a stronger fight to uncover the information that is hidden from us , with a call to do something

: Emergence of new forms and of the potentiality of individual consciousness .\nJupiter now expands and accentuates this point .\nOut of the collective turmoil of the Pisces waters we now seek a new purpose for growth and expansion , as individuals claim their active place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many new beginnings all around , like Salacia with the mermaid 's tail .\nWhat will surface now as a conscious mission is the essence of Jupiter 's recent time in Pisces .\nAs he enters this new realm , it is time for new understanding and awareness to come to light .\nJupiter represents our living truth , not just about what we believe and philosophise about , but what we do with it in the real world .\nThe mantra 's for Jupiter are always `` practice what you preach '' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's hard to be a fake with Jupiter as truth is his realm !\nIn Aries , Jupiter now embraces the freedom and bravado to do just that , inviting many new experiences and adventure .\nAs a native of Jupiter in Aries , I can relate .\nThere is a radical spirit that comes to life with Jupiter in Aries , an impatience , a drive to move forward and not be held back .\nThere is care less attitude about judgements for what one does , with a great call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe combination frees us up , from ties and binds and expectations on how we should behave according to others .\nAs Jupiter now traverses Mars ' diurnal sign , things are up front and in your face .\nThere is a sense that it maybe time to fight or assert ourselves for what we believe , to fully live our truth .\n`` Coming Out '' in whichever way is needed are appropriate words .\nOur natal Mars will tell us more on how this passage will unfold , how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe .\nOur natal Mars will now get the next evolutionary training and infusion from Jupiter .\nAs a great teacher , we can look where Jupiter has been travelling through our charts and houses over the years and recognise where and how we have grown and wisened up in particular areas of life .\nWherever Aries is in our natal charts , will now be highlighted by Jupiter 's benevolence and uplifting spirit and show us reasons to believe in better ways forward .\nJupiter transits can be overwhelming and quite confronting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to make judgements and difficult decisions for the greater good .\nOverall this transit asks us to clarify our vision of life .\nThink back to the last passage here in 2010 and 2011 .\nWhat changed or shifted in your life back then ?\nOn the world stage In June 2010 Jupiter 's entrance into Aries , was met with Uranus , both at the powerpoint of zero Aries , not only had Wikileaks just released the `` Collateral Murder '' video of civilians being killed by US forces in Iraq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab world in response to corruption , economic stagnation , mistrust of governments , all ultimately leading to the Arab Spring uprisings , that spread across much of the Arab world as Jupiter re-entered Aries in January 2011 .\nWith the to and fro from Aries to Pisces still to come in this next round with Jupiter crossing the zero point of Aries 3 times in the next year , we will all be awakening any dormant spirits , resentments , or creative seeds awaiting in the depths to arise .\nAs this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just prior to a total lunar eclipse , the Ingress Chart shows a mutual reception to Mars in Pisces .\nWhat comes to light around this ingress and eclipse will set the course for the coming months ahead and to add to the `` alarm bells '' of shifts and changes is that Mercury is turns for his next retrograde loop .\nWorld 's can change during Mercury retrograde and eclipses , as new information comes to light or events change our course .\nSaturn continues to square the nodal axis , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing very quickly these days .\nSaturn in Aquarius overall has seemed to put the future on hold , but let us believe , as always , that what we are in now , is the great seed of what will be birthed from this time .\nThe same inflationary economy separating rich and poor , the same attitude to guns and war , the same draconic laws that serve the patriarchy , the ongoing lies and deceit of governments to stay in power , the same reliance on oil and gas that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2022 , like the Ingress of 2010 , shows a significant Jupiter Uranus aspect .\nWith Uranus mid Taurus at 45\u00b0 to the zero point of Aries , we can see Uranus also in the spotlight , and the eclipses on the axis of Scorpio and Taurus , all indicating the strong urge for collective , innovative and radical ways forward from our reliance on climate polluting fuels , gas , oil .\nThe midpoint dial below shows Uranus and Jupiter facing off , but if we look around the dial we also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other also 45\u00b0 apart , Mars and Venus straddle Jupiter and Mercury and Eris align with the Jupiter midpoint close to this time .\nIt will be very interesting what comes to the forefront at this zero point , these midpoints also also strongly activated .\nMay the truth be known !\nComing up on May 29th Mars enters his own sign to join forces with Jupiter at 3\u00b0 Aries .\nWhat makes this combination particularly potent is that they will both also be parallel by declination at zero N and S of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have written about this also in my SKY SPY column ( see page ) 35 , but worth mentioning again .\nAlarm bells sound a gain as the last time Jupiter and Mars met in Aries was May 2011 , when Osama Bin Laden was killed by the US in Pakistan .\nYet the last time Jupiter and Mars met at zero declination , was January 7th 1940 at 1\u00b0 Aries , and as we can recall , the second world war which started on September 1st 1939 was in full swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an escalation a turnaround by the end of May ?\nBy the time Jupiter returns to Aries for the solstice 21st December , 2022 , Mars will have been retrograde in Gemini , since the end of October .\nThe last time Mars was retrograde in Gemini was in December 2007 , a retrograde that began in Cancer and moved back Gemini and we lived through the a period of extreme stress in global financial markets and banking systems .\nwhich led to the Global Financial Crisis .\nJupiter and Pluto were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midst of the chaos of Pisces , overinflated lending systems began to fall apart , the banks were eventually bailed out , but many borrowers suffered greatly .\nA quick google search for the cause of GFC `` rising energy prices on global markets , leading to an increase in the rate of global

155 years prior , which correlates to the first industrial revolution , when we get a great leap in forward in technology , transport and textile production .\nNot surprising to find ourselves on the bridge between the next leap and great advance in technology .\nAs Chiron and Jupiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its consequences in a new light , as industry , production , over consumption , waste , pollution , climate change come into the foreground , as we work on ways to alleviate the poisons and work to heal the system , with alternatives to a greener new age .\nIt is always good to look back at these times for clarity and inspiration for what these signatures can bring with them and inspire us all to move intentionally ahead .\nThe next conjunction Jupiter makes in Aries is to wild and untamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of April 2023 , again during eclipses and a Mercury retrograde station , with the first eclipse in the Aries polarity at 29\u00b0 square Pluto , fresh in Aquarius .\nAs Saturn 's reign

"Eclipses only happen twice a year , in eclipse season , as the Sun and Moon align near or on the Nodal Axis .\nEclipses on the Taurus Scorpio axis only every 19 years , with the last eclipses on this axis in 2003 and 2004 .\nThe Scorpio/Taurus polarity puts the spotlight on matters of finance , resource management , trust issues , rising passions and the treasures that we keep and seek .\nThis axis is ruled by Venus and Mars .\nMars is currently in Pisces ( Venus \u2019 sign of exaltation ) reaching up for divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in Aries , Mars \u2019 sign , strives for independence and freedom in amongst our desirous and passionate natures and our relationships .\n\u201c It could be buried treasure or something that has been hanging around for too long in the recesses of awareness .\nIt could be something empowering , uplifting , or jarring .\nIt could completely change the course or the score .\nA total lunar eclipse in Scorpio is never lightweight .\nCircumstances could play out in some karmic , abrupt , or even life-altering way .\nYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catapulted into something unexpected .\nIt could be a new lifestyle or reality \u201d This Lunar Eclipse will be a TOTAL eclipse and as always with Lunar eclipses , will be visible where it is night time on the planet , this eclipse will last a few hours and turn dark red .\nAdding to the red nature of this eclipse , the Sun , although not visible during a lunar eclipse , will however be aligned with fixed star Algol , the blinking binary red star associated with the head of serpents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen in amongst the stars of the Head of the Scorpion \u2013 giving this eclipse quite an ominous quality !\nWith Saturn in square to this powerful lunar eclipse at its South Node and during a Mercury retrograde , something \u2019 s got ta give , something \u2019 s got ta take a different path , somethings may have to go , something \u2019 s got ta transform .\nFor many astrologers Pluto also rules Scorpio and therefore this eclipse , as well as Mars .\nThe power to transform something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be guided by instincts and actions , ( remember Mars is with Neptune ) and Pluto is forever slowly transforming the system in Capricorn , it \u2019 s all part of the evolving cosmic plan !", "author": "AGENT 12 - JULIJA SIMAS", "url":

there was sound .\nThat sound is carried upon a Great Wind , ever blowing and every constant .\nThat sound , along whose unseen path presence builds its quiet procession , is the source everything that is created .\nIt is what carried your Soul into being as your emanations arose from its tonal vibration , forging those pathways that make up your unique patterning and your soul \u2019 s essence .\nThat sound gives rise to your breath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , while has echoes in eternity , carries on it your voice and its tone , the intention of those words that you choose to project onto your sound being the vocal expression of your soul .\nWhat you breathe contains within it the memory of all that you are and all that you have been .\nYour voice , in turn , is an expression of how you breathe ; it is an expression of what you believe ; what you say is an expression of your Soul \u2019 s essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of where you are in yourself and the nature of your Soul .\nWhat you say and how you say it will have an impact on your world in the same way that what you listen to and how you listen will have an impact on your soul .\nThe first thing that you do when you come into being is to draw forth air .\nThe last act that you will experience as you leave for spirit is to let your breath go .\nAnd all through your life , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen ; a perpetual rhythm that varies according to psychological state .\nIf you favour one state over the other , atrophy takes place .\nThe trick is to balance both \u2013 to stand at the gateway between those two states .\nReflect for a moment on the two seas that are contained within the boundaries of Israel \u2013 The Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee .\nThe latter is teaming with life , while the former contains no life at all , yet they are both fed by the same river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea of Galilee receives water at one end and gives water at the other .\nThe Dead Sea only receives water , as it has no river from which it drains .\nSo it is with life and your breath .\nIf you only receive or only give , you will not truly live .\nWithin the astrological tradition the act of giving is called Cardinal and the act of receiving is called Fixed .\nHowever , the two way interaction between your life and the lives of those around you is contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through those moveable signs that you are reminded that to live , to feel , to be and to breathe is a two way process \u2013 receive and give ; give and receive .\nDuring the lunation of the 30th May 2022 , the pathway of breath , Gemini , is offered to you to reappraise the quality of the ideas that have settled within you and how they are truly reflected in the world around you .\nAfter all according to the spiritual traditions , the manner in which the world surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYet maintaining the consistency of your own breath can be a challenge because you are not living within an isolated bell jar separate from those within your environment .\nAnd this does not take into consideration the anxiety of watching what you share and receive whilst living within an immature reality wherein you can not have opposing/ contradictory views .\nFurthermore , this \u201c air \u201d you inhale deeply into your being is not simply there to aid you to receive the necessary oxygen to keep you alive !\nIt allows sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried on those light and sound waves .\nThe quality of the sound and light that you give permission to penetrate your Being is important as you become what you think about in the same way that you are what you eat .\nThe nature and quality of your thoughts has an impact on the world that you perceive and subsequently on your interaction with your world .\nThe natural exchange of information from you to someone else not only leads to a cross-pollination of perspectives but it empowers you to acquire knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of your life , supporting you to make more informed decisions .\nMoreover if you flick the switch and open up your third eye , there are in-sights that arise from beyond this plane , whose purpose is to serve the evolution of your humanity , as you tune into a consciousness that \u2018 sees and hears \u2019 the sounds and light that our regular senses don \u2019 t .\nIt is those very impulses that enable us to gain deeper meaning to any exchange that we encounter and further opening up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with greater tolerance , understanding , compassion and respect .\nRemember the teachings from the gospel of Thomas , verse 22 \u2013 \u2018 When you make the two One and you make the inner even as the outer and the outer even as the inner and the above even as the below \u2026 then you shall enter the kingdom \u2019 .\nAs two eyes and ears become the One , the heart and mind no longer exist separately and promote dualism , just as the ability to hold a space for contradiction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mutable Air ( Geminian ) lunation holds an additional balancing emphasis as the celestial lights stand between the two of the Watchers of this realm and the Pillars of Time , or Incarnation , ( Aldebaran and Antares ) .\nThese red-orange stars are gateways to our physical incarnation and excarnation path , as the mysteries of the mind and heart are revealed , complimenting each other as the in-sights from the all-seeing eye is balanced by the all-feeling heart .\nTheir presence within our collective hive consciousness gives rise to our ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enabling us to raise up our humanity and to live openly and comfortably within the Cartesian split prevalent within this plane of reality .\nTheir presence during this Mutable Air lunation opens up a slightly deeper question beyond \u2018 what do you breathe in \u2019 , but from where do you breathe in ?\nDo you allow the insights from the Eye that Sees penetrate your being , filling you with in-sight and meaning or do you merely respond from a de-compartmentalised rational mind ?\nFurthermore , the question also arises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ?\nDoes it come from a place rooted in love , compassion and trust or a place of fear , isolation and anxiety ?\nIn other words , does it come straight from Spirit or has it been filtered and diluted by the egoic Mind ?\nAs our world continues to move through this profound redistribution of power , you are being challenged to raise up the vibrational intention of your humanity beyond the binary dualism of us against them as a multitude of drugs are being pushed to dumb you down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth .\nThe message of this lunation is nicely summed up within the Lakota prayer that I \u2019 d like to leave you with , in the hope that you are able to take time to see and hear beyond the distractions of the \u2018 two \u2019 , so that you can stand in the middle where the one resides .\n\u201c Teach me how to trust my heart , my mind , my intuition , my inner knowing , the senses of my body , the blessings of my spirit .\nTeach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may enter my sacred space and love beyond my fear , and thus walk in balance with the passing of each glorious sun .\n\u201d",

As the closest to Earth and the fastest , the ancients saw the Moon as the vital connector between all of the planets , a go-between , the conveyor of messages and the revealer of secrets .\nThrough studying the monthly waxing and waning of the silver Moon in all its phases and mapping its intricate dance through the heavens as one by one , each of the other heavenly bodies was advanced upon , embraced and then discarded , they were able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , and over millenia learned to predict what was to unfold .\nFor up to a week before a Full Moon , we may well experience a feeling of pressure , as our bodies become aware of the growing power and it is at these times that events often come to a head , sometimes accompanied by an outpouring of emotion .\nThe next Full Moon falls at 23 degrees 25 minutes , in the last decan ( 10 degree segment ) of Sagittarius .\nSagittarius travels through varied physical and mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and is noted for its love of study or long-distance travel in order to expand its consciousness .\nStrongly associated with the image of the perpetual student , the Sagittarian interest in religion , philosophy and the workings of law and government , only broadens their territory , giving them immense landscapes in which to explore their enduring love of knowledge and the pursuit of a strong sense of faith and meaning .\nWith this however , can come the tendency for dogma , as the desire to believe in something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be magically replaced by something new at a later date .\nGenerally optimistic and positive with boisterous energy levels and a restless independence , the Sagittarian type keeps going towards the goal of understanding , often eschewing the confines of ordered living and conventional attachments to make room for the eternal search for complete freedom of expression .\nThe Sagittarius Full Moon which is always the last Full Moon before the Summer Solstice comes at the very end of the ancient Egyptian calendar , which renews every year as the Sun reaches its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zodiac sign of Cancer .\nIn ancient Egypt , this time was marked by the heliacal rising of Sirius and the yearly inundation of the Nile river , bringing renewed life back to the parched desert .\nUnder the rulership of Saturn this last decan of the ancient year is associated with The Ten of Wands in the tarot , and embodies the burden which material reality lays upon the fiery energy of inspiration ; it represents the physical struggle required to complete the journey .\nThe image from the Picatrix that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c A man with a hat on his head , killing another man \u201d whilst the Sun , which at the full Moon is in the opposite sign , occupies the last decan of Gemini , and given the image of \u201c A man covered in chainmail , with a bow , arrows and a quiver \u201d .\nThis full Moon occupies the last decan in a series of 36 and as such , brings us the opportunity to review what we have learned over the year , with the instruction to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still serve us , while urging us to discard those that will no longer prove useful for the next cycle .\nThrough Sagittarius we learn and gather , through Gemini we teach and disseminate ; this is the time to let go of what is not worth teaching , but to hold on to that which has useful meaning , good enough to be stored , and eventually passed on to others .\nThe Full Moon is always a time of release , when there is nothing further to be gained and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who has Sun , Moon or Ascendant in Sagittarius or Gemini , or personal planets at the end of Sagittarius , this Full Moon may feel particularly relevant .\nTen is always connected to the idea of renewal , the wheel turning and that the time has come once more to reap what we have sown .\nThe combination of images suggests the closing of a particular fate cycle and that it is time to part ways with something , or maybe someone .\nYou may come to the understanding that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that you are unable to continue under the current conditions .\nIn some manner , a belief system that has served you well in the past , must now be laid aside , as it has outlived its purpose , for it is time to look elsewhere for new inspiration and a different road into the future .\nThe applying square that the full Moon makes to Neptune fills this particular time with uncertainty and confusion , it may be difficult to ascertain what it is you even want to release , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense is being left behind .\nWherever Neptune is in play , results are achieved by \u201c non-action \u201d , its function to erode and enchant , to confuse and dissolve whilst we look on , powerless to affect the course of events .\nIn due course we look back and realize that everything has changed .\nThis Full Moon is about accepting that you can no longer hold on , that a new way beckons , beyond what you can visualize , and to trust in the process .\nIn the glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , revealing my truth .\nThere are no secrets here , all will be declared .\nNow it is time to turn away from that which is no longer fulfilling .\nI empower you to live your authentic self , to be unashamed of your fullness , to embrace your power , to proclaim your true self , without fear .\nIn Sagittarius-I Seek : to know all that I can , to experience distant places , in all realms .\nI am a traveler of far off lands , which exist on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in water .\nI learn , I gather , I expand my awareness ; I delight in all new experiences .\nI constantly add to my store of knowledge and experience , bringing back tales of adventure and teaching .", "author": "AGENT 41 - JOANNA GRANT", "url":

UTC Ever feel like there is something missing ?\nThat our world is somehow incomplete ?\nGutted , dreams shattered by an old man to fearful to let him pursue his vision , he rises from the dinner table and takes his leave to consider his fate .\nQuickly ascending the stairs two at a time , he exits the dark and dreary stairwell of his home-prison and enters the fading purple light of dusk .\nEyes cloudy with unspilled emotion , head weighed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longings , this young , idealistic farmhand , he nonchalantly kicks away dust from beneath his right foot as he gravitates towards the western horizon , that place wherein our Shadow looms large as we seek to free ourselves from all that binds us to this world before we descend into the underworld , to gaze forlornly at the sky scape .\nA dewy French horn strikes a long and haunting D , offering a new hope as it ascending a perfect fourth to F , before wavering and faltering as it trembles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the binary suns set over a barren desert horizon .\nIconic , a scene etched into a seven year olds mind \u2019 s eye , mirroring a recurrent dream that I had had since the age of 3 or 4 wherein I hiked to the top of a hill , ahead of a group of faceless but friendly souls to watch the Two set over a lake .\nPure fantasy or a distant memory of something , somewhere else ?\nDoes art reflect reality or vice versa ?\nAfter all there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a dreamer that consciously knows and creates , bringing into form from the liminal world , their spirit , and the fantastical delusion of pipedream based in an ego unwilling to draw forth from that inner vision .\nSurely there is nothing true about a fictional planet orbiting two Suns in the far reaches of a galaxy far , far away at a time long , long ago ?\nPerhaps not , after all ancient stories have talked about our Yang Yellow Star missing its Yin companion as we are one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binary .\nWhether our companion is as the Egyptian \u2019 s believed , the Spiritual Sun behind our Sun , Sirius ; or Jupiter , so large replete with all the composition of what makes a Sun a Sun , that never quite made it to Sun-status or deflated down to planet-status ; or the Oort cloud that never gathered itself to create that companion from the ribs of the first man ; or that she was banished from the Garden for not consenting to subjugate herself to the whims and entitlement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companionless star is enshrined within the motifs of the zodiac as Cancer gives way to Leo .\nThe iconography of the zodiacal signs and planets yields profound wisdom to those who read symbols , after all what is astrology but a multi-dimensional , non-linear language of consciousness , which enables the interpreter to translate differing meaning to the seeker in accord with where that initiate is on their path .\nThe image of Cancer , often depicted as a pair of women \u2019 s breasts , is simply composed of two of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glyphs \u2013 the circle of spirit and the semi-circle of soul .\nThe semi-circle gently touches the circle and at one level shows the arced path of the Sun \u2019 s ascent through the gateway of incarnation , the East door , cresting loudly and majestically upon its southern throne at the height of the day-light , before falling towards the Western door , where it will leave the Light and return to the Dark .\nThe second Sun journey \u2019 s through the depth of the interior world , again being led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the disincarnate realms , before connecting with the dream beyond the dream , and ascending towards the East portal to re-embody itself as a physical being .\nTwo spirits , both led by a liminal experience , one that journeys within the world of light and one that journeys within the world of night .\nTwo Lights , one yang , the other yin , delicately balanced , rhythmically dancing in a Sufi swirl , cyclical , yet spiralled .\nTwo stars to light our way , the path of action and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become and contentment of being ; the exploration of the visible world and that of the invisible and intangible .\nEnshrined within the Christian story , more clearly seen if the glyph for Cancer is turned on its side , we have the Johannes the Baptist and Yesuah the Messiah , whose symbolic birthdays are celebrated at the two Solstices , a time in the annual cycle where the Sun stills , heralding the height of Summer or the depths of Winter .\nReflecting on this side view of Cancer , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its perch high up in our Summer skies , following the arc of the ecliptic towards the Nadir , where it coldly settles low on our horizons at mid-Winter , before again following the arc up and out into the glory of the hot Sun .\nWithin the esoteric tradition it is said that souls manifest in pairs , one heralding the other , both inseparable , both equally poised to balance out their tasks within this plane of existence .\nThe Essenes , a mystical sect from which Jesus ( Yesuah ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught in pairs , a male and female initiate , whose paths interwove around each other .\nSimilarly is the relationship between Johannes the Baptist and the Christos , Yesuha .\nJohannes anoints the Christos , recognising and acknowledging the incarnate gOd ( Sun ) within the physical realm ( Summer ) , who had come to Earth to show us the path inwards ( Winter ) .\nThe image to the right is from Sant Nicholas in Siggeiwi in Malta and it depicts the anointing or baptism of the Christ , via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the Magdalene , whose Light has been intentionally hidden from view , but whose quiet presence co-exists with that of the Christ , recently recognised by the Vatican , not as a prostitute but as the apostle of the apostles .\nMoreover , in the apocryphal Aramaic Gospel of the Nazarene , Yeshua states , \u201c I and my bride ( Kaltra ) are one \u2013 just as Mariam the Magdalene , whom I have chosen and sanctified as an example , is one with me \u201d .\nThe word bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also mean an inner bride , or the feminine principle .\n( quoted from Lars Muhl , The Light within a Human Heart , p129 ) From a pagan perspective , this birth of the Christos \u2019 birth is celebrated at the end of the Winter Solstice , just as the Sun starts its climb up and out , as the disincarnate gOd becomes incarnate , moving from inner to outer .\nThe celebration of the baptism takes place at the end of the Summer Solstice , just as the Sun starts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards its death and rebirth .\nMoreover , many of the Egyptian pyramidal temples remember the disincarnate Sun through their astronomical alignments to Sirius , a star that heliacally rose heralding the flooding of the life giving Nile to the quench the thirst the desert plains , reminding us that growth without sOul is sterile .\nAnd yet , something is missing .\nIs the absence of our Yin Sun the reason why patriarchal viewpoints have relegated all that is quintessentially feminine \u2013 reflection , space holding , instinct , intuition , symbiosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holistic \u2013 to the dusty back shelves , as that Yang gOd is honoured and worshipped literally and figuratively ?\nDid that occur as the catastrophist and psychoanalyst Immanuel Velikovsky wrote \u2013 that the conflict on the Earth was shaped by the extraordinary developments of our planets and Sun within human history ?\nOr is it merely symbolic of this missing Yin Sun ?\nAnd yet the symbolism of the two Suns is encoded within the glyph for Cancer .\nTherefore the second Sun does exist !\nIt is currently within .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outer light with instinct , feeling , intuition and the dream .\nIt is the interior light that radiates meaning , vision and sOul .\nIt is the liminal radiance that illuminates all that is the imaginal .\nIt is the light that enables us to find our way in times of forlorn , disappointment and disillusionment , mirrored in that evocative scene in Star Wars where Luke gazes at the setting Suns , aptly symbolising the necessity to pull away from the world to feel the Force and follow it blindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun will be revealed , but I feel it is more than apt that this Second Sun exists within each of us , a Sun that guides us internally , and whose light prompts us into an outward expression of sOul , deep feeling and proactive use of the emotive senses , qualities that anyone with planetary archetypes within this zodiacal sign know all too well .\nLuke was a twin , his sister hidden from him to protect them from a father who had been driven mad with visions of his beloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are partial to sci-fi or otherwise , Star Wars is a modern myth that tells the story that the power of the Force is only complete when balance is obtained between these two fundamental states \u2013 Yin and Yang , and enshrined within our psyches as the perception filter called Cardinal Water or more commonly , Cancer .\nAs the Sun and Moon unite early in the European morning this coming June 29th , it is a timely reminder to not lose hope and to listen deftly to your inner light , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vicissitudes of our egoic world .\nBlessings to you and the rekindling of hope , a state of consciousness that actively creates from a place of the heart .", "author": "AGENT EI - ANDREW SMITH", "url":

"cosmicintelligenceagency", "title": "Black Moon Lilith \u2013  From the Visceral to the Sublime", "content": "The Black Moon is a virtual astrological point , which represents the lunar apogee .\nI will refer to it as Black Moon Lilith ( BML ) in this article , to differentiate it from other astrological points ( such as the asteroid Lilith or the Dark Moon ) .\nThe apogee is the point in the Moon \u2019 s elliptical orbit around the Earth at which it is furthest away from the Earth .\nIt is at this position that it almost escapes , but doesn \u2019 t !\nFor it is right there that the pull of gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back towards the Earth to continue its orbit .\nSo here we recognize the first basic concept related to Black Moon Lilith : gravity .\nIsaac Newton would refer to this as a question of mass and distance .\nBML takes nine years to go around the Zodiac staying approximately nine months in each sign .\nThis adds a second basic concept to the discussion , that of human pregnancy , or gestation .\nBlack Moon Lilith is about bringing things down to Earth , concentrating mass , materializing and forming a body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the womb experience , like the foetus that does not see , does not think , in words and meanings , but simply senses things such as warmth and cold , tension or relaxation or the sense of experience being pleasant or unpleasant .\nIt is akin to the reptilian brain , the most basic level of the human brain that is in charge of basic survival .\nIt concerns issues of life or death .\nBML represents the survival instinct and the unspoken sensations the mother experiences through pregnancy .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s own intentions or official narrative .\nRather than being in the realm of just the unconscious , BML is about the real and raw experience , senses and sensations registered in our bodies .\nWhilst the \u2018 White \u2019 Moon can tell us about the \u2018 official \u2019 experience of the mother , family and surroundings , the Black Moon tells us about the visceral experience of mother during pregnancy .\nBlack Moon Lilith accounts for the deep , visceral , crude sensations .\nRather than words and images , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , presence-absence , and comfort-discomfort .\nIt is not only irrational \u2013 but blind .\nBML indicates the experience itself , previous to its elaboration in images and/or words .\nIt is interesting to note that the Portuguese word for pregnancy is \u2018 gravidez \u2019 , with the same root as \u2018 gravidade \u2019 , gravity .\nBML refers to gravity , gestation , materialization , bringing down to Earth , materializing the body .\nIt is indicative of both difficulty and talent !\nIt is about our most visceral level and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential for the terrifying or sublime .\nThe mythology of Lilith informs us further and deeper about the conceptual content of this astrological point .\nHowever , it does not account exclusively for all its richness .\nThe same wild , visceral aspect of the feminine is also expressed in other myths from different cultures , such as those of Hecate , the Hags , Durga , Kali or Maleficent .\nDifferent cultures will also present different ways to relate to this visceral and wild feminine aspect of human experience .\nWhile in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 the untameable first wife \u2019 of Adam , before Eve , in Hindu religion , Kali is seen as another aspect of the same , Parvati ( the wife of Shiva ) .\nKali represents Parvati \u2019 s own mutation , where the logical male aspect does not respect the creative force of the feminine .\nWhen this visceral aspect regains respect and consideration , the feminine once again presents itself as the lovely and devoted Parvati .\nBut hey Shiva !\ndo not underestimate the power and value of the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kali !\nBlack Moon Lilith can be calculated either for the True Node or relative to the Mean Node .\nThe True Node moves as a \u2018 zigzag \u2019 , going retrograde and direct , back and forth , jumping from one sign to another and back again , while eventually moving forward .\nThe Mean Node draws a line , showing its direction , never retrogrades , and actually indicates the main tone for that visceral level during a period of approximately nine months in a sign .\nThe True Node can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mean Node indicates the effect .\nAlthough both are interesting to observe and the True Node does add important information , it is the Mean Node that gives the \u2018 effect \u2019 .\nKeeping track of the Mean Node should be the priority here as it clearly marks out a nine month period in each sign , with its transit indicating what is going on in the undercurrent aspect of our collective .\nWHAT DOES BLACK MOON LILITH REFER TO IN COLLECTIVE TRANSITS ?\nBML speaks of the tone or of what moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points to the instinctive undertone of a particular period , it reflects a backdrop behind our words and images at any given moment..\nIt is about what \u2019 s moving the collective at the visceral level \u2013 describing a certain tone , certain warmth and associated collective sensations .\nThe sign in which the BML falls tells us about what kind of difficulty is encountered in the context of visceral impulses ; as well as what kind of great visceral power exists !\nThis can involve a great difficulty or a great talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we experience our greatest challenge to overcome ourselves in order to thrive.. As a simple wise man from the forest once said : \u201c Difficulty is the very same size as Ease \u201d .\nIt is the challenge that makes victory possible and a visceral challenge provides opportunities for visceral talent !\nThe drive and impulse represented by BML that has not found a way of instinctual expression gets \u2018 loose and lost \u2019 within the body .\nIt is like having constant pressure that has no outlet or no defined direction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if pulled by gravity , and experienced as constant repetition .\nSuch a compulsive pull needs to be put into creative action , as a committed effort in order to move beyond destructive compulsion .\nSuch a primal force is best converted into creative expression , anchoring an actual inner transformation at the most condensed , basic and root level .\nThat is how one goes beyond being subjected to sheer , raw and instinctive reactions and becomes able to truly respond to the presence of BML , owning oneself , @ @

they see fit , opening and closing the rule book at will , also able to cleverly evade capture .\nThe underbelly of this dynamic is revealed by the Full Moon reflecting the Sun \u2019 s position in the 3rd Decan of Cancer , illuminating that which up until now , may have remained hidden .\nOf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c \u2026a turtle with a serpent in his hand and golden chains before him .\nThis is the face of running , riding and acquiring profits in war , disputes and conflict.\n\u201d The Moon , here in her own face or decan , is powerful indeed , able to shine a bright light on the complex imagery of serpents , golden chains and profiteering from war , because as we can see from a simple scan of the news , there is plenty of that going on right at this moment .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said that solid achievement is not possible without the attendant obligations , for positions of power can not be accepted without the heavy burden of responsibility attached .\nEvery lofty position comes with its own expectations and duties , the loss of personal freedom often being the hidden price that one pays for any position of authority .\nThe temptation that comes with great influence is often that of hubris , not only for those who sit prominently at the top but also for the invisible figures who move silently in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capricorn and Cancer have a strong association with the archetypes of the Father and the Mother and this full moon will be activating these images powerfully within the collective .\nGeneral issues to do with parenting may be forcefully emerging ( as we have seen recently in the recent legislation changes in the U.S. ) and these , together with our own experiences within our families of origin are likely to lead us toward reflecting on Capricorn \u2019 s concern with duty , responsibility , and the application of rules .\nWe may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all against strictures inherited from our birth families and forgoing etiquette and protocol we may finally take the plunge and become a more authentic version of who we really are .\nFor some , this full moon will mark a time where it becomes possible to let go of a \u2018 childhood dream \u2019 of how it all \u2018 needs to be \u2019 and finally embrace a more \u2018 adult \u2019 version of reality , one where they can stand in their own strength and to tell their own story , without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family myth .\nThis image works equally well on the collective level , and we can currently see this trend growing ever stronger , especially in the last number of weeks as more and more of the disenfranchised stand up for what they believe is \u2018 right \u2019 against governments and leaders who continue to disregard the real needs of the people .\nRight now we have huge demonstrations taking place in various parts of the world as those impatient with government policy ( read \u201c parents \u201d ) try to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe US has seen massive protests in regard the recent legislation on abortion and as I write , the UK government is in disarray as key ministers have resigned in the face of what they perceive to be continued inept leadership .\nIn the Netherlands , Poland and elsewhere , farmers have mounted blockades , demonstrating against unpopular policies that target food production whilst all over the world , from Ecuador to Iran , Argentina to Sri-Lanka , people are protesting against rises in the cost of food and fuel , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign associated with learned wisdom , experience , tradition , the slow steady trek to the top , the necessity of discipline , and of limitation , and the symbol of the Capricorn goat beautifully reflects the nimble and seemingly impossible feats of mountain goats as they navigate the steep slopes on which they live .\nThe symbol of the goat can also be associated with the scapegoat which traditionally refers to a person or group who is made to bear the blame for others , or to suffer in their place .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ goat was let loose in the wilderness on Yom Kippur after the high priest symbolically laid the sins of the people on its head .\nIn more recent times , the term scapegoating has been used for the practice of blaming someone else for one \u2019 s own problems , a process that can result in feelings of prejudice ; scapegoating can serve as an opportunity to explain failure or misdeeds , whilst maintaining one \u2019 s positive self-image .\nIt can be all too easy to pass the blame onto others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or those in charge\u2026 the \u201c parents \u201d for the misdemeanours of the \u201c children \u201d .\nIn this way , we only give our own power away , give it away to those who have more taste for it perhaps , relinquishing our right to make a choice in the way things will be .\nSo the message for this Full Moon is to ask : Where have we given up our own power , for the sake of an easy life ?\nWhere have we tuned out of what is really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of responsibility ?\nWhere have we chosen the easy life , the route of least resistance ?\nWhere have we said YES when really our heart was screaming NO ?\nHow has this worked for us , do we feel empowered in our lives , do we feel in charge ?\nIt is time to stand in our own strength , to become great in the face of overwhelming adversity and to recognise the \u2018 mirage \u2019 of \u2018 top down \u2019 power .\nAs we cut loose from past situations that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we may find ourselves fearing the change we have lusted after .\nHow will we manage this new responsibility ?\nWill we act in the right way , or will we fear the new sense of power , will we bring shame upon ourselves and weaken and crumble under the burden ?\nIt is only natural that our ancient fears surface under the Capricornian ray , feelings of doubt dogging the longed for permission to break free of restraint .\nActing with self interest often arouses fears of being judged , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of letting others down ; all these may emerge at this time to keep us in our place , to keep us small as we struggle to stand strong and bear the weight of the decisions that we have made , the decisions to do what is right for us .", "author": "AGENT 12 - JULIJA SIMAS", "url": "https://cosmicintelligenceagency.com/full-moon-in-capricorn-21-21-power-in-excess-13th-july-1837pm-utc/", "published": "Sun, 10

"Setting the Scene into the 2020\u2019s  and The Role of Astrology in our World", "content": "Astrology and the last 20 years Looking back at the last 20 years , seeded by the previous Jupiter- Saturn cycle which began in Taurus , in the year 2000 , we have witnessed huge issues arise and attention directed to the systems that govern our money , investments and resources .\nThis is not surprising , given that this was the last in a series of 10 conjunctions , over a period of 200 years , taking place in Earth signs .\nA potent astrological signature of our Industrial Revolution , but also , the shift of Pluto into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sagittarius , this period was preceded by the process of linking us all up , as the global internet superhighway spread its tentacles and influence , www , google and social media opened our connectivity and information sharing .\nWe were woken up and connected like never before and we had information , news and entertainment streaming off our fingertips .\nThe two Venus transits of 2004 and 2012 , in Gemini , also occurred during this period .\nAs rare as they are , occurring once only every 120 years 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of significant change in human evolution shows them as large significators of all this as well .\nWithin this environment the whistleblowers arose , the fake news got worse and transparency was demanded , as the frivolity and ludicrousness of how we treat our fickle environment set off alarms bells .\nYet it all continued to open our minds , our awareness and our access to information sharing , whilst continuing to connect us with like minded groups and brand new cyber friends from our mobile phones .\nThe past decade opened with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a tsunami joined by a nuclear threat , the spread of the global uprisings stemming from the Arab Spring of the early 2010 \u2019 s and the Occupy movement targeting the imbalance of the 1 % .\nAlthough our C*I*A had already been functioning for many years , it was during these times and the beginnings of the Uranus-Pluto square that we witnessed significant attention coming to astrology .\nThis wasn \u2019 t only because of Ophiuchus and the ongoing saga of claims that astrologers don \u2019 t know what they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13th sign and our zodiac is misaligned , but through the connectivity of astrologers and the sharing of our information .\nIt was also linked to the global unrest and mistrust of how we were being informed .\nIt was never a priority at our C*I*A to set scientists scepticism to rest , but rather to continue showing and explaining the mundane correlations of what was happening in the world and what archetypal signals were noticeably playing out , delivering our message in our astrological language .\nIt became clear to a wider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet made a lot of sense especially as we described Uranus in Aries and Pluto in Capricorn and its seeding moments stemming back from the radical shifts and attitudes of the 1960 \u2019 s .\nPeople could relate and they grew more interested in what astrologers were saying .\nThey started asking intelligent questions , looking at their charts , learning about cycles and getting to know the language .\nAt the C*I*A it was always part of our mission , to speak an astro language , and not dumb down , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe wanted our public to understand and see astrology working beyond SunSigns , with a better understanding of our language .\nWe became trusted teachers and enticed them to connect with the visible moving planets and track them in the night sky .\nSimple things , like the way the planets move every night , to the positions of Venus or Mars and even eclipse cycles , laid the road to further intrigue for those that had never previously comprehended celestial movements or how our Earth turns amongst them .\nThe Uranus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astrologers and astrology OUT there , and into the world , bringing the associated changes , accompanied by technology and our phones , with individuals raising their voices and profiles\u2014and so too Astrologers .\nSocial media has been a blessing for all of us all , helping to get the word out there and to get the masses turned on to it again .\nThis all changed people \u2019 s perception of our heavenly art .\nThe Astrology of NOW became the new thing , the language of astrology got to be known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our culture once again .\nNow we see the language of astrology OUT THERE , we hear millennial \u2019 s speaking about it on trains , even on their own channels .\nWe see it mentioned in news and films , and even act as a topic for more intelligent and philosophical dinner conversations .\nIt seems so au fait to mention all this now , but when i started astrology this was definitely not the case .\nThose who used it kept much of it to themsleves , or were even scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as something strange and weird and made for hippies and new age dudes .\nAstrology is now a real job , a viable career , a prospect for those who study the craft , or just a jump on the bandwagon with or without qualifications or training for many others .\nWith Uranus in Taurus now and until 2026 we will see many more substantial changes to the monetising of the ancient knowledge , and the trivialisation of our sacred craft .\nWithin this particular passage of time and given the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could also do very well to nurture the growth and interest in astrology , into fruitful outcomes and more substantial developments .\nFor now we have become used to the floating memes circulating , some fabulous and fun , some demeaning and embarrassing to our craft .\nThis will always be the case , and we can only hold ourselves together to raise the light , standards and the value of astrology .\nUranus , the Agent of Change , has since its discovery been related to the Higher Mind , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as do all outer planets , to the expanding heavens and our expanding consciousness .\nSince ancient times Ouranus in myth has been the god of the heavens .\nMany astrologers would call Uranus the ruler of astrology .\nIn ancient times it was Mercury that ruled astrology , as the connector of above and below , the Greek Hermes , the scribe of the heavens .\nIt is too tricky to trace astrological developments over time through the trickster , as his movements are fast and his cycles non-uniform .\nHowever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Uranus , even just by sign , we can see quite a definitive archetype revealed in the use and types of astrology that surface in our world during these times .\nUranus cycles through the zodiac with a neat seven years in each sign .\nWhile the longer cycles of Neptune and Pluto do not enable us to follow the nuisances of our rapidly changing dynamics , their cycles are still important to consider as they are also big and influential , cosmic beacons and reflectors of the great shifts of mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2007 I came across a PDF online written by the late Robert Blaschke , where he wrote on the shifts in astrological fads , growth and themes around Uranus and North Node conjunctions .\nSince , with a few computer changes etc , I can no longer find this PDF , nor find it online .\nBut below I explore this theme with a brief timeline of the past 50 years .\nFor this exercise I use Uranus , as the key significator , keeping in mind the backdrops of Neptune and Pluto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the changing landscape .\n\u2013 Rise of psychological astrology \u2013 Delving into the psyche with Astrology

what Uranus in Cancer will bring 2032-2039 ?\nAstrology may well be taught by mums or dads at home as millennials become parents , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , places dedicated to astrology , maybe even Temples could arise .\nWhat a lovely thought !\nA particularly interesting and super creative period awaits us when Pluto enters Pisces , Neptune will be in Taurus and Uranus in Leo in the 2040 \u2019 s .\nBy no means is the above intended to be an extensive study , but it does point out the flavour of what we find as the outer planets , and especially Uranus , transit the signs .\nThere are some big planetary shifts ahead , including Pluto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Aries in 2025 and Uranus into Gemini in 2026 .\nAir and Fire qualities will be dominant , what we see now may just be a glimmer , compared to where this may all go !\nIf the net and social media changed the face of astrology , one can only imagine how our new cyber world , and the Internet of Things will continue to give us leverage and space to fly .\nI am reminded as I write this of a line about astrology in the late middle ages .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ human life was a belief almost universally held by all instructed men from 13th to 16th century.\n\u201d 2 It does seem as though we are far beyond these times , as the astrology of now is for all , not just the instructed ones .\nAs much as we may like to see it more contained , or valued and respected , it has nevertheless been unleashed .\nPeople who use astrology don \u2019 t need to believe in it , and some don \u2019 t feel a deep need to contemplate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is seen as a tool for self development rather than as a vehicle for commands from the Gods and as always and perhaps one of its most timeless qualities , is that it keeps itself up with the times and the changing worldviews .", "author": "AGENT 12 - JULIJA SIMAS", "url": "https://cosmicintelligenceagency.com/2020settingthesceneinto-2020-2/", "published": "Sat, 25 Jun 2022 00:43:24
