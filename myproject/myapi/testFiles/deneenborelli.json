at the expense of our strategic partner Ukraine .\nFortunately , German regulators refused to approve the pipeline , effectively delaying the certification of the project before July 2022 .\nAs part

years ago .\nCalcasieu Pass and Sabine Pass Train 6 , based in Louisiana and Texas respectively , will soon come online and export LNG to many nations .\nPoland is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military confrontation with Russia .\nIt is also committed to reducing its dependence on Russian gas .\nPoland will soon import over a third of its gas supply from the U.S. , and no longer fear that Russia will shut off its energy supply as it has done in the past .\nOther European nations have also signed supply contracts with U.S. producers to diversify their gas supply .\nFortunately , the U.S. is already moving in this direction .\nGas has generated considerable income in 2021 for US oil and gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary for a successful energy transition .\nNow is not the time to undermine this progress by restricting US LNG exports .\nProviding our allies with an alternative to Russia and Qatar strengthens US national security .\nNotably , the price of U.S. LNG can encourage lower prices

influence geopolitics beyond Europe .\nThe U.S. has recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nDespite geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing , China has recently committed to a significant volume of

"content": "HARRISBURG \u2013 Last month , seven environmental groups wrote a misguided letter to Philadelphia officials bashing legislation that I sponsored as counterintuitive to the city \u2019 s decarbonization goals .\nIn October , six Democrats , including two from the southeast corner of the state , joined all 28 Republicans and our chamber \u2019 s lone Independent to approve Senate Bill 275 .\nThat \u2019 s a veto proof majority , for those counting .\nWhy ?\nBecause the bill \u2019 s purpose is simple : it prevents Pennsylvania \u2019 s 2,500-plus municipalities from banning access to certain utilities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This will preserve consumer access to affordable electricity , no matter where they live , and prevent a chaotic patchwork of regulations that ultimately undermine statewide environmental and energy policies .\nIt also reaffirms what many local and statewide officials , including the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission , already understand to be true : municipalities do not have the authority to restrict energy sources .\nWhat the bill does not do is prevent Philadelphia City Council from pursuing its goal to retrofit all publicly owned buildings to reduce emissions 50 % over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just about ripping out gas lines and oil tanks and installing heat pumps instead .\nReducing electricity usage \u2013 through upgraded windows , roofs and insulation \u2013 is also a crucial piece of the puzzle .\nThe aforementioned environmental groups said that SB 275 will eliminate any hope of Philadelphia reaching carbon neutrality by 2050 .\nWhich begs the question , if the only way to achieve decarbonization is by indiscriminatingly banning utilities deemed \u201c dirty \u201d and \u201c bad , \u201d is that even a good plan ?\nIsn \u2019 t there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting all your eggs in one basket ?\nBanning specific fuel sources in pursuit of \u201c clean energy \u201d makes zero sense in Philadelphia and beyond .\nFirst , clean energy is a misnomer .\nThere \u2019 s simply no such thing .\nEven if we shuttered every coal and gas plant across the world tomorrow and began a frantic campaign to install wind and solar farms in their place , we \u2019 d need to cover about 1.8 million square kilometers of land and coastline to replace the lost capacity .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of those solar panels and wind turbines .\nJust like we need oil and gas to create and distribute nearly every product we use every single day , from the medications we take to the clothes we wear to the packaging we use to preserve our food .\nTo assume that banning fossil fuels will only impact emissions and electricity prices is to ignore the intricate web that is our economy .\nBesides , the city doesn \u2019 t exist in a vacuum .\nIt \u2019 s connected to a vast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manages the safe and reliable flow of electricity for 65 million people from Chicago to Washington D.C. and many places in between .\nPJM \u2019 s operators ensure that its network of transmission lines and generation facilities work in tandem every minute of the day , preventing system overloads that could trigger massive utility failures and inflict untold suffering on millions in its territory .\nSo , if electricity demand spikes in Philadelphia , but environmental policies have forced fossil fuel plants into nonexistence , there are fewer reliable energy sources to shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Texas in February when an unprecedented winter storm froze generators and rendered solar and wind farms useless , leaving more than 4 million residents without power or water for days .\nMore than 200 people died amid the chaos .\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas , the state \u2019 s grid operator , promised to winterize its system to harden it against future storms , but the damage was done .\nThe rest of the nation should take note : a diversified and robust grid is key to preventing systemwide catastrophes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of banning access to fossil fuels .\nIf we are willing to sacrifice our food , clothing , shelter and transportation , doing so might eliminate some carbon emissions in the United States .\nGlobally , U.S. emissions equal about half of what China produces on an annual basis , according to 2018 figures .\nThe annual combined emissions from the other three top polluting nations \u2013 India , Russia and Japan \u2013 would likewise take our place .\nThen there \u2019 s the emissions from sources we can \u2019 t always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest fires .\nOr the damage caused by human activity like deforestation and degenerative agriculture .\nEven if the United States found a solution to every single unsustainable practice that critics say contributes to climate change , the rest of the world \u2019 s leading nations aren \u2019 t following suit .\nSo what do these groups really want from the city ?\nThey want officials to take a sledgehammer to our carefully planned and managed power grid , collapse our economy and leave Pennsylvanians with higher electric bills , fewer jobs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reducing carbon emissions that will be offset by the rest of world , in perpetuity .\nProtecting energy choices for consumers means that residents can pursue \u201c cleaner \u201d electricity sources if they want to or can afford to , while not punishing those who don \u2019 t have the option .\nSB 275 isn \u2019 t about protecting special interests \u2013 what does a senator from Williamsport owe to Philadelphia \u2019 s gas utility ?\nWhat I do care about is promoting sound

\u2019 s exceedingly poor performance is not surprising .\nBiden was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his inability to pursue the right course on issues is carrying through as president .\nHowever , it \u2019 s a

RealClearPolitics \u2013 and a national TV audience \u2013 he was not prepared to say that the coming midterm elections would be legitimate , White House press secretary Jen Psaki was saying the exact opposite Thursday during television interviews , on Twitter and twice to reporters in the briefing room .\nThe clarification may have come too late .\nBefore Psaki could do damage control , both Vice President Kamala Harris and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn , the Democrat perhaps most responsible for making Biden president , seemed to amplify a message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disavow hours later .\nIt all started with a routine press conference question Wednesday but ended with an answer that crowded out some of the positive headlines the administration had hoped to earn on the one-year anniversary of Biden \u2019 s inauguration .\nIf his preferred election reforms didn \u2019 t become law , asked Allison Harris of NewsNation , would the midterms be fair and legitimate ?\nBiden hedged .\n\u201c Well , it all depends on whether or not we \u2019 re able to make the case to the American people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to try to alter the outcome of the election , \u201d the president said , referring to Republican-controlled state legislatures engaged in their own changes to voting laws and implying that the legitimacy of those elections remains in question .\nWhen Biden later called on RCP , the president was asked to clarify that response .\nGiven the state-level efforts his administration believes restrict voter access , did he believe that the next election \u201c would in any way be illegitimate \u201d ?\nHe didn \u2019 t hesitate this time .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c I think it easily could be illegitimate.\n\u201d And then the president turned his attention to the last electoral contest .\n\u201c Imagine if , in fact , Trump had succeeded in convincing Pence to not count the votes , \u201d he said .\nRCP interrupted to clarify : \u201c In regard to 2022 , sir \u2013 the midterm elections.\n\u201d \u201c Oh , 2022 , \u201d he replied , before returning to finish his last thought about 2020 .\n\u201c I mean , imagine if those attempts to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have to recount it and we \u2019 re not going to count \u2014 we \u2019 re going to discard the following votes.\n\u2019 \u201c I \u2019 m not going to say it \u2019 s going to be legit , The increase and the prospect of being illegitimate is in direct proportion to us not being able to get these reforms passed , \u201d he continued , tying passage of his preferred federal voting rights legislation to the legitimacy of the midterms .\nThis was a challenge , Biden said , his party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate Democrats could not get his preferred election bills into law .\n\u201c You \u2019 re not going to see me , and I don \u2019 t think you \u2019 re going to see the Democratic Party , give up on coming back and assuming that the attempt [ to pass those measures ] fails today , \u201d he said .\nHours later , a bipartisan majority consisting of all Republicans and Democratic Sens .\nJoe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema doomed that congressional effort .\nAnd while the president would say in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the United States Senate has failed to stand up for our democracy , \u201d the administration did not seek to clarify the president \u2019 s legitimacy comments until the next morning .\nCapitol Hill woke up to a statement from the White House press secretary .\n\u201c Lets be clear : @ potus was not casting doubt on the legitimacy of the 2022 election .\nHe was making the opposite point : In 2020 , a record number of voters turned out in the face of a pandemic , and election officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those votes counted , \u201d Psaki tweeted .\n\u201c He was explaining that the results would be illegitimate if states do what the former president asked them to do after the 2020 election : toss out ballots and overturn results after the fact .\nThe Big Lie is putting our democracy at risk .\nWe \u2019 re fighting to protect it , \u201d she concluded .\nHarris had already finished an interview with the CBS morning show before Psaki pressed \u201c send.\n\u201d Gayle King asked the vice president about next steps now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate .\nHarris said that the risk of \u201c attacks on our democracy \u201d remained ongoing .\n\u201c If you boil it down to it , one of the specific issues is that folks are making it \u2013 people in elected offices and states are making it more difficult for their citizens to vote , \u201d she continued .\nClyburn expressed similar concern , addressing the legitimacy question explicitly on CNN .\n\u201c Are you concerned that without these voting rights bills the election results won \u2019 t be legitimate ?\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a confidant of the president , replied , \u201c I \u2019 m absolutely concerned about that.\n\u201d When Psaki made her Fox News debut Thursday , the press secretary heralded Biden \u2019 s year-one accomplishments , joked about the Cincinnati Bengals \u2019 playoff chances , and denied that the president was questioning if the United States would have free and fair elections come November .\nPsaki insisted that Biden \u201c absolutely is not predicting that the 2022 elections would be illegitimate .\n\u2026 The point he was raising was both that in 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suppress the vote in the midst of a pandemic , there was record turnout , [ among ] Democrats and Republicans , record turnout to go to the polls.\n\u201d What the White House considers a clarification was the product of late night and early morning conversations between the president and his advisers , though the new statement came well after Biden \u2019 s initial remarks .\nThe day after , Psaki told reporters , Biden was \u201c actually attempting to make the opposite point , \u201d namely that despite the pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a record number of Americans did cast votes .\nAt the White House press briefing Thursday , Peter Alexander of NBC News quoted Biden \u2019 s words from the day before .\n\u201c When a reporter followed up , the president said to him , \u2018 I \u2019 m not saying it \u2019 s going to be legit .\nThe increase in the prospect of being illegitimate is in direct proportion to us not being able to get these reforms passed , \u2019 \u201d he said before asking again : \u201c So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , if all remains as it is right now , that the elections this fall will be legitimate ?\n\u201d Psaki answered , \u201c Yes , \u201d insisting again that Biden was talking about the 2020 election , not the one in 2022 .\nAlexander asked again , \u201c If there are no changes in terms of voting rights legislation going forward , the president does still feel confident that the elections this fall will be legitimate ?\n\u201d Those statements from the White House did little to assure liberal activists who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off what they see as threats to the right to vote , particularly among racial minorities and young voters .\n\u201c There is a lot of uncertainty , \u201d Charly Carter , executive director of the progressive Democracy Initiative , told RCP Thursday evening , noting that \u201c what it feels like to vote and whether people have confidence in their election system depends on where they live .\n\u2026 Whether or not you have confidence in the election shouldn \u2019 t really depend on your ZIP code , but in this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Democrats \u2019 election reform efforts has failed in the Senate , Carter said the battle over voter rights and access \u201c is a movement issue now.\n\u201d She pledged activists would fight , reinforced by an army of lawyers , at the state and local level to ensure free and fair elections .\n\u201c Everybody is going to be out fighting ; it \u2019 ll be hand-to-hand combat in every in every county.\n\u201d Sen. Mitt Romney didn \u2019 t buy any of the clarifications coming from the White House , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former president in Biden \u2019 s Wednesday claims .\n\u201c It is a damaging assertion ,

.\nAnd yet , they \u2019 re going down the same path.\n\u201d Biden ended his day at a fundraising event , where he reiterated that the 2022 midterms are \u201c critical.\n\u201d After his majorities

on the surface , it sounds like a good idea .\nAfter all , who doesn \u2019 t want to be against racism ?\nThe problem is that \u201c anti-racism \u201d is a linguistic trick .\nInstead of condemning all forms of racism , it seeks to combat one form of racism with another .\nBy doing so , it only perpetuates racial division and strife , harming everyone .\nHow should Christians understand the difference between a common sense opposition to racism and the ideology of anti-racism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of addressing this issue .\nIn 2007 , U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts authored an opinion in a case that addressed the legality of plans used by two public school districts to assign students to specific schools .\nBoth schools employed racial quotas to make the assignments .\nIn striking down the quotas , Roberts memorably stated , \u201c The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\n\u201d Contrast that to another memorable line , this time from author Ibram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c How to Be an Antiracist , \u201d Kendi , a well-known scholar and proponent of anti-racism ideology , opined , \u201c The only remedy to racist discrimination is antiracist discrimination .\nThe only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination .\nThe only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.\n\u201d I think both Roberts and Kendi would agree that racism \u2013 harboring animosity and hatred for others based on their race and treating them differently based on race \u2013 is a great moral evil .\nNot only that , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afflict American society , and that work must be done to end it .\nThey part company , however , on how to combat racism .\nOne would call for an end to all racial discrimination ; the other would \u201c fight fire with fire , \u201d so to speak , by meeting one form of bigotry with another .\nUnfortunately , several public school districts across America are rejecting Roberts \u2019 vision in favor of Kendi \u2019 s .\nTake , for instance , Albemarle County Public Schools in Virginia , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February 2019 .\nDuring a staff orientation , a district leader who helped develop the policy made its implications clear .\nHe told staff to think about whether they were on the \u201c anti-racism school bus , \u201d whether they \u201c need help finding your seat and keeping your seat , \u201d or whether \u201c it \u2019 s time for you to just get off the bus.\n\u201d So , what does it mean to be \u201c on the anti-racism school bus \u201d in Albemarle County ?\nThe answer given by the district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white students , it \u2019 s becoming aware of and repenting for \u201c white privilege.\n\u201d And for everyone , it \u2019 s fighting against and dismantling \u201c white-dominant culture.\n\u201d Through its implementation of this policy , the district has indoctrinated staff and students alike in a bizarre understanding of racism and race relations .\nStaff were told that racism is \u201c the subordination of people of color by white people.\n\u201d Students , in turn , were taught that racism is \u201c the marginalization and/or oppression of people of color based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileges white people.\n\u201d Moreover , students were told that \u201c people who are white , middle class , Christian , and cisgender \u201d comprise a \u201c dominant culture \u201d who \u201c chose the damage and rules , \u201d while \u201c black , brown , indigenous people of color of the global majority , queer , transgendered , non-binary folx , cisgender women , youth , Muslim , Jewish , Buddhist , atheist , non-Christian folx , neurodiverse , folx with disabilities , [ and ] folx living in poverty \u201d were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anti-racism , then , means fighting against the \u201c dominant culture \u201d by contesting \u201c white supremacy , white-dominant culture , and unequal institutions and society.\n\u201d Some of those racist institutions include such things as believing in \u201c colorblindness , \u201d \u201c remaining apolitical , \u201d believing there are \u201c two sides to every story , \u201d and holding the wrong views on political issues like border security , immigration , criminal justice reform , and school financing .\nThere is much more , but these examples drive home the point .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the words of Columbia professor John McWhorter in his book \u201c Woke Racism , \u201d \u201c a form of racism in itself.\n\u201d In his words , they teach white people to \u201c do \u2018 the work \u2019 of becoming \u2018 antiracist \u2019 in their every waking moment and to despise themselves for lapses in doing so , despite that it is a work they are condemned never to finish.\n\u201d And just as perniciously , it teaches that \u201c to insist that black people can achieve under less than perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McWhorter rightly condemns as \u201c disempowering.\n\u201d McWhorter is right .\nAnd his critique alone is a sufficient reason to reject the racism embedded in Albemarle County Public Schools \u2019 \u201c anti-racist \u201d curriculum .\nBut the problem goes even deeper , especially for the Christians singled out by the school district .\nThe ideology at play in Albemarle County is an affront to the Gospel .\nChristians understand that racism directly contradicts the teaching of Scripture that we are all equally fallen in God \u2019 s sight , equally loved by Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the sacrificial work of Jesus Christ .\nThose truths obligate us to reject racism and condemn it as a moral wrong .\nAnd that same duty compels us to reject and condemn the Albemarle County Public Schools curriculum .\nWhy ?\nBecause it labels , divides , stigmatizes , and condemns students based on race .\nFor some , they are labeled and condemned , solely based on their race , as part of a \u201c dominant \u201d culture that perpetually oppresses others .\nFor others , they are labeled and stigmatized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture that is perpetually oppressed .\nFor both , their race becomes the defining characteristic in their life .\nNot their moral character .\nAnd certainly not their status as infinitely valued creations of a loving God .\nAt its core , anti-racism , which draws heavily upon modern critical race theory , locates evil outside the human heart , in institutions and \u201c hierarchies \u201d of oppression .\nAnd it locates the solution in \u201c dismantling \u201d those structures .\nThat won \u2019 t work , of course , because , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c the line separating good and evil passes not through states , nor between classes , nor between political parties either \u2013 but right through every human heart \u2013 and through all human hearts.\n\u201d We must reject anti-racism ideology , then , because it advances a lie \u2013 that discrimination can be cured with more discrimination , bigotry with more bigotry , and that society can be changed if we dismantle enough institutions and bludgeon our students into accepting their place in anti-racism \u2019 s twisted hierarchy of oppression .\nSo what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth wherever we can .\nFor example , just recently , my law firm , Alliance Defending Freedom , filed a lawsuit against the Albemarle County School Board on behalf of a courageous group of parents and students challenging the district \u2019 s new curriculum .\nThe parents hail from diverse racial backgrounds and diverse branches of Christianity .\nThey are united , however , in teaching their children that all people should be treated with equal dignity , love , and respect , regardless of their race , color , or creed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a stand for truth .\nAnd that stand will make all the difference .\nRyan Bangert is senior counsel and vice president of legal strategy with Alliance Defending Freedom ( @ ADFLegal ) , which represents parents and their children who have filed suit against the Albemarle County School Board .", "author": "Deneen Borelli", "url":

shot this past Tuesday in just a matter of hours .\nThe violence commenced with the afternoon murder of a 15-year-old high school freshman , Caleb Westbrook , who was killed in broad daylight as he walked home from school on Chicago \u2019 s west side .\nThe ages of the victims shocked even a city very accustomed to war-like street violence .\nChicago \u201c won \u201d the dubious title of

people were shot in Chicago in 2021 .\nLocal health care workers have become so proficient at treating gunshot wounds that the U.S. military sent medical staffers to Second City hospitals to train before deployment to war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan .\nPart of the explanation for the street violence lies in a totally broken public school system that works well for the Chicago Teachers Union but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of them black and brown children without alternative options to the government schools monopoly .\nHow bad it that systemic failure ?\nWell , according to a 2019 University of Illinois study , a shocking 45 % of young black men ages 20-24 in Chicago are neither in school nor employed .\nAdding to the city \u2019 s woes in 2022 , public school students missed the first five

September 2020 , this parent group shifted their attention to curriculum concerns exposed through virtual learning .\nFor instance , in spring 2020 , Mequon Thiensville paid $ 42,000 for Blaquesmith

Average power prices in Connecticut , which has the dubious honor of edging out California for the most expensive electricity in the lower 48\u2014are 80 % higher than the national average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data , and only likely to worsen going forward .\nIn late January , benchmark natural gas prices delivered to Boston reached $ 28 per million British thermal unit ( MMBtu ) .\nOn an energy equivalent basis , this corresponds to paying $ 162 for a barrel of oil .\nIt \u2019 s also more than 500 % more expensive than one could pay for natural gas just 200 miles away in Pennsylvania \u2019 s Marcellus basin .\nMoreover , prices averaged $ 20.55 per MMBtu ( $ 119 per barrel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicating that the eye-watering prices were not confined to just a short-lived spike .\nThe economic ripple effects are significant .\nNatural gas accounts for 53 % of year-round electricity generation in New England ( compared to just 15 % in 2000 ) and a similar fraction of home heating demand , so when prices stay elevated , the regional economy suffers greatly .\nWith New England \u2019 s relative dependence on oil for electricity and heat , also tops in the country , oil prices spiking to the highest in eight years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury , it \u2019 s important to remember that higher energy prices act as a regressive tax , disproportionately burdening poorer households and those on fixed incomes .\nIt \u2019 s also well understood that demand begets supply , which in turn can lower prices .\nIn a report just last week , the Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) cited pipeline constraints in the Appalachian Basin as a primary reason that energy producers have limited their response to rising prices .\nOf course , high energy prices are what prompted scrutiny of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the question should be asked\u2014would blocking U.S. LNG lower prices for New Englanders ?\nThe answer here is decidedly no , and the root cause is once again pipeline constraints .\nAs New England grid expert Meredith Angwin testified in a February 1st hearing before the Connecticut legislature : In other words , the lack of pipeline capacity makes New England increasingly dependent on global gas markets , and with the U.S. now leading the world in LNG exports , restrictions on those exports would only drive global prices higher , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noting that a ban on LNG exports wouldn \u2019 t increase the amount of U.S. LNG available to the Northeast .\nThat \u2019 s because the century-old Jones Act\u2014which limits trade between U.S. ports to American-flagged ships only\u2014effectively prohibits LNG imports from the Gulf Coast .\nInstead , New England pays top dollar for cargoes from Trinidad , Nigeria , and occasionally even Russia .\nFinally , a separate EIA report is forecasting that overall domestic natural gas prices will remain flat in 2022 and 2023 even as exports rise , reflecting American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while also delivering growing supplies to allies and partners around the world .\nIt is certainly true that New England could be an outlier in this forecast , but only because of its inability to readily access plentiful U.S. production less than 200 miles away in Pennsylvania .\nSo while we agree with the senators concerns about high energy prices , a holistic look at the situation reveals that LNG is simply not the problem .\nInstead , the most daunting energy challenges facing the Northeast trace back to the same solution .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ on energy imports , we should build more pipelines .\nIf we want to burn less dirty fuel oil , we should build more pipelines .\nAnd if we want lower prices , the answer isn \u2019 t less exports , it \u2019 s more pipelines .\nDan Byers is vice president for policy at the

to Russia \u2019 s economic rescue , would the United States consider inflicting some financial pain on Beijing ?\n\u201c One of the things we will have to watch is the question of whether the U.S. will impose secondary sanctions on China , \u201d said Jacob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security Program of the Center for a New American Security .\nThe Trump administration sanctioned the Chinese military in 2018 for purchasing military hardware from Russia , a violation of sweeping American sanctions levied as punishment for the Kremlin \u2019 s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election .\nSimilar sanctions , or the threat of them , could potentially scare off the Chinese from coming to Russia \u2019 s aid .\nA former adviser to then Vice President Joe Biden on Asia policy , Stokes said \u201c The play might be : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relatively constructive manner , in exchange for some restraint from the U.S. in terms of secondary sanctions ?\n\u201d Although White House aides would not comment on that possibility , Biden may have subtly hinted at some kind of collateral repercussions for China .\n\u201c Putin will be a pariah on the international stage , \u201d the president said .\n\u201c Any nation that countenances Russia \u2019 s naked aggression against Ukraine will be stained by association.\n\u201d The two spheres are seen as connected , even if tangentially .\nChina may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian aggression in Ukraine as something of a dress rehearsal for how they might react to a Chinese invasion of neighboring Taiwan .\nBiden insists America will remain resolute in its support

for Russian Minds", "content": "From the start of Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2019 s invasion , Ukraine has proven a worthy opponent in the fight for minds .\nUkraine \u2019 s narrative has prevailed .\nRussia has virtually no country taking its side .\nEven China \u2019 s support is questionable after Putin presumably lied to Xi Jinping that he would not invade .\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has not fled to safety , and the strong resistance against Russia \u2019 s invasion from three sides has won Ukraine global admiration and support .\nGermany has executed a historic about-face from business as usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de-facto leader against Russia \u2019 s war in Ukraine .\nThere is but one deviation from Ukraine \u2019 s public relations victory : The Russian population has swallowed Putin \u2019 s fable that Russia is threatened by an aggressive Ukraine and NATO , poised to invade unless Russia hits first .\nBut Ukraine is not satisfied to cede Russian public opinion to the Kremlin .\nInstead , they are going after the weakest point in his narrative ; namely , that Ukraine will collapse when confronted with Russian \u201c special operations.\n\u201d Putin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people lies in that very last term .\nHe implicitly promised Russians an antiseptic operation that would return Ukraine to the Russian fold where it belongs .\nUkraine , with its fierce resistance , has dispelled Putin \u2019 s claim of victory without casualties .\nDuring the 2014 war against Donbas separatists , Putin ordered casualties to be strictly hidden via hidden burials and intimidation of families of fallen soldiers .\nAccording to the official line , there were no casualties , other than the few accidents that are bound to happen .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , Ukraine \u2019 s interior ministry has just opened a website : Ischi svoikh \u2013 Search for your own .\nThe service is directed at Russian families of soldiers possibly in Ukraine .\nThe website is https : //200rf.com .\nThe 200 refers to the notorious \u201c Cargo200 \u201d refrigerated trucks that transported the bodies of Russian soldiers killed in Donbas in 2014 back to Russia for burial .\nIschi svoikh announces that \u201c at the present time , 4312 persons killed .\nFrom these , 1169 can not be identified .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ information will be regularly updated.\n\u201d There is no independent confirmation of these numbers , but they are shocking even if we divide them by ten .\nThe portal directs readers to a website where they can fill out their personal data along with information about the young men feared dead or captive inside Ukraine .\nSuch information potentially gives Ukraine a database of parents and relatives of young soldiers to whom Ukraine could deliver its message .\nIschi svoikh has begun to release the photo IDs of Russian soldiers killed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons , with more to be added regularly .\nIf skeptics wish to check whether these soldiers are really dead , the documents give names , addresses , and responsible persons .\nPhone their families and see what you learn .\nAs the war began , the Kremlin tried to follow its 2014 script of hiding combat deaths .\nRussia \u2019 s Ministry of Defense has described military operations but has issued not a word on casualties .\nThen came a reluctant concession , which suggests massive casualties : Russia \u2019 s army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and injured \u201d soldiers among its troops in Ukraine , without saying how many .\nA Moscow army spokesman said on state television .\n\u201c Unfortunately , there are killed and injured among our comrades .\nThe spokesman went on hollowly to \u201c praise their courage and heroism.\n\u201d Another indicator of unexpectedly high casualties is the Ministry of Health \u2019 s letter warning of a \u201c major medical event \u201d requiring doctors to be drafted from across the country .\nThey are warned to \u201c be ready.\n\u201d Putin clearly did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses .\nTheir blitzkrieg should have finished Ukraine by now .\nQuite a surprise !\nIn another twist designed to prevent Putin from again concealing casualties , Ukraine has called on the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) to perform the humanitarian work of returning soldiers \u2019 remains to Russia .\nUkraine notes that \u201c the ICRC can act as a neutral intermediary on the return of bodies and other humanitarian issues in the conflict , including missing persons and reuniting families.\n\u201d Looming as another problem for Putin are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTheir major complaint so far is that their conscripted sons are supposed to be exempt from service in combat areas unless they give their own consent .\nThe mothers complain that their conscripted sons are taken to the Ukrainian border , forced to sign contracts making them regular soldiers to be put into battle with little or no training .\nA final grassroots source of information about casualties in Ukraine : The Russian Orthodox churches read out the names of departing souls on special days in the church calendar .\nParishioners attending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names of draft-age young men .\nThey clearly understand what is going on .\nUkraine learned valuable lessons from the first Russo-Ukrainian War of 2014 .\nThey learned the importance of winning hearts and minds , not only of allies but also of enemies .\nPutin \u2019 s mainstay has been his ability to convince the Russian people of his \u201c fortress Russia \u201d view that the West wants to wipe Russia and its enlightened leadership off the map .\nTheir reward for going along with this narrative is a \u201c Great Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them by Vladimir Putin at no cost .\nNothing else can explain why the Russian people are willing to go along with the first European war since 1945 .\nBut will they hold to the Kremlin \u2019 s myths when they realize they are

American Energy Is Key to Undermining Putin\u2019s War", "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2019 s bloody and unhinged campaign to topple a democratic nation once subjugated by the former Soviet Union has resurrected the threat of global conflict from its deep , dark Cold War-era grave .\nIt \u2019 s easy to paint the invasion of Ukraine as the delusions of a narcissistic despot desperate to cement his legacy as the man who muscled Russia \u2019 s way back to the top of the world superpower list .\nIn doing so , we ignore the uncomfortable truth : Putin spent years bolstering Russia \u2019 s economy with oil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West \u2019 s race to renewables left them vulnerable and dependent .\nAs a natural consequence , any imposed sanctions meant to cripple Russia \u2019 s energy sector will reverberate across the globe , cutting countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) the deepest .\nThis is what I , and many others , mean when we say energy independence is a matter of national security .\nAnd this is why short-sighted climate policies \u2013 like forcing Pennsylvania into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative ( RGGI ) and cancelling natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XL pipeline chief among them \u2013 are so very dangerous .\nPeople across the world , not just in Ukraine , will die from the leverage Russia holds over global energy exports .\nHow much control does Russia have , exactly ?\nThe EU is the largest importer of natural gas in the world and 53 % of their supply came from Russia in 2020 alone .\nIn the United States , about 11 % of our crude oil imports came from Russia last year \u2013 a smaller , albeit significant chunk that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war against Ukraine escalates .\nSome analysts believe crude oil prices may reach $ 150 per barrel this summer , up from roughly $ 50 just two years ago when American energy policy prioritized independence .\nPresident Trump , love him or hate him , cautioned western Europe about the risks of relying on Russian natural gas .\nGermany ignored those warnings and closed much of its nuclear and coal generation facilities in an effort to reduce carbon emissions .\nUnfortunately , Germany now finds itself in a very serious dilemma of failing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its decisions .\nGermany isn \u2019 t alone in its shortsightedness .\nDemocratic leaders in western nations , acting on behalf of wealthy green energy donors , fail to see the big picture time and time again .\nIt doesn \u2019 t matter how many countries signed the Paris Climate Agreement if all of them also allow China to ramp up its emissions over the next decade .\nPollution knows no borders .\nRenewable energy accounts for less than one third of global energy supply and remains notoriously unreliable .\nThat \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EU , Russia made a lucrative deal to supply China with 100 million tons of coal .\nWe can attack Putin \u2019 s assets and Russia \u2019 s banks all we want , but so long as he \u2019 s cornered a sector of the energy market , his imperialist ambitions will not subside .\nBut all is not lost .\nThe United States can change course .\nWe can ramp up energy production with the same urgency we experienced when manufacturers pivoted to make masks and ventilators at the onset of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies meant to restrict oil and gas production and exports .\nWe can greenlight Keystone and other pipelines .\nAnd we can unleash our plentiful gas supply right here in Pennsylvania to help with that mammoth effort .\nPennsylvania , according to the Energy Information Administration , remains number two in natural gas production nationwide and became the largest supplier of electricity in the United States in 2020 .\nIn Pennsylvania alone , more than half of households use natural gas to stay warm .\nOur 49 underground storage sites also remain key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That \u2019 s why Gov .\nTom Wolf must abandon policies meant to hamstring the industry , like his devotion to RGGI or his alignment with New York on halting infrastructure that could supply New England with cleaner , cheaper Pennsylvania natural gas instead of \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Russia \u2019 s inferior product .\nBut Wolf isn \u2019 t the only one standing in the way .\nOur country still bans liquified natural gas ( LNG ) cargo ships from delivering between domestic ports unless registered in the United States .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriers , none fly the U.S. flag .\nThis law , known as the Jones Act , was enacted in 1920 and leaves us entirely dependent on foreign transports to deliver LNG when pipelines aren \u2019 t feasible .\nThe same law prevented production facilities in the southern U.S. from delivering to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria ravaged the island in 2017 .\nThink of how much the world has changed in a century , let alone from just a year or two ago .\nWhere is the logic in buying from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it easier to use what we produce ourselves ?\nIs there any recognition of the common good \u2013 or are we just nuts ?\nRussia has now weaponized its natural gas supply and soon it will squeeze ancillary industries like fertilizer manufacturing and ultimately , food production .\nIf you control the food supply , you control the people .\nIt \u2019 s a brutal tactic Russian dictators of decades past know all too well .\nOur elected officials must set aside their allegiance to green energy lobbyists and turn up gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s war machine without setting a single foot on foreign soil .\nAs a nation

"Commentary: John Kerry \u2013 Putin\u2019s Useful Climate Idiot", "content": "Vladimir Putin \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine marks the end of the West \u2019 s Era of Illusions .\nIt was an era in which Western elites obsessed about solving climate change because the climate crisis was far more dangerous than issues of war and peace and the stability of the international system .\nThey even convinced themselves that climate change causes war , so climate change policy could double as national security policy ; and , for many years , the annual round of kumbaya UN climate talks was the apogee of international relations .\nIn a BBC World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kerry expressed concern about the amount of greenhouse gas being emitted from the war in Ukraine .\nKerry was just getting warmed up with a string of platitudes that show him as a deluded climate relic , unable to come to terms with the reality that Putin has imposed on the world .\n\u201c Equally importantly , \u201d Kerry complained , \u201c you \u2019 re going to lose people \u2019 s focus , \u201d as if the first invasion of a sovereign European country since the Second World War is an annoying distraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would realize that Russia \u2019 s land is thawing , and the people of Russia are at risk .\nKerry concluded with an expression of pure self-deception , saying he hopes Putin \u201c will help us to stay on track with respect to what we need to do for the climate.\n\u201d Stay on track ?\nRussia has never hidden its intention to avoid cutting its emissions .\nRussia \u2019 s second Nationally Determined Contribution , submitted in November 2020 under the Paris climate agreement , is to limit its 2030 emissions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990 levels.\n\u201d The document is careful to avoid pledging to cut or reduce emissions .\nThe 1990 baseline year was the last one before the collapse of the highly inefficient and heavily polluting centrally planned Soviet economy .\nThus , the 70 % limit actually enables Russia to increase its emissions by 34 % \u2013 and that \u2019 s before taking account of any changes in forestry and land use that would allow Russia to claim credit for negative emissions .\nDespite Kerry \u2019 s claim about the thawing of their frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change predates Putin \u2019 s rise to power .\nDuring preparation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \u2019 s ( IPCC ) first assessment report in 1990 , Soviet scientists argued that warming might be beneficial at northern latitudes .\nYuri Izrael , the Soviet academician and chair of the IPCC \u2019 s working group examining potential impacts of global warming , emphasized the doubt and uncertainty of climate change and disputed claims that it would be harmful .\nAt a 2005 conference on avoiding dangerous climate change organized by Britain during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former economic adviser , Andrei Illarionov , challenged the premise of the conference .\n\u201c Anyone who is frightened about the prospect of global warming is welcome to come and live in Siberia , \u201d Illarionov told a journalist .\nIndeed , a strong case can be made that Russian climate scientists have a better understanding of climate science and the likely impact of rising levels of carbon dioxide on global temperatures than their colleagues in the West .\nIn testimony to Congress in 2016 , John Christy , the Alabama state climatologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center at the University of Alabama in Huntsville , compared 102 climate-model simulations against observed global temperature of the mid-troposphere from satellites and balloons ( the troposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere , up to a height of around 33,000 feet ) .\nOn average , the models warmed the atmosphere at a rate two-and-a-half times faster than what happened in the real world .\nThe only model that produced simulations close to observations was the Russian INM-CM4 climate model .\nSmall wonder Russians are disinclined to believe

college , some aspects of science or physics can be tough \u2013 chemistry .\nBut this is not tough , \u201d Kerry told an audience of school children in Indonesia in 2014 , when he was secretary of state .\n\u201c This is simple .\nKids at the earliest age can understand this.\n\u201d The science was \u201c absolutely certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me give you an example .\nWhen an apple separates from a tree , it falls to the ground.\n\u201d Contrast Kerry \u2019 s simplistic analogy with this statement in the IPCC \u2019 s third assessment report : \u201c The climate system is a coupled non-linear chaotic system , and therefore the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible , \u201d the IPCC said in 2001 , before it became deeply politicized as it is now .\nThere is , however , one area where Kerry and Putin are likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , at a business conference in Moscow , the Russian president denounced fracking as \u201c barbaric , \u201d claiming that fracking technologies \u201c destroy the environment.\n\u201d A January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment on Russian activities in U.S. elections noted that RT , the Russian state-owned news channel , ran anti-fracking programming that highlighted the alleged environmental and public health harms of the practice .\n\u201c This is likely reflective of the Russian Government \u2019 s concern about the impact of fracking and US natural gas production on the global energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s [ the Russian state-owned energy company ] profitability , \u201d the assessment concluded .\nIn June 2014 , Kerry \u2019 s predecessor as secretary of state complained about the impact of Russian money on financing \u201c astroturf \u201d environmental campaigns .\n\u201c We were up against Russia pushing oligarchs and others to buy media .\nWe were even up against phony environmental groups , and I \u2019 m a big environmentalist , but these were funded by the Russians to

.\nPutin understands the importance of energy as an essential component of American strategic power .\nJohn Kerry does not .\nThat is why , to borrow from Lenin , Kerry acts as Putin \u2019 s useful

from the system , a move which is expected to shake the Russian economy .\nAnother huge change involves defense spending .\nPreviously , the SPD-led coalition had demurred from recommitting to the NATO funding benchmarks of spending 2 % of GDP on defense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment .\nIndeed , the coalition indicated it was highly unlikely to do so .\nRussia \u2019 s invasion changed that calculus .\nOn Sunday , Chancellor Sch\u00f6lz announced Germany would now commit to spending 2 % of GDP on defense , stating , that \u201c [ i ] t \u2019 s clear , we will need to invest a lot more in the security of our country to defend our freedom and our democracy.\n\u201d The chancellor will include a \u20ac100 billion special defense fund in the 2022 budget to help attain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash is likely to procure , among other things , a replacement for Germany \u2019 s Tornado fleet , which serves as the country \u2019 s dual-nuclear capable aircraft .\nAmerican F-35s are a viable candidate for that acquisition .\nThe SPD had been lukewarm on the idea of procuring new dual-capable aircraft to help maintain a key alliance capability .\nYet another sacred cow seems to have fallen .\nIn his speech to the Bundestag on Sunday , Chancellor Sch\u00f6lz explained these policy changes : \u201c This is a major national undertaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting-edge , progressive Bundeswehr that can be relied upon to protect us.\n\u201d Germany has also chosen to bolster its military presence in Lithuania as part of NATO \u2019 s Enhanced Forward Presence there .\nAdditionally , it has offered to contribute to a similar unit in Slovakia and is playing a major role in air-policing missions over the Baltic and Black Sea regions .\nThe final taboo to fall was Germany \u2019 s insistence that it would not supply Ukraine with lethal aid .\nOn Saturday , Politico reported that Germany would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stinger anti-aircraft defense systems to Ukraine .\nThe government has also authorized the Netherlands to send Ukraine 400 rocket-propelled grenade launchers and told Estonia it could ship over nine howitzers.\n\u201d Germany had previously blocked the shipment of the German-origin howitzers to Ukraine .\nFor Germany , making any one of the policy changes mentioned above would be considered incredibly significant .\nFor the government to take them all , in quick succession , is nothing less than a political sea change .\nMany of these decisions remain to be implemented , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remain in the details .\nIt \u2019 s critical that Germany follow through on these commitments .\nStill , the message is stark .\nRussia has awakened Germany from its slumber .\nBerlin is finally taking steps to assume a role within NATO commensurate with its economic and political clout .\nLast Thursday , German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stated : \u201c We woke up in a different world today.\n\u201d The shock she and all of Germany felt was

Russian tanks started rolling across Ukraine .\nIn fact , before those tanks were even idling on the border , President Biden signed a series of executive orders that prioritized addressing climate change across all levels of government and halted all new oil and natural gas leases on public lands .\nThe order came in January of 2021 after he canceled construction permits for the Keystone XL Pipeline on his first day in office .\nAnd , he said , it was meant \u201c to make it official that climate change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national security and foreign policy.\n\u201d A land war in Europe now calls into question the prudence of limiting U.S. domestic energy production as the U.S. bans Russian oil imports and must now go abroad in search of new supply .\nBiden knows as much , and the president went on the defensive Tuesday morning , seeking to blunt criticism recently sharpened by climbing gas .\nHe blamed Russia for starting a war .\nThen he blamed American energy companies for sitting on the sidelines of an international energy crisis .\n\u201c They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They could be drilling right now , yesterday , last week , last year , \u201d the president told reporters .\n\u201c They are not using them for production now .\nThat \u2019 s their decision.\n\u201d And any criticism of his moves , he added , was out of bounds because \u201c it is simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production.\n\u201d For proof , Biden pointed to the fact that producers \u201c pumped more oil \u201d during his first year in office than \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The oil and gas lobby in Washington has heard all these arguments already .\nThe talking points are well-worn by now , and in recent weeks , White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki has even started to direct questions to that lobby .\nIs there anything the White House can do to boost domestic production , a reporter asked .\n\u201c I \u2019 d encourage you to ask them that question , \u201d Psaki replied , after scolding private business for not making the most of their drilling leases on public land .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House either doesn \u2019 t understand how drilling works , or worse , they are being misleading .\nAt least , so says Mike Sommers , chief executive officer of the American Petroleum Institute .\nHis industry is making the most of leased land , more so than at any time in the past , Sommers told Bloomberg News on Monday ; they will continue to boost production to meet surging demand .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a fundamental misunderstanding of the administration as to how the process actually works , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the industry has left resources untapped .\nIt takes more time than the administration is letting on , he added , because with a lease \u201c there has to be a lot of development that occurs between the leasing and then ultimately permitting for that acreage to be productive.\n\u201d As he sees it , the administration is \u201c purposefully misusing the facts here to advantage their position.\n\u201d One thing that all parties can agree on ?\nPrices are already high , and they are about to get worse .\nBefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a regular gallon of gas hit a new record of $ 4.17 , surpassing the previous high of $ 4.11 .\nAccording to AAA , that is a 72-cent increase from just a month ago and a $ 1.40 increase since last year .\nAmerican consumers seem prepared to stomach that increase , at least for a little while .\nAccording to new polling from Reuters/Ipsos , 80 % of Americans believe that the U.S. shouldn \u2019 t buy oil from Russia .\nBut Republicans note that prices were already climbing before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest White House claim that \u201c this is a Putin spike at the gas pump.\n\u201d \u201c Biden denies he had anything to do with it , \u201d said Sen.

Ro Khanna asked Chevron CEO Michael Wirth if he was \u201c embarrassed as an American company that your production is going up while European counterparts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not , in fact , embarrassed .\nIf anything , five months later , the Biden administration would like oil companies to pump more oil on the public lands and waters that they have leased already .\nThe president is not , however , abandoning his climate goals of an economy \u201c run on electric vehicles powered by clean energy.\n\u201d The pain at the pump that consumers now feel acutely , he said , \u201c should motivate us to accelerate a transition to clean energy.\n\u201d Until that future arrives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a message for the American people about gas prices , reporters asked after Air Force One touched down in Texas .\n\u201c They \u2019 re going to go up , \u201d Biden replied .\nWhat can you do about it , the reporters pressed .\n\u201c Can \u2019 t do much right now , \u201d he said

State of the Union Address on Tuesday , President Joe Biden promoted electric vehicles ( EVs ) , trumpeting his plans to establish \u201c a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations.\n\u201d In so doing , Biden is unwittingly supporting the worst humanitarian abuses in the world .\nThis is because of the way in which the materials used in manufacturing the batteries that power today \u2019 s EVs are obtained .\nTo obtain a reasonable amount of power per pound of battery weight , EV manufacturers generally use various forms of lithium-ion ( Li-ion ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s positive electrode , called the cathode , is largely made up of the highly reactive metal lithium ( Li ) .\nTo keep the cathode stable when a battery is not in use , the lithium is combined in a metal oxide matrix , with different manufacturers using different combinations of metals .\nMost EV manufacturers combine lithium with nickel , cobalt and manganese to create a Li-Ni-Mn-Co oxide matrix to form the cathode .\nTesla substitutes aluminum ( Al ) for the manganese , yielding a Li-Ni-Co-Al oxide matrix for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintains that their formulae is more cost-effective as less cobalt is required .\nIn all cases , the negative electrode , called the anode , in an EV battery is composed mostly of graphite .\nTo support the huge EV expansion being promoted by Biden , we will need immense quantities of the materials needed to manufacture EV batteries , for example , lithium , cobalt , graphite , nickel , manganese and aluminum .\nLet \u2019 s consider the sources of just three of these substances\u2014lithium , cobalt and graphite\u2014to see where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a normal 1,000-pound Li-ion EV battery , there is about 25 pounds of lithium .\nSince lithium brines typically contain less than 0.1 % lithium , about 25,000 pounds of brines are needed to get the 25 pounds of pure lithium .\nThis is mainly extracted from Tibet and the highlands of Argentina-Bolivia-Chile ( according to the U.S. Geological Survey , 58 % of the world \u2019 s lithium reserves are found in Chile ) known as the \u201c lithium triangle.\n\u201d Lithium production in Tibet results in dead , toxic fish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the Liqi River .\nThe Ganzizhou Rongda Li mine in Tibet has thoroughly poisoned this river .\nSimilarly , native peoples in the lithium triangle

in one of the driest desert regions in the world to pump out brines from drilled wells .\nSome estimates show that approximately 1.9 million litres of water is needed to produce a tonne of lithium

area where some communities already must get water driven in from elsewhere.\n\u201d A 1,000-pound Li-ion EV battery typically also contains about 30 pounds of cobalt .\nCobalt ore grades average about 0.1 % , so we need to process almost 30,000 pounds of ore to get 30 pounds of cobalt .\nWith 50 % of the world \u2019 s cobalt reserves , the Democratic Republic of Congo contributes almost two-thirds of global cobalt production .\nThis is causing immense humanitarian abuses .\nCongo has at least 40,000 children\u2014some as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for less than $ 2 a day .\nThey are exposed to

, starting with Vladimir Putin \u2019 s blatant lies that he is not making war on the country .\nThe Ukrainians \u2019 heroic resistance has changed the conversation about declining enthusiasm for democracy , and Western allies have gone from chronic disunity to concerted resolve .\nFor the first time in its 72-year history , NATO mobilized its rapid response force .\nSomething else has also been upended : the scale and effects of propaganda .\nAnd here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter a new era of international tension that will have grave consequences for the future of democracy around the world .\nThe idea of institutionalized propaganda has a shorter history than baseball or the typewriter ; the latter was invented in the mid-19th century .\nThe 1911 edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica had no entry for \u201c propaganda.\n\u201d The Great War changed this .\nThe editors concluded that censorship , war bias , and the \u201c perversion of fact \u201d during that conflict had \u201c cut a Grand Canyon gash in the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a supplement they felt obliged to publish , \u201c propaganda \u201d ran nearly ten pages of small , densely-packed type .\nIn the decades since , propaganda has been a systematic , pervasive feature of modern government , in both war and peacetime .\nBut in recent years , we have reached an inflexion point for a new series of changes .\nPropaganda was once a tool of warfare , like artillery and airplanes .\nNow it is a battlefield unto itself .\nThis change has crested with the Russian invasion and sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war is over .\nFirst is the alienation of time , place , and accountability .\nThe infamous \u201c Great Moon Hoax , \u201d originating in the New York Sun in 1835 , reached Europe months later .\nThanks to the Internet and social media , a fake news item now can span the entire planet in the time it takes to hit \u201c send.\n\u201d Not only does this make the Internet such a potent propaganda weapon , it \u2019 s incredibly cost-effective .\nTanks and bombers are expensive .\nComputers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use perniciously .\nThey allow for automation through the use of bots \u2013 short for robotic software programs .\nIn the case of the moon hoax , the culprit \u2013 the New York Sun \u2013 was obvious .\nRussian web brigades , as its bot units are called , have the ability to cloak their attacks even as they \u201c flood the zone.\n\u201d A RAND report in 2016 called Russia \u2019 s approach the \u201c firehose of falsehood \u201d model .\nUkrainian security services believe that a Russian bot farm has created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war , but it is hard to know for certain \u2013 which is precisely the point .\nA second set of changes lies in propagandists \u2019 relationship to truth .\nIn the case of this war against Ukraine , Putin has unflinchingly pushed a narrative that is , on its face , preposterous .\nHe says repeatedly that Ukraine , a functioning democracy with a Jewish president , is a neo-Nazi state .\nUp until the moment the Russian troops crossed into Ukraine , he claimed they had no war intentions .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a \u201c special military operation.\n\u201d His ambassador in the United Nations categorially denied that civilians were targeted even as television footage showed bombed-out hospitals and apartment buildings .\nMany Russians believe Putin , even when their relatives in Ukraine phone with horrors stories of what is happening to them .\nWe might take some solace from the fact that Russian propaganda seems not to be affecting most countries , though the influence on places like India and China is unclear .\nEven the most pro-Putin politicians in the United States seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misunderstands a fundamental aspect of what is taking place and what is so dangerous about the Russian approach .\nIn the past , the aim of the propagandist was to get people to reach a certain specific conclusion .\nThe most effective propaganda was attached to some facts , as that enhanced the plausibility of the message .\nThe approach was to reduce cynicism about the propagandists and build confidence in their messages and social coherence .\nNow the end goal is to sow corrosive cynicism and confusion .\nThis is particularly pernicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a direct attack on democracy , which depends on public confidence to succeed .\nA prime example is Russia \u2019 s attempt to undermine the 2016 election , not to pick a winner but to pit voters against each other on the basis of race , gender , and ideology in an attempt to erode Americans \u2019 faith in the validity of the system .\nRussia \u2019 s behavior in Ukraine and elsewhere in recent years should be a wakeup call with regard to the dangers of propaganda .\nHere are five steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , we need to recognize that combatting propaganda is a priority .\nThe Annual Threat Assessment by the U.S. Intelligence Community , released last Tuesday , observed that new technologies \u201c are disrupting longstanding systems and societal dynamics , forcing individuals , communities , and governments to adjust and find new ways of living , working , and managing.\n\u201d But the report does not go nearly far enough , focusing almost exclusively on military operations .\nSecond , muckraking journalists used to say that the best cure for bad publicity by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the lies .\nSimilarly , the best antidote for bad propaganda is good counter-propaganda that sticks to facts .\nThe Biden administration \u2019 s transparency before the Russian invasion exemplified this approach .\nThird is the matter of supporting independent media , which is crucial for the provision of verifiable information .\nThere has been a heartening outpouring of private assistance for independent media in Ukraine , but public funding is essential to achieve the scale necessary .\nOn the U.S. side , outlets like RFE/RL need to maintain their approach of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to weaponize those stations and make them propaganda vehicles , as some have done .\nFourth , social media platforms need to create greater capacity to respond to , and enforce , their terms of service , which would mean changing how they adjudicate content on their platforms .\nAnd there needs to be a broader discussion about profiting from propaganda .\nWhy did it take a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 for platforms to stop recommending the Kremlin-friendly Russia Today and allowing it to receive advertising revenue ?\nWhy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough ?\nFifth , individuals need better tools to be able to discern potential propaganda .\nOne crucial aspect in this and other recent wars is the use of fake or repurposed videos and images purportedly showing the conflict .\nPlatforms like TikTok have algorithms that often circulate inauthentic videos to millions of people from accounts newly created or repurposed to profit from war .\nWhile rethinking algorithms is one important aspect , another is to enable simpler authentication of images , including easier reverse-image searches .\nSince World War I , propaganda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that does not mean we can not find better ways to dig ourselves out of the mess it creates .\nJohn Maxwell Hamilton is a global fellow with the Wilson Center , serves on the faculty for Louisiana State

energy policies of the EU ?\nCertainly there is plenty of blame to go around , but the reality is that all of this started in October of 2020 .\nBack then , Trump and Biden were going head to head in debates leading up to the November election .\nBiden famously stated \u201c I would transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement was a clear signal to energy producers in this country that Biden \u2019 s eventual ascent to the presidency would bring unprecedented uncertainty for at least the next four years .\nNever willing to let a crisis go to waste , the Biden administration went straight to work

by the pandemic to massively curtail energy production not in the distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though oil production has rebounded to some extent from the demand-driven crash in 2020 , refining and drilling are still well below pre-pandemic levels .\nThe regulatory uncertainty imposed on traditional energy production is simply too great .\nBiden can complain that these companies aren \u2019 t throwing money away to save his poll numbers , but a lifetime politician like him is in no place to criticize those who provide essential goods and services to the American public .\nBiden \u2019 s insistence that his policies have no role in the pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaf ears .\nSo just how severe is this pain ?\nCarl Quintanilla of CNBC \u2019 s \u201c Squawk on the Street \u201d shared this graph in a tweet on March 8th in an apparent attempt to put a damper on concerns about gasoline prices .\nQuintanilla states that the graph represents \u201c gasoline costs , as consumer \u2019 s share of wallet \u201d but that \u2019 s not entirely correct .\nFor one , the graph clearly states that it takes account of other energy products and that it is computed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d His intended point is obvious enough : Americans shouldn \u2019 t complain about high gas prices because , as a share of total spending , gasoline is very low by historical standards .\nQuintanilla \u2019 s comment sounds like the author of the graph added up all the money spent on the various things we buy and compared the dollars spent on fuel to the total .\nThat \u2019 s not the case .\nA much better representation of the impact on Americans \u2019 wallets would include information about the astronomical inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products Americans buy .\nIt would also have a concrete measure of the \u201c wallet \u201d Quintanilla mentions .\nThe graph below uses data on average production and non-supervisory hourly wages over the past ten years as a baseline gross monthly income .\nThe most recent data available indicates that the average wage for such workers is $ 26.94 per hour .\nI assumed that the household drove about 250 miles a week in a car with 20 miles per gallon average fuel efficiency .\nThe blue line shows monthly gasoline expense based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasoline prices .\nSo without regard to income and other expenses Americans have to cover , we are paying about the same now as we were during the high gas price era of Obama \u2019 s second term : just under $ 200 per month .\nBut what about the total household budget ?\nHaven \u2019 t wages risen over the past ten years , making the increased expense less onerous ?\nProduction and non-supervisory wages have risen steadily from 2012 to 2022 to the tune of about 3.75 % per year .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ monthly income , we get the red line .\nDuring the Trump administration , gasoline as a share of income was right around 3.25 % of the budget , according to my simple calculations .\nIn 2021 , it began to rise again and currently sits as high as it has been for the past 6 years .\nThose who are sympathetic to Quintanilla \u2019 s point might say that we have validated the graph in his tweet , that American \u2019 s aren \u2019 t as bad off as many claim .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of nearly everything else in Americans \u2019 household budgets .\nStarting in mid-2021 , prices of staple goods began to skyrocket .\nThe most recent report shows that , compared to this time last year , food and beverage prices rose 7.6 % , durable goods prices ( such as appliances and cars ) rose 18.7 % , and overall energy prices rose 25.6 % .\nInflation is too much money chasing too few goods .\nWhile the Federal Reserve contemplates decreases in the money supply to deal with the money component @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaos continues to restrict our ability to produce the things Americans need .\nBlaming inflation on the Ukraine-Russia conflict , which is also partly his fault , does nothing to alleviate the stranglehold Biden has

suppositions underpinning its conclusion that new investment in fossil-fuel production is unnecessary have proved wrong , and the IEA \u2019 s failure to square up to the intermittency problem of

acting to further Western interests , the IEA now behaves as the world \u2019 s principal renewable energy lobbyist .\nLater this month , Secretary Granholm chairs the 2022 IEA ministerial meeting in

now .\nToday , most of the so-called elite media openly commingle news and opinion and actively suppress or distort stories that don \u2019 t fit their shared narrative .\nIn this fashion they dismissed the Hunter Biden laptop scandal as \u201c Russian disinformation ; \u201d they ignored or demeaned stories and individuals linking the coronavirus to the Wuhan lab ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie of

a group of radically liberal billionaires and millionaires .\nThey have attacked our system of justice at its roots , bankrolling the campaigns of activist district attorney candidates who promise to give criminals soft sentences in the name of so-called social justice and equity .\nNow self-styled progressive district attorneys , many of whom toppled conventional Democratic opponents across the country by running to their left , are enforcing their own warped sense of social justice instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime has risen in our cities \u2013 the Council on Criminal Justice found that in 2021

.\nSteve Descano fought to lower his sentence and returned him to the streets .\nThose murders shouldn \u2019 t have happened .\nThe \u201c criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tragedy is a danger to the public .\nIn an effort to make our cities and suburbs more secure , we need district attorneys who will follow the law instead of giving criminals a slap on the wrist .\nArbitrary and inconsistent enforcement creates the dangerous precedent that there are no consequences for breaking the law .\nThe great irony is that the vast majority of the liberal elites bank-rolling this soft-on-crime agenda live in wealthy , gated neighborhoods and will never experience the consequences of their advocacy .\nThe victims of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working class , and the marginalized .\nAs a former city

"Commentary: The Biden Laptop Story and Why We Must Amend Section 230", "content": "Last week , the New York Times finally acknowledged that the New York Post \u2019 s October 2020 story about Hunter Biden \u2019 s laptop was real .\nWhen the story broke in the Post in the days leading up to the 2020 presidential election , it was widely dismissed as \u201c Russian disinformation , \u201d with social media platforms moving swiftly to restrict sharing of it .\nThe restrictions significantly reduced visibility of the story , and a year and a half later , the platforms have still not offered a full accounting of how they decided to suppress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social platform transparency .\nJust two weeks before the presidential election in 2020 , the New York Post announced a journalistic bombshell : A laptop belonging to the Democratic candidate \u2019 s son and containing a wealth of compromising emails , letters , images , and videos had been abandoned at a computer repair store .\nOf particular relevance to the election were emails allegedly suggestive of questionable business arrangements with foreign nations and allegations of facilitations of access involving Joe Biden , who was vice president when the messages were written .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ story as they did for John Podesta \u2019 s emails and the infamous Steele dossier , mainstream media outlets largely ignored the Biden story .\nWhen they did cover it , their treatment usually resembled that of Politico , which titled an article : \u201c Hunter Biden story is Russian disinfo , dozens of former intel officials say.\n\u201d An article in Poynter even cited the lack of mainstream media coverage as an indicator of the report \u2019 s lack of credibility .\nPoynter also emphasized that social media platforms were moving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , without waiting for a verdict from fact checkers or news outlets .\nIn Poynter \u2019 s view , these actions carried unique weight : \u201c When these organizations apply their misinformation rules , that should be a red flag alerting you to give something another look.\n\u201d This raises perhaps the most important question : How did social media platforms decide to suppress the Post story until after the election ?\nWhat was the evidence they used to determine that the story was likely false ?\nAt the time , Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was false and that the need to \u201c reduce the spread of misinformation \u201d meant that it could not wait until fact checkers had a chance to vet the story .\nThe company has never explained what those signals were .\nTwitter cited an ever-changing litany of policies in explaining its ban , suggesting a company that decided first to ban the article and then hunted for a rationale to justify its action .\nAsked whether the Biden campaign had reached out to them prior to the restrictions , the social media firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of the Times recent acknowledgment of the story \u2019 s accuracy , they would be changing their criteria for restricting the sharing of political stories , the social media firms remained silent .\nNor did they respond when asked whether they felt any responsibility for suppressing what has now been verified as accurate reporting .\nWe will likely never know what \u201c signals \u201d Facebook relied on or who at Twitter decided the article shouldn \u2019 t be shared .\nAcross the world , social media platforms are ramping up their interventions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during large-scale protests in India , the Modi government pressured Twitter into blocking and hiding hundreds of accounts critical of the government .\nIn Pakistan in 2018 , Facebook instructed its moderators to apply special scrutiny to one political party , while treating an opposing party as \u201c benign.\n\u201d In Myanmar , Facebook \u2019 s guidelines permitted praise of an extremist organization that used the platform to incite violence against Muslims \u2013 even as it publicly touted a ban on such praise .\nFacebook \u2019 s list of banned \u201c hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both the European Union parliament and the governments of major European countries .\nAll of this happens in the shadows .\nThe social media platforms that increasingly act as our digital public squares invisibly curate and cultivate the political discourse and information environment to promote the views with which they agree and silence those that they oppose .\nAs the New York Post saga reminds us , this curation extends even to journalism with relevance to an American presidential election .\nUnless they are held accountable , the platforms will never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their mistakes , or improve their practices .\nAs the 2022 midterms approach in an increasingly divided nation and dangerous world , these challenges are ever more pressing .\nChange is needed .\nIt is time to amend Section 230 of the Telecommunications Act to force transparency on the social media platforms that now wield so much influence \u2013 and control \u2013 over our public discourse .\n__________ RealClear Media Fellow Kalev Leetaru is a senior fellow at the George Washington University Center for

, The Walt Disney Company is taking wokeness to a whole new level , threatening millions of children with political propaganda .\nFirst , there was Disney CEO Bob Chapek criticizing Florida Gov .\nRon DeSantis over HB 1557 , which reaffirms parental rights in education and prevents educators from injecting personal political views into early childhood learning .\n( And , yes , you can still \u201c say gay \u201d in Florida . )\nThen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s diversity and inclusion manager , promoting transgenderism and pansexuality in Disney content .\nThe entertainment company is now removing all mentions of traditional gender roles \u2013 boys and girls , men and women \u2013 at theme parks .\nWhile Disney \u2019 s wokeness is hardly new and unfortunately not surprising , the company \u2019 s resonance among America \u2019 s youth makes it deeply disturbing nonetheless .\nUnlike many other woke companies , Disney reaches tens of millions of U.S. children .\nHalf of American homes with kids under 10 years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disney hopes to increase its global paid subscriptions to 350 million by 2024 .\nThe content that Disney creates today will indoctrinate young consumers tomorrow .\nIt will shape their hearts and minds , insidiously molding children to embrace liberal politics with subtle and not-so-subtle messaging .\nWokeness will be passed on to future generations .\nAnd it may become more radical over time .\nHowever , there is a bright side .\nThe bright side is people \u2013 individual consumers making their own decisions .\nPeople will eventually recognize Disney for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company \u2019 s blatant propaganda .\nFringe concepts like transgenderism and pansexuality may be important to left-wing consumers , but they are not priorities for the overwhelming majority of American customers .\nDisney is shrinking its market share \u2013 perhaps unknowingly and perhaps not yet , but the company \u2019 s audience will shrink .\nWe \u2019 re seeing the early signs already \u2013 even at Walt Disney World .\nAccording to Jose Castillo , a current Walt Disney employee who is running for Congress in Florida , a \u201c silent majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those staffers reject woke politics .\nWhile it \u2019 s troubling that they are forced to be \u201c silent \u201d in the first place , many Disney employees oppose the political agenda of Chapek and other executives .\nThere \u2019 s a reason why Gov .\nDeSantis is now targeting Disney \u2019 s special privileges in Florida , a state where registered Republican voters outnumber Democrats by 100,000 for the first time ever .\nThere is a popular mandate for anti-woke politics , especially when children \u2019 s futures are at stake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida has seen a net gain of more than 363,000 voters .\nThat \u2019 s no small feat .\nI \u2019 ve seen the popular mandate in person .\nMy organization , Freedom Key Society , recently hosted a \u201c Freedom Fight Night \u201d in Miami , bringing together Ultimate Fighting Championship legends like Frank Mir and Tito Ortiz to celebrate American freedom .\nThe event was a resounding success , mobilizing grassroots support in Florida that even

just want quality content to keep their children occupied .\nFor that same reason , the Daily Wire is pouring $ 100 million into children \u2019 s content that can rival Disney .\nWhether or not the venture is successful , conservative commentators like Ben Shapiro recognize the anti-woke mandate .\nThey recognize that nearly two-thirds of Americans ( including most Democrats ) support bills like HB 1557 over Disney \u2019 s partisan talking points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate wokeness has gone too far , companies like Disney are inevitably swimming against the tide .\nMark my words : Wokeness will lose \u2013 maybe not this month or a year from now , but the numbers don \u2019 t lie .\nThere is simply too much popular consensus working in our favor .\nMost Americans don \u2019 t want a trans Cinderella .\nMost Americans don \u2019 t care for a pansexual Lion King .\nThey just want Cinderella and the Lion King \u2013 full stop .\n__________ Harrison Rogers is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a serial

National Committee have not been idle , but responded on behalf of voters to ensure that free , fair , and transparent elections remain a hallmark of American democracy .\nJoe Biden and Democrats predictably have done everything under the sun to smear these efforts , even calling those everyday Americans who oppose the efforts racist .\nBut now , over a year later , the results are in , and Democrats have been totally wrong .\nGeorgia and Texas are perfect examples .\nAlmost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SB 202 \u2013 a highly popular Republican-led election integrity law which expanded early voting , poll watching , and voter ID requirements \u2013 Democrats pulled out all the stops and started lying .\nThey said the law was \u201c racist , \u201d would \u201c suppress \u201d voter turnout , and even backed a boycott meant to hurt small businesses , many of them black-owned .\nEssentially , they shamefully tried to stir up chaos along racial lines .\nBut on Election Day , the Atlanta

Democrat politicians to stop their lies and admit their claims aren \u2019 t based in reality .\nTexas is further proof of Democrats \u2019 lies .\nIn the first wave of major elections since its popular election integrity law Senate Bill 1 was enacted ( containing a number of similar provisions to the Georgia bill ) , the state saw the highest voter turnout ever .\nIn fact , turnout increased from 2.56 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in 2020 .\nThe rollout of Republican election integrity efforts in both Georgia and Texas not only disproves Democrats \u2019 lie that Republican-led election integrity measures \u201c suppress \u201d voters , but also shows just how far left the Democrat rhetoric has deviated from the facts .\nPerhaps they are afraid of the results ?\nIn hindsight , Democrats \u2019 dubbing of anyone who opposed their anti-election integrity efforts as \u201c racist \u201d hasn \u2019 t aged well .\nTake voter ID laws , for instance .\nBefore the Georgia bill was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including 69 % of black voters and 60 % of Democrats \u2013 supported voter ID .\nRegardless , Democrats wore themselves ragged pushing the broader claim that Republicans were enacting \u201c voter suppression , \u201d even going so far as to try to eviscerate the Senate filibuster to push through their radical federal election takeover agenda .\nBut support for voter ID laws only rose , up at least 13 percentage points among black Americans .\nAdditionally , voter turnout in Atlanta \u2013 ones with predominately black communities \u2013 shot up 17 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 2018 and 2020 .\nThe truth is , Republican efforts to fortify election integrity have only empowered the black community .\nAs Democrats continue to ruin our election systems , even trying to allow noncitizens to vote ,

general counsel Jennifer Abruzzo declared war on \u201c captive audience \u201d meetings , essentially preventing employers from discussing unions with their employees .\nThis statement came one day after President Joe Biden chided Amazon , saying , \u201c Amazon here we come .\nWatch .\nWatch.\n\u201d Union leaders and their political supporters are the first to say that profits blind employers to their workers \u2019 needs .\nBut unions need dues-paying members just as much as employers need profits .\nAnd with membership rates in freefall , unions are using every trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joining .\nWorkers deserve protection from dues-driven unions at least as much as they need protection from their employers .\nSenator Tim Scott recently introduced a bill to ensure that the true voice of workers is heard : the Employee Rights Act .\nThe ERA would bring American labor law into the 21st century .\nUnions had real purpose generations ago when dangerous conditions , unsafe hours , and child labor were common .\nBut that \u2019 s not the case today .\nMost businesses understand the importance of protecting worker health and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight labor market ; and a plethora of federal and state government agencies work to protect employees against businesses that cut corners in those areas .\nSamuel Gompers , the first president of the American Federation of Labor , warned that unions must lead based on \u201c the solidarity of the working men themselves through the economic forces of their trade unions \u201d rather than on \u201c legal enactment.\n\u201d He considered reliance on legislation as equivalent to unions \u201c admitting our incompetency \u201d and \u201c our inability to seek better conditions.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 warning has come to fruition as workers increasingly question the relevancy of unions .\nUnion membership for private-sector workers has plummeted in recent years , from 20.1 % when the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking membership in 1983 to a historic low of just 6.1 % in 2021 .\nAttempts in recent years to unionize factories at Volkswagen , Boeing , Nissan , and Amazon have all failed .\nAs a result , today \u2019 s unions have little choice but to coerce membership through government fiat , regardless of employee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the 2020 election cycle \u2013 often opposing candidates their members support .\nIn turn , Big Labor \u2019 s friends in Washington have worked to pass the deceptively named Protecting the Right to Organize Act .\nThe PRO Act would eliminate right-to-work laws that let workers refrain from joining a union if they so choose .\nIt effectively eliminates the right to a secret ballot in union elections , permitting unions to use employee signatures on an authorization card as a basis for claiming to represent these workers .\nAn obvious risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signing such cards \u2013 especially since the PRO Act would also compel employers to share their employees \u2019 personal information with the union .\nDo these sound like policies aimed at protecting workers ?\nBy contrast , the ERA would restore the voice of workers who want unions to be accountable to them .\nIt guarantees the right of workers to secret-ballot elections .\nIt requires that union members opt in before their dues can be used for political causes and allows them to opt out of sharing personal information with unions .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers opposed to the union , and it criminalizes threatening behavior .\nThe bill would also protect the independence of gig workers by letting businesses provide them with benefits without changing their legal status as independent contractors .\nPerhaps most important , the ERA would protect small-franchise businesses .\nAs CEO of CKE Restaurants , I understood that owning a franchise was the only way many young entrepreneurs could get their foot in the door of prosperity .\nA franchise relationship allows franchise owners to focus on the success of their business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBy contract , franchisers have no control over franchisees \u2019 employment practices .\nBut unions are so desperate for membership that they want to treat all franchisees of particular brands as a single employer because they believe that this would make unionization easier .\nIt probably wouldn \u2019 t \u2013 but it would destroy the franchise business model .\nThe ERA would protect franchise owners by clarifying what is obvious to everyone \u2013 that franchisees act as employers of their own employees .\nOf course , workers can unionize if they wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stores actually managed by individual franchisees , which is standard labor law .\nThe ERA \u2019 s policies are wildly popular .\nRecent polling shows that 70 % of those polled \u2013 including 76 % of individuals in union households \u2013 believe that workers should have the right to a secret ballot .\nOther major provisions \u2013 including the right to withhold dues from political spending , privacy protections , and the criminalization of union threats \u2013 poll at an average favorability of 70 % .\nThe Employee Rights Act is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions more accountable to their members \u2013 which could actually help them .\nIf they oppose the bill , union leaders and their Democratic allies will tell us all we need to know about how much the labor movement cares about workers .\n__________ Andy Puzder is the former CEO of CKE Restaurants , chairman of the board of 2ndVote Advisers , a senior fellow at Pepperdine University \u2019 s

Politics", "content": "One of the many conclusions from the pandemic is politics and bureaucratic incompetence , not science , drives decision-making at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) .\nThe CDC \u2019 s problems are new to many but not to me .\nIn 2014 , I wrote about the CDC \u2019 s mishandling of an Ebola outbreak in Africa and lab accidents with pathogens including anthrax and the H5N1 influenza virus .\nLike most things in life , bad practices turn worse if not corrected .\nThe CDC \u2019 s recent decision to kick public health to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance President Biden \u2019 s open border policy is evidence the organization \u2019 s decision-making is rooted in politics not science .\nOn April 1 , the CDC announced it is terminating Title 42 which gives the federal government the right to stop the flow of migrants into the U.S. on public health grounds .\nThe original order to stop migrants was issued under the Trump administration on March 20 , 2020 and the termination date of the order will be effective on May 23 .\nThe CDC justified its action on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. population lives in a county identified as having \u2018 low \u2019 COVID-19 Community Level\u2026.\n\u201d The fact the COVID-19 rate is low is fantastic but the goal should be to keep it that way and not advance policies that can distribute SARS-Co-V2 around the country .\nWhen dealing with a highly mutating virus , calling off restrictions is taking an early victory lap which is risky for an organization whose focus is to reduce transmission of infectious diseases .\nThe virus is endemic and the mutations keep coming .\nIn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats , led by Senator Joe Manchin , D-W.Va. , are urging the CDC to keep Title 42 over concerns of the virus .\nIn a letter to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky , Manchin urged her to extend the Title 42 policy because of rising COVID-19 cases coupled with the record number of migrant encounters at the southern border .\nIn context , the decision to terminate Title 42 isn \u2019 t surprising because the Biden administration never fully implemented it .\nHundreds of thousands of migrants were allowed to enter the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the country even though they were infected .\nJessica Vaughn , Director of Policy Studies with the Center for Immigration Studies , told me , \u201c Under the Biden administration , roughly half of the illegal border crossers encountered by the Border Patrol have been expelled under Title 42 , mostly single adults , and about half have been allowed to enter ; those coming in are mostly families and unaccompanied minors.\n\u201d Vaughn added that government reports show some migrants had COVID-19 and were not quarantined , and , more concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local public officials are not notified routinely when COVID-carrying people are transported into communities.\n\u201d Mask mandates are another example of the CDC playing politics .\nThe CDC issued an order on January 29 , 2021 that mandates face masks for individuals traveling on public transportation .\nThe order was blocked by a federal judge , but the Biden administration is going to challenge the decision with the backing of the CDC .\nPushing mask mandates is consistent with the Democrat political strategy of one-size-fits-all .\nThe problem for the CDC is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the population level for a variety of reasons , including user error and wearing coverings that just don \u2019 t work .\nRecall , at the beginning of the pandemic , Dr. Anthony Fauci described the limitations of masks but subsequently changed his tune .\nThe science shows individuals can protect themselves from SARS-Co-V2 if they properly wear N95 and KN95 masks , but cloth masks are essentially useless .\nHowever , the CDC \u2019 s mask mandate defines a mask as essentially anything you can throw over your nose and mouth by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering the nose and mouth of the wearer , excluding face shields.\n\u201d Not very scientific , I might add .\nBiden \u2019 s desire to end Title 42 was just blocked by a federal judge , but regardless of the legal outcome , the CDC followed the president and not the science .\nThe decisions on Title 42 and mask mandates expose the CDC \u2019 s \u201c science \u201d hypocrisy : on the one hand , migrants do not pose a health problem for spreading infections but on the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop viral transmission .\nIronically , the political nature of the CDC makes it a risk to public health

"Commentary: Despite Rising Crime, Nation\u2019s Capital Is at Forefront of Cities Pushing Leniency", "content": "WASHINGTON , D.C. \u2014 \u201c But she told me she was 16 years old.\n\u201d Under a new criminal code being considered by the District of Columbia city council , that statement would be what is called \u201c an affirmative defense to liability \u201d for an adult who has sex with a minor .\nPut more plainly , an adult accused of sexual activity with a minor could avoid culpability if found to have \u201c reasonably \u201d believed the child \u2019 s claim at the time to have reached the age of consent .\nThis more lenient approach to child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes being considered by the council .\nA sweeping new criminal code would redefine what counts as a crime in the nation \u2019 s capital , how those accused of crimes are tried , and how those convicted are punished .\nAlthough many states are pushing back against progressive criminal justice reforms amid rising rates of violent crime , liberal jurisdictions from east to west continue to push for more lenient sentencing .\nWashington , D.C. , stands out for its softer approach in the face of a crime problem illustrated by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100,000 residents in 2019 , to 29 in 2020 , and then to 34 in 2021 .\nProponents say the changes are designed to reduce the number of people arrested , prosecuted , convicted , and incarcerated .\nAs it now stands , the District \u2019 s criminal code \u2018 \u2019 is out-of-sync with current public norms and best practices , \u201d according to Richard Schmechel , a prime mover of its reform effort .\nSchmechel , until recently executive director of the D.C. Criminal Code Reform Commission , said the new approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bias \u201d in the current system .\nBut critics warn that the changes now being considered will make it difficult to hold offenders responsible for crimes .\nThe proposed rewrite of the D.C. criminal code recommended by the reform commission , formed by the city council in 2016 , would affect how the nation \u2019 s capital treats everything from murder to indecent exposure , from robbery to panhandling .\nFor example , it eliminates \u201c accomplice liability for felony murder , \u201d the legal principle that holds conspirators responsible if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crime .\nCurrently , the wheelman waiting around the corner while his friend robs a bodega doesn \u2019 t have to pull a trigger or even be armed to be prosecuted for felony murder if the clerk is killed .\nChanges to felony murder laws have long been a goal of activists striving to limit prison populations .\n\u201c These laws impose sentences associated with murder on people who neither intended to kill nor anticipated a death , and even on those who did not participate in the killing , \u201d says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with The Sentencing Project , an anti-incarceration group active in the effort to rewrite the D.C. criminal code .\nPunishing a lookout for someone else \u2019 s violent act violates \u201c the principle of proportional sentencing , which is supposed to punish crimes based on their severity , \u201d Ghandnoosh says .\n\u201c These excessively punitive outcomes violate widely shared perceptions of justice.\n\u201d But Elana Suttenberg , special counsel at the U.S. attorney \u2019 s office for the District of Columbia , warns that the underlying concept of shared liability is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony prepared for the D.C. council , she noted that this is especially true when a group or gang is involved , especially if it is not clear which specific member was responsible for a killing .\nSuttenberg said the change could lead to the possibility that \u201c a gang rape perpetrated by two or more individuals that resulted in the victim \u2019 s death may result in no liability for murder , as it may not be possible to determine which defendant committed the lethal act.\n\u201d Or consider the law \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the District defines a riot as \u201c a public disturbance involving an assemblage of 5 or more persons which by tumultuous and violent conduct or the threat thereof creates grave danger of damage or injury to property or persons.\n\u201d Leniency shown during the 2020 George Floyd riots aside , those who organize or encourage a riot face stiff penalties under the current code : If anyone is hurt in the rioting , or if the riot causes more than $ 5,000 in property damage , \u201c every person who willfully incited or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than 10 years.\n\u201d The newly proposed code would drop the language about incitement altogether , a change that would make it harder for authorities to hold those who promote rioting responsible .\nThe new definition of \u201c rioting \u201d would require that police prove a long list of actions and occurrences before they are able to charge those involved in group violence .\nUnder the new code , a rioter is not just one who \u201c knowingly commits or attempts to commit a criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or damage to property , \u201d but who is also \u201c reckless as to the fact 7 or more other people are each personally and simultaneously committing or attempting to commit a criminal bodily injury , taking of property , or damage to property , in the area reasonably perceptible to the actor.\n\u201d To make an arrest for rioting , police will have to have evidence of not just what the person being cuffed has done , but what others in a crowd were doing as well .\nPolice would also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of what each of the others was doing .\nAll of this in the midst of street melees .\nThis new section can hardly be seen as empowering police to quell mob violence .\nAnd though relaxing statutes involving the sexual exploitation of minors may seem a strange goal , it is not outside the progressive mainstream , which calls for reduced sentences even in such cases .\nBoth in her work on the United States Sentencing Commission and as a federal D.C. circuit judge , newly seated Supreme Court Justice advocated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of possessing child pornography as well as violent offenders and drug dealers .\nEven when the new code retains old offenses , the punishments recommended would be reduced .\nOne of the key goals of those seeking to reduce prison populations has been to get rid of mandatory minimum sentences .\n\u201c It \u2019 s such a critical part of creating reform , \u201d says Ghandnoosh .\nCurrently , the mandatory minimum for those who commit premeditated first-degree murder is 30 years in prison .\nThe minimum punishment for \u201c committing a crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d is five years behind bars .\nIn the newly proposed code , there are no mandatory minimums at all .\nThere will , however , be new limits on the penalties judges will be able to hand out .\nThe longest sentence that could be given for first-degree murder under the new code is 45 years .\nSome reformers think that is too severe .\n\u201c We advocate a maximum of 20 years , \u201d Ghandnoosh tells RealClearInvestigations .\nStill , she says , it is \u201c notable to move away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a key goal of billionaire activist George Soros , whose Open Society Foundations has funded the Sentencing Project for over two decades .\nPerhaps the most consequential of the proposed reforms have to do with the minor-league offenses adjudicated at the courthouse : misdemeanors .\nThey may be minor crimes , but the changes to prosecuting misdemeanors would have a major effect on the prosecution of more serious crimes .\nCurrently in the District of Columbia , felony prosecutions are heard by juries ; a misdemeanor that goes to trial is , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge .\nThe commission recommends that misdemeanor defendants facing any possible incarceration be free to demand a jury trial .\n\u201c We respect the right to a jury in appropriate cases , \u201d says Suttenberg .\nBut can the D.C. court system handle the added workload ?\nAltogether , the eight courtrooms devoted to misdemeanors in the District hear somewhere between 110 and 170 cases a week ; by contrast , each of the courtrooms reserved for felony trials schedule only one case a day .\nThe D.C. Superior Court would soon be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find and empanel enough jurors and other time-consuming procedural requirements of jury trials .\n\u201c Creating new rights to demand a jury in misdemeanor cases will strain both court and prosecutorial resources , \u201d says Suttenberg .\nIf it is passed by the D.C. city council and signed by the mayor , the new code would provide a \u201c judicial sentence review \u201d for anyone who has served 15 years in prison .\nThese \u201c second-look provisions \u201d are a key goal of the Sentencing Project .\nBut others who have been part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are less enthusiastic about the \u201c decarceration \u201d that would follow .\n\u201c Our system is designed to give criminal defendants extraordinary protections at the time of trial .\nAt some point , the process should be afforded a presumption of finality , \u201d says former D.C. Superior Court judge Stuart Nash .\n\u201c It seems fundamentally unfair to make the government defend the legitimacy of a result many years later , and even more unfair that the victim of a crime can not rely on the finality of that result.\n\u201d Sentencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the criminal code in the District .\nBut the idea of \u201c sentencing reform \u201d is intentionally opaque , William Otis tells RealClearInvestigations .\n\u201c Reform \u201d of sentencing means \u201c reduction , \u201d says Otis , an adjunct professor of law at Georgetown University Law School .\nSpecial counsel to President George H.W .\nBush , Otis was also chief of the appellate sivision of the U.S. attorney \u2019 s office for the Eastern District of Virginia .\n\u201c We tried being nice , \u201d he says of the lenient sentencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What we got in exchange was a gigantic increase in crime.\n\u201d Between 1960 and 1990 the murder rate doubled in the United States .\nCrime shot up , Otis says , because \u201c we had the \u2018 compassionate \u2019 rehab-oriented policies liberals want to bring back now.\n\u201d The proposed rewrite of the D.C. criminal code \u201c would have been right at home in that era.\n\u201d The District of Columbia is not the only place rewriting its criminal code \u2013 although rising crime is forcing reconsiderations elsewhere .\nReform-minded Colorado \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , last year \u2019 s reduction of the number of misdemeanors on its books , what had been Senate Bill 21-271 .\nThis year the legislature passed \u201c The Senate Bill 21-271 Clean Up.\n\u201d It was signed by the governor last month .\nColorado \u2019 s crime rate is soaring , with car theft up more than 80 % from 2019 to 2021 .\nAnd while it might be unfair to attribute such a rise to the 2021 code changes , since they took effect only two months ago , it doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for changes to kick in when voters are experiencing the anxiety and uncertainty that comes with rising crime .\nSimilarly , New Hampshire in 2018 passed bail reforms making it significantly easier for those accused of violent crimes to get bail automatically .\nMany , such as Manchester Police Department chief Allen Aldenberg , have argued that the changes to bail laws put dangerous criminals on the street .\n\u201c What \u2019 s it going to take ?\n\u201d Aldenberg asked state legislators .\n\u201c Someone being murdered by somebody that \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over ?\n\u201d New Hampshire lawmakers nearly passed legislation early this month to tighten the availability of bail .\nThe narrow failure of the bill was an illustration of how difficult it is to undo changes to policing and prosecution once those revisions are on the books .\nLike the District of Columbia , other jurisdictions have established official advisory groups setting out how to rewrite criminal laws , such as California \u2019 s Committee on Revision of the Penal Code .\nSeveral of its recommendations have already been adopted , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of non-violent crimes .\nIn its 2020 report , the California committee cited statistics it claimed showed there was no threat to public safety from the sort of reforms it recommended .\n\u201c According to the most recent data from the California Department of Justice , California has the lowest crime rates since comprehensive statewide statistics were first recorded in 1969 , \u201d the committee reported , citing crime figures through 2019 .\n\u201c This continues a 30-year trend of steadily decreasing crime rates .\nAt the same time , the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of people incarcerated in its state prison system.\n\u201d But California crime statistics for 2020 proved to be less of an advertisement for the changes promoted by the committee .\nOverall , the rate of violent crime increased .\nFor example , there were 104,756 aggravated assaults in 2019 ; in 2020 there were 113,539 .\nRape and robbery rates did fall slightly , but from 2019 to 2020 the homicide rate went up 31 % .\nThe rate at which police \u201c cleared \u201d homicides fell to its lowest in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d says John Lott , former chief economist for the U.S .\nSentencing Commission .\nHe tells RealClearInvestigations , \u201c If you make it less risky to commit a crime , you will get more of the crime.\n\u201d Or , as William Otis puts it , \u201c This is not rocket science .\nIf we go back to the failed policies of the past , we \u2019 ll get the failed results of the past.\n\u201d \u201c The sole beneficiaries \u201d of the sort of reforms being pursued in the District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c will be criminals , \u201d says Otis .\n\u201c Is that what we need right now ?\n\u201d __________", "author": "Deneen Borelli",

disclosures .\nThe unintended consequences of the proposed SEC climate change disclosure rule will compound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets .\nThe proposed rule will likely act as a deterrent against companies going public thanks , in part , to a potential increased risk of frivolous lawsuits and the possible destabilization of the credibility of U.S. capital markets .\nFor the foreseeable future , fossil

Reliable Power During the Energy Transition Requires Natural Gas", "content": "In recent weeks , the power supply industry and grid operators have issued warnings that the American electric grid may be in for a difficult summer and customers across the country face the possibility of rolling blackouts or power rationing .\nThe situation is particularly worrisome in California , where CAISO , the regional market that coordinates power supply for the state , had blackouts during periods of high demand late in the summer of 2020 .\nLeading utilities in the state say that they are likely to need to fall back on natural gas to meet generation needs this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year as a result of Winter Storm Uri , which brought icy conditions and near-zero temperatures to the Lone Star State , knocking down powerlines and preventing the delivery of needed natural gas supplies .\nBut concerns about electric grid reliability are not limited to the West .\nAccording to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation , as generation has shifted to intermittent resources that are dependent upon weather conditions , America \u2019 s power generation has become \u201c sensitive to extreme , widespread , and long duration temperatures as well as wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the amount of power available in excess of demand , have been shrinking across the country as retirements of existing resources accelerate , investments in traditionally reliable resources decline , and renewable installations increase .\nNYISO , the organization charged with maintaining power system reliability for the State of New York , has warned that a sustained 98-degree heat wave could drive up energy demand enough to cause a shortfall for New York City as early as next year , likely forcing NYISO to call for rolling blackouts for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric grid headed for imminent reliability challenges ?\nThe answer depends on how policymakers and regulators address these very real and urgent concerns .\nFor the past 20 years competitive power markets have proven that we are capable of supplying reliable , affordable , and increasingly clean power to millions of Americans .\nIn fact , a recent study conducted by Drs .\nJosh Rhodes and Lynn Kiesling found that regions where competitive power markets operate have enjoyed significant cost savings and reduced emissions across their footprint \u2013 greater than in traditional , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PJM Interconnection , the nation \u2019 s largest competitive power market , boasts an annual savings for customers of up to $ 4 billion annually , and CO2 emissions dropped by more than a third from 2005 to 2020 .\nHow PJM is able to deliver reliable power at the least cost for consumers \u2013 while also driving down emissions \u2013 is no mystery .\nCompetition among power providers has driven innovation and investment in highly efficient technologies .\nWhile competition in these markets is key to reliable , affordable , and clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach to the resources that fuel that power .\nAs the Shale Revolution swept across the United States , lower natural gas prices drove many coal-fired generation facilities to retire .\nIn this case , the market picked the winning fuel\u2014investing in reliable , affordable , cleaner-burning natural gas , and the environment and economy benefited from those market signals .\nAs renewables and other zero emissions resources proliferate across the country with the installation of new wind farms , solar arrays , and battery storage , the price of renewable energy will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will help solve challenges associated with cost and emissions , their inherent intermittency leaves us vulnerable to reliability issues .\nIn effect , the U.S. is moving toward two distinct systems : one that leverages zero emissions resources and is largely the result of state and federal policies , and another backup system that actually provides the reliability the grid needs through natural gas ( and even coal ) .\nPolicies that seek to advance intermittent zero emission resources are in effect requiring a duplicative set of systems to separately address emissions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at sufficient scale to smooth over the natural ebbs and flows of intermittent generation , we will need natural gas to remain part of the vital fuel mix .\nThe latest Energy Information Administration data show that not only is demand for natural gas not declining , it \u2019 s hitting new records .\nThanks to extreme cold and the retirement of coal generation , natural gas consumption in the power sector averaged 31.6 billion cubic feet per day in January 2022 .\nNatural gas generation is affordable to build and can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( unlike firm baseload resources like coal or nuclear ) , then ramped down when renewable resources are once again able to handle demand .\nNew builds could include carbon capture technology to further reduce emissions , and older facilities could be retrofitted .\nBut making that scenario possible tomorrow requires new investments today .\nOn the production side , some gas producers are saying that without increased pipeline capacity , it may be difficult for them to increase natural gas supply , even as prices rise and they are incentivized to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity demand is only expected to increase .\nAs appliances and cars increasingly switch to electricity , demand will continue its upward trajectory .\nRenewable power generation will increase , too , but likely not at the rate of demand and due to its intermittency , it takes numerous megawatts of renewable capacity to replace one megawatt of thermal capacity .\nBattery storage is one area of innovation that can address intermittency , but there again , storage levels are likely to fall short of what \u2019 s needed .\nAnd without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s produced to where it \u2019 s needed , reliability could be in real jeopardy .\nFor energy consumers , reliability is key .\nIn our day-to-day lives , it ensures the lights stay on and we remain connected to coworkers , friends , and family .\nIn extreme weather events , it can mean the difference between life and death .\nSo , as we look to a low-carbon future , it is important not to abandon investments in the resources that can deliver reliable power as the energy transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that strengthen the grid and invest in reliability .\n__________ Todd Snitchler is the president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association , which represents

"content": "American sovereignty will be on the line next week , and most Americans aren \u2019 t even aware of it .\nIf they were , they \u2019 d be raising a ruckus \u2013 which , of course , is precisely why the Biden administration has done its best to keep its actions hidden from as many as possible for as long as possible .\nIn early January , the Biden administration sent the global bureaucrats at the World Health Organization a set of proposed amendments to the International Health Regulations to be considered by the World Health Assembly at United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nRepresentatives from almost 200 countries will gather there to consider these proposed amendments , each of which does one of two things \u2013 either it gives WHO more power , or it reduces the member nations \u2019 rights to make their own decisions .\nIn other words , these amendments move power and control from America \u2019 s government ( which derives its just powers from the consent of the governed ) to an international body of bureaucrats ( for which no American citizen voted ) .\nTo borrow from Yogi Berra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , they \u2019 d be rolling over in their graves .\nThe very first document that can truly be called \u201c American \u201d is our Declaration of Independence , in which our Founding Fathers explained the reasoning behind their decision to break from the mother country .\nThese men claimed , at the very beginning of that document , the right \u201c to assume among the power of the earth , the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature \u2019 s God entitle them \u2026 \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe new country they proclaimed in that document was entitled to be treated the same as every other country on the planet , with all the same rights and privileges \u2013 in their words , \u201c as Free and Independent States , they have full Power to levy War , conclude Peace , contract Alliances , establish Commerce , and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.\n\u201d But now come the radical extremists who populate the Biden administration .\nTheir vision is different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amendments they \u2019 ve proposed , they don \u2019 t seem to care about protecting America \u2019 s sovereignty .\nRep. Chris Smith , the ranking member of the House Global Health Subcommittee , explains : \u201c The alarming amendments offered by the Biden Administration to the WHO \u2019 s International Health Regulations would grant new unilateral authority to [ WHO ] Director-General Tedros to declare a public health crisis in the United States or other sovereign nations , without any consultation with the U.S. or any other WHO member .\nSpecifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current regulation that requires the WHO to \u2018 consult with and attempt to obtain verification from the State Party in whose territory the event is allegedly occurring in , \u2019 ceding the United States \u2019 ability to declare and respond to an infectious disease outbreak within the United States , dependent on the judgment of a corrupt and complicit UN bureaucracy.\n\u201d To make matters even worse , the body of international bureaucrats the Biden administration is preparing to cede power to isn \u2019 t just any band of international bureaucrats , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international bureaucrats whose performance during the pandemic was outrageously bad .\nWHO covered for the Chinese Communist Party by tweeting in the early days of the pandemic that there was \u201c no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus , \u201d even though the CCP leadership knew this was false , and then dismissing the possibility that the novel coronavirus was developed in a laboratory in Wuhan .\nWhy in the world is the Biden administration yielding power to these people ?\nAnd that \u2019 s not all .\nThe proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story , but the beginning .\nLast December , the World Health Assembly launched an effort to draft a new \u201c international pandemic preparedness \u201d treaty , which would likely give these international health bureaucrats even more power .\nThat treaty isn \u2019 t scheduled to be ready until 2024 .\nIf these amendments to the International Health Regulations are any indication , that treaty is going to be even worse .\nThe Biden administration is hoping that an America distracted by raging inflation , rising crime , a growing crisis on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortage , a pending decision by the Supreme Court on a crucial abortion case , and all the other challenges we are currently experiencing will not notice their attempt to cede U.S. sovereignty

Force Problem Goes Beyond Economics", "content": "One legacy of the COVID-19 pandemic could be the devastation it brought to the American worker by disconnecting millions from the workforce .\nNew research estimates that 3 million workers plan to remain permanently sidelined over concerns of physical illness or physical impairment due to COVID-19 .\nThe research team named this phenomenon \u201c Long Social Distancing \u201d and found that more than 13 % of Americans who worked in 2019 plan to continue social distancing after the pandemic ends .\nAn additional 46 % will engage in limited forms of social distancing .\nThe study estimates the depressed labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dampen Gross Domestic Product by 1.4 % .\nBut the impact on individuals and their families will be far worse .\nSeparation from the labor force obviously means less income and financial security for the individual \u2019 s future .\nBut there are other costs from nonwork that extend beyond the financial disadvantages , including long-term mental , physical , and social health impacts for workers , their children , their families , and their communities .\nSimply put , our labor force situation today is a social , mental , and community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s particularly true for the poor and working class .\nDuring the pandemic , the so-called \u201c laptop class \u201d of professional workers fared fairly well .\nThey were able to maintain social distance from others while still working to earn income .\nMany of these workers found that remote jobs allowed them to create a healthier work-life balance , so they abandoned their former desk jobs in favor of a more flexible lifestyle .\nIn stark contrast , working-class adults who couldn \u2019 t perform their jobs from home have been hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were often placed at a higher risk of COVID-19 exposure .\nOthers suffered more because their employers shut down , resulting in a devastating loss of income .\nMany small business owners suffered income loss and in some cases were forced to close their businesses permanently .\nAccording to the Long Social Distancing study , the majority of Americans who don \u2019 t plan to return to work have a high school education or less ( 17.6 % ) .\nUnemployment tended to decrease based on both education level and income , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who previously earned $ 10,000 to $ 20,000 per year .\nNonwork was highest among females aged 50-64 ( 17.5 % ) , followed by male respondents of the same age group ( 12.9 % ) .\nIt follows , then , that the most significant impact labor non-participation will have on America lies among lower-income communities \u2014 many of whom were likely already struggling to make ends meet .\nFederal stimulus programs have been important to these individuals , helping them weather the combined storm of the virus and government-imposed lockdowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustained many people throughout the crisis , they also created major problems as we emerge from the worst of the pandemic .\nSome unemployed people found that they were better off leaving their jobs and receiving government assistance instead .\nIn many cases , unemployment benefits paid better than the jobs they \u2019 d previously occupied .\nThis aggravated pre-existing issues with labor force non-participation , helping to fuel inflation as work stoppages led to disruptions in the supply-chain flow of goods and services .\nWorsening the problem even more , many Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their government support , such as food stamps , fell off in response to an increase in income .\nIn some cases , families lost government benefits after a comparatively small pay raise .\nThis creates additional disincentives for work .\nSo , what \u2019 s the path forward ?\nIn order to get unemployed adults back to work , we \u2019 ll need a change in perspective .\nWork must be regarded as something worthwhile in itself beyond a weekly or biweekly paycheck , because it is .\nA steady job gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides a stable life to their families , and helps maintain mental health .\nNonwork has a direct impact on children not only in the present , but as research shows it can impact their future , too .\nIt creates perpetuating cycles of dependency that lead to instability for the children in these homes .\nThis creates a systemic crisis in marginalized communities .\nIf our goal is truly to overcome generational poverty , creating a culture that uplifts and prizes work is essential .\nIt \u2019 s essential to address safety-net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Programs that help in the immediate aftermath of job loss are not enough .\nIn addition to meeting immediate needs \u2014 such as unemployment assistance and food \u2014 unemployed individuals need support and encouragement to know that work is beneficial to our mental and social health .\nAnd importantly , safety net programs can not create disincentives from earning more money and getting ahead in society .\nGovernment programs need to be reconfigured so they no longer interfere with the upward economic mobility of individuals and their families .\nThey need to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their families over the long-term , not just the short-term .\nOur ultimate goal should be to help those sidelined by the pandemic reconnect to work \u2014 not only for their economic health , but for

they use similar language about an alleged white menace to malign their opponents and frighten their supporters .\nIn highly partisan and divisive remarks delivered following the racist May 14 mass

our democracy \u201d \u2013 is false .\nMuch of their \u201c evidence \u201d comes from groups with long histories of misinformation , such as the Southern Poverty Law Center , whose business model depends on ginning up fears about supposed threats .\nIn the aftermath of the Buffalo massacre , the New York Times trumpeted a 2021 \u201c Murder and Extremism \u201d report from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u201c political right has a violence problem.\n\u201d But , as my RealClearInvestigations colleague James Varney reports , this characterization is as misleading as it is inflammatory .\nThe ADL reports that white supremacists accounted for 244 ( 55 % ) of the 443 killings that the ADL \u201c documented \u201d between 2012 and 2021 .\nFifty-five percent \u2013 that sounds big !\nVarney notes that during that same period , there were about 165,000 murders in the United States .\nThus , white supremacists accounted for 0.001 % of the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case because the ADL admits most of

report said .\n\u201c The remainder were group-related but not ideological attacks , were related to traditional criminal activities , or were murders for which no clear motive could be

States .\nOne murder is , of course , one too many .\nAnd the terror sparked by the four massacres that account for half of the white supremacist tally \u2013 Dylann Roof \u2019 s rampage at a black church in Charleston in 2015 ( nine dead , one injured ) ; the Pittsburgh Tree of Life synagogue shooting in 2018 ( 11 dead , six injured ) ; and the 2019 attack at the El Paso Walmart ( 23 dead , 23

president \u2019 s in-house economist was responsible , in part , for the exact bet the White House placed so publicly : that inflation wouldn \u2019 t last long and that increased federal spending wouldn \u2019 t add to inflationary pressure .\nAmerica was going through a cold start , after all , revving from 0-60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be speed bumps along the way back to normal , and Deese and others reasoned last year that while it might cost more to pay rent each month and fill up a tank of gas every week and put food on the table every day , the pain would only be \u201c transitory.\n\u201d Then inflation jumped month after month , hitting a 40-year high in March , and the Washington Post asked Deese Tuesday if the \u201c transitory inflation \u201d line had been responsible for giving Americans a false sense of hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , I think that this has been an uncertain and unexpected recovery period , \u201d he replied before adding that it was also \u201c historic in many ways.\n\u201d Deese said that it was a strong economy , one that has been bolstered by trillions in federal relief spending that had helped Americans get back on their feet .\nHe added also \u201c that inflation is a global challenge , \u201d one made harder by unforeseen complications , like the Russian invasion of Ukraine , that rattled markets and kinked supply chains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d he explained , was to find the right policy \u201c to bring prices down without sacrificing all of the economic gains that we have made.\n\u201d Down the hall from the briefing room , in the Oval Office just hours earlier , Biden met with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell .\nThe administration is currently drawing up a flight plan to achieve the soft landing that Deese described , one where the Fed increases interest rates and brings down inflation but doesn \u2019 t shock the system and risk causing a recession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden has vowed not to \u201c meddle with the Fed.\n\u201d This was a key point of emphasis in the first part of his three-pronged approach to tackle inflation , laid out in the Wall Street Journal .\nHe appointed economists from both parties to helm that institution , and he wrote that he agrees with their assessment that inflation \u201c is our top economic challenge right now.\n\u201d The second prong of Biden \u2019 s plan was urging Congress to \u201c help right away by passing clean energy tax credits and investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending on public housing , prescription drug benefits , and childcare .\nThe third prong , \u201c reducing the federal deficit \u201d through \u201c common-sense reforms to the tax code , \u201d in turn would \u201c help ease price pressures.\n\u201d The White House , meanwhile , is also reportedly weighing a plan to cancel as much as $ 10,000 in student debt for households making less than $ 300,000 .\nAnalysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget pegs the cost of that proposed plan for taxpayers at around $ 250 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c the president hasn \u2019 t made any decision on that policy.\n\u201d Asked if the administration was confident that student debt forgiveness , whatever shape that policy takes in the end , would not contribute to higher inflation as borrowers spend money on goods and services rather than on loan payments , Deese replied that the economic impact would be spread out over decades .\n\u201c And so , \u201d he said , \u201c the impact on inflation in the near term is likely to be quite small.\n\u201d Republicans were unimpressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their argument is not merely that Biden has been inattentive to inflation , but rather that his policies are responsible for it .\nRetiring Ohio Sen .\nRob Portman summed up that sentiment , writing on Twitter that inflation was \u201c due to the Biden admin \u2019 s excessive spending \u201d and chided the White House for not listening sooner to Democratic economists like Larry Summers who warned that increased spending \u201c would overheat the economy.\n\u201d As they look to November , the GOP insists that the larger story is that Biden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNot so , said Deese .\nThe president feels their pain and is approaching the inflation issue from a \u201c kitchen table \u201d perspective : \u201c He understands that right now the top issue on people \u2019 s minds is prices \u2013 prices at the gas station , prices at the grocery store .\nAnd he \u2019 s made very clear , and he \u2019 s communicating very clearly , that that \u2019 s his top economic priority , and that we can address this from a position of strength.\n\u201d Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimism .\nDeese wasn \u2019 t the only one to face the ghost of the \u201c transitory inflation \u201d rhetoric .\nWolf Blitzer asked Janet Yellen on CNN if it had been a mistake to downplay the risk of inflation last year .\nThe Treasury secretary said she had made a mistake .\n\u201c I think I was wrong then about the path that inflation would take , \u201d Yellen told Blitzer .\n\u201c There have been unanticipated and large shocks to the economy , \u201d she added , \u201c that have affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I didn \u2019 t fully understand.\n\u201d Inflation was \u201c still too high \u201d and there was more work to be done , she concluded , \u201c but in recent reports , we \u2019 ve seen it move down.\n\u201d __________ Philip Wegmann , RealClearPolitics", "author": "Deneen Borelli", "url":

schools are settings where young Americans develop into citizens and become socialized to particular ideas , values , and civic norms .\nAttitudes toward democracy and disagreement are forged in these spaces .\nIn this context , the findings of the Knight Foundation \u2019 s just-released report on high schoolers \u2019 attitudes toward free speech should worry us .\nThe report , part of the Knight Foundation \u2019 s Future of the First Amendment project , finds that high school students censor themselves at levels currently seen on collegiate campuses .\nThere is some good news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The data powerfully illustrate that Gen Z high school students today are open to free speech and do not support cancel culture or the rampant censorship that threatens learning and viewpoint diversity .\nWhile civics knowledge has been in decline for decades , a healthy majority of high school students \u2013 63 percent \u2013 say that they have taken classes that dealt with the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution .\nThe report also demonstrates a strong appreciation of and support for viewpoint diversity .\nWhen asked if people should be allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students strongly agree with this statement , while another 32 percent mildly agree .\nThis means that almost nine in 10 high school students support freedom of expression : thus , young Americans are hardly in favor of censorship .\nMoreover , the overwhelming majority of today \u2019 s high school students understand that a healthy democracy requires certain crucial conditions .\nNinety-two percent of students , for example , believe that it is important to protect the ability of different groups in society to be heard .\nAnother 91 percent hold that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange of ideas and views , and 93 percent say that it is important to have an inclusive society welcoming to diverse groups .\nThis is all encouraging news .\nBut the data also show that high school students are censoring themselves in the classroom .\nOnly 19 percent of students said that they were very comfortable voicing disagreement with ideas expressed by the instructor or by other students .\nAnother 36 percent were somewhat comfortable , meaning that just over half ( 55 percent ) of students were comfortable disagreeing with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemble those related to the state of free speech on college campuses .\nIn the spring of 2021 , FIRE and College Pulse surveyed over 37,000 college and university students about their levels of comfort in disagreeing with professors .\nJust 40 percent of college students surveyed reported that they would be very or somewhat comfortable publicly disagreeing with a professor about a controversial topic ; only 51 percent stated that they would be very or somewhat comfortable expressing their views on a controversial political topic during a class discussion .\nThe Knight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse in high school .\nSadly , the findings from Knight also mirror earlier survey data that I collected with Next Gen Politics showing that a significant number of high school students are not comfortable sharing their thoughts in class .\nSixty percent of students surveyed said that they have felt they could not express their opinions on a subject because of how students , teachers , or the administration would respond \u2013 a proportion identical to that of college students who report self-censoring on campuses .\nFurther analysis of the Next Gen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been self-censoring both inside and outside the classroom .\nHigh school students regularly report that they crave dissent in dialogue , yet they are uncomfortable expressing it themselves for fear of being shunned or canceled .\nThis repressive climate is toxic for our educational system , which is anchored on the classically liberal idea that people can disagree and still find common ground .\nAs many of these high school students will prepare for the workforce or collegiate settings , they are being conditioned to keep silent rather than dissent or question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy at risk .\nIt is time for families , communities , and education professionals to demand better and embrace the debate and discourse that comes with real education .\n__________ Samuel J.

\u2019 s running mate in 2020 and was considered a likely contender for a statewide office .\nBut both Democrats endured stinging election outcomes Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most liberal cities in the country ousted Boudin in a blow to a movement toward more lenient prosecutors amid a pandemic spike in murder and home invasions , random attacks on elderly Asians , and smash-and-grab robberies that unsettled voters across California and the nation .\nSome of those crimes in the city have subsided along with COVID rates , but aggressive thefts in broad daylight , sometimes caught on video , left their mark on San Franciscans \u2019 psyche .\nSan Francisco voted to recall Boudin with 60 % support compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Associated Press declared shortly after 9 p.m. on the West Coast .\nMayor London Breed will now appoint Boudin \u2019 s successor .\nBass also faced an embarrassing outcome in a city dominated by Democrats .\nEarly returns Tuesday night showed her coming in a close second in the Los Angeles mayor \u2019 s race to Rick Caruso , a former Republican billionaire real estate developer who only changed his party affiliation to Democrat before entering the race .\nIn the final weeks , the contest became far more competitive with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city \u2019 s homelessness .\nCaruso pledged to hire 1,500 new police officers within his first term and build 30,000 shelter beds in his first 300 days .\nBass \u2019 plan to reduce crime focused mainly on criminal justice reform .\nThe result will impact both the November midterms and the criminal justice reform movement , with Republicans already citing Boudin \u2019 s ouster in the deeply liberal city as evidence that voters are ready to punish Democrats perceived as soft on crime .\n\u201c Voters are sick and tired of the Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sacramento that has led to surging crime , sky-high gas prices , failing schools , a homeless crisis and more , \u201d California Republican Party Chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson said Tuesday night in a statement .\n\u201c This November , voters have the opportunity to support a better vision for the Golden State .\nRepublicans are ready for the

Caruso in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where liberalism \u2019 s excesses and population exodus have become laugh lines for conservative talk show hosts .\nIt wasn \u2019 t because the two candidates \u2019 policies and backgrounds came as a surprise .\nBoudin \u2019 s parents , Weather Underground members , were arrested when he was 14 months old and convicted on felony murder charges for their role as getaway car drivers in the Brinks robbery of 1981 .\nThey were sentenced to decades to life in prison , and Boudin then went to live with adoptive parents Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders of the Weather Underground , a left-wing militant group that sought to overthrow American imperialism .\nIt \u2019 s the same Ayers whose contacts with then-presidential candidate Barack Obama spurred controversy during the 2008 presidential campaign .\nBefore Yale law school and his work at the San Francisco Public Defender \u2019 s office , Boudin served a stint as a translator for socialist revolutionary Hugo Chavez and co-wrote a book about the Venezuelan socialist revolution Chavez led .\nMeanwhile , Bass traveled to Cuba in the early 1970s to work on projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fidel Castro after his 2016 death \u2013 issues that came up as big liabilities with Florida voters during Biden \u2019 s veepstakes .\nBut on Tuesday , voters led revolts of their own against Boudin and his far-left ideology and sent a strong message to Bass that they are wary about her ability to fix the problems plaguing Los Angeles .\nBeyond California , Boudin \u2019 s ouster sends a clear message that urban progressives \u2019 stance on criminal justice has alienated even the Democrats \u2019 loyal voting base .\nBoudin \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state and the nation Tuesday night .\nLos Angeles Deputy District Attorney Jon Hatami predicted that his own boss , George Gascon , would lose his recall when voters go to the polls in November .\n\u201c What I want to tell everybody and tell [ Los Angeles DA ] George Gascon is , you \u2019 re next , \u201d Hatami told Fox News .\n\u201c The people of Los Angeles have had enough.\n\u201d In 2019 , Boudin was elected on a promise to end cash bail , lower the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternatives for harsh sentences for some criminals .\nAs he worked to implement the reforms , the pandemic hit , and burglaries and auto thefts spiked .\nHomicides also went up during the past two years , the Wall Street Journal reports .\nSan Francisco also owns this dark statistic : Fentanyl overdoses killed more people than COVID-19 in the city over the last year .\nBut the deaths of two innocent women by a man with a long criminal history may have sealed Boudin \u2019 s fate .\nRecall organizers repeatedly blasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a man who had a history of robberies and arrests who hit two women with a stolen car on New Year \u2019 s Eve in 2020 in downtown San Francisco , killing both of them .\nMcAlister was free because Boudin \u2019 s office negotiated a plea deal on the most recent armed robbery charge .\nBoudin has said it \u2019 s a case that keeps him up at night but also argued that \u201c there \u2019 s always going to be cases where if we look back , we would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Boudin tried to push back at his critics , casting the recall as a right-wing funded campaign aimed at halting the national criminal justice movement .\nHe called his opponents \u201c Trumpian \u201d and referred to William Oberndorf , a wealthy businessman and conservative donor , as an \u201c oligarch , \u201d but also gave no indication that he would shift away from his more lenient approach to criminals if left in office .\nAfter the AP declared the recall successful , Boudin said at an election-night watch party that his push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform was far from over .\n\u201c This is a movement , not a moment in history , \u201d Boudin said .\n\u201c The coalition that we built \u2026 it is broad , it is diverse , it is strong .\nAnd it is a coalition that is deeply committed to justice , \u201d he added , blaming his loss on corporate interests who outspent him \u201c three to one.\n\u201d Leading up to the election , however , the New York Times and Newsweek outlets ran stories highlighting high-profile San Francisco Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the left .\nSeveral of them , including the former chair of the San Francisco Democratic Party Mary Jung , said the squalor and spike in petty crime and break-ins was behind their decisions to take a stand .\nBut Boudin has pointed to statistics showing violent crime overall remaining stagnant .\nHe also blamed police for having among the lowest arrest rates of major cities .\nIn the Los Angeles Mayor \u2019 s race , Bass accused Caruso of political opportunism and trying to buy the election .\nThe self-funding Caruso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costing his campaign at least $ 10 million of the $ 40 million he \u2019 s already spent .\nThe grainy videos hit her on everything from her inability to address rising crime rates to missed House votes to a dust-up over a University of Southern California scholarship .\n( Bass received a USC scholarship worth $ 95,000 while serving in Congress . )\nIn response to the attacks , in April , Bass announced a plan \u201c to combat crime \u201d that was focused on preventing \u201c the conditions that lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have made mistakes.\n\u201d But her proposal produced a surprising backlash .\nIn mid-May , legendary Long Beach rapper Snoop Dogg reached out to Caruso and offered his endorsement with cameras capturing the exchange , although he didn \u2019 t elaborate on his decision .\nRising violent crime during 2020 , the first year of the pandemic , disproportionately impacted black and Hispanic people , according to the Marshall Project .\nSnoop Dogg joined actress Gwyneth Paltrow , reality TV star Kim Kardashian , Tesla \u2019 s Elon Musk , and Netflix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrities backing Caruso .\nBass has the backing of actor-rapper Donald Glover , as well as director J.J. Abrams and Endeavor chief executive Ari Emanuel .\nUnlike Boudin , Bass has an opportunity to make up ground in November after Tuesday \u2019 s primary that suffered from one of the lowest turnout rates in years .\nWhether she will shift gears and take a tougher stance on crime is yet to be seen .\nBass didn \u2019 t immediately react to Caruso \u2019 s slight early lead nor the race being declared a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Caruso was ebullient over his strong showing .\n\u201c This is a great night because so many people have gone to the voting booth and sent a message : We are not helpless in the face of our problems , \u201d he told supporters .\n\u201c We will not allow this city to decline .\nWe will no longer accept excuses .\nWe have the power to change the direction of Los Angeles , and that \u2019 s the way we \u2019 re voting.\n\u201d __________", "author": "Deneen Borelli", "url": "https://deneenborelli.com/2022/06/commentary-will-boudins-recall-reverberate-across-the-nation/", "published": "Thu, 09 Jun 2022 14:15:40 +0000", "published_utc": 1654798540, "collection_utc": 1654813647}, {"id": "deneenborelli--2022-06-11--Gasoline Prices Soar to $5 a Gallon Under Biden", "date": "2022-06-11", "source": "deneenborelli", "title": "Gasoline Prices Soar to $5 a Gallon Under Biden", "content": "The average price of gasoline soared to $ 5 a gallon for the first time according to CNN .\nCNN used data from AAA in its report .\nThe story notes gasoline prices have been soaring over the last two months and the prices have gone up 15 days in a row .\nIt appears $ 5 a gallon is not the end and gasoline could reach $ 6 a gallon as summer driving boosts demand .\nThe high gasoline prices are forcing Americans to change their behavior .\nA Rasmussen Reports poll found , \u201c 57 % of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has affected their vacation plans for this summer.\n\u201d Facing low poll numbers due to inflation and high gas prices , President Biden tried to relate to Americans dealing with gas station sticker shock by falsely claiming his family struggled with gasoline prices during his youth .\nThe fact is Biden contributed to the high gas prices because his energy policy is focused on reducing domestic production of oil and natural gas while pushing the use of electric vehicles .\nOutrageous gas prices will play a big role in the upcoming midterm elections @", "author": "Tom Borelli", "url": "https://deneenborelli.com/2022/06/gasoline-prices-soar-to-5-a-gallon-under-biden/", "published": "Sat, 11 Jun 2022 15:37:57 +0000", "published_utc": 1654976277, "collection_utc": 1654986344}, {"id": "deneenborelli--2022-06-13--Podcast: Democrats Are Lying to You and Think You\u2019re Stupid", "date": "2022-06-13", "source": "deneenborelli", "title": "Podcast: Democrats Are Lying to You and Think You\u2019re Stupid", "content": "Fox News contributor Deneen Borelli and Newsmax TV contributor Dr. Tom Borelli deliver the truth in black and white on @ @ @ @ @ they think you \u2019 re stupid !\nWe discuss President Biden \u2019 s recent appearance @ @ @ @ @ not go well , how the Democrats are doing anything possible to distract the public @ @ @ @ @ , and we get into Biden \u2019 s disastrous record in politics over the course @ @ @ @ @ here !\nAlso sign up and subscribe to our Reigniting Liberty podcast here .", "author": "Deneen Borelli", "url": "https://deneenborelli.com/2022/06/podcast-democrats-are-lying-to-you-and-think-youre-stupid/", "published": "Mon, 13 Jun 2022 12:28:00 +0000", "published_utc": 1655137680, "collection_utc": 1655159371}, {"id": "deneenborelli--2022-06-14--Commentary:  Kavanaugh Assassination Plot Draws Muted White House Response", "date": "2022-06-14", "source": "deneenborelli", "title": "Commentary:  Kavanaugh Assassination Plot Draws Muted White House Response", "content": "The would-be assassin had a knife and a gun and , in the end , cold feet : When Nicholas Roske saw the U.S. marshals standing outside the home of Brett Kavanaugh , the 26-year-old Californian called off his plan to kill the Supreme Court justice and phoned the police to turn himself in instead .\nIt wasn \u2019 t just good luck , though , that prevented a tragedy that would have destroyed a family and roiled America \u2019 s civic life even further .\nIt was no accident that armed U.S. marshals happened to be in the exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNo , the fact that federal law enforcement were in a position to be \u201c instrumental in this person not accomplishing that horrible deed , \u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told RealClearPolitics , was due \u2013 in no small part \u2013 to the diligence of the Biden administration .\n\u201c One of the reasons \u201d the plot failed was because the Department of Justice took threats against Kavanaugh \u2019 s life \u201c very seriously from the beginning.\n\u201d Republicans and Democrats have been locked in a bitter battle over abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion overturning Roe v.

that they were \u201c something clearly the DOJ is looking into.\n\u201d Less clear : whether the White House believes protestors ought to picket the homes of judges in an attempt to influence pending cases .\nThe pro-abortion group Ruth Sent Us posted a map of conservative justices \u2019 residences , and a steady stream of activists have subsequently set up shop there since early last month .\nThe thwarted assassin later told authorities that he found the address of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president condoned that kind of protest , Jean-Pierre told RCP on Monday , \u201c We have not weighed in on where people should or should not protest.\n\u201d \u201c We have said that all Americans have the right to peacefully protest , whatever their point of view , \u201d she added , \u201c but that

does not mean they are violent.\n\u201d \u201c I know that there \u2019 s an outrage right now , I guess , about protests that have been peaceful to date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u2013 outside of judges \u2019 homes .\nAnd that \u2019 s the president \u2019 s position , \u201d Psaki said at that same briefing .\nWhat was hypocritical , in the administration view , was how the Republicans who said nothing about protesting school boards were raising the alarm over Supreme Court protests .\nShe said , \u201c The silence is pretty deafening.\n\u201d The law , meanwhile , appears black and white .\nPer Section 1507 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code , it is illegal to protest outside a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge \u201d if the expressed intent is \u201c interfering with , obstructing , or impeding the administration of justice.\n\u201d Activists are undeterred .\n\u201c Don \u2019 t like me at your house ?\n\u201d read the sign of one picketer , \u201c Stay out of my uterus.\n\u201d Congress has taken up legislation to increase security for Supreme Court justices and their families in line with the kind of protections that other high-ranking officials in the executive receive .\nThe Senate unanimously agreed to that bill on May 9 , and Jean-Pierre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMinority Leader McCarthy , however , blasted House Speaker Pelosi for her inaction on that bill , \u201c which she had blocked three times.\n\u201d Pelosi told reporters that the justices , who have received 24/7 security since May , are protected .\n\u201c Nobody is in danger over the weekend , \u201d she said last

wandered the streets aimlessly , never knowing where my next meal would come from.\n\u201d That \u2019 s how a man named Riley summarized being homeless , addicted , and unemployed before he came to Watered Gardens , a mission in southwest Missouri .\nAfter spending time in our long-term recovery program , Riley has worked as a warehouse manager at a feedstore for over a year where he now has

learned a lot in our program , and he is just one of many individuals whose lives have been transformed by the power of work .\nBut we didn \u2019 t tell him about two trendy economic theories that are having a moment \u2014 and a reckoning .\nThe first theory \u2014 that no amount of printing and spending money can cause real problems because the government can always raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devalued money out of the economy \u2014 or modern monetary theory ( MMT ) , is the theory with the more established nomenclature and well-known supporters like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( NY-14 ) .\nCongressman John Yarmuth ( KY-3 ) , Chairman of the House Budget Committee , summarized MMT nicely in a public hearing , telling us that we shouldn \u2019 t think of the national debt as debt at all , but instead as our \u201c total investment.\n\u201d This is dangerous \u2014 and wrong .\nThe second , related theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserves one because it might be even more dangerous in the long-term .\nIn a nutshell , the theory is that welfare for able-bodied adults can be disconnected from work without consequences .\nAfter all , work requirements for programs like child tax credits , food stamps , and Medicaid are simply \u201c restrictions on low-income people \u201d according to Senator Sherrod Brown ( D-OH ) .\nOf course , you don \u2019 t need a degree in economics to know that work is not a restriction at all .\nAnd it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poverty .\nIt is a powerful force for dignity and independence .\nRiley experienced this firsthand .\nAnd that \u2019 s why modern work theory is so wrong .\nWe can not separate pay from work without wreaking havoc on our people , families , communities , and economy .\nA pastor in Kansas recently wrote to us about generational poverty saying , \u201c the primary cause is not a lack of money \u201d but the \u201c ease with [ which ] they can live off the system.\n\u201d He sees first-hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay people as much money as a job would .\nSadly , this Kansas pastor \u2019 s experience isn \u2019 t unique .\nFor millions of Americans , welfare pays more than work .\nUnfortunately , the pastor \u2019 s observation that , \u201c the temptation is to work the system rather than work for real , \u201d is playing out in family after family .\nAfter two years of COVID-19 policies , this is no longer the personal temptation of individuals .\nIt is the economic policy of our country .\nModern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-known pandemic policies like stimulus checks , child tax credits , and unemployment bonuses that aren \u2019 t tied to work .\nIt \u2019 s also about gutting work requirements in food stamps and spending nearly 90 percent of money for employment and training programs on a costly bureaucracy rather than on participants , all while increasing benefits by 25 percent .\nAdd all that to disability programs open to many Americans who could be working and long-standing policies which do not require able-bodied welfare enrollees on Medicaid or in public housing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even part-time ) and it \u2019 s easy to see why the temptation to remain on welfare is so great .\nEven before the pandemic and the \u201c Great Resignation , \u201d our workforce participation rate was lower than it was ten years earlier at the height of the Great Recession .\nThis is not sustainable .\nAmerica can \u2019 t work unless Americans are working .\nModern work theory does more than kill the engine of our economy by devaluing workers .\nIt kills the soul of our people by devaluing work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we forget what Riley said about work , that \u201c it \u2019 s a freeing experience \u201d and not a \u201c restriction , \u201d we won \u2019 t have an economy worth saving .\nThe liberty of work isn \u2019 t about a paycheck .\nIt \u2019 s the realization you can earn one .\n__________ James Whitford is the Executive Director of Watered Gardens Ministries , a

KIRBY : The President is going to Saudi for the GCC \u2014 the GCC+3 , to be honest .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There \u2019 s a big agenda there , Kaitlan , on the Gulf Cooperation Council .\nIt \u2019 s counterterrorism .\nIt \u2019 s climate change .\nCertainly , it \u2019 s \u2014 oil production , obviously , is going to be on the agenda .\nOPEC production of crude oil and other liquids is about 34-35 million barrels per day ( mmbd ) , of which Saudi output is about 10 mmbd , out of global production of around 100 mmbd .\nOPEC surplus production capacity is about 3 mmbd , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mmbd .\nHas no one in the administration asked the obvious question , to wit , what a plausible ( or even an implausible ) increase in GCC/Saudi crude oil output might yield in terms of U.S. gasoline prices ?\nAmazingly , it would appear not , as the answer is surprisingly small in the context of gasoline prices now averaging over $ 5 per gallon for the U.S. as a whole .\nSuppose that Mr. Biden convinces the Gulf producers to increase output by 1 mmbd \u2014 that is not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume that there is no production cut as a response by other producers internationally .\nThat would represent a global production increase ( crude oil and other liquids ) of about 1 percent .\nUnder a very conservative assumption about market demand conditions \u2014 a demand \u201c elasticity \u201d ( that is , \u201c responsiveness \u201d ) of 0.1 , crude oil prices would fall by about 10 percent , or around $ 12 per barrel .\nThe effect on gasoline prices assuming no change in refining and distribution costs , taxes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents per gallon , an effect not trivial , but obviously insufficient to change the underlying economics and politics of high gasoline prices in the U.S. Let us make alternative assumptions far more realistic : an increase in GCC/Saudi crude oil output of 250,000 b/d \u2014 0.25 percent of global production \u2014 and a market demand elasticity of 0.5 .\nCrude oil prices would fall by a half percent , or about 60 cents per barrel .\nAssume a larger price impact due to expectations effects and the like : a decline in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel .\nThe effect on gasoline prices : about 3 cents per gallon .\nUnder any set of plausible assumptions , Mr. Biden \u2019 s efforts to schmooze the Gulf producers to increase output are not going to yield the decline in gasoline prices that he seems unthinkingly to be assuming .\nHave none of the economists in the White House or the Council of Economic Advisers or the Office of Management and Budget or the Department of Energy made this obvious point ?\nDoes Susan Rice \u2014 the Director of the Domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some point the administration will be driven to recognize that its policies are responsible for high fuel prices , notwithstanding the short term imperative to blame Vladimir Putin , the oil companies , the failure of Congress to enact spending programs even bigger , supply chain rigidities , COVID , the existence of billionaires not paying their fair shares , and any number of other nostrums emerging as excuses useful for a White House communications operation desperate to navigate the daily news cycle .\nIt is the Biden administration that has made very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel reserves and such ancillary capital as pipelines .\nThe effect of this ideological obstructionism is to increase expected future prices , and therefore current prices as well , because an expectation of higher prices in the future creates an incentive to produce less now , so that the expected price path rises at the market rate of interest .\nModern presidents have not been particularly thoughtful , so that their policy initiatives tend to be driven by some combination of their instincts and the quality of the arguments that they receive from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can yield optimism with respect to the policy paths likely to be favored by Mr. Biden .\n__________

outlook seem sunnier .\nThat could mean a meaningless nod toward a solution , or just some verbal sleight of hand .\nExamples abound .\nThe baby formula shortage resulted in a belated , insufficient effort to fly product in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem .\nAirlines struggled to meet pre-pandemic demand , so their CEO \u2019 s received a stern Zoom call from Transportation Secretary Buttigieg

them to keep their current jobs .\nWhile homes are a bit more affordable here on the east side of the Missouri River , property taxes still pack quite a punch .\nWhen researching cost of living , they

we can all relate to the fact that things can simply get to a point where they are too expensive , even if that thing is a home and its property tax bill .\nBoth of these Iowa families had to make choices that prioritized their family budget , even when it meant doing without something they wanted .\nFor one family , which meant leaving their hometown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downsizing their home .\nThese stories are not unique , yet they help provide insight into why people move .\nLots of surveys document the reason for moving , but one interesting one is the United Van Lines mover \u2019 s survey , which tracks the company \u2019 s data for state-to-state migration patterns .\nFor Iowa , the total inbound migration was 49.5 % while total outbound was 50.5 % .\nThe primary reason for

situations .\nIllinois and Nebraska are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have an income tax and has an overall low tax burden .\nCaterpillar just recently announced that it is relocating its corporate headquarters from Illinois to Texas .\nTexas , another no income tax state , leads the nation for the number of fortune 500 company headquarters , many of whom have recently relocated to the state .\nLuckily , Iowa is on its way to being a low tax state thanks to the tax reform legislation enacted this year .\nGovernor Kim Reynolds signed into law the most historic tax reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new law will gradually phase down the progressive income tax rates until 2026 when a flat tax of 3.9 % will be implemented .\nIn addition , Iowa \u2019 s corporate tax will be gradually reduced until it reaches a

.\nIt is not just the United Van Lines that is demonstrating this , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people from high tax states .\nThe Covid-19 pandemic is also contributing to this trend as more people are allowed to work from home , which makes it more flexible to relocate .\nIowa is moving in the right direction in creating a more competitive tax climate , but policymakers need to make sure that Iowa does not become complacent .\nNumerous states are reducing their tax rates and Iowa needs to stay competitive .\nThis means that policymakers in Iowa must find a solution for high property taxes that

talk of conducting zero lease sales deep into the 2020s .\nThey should issue a robust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( OCS ) and hold mandated quarterly onshore lease sales with equitable terms .\nAdditionally , DOI should reinstate canceled sales and valid leases on federal lands and waters .\nThere is an environmental argument for production , too .\nEven DOI states that \u201c global emissions are only

threat of electricity blackouts in the U.S .\nIt brings to mind Ernest Hemmingway \u2019 s line in The Sun Also Rises about bankruptcy happening \u201c two ways\u2026gradually , then suddenly.\n\u201d For years , electric reliability has been an increasing concern .\nNonetheless , it \u2019 s all a bit jarring to see evidence that much of the U.S. is shifting from the \u201c gradually \u201d phase of electric reliability decline and into the \u201c suddenly \u201d phase .\nMy former agency , the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is concerning .\nThe problem is not limited to just one region of the country \u2013 it spreads across two-thirds of it .\nWhile the blackouts in Texas and California are the most obvious examples of the reliability cliff , they are no longer alone .\nThe Midcontinent Independent System Operator , which runs the grid in much of the central U.S. , lost 2.3 percent of its generating capacity in just the last year and is issuing notices that it may be short of power during the summer .\nMuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk .\nNew York \u2019 s and New England \u2019 s vulnerability to disruption , especially in the winter , is real and

report .\nA NERC spokesman said , \u201c It \u2019 s clear the risks are spreading .\n\u2026 and the pace of our grid transformation is a bit out of sync with the underlying realities and the physics of the system.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power plants have retired relative to the capabilities of the grid we have today .\nMy point here is not to bash renewable energy or other emerging technologies , but we had better have a plan for how to integrate them reliably before giving up the resources needed for 24/7 power .\nWe should listen to the engineers who run the grid as we embark on the clean energy transition .\nBut herein lies the rub .\nIn my years as an energy regulator , I witnessed a steady rise in regulation by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of influential energy think tanks and non-profits .\nOften this wishful thinking is expressed in the form of simplistic bumper-sticker sentiments like , \u201c we only need to harness the power of the markets , \u201d or \u201c we just need more transmission.\n\u201d Unfortunately , today \u2019 s electricity markets aren \u2019 t going to solve this problem .\nThe markets , as represented by Regional Transmission Organizations , have been stretched to the breaking point .\nThese are \u201c markets \u201d that would be unrecognizable to Adam Smith or Milton Friedman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandates , subsidies , and out-of-market payments to generators .\nThe result is incorrect price signals and the abandonment of resources needed to maintain reliability .\nAn electricity market that can not provide reliable service is a market that is broken .\nEspecially vulnerable have been nuclear units , the nation \u2019 s largest source of carbon-free on-demand power .\nAs for transmission , it \u2019 s likely part of a long-term solution ,

decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women \u2019 s Health Organization was a long-awaited victory for life .\nWhile Dobbs did not make abortion illegal , it did empower the residents of all 50 states to democratically determine abortion \u2019 s legal status through their elected representatives .\nCurrently , 22 states provide or will soon provide protection for unborn children .\nThe other 28 states place few or no limits on abortion .\nThe abortion battle will now move to the ballot box in each state .\nBut don \u2019 t fall for the deceptively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited to the political arena .\nAccording to a recent Harvard Harris poll , 72 % of Americans believe abortion should be illegal , or legal only with restrictions .\nThe Left is well aware that a majority of states will pass at least some abortion restrictions in the coming months .\nOn this issue , democracy is not their friend .\nSo , the Left is employing an autocratic means to impose its will \u2013 \u201c woke capitalism , \u201d sometimes referred to as \u201c stakeholder capitalism.\n\u201d These terms sound compelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ruse to conceal the Left \u2019 s disdain for the inconvenience of real democracy .\nWoke capitalism attempts to reorient modern corporations from their traditional responsibility to generate returns for investors to a new mission of supporting leftist political activism .\nThe Left has utilized this approach when advancing radical environmental policies , opposing Georgia \u2019 s voter-fraud protections , or challenging Florida \u2019 s law restricting instruction on gender identity and sexual orientation through the third grade .\nNow the Left is employing woke capitalism to advance its position on abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parenthood , America \u2019 s largest abortion provider , the Number One goal post-Dobbs is \u201c to get women where they need to be to access abortion.\n\u201d President Biden has signed an executive order pushing back against potential state efforts to limit a woman \u2019 s ability to cross state lines for an abortion .\nBiden \u2019 s executive order would protect the efforts of at least 60 U.S. corporations that have announced abortion travel benefits for employees unable to get abortions where they reside .\nThe monies to pay for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating expenses ( increasing investors \u2019 returns ) or to pay dividends .\nThese woke CEOs are not using their own money to fund this perk \u2013 they are using their investors \u2019 monies to advance policies that these investors may well oppose .\nThis is woke capitalism \u2019 s cornerstone : using other peoples \u2019 resources to advance political goals .\nThe list of companies providing such abortion benefits is not limited to those associated with the far Left , such as Starbucks , Patagonia , Google , Amazon , CNN , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irreparably woke Disney .\nIt also includes companies such as Kroger , Dick \u2019 s Sporting Goods , CVS drugstores , Mastercard , and Target .\nKeep these names in mind when you shop \u2013 and when you invest .\nYou may be unaware , though , that you have invested in these companies because your shares sit in a pension fund , mutual fund , 401k plan , or other investment product managed by fiduciaries tasked with prudently investing your money \u2013 not supporting some political agenda .\nBut major financial firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , Wells Fargo , Citigroup , and Bank of America have all joined the abortion perks bandwagon , and they are unlikely to object when companies divert corporate assets on behalf of causes that they also support .\nWoke CEOs claim that these policies benefit their businesses because they meet employees \u2019 needs .\nBut will they provide comparable benefits to employees facing crisis pregnancies who make the alternative choice \u2013 the choice for life ?\nHow about travel benefits for visiting crisis pregnancy centers if none are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they \u2019 ve been vandalized or firebombed ?\nIt \u2019 s striking that companies like Amazon and Starbucks , which claim to regard employees as \u201c stakeholders , \u201d are determined not to offend their workforce when it comes to abortion access but will risk offending those same employees by resisting their efforts to unionize .\nPerhaps these woke CEOs are actually more concerned about offending pro-abortion activists than supporting their workers .\nThe bottom line : conservative Americans can no longer conduct business as usual .\nThe radical Left now controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we \u2019 ve trusted in the past .\nOn the plus side , however , the free market will self-correct over time , rewarding investors who choose companies focused on profits rather than politics .\nIn the meantime

elected \u201d and to lobby for Chicago as the site of the party \u2019 s 2024 presidential convention .\nUnofficially , there was buzz that Pritzker could be a Democratic presidential nominee himself \u2013 in 2028 , or possibly sooner .\nThat same weekend , 47 people were shot in Chicago .\nThe Windy City \u2019 s weekend shootouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become hardly worth mentioning , in particular by the governor .\nChicago and Illinois have become synonymous with all the bad leftist policies that are failing in cities and states around the country .\nChicago leads the nation in \u201c mass \u201d shooting events , yet the governor of Illinois is often found traipsing out of state .\nAfter the mass shooting at the Fourth of July parade in Highland Park , Governor Pritzker finally had something to say .\nHe took to TV to say that he was \u201c furious , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed for a federal assault weapons ban .\nHe has yet to achieve a similar ban in Illinois , though Democrats control the state government from top to bottom .\nHe also hasn \u2019 t shown the same fury regarding the deaths happening every weekend in Chicago \u2013 and Chicagoans have noticed .\nRadio host Kimberly Egonmwan of 1690 AM , a radio station that \u201c chronicles the rich history of the Black experience , \u201d asked , \u201c Why is it not enough when it happens to us ?\n\u201d As Pritzker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state for cultivating the first potatoes during Colonial times , three kids under 18 were shot in Chicago in a span of five hours .\nA few days after the governor \u2019 s New Hampshire speech , Ken Griffin , Chicago \u2019 s wealthiest resident , announced that he and his Citadel firm would be departing Illinois .\nGriffin would be taking his talents to Miami .\nIt \u2019 s a familiar story by now .\nFirms from San Francisco and New York have been steadily making the move south over the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they held businesses hostage , that these firms could simply not pick up and move .\nThe pandemic proved them wrong .\nA recent Wall Street Journal article highlighted how red states have \u201c won \u201d the post-pandemic economy .\n\u201c Remote work allowed many workers to move to red states , not because of political preferences , but for financial and lifestyle reasons\u2014cheaper housing , better weather , less traffic and lower taxes , the analysts said.\n\u201d But those political preferences do matter .\nWe don \u2019 t have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in people making these moves , but it \u2019 s hard not to suspect that it figures into the equation .\nNormalcy during Covid was clearly a draw .\nFlorida had famously reopened , under the leadership of Governor Ron DeSantis , far earlier than any of the blue states .\nMuch of life had returned to normal there , and companies followed their employees as they sought out that freedom .\nWith this migration has come a serious shift in the state \u2019 s politics .\nPreviously a purple state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column .\nIn March , Fox News reported \u201c registered Republican voters now outnumber Democrats by over 100,000 for the first time in the state \u2019 s history.\n\u201d Crime as a factor is also under-examined .\nIt \u2019 s not that there is no crime in Florida in general , or in Miami specifically .\nOf course there is .\nBut there is a seriousness to Florida \u2019 s response that simply doesn \u2019 t exist in Illinois , New York , or California .\nWhile Pritzker talks about fantasy proposals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago bloodshed anyway , Governor DeSantis is focusing on crime-fighting , hiring away out-of-state officers , and raising police pay across the board .\nHis office touts how \u201c Governor DeSantis signed HB 3 , the strongest law enforcement recruitment and support initiative in the nation , into law.\n\u201d This week , DeSantis said \u201c We \u2019 re going to do even more for law enforcement \u2013 making sure that we remain a law-and-order state \u2013 and [ making sure ] that people know that we \u2019 re going to put people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like these other states where they release all the criminals on the streets .\nYou see how destructive that has been.\n\u201d Americans do see .\nDeSantis , for all the 2024 speculation about his candidacy , is also not trotting around New Hampshire complimenting their root vegetables .\nHe is laser-focused on making Florida better .\nThe big current concern in Florida is that the new arrivals will change the political landscape .\nFloridians are trying to preserve what they have gained over the last few years .\nThey worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong \u201d and disrupting their good thing .\nBut a firm like Citadel is a natural fit for a free-market state like Florida .\nThe $ 51 billion hedge fund was founded in Chicago after Griffin got his start at a Chicago-based firm .\nThe move to Florida , the Wall Street Journal observes , \u201c could also be a blow to Chicago \u2019 s philanthropic scene .\nMr. Griffin has given more than $ 600 million in gifts to educational , cultural , medical and civic organizations in the area.\n\u201d In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded wistful .\n\u201c Chicago has been a remarkable home for Citadel .\nI still remember the incredible civic pride and engagement when I arrived more than thirty years ago \u2013 and the outreach by business and political leaders who wanted us to succeed and be a part of the fabric of Chicago \u2019 s community.\n\u201d Here was an organization committed to its home city , but it found that that city , and the state , didn \u2019 t care about its needs .\nFlorida has been gaining , that \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida \u2019 s growth is best understood side-by-side with the stories of what blue states are losing .\nCitadel didn \u2019 t just drift away .\nIllinois pushed Citadel out the door .\n\u201c It was becoming increasingly difficult to recruit top talent from across the world to Chicago given the rising and senseless violence in the city , \u201d a source knowledgeable with the move told me .\n\u201c Talent wants to live in cities where it feels safe.\n\u201d The response from Illinois leadership was largely a shoulder shrug .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spokeswoman for Pritzker , who said that \u201c countless companies are choosing Illinois as their home.\n\u201d Are they , though ?\nThe press releases mostly show an exit .\nAccompanying Citadel out of the state is Caterpillar Inc. ( moving to Texas ) and Boeing Co.

migrators .\nPritzker has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no coincidence that he \u2019 s heading to the Leadership Blue Gala , an event held by Florida Democrats this weekend in Tampa .\nAs long as Ron DeSantis remains governor of Florida , governors of failing blue states will have to worry about people fleeing for the sunny locale .\nPritzker will go to Florida to try and stop that from happening .\nHe

energy prices , and interest rates are increasingly adding to inflationary woes .\nAnd much to the Biden administration \u2019 s chagrin , the $ 1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan is the largest driver of inflation .\nAdditionally , Democrats refuse to admit their push for Environmental , Social , and Governance ( ESG ) , especially in energy policy , in both the public and private sectors is also a major problem .\nAs more financial leaders scrutinize so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence suggesting ESG exacerbated the 9.1 % increase in the consumer price index .\nOf the three ESG prongs , the \u201c E \u201d factor\u2060\u2014which accounts for environmental stewardship and natural resources development in business practices\u2014is primarily contributing to inflation .\nSeema Shah , chief global strategist at Principal Global , calls this phenomenon \u201c greenflation.\n\u201d In fall 2021 , Shah warned how the push to transition away from fossil fuels , notably in the form of advancing net-zero policies , \u201c created a chain reaction resulting in higher energy prices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She also explained how \u201c en-flation \u201d ( environmental inflation ) is adding to uncertainty by way of carbon credits , harsh penalties for companies that fail to meet U.N. climate targets , and increased investment in technology along with research and development ( R & D ) , for instance .\nAmerican Petroleum Institute CEO Mike Sommers blamed the Biden administration \u2019 s \u201c misguided \u201d energy policies , namely their decarbonization push , for compounded inflationary pressures .\nUltimately , consumers will be burdened by \u201c en-flation \u201d as costs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University \u2019 s Lucas Toh explains the transition to 100 % wind and solar energy will be expensive , writing : \u201c The reality is that wind and solar are only cheap during the early stages of transition.\n\u201d Currently , states with existing renewable portfolio standards paid $ 125.2 billion more in electricity costs compared to states without them .\nSo much for fossil fuel divestments being lucrative .\nAs a result , some corporations are recommitting to oil and gas investments .\nEarlier this year , BlackRock , a devoted ESG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c E \u201d prong by supporting fossil fuel investments to not jeopardize business opportunities in Texas .\nThe \u201c social \u201d pillar contained in ESG argues a company \u2019 s attractiveness is determined by adopting social factors like Diversity , Equity and Inclusion ( DEI ) and addressing gender inequality .\nWith respect to hiring women , however , these companies are struggling to effectively recruit and retain female talent .\nWhy ?\nCompanies are more interested in preaching politics in the workplace than prioritizing their bottom line which is turning serious female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d pillar , companies can only achieve \u201c S \u201d if they spend copious amounts on recruitment and retention .\nThat , in itself , also fuels inflation .\nThis emphasis on social policies will further distract companies from attracting workers back to the office .\nAnd it will prove disastrous as more women exit the workforce .\nIt \u2019 ll be hard to lure back two million women who have checked out from traditional jobs .\nInstead , they are actively seeking freelancing options that provide more freedom to balance work-family life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages .\nCompanies will struggle to compete with flexible work options if they focus on social policy .\nMuch like \u201c E \u201d and \u201c S , \u201d the governance ( \u201c G \u201d ) factor of decision making in business will incur added costs to properly monitor , report , and implement initiatives and pledges .\nCore elements of \u201c G \u201d include purpose , board of directors , and shareholder rights .\nBut companies who claim to govern in accordance with sustainability investing may be gaming the system through ESG ratings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe S & P 500 ESG Index downgraded the electric vehicle company for failing to sufficiently decarbonize , despite net-zero policies guiding Tesla \u2019 s purpose and guiding principles .\nThis prompted Tesla CEO Elon Musk to label the ESG index \u201c a scam.\n\u201d A paradox emerges here : companies can deliberately game the system by pretending to adhere to the \u201c G \u201d by checking off boxes through virtue signaling instead of focusing on having an actual real-world impact .\nBarrons aptly described ESG investing like this : \u201c The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for investors or even society\u2014is that it is way too blunt a frame .\nAs it is currently conceived , ESG is at risk of becoming little more than a marketing slogan , destined to confuse , or be labeled \u2018 greenwashing.\n\u2019 \u201d Corporations and the federal government pushed and propped up ESG at their own peril .\nNow , consumers are reeling from the effects of these misguided

Manchin \u2019 s reversal on the energy-related provisions of the pending reconciliation bill .\nLast month , Manchin derailed the measure which included some $ 300 billion in energy-related provisions .\nManchin was pilloried by climate activists and by former Obama advisor , John Podesta , who declared that Manchin had \u201c single-handedly doomed humanity.\n\u201d But last Wednesday , Manchin switched his position and agreed to a deal with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer which has been dubiously dubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d The Manchin-Schumer deal shows , yet again , that the Washington Favor Factory never sleeps .\nThe 700-plus-page bill is filled with outrageously expensive subsidies for the solar and wind sectors and lavishes lollipops on nearly every energy-related special interest in Washington .\nThe legislation is so broad and has so much corporate welfare that it has been endorsed by \u2013 get this \u2013 Exxon Mobil and the Natural Resources Defense Council .\nOn Friday , Exxon CEO Darren Woods called the spending bill \u201c a step in the right direction\u2026We \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more comprehensive set of solutions \u201d is needed .\nA day earlier , Manish Bapna , president of NRDC issued a statement that said \u201c This is the ultimate clean energy comeback \u2014 the strongest climate action yet in the moment we need it most .\nCongress must pass it without delay.\n\u201d Exxon is cheering the provisions that could expand domestic drilling .\nThe NRDC is cheering because the bill includes tax credits for a myriad of alt-energy programs , including , of course , more tax credits for wind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill are expected to cost $ 369 billion .\nThat \u2019 s an increase of more than 20 % over the cost estimates published just a few weeks earlier .\n( Talk about inflation ! )\nAnd while the cost has been pegged at $ 369 billion , the final invoice for all of the measures in the bill could be far higher .\nThat brings me to my first point : the bill reveals ( again ) how perverted the parliamentary process in Congress has become .\nThis legislation will cost hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impacts on the economy .\nOne media outlet dubbed it \u201c the biggest and most consequential climate change bill ever passed by Congress.\n\u201d But key provisions in the legislation \u2014 including incentives for solar energy via the investment tax credit which author and Substack writer Michael Shellenberger recently estimated could total $ 260 billion \u2013 were never debated in Congress .\nThat \u2019 s remarkable .\nWhy ?\nThe ITC is the most-expensive energy-related provision in the federal tax code .\nLast year , solar energy got 267 times more in federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the nuclear sector did .\nNor any debate about another extension of the production tax credit , the subsidy used by the wind industry .\nThe PTC , which is the second-most-expensive energy-related provision in the federal tax code , expired at the beginning of this year .\nIt was designed as a \u201c temporary \u201d subsidy but it has been extended 13 times , and it has become the main financial incentive that is driving the growing land-use conflicts between the wind industry and towns and counties all across the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes , the subsidy for wind energy could , if certain conditions are met regarding domestically produced content , rise from the current 2.6 cents per kilowatt-hour to 3.1 cents per kilowatt-hour .\nThese subsidies for solar and wind are blatant examples of corporate welfare being handed out in the name of climate change .\nDespite staggering costs \u2013 and the deleterious impact that the wind and solar subsidies are having on the integrity of the electric grid \u2013 these handouts aren \u2019 t being debated .\nIndeed , the total cost and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being mentioned by big media outlets , perhaps because the language in the bill is so convoluted it takes an expert to understand what the legislation will do .\nCongress isn \u2019 t discussing any of these facts .\nInstead of debate and deliberation , all of these measures are being rushed through the reconciliation process that allows legislation to pass with just 51 votes in the Senate .\nManchin-Schumer reminds me of the 5,593-page Covid relief and spending bill that was approved by Congress in late 2020 .\nThe legislation was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Concha , a columnist for The Hill , dubbed it the \u201c swampiest thing ever.\n\u201d Concha added that it was \u201c exactly what one would expect from a dysfunctional , tone-deaf Congress : a pork-filled cluster\u2026 \u201d That \u2019 s what the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is : a pork-filled cluster .\nManchin and Schumer have

Italy , Holland , and others are rushing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they possibly can .\nOh , and by the way , the Newcastle coal benchmark now stands over $ 400 per ton .\nNineteen months ago it was selling for $ 50 per ton .\nFinally , be wary of the claims about how world-changing and climate-saving the deal will be .\nA one-page summary of the deal published by Senate Democrats claimed it \u201c lowers energy costs , increases cleaner production , and reduces carbon emissions by roughly 40 percent by 2030.\n\u201d That last claim was dutifully reported by the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Times said the deal will \u201c put the United States on track to slash its greenhouse gas emissions to roughly 40 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.\n\u201d Let \u2019 s look at the numbers .\nIn 2005 , US emissions totaled some 5.9 billion tons .\nBetween 2005 and 2021 , those emissions declined by about 20 percent , or roughly 1.2 billion tons .\nThus , to slash emissions by another 20 percent \u2014 and do so in just eight years \u2014 will require cutting another 1.2 billion tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s nearly equal to all of the energy-related emissions from U.S. industry in 2021 .\n( According to the EPA , industrial emissions last year totaled 1.4 billion tons . )\nPut another way , cutting that much emissions would require cutting domestic oil use by more than half .\n( Last year , oil-related emissions totaled 2.2 billion tons . )\nCall me a skeptic , but that will not happen .\nFurthermore , as Shellenberger has reported , the Joint Committee on Taxation determined that the Manchin-Schumer bill will raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Americans earning below $ 200,000 per year than on Americans earning between $ 200,000 and $ 500,000 per year.\n\u201d In addition , Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema reportedly wants changes in the bill .\nThe Wall Street Journal cited one investment firm that \u201c put the chance of the deal \u2019 s passage at just 65 percent , saying that among other risks , progressives may not agree to permitting overhauls that help boost fossil-fuel production.\n\u201d In short , this deal may be a long way from becoming law .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it shows again that the Washington Swamp will always deliver to special interests .\n__________ Robert Bryce is the host of the \u201c Power Hungry Podcast , \u201d executive producer of the documentary , \u201c Juice : How Electricity Explains the World , \u201d and the author of six books , including most recently , \u201c A Question of Power : Electricity and the Wealth of Nations.\n\u201d Follow him on Twitter : @ pwrhungry", "author": "Deneen Borelli", "url": "https://deneenborelli.com/2022/08/commentary-manchin-schumer-energy-deal-proves-the-power-of-the-swamp/", "published": "Fri, 05 Aug 2022 18:37:01 +0000", "published_utc": 1659739021, "collection_utc": 1659738323}, {"id": "deneenborelli--2022-07-30--Video: Peter Sherr about his run for State Representative in Connecticut\u2019s 151st District", "date": "2022-07-30", "source": "deneenborelli", "title": "Video: Peter Sherr about his run for State Representative in Connecticut\u2019s 151st District", "content": "Peter Sherr joins Reigniting Liberty with host Deneen Borelli about his run for State Representative in Connecticut \u2019 s 151st @ @", "author": "Deneen Borelli", "url": "https://deneenborelli.com/2022/07/video-peter-sherr-about-his-run-for-state-representative-in-connecticuts-151st-district/", "published": "Sat, 30 Jul 2022 12:22:51 +0000", "published_utc": 1659198171, "collection_utc": 1659738323}, {"id": "deneenborelli--2022-08-08--Video: Lying Biden Sics 87,000 IRS Agents on Americans", "date": "2022-08-08", "source": "deneenborelli", "title": "Video: Lying Biden Sics 87,000 IRS Agents on Americans", "content": "Biden \u2019 s Inflation Reduction Act sics 87,000 new IRS agents on Americans is discussed on this episode of Reigniting @ @ @ @ @ Deneen Borelli and Newsmax TV contributor Dr. Tom Borelli delivering the truth in black and @ @", "author": "Deneen Borelli", "url": "https://deneenborelli.com/2022/08/video-lying-biden-sics-87000-irs-agents-on-americans/", "published": "Mon, 08 Aug 2022 12:56:48 +0000", "published_utc": 1659977808, "collection_utc": 1659997465}, {"id": "deneenborelli--2022-08-08--Podcast: Investigation Fauci\u2019s Finances", "date": "2022-08-08", "source": "deneenborelli", "title": "Podcast: Investigation Fauci\u2019s Finances", "content": "Discussing Fauci \u2019 s salary and possible conflicts of interest on CloutHub Reigniting Liberty channel with Fox News contributor Deneen @ @ @ @ @ Tom Borelli and guest Adam Andrzejewski , CEO & Founder of OpentheBooks.com .\nListen here @ @ @ @ @ subscribe to our Reigniting Liberty podcast here .", "author": "Deneen Borelli", "url": "https://deneenborelli.com/2022/08/podcast-investigation-faucis-finances/", "published": "Mon, 08 Aug 2022 12:40:17 +0000", "published_utc": 1659976817, "collection_utc": 1659997466}, {"id": "deneenborelli--2022-08-10--Podcast: Lying Biden Sics 87,000 IRS Agents on Americans", "date": "2022-08-10", "source": "deneenborelli", "title": "Podcast: Lying Biden Sics 87,000 IRS Agents on Americans", "content": "Biden \u2019 s Inflation Reduction Act sics 87,000 new IRS agents on Americans is discussed on this episode of Reigniting @ @ @ @ @ Deneen Borelli and Newsmax TV contributor Dr. Tom Borelli delivering the truth in black and @ @ @ @ @ Also sign up and subscribe to our Reigniting Liberty podcast here .", "author": "Deneen Borelli", "url": "https://deneenborelli.com/2022/08/podcast-lying-biden-sics-87000-irs-agents-on-americans/", "published": "Wed, 10 Aug 2022 14:45:49 +0000", "published_utc": 1660157149, "collection_utc": 1660170237}, {"id": "deneenborelli--2022-08-11--Commentary: Trump Raid Is More Democrat Gaslighting", "date": "2022-08-11", "source": "deneenborelli", "title": "Commentary: Trump Raid Is More Democrat Gaslighting", "content": "As I watched coverage of the raid on former President Trump \u2019 s Florida home on Monday , I recalled the moment I woke up to the gaslighting game Democrats were playing .\nIt was during the summer of 2018 when I saw Lanny Davis serving as Michael Cohen \u2019 s lawyer .\nAs the crooked Cohen tried to peddle himself as a fearless truthteller in the effort to take down his former employer , Donald Trump , the president \u2019 s enemies could have connected him with any number of skilled Beltway attorneys .\nInstead , the man derided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one of Bill and Hillary Clinton \u2019 s longtime apparatchiks .\nAt first , I thought this was a stupid move ;

direct phone call to arrange an interview .\nAs Comey later told a reporter , it was \u201c something I probably wouldn \u2019 t have done or maybe gotten away with in a more \u2026 organized administration.\n\u201d What about the FBI \u2019 s abuse of Carter Page and George Papadopoulos ?\nThe agency made up evidence in support of subpoenas , FISA warrants , whatever it took to get the desired result .\nWhat about the FBI and Department of Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic terrorists \u201d because they demanded that their elected representatives actually represent them ?\nWhat about the unilateral rescission of executive privilege and attorney-client privilege wherever it would have protected President Trump and his advisers ?\nThe purpose of all of this activity , along with the raid at Mar-a-Lago , was to intimidate not just Trump , but also his supporters .\nAnyone other than Donald Trump would have given up long ago .\nWho could possibly withstand the power of the state marshaled against you for six long years \u2013 through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through relentless persecution of your children and your friends and family ?\nFinally , what about the double standard that

about the FBI agents who lied repeatedly during the Trump-Russia investigation , sometimes under oath .\nEven more stunning has been the FBI \u2019 s monumental failure to investigate presidential son

and we aren \u2019 t afraid to come for you.\n\u201d They even rifled through Melania Trump \u2019 s closet , as if she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat box .\nWhen do we find out they also spent an hour

from one year ago , forcing poor , elderly and middle-class Americans to confront harsh realities to pay for necessities .\nToday , it costs 12.2 % more to put food on the table at home , about 60 % more to drive to work and 2.8 % more to take public transit than it did just last year .\nFamilies are turning to food banks for help in unprecedented numbers , with donors and foundations rising to meet the challenge .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape the corrosive impacts of inflation .\nIn this land of plenty , 2022 may be the hungriest summer on record for Americans up and down the income scale .\nAccording to Feeding America , 53 million people turned to food banks , food pantries and meal programs in 2021 , one-third more than prior to the COVID-19 pandemic , when millions of Americans

income ladder .\nIn turn , they depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet those needs .\nYet these frontline aid workers are also being squeezed by inflation from different directions .\nSadly , inflation is allowing givers no rest .\nRising food and gasoline prices make it costlier to deliver goods and services .\nFor example , in California , the Alameda County Community Food Bank \u2019 s expenditures jumped from a pre-pandemic monthly average of $ 250,000 to as high as $ 1.5 million .\nSupply chain disruptions that plagued our economy still persist as well , prompting organizations to find ways around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rationing on staples like meat .\nWages are rising , but this benefit \u2013 although good for workers \u2013 places greater pressure on nonprofit budgets .\nOrganizations must offer their employees more money to stave off staff departures , especially in a jobs market with over 11 million unfilled positions .\nEvery additional dollar allotted for salary is a dollar less for services .\nIn the meantime , inflation threatens to impact overall giving to charity as well .\nThe generosity of the American people has been a stopgap for surging demand during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ megagifts by wealthy donors attract headlines , they only account for about 5 % of individuals giving to our charitable sector .\nIn fact , giving is actually a part of life for Americans of all walks

0.7 % when adjusted for inflation .\nThis represents two thirds of overall giving to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society \u2013 from churches to soup kitchens to research institutes .\nUnfortunately , rising prices reduce the value of each dollar donated , eroding donors \u2019 giving power .\nEven more concerning , giving levels could cool over the uncertainty of inflation .\nLevels of consumption seem to be leveling off and Americans are dipping into their savings to just maintain their quality of life .\nA pullback in giving now would have devastating consequences : leaving nonprofits with fewer resources and hungry bellies empty .\nAmericans came together during a once-in-a-generation pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must come together again to help each other weather these current economic headwinds .\nIf you are uncertain about where to give , helping local food banks and pantries would be a good place to start .\n__________ Patrice Onwuka is adjunct senior fellow at The Philanthropy

in federal student debt , President Biden looked over his shoulder to answer a question : Was this debt forgiveness fair to those who had sacrificed and saved to pay their way through college ?\nBiden deflected .\n\u201c Is it fair to people who , in fact , do not own multibillion dollar businesses , \u201d he replied .\n\u201c Some of these guys want to give them all tax breaks , \u201d he said , seemingly referring to unrelated Republican tax proposals .\n\u201c Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporter .\n\u201c What do you think ?\n\u201d Then , the president left .\nThe fundamental question of fairness , however , remains as millions of Americans now search the Department of Education \u2019 s website for guidance to see if they qualify for loan forgiveness .\nOr if they would have qualified had they not repaid their loans earlier .\nAccording to the plan , the White House will cancel $ 10,000 in federal student debt loans for any individual making less than $ 125,000 a year and $ 20,000 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained that the debt amnesty was \u201c a slap in the face to working Americans.\n\u201d For many working in Washington , D.C. , however , it was a sigh of relief .\nStudent debt forgiveness is personal for the Biden administration .\nAbout one in five of the White House aides required to file a financial disclosure , as Bloomberg News previously noted , reported owing student debt .\nCollectively , those 30 senior White House staffers owe as much as $ 4.7 million .\nThose personal finances are not unusual in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more outstanding student debt in Washington than in any other city in the country .\nThe average debtor in D.C. , according to a 2021 breakdown by the small business analyst , AdvisorSmith , owes $ 54,982 in unpaid student loans .\nThis includes many political staffers at the Department of Education , senior advisors as well as junior aides who moved to that agency from the Biden campaign .\nAnalysis of financial disclosures by the conservative-leaning American Accountability Foundation found that the political staff at the agency that oversees the student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstanding student loan debt balance among 41 education staffers evaluated could amount to between $ 2.8 and $ 6.5 million .\nAccording to the AAF estimate obtained by RealClearPolitics , the president may have wiped away as much as $ 512,646 of their debt .\nMore than 45 million Americans owe $ 1.6 trillion in federal student debt , a balance that the New York Times reports dwarfs what they owe in car loans , credit cards , and other consumer debt .\nThe White House insists that the administration \u2019 s plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular , with 90 % of relief going to earners who make less than $ 75,000 a year .\nAs many as 43 million people can benefit , according to an administration infographic , and 20 million people \u201c can have their loans fully cancelled.\n\u201d It is precisely the kind of relief , Biden said , that the country needs post-pandemic .\n\u201c All of this means people can start finally to climb out from under that mountain of debt , \u201d the president said .\n\u201c To finally think about buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting a business .\nAnd by the way , when this happens the whole economy is better off.\n\u201d Mitch McConnell called it \u201c student loan socialism.\n\u201d The Republican Senate minority leader accused the president of delivering \u201c a slap in the face to every family who sacrificed to save for college , every graduate who paid their debt , and every American who chose a certain career path or volunteered to serve in our Armed Forces in order to avoid taking on debt .\nThis policy is astonishingly unfair.\n\u201d Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of AAF pointed to the \u201c windfall \u201d that political employees at the Education Department were set to receive , calling it \u201c shameful \u201d evidence of \u201c the gap between the people and the ruling class in Washington , D.C. \u201d Press spokesmen for the department did not respond to RCP requests for comment .\nSusan Rice dismissed gripes about fairness as \u201c inaccurate \u201d and part of a \u201c double standard.\n\u201d The director of the White House domestic policy council , previously a visiting fellow at Harvard , an institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , told reporters that \u201c Republicans didn \u2019 t complain when certain small businesses during the pandemic got extraordinary financial relief without having to pay back those loans.\n\u201d The forgiven federal loans in question , from student loans and from the pandemic , were part of the same principle .\nRice said it \u201c is fantastic \u201d that some individuals were able to repay their loans already , but \u201c that doesn \u2019 t mean that because some people were able to do so , nobody should help those that weren \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wouldn \u2019 t help anybody in this country.\n\u201d Democrats repeatedly met Republican criticism with the same rebuttal : What about the GOP tax cut ?\nBut criticism wasn \u2019 t just coming from the right .\nJason Furman , the chairman of Barack Obama \u2019 s White House Council of Economic Advisors , accused Biden of \u201c recklessly \u201d pouring \u201c gasoline on the inflationary fire that is already burning.\n\u201d \u201c Doing it while going well beyond one campaign promise ( $ 10K of student loan relief ) and breaking another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even worse , \u201d Furman tweeted .\nThe White House was eager to highlight the sympathetic cases on Wednesday , the \u201c typical nurse \u201d who brings home $ 77,000 a year and the \u201c typical construction worker \u201d who makes $ 38,000 .\n\u201c But then why design a policy that would provide up to $ 40,000 to a married couple making $ 249,000 , \u201d Furman asked .\nWhen RealClearPolitics asked Bharat Ramamurti if forgiving a portion of the federal debt owed by law school and business school graduates was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d the deputy director of the president \u2019 s National Economic Council replied , \u201c Yeah , it is.\n\u201d \u201c As we \u2019 ve made clear , nobody in the top 5 % of incomes is going to get a single dollar under this proposal , \u201d he said , adding that the administration had \u201c good data \u201d that high earners \u201c near the top of the income cutoff are much more likely to be experiencing distress after repayment starts.\n\u201d Ramamurti again compared Democrat debt amnesty to the Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reverse , \u201d he told RCP , where \u201c 15 % of the benefits went to people making under $ 75,000 a year , and 85 % went to people making over $ 75,000 a year.\n\u201d Education Secretary Miguel Cardona insisted that the aim of Biden \u2019 s executive action was to provide pandemic relief .\n\u201c Speaking to the fairness question , \u201d he told Fox News , student debt relief was no different than pandemic small business loans .\n\u201c It \u2019 s about making sure we \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our economy and in our people.\n\u201d \u201c But the people that already paid their student loans , they don \u2019 t get anything out of this deal , \u201d asked Peter Doocy .", "author": "Deneen Borelli", "url": "https://deneenborelli.com/2022/08/commentary-biden-student-loan-amnesty-a-windfall-for-dc-staffers/", "published":

"source": "deneenborelli", "title": "Commentary: Progressives Talk Loudly and Carry a Big Stick", "content": "This is the era of poke-the-bear politics .\nProgressives wield the stick , continually prodding America \u2019 s body politic by insisting on the self-evident truth of dubious claims : America is irredeemably racist !\nMasculinity is toxic !\nMen can have babies !\nWhen people , predictably , rise up in anger at the demand that they accept these notions , the left makes their response the story by casting legitimate criticism as violent threats to the Republic .\nThe strategy may be disgraceful , but it \u2019 s also genius .\nIt switches attention from their controversial claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous response , focusing attention on their opponents while giving their often-false ideas time to become entrenched .\nFor instance , when parents complained about far-left ideas regarding race and gender being taught to even the youngest children , the DOJ announced last October that federal officials would be monitoring their behavior for fears of nonexistent violence .\nThe latest poke occurred on Aug. 8 , when armed federal agents raided Donald Trump \u2019 s Florida home to retrieve government records .\nThe move was unprecedented \u2013 no former president had ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we concede that Trump was unwise to take classified material , the operation was unnecessary .\nTrump was cooperating with the National Archives about returning documents , and some legal analysts say the Presidential Records Act is so ambiguous that he may have been entitled to keep them .\nAnd , unlike Hillary Clinton \u2019 s storage of classified material on a private server that could easily be hacked by foreign enemies , Trump kept the physical documents under lock and key .\nGiven Trump \u2019 s flash-point status in our deeply divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bogus efforts to take him down , it was an intentionally incendiary move .\nIn response to the expected outrage , the Biden administration poked again , leaking unconfirmed reports to water-carrying reporters that Trump held unspecified \u201c nuclear secrets \u201d \u2013 let \u2019 s be honest , there are nuclear secrets and then there are nuclear secrets .\nIt also unloosed the outrageous suggestion that he might be selling secrets to our enemies by noting that he could be charged under the Espionage Act .\nWhile broadcasting these mistruths , mainstream news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s claim that he had exercised his rightful authority to declassify the material he took with him \u2013 which would have rendered moot any law enforcement justification for the raid .\nThey also ignored their own previous complaints about the government \u2019 s infamous penchant for classifying often innocuous information to advance the idea that every document marked top secret is akin to the launch codes .\nAs they issued such bad-faith arguments , Democrats and their media allies demanded that the public see this police state action aimed at kneecapping their chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rule of law .\nThey also tried to change the narrative by focusing on the anger their outrageous action had stoked .\nJust one day after the raid , the Washington Post reported that \u201c The simmering threat of violence comes to fore with search of Trump property.\n\u201d Two days later , FBI chief Christopher Wray gave away the game by channeling Hillary Clinton in warning that unnamed \u201c deplorable and dangerous \u201d figures on social media posed a threat to law enforcement .\nOne apparent Trump supporter did , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an FBI office in Cincinnati , and he was later killed by police for this criminal act .\nBut there is no evidence of meaningful violence .\nPoking the bear has been the hallmark of progressive politics since Trump emerged on the scene in 2015 .\nFor years they advanced the lie concocted by Hillary \u2019 s campaign that the president had conspired with Vladimir Putin to steal the 2016 election .\nShortly after that smear was exposed , they tried to impeach him for simply asking the Ukrainian president to look into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there \u2013 is it just a coincidence that the FBI raid came after prime-time hearings on the Jan. 6 riot failed to move the needle in the Democrats \u2019 direction ?\nSuch treatment enraged Trump , who lashed out at his tormentors on social media .\nAccording to plan , his inflammatory comments and tweets then became the story rather than the gross mistreatment he endured .\nIt also angered millions of Americans who had elected him because of their frustration with Washington .\nIn response , powerful media outlets portrayed them \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey turbo-charged this narrative following George Floyd \u2019 s murder and the rise of Black Lives Matter to delegitimize the right .\nAs city blocks burned , violent crime soared , and looting became an everyday occurrence in cities where progressive prosecutors worked to decriminalize crime , progressives claimed the nation \u2019 s greatest threat was white supremacist terror .\nWhen , at last , a group of Trump supporters , perhaps convinced that violence was now an acceptable form of \u201c peaceful protest , \u201d took the bait on Jan. 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poked bear is a danger .\nWhat followed was an unending stream of warnings from the Biden administration and useful idiot intellectuals that tens of millions of Republicans were preparing to instigate \u201c mass violence.\n\u201d The news reveals this to be palpable nonsense .\nIt is , in fact , the Big Lie eating away at our Republic .\nAsk yourself : when Americans step onto the street , are they afraid that Trump supporters might rob or kill them ?\nWhen we post edgy claims on Twitter , are we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin us ?\nBut it is an effective lie .\nAs they pursue cultural and economic policies at odds with reality , progressives know that their best hope of maintaining is to delegitimize their opponent .\nYou may not like us , but you can \u2019 t support those violent , theocratic racists .\nThey will keep poking the bear until the voters take away their stick .\n__________ J.

history teachers across the United States are struggling to navigate the battles of our ideologically charged landscape .\nThey are looking for resources free of partisan politics that they can use to teach the principles and practices of self-government to the next generation of Americans .\nIn light of these circumstances , RealClearFoundation , a nonprofit organization working in partnership with RealClearPolitics , today announces the launch of the Teacher Resources for American Civics web portal , a new , free resource .\n\u201c RealClear is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opinion on one page , and now we \u2019 re providing the same kind of curated , one-stop resource for students and teachers of American civics , \u201d said RealClearPolitics publisher David DesRosiers .\n\u201c In a nation based upon citizen self-government , recovering the American \u2018 unum \u2019 can only be accomplished through a revival of civic education.\n\u201d This interactive online portal was developed from the Roadmap to Educating for American Democracy ( EAD ) , a framework for civic education , and was carefully curated by Jack Miller Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comprehensive library of content specifically designed to aid teachers in bringing the American story to life in their classrooms .\nIt provides teachers with the resources to educate their students about the civic ties that should bind all Americans together , regardless of race , religion , national origin , or political persuasion .\n\u201c The K-12 civics teacher portal will be my go-to classroom resource this year and into the future , \u201d said Pucci , who teaches eighth-grade U.S. history at Manatee School for the Arts in Palmetto , Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about teachers enough to provide these stellar resources so that we can educate our students to understand , appreciate , and respect the core principles of our great nation.\n\u201d The new portal highlights seven crucial themes in American civics : civic participation , United States geography , \u201c We the People , \u201d government under the Constitution , American refoundings , America \u2019 s role in the world , and contemporary debates in American culture .\nEach theme portal features a library of materials that includes essential articles , primary and secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and visual and audio content .\n\u201c The portal not only provides me with key primary texts and lesson plans , \u201d Pucci notes , \u201c but the folks at RealClear have also provided expert commentary and secondary sources to help me go deeper and better understand the impact of these texts on the development of our nation .\nWhat \u2019 s even better is that the supporting material is drawn from recognized scholars and is worth its weight in gold.\n\u201d Leading the group of scholars Pucci mentions are Paul Carrese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civic and Economic Thought and Leadership at Arizona State University .\nThey provided explanatory essays for the new portal and were also instrumental in the EAD Roadmap \u2019 s creation .\n\u201c RealClear \u2019 s Teacher Resources for American Civics and the EAD Roadmap stake out the common ground that should unite all Americans despite our many differences , \u201d says Seagrave .\n\u201c Civic engagement should aim to build up , not to destroy .\nThe work of building requires knowledge , not just power ; and it is the knowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foster among all Americans.\n\u201d Each portal features a link to one of five design challenges from the EAD Roadmap , which Carrese notes are \u201c embedded across the themes \u201d in order to help teachers \u201c develop their own particular curricula and lessons.\n\u201d Created as a content framework for the purpose of improving American history and civics education , the Roadmap was a product of a 20-month collaborative process between members of Educating for American Democracy , a cross-ideological coalition of over 300 scholars , educators , students , and administrators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humanities and the Department of Education .\nRealClearFoundation is a member of this initiative .\nFollowing the mission of RealClear \u2019 s American Civics portal , this new resource does not shy away from telling a full account of America \u2019 s history , warts and all .\nBut it does this in the context of the principles of liberty and equality on which our nation was founded .\n\u201c It is important that American identity include both honesty about our nation \u2019 s failings as well as optimism derived from our nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c The civics teacher portal and the EAD Roadmap reflect this \u2018 both/and \u2019 approach , offering tremendous resources for maintaining the delicate honesty/optimism balance necessary for passing a healthy American identity on to future generations.\n\u201d Teachers , along with students and parents , will benefit from this new resource as they help recover a thoughtful , hopeful , and ultimately patriotic understanding of the American story .\n__________ Mike Sabo is the editor of RealClear \u2019 s American Civics portal .", "author":

Misconceptions About Charter Schools", "content": "Commentary by Walter Meyers III originally published by RealClearEducation.com and RealClearWire.com Since their humble beginnings in 1992 , with City Academy in St. Paul , Minnesota , charter schools have expanded to forty-four other states as well as the District of Columbia , and they now enroll well over 3.4 million students \u2013 roughly eight percent of all students nationwide .\nBut while charter schools have been around for thirty years , many Americans remain unfamiliar with or confused about the basic concept .\nWhat many don \u2019 t understand is that charter schools are public schools \u2013 funded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run .\nCharters serve as an alternative to public schools that often fail students , as is the case in virtually every major urban area with predominantly minority children .\nIn many cases , charters deliver significantly better educational outcomes than public schools in terms of standardized test scores and graduation rates .\nThe advantage of charter schools is that they are exempt from state and local regulations to a substantial degree , giving them the flexibility and autonomy to innovate and meet the needs of students .\nIn exchange for this freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their charter \u2013 generally a legislative contract with their state or district .\nCharter schools are reviewed periodically by their granting entity ; if the conditions of the charter aren \u2019 t met , their authorization can be revoked .\nA common misconception about charter schools is that they siphon off the best students from public schools and leave the remaining students to suffer in underperforming schools .\nThis isn \u2019 t the case , however : charter school admission is based on an open lottery system , which provides equal access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached .\nIt \u2019 s true that parents who are more involved in their children \u2019 s education will be more likely to pursue enrollment in a charter school , but their chances for success are the same as all other parents who apply .\nSome charters schools choose to serve more specifically the needs of their communities .\nCharter schools can prioritize admissions to students who live in the district they serve , for example .\nOther charters indicate specific missions .\nThe HOLLA School in the Rockwood Community of Portland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mission is to serve \u201c Black , Brown and Indigenous youth.\n\u201d Another common misconception about charter schools is that they drain money from traditional public schools .\nIn most states , adjustments are made to compensate districts for enrollment losses to charter schools .\nAnd besides , the mission of charter schools has always been to provide an alternative within the public school system itself \u2013 often a sorely needed alternative , considering the one-size-fits-all approach typical of traditional public school systems .\nCharter schools are no panacea .\nNot all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcomes , and not all are right for all students .\nAs with any schooling decision , parents must determine what is best for their children .\nRather than a competitor to traditional public schools , charters are more of a model for how public school systems could be more responsive to student needs , while also producing better outcomes .\nSince they can lose their authorization if they don \u2019 t effectively serve their students , charters are accountable in ways that traditional public schools , even failing ones , are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a charter school alternative to their under-performing local public school , but in some states limit parental options .\nIn California , teacher unions make huge campaign contributions to legislators who cripple charter schools by imposing onerous regulations and giving them considerably less funding than traditional public schools .\nIn California \u2013 where teachers get tenure after two years , pay increases are automatic regardless of performance , and full pension benefits start at age 62 \u2013 little incentive exists to innovate .\nCharter schools , by contrast , attract teachers who favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classroom , and retirement plans that resemble those of other private entities .\nThe truth is , charter schools do more with less , outperforming their traditional public school counterparts .\nIf traditional public schools want to retain students , instead of complaining they should learn from successful charter schools and seek to raise the quality of education they provide so that parents won \u2019 t need to seek alternatives .\nUntil that happens , concerned parents will continue to support charter schools .\n__________ By Walter Meyers III \u2013 This article

claimed : \u201c This whole concept that a good guy with a gun will stop the bad guys with a gun , it doesn \u2019 t hold up .\nAnd the data bears this out , so that theory is over.\n\u201d At the same press conference , New York City Mayor Eric Adams warned that more concealed carry permits might lead to an increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times Square remains a gun-free zone for permit holders .\nThis is a typical response from Democrats .\nAfter each mass public shooting , Democratic elected officials push for more gun control .\nThey ignore examples , even those that generated significant public attention , in which armed bystanders saved many lives .\nThey also disregard a grim aspect of such crimes : Most mass shooters want to commit suicide in a way that will gain the most media coverage .\nThe more people they kill , the more coverage they will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy , but they are rational enough to realize that they can kill more people if their victims are defenseless .\nLike so many other mass public shooters , the Buffalo shooter wrote in his manifesto : \u201c Areas where CCW permits are low may also be good areas of attack.\n\u201d The national media refuses to report other explicit statements by attackers .\nNor do they report the fact that 94 % of mass public shootings occur in places where civilians are banned from having guns .\nSurveys show that criminologists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies for stopping mass public shootings .\nOn a 1-to-10 scale , American criminologists rated the following policies most highly : Allow K-12 teachers to carry concealed handguns ( 6.0 ) , allow military personnel to carry on military bases ( 5.6 ) , encourage the elimination of gun-free zones ( 5.3 ) , and relax federal regulations that pressure companies to create gun-free zones ( 5.0 ) .\nThe top four policies for economists were the same , but in a different order : Encourage the elimination of gun-free zones ( 7.9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies to create gun-free zones ( 7.8 ) , allow K-12 teachers to carry concealed handguns ( 7.7 ) , and allow military personnel to carry on military bases ( 7.7 ) .\nAs important as police are to fighting crime , increased policing didn \u2019 t make the top of the list .\nThat \u2019 s because stopping mass public shootings is a uniquely difficult challenge .\nFor police , wearing a uniform is often akin to wearing a neon sign saying , \u201c Shoot me first.\n\u201d That makes officers easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concealed carry is that the attackers won \u2019 t know who is a threat to them .\n\u201c A deputy in uniform has an extremely difficult job in stopping these attacks , \u201d said Sarasota County , Florida , Sheriff Kurt Hoffman .\n\u201c These terrorists have huge strategic advantages in determining the time and place of attacks .\nThey can wait for a deputy to leave the area , or pick an undefended location .\nEven when police or deputies are in the right place at the right time , those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards may as well be holding up neon signs saying , \u2018 Shoot me first.\n\u2019 My deputies know that we can not be everywhere.\n\u201d Given how infrequently the news media covers defensive gun uses , it isn \u2019 t surprising that Gov .\nHochul believes that defensive gun uses are rare .\nBut survey estimates show on average that Americans use guns defensively about 2 million times a year .\nAccording to academic estimates , defensive gun uses \u2013 including instances when guns are simply shown to deter a crime \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than gun crimes .\nHochul also worries about permit holders themselves committing crime , but her fears are misplaced .\nNew York doesn \u2019 t provide data on the rate at which permit holders have their permits revoked , but we do have that data for other states .\nIn the 19 states with comprehensive data , the average revocation rate for any reason is one-tenth of 1 % .\nTypically , permit revocations occur because someone moved , died , or forgot to bring a permit while carrying .\nIn Florida and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firearms-related violations at one-twelfth the rate of police officers .\nThe governor might also be surprised to learn that the general public disagrees with her .\nAn early July survey by the Trafalgar Group showed a plurality of American general election voters believe that armed citizens are the most effective element in protecting you and your family in the case of a mass shooting .\nFirst on the list was \u201c armed citizens \u201d at 42 % , followed by \u201c local police \u201d ( 25 % ) and

RealClearEnergy.org and RealClearWire.com More than 80 % of global GDP is covered by national net-zero targets .\nStrip away the hype , and net zero emerges as a project that the West is foisting on the rest of the world .\nClimate commitments of the fastest-growing emitters are worth little more than the paper they \u2019 re written on .\nIf only strong commitments and clear plans are included , the number shrinks from 80 % to 10 % of global GDP , according to Oxford University \u2019 s Net Zero Tracker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States .\nIts net-zero target is not written into law , and its net-zero plan is deemed incomplete and lacking formal accountability .\nNonetheless , the war on fossil fuels is taking a heavy toll\u2014both on the West , which initiated hostilities , and on the billions of the world \u2019 s energy-poor .\nA major front in this war is the West \u2019 s investment embargo on oil , gas , and coal production .\nThe outcome has been to turn a cyclical squeeze from the economic rebound from the Covid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the head of the world \u2019 s largest oil company , Aramco chief executive Amin Nasser , warning signs of an impending energy crisis have been flashing for the best part of a decade , years before Russia \u2019 s latest attack on Ukraine .\nBetween 2014 and 2021 , annual investment in oil and gas more than halved , from $ 700 billion to a little over $ 300 billion .\nIn short , the world is experiencing the first crisis of the energy transition .\nHighly damaging energy shocks will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues to prosecute its war on fossil fuels .\nYet for Vaclav Smil , author of How the World Really Works , and Alex Epstein , author of Fossil Future , there is little doubt about the eventual outcome : the West is going to lose this war , the biggest unknown being the losses that the West inflicts upon itself and on vulnerable non-belligerents , principally among them 1 billion energy-starved Africans .\nTheir two books could hardly be better timed ; as Smil puts it , \u201c crises expose realities.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Epstein are different , there is synchronicity between the two .\nBoth emphasize how fossil fuels multiply the effectiveness of human labor .\n\u201c An average inhabitant of the Earth nowadays has at their disposal nearly 700 times more useful energy than their ancestors had at the beginning of the 19th century , \u201d writes Smil in How the World Really Works .\nIn two centuries , the human labor to produce a kilogram of American wheat fell from ten minutes to less than two seconds .\nModern life is a product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for the time that fossil fuels free up , there would be no medical industry as we know it , \u201d Epstein writes in Fossil Future .\nThe conclusions of both are virtually interchangeable , Smil writing that society \u2019 s increasing dependence on fossil fuels is \u201c the most important factor in explaining the advances of modern civilization.\n\u201d Or , as Epstein puts it , posing a counterfactual of past elimination of fossil fuels and forgoing their uniquely ubiquitous benefits , \u201c we can be certain that rapid fossil fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people\u2014prematurely ending billions of lives , preventing the decrease of extreme poverty , and causing an incalculable amount of suffering.\n\u201d Climate and energy policy is systematically distorted by not evaluating the benefits of fossil fuels .\nAs Epstein points out , from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) on down , no advocate of net zero ever answers this question : In what year did the climate costs of fossil fuels overwhelm the benefits of using them ?\nAnswering it requires conceding that fossil fuels benefit humanity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross , and the central purpose of both books is placing the benefits of fossil fuels front and center .\nSmil and Epstein both recognize the threat of net zero to the welfare of the world \u2019 s poor .\nPer acre of agricultural land , Ethiopia uses one-eighth the amount of fertilizer that the EU uses .\nCutting emissions by cutting down on the amount of fertilizer might be an option for affluent countries , but , writes Smil , \u201c hundreds of millions of stunted children , mostly in Africa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more meat.\n\u201d It \u2019 s easier to stop something new than to slow something already under way , Epstein points out .\nThus , the West finds it easier to prevent fossil fuel development in Africa and indefinitely delay the world \u2019 s poorest places in freeing themselves from poverty than to slow down the economic development of India and China .\nSmil demolishes the idea that decarbonizing electricity generation eliminates dependence on fossil fuels .\nDespite the long-term trend toward electrification , electricity supplies 18 % of global energy consumption .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ into what Smil calls the four pillars of modern civilization : cement , steel , plastics , and ammonia .\nGlobal production of these accounts for 17 % of the world \u2019 s primary energy supply and globally accounts for 25 % of carbon dioxide emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels .\nSmil calls the Haber-Bosch process for synthesizing ammonia \u201c perhaps the most momentous technical advance in history , \u201d paving the way for widespread use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers that took off in the 1960s with the use of natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereby enabling the Green Revolution .\n\u201c The high yields produced with unprecedented low costs would be impossible without direct and indirect infusions of fossil energies , \u201d Smil writes .\n\u201c Without fossil fuels or their equivalent , \u201d Epstein observes , \u201c food production would collapse , \u201d a truth borne out by the unfolding humanitarian disaster in Sri Lanka caused by its government banning synthetic fertilizers at the behest of Western green activists .\nDescribing himself as neither a pessimist nor an optimist , but a scientist\u2014we \u2019 ll come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment\u2014Smil \u2019 s handling of the relevant history is second to none .\nA brief history of globalization starts from the Dutch expansion in the 17th century ( \u201c this was just an incipient , secretive , and limited globalization without any nationwide impacts \u201d ) ; the steam-powered , screw-propelled globalization of the late 19th century ; the advent of containerization in 1957 and the first shipments of Liquified Natural Gas ( LNG ) in the early 1960s through to the impact of the first energy crisis in 1973 .\nPost-1973 globalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade and altered its composition .\nBefore 1973 , oil and crude tanker traffic accounted for over half the transported total .\nBy 2018 , goods amounted to about 70 % .\nThe 1973\u201374 energy crisis is a major turning point in Smil \u2019 s narrative .\nIn inflation-adjusted terms , the world price of oil was lower in 1950 than it was in 1940 , lower in 1960 than in 1950 , and lower still in 1970 than in 1960 .\nOPEC more than quadrupling the price of oil brought to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the Marshall Plan gets credit for kick-starting Europe \u2019 s post-1945 economic recovery , the crucial role of cheap , abundant energy is neglected .\n\u201c It is hard to understand why modern economics , \u201d comments Smil , \u201c has largely ignored energy.\n\u201d The flexibility of energy markets in responding to higher oil prices undergirded a second 30-year global expansion , lifting more people out of poverty than ever before .\nThe Iranian revolution triggered a second oil-price spike , rising from $ 13 a barrel in 1978 to $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1986 , falling back to $ 13 .\nIn 1995 , crude oil extraction surpassed its 1978 record , but oil never regained its previous prominence , its share of primary energy supply falling from 45 % in 1970 to 38 % at the turn of the century .\nThe market dynamics following the two energy crises of the 1970s , triggered by war and revolution in the Middle East , are fundamentally different from the current one caused by the West \u2019 s war on fossil fuels .\nThis time , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from catastrophic climate change , so its very design creates energy shortages and structurally high prices .\nHere , Smil raises a question mark .\n\u201c Appraisals of the environment are perhaps even more prone to unwarranted generalization , biased interpretation , and outright misinformation than those of energy and food production , \u201d Smil says .\nGlobal climate change is extraordinarily complex .\n\u201c To believe that our understanding of these dynamic , multifactorial realities has reached the state of perfection is to mistake the science of global warming for the religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smil notes that those prophesying catastrophe in one form or another have been wrong time after time .\nEpstein comments that the climate impacts of carbon dioxide emissions are \u201c extremely hard for current science to accurately predict.\n\u201d He contrasts the failure of past predictions of catastrophe\u2014in 1986 , John Holdren , future science adviser to President Obama , had suggested that carbon dioxide\u2013induced climate famines could claim the lives of as many as a billion people before 2020\u2014with the 98 % reduction in climate-related fatalities since the 1920s .\nDifferences between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smil \u2019 s metrics to assess the future center on survivability\u2014breathing , drinking , and eating .\nEpstein \u2019 s metric is the advancement of human flourishing , which he defines as \u201c increasing the ability of human beings to live long , healthy , fulfilling lives.\n\u201d Smil \u2019 s metrics imply a constrained , minimalist conception of the human condition ; Epstein \u2019 s imply an expansionary , optimistic conception .\nCentral to Epstein \u2019 s case is the century-long precipitous fall in climate-related deaths , when carbon dioxide levels in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having more wealth generates the means of providing greater physical resilience against extreme weather\u2014what Epstein calls \u201c climate mastery.\n\u201d Using fossil fuels to generate wealth extends and deepens protection to billions of the world \u2019 s poor against a world that , in its primal state , is dangerous and inhospitable .\nIt is here that Epstein \u2019 s training as a philosopher comes to the fore .\nSmil takes as an objective datum the West \u2019 s elevation of man-made climate change as the preeminent global challenge of our times and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fossil fuels , pointing to the \u201c unmistakably increasing ( albeit not unanimous ) conviction that , of all the risks we face , global climate change is the one that needs to be tackled most urgently and effectively \u201d \u2014but does not question it .\nAs a scientist of ideas , Epstein explores the ideas and values that lie behind this conviction .\nThe principal idea of this belief system\u2014and let \u2019 s call it what it is : an ideology\u2014is that human impact on nature is intrinsically bad .\nThis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one that Epstein calls the \u201c delicate nurturer assumption.\n\u201d Absent human impact , Earth exists in an optimal , delicate balance , neatly summarized by Mufasa in The Lion King , when he tells Simba : \u201c Everything you see exists together in a delicate balance.\n\u201d This constitutes an antihuman standard of evaluation , Epstein argues , as its logic decrees that the world becomes a better place , the more that human impact is minimized .\n\u201c To have as our goal the elimination of human impact is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that human life requires.\n\u201d He cites anti\u2013fossil fuel activist Bill McKibben \u2019 s statement that the goal should be a humbler world where humans have less impact and where \u201c human happiness would be of secondary importance \u201d ; and biologist David Graber \u2019 s statement that until humanity decides to rejoin nature , whatever that means , the only hope for biocentrists like him and McKibben is for \u201c the right virus to come along.\n\u201d It is hard to overstate the long-term impact of these ideas in goading the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifty years ago , in the run-up to the first United Nations conference on the environment , in Stockholm , authors Barbara Ward and Ren\u00e9 Dubos wrote in \u201c Only One Earth \u201d that small changes in the planet \u2019 s balance of energy could change average temperatures by two degrees centigrade ; \u201c downwards , this is another ice age , upwards to an ice-free age .\nIn either case , the effects are global and catastrophic.\n\u201d Twenty years later , at the Rio Earth Summit , the idea that human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardwired into the United Nations Framework on Climate Change , which has the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations at a level to prevent \u201c dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\n\u201d Using a human flourishing standard , Epstein flips the framing .\n\u201c We want to avoid not \u2018 climate change \u2019 but \u2018 climate danger , \u2019 \u201d a formulation that has a pre-echo in the developing world \u2019 s pushback against ecologism in the debates ahead of the 1972 Stockholm conference on the environment .\nThe problem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UN , Miguel \u00c1lvaro Os\u00c3\u00b3rio de Almeida , declared , \u201c is not achieving an \u2018 ecological balance , \u2019 but , on the contrary , obtaining the most efficient forms of \u2018 long-term ecological imbalance.\n\u2019 The problem is not to exterminate mankind now , in the name of ecological equilibrium , but to prolong our ability to use natural resources for as long as possible.\n\u201d Based on that standard , there would be no war on fossil fuels .\nInstead , there would be renewed efforts to make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disagreement about climate change is not about data but about values .\nAs an ideology , environmentalism and its climate-change spawn are triumphant .\nTheir conquest of the West is almost total .\nTo oppose or even question it is to invite cancellation .\nThe absence of opposition led the West to adopt an extreme manifestation of this ideology in the form of net-zero targets that require their societies to be completely reorganized around the goal of the near-elimination of fossil fuels and the minimization of the use of materials\u2014Smil \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts of fossil fuels to make them .\nSmil \u2019 s book demonstrates that there is essentially zero chance of this goal being achieved .\nFanatical pursuit of net zero , what Epstein all too accurately calls the West \u2019 s \u201c unilateral disempowerment , \u201d will bring the West to its knees .\nThe only way to avoid this outcome is to expose and defeat the animating ideology behind net zero .\nIn this regard , Smil is circumspect .\nHe tiptoes around the ideological component of climate change , an approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential readership of his book .\nBy contrast , Epstein \u2019 s purpose is to defeat the ideology of climate change on the battlefield of ideas .\nFor this reason , the most important chapter of his book\u2014and , indeed , Smil \u2019 s\u2014is the last one , which sets out Epstein \u2019 s blueprint on how to do this .\n\u201c As long as the public remains clueless about the fundamental and unique benefits of fossil fuels , eliminating carbon dioxide emissions will seem like a low-cost or even costless goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s aim is to break the monopoly of the moral case for eliminating fossil fuels , and his most significant finding is that climate change as an ideology has feet of clay .\nThrough countless interactions , Epstein has found that the key to changing minds is by asking people to agree to the principle of considering the full context\u2014and what follows is relatively easy .\n\u201c The whole anti-impact framework consists of largely implicit , unscrutinized beliefs that persist for most people only because their true nature and positive alternatives have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will contribute to breaking the moral monopoly against fossil fuels is reality , \u201d Epstein says .\nBecause both books describe the reality of modern civilization \u2019 s dependence on fossil fuels , in the current climate , they are both dangerous books and subversive to the prevailing anti\u2013fossil fuel ideology .\nOne difference between the two is that How the World Really Works was reviewed in the Washington Post , whereas Epstein was the target of a botched hit job in the same paper .\nBoth authors are to be commended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their books matter .\nEveryone should be encouraged to read one of these indispensable books .\nOr read both .\n__________ Rupert Darwall is a senior fellow at RealClearFoundation , researching issues from international climate agreements to the integration of environmental , social , and

RealClearPolitics.com and RealClearWire.com Earlier this month , President Biden outlined an ambitious plan to reduce cancer deaths , reigniting his famous \u201c Cancer Moonshot \u201d idea , which he first proposed in 2016 and reignited in February of this year .\nThis second \u201c reignition \u201d aims to cut cancer deaths in half over the next 25 years .\nThat \u2019 s an admirable goal , but it \u2019 s also impossible to achieve , thanks to government price controls that the president himself recently signed into law .\nUntil repealed , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Biden \u2019 s cancer moonshot never gets off the ground .\nExperts across the spectrum agree the price controls in the newly signed Inflation Reduction Act will stifle the development of new , life-saving drugs , and especially cancer drugs .\nIt \u2019 s not a question of whether there will be fewer cures , but how many fewer .\nThe IRA includes a pair of new government mandates aimed at forcing down prescription drug costs : a drug price-dictation scheme misleadingly labeled a process for Medicare to \u201c negotiate \u201d drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on future pharmaceutical price increases to match inflation .\nThe \u201c negotiation \u201d mandate requires Medicare to set a \u201c maximum fair price \u201d for high-cost , high-use drugs deemed to have insufficient generic competition and then to \u201c negotiate \u201d deep discounts down from these maximums .\nFailure to \u201c negotiate \u201d will subject a manufacturer to a draconian 95 % tax on gross receipts from its sales of the drug \u2013 a death sentence for the product .\nThe Godfather would be proud .\nA major , perverse effect of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices of new drugs to go up , because drugmakers will have little choice but to try to recover their enormous investment costs up front .\nOn average , it takes ten years and $ 3 billion to develop a new drug in this country .\nA second perverse result will be higher drug costs for the 155 million Americans who obtain their health insurance through the workplace .\nThis will happen because the IRA \u2019 s mandates apply to Medicare but not to workplace health plans .\nInevitably , manufacturers will shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition will lead not only to higher prices , but also to less funding for research and development .\nResearchers at the University of Chicago estimate biomedical R & D will fall by nearly 20 % through 2039 .\nThat \u2019 s an estimated $ 663 billion over the next generation that will not be invested in developing new , life-saving therapies , and an estimated 135 new medicines that will never come to market .\nWhich brings us to the cancer moonshot .\nThe negative effects of government price controls will disproportionately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cancer-specific research will fall by an estimated $ 18 billion a year .\nThat \u2019 s more than nine times as much money as would be added by the moonshot initiative !\nWhile Congressional Democrats have contended that greater funding for the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration will make up for the reductions in pharmaceutical innovation , throwing more money at these big bureaucracies won \u2019 t generate miracles .\nNIH is designed to fund basic research , not product development .\nAnd the FDA is notoriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sometimes forbids the sale of new drugs in the U.S. that have been on the market in Europe and Japan for years .\nWhen President Biden reignited his cancer initiative back in February , he claimed that \u201c because of recent progress in cancer therapeutics \u2026 it \u2019 s now possible to set ambitious goals.\n\u201d But six months later , he signed a bill making those goals impossible to achieve .\nIt \u2019 s not too late to end this self-sabotage .\nWe can give cancer patients hope by replacing today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R & D and market-driven innovation .\nWe can supercharge that innovation by removing senseless government barriers to competition and empowering patients with more personal options .\nWe can shoot for the moon without shooting ourselves in the foot .\n__________

"content": "Commentary by Rupert Darwall originally published by RealClearEnergy.org and RealClearWire.com The West is experiencing its third energy crisis .\nThe first , in 1973 , was caused by the near-quintupling of the price of crude oil by Gulf oil producers in response to America \u2019 s support for Israel in the Yom Kippur war .\nTheir action brought an end to what the French call the trente glorieuses\u2014the unprecedented post\u2013World War II economic expansion .\nThe second occurred at the end of the 1970s , when Iran \u2019 s Islamic revolution led to a more than doubling of oil prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the policy response was far better .\nInflation was purged at the cost of deep recession .\nEnergy markets were permitted to function .\nHigh oil prices induced substitution effects , particularly in the power sector , and stimulated increased supply .\nIn the space of nine months , the oil price cratered from $ 30 a barrel in November 1985 to $ 10 a barrel in July 1986 .\nIt \u2019 s no wonder that the economic expansion that started under Ronald Reagan had such long legs .\nThis time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not sparked by Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies or by Iranian ayatollahs .\nIt was self-inflicted , a foreseeable outcome of policy choices made by the West : Germany \u2019 s disastrous Energiewende that empowered Vladimir Putin to launch an energy war against Europe ; Britain \u2019 s self-regarding and self-destructive policy of \u201c powering past coal \u201d and its decision to ban fracking ; and , as Joseph Toomey shows in his powerful essay , President Biden \u2019 s war on the American oil and gas industry .\nHostilities were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Democratic presidential nomination .\n\u201c I guarantee you .\nWe \u2019 re going to end fossil fuel , \u201d candidate Biden told a climate activist in September 2019 , words that the White House surely hopes get lost down a memory hole .\nToomey \u2019 s paper has all the receipts , so there \u2019 s no danger of that .\nAs he observes , Biden \u2019 s position in 2022 resembles Barack Obama \u2019 s in 2012 , when rising gas prices threatened to sink his reelection .\nObama responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mate lacks .\nHe simply stopped talking about climate and switched to an all-of-the-above energy policy , shamelessly claiming credit for the fracking revolution that his own EPA tried to strangle at birth .\nPassage of the comically mistitled Inflation Reduction Act places this option beyond Biden \u2019 s reach , even if he were so inclined .\nDemocrats are hardly going to take a vow of climate omert\u00e0 when they \u2019 ve achieved a political triumph of pushing through Congress what they regard as the most significant climate legislation to date .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from recent highs , the factors behind high gasoline prices remain in place .\nForemost among these is the steep decline in U.S. oil refinery capacity triggered when Covid lockdowns crushed demand but continued after the economy reopened .\nThere has never been such a large fall in operable refinery capacity .\nMoreover , Gulf Coast refineries were operating at 97 percent of their operating capacity in June 2022 .\nAs Toomey remarks , \u201c There isn \u2019 t any more blood to be squeezed out of this turnip.\n\u201d Toomey identifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity .\nEPA biofuel blending mandates impose crippling costs on smaller refineries .\nWhen conventional refineries are converted to processing biofuels , up to 90 percent of their capacity is lost .\nBiofuel mandates cost consumers far more than federal excise taxes .\nToomey demonstrates that the Biden administration \u2019 s claim that biofuel mandates protect consumers from oil-price volatility is totally false ; biofuel prices , he writes , \u201c are essentially indexed to the price of crude oil.\n\u201d Biden could order the reversal of the EPA \u2019 s retroactive biofuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done so demonstrates that the administration isn \u2019 t serious about making energy affordable again .\nHigh prices for fossil fuel energy are an intended part of the plan .\nCorporate and Wall Street ESG policies are another factor driving refinery closures , especially of facilities owned by European oil companies to meet punishing decarbonization targets that will effectively end up sunsetting them as oil companies .\nIf finalized as proposed , the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2019 s proposed climate disclosure rules , with the strong support of the Biden administration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gas companies to climate activists and woke investors to force them to progressively divest their carbon-intensive activities , such as refining crude oil , and eventually out of the oil and gas sector altogether .\nTo these should be added aggressive federal policies aimed at phasing out gasoline-powered vehicles in favor of electric vehicles ( EVs ) ; an administration staffed from top to bottom by militants who believe that climate is the only thing that matters in politics ; and an increasingly hostile political climate ( \u201c you know the deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when campaigning for the presidency .\n\u201c When they don \u2019 t deliver , put them in jail \u201d ) .\nThese policies , argues Toomey , will see China become the world \u2019 s leading oil refiner for years to come .\nWill Biden find himself asking China for supplies of refined gasoline ?\nHe might well find himself being saved from such an unfortunate position , made more so by Speaker Pelosi \u2019 s recent trip to Taiwan , by help from the other side of the southern border .\nMexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , due to start producing gasoline next year .\nPerhaps President Biden \u2019 s next foreign trip should be

upset with him .\nIn a 60 Minutes interview aired September 18 , Biden lectured Americans that the economic news doesn \u2019 t look so bad when put in the proper \u201c perspective.\n\u201d Year-over-year inflation is at a 40-year high , he admitted , but it isn \u2019 t getting much worse at this time !\nRecent polling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the President to convince the hardworking blue-collar Americans whom private-sector union bosses regard as their core constituency that the 2022 economy is really fine .\nThat \u2019 s a key reason why , unless things change dramatically before Election Day , support for Biden \u2019 s Democrat Party among working-class voters of all races and ethnicities will be substantially lower in 2022 than it was in 2020 .\nBut top Big Labor officials like AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler have amassed a huge political war chest to browbeat millions of forced union dues-paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allies in key U.S. House and Senate contests , despite workers \u2019 well-founded perception that they are worse off now than they were under GOP President Donald Trump .\nAccording to a recent analysis by veteran union strategist and numbers maven Chris Bohner , in 2019 and 2020 alone union officials admitted to spending more than $ 1.4 billion on \u201c politics and lobbying \u201d in the LM-2 disclosure forms they filed with the U.S. Labor Department .\nAnd even that huge sum doesn \u2019 t account for a wide array of union-boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blue-collar Americans to Big Labor \u2019 s favorite chief executive in decades to \u201c misinformation and disinformation , \u201d Shuler is vowing that her giant union conglomerate will \u201c mobilize like never before \u201d to elect pro-forced unionism candidates this November .\nThat means the union machine can reasonably be expected to pour even more money into politics and lobbying in the current campaign cycle than it did in 2019-20 .\nBohner \u2019 s data show there are now more than 10,000 people on union payrolls earning a gross salary of over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not most of these union professionals are available to do full-time political work this fall .\nButtressed by an army of up to 100,000 \u201c volunteer \u201d activists who are in reality typically paid modest wages from union treasuries to serve as political door-knockers in battleground districts and states , they are a formidable political force .\nThis nationwide electioneering outfit meant to keep partisan allies of President Biden in charge of both chambers of Congress will be financed largely by forced dues and fees extracted from unionized workers who oppose Biden and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be voted out .\nThis is a gross abuse of workers \u2019 political freedom , which likely can only be stopped through passage of a National Right to Work law prohibiting all forced union dues and fees as a condition of employment .\n__________ Stan Greer is the National Right to Work

Mooney originally published by RealClearEnergy.org and RealClearWire.com In the approaching 2022 midterm elections , American voters will have the opportunity to decide whether oil industry executives are really to blame for high energy prices\u2014or if it \u2019 s instead the political class that needs a shakeup .\nIn a new report for Real Clear Energy , Joseph Toomey , a career-management consultant , makes a persuasive case that the energy inflation now victimizing American consumers and taxpayers is the result of deliberate public-policy choices made here at home .\nEven as President Biden vilifies energy companies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regime in Washington is beholden to climate extremism at the expense of affordable energy , Toomey argues .\nAs Toomey explains , Biden is poised to create a new industry of climate activists who will use the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) as a conduit for constraining private enterprise with the ostensible purpose of achieving \u201c net zero \u201d carbon emissions .\nMeantime , the president \u2019 s EPA regulators are doubling down on biofuel blending mandates , collectively known as the Renewable Fuel Standard , a byproduct of the Energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new rules impose retroactive compliance requirements over a two-year period .\nThey \u2019 re just the latest of the Biden \u2019 s administration \u2019 s anti-energy initiatives .\nRecall that the president canceled the Keystone XL Pipeline on his first day in office and imposed a moratorium on oil and gas drilling on federal lands just a few days later .\nAnd Toomey documents a host of other choices that have put U.S. policy in the hands of \u201c anti-energy zealots.\n\u201d Or consider two key Biden appointees : John Kerry , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gina McCarthy , top climate advisor , who served as EPA administrator under Barack Obama .\nKerry has been a longtime proponent of the Paris Climate Accord , a U.N. agreement designed to put America last and China first .\nMcCarthy , who recently left the White House , is a former president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council , a green group with close ties to China .\nSearch for White House statements critical of China \u2019 s environmental record and you won \u2019 t find much .\nBiden did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , China \u2019 s president , declined to participate in the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow last year .\nBut it hardly compares to the \u201c harshly worded letter \u201d addressed to American energy companies , as Toomey explains , in which Biden needled companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron for their \u201c historically high profit margins for refining oil into gasoline.\n\u201d Biden \u2019 s claims about oil-industry profiteering ring hollow .\nWhen he said , for instance , that \u201c Exxon made more money than God , \u201d the president neglected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 22 billion in 2020 , according to Toomey \u2019 s report .\nA major challenge besetting American industry is the accelerated pace of refinery closures .\nSeveral factors have played a role\u2014but especially Environmental , Social and Governance ( ESG ) polices , which , as Toomey points out , have found a home in corporate boardrooms and in the Biden White House .\nOver the next few months , and into 2024 , we will see \u201c significant refinery closures , \u201d Toomey warns , in response to corporate America \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies will see China become the world \u2019 s leading refiner for years to come , \u201d Toomey warns , \u201c and that fact doesn \u2019 t seem to bother anyone in Washington.\n\u201d But it should bother American voters .\nThe coup de grace for the American oil and gas industry under Biden \u2019 s watch may come in the form of a proposed ESG rule that would empower the SEC to coerce companies into disclosing their so-called climate related risks .\n\u201c The SEC disclosure rules would give rise to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lobbyists , and consultants who will busy themselves with the economically dubious work of counting the emissions intensity of industrial activity , \u201d Toomey maintains .\n\u201c Interestingly , the SEC had already adopted rules in 2010 obligating registrants to disclose material climate-related risks on their public income and balance-sheet statements.\n\u201d Essentially , companies would be compelled to weigh the emissions footprints not just of their vendors , but also of various intermediaries , including contractors and customers .\nIn effect , the SEC rule would make it virtually impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not yet been approved\u2014another reason why the November elections matter .\nDespite economic turmoil and high energy prices , Toomey does not expect the Biden administration to reverse course .\nEnvironmental activists now calling the shots in the White House want to drive the oil and gas industry out of business\u2014all in the name of climate change , he explains , and without regard for the effect on energy consumers .\nToomey also suggests that Biden is taking direction from climate activists who loathe constitutional government .\n\u201c To assure the success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urge Biden to act outside the law and declare a \u2018 climate emergency , \u2019 \u201d he writes .\n\u201c This would enable the president to bypass the niceties of regular constitutional order and shut down all oil and gas production.\n\u201d Kevin Mooney is an investigative reporter with both the Commonwealth Foundation and the Heritage Foundation .", "author": "Deneen

by RealClearPolitics.com and RealClearWire.com As the leader of a nonprofit group whose mission is to promote economic freedom , sound public policy , and responsible financial management at the state level , I \u2019 m honored to help our nation \u2019 s financial officers practice good stewardship of taxpayer dollars .\nTheir work often includes managing pension funds that are vital to millions of Americans \u2019 retirement security .\nOver the past few years , a growing threat called ESG ( Environmental , Social , Governance ) has been negatively impacting state pension systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sadly , our nation \u2019 s state financial officers and the retirees they have a fiduciary responsibility to protect are increasingly under siege by ESG ideologues who are motivated by politics rather than economics .\nFor instance , U.S. Rep. Sean Casten , a Democrat from a competitive district in Illinois who has come under fire for allegedly lining his own pockets with taxpayer-funded energy dollars , devoted more than half of his time in a recent congressional hearing to defaming our organization .\nCasten accused the State Financial Officers \u2019 Foundation ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 a claim he made without evidence \u2013 while ignoring his own conflicts of interest and the catastrophic failures of his own energy strategy .\nCasten is trying to strongarm bank CEOs into blacklisting us .\nHe asserts that we are trying to \u201c [ block ] the capital sector from freely allocating capital.\n\u201d But our goal is precisely the opposite .\nWe trust free people and free markets to allocate scarce resources more effectively than politicians in Washington .\nHistory and economics are on our side .\nWhat Casten and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic freedom is by far the best policy for the planet and its people .\nAs Nick Loris , vice president of Public Policy at C3 Solutions argues , free economies are twice as clean as less free economies .\nWhat Casten and others are attempting to do is to centralize the economy by using ESG principles as their manifesto .\nBy embracing ESG cancel culture , Casten is blocking the development of affordable energy .\nThe one thing Casten gets mostly right is when he says SFOF is advancing \u201c policies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invest in areas that are struggling to attract capital.\n\u201d Those areas have names \u2013 West Virginia , Texas , Utah , etc .\n\u2013 and the reason they are struggling to attract capital isn \u2019 t because the businesses aren \u2019 t financially sound .\nIndeed , 2022 has been a banner year for conventional energy sources that abound in these states .\nThe reason they are challenged is because investment firms and financial institutions in recent years have implemented de facto boycotts of American energy producers .\nFirms like BlackRock have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaviors , \u201d sometimes by penetrating corporate boards , sometimes by starving unfavored businesses of capital , all in obeisance to an agenda based on subjective and ephemeral criteria , divorced from historical markers of a company \u2019 s financial strength .\nIt \u2019 s not surprising that many state financial officers are fighting back against ESG ideologues who are attempting to end investment in industries they find objectionable , American energy producers in particular , regardless of the impact it has on communities and states across the country .\nAnd SFOF has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in clean energy companies .\nUnlike Casten , we trust free markets and free people and deplore command-and-control policymaking .\nCasten apparently believes that castigating state financial officers will be politically beneficial .\nWe support his First Amendment right to be wrong .\nPolls show that Casten is on the wrong side of not just the American people but also Democrats when it comes to demonizing American sources of energy .\nA strong majority of Democrats ( 71 % ) support an \u201c all of the above \u201d energy strategy that rejects the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ESG mantra .\nIn the meantime , SFOF and its members will continue to stand up to what we see as a destructive ESG movement , which advances a progressive agenda outside the democratic process .\nWe \u2019 ve made a consistent argument to financial institutions that are driving ESG while being cheered on by radical , left-wing politicians .\nIt is simply this : return to fulfilling your fiduciary duty and focus on returns , instead of making investment decisions based on subjective criteria unrelated to business profitability .\nBy embracing economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and embracing the innovation of the free market , we can create prosperity for our communities , protect the planet , and build a future of which we can all be proud .\n__________ Derek Kreifels is the

\u2019 s energy supply is a result of the state \u2019 s dependence on renewable energy .\nAn ABC News story pointed to the challenges of solar power : \u201c The solar supply decreases toward the end of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use after 3 p.m. or 4 p.m .\nThere can also be uncertainty with solar supply due to factors such as cloud cover and smoke from wildfires , as the state battles several blazes.\n\u201d Summer is not the only challenge for states that are reducing their use of coal and nuclear energy even though the latter doesn \u2019 t emit carbon dioxide .\nA recent Wall Street Journal story warned New England states might face blackouts if there is a cold snap of weather during this winter .\nThe electricity challenges are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a power source for the power grid and also reducing nuclear power .\nAs a result , New England is extremely dependent on natural gas but the region doesn \u2019 t have the pipeline infrastructure to deliver enough of the fuel when in high demand .\nThe region was supplementing the supply of natural gas by using liquified natural gas ( LNG ) from ships but this year it will be harder to get supply because of increased worldwide demand due to Russia \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine .\nThe region also has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this power source , but wind and solar power only provide about 12 percent of the electricity for its power grid .\nThe possible blackouts will occur when natural gas is used to heat homes , leaving power operators short of supply .\nElectricity shortages in the winter are not the only challenge in New England .\nBloomberg reported a shortage of home heating oil in New York and New England .\nThe shortage is tied to low diesel supplies which is the same liquid fuel as home heating oil .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governors panicked and they met with U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm over rising fossil fuel prices and shortages .\nInstead of whining to Granholm , the governors should have recognized the limitations of renewable energy and advocated for a diverse source of power plant fuel and sought the construction of refineries and natural gas pipelines in the region .\nThanks to Democrats \u2019

Is a Horrific Idea", "content": "Commentary by Earl Matthews originally published by RealClearEnergy and RealClearWire The steep rise in U.S. gasoline prices over the past year has placed a huge burden on working families , and government leaders are scrambling for potential solutions .\nUnfortunately , one proposed idea \u2013 the reinstatement of the crude oil export ban \u2013 would carry massively negative economic , national security , and geopolitical implications .\nThe Biden administration officials and members of Congress who have floated this deeply flawed idea of limiting exports apparently believe that if all of the oil that the United States produces stays within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available to us and lower prices .\nBut these export ban supporters fail to understand the basics of how oil markets work .\nAs the Dallas Federal Reserve explains , the price of oil is determined by the global marketplace and for that reason , \u201c a cessation of U.S. crude oil exports would lower the supply of oil in global markets and raise its price.\n\u201d In fact , between 2014 , the year before the crude oil export ban was lifted , and 2019 , U.S. crude oil exports rose by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasoline fell by 22 percent .\nNot only would such a ban backfire and cause gasoline prices to increase for American drivers , but it would also alienate our global allies and undermine U.S. national security .\nDuring this global energy crisis , our trading partners have been able to count on the United States as a reliable supplier of crude oil who won \u2019 t weaponize energy resources and this has strengthened our relationships with allies around the world .\nAs the past year has shown , crude oil is essential for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s refined into gasoline that powers our cars , is used as a feedstock for industrial operations , and its byproducts form the building blocks for all sorts of everyday items like computers , medicine , and clothes .\nAnd make no doubt about it , if the United States shuts off crude oil exports to our friends in Europe , Asia , and Latin America , then they will immediately begin searching for replacement supplies from countries like Iran and Venezuela who do not share our democratic , human rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have shown they are happy to step into the void that the United States will have unnecessarily created .\nThanks to the shale revolution and the innovation of U.S. oil companies , domestic production of crude oil has increased from 5 million barrels per day in 2005 to more than 11 million barrels per day in 2021 .\nWe shouldn \u2019 t manufacture a false choice between domestic use and exports .\nThe United States is producing enough crude oil to do both .\nPreviously , U.S. foreign policy was restricted by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle East , but the shale revolution completely changed that dynamic and history has shown that the past two decades have been a defining moment that has cemented America \u2019 s central position as an energy superpower and dependable trading power .\nNow this is the key question : do we want economic and military powers like the European Union , India , and South Korea to maintain a strong crude oil trading relationship with the United States ?\nOr do we want them sending money to dictatorships who use their wealth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global security ?\nThis is not a theoretical debate .\nIn 2019 , the U.S. State Department blacklisted an Iranian-directed \u201c oil for terror \u201d network that supplied Syria with oil and used the money from the sales to financially support terrorist organizations like the Quds Force and Hezbollah .\nIf we limit our exports , we are forcing our allies in Europe to look to some of those same hostile regimes to get their oil .\nSince the turn of the century , the United States has become a global energy superpower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our imports decreased .\nWe must now decide if we want to leverage this advantage to strengthen our global relationships and tilt geopolitics towards a more a free , secure , and prosperous future ?\nOr do we limit crude oil exports , raise gasoline prices for American families already reeling under record inflation , and push our allies closer to our enemies ?\nThe answer should be obvious and maintaining a steady supply of U.S. crude oil exports is one of the most effective ways of bolstering our national security and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a former Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs & Senior Director for Defense Policy on the National

Daniel Turner originally published by RealClearEnergy and made available via RealClearWire Years ago , one of my high school teachers showed us the great essay by Leonard Read called \u201c I , Pencil.\n\u201d We used pencils in those pre-Internet days , and my \u201c young mind full of mush \u201d ( hat tip to Rush Limbaugh ) was inspired by the essay \u2019 s message : the common pencil , in its components , is extraordinarily complex and the result of the free cooperation of unquantifiable interested parties .\nNo one person makes a pencil .\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of people , and yet it is sold for pennies .\nThe government did not commission the pencil .\nNo legislation of Congress authorized it .\nThe pencil is a marvel of free market capitalism .\nMy three decades of reflection on this essay came to mind while reading Joseph Toomey \u2019 s exhaustive and brilliant analysis of the Biden administration \u2019 s energy agenda .\n\u201c Energy Inflation Was by Design \u201d lays out clearly the state of America \u2019 s most critical industry before and after Biden \u2019 s inauguration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political rhetoric of \u201c going green \u201d or \u201c getting rid of fossil fuels.\n\u201d In the spirit of \u201c I , Pencil , \u201d I similarly marvel at the fossil fuel industry .\nGas is as ordinary as a pencil .\nWe fill up our tanks every day , or jump in a rideshare , hop on a plane , jet ski around a lake , without taking any notice of the miracle of this fuel .\nGas is the result of the labor of innumerable individual contributions , from geologists to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ends at the local filling station , yet it is cheaper than bottled water .\nPencils and gas are both marvels of free market capitalism , as are countless petrochemical products , from plastics and rubber to laundry detergent and cosmetics .\nThe only non-market force capable of disrupting this well-oiled machine is government .\nThat \u2019 s exactly what Joe Biden did .\nToomey outlines the numerous times Biden promised to \u201c get rid of \u201d the fossil fuel industry .\nBiden announced executive orders on his first day in office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gas leases on federal land .\nAs the title of Toomey \u2019 s report suggests : energy inflation was by design .\nFor two years , I \u2019 ve discussed this issue on television and radio programs and asked the same question : How did the Biden administration not know what the consequences would be of such policies ?\nToomey answers the question : they did know .\nThey desired these results .\nAmericans may have some mistrust of the fossil fuel industry , but they love its products .\nThey love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn a recent survey , 63 % of young people with an income of less than $ 10,000 use third-party food delivery services rather than buying their own ingredients or preparing their own food .\nIt wasn \u2019 t long ago that only \u201c the rich \u201d could have food brought to them .\nNow kids with an allowance and baby-sitting money are using Postmates for Chipotle .\nOnly fossil fuels make such luxury possible .\nThe political formula for team Biden was simple : to make fossil fuels unpopular , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them expensive , they had to make them hard to bring to market .\nOnly government has such power .\nWhen declining markets or war or natural disaster caused turmoil in the past , the industry responded accordingly .\nOnly government has the power to shut it down .\nShut it down they have done .\nWe are living with the consequences of the Biden administration \u2019 s actions : everything is more expensive from the obvious gas and heating oil and utility bills to food , consumer goods , and everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhen Americans suffer enough , when the pain threshold is reached , they will cry out for relief \u2013 and then the green transition can truly begin .\nYou can almost hear people saying : How bad can wind and solar be ?\nIt can \u2019 t be worse than this !\nAs Pete Buttigieg , Biden \u2019 s Transportation secretary , said at a Senate hearing , \u201c the more pain from the high price of gas , \u201d the more it benefits the switch to the Democrat-preferred electric vehicle .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for Mayor Pete ?\nNot enough yet .\nContrast that to the ethos of \u201c I , Pencil , \u201d of people cooperating freely to create a product at a lower price for everyone .\nFree market capitalism does not speak of \u201c pain \u201d as a viable market force .\nOnly politicians do .\nToomey \u2019 s analysis is a remarkable glimpse into how we got here as well as a roadmap for what not to do to our energy industry .\nWith two years left of the Biden administration \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on American

the price of everything else \u2013 including renewable power systems themselves .\nAs I show in a graphic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterization of a \u201c Putin price spike \u201d is demonstrably false .\nOil prices spiked 75 % from the time President Biden took office in January 2021 to Russia \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine at the end of February 2022 .\nPresident Biden himself stated the desired pathway to much higher oil prices : \u201c No more drilling on federal lands .\nNo more drilling including offshore .\nNo ability for the oil industry to continue to drill , period .\n[ It ] ends .\nNo more , no new fracking.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 90 % of our domestic oil and gas production .\nAs Toomey puts it : \u201c There was nothing about ramping up oil production as a patriotic duty , nothing about getting more refining capacity on line \u2018 or else.\n\u2019 Biden \u2019 s rock-solid promise was that the oil industry\u2014in fact , all segments of the fossil fuel industry , including natural gas and coal , would go extinct in short order.\n\u201d Why would any industry invest capital in a business that President Biden has vowed to put out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oil and gas companies for today \u2019 s high prices while not building new refining capacity ( made nearly impossible by environmental laws ) underscores the administration \u2019 s ignorance of how markets work .\nIn fact , progressives celebrated when many refineries went out of business during Covid under sunken demand , because \u201c it was good for climate change.\n\u201d Indeed , all of this backwardness is best exemplified by California Democrat Ro Khanna .\nIn an embarrassing flip flop , Khanna has now been demonizing the oil industry for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , he was demanding it produce less to \u201c fight climate change.\n\u201d Cue The Twilight Zone theme : the oil industry is now under attack for not producing enough oil by those insisting that we get away from oil and have a net-zero future .\nToomey \u2019 s report also hits another progressive energy policy disaster : the ESG obsession that is dangerously starving the oil and gas industry of capital .\nCombined with supply bottlenecks , rising interest rates , and workforce shortages , ESG is making new production almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase \u201d in the price of oil and gas .\nI have exposed the gigantic holes in the ESG movement when it comes to oil investment , particularly on purported moral grounds .\nESG is making the manufacturing of all U.S. products , not just oil and gas , far more costly and less economically competitive than foreign production , thus benefitting some of the world \u2019 s most repressive regimes .\nWhat can only be described as a hatred of the oil and gas industry is also pushing young people away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how college students are no longer majoring in petroleum engineering , for instance , though it is the highest-paying major .\nThis is ominous because the Department of Energy models that American oil demand will actually slightly increase in the decades ahead , while natural gas demand will jump 13 % , to over 34 trillion cubic feet .\nThe industry will need more workers than ever .\nBut the overwhelming numbers in favor of oil and gas make these conclusions completely obvious .\nFor example , we have over 270 million oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on electricity ( a sector dominated by natural gas , by the way ) .\nToomey \u2019 s report makes clear just how dependent any sort of an \u201c EV revolution \u201d would make us on global mineral and metal supply chains controlled by China .\nUltimately , the renewables and electric cars push has a physics problem , not a lack of investment problem .\nThe entire plan to phase out fossil fuels stands on shaky ground because the proclaimed \u201c alternatives , \u201d like wind and solar , are naturally intermittent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viable , after hundreds of billions of dollars spent and decades of forced mandates , green-obsessed Germany and California would have the most \u201c alternative \u201d energy systems in the world .\nThey have anything but that .\nGermany has been forced to build more oil and gas pipelines and is rushing a liquefied natural gas import build-out ; and for years , Germany has had the world \u2019 s highest electricity prices .\nCalifornia is not far behind ( 50-60 % above the U.S. average ) .\nOil and gas supply a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California \u2019 s energy \u2013 more than the national average .\nCost comparisons between renewables and fossil fuels are simply not relevant because the two do not offer the same service : \u201c usually not available \u201d can not be price-compared to \u201c almost always available.\n\u201d For example , the Department of Energy reports that \u201c dispatchable \u201d coal- and gas-based power generation are available over 85 % of the time , while even on good days , \u201c non-dispatchable \u201d wind and solar are available just 30 % of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas ( another cost that goes ignored ) .\nIn July , Bloomberg reported that wind was generating a paltry 8 % of available capacity in sweltering Texas .\nCrushed by inflationary pressures , renewables and electric cars are seeing their costs soar amid rising demand for the massive amount of minerals and metals required to construct them .\nAs we just saw with Commonwealth Wind , more and more renewable projects are \u201c no longer viable.\n\u201d This is an immense problem , especially so early into the game , so expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar , and EVs to eventually be forced to be pulled back ( e.g.\n, California extending the life of Diablo Canyon nuclear ) .\nBelieve what you see , and what is actually happening in the marketplace , not what you hear .\nGermany and California show that \u201c alternative \u201d energy is really just \u201c supplemental \u201d energy .\n__________ This article was originally

originally published by RealClearEducation and RealClearWire.com The dominant response to the recently-released NAEP Report Card on 4th and 8th grade proficiency scores has been to focus on the adverse effects of school closures : declining competencies , particularly for the lowest performing students .\nWhat is buried in the report is the continued alarmingly low black student scores on both reading and math sections and their inability to close the racial gap as they move from the 4th to 8th grade .\nWhereas nationally , 86 % of white 4th graders were at least on grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for only 55 % of black students .\nThe national black score was pulled down by the dismal performance of black students in the poorest performing cities : Baltimore , Cleveland , Detroit , Milwaukee , and Philadelphia .\nIn these five cities , the average share of black students performing at least at grade level was 28 % , with none having more than 31 % .\nThese cities highlight the large math deficits experienced in many poor black neighborhoods nationally .\nAs students progressed to the 8th grade , the share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 15 % ( 86 to 74 % ) for white students nationally .\nAmong black students the decline was 30 % , both nationally ( from 55 to 38 % ) and among black students in the five cities ( 28 to 20 % ) .\nThis strongly suggests that math racial disparities are growing even for black students who are living outside large cities .\nRoughly 54 % of black residents within the 100 largest American metro areas were suburbanites in 2020 .\nThe growing racial math performance gap for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Brookings Report found that in 2019 , only 7 % of black test-takers score at least 600 on the math portion of the SAT exam .\nBy contrast , 11 % , 31 % , and 62 % of Latino , white , and Asian test-takers , respectively , did that well .\nThese low scores indicate that a large portion black students are leaving high school without the tools to be successful in college STEM majors .\nThe recent NAEP results did include a bit of encouraging news .\nIn contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both black and white students who meet basic minimum standards in the reading section increased for all groups but more for black than white students nationally , modestly narrowing the racial gap for reading scores .\nLarger increases for black students in the weakest performing cities also closed the gaps among blacks .\nDespite these modest relative improvements , however , racial gaps and gaps across black communities remained large .\nIf we look at the particular poor performance of black 4th graders in the low-performing cities , one possible response is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHowever , more school funding will probably make little difference since these five cities have some of the highest per pupil expenditures among the 100 largest US school districts .\nAlternatively , many believe that reducing economic hardships with robust income supplements can help reduce the racial educational performance gaps .\nIn the last forty years , the number of neighborhoods with concentrated poverty has doubled .\nHowever , it is unlikely that providing these families with a modest income increase through either enhanced child credits or a universal income allowance would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap .\nAs the urbanist Robert Sampson has argued , intergenerational poverty leads to behavioral adaptations that often stand in the way of moving forward .\nOne adaptation has been childbearing decisions , leading to 70 % of black children being born to unmarried women .\nIndeed , 29 % of black children are born to unmarried women under 25 years old compared to 12 % of white children .\nYoung motherhood often leads to the father-goes-round family dynamics that the liberal sociologist Kathryn Edin documented .\nPoor black women sequentially have children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially for boys .\nA second adaption has been gun violence .\nMore than thirty years ago , Ta-Nehisi Coates described the persistent gun violence in his Baltimore neighborhood that led his parents to move to the suburbs .\nMichael Berg detailed how black teenage boys in Pittsburgh had to adopt aggressive behaviors for fear that if they were seen as \u201c soft , \u201d they would be taken advantage of .\nRecently , some progressive advocates have justified ending criminal charges for New York City youth who possess illegal weapons because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawless areas in which they live .\nThe liberal sociologist Patrick Sharkey found that the neighborhood gun violence many poor black children endure , creates psychological trauma that substantially hinder their educational progress .\nProgressives have no effective ideas to reduce the troubling racial skill disparities that plague our country .\nFor example , rather than providing strategies to increase black test performance , the Brookings report recommended reducing substantially the role of SAT scores because the test discourages black ( and Latino ) students from pursuing STEM majors .\nDespite evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities , many activists continue to be unwilling to back strategies to reduce the gun culture or the family chaos that creates psychological distress among too many black youths .\nOnly by finding initiatives to limit these stresses can we hope to turn

environmental , social , and governance ( ESG ) investing phenomenon is undercutting the core purpose of financial institutions , jeopardizing the economic security of investors , politicizing our capital markets and private enterprises , and threatening the stability of our energy supply .\nSimply put , financial firms and institutional investors should be solely focused on delivering maximum financial returns to investors so they can achieve the American dream .\nESG funds are antithetical to this goal .\nFor starters , ESG funds carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-ESG funds .\nSecond , a recent study found that over the past five years , global ESG funds have underperformed the broader market by 250 basis points per year , an average 6.3 % return compared with an 8.9 % return .\nThis means that an investor who put $ 10,000 into an average global ESG fund in 2017 would have realized a $ 1,750 lower return than if they had invested in the broader market .\nThis stands to reason since ESG funds are less diversified , light on energy stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning that a year like 2022 is catastrophic for investors because tech stocks significantly underperformed , and energy stocks significantly overperformed the market overall .\nMany ESG proponents on Wall Street and in government , such as Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Chair Gary Gensler , argue that ESG is investor driven .\nBut a recent University of Chicago and FINRA study revealed that only 21 % of investors even know what ESG stands for .\nThat \u2019 s why financial advisors and brokers need to focus exclusively on advancing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially true during a time when a historic number of seniors are struggling to retire , and American small businesses and families are being crushed by the highest levels of inflation in four decades .\nEven if you don \u2019 t own an investment account , ESG is hitting your pocketbook .\nAs we head into the winter , household energy prices are set to hit a ten-year high , costing the average American family $ 1,200 , according to a report from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association .\nThe weaponization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s obsession with ESG has redirected capital away from American energy projects .\nAs a result , investment in oil and gas exploration and production in 2021 was 25 % lower than 2019 levels .\nIn less than two years , we have moved from a position of energy dominance to energy depletion precisely because of the radical climate finance agenda .\nThat is why we are leading the charge against ESG in defense of investors and to restore American energy dominance .\nIn Kentucky , I ( Treasurer Ball ) obtained an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirming that using state pension plans to invest in ESG is not compatible with Kentucky state law .\nAdditionally , I championed a new state law that enables the Kentucky Treasury to prohibit state entities from contracting with companies that are boycotting oil , gas , and coal .\nThe attorney general opinion and this new law will protect the Commonwealth for years to come should one of my successors decide to go down the rabbit hole of ESG investing .\nAt the federal level , I ( Congressman Barr ) have introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act to supercharge the fiduciary responsibility of investment advisors and Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ) retirement plan sponsors to prioritize financial returns over non-pecuniary factors when making investment decisions on behalf of their clients .\nIn the recently released Commitment to America ( CTA

censor the October 2020 New York Post story about the Hunter Biden laptop is the Democrats worst nightmare and explains their rabid criticism of Musk over his purchase of the company .\nIn totality , the documents and information from an attorney generals lawsuit against the Biden administration shows FBI and Twitter interference in the 2020 presidential election .\nThe FBI gave social media companies a preemptive warning about Russia disinformation about Hunter Biden and the warning fell on fertile political ground inside Twitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political bias political to engineer the censorship of the NewYork Post story .\nJournalist Matt Taibbi was given the assignment by Musk to write about the internal documents about the Hunter laptop .\nTaibbi reported in 2022 , Democrats got 98 % of the donations as compared to only 1.5 % for Republicans .\nThe Democratic mob attack on Musk over his purchase of Twitter is rooted in their fear of transparency and free speech .\nAfter all , the censorship of the New York Post story , according to a poll , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump .\nA free speech social media platform can expose a weaponized FBI , the massive failures of Democratic politicians and their policies can \u2019 t be tolerated so an all out effort is being executed by the political left to bankrupt Twitter .\nThe plan is simple , since Twitter gets 90 % of its revenue from advertisers so if you stop advertising you can stop the platform \u2019 s revenue model and stop Twitter .\nTo meet that end , the Democratic mob was unleashed and launched a massive effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Nov. 1 , Business Insider reported on a letter from 40 left-wing groups to corporations encouraging the them not to advertise on Twitter if content moderation on the platform was halted .\nA few days later , the intimidation campaign escalated when advocacy groups demanded Twitter advertisers \u201d .\n.\n.\nstop buys on the platform in the wake of Elon \u2019 s Musk \u2019 s sweeping layoffs.\n\u201d To organize the effort , a coalition of more than 60 \u201c civil rights and civil society groups \u201d called stoptoxictwitter.com was formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s letters , media and activism tools .\nThe website also has score cards showing 34 Twitter corporate advertisers with a banner \u201c stopped ads on Twitter \u201d crossing off the the company \u2019 s name if the company ceased ad buys .\nThe plan against Twitter follows Democrats \u2019 playbook to target media outlets challenging their near media monopoly .\nIt starts with Democrats and the media branding an individual or media outlet as extreme .\nThis softens up the target allowing left-wing advocacy groups to urge advertisers not to associate its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined attacks are like bombing an island before the invasion \u2014 it weakens the target and sets the tone and political environment for activists to land on the beaches with their ground forces targeting advertisers .\nThe mob attack against Musk and Twitter is following the playbook .\nSoon after its sale to Musk Sen. Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass.\n, slammed Musk in a Tweet .\nShe said the \u201d .\n.\n.\ndeal is dangerous our democracy.\n\u201d CNN , NBC and MSNBC coverage included warnings about the consequences of free speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the possibility of Twitter using its power to favor one political candidate over another .\nMusk noted in a tweet , \u201c Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue , due to activist groups pressuring advertisers , even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists.\n\u201d He added , \u201c Extremely messed up !\nThey \u2019 re trying to destroy free speech in America.\n\u201d In addition to acting as a group , individual members of the stoptoxictwitter.com coalition went after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video released on Twitter titled \u201c # KeepTwitterSafe \u201d that promoted its effort to get advertisers to boycott Twitter because of a rise in hate speech on its platform .\nThe video followed a meeting with Musk where they claimed layoffs at the company undermined a promise he made to Color of Change , Free Press , NAACP and , ADL about fighting keeping civil rights protections .\nGoing after corporate advertisers to harm revenue of media outlets is not new .\nHarassment of advertisers for Bill O \u2019 Reilly \u2019 s show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his leaving the cable network and the same

has changed its procedures for giving out books after news of the incident surfaced last week .\nAs first reported exclusively by The Lion and The Heartlander news sites , a 4-year-old preschooler in the Turner School District in Kansas City , Kansas , took home the book Jacob \u2019 s New Dress .\nIt \u2019 s a picture book in which a little boy wears girls \u2019 clothes and even competes with his friend Emily to be a princess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this should be , obviously , any kind of a subject for a school to be speaking about , \u201d Jim Clay , the 4-year-old \u2019 s grandfather , told The Lion .\n\u201c The sexualization of our children in society today is just disgusting .\nThe grooming that \u2019 s taking place is disgusting.\n\u201d At the end of the week , Clay reported the Turner district had explained what happened and what changes will be made to prevent such a sexually provocative book being tendered to young children there again .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and apparently others , says its early-childhood program began accepting once-weekly donated books last year from local nonprofit LiteracyKC .\nSuch partnerships , the district said , help it expand resources and community outreach .\n\u201c Please be assured that these books were not a part of district curriculum , were not required reading , and were sent home to be read at the discretion of parents , \u201d the district wrote without naming the book in question or explaining how it escaped the district \u2019 s notice .\n\u201c Moving forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all books and activities provided by Literacy KC to ensure they are age-appropriate and align with our district curriculum and educational mission , \u201d the statement concluded \u2013 notably , without apology to offended parents and guardians

advocate who spoke about the cultural divide between parents and schools in Kansas City at a community forum in June .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing in Kansas City preschool classrooms , after having received a multimillion-dollar grant from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education .\nThere is a coordinated effort by trans rights activist groups such as GLSEN ( formerly the Gay , Lesbian & Straight Education Network ) and the Human Rights Campaign to push transgender ideology on schoolchildren nationwide .\n\u201c Literacy KC will need to clean up its act to regain the trust of parents and grandparents in the Kansas City community.\n\u201d Moreover , as Turner has just done , other school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of outsourcing the approval of classroom materials to even well-intentioned outside organizations .\nThe incident also raises questions about Literacy KC \u2019 s vetting process , and how many other school districts in the Kansas City region have handed out books such as Jacob \u2019 s New Dress to the youngest of students \u2013 and whether parents have been made aware of it .\nThe Lion on Monday sent questions to both the Turner district and Literacy KC .\nAmong other things , we asked Literacy KC if this book is being given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if so , which ones ; if Literacy KC continues to consider a cross-dressing book to be appropriate for such young children \u2013 or , if not , whether it will suspend the book \u2019 s distribution ; and whether it is fair for such sexually and gender-identity suggestive books to be given to such young children without pre-approval by parents ?\nThe Lion also has requested copies of any correspondence between the Turner district and Literacy KC about the incident .\nThe Turner district is not the only one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other gender-fluidity books in early grades .\nThe book was noted as objectionable to parents in a news report last month about outrage over transgender policies in Lawrence Township Public Schools in New Jersey .\n\u201c Can we just get back to teaching ?\n\u201d one New Jersey parent was quoted .\nJacob \u2019 s New Dress also was pulled from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools system in North Carolina in 2017 .\nThe media portray such actions as right-wing book banning rather than a matter of discretion , and Jacob \u2019 s New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesson on what to do when someone is bullied.\n\u201d Critics counter that anti-bullying messages can be transmitted outside of a cross-dressing context .\nMoreover , in making the issue one of \u201c book banning , \u201d the media overlook the role and rights of parents in bringing up children .\nThe media don \u2019 t , for instance , call it \u201c banning \u201d when the Motion Picture Association warns parents about age-inappropriate materials in films , with its PG , PG-13 , R , and NC-17 ( adults only ) ratings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s anything goes ?\nNot for Clay , nor many other

.\n\u201c I \u2019 m not interested in pretending that guys are girls and girls are guys .\n\u201c All three of my kids grew up in the Turner district .\nIf there was any questionable material , they

Deep State , he was simply a proxy for the Democratic Party .\nAnd the Democrats , for their part , have become the party of denialism .\nThey have so much control over the sources of information that they no longer even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of impropriety .\nThey just attribute the complaints to the partisan and conspiratorial thinking of their opponents and dismiss them as unworthy of discussion .\nSuch denialism , along with the active support of a complicit media , has shielded Democrats from accountability .\nTony Fauci \u2019 s credibility ?\nHunter Biden laptop ?\nElection fraud ?\n\u201c Nothing to see here .\nMove along.\n\u201d Case in point ?\n\u201c Morning Joe \u201d from last Monday .\nJoe , Mika and the panel all had a good belly laugh over the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Republican Party has \u201c Eyes on the Spies.\n\u201d The sub-headline said \u201c GOP vows House roundup of 51 \u2018 Hunter \u2019 hushers , \u201d and the graphic featured mugshots of Obama administration intelligence apparatchiks John Brennan and James Clapper .\nThey were two of the 51 national security officers who \u2013 two weeks before the 2020 election \u2013 signed their names to a letter that suggested without evidence that the Hunter Biden laptop had \u201c all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\n\u201d This letter provided a smokescreen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shamelessly dissemble , claiming that the laptop \u2019 s evidence of Biden-family influence peddling was somehow manufactured or lacked provenance , which is utterly absurd .\nDidn \u2019 t matter .\nBiden lied because he could get away with it .\nThe friendly media would have his back , and he knew it .\nThe media was integral to the cover-up : The 51 intelligence officers said they based their suspicions in part on \u201c media reports \u2026 that the FBI has now opened an investigation into Russian involvement in this case.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the source for those media reports was one or more of the 51 signatories ?\nTalk about the snake swallowing its own tail !\nAnd now \u201c Morning Joe \u201d is running interference for the Gang of 51 , mocking the idea that these security-clearance grifters should be held accountable for their disruption of the fair election process .\nMSNBC panelist Mike Barnicle mockingly said Americans who are worried about paying for their home heating bill , their food bill , or the \u201c status of their kids in school , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to get to the bottom of the Hunter Biden story .\nWe \u2019 ve got ta get Clapper and Brennan in and find out why they lied.\n\u201d This is gaslighting of the worst sort .\nSince when did liberals assert that Congress can do only one thing at a time ?\nIt also implies that Republicans don \u2019 t care about inflation when the evidence of the past year suggests that it is Biden and the Democrats who don \u2019 t care .\nRepublicans are also the only political party that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in schools \u2013 first from COVID lockdowns and forced vaccinations , and then from drag queens , boys in girls \u2019 sports , and woke history lessons .\nMost importantly , Barnicle implicitly admitted that Brennan and Clapper lied , but acts as though they had every right to do so .\nMika Brzezinski then pulled out the pity card and lamented that the horrible Republicans are \u201c going after Joe Biden \u2019 s remaining son , \u201d as though the sad death of Beau Biden somehow gives Hunter a free pass to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even that is a red herring because the New York Post story isn \u2019 t about going after Hunter Biden ; it \u2019 s about going after the 51 intelligence officials who falsely suggested that evidence of malfeasance in the Biden family was somehow invented by the Russians instead of turned over to a Mac computer repairman by Hunter Biden himself .\nBut hey , we are two years into the Biden administration , and more than three years since the FBI got ahold of the incriminating laptop , and still nothing has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fear when their president is exposed as a liar and a corrupt politician .\nSo maybe \u201c Morning Joe \u201d and the rest of the Democrat defenders are right .\nAccountability is for chumps !\nRemember , it \u2019 s all the fault of those dirty Republicans , and when all else fails : Deny !\nDeny !\nDeny !\n__________ This
