and federal prosecutors \u201c You come at the king , you best not miss.\n\u201d It has been 20 months since an enraged and armed mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol , seeking to stop the peaceful transfer of power .\nSome in the crowd called for then-Vice President Mike Pence \u2014 the constitutionally designated presiding officer at the joint session of Congress convened to certify Joe Biden \u2019 s election victory \u2014 to be hanged .\nSome members of the House and Senate hid , while others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died .\nFar more , including 140 police officers , were injured .\nWhat happened on January 6 , 2021 has aptly been termed an insurrection \u2014 a violent attempt to overturn the results of a democratic election and , in effect , overthrow the government .\nSince then , an estimated 928 people have been arrested and charged with federal crimes for participating in the attack .\nScores have been convicted .\nBut the man at the center of the insurrection \u2014 Donald Trump \u2014 remains unindicted .\nFar from being held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold on the Republican Party .\nThe \u201c big lie \u201d that the election was stolen has become an article of faith and a driving force for the neo-fascist movement he embodies and leads , posing an existential threat to the survival of democracy .\nIn the immediate aftermath of the insurrection , even after Trump was acquitted in his second impeachment trial , it appeared that justice would come quickly for the former president .\nEven Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , who shamelessly voted for acquittal , predicted a day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impassioned speech on February 13 , 2021 , McConnell told his colleagues that Trump was \u201c practically and morally responsible for provoking \u201d the assault on the Capitol .\n\u201c President Trump is still liable for everything he did , \u201d McConnell declared .\n\u201c He didn \u2019 t get away with anything .\nYet .\nYet .\nWe have a criminal justice system in this country .\nWe have civil litigation .\nAnd former [ presidents ] are not immune from being accountable by either one.\n\u201d It was the second \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that lingers still .\nTo be sure , Trump has been sued civilly many times \u2014 most notably , by New York Attorney General Letitia James in a massive bank and insurance fraud filing unrelated to the insurrection \u2014 but we \u2019 re still waiting for the criminal justice system to drop the hammer .\nThis isn \u2019 t to say that the justice system has been quiet .\nTo the contrary , Trump has attracted the attention of multiple criminal grand juries , and the legal vise appears to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are no signs of an imminent indictment .\nIn part , the holdup may be due to good old-fashioned hand-wringing .\nOver the past few months , a debate has unfolded among legal scholars and commentators about the wisdom of prosecuting Trump and the potential political and social destabilization an indictment could spark .\nReferring to the search at Mar-a-Lago , Trump has warned that the country would face \u201c problems \u2026 the likes of which perhaps we \u2019 ve never seen \u201d if he is indicted .\nPlainly , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the indictment of a former president .\nApart from the rather comical arrest in 1872 of President Ulysses S. Grant by a District of Columbia police officer for driving his carriage through the streets of Georgetown at an excessive speed , no American president has ever been charged with a criminal offense .\nNot Andrew Johnson , not Richard Nixon , not Bill Clinton and not \u2014 at least thus far \u2014 Trump .\nA failed Trump prosecution would be a lose-lose proposition , legally and politically .\nBut the greater risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of law begs for Trump to be held accountable .\nOne of the central myths of American democracy is the principle that no one is above the law .\nThe myth is drilled into us from our earliest days in social studies classes to the platitudes we still hear every July Fourth .\nYet the myth in practice has all too often proven to be just that \u2014 a lofty notion that at best applies to ordinary Americans but allows the rich and powerful to do exactly as they please with few adverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall into despair at the lack of resolution , there are three good reasons to maintain hope .\nOne of them is a county-level Georgia district attorney named Fani Willis .\nThis past May , the Fulton County D.A .\nconvened a special grand jury to investigate Trump and others for trying to alter the state \u2019 s 2020 election results .\nIn an interview with The Washington Post in September , Willis said her office had examined about \u201c 65 % of the dozens of witnesses \u201d she wants to question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impressive .\nIn June , Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger , whom Trump pressured to \u201c find \u201d an additional \u201c 11780 votes , \u201d took the stand .\nTwo months later , she grilled Rudi Giuliani and attorney John Eastman , a former law school dean and clerk for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas who is generally credited with devising the legal framework for Trump \u2019 s attempted coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat .\nAnd Willis remains determined to move forward , waging dogged legal battles with Sen. Lindsey Graham , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last chief of staff , Mark Meadows to compel them to take the oath , as well .\nWillis also told the Post , \u201c If indicted and convicted , people are facing prison sentences.\n\u201d The decision to subpoena or bring charges against Trump , she added , will be made \u201c late this fall.\n\u201d Unfortunately , under Georgia law , special grand juries are investigatory only .\nThey can not return indictments .\nTo charge Trump or anyone else with state crimes , Willis will have to complete her special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a process that would likely bleed over into 2023 .\nA second front is active in New York City , where the Trump Organization is currently on trial for running an alleged 15-year conspiracy to commit tax fraud .\nIn August , Allen Weisselberg , the company \u2019 s chief financial officer , pleaded guilty to the same charges .\nUnder the terms of his plea bargain , Weisselberg will serve five months in jail instead of a long prison term .\nHe will also testify as the prosecution \u2019 s star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found guilty , it could face stiff financial penalties .\nBut the case has nothing to do with Trump \u2019 s conduct as president , and in any event , Trump personally has not been indicted .\nIn April , Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg , who is in charge of the prosecution , opted to suspend a grand jury probe against Trump himself .\nA win against Trump \u2019 s company , however , could prompt Bragg to reopen the probe .\nThen there are the ongoing ( and accelerating ) investigations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A grand jury is investigating Trump for absconding from the Oval Office with a trove of classified and top-secret documents and stashing them at his Mar-a-Lago beach and golf resort in Palm Beach , Florida \u2014 potentially violating a section of the Espionage Act and two other federal criminal statutes that prohibit the concealment or removal of federal records , and the destruction , mutilation or alteration of records to obstruct a federal investigation .\nThe statutes prescribe punishments ranging from three to 20 years in prison .\nAccording to The Washington Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mar-a-Lago contain sensitive information on Iran \u2019 s missile program and U.S. intel on China .\nIt \u2019 s hard to imagine any legitimate purpose Trump had for taking and retaining such items .\nHowever , progress in the investigation has been slowed by a set of arguably incompetent rulings issued by U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Mercedes Cannon , including one appointing a special master to review the Mar-a-Lago search .\nA 41-year-old with no trial experience as a lawyer but enthusiastically endorsed by the Federalist Society , Cannon was nominated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some Democratic votes ) by McConnell \u2019 s lame-duck Republican-controlled Senate on November 13 , 2020 .\nA second federal grand jury is reportedly examining Trump \u2019 s part in the plan to create fake slates of electors in seven swing states .\nThe federal probe overlaps with Willis \u2019 investigation , but is even broader .\nA third federal grand jury is looking into the fundraising practices of Trump \u2019 s Save America leadership PAC during the last election .\nMost critically of all , the Department of Justice has expanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump \u2019 s involvement in the attack and the possibility of charging him and other high-ranking aides with seditious conspiracy , incitement of insurrection and obstruction of Congress .\nFor the time being , however , the DOJ is focused on the rioters who physically breached the Capitol , and in particular , the Oath Keepers militia group .\nFive members of the group are on trial in Washington , D.C. , for seditious conspiracy .\nThe case is expected to conclude later this month .\nShould the DOJ prevail , the prospects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve significantly .\nFinally , there are the hearings conducted by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack .\nIn a historic step taken on October 21 , the committee issued a subpoena to Trump , directing him to appear for questioning on Nov. 14 , either in person or via video link .\nTrump has boasted that he might comply if his appearance is broadcast live .\nMore likely , he will fight the subpoena in court to avoid committing perjury or taking the Fifth , hoping the panel will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes over the House in the midterm elections .\nDelay is often Trump \u2019 s preferred legal strategy .\nUntil the committee is dissolved , it will have the option of referring Trump to the DOJ for prosecution , as it did with Steve Bannon , who was subsequently tried and convicted of contempt of Congress , and sentenced to serve four months in jail , pending resolution of his appeal .\nBut such referrals are non-binding , and there is no assurance the DOJ would heed a Trump referral .\nThe final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merrick Garland .\nGarland , Willis and Bragg \u2014 the names sound like the partners of a high-profile law office \u2014 have an historic opportunity to breathe some much-needed life into the embattled but bedrock American ideal of equal treatment under the law .\nThey must act , and the sooner the better .\nWhat \u2019 s left of our tattered and very imperfect democracy hangs in the balance .", "author": "Bill Blum", "url":

higher .\nIf the Republicans take back either the House or Senate tomorrow , the stage will be set for Donald Trump \u2019 s return in 2024 .\nIf that happens , there will be few , if any , guardrails left to preserve what is left of our damaged and fraying democracy .\nSince 2016 , the MAGA movement Trump leads has morphed from a retrograde white nationalist crusade to a full-blown neo-fascist force .\nThis fact will become all-too apparent in a MAGA Congress led by Marjorie Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the House side , and Ron Johnson , Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz in the upper chamber .\nThink of a media landscape dominated by an ascendant Steve Bannon and Breitbart as the MAGA movement drowns out what few dissident voices remain within the GOP .\nAll that is on the line tomorrow .\nAnd don \u2019 t count on the courts if Trump returns to power .\nThe legal system , already infested by jurists hand-picked by the Federalist Society , will offer fewer and fewer safeguards as the movement undertakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil rights , environmental protection , trade-union rights , women \u2019 s rights and all vestiges of what it derisively refers to as the \u201c administrative state.\n\u201d We are at an inflection point in our history where the choice confronting us is one between democracy \u2014 with all of its frailties and shortcomings \u2014 and a renewed and revitalized fascism .\nFascism is a loaded term , but if used correctly , it applies to Trumpism .\nIn his seminal study , \u201c The Anatomy of Fascism , \u201d Robert Paxton listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obsessive preoccupation with community decline , humiliation or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity , energy and purity , in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants , working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites , abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.\n\u201d Trump and Trumpism similarly embody the 14 common factors of fascism identified by the great Italian writer Umberto Eco in his 1995 essay , \u201c Ur Fascism \u201d : \u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than technological ) .\n\u2022 A cult of action for its own sake and a distrust of intellectualism .\n\u2022 A framing of disagreement or opposition as treasonous .\n\u2022 A fear of difference .\nFascism is racist by definition .\n\u2022 An appeal to a frustrated middle class \u2014 either due to economic or political pressures from both above and below .\n\u2022 An obsession with the plots and machinations of the movement \u2019 s identified enemies .\n\u2022 A requirement that said enemies be simultaneously seen as omnipotent and weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selective populism , relying on chauvinist definitions of \u201c the people \u201d that it claims to speak for .\n\u2022 A heavy usage of Newspeak \u2014 impoverished vocabulary , elementary syntax and a resistance to complex and critical reasoning .\nAs the current situation demonstrates , fascism is by no means a foreign phenomenon restricted to South American banana republics or failed European states .\nAs University of London professor Sarah Churchwell explained in a June 22 , 2020 essay published in the New York Review of Books , fascism has deep roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s and extending to the rise of the German-American Bund in the 1930s to the ascendance of Depression-era demagogues like Huey Long , and the election of Trump in 2016 .\nChurchwell \u2019 s article is fittingly titled , \u201c American Fascism : It Has Happened Here.\n\u201d In it , she offers yet another working definition of fascism , noting that while fascist movements differ from nation to nation , they are united by \u201c conspicuous features [ that ] are recognizably shared.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] ostalgia for a purer , mythic , often rural past ; cults of tradition and cultural regeneration ; paramilitary groups ; the delegitimizing of political opponents and demonization of critics ; the universalizing of some groups as authentically national , while dehumanizing all other groups ; hostility to intellectualism and attacks on a free press ; anti-modernism ; fetishized patriarchal masculinity ; and a distressed sense of victimhood and collective grievance .\nFascist mythologies often incorporate a notion of cleansing , an exclusionary defense against racial or cultural contamination , and related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 over others.\n\u201d No one has summarized the perils of Trumpism with more insight than the celebrated linguist and political commentator Noam Chomsky .\nIn a June 2021 interview with Truthout , Chomsky remarked : \u201c The term \u2018 neoliberal proto-fascism \u2019 captures well both the features of the current [ Republican ] party and the distinction from the fascism of the past .\nThe commitment to the most brutal form of neoliberalism is apparent in the legislative record , crucially the subordination of the party to private capital , the inverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms are there , including extreme racism , violence , worship of the leader ( sent by God , according to former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ) , immersion in a world of \u2018 alternative facts \u2019 and a frenzy of irrationality.\n\u201d In light of the looming election , it is worth recalling a searing 2016 column by Adolph Reed Jr. , in which the renowned political scientist urged readers to \u201c Vote for the Lying Neoliberal Warmonger : It \u2019 s Important.\n\u201d Reed argued that the dangers of allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so great , the American left had no choice but to hold its collective nose and keep Trump out of office by voting for Hillary Clinton , a politician Reed plainly despised .\nTo drive home his message , Reed cited an article written by Harold Meyerson for theAmerican Prospect , in which Meyerson compared the political climate of 2016 in the United States to Germany in the early 1930s .\nAs the Nazi Party gained strength those many decades ago , the Communist Party , led by Ernst Thalmann , refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Democrats against Hitler , believing the Social Democrats to be a greater threat to the working class than the fascists .\nWe all know too well what tragedies followed .\nSo do your part , and vote .", "author": "Bill Blum", "url": "https://www.truthdig.com/articles/democracy-on-the-ballot/", "published": "Mon, 07 Nov 2022 23:57:15 +0000",

wife Janet and I splurged on tickets to a spellbinding concert by the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra .\nThe music was memorable , as was an offhand comment by orchestra leader and trumpet virtuoso Wynton Marsalis .\nIntroducing a blues number , Marsalis suggested that the blues should be America \u2019 s national anthem .\nThe audience laughed .\nBut I took this as a serious and brilliant suggestion .\nIt \u2019 s worth some discussion .\nThe blues is a uniquely American ( at first solely African American ) musical form .\nUnlike minstrel tunes and cakewalks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the dominant culture to parody and demean African Americans ; nor was it , like ragtime , adapted by Blacks from popular Euro-American dance forms like the march or the two-step .\nInstead , it erupted directly as a raw response to degrading conditions forced upon resilient , creative people by the deeply racist society that had kidnapped and enslaved their ancestors .\nIn both form and expression , the blues was startlingly original .\nAnd , in its first iterations , there was almost nothing commercial about it .\nThe blues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably around the time of the Civil War .\nHowever , an exact year or place is impossible to pin down .\nIt began as rural , improvised vocal music that invited simple instrumental accompaniment .\nIt quickly caught hold and flourished , persisting alongside spirituals and , later , ragtime .\nIn 1909 , W.C .\nHandy copyrighted what is often cited as the first blues composition , \u201c The Memphis Blues , \u201d but it was not written strictly in the form of a blues , and was preceded by Jelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blues , \u201d composed in 1902 .\nDuring the 1920s , blues singer-composers like Bessie Smith , Mamie Smith and Ma Rainey were so popular that the New York-based commercial tunesmiths of Tin Pan Alley churned out dozens of songs with the word \u201c blues \u201d in their titles \u2014 songs that , in form and spirit , had little to do with real blues .\nThe musical form of the blues is simplicity itself : three chords spread over 12 bars in 4/4 time , with lots of repetitions ( there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extra chords can be judiciously added to provide more musical variety ) .\nIn its essence , the blues is so uncomplicated that any teenage kid with a guitar can get in on the action , as three British lads named Clapton , Page and Richards did in the early 1960s , going on to make fortunes that eluded the Black American blues artists they were imitating .\nWhy would the blues make a great national anthem ?\nFirst , almost anything would be better than our current anthem .\n\u201c The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has lyrics that only a historian can relate to .\nHardly anyone really likes it , though most Americans , when asked , say they \u2019 d prefer to stick with it rather than change to a different song .\nMany of the oft-suggested alternatives are characterized by corny triumphalism or smarmy patriotism ( \u201c America the Beautiful , \u201d \u201c My Country \u2019 Tis of Thee , \u201d or \u201c Columbia the Gem of the Ocean \u201d ) .\nThe best of the front-runners is undoubtedly Woody Guthrie \u2019 s folksy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blues , however , has a lot going for it as a long shot candidate .\nBlues may be America \u2019 s greatest cultural gift to the world ; if not , it \u2019 s certainly on the shortlist .\nIt was the key contributor to the origins of jazz , rock and roll , funk , soul , R & B and hip hop , and it deeply influenced country and western , and bluegrass music .\nWithout blues , it \u2019 s fair to say , there might be little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resilience in the face of adversity and suffering .\nIt \u2019 s therefore the perfect musical tonic for a nation founded on slavery and genocide ( Native Americans have the incentive to play the blues with genuine feeling ; check out Cecil Gray \u2019 s \u201c Native Blues \u201d ) , and a country of extreme economic inequality whose fossil-fueled luck is starting to run out .\nIndeed , Americans will have plenty of reasons to sing the blues as this century wears on \u2014 as their nation \u2019 s oil and gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worsens droughts , wildfires and megastorms ; as decades of unsustainable economic growth turn to decades of contraction ; as mountains of government , corporate and consumer debt come due ; and as festering resentments ( urban/rural , racial and regional ) further erode an already fraying set of norms that enable political and legal systems to function .\nThe key to national survival will be a collective willingness to share the pain ( instead of blaming scapegoats ) , celebrate our common humanity and build a new culture that \u2019 s both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no music more fitting as a soundtrack for that enterprise than the blues .\nOne argument against the blues as America \u2019 s national anthem is simply that blues is more of a musical genre than a specific composition .\nShould a particular blues song be proposed to Congress ?\nIf so , then first consideration should go to the works of Bessie Smith , who wrote and performed many of the most popular blues ballads of the last century .\n( My personal pick would be her \u201c Dirty No-Gooder \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s B.B .\nKing \u2019 s \u201c Every Day I Have the Blues \u201d and Robert Johnson \u2019 s \u201c Hellhound on My Trail.\n\u201d For boomers and rockers , a top choice might be Jimi Hendrix \u2019 s \u201c Voodoo Child.\n\u201d The possibilities are nearly endless .\nBut why should we be required to choose ?\nMaybe each official occasion could open with a different blues song .\nOf course , the chances of Marsalis \u2019 s suggestion being taken up by officials in Washington are virtually nil .\nBut I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicking off with a rousing , full-throated chorus of Willie Dixon \u2019 s \u201c Wang Dang Doodle.\n\u201d In that fantasy future , America might actually redeem itself .", "author":

\u2019 ve heard about the latest collapse to roil the world of cryptocurrency .\nLast month , a sudden liquidity crisis caused something analogous to a \u201c bank run \u201d on Sam Bankman-Fried \u2019 s cryptocurrency exchange platform , FTX , causing its collapse , and wiping out 94 % of the estimated $ 15 billion personal fortune of its 32-year-old CEO .\nVirtually overnight , \u201c SBF \u201d , as he is known , was left with about $ 900 million , although he now reports having only about $ 100,000 in his personal bank account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEC ) and Department of Justice ( DOJ ) have since opened an investigation into whether SBF committed fraud .\nIn brief , SBF used FTX customer funds to support his cryptocurrency trading firm Alameda , which was supposed to be separate .\nThis was done secretively through a \u201c backdoor \u201d in FTX \u2019 s accounting software that enabled FTX to move roughly $ 10 billion to Alameda , which bought large quantities of FTX \u2019 s digital coin , FTT , to support its price by reducing supply .\nAs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion of the funds transferred from FTX to Alameda have gone missing , affecting some 1 million creditors , the biggest 50 of whom are owed almost $ 3.1 billion .\nIf you followed this story , you \u2019 ve likely also heard about \u201c Effective Altruism \u201d ( EA ) , the philosophical movement that benefited from SBF \u2019 s short-lived crypto empire .\nAs news of the FTX collapse spread , one article after another began to pick up on the fact that SBF was one of EA \u2019 s most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to pursue a career on Wall Street \u2014 for Jane Street Capital , where other effective altruists have worked \u2014 and then in crypto , following a 2012 meeting with EA \u2019 s cofounder , a young Oxford University philosophy professor named William MacAskill .\nOver lunch , MacAskill encouraged SBF to pursue the EA life strategy called \u201c earn to give , \u201d whereby one strives to \u2014 quoting a Sequoia profile on SBF\u2014 \u201c get filthy rich , for charity \u2019 s sake , \u201d even if this means working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization [ s ] .\n\u201d Although the means may be questionable , they \u2019 re justified by the ends : maximizing the \u201c good \u201d that one does in the world .\nAs a \u201c filthy rich \u201d public figure , SBF continued to follow the EA handbook \u2014 or so it seemed \u2014 which encourages its followers to be self-sacrificing , frugal and modest .\nThis is based in marketing and public relations no less than a genuine commitment to the idea that , as privileged members of a rich nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forego unnecessary comforts for the sake of \u201c doing good better.\n\u201d But whatever the motive , it pays dividends .\nWhen MacAskill appeared on \u201c The Daily Show \u201d last September to promote his recent book , \u201c What We Owe the Future , \u201d his announcement that he gives away 50 % of his income drew heavy applause .\nSBF , too , benefitted from media accounts that overlooked clear red flags at FTX to focus on his story as the humble crypto tycoon , practically a monk , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shared an apartment with nine roommates , and drove a beat-up Carola .\nA series of revelations since last summer , and especially since the FTX debacle , suggest that this was all , for lack of a better word , a massive grift .\nIn reality , SBF owned a $ 40 million penthouse in the Bahamas , which he called home , and accrued a \u201c local property portfolio worth an estimated three hundred million dollars.\n\u201d Many of these \u201c were luxury beachfront homes , including seven condominiums in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costing almost $ 72 million.\n\u201d SBF flew in private jets and purchased a $ 16.4 million mansion in the Bahamas under his parent \u2019 s name as a \u201c vacation home.\n\u201d FTX employees received free meals and had access to an \u201c in-house Uber-like \u201d transportation service .\nThis is a far cry from the humble lifestyle that EAs , including MacAskill , consistently presented to the public .\nMacAskill , meanwhile , has more money at his fingertips than most of us make in a lifetime .\nLeft unmentioned during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hired several PR firms to promote his book , one of which was paid $ 12,000 per month , according to someone with direct knowledge of the matter .\nMacAskill \u2019 s team , this person tells me , even floated a total promotional budget ceiling of $ 10 million \u2014 a staggering number \u2014 thanks partly to financial support from the tech multibillionaire Dustin Moskovitz , cofounder of Facebook and a major funder of EA .\nIt \u2019 s easy to give away part of your income \u2014 and sound saintly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , say , a mansion in the Bahamas or multimillion-dollar budgets to promote your projects and your brand .\nYet SBF wasn \u2019 t the only disgraced crypto billionaire courted by MacAskill and EA .\nAs Kerry Vaughan reports , MacAskill earlier described Ben Delo \u201c by name as an important new EA donor , \u201d with Delo becoming a member of Giving What We Can , cofounded by MacAskill , in 2019 .\nThat same year , he entered into a partnership with the EA-aligned organization Open Philanthropy , \u201c providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million per year range , to support \u201d the organization \u2019 s mission .\nThe EA community considered him to be \u201c a major EA donor.\n\u201d In 2020 , Delo was charged with \u201c willfully failing to establish , implement and maintain an anti-money laundering ( \u201c AML \u201d ) program at BitMEX , \u201d a derivative trading and cryptocurrency exchange platform , and is currently serving 30 months probation after agreeing to a $ 10 million monetary penalty .\nZooming out , the EA movement so lavishly funded by SBF , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortage of additional funds .\nJust two months ago , before the FTX implosion , EA boasted of a whopping $ 46.1 billion in committed money , much of it from SBF .\nYet even without SBF \u2019 s and Delo \u2019 s contributions , Open Philanthropy reports that it still has literally \u201c billions of dollars \u201d to give away \u201c over the coming decades.\n\u201d As Nitasha Tiku reports in The Washington Post , Open Philanthropy has already dished out $ 255.8 million for \u201c longtermist \u201d causes like preventing superintelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poured some $ 234 million back into the EA community itself , for what it calls \u201c movement building.\n\u201d The community has so much money that the Oxford-based Centre for Effective Altruism , which MacAskill co-founded , recently bought \u201c a palatial estate near Oxford \u201d called Whytham Abbey , which includes an enormous , sumptuous building constructed sometime in the 15th century .\nThe reasoning here is that , according to a New Yorker article , such expenditures \u2014 including thousands spent on retreats at Wytham Abbey \u2014 are worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bankman-Fried.\n\u201d In the wake of the FTX debacle and the profound reputational damage it \u2019 s done to EA , many of the movement \u2019 s leaders have declared that things like \u201c integrity \u201d and \u201c common-sense morality \u201d have always been integral to the EA worldview .\nHence , SBF \u2019 s behaviors \u2014 if indeed fraudulent \u2014 are a flagrant violation of everything EA stands for .\n\u201c For years , \u201d MacAskill tweeted , \u201c the EA community has emphasized the importance of integrity , honesty and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding that \u201c a clear-thinking EA should strongly oppose \u2018 ends justify the means \u2019 reasoning.\n\u201d Similarly , the Centre for Effective Altruism wrote that \u201c effective altruism requires integrity , \u201d and thus , \u201c if Sam Bankman-Fried , and other FTX executives , were involved in lying to , or defrauding , customers then they were not acting in accordance with the principles of effective altruism.\n\u201d It \u2019 s difficult to take any of this seriously .\nIf there \u2019 s a single theme that \u2019 s been promoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s that the ends justify the means .\nThis has , in fact , been one of the main criticisms leveled at EA for years .\nEven the way EAs talk about the importance of integrity , honesty and common-sense morality comes across as strategic , rather than sincere : the reason community members should exemplify integrity and the rest is that it \u2019 s expedient for achieving their ends .\nFake it , because that \u2019 s a good way to make it .\nAs one EA wrote in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c should probably avoid moralizing where possible , or doing anything else that might accidentally turn people off .\nThe goal should be to present ourselves as something society obviously regards as good , so we should generally conform to social norms.\n\u201d If integrity mattered , MacAskill wouldn \u2019 t have told young people like SBF to work on Wall Street and in crypto .\nHe wouldn \u2019 t have argued that there \u2019 s nothing morally wrong with working for a \u201c petrochemical company \u201d so long as you donate part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was \u201c integrity \u201d when EAs like MacAskill continued to align themselves with SBF\u2014even after SBF described DeFi , which he invested and traded in , as a Ponzi scheme ?\nWhere was \u201c honesty \u201d when MacAskill misled , by omission , his Daily Show audience into thinking that giving away half his income was a personal sacrifice ?\nWhere was \u201c common-sense morality \u201d when EAs urged people in the Global North to support sweatshops in the Global South ?\nWhere was this opposition to \u201c means-ends reasoning \u201d when someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is highly selective of its speakers , literally argued that we should consider investing \u201c in evil to do more good \u201d ?\nAnd where was any of this when MacAskill sent private text messages to Elon Musk \u2014 a man known for his transphobic tweets , Covid misinformation and casual sexism \u2014 suggesting that Musk should actually buy Twitter with SBF ?\nIn truth , the EA community has always lacked integrity , honesty and common sense .\nThis was , in fact , a core component of its brand .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive to \u201c moral weirdos , \u201d a term that MacAskill uses endearingly .\nThe about-face in the fallout of FTX \u2019 s implosion , with EAs now claiming to care about things like integrity , is just more evidence that the community is a relentless grift .\nIt has billions in the bank , a palatial estate in Oxfordshire , and links to some of the richest people on the planet .\nHundreds of millions of dollars are poured back into the community for \u201c movement building , \u201d and leading EAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-sacrificing \u2014 flew in private jets , bought hundreds of millions in Bahamian real estate , and were offered literally millions , from tech billionaires , to boost book sales .\nIf you want to do good in the world \u2014 and you should \u2014 steer clear of EA .", "author":

a few have attractive architectural designs .\nI know them well because I drive , walk and run through the neighborhood every day .\nSome of my new neighbors are pleasant and available for conversation .\nMany others are interested solely in holding the property long enough to \u201c flip \u201d it at a considerable profit , one of the most conspicuous forms of economic \u201c development \u201d in the region in recent years .\nEach time I see the sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variant , I think about the charming house about to be taken down on my street or nearby , and frown .\nI know that this is also a common reaction among many of the other longtime Mar Vista residents .\nExcept for some anti-mansion signs and occasional graffiti , there is little opposition to the growing gentrification .\nPolitical opposition in the Los Angeles City Council seems fruitless and no genuine relief from this urban carcinogenic tendency appears likely .\nLos Angeles is mired in contentious politics and scandal , putting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the proverbial back burner , where it is unlikely to make major inroads in the corridors of municipal political power .\nInto this void , a street artist named Lori Powers has recently emerged with a public response in the forms of 22 whimsical public sculptures .\nPlaced on telephone poles along two major East-West thoroughfares in the neighborhood , her imaginative works provide a wondrous visual experience to pedestrians , bike riders and drivers .\nMy personal reaction is common .\nEach time I walk , run or drive on these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because my personal reaction has broader significance .\nThese public artworks cumulatively continue a long Los Angeles tradition of profound street art as a response to social issues .\nTo be sure , gentrification in Mar Vista and much of the region may not rise to the level of continuing police misconduct and brutality against people of color and a multitude of other more egregious political , social and economic problems .\nLori Powers \u2019 work is not directly political in the sense that the content of her work is more whimsical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change the world a little bit.\n\u201d Her artworks are socially meaningful in a truly remarkable way : They engage their audiences and often encourage them to reflect on broader social concerns .\nThat fulfills one of the highest functions of socially conscious art .\nFor decades , graffiti writers have used walls and other public and private surfaces to express their deeply felt grievances .\nThis was especially the case regarding the obvious racism in Los Angeles , where African Americans were subjected to police brutality and surveillance reminiscent of apartheid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graffiti is undeniably destructive , other street artists , calling themselves \u201c writers , \u201d use their spray cans to express pride in their neighborhoods and their ethnic and racial heritages .\nThey also call attention to various inequities and injustices .\nAs Jim Prigoff and other commentators have noted , these expressions are also serious visual commentaries about life and public affairs .\nFollowing the historic Watts Rebellion of 1965 , iconic African American artists including Noah Purifoy , John Outterbridge , Betye Saar , Joe Sims , Charles Dickson , Dominique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history by turning \u201c trash into treasure , \u201d creating a new genre of assemblage art in the process .\nTheir works collectively used found materials to offer trenchant commentary about racial and class inequities in Los Angeles and throughout America .\nMore recently , Shepard Fairey and Robbie Conal have gained international fame as poster artists known for their \u201c unlawful \u201d works .\nFairey , whose \u201c OBEY \u201d and \u201c HOPE \u201d ( for the first Obama campaign ) has garnered continued attention for his posters and murals .\nLikewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of \u201c guerrilla \u201d art ; his iconic posters lambasting the reactionary Supreme Court members , among many other right-wing targets , have kept him in the public limelight .\nAs with these predecessors , Powers has no formal permit from city authorities ; she simply stakes out her sites , sets up her ladder and attaches the prefabricated work .\nThe result is especially evocative of the folk art of Simon Rodia , creator of the internationally famous Watts Towers .\nThat is also a powerful and enduring tradition , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the United States and throughout the entire world .\nPowers came to art later in life , approximately six years ago , approximately at the start of the latest wave of gentrification .\nBut this was not her motivation ; she simply sought an outlet for her creative impulses .\nIf anything , the wave of horrific American school shootings provided one motivation for her turn to art .\nAfter 30 years of working in software development , she moved to the Los Angeles area from New England , where she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs she experimented with welding and fabricating materials foraged from the alleys and other locales in Mar Vista , she discovered her passion for public street art .\nThese works have been appearing in the past few years and have intensified during the pandemic .\nPowers collects the ingredients of her art \u2014 chairs , rugs , magnets \u2014 from discarded or donated materials , and assembles them into an intriguing whole in her backyard studio on a quiet residential street only a few blocks from my own .\nHer studio is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her front lawn , which is full of sculptural pieces from similar found materials she has scrounged or discovered .\nThese works are highly colorful and immediately catch the attention of passersby .\nWhen Powers completes a sculpture , she proceeds to the telephone pole she has selected .\nAt first , she worked late at night to avoid public exposure , sometimes donning a fake beard to conceal her identity .\nEventually , she abandoned this ruse and began erecting her public artworks during the day , in full sight of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSometimes she uses an assistant , but in all cases the artworks are securely attached to ensure that they will not fall and injure anyone .\nNo instances of any failures in this area have been reported to date .\nOnly a few examples of opposition to her efforts have occurred since she commenced her public art project .\nShe showed me , for example , a fairly long letter from a resident who threatened to alert the city authorities and demanded that her works be removed from the neighborhood telephone poles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the tone suggested a deeper , more inexplicable hostility .\nI found the letter a sad but extremely unusual response ; fortunately , even if the writer actually followed through with the threats , no formal municipal action has been forthcoming .\nI witnessed a second act of hostility while jogging through the neighborhood , when a car with a young woman driver complained that she objected to the work and demanded that it be taken down from the pole .\nFor all of my long career writing about art and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on works that specifically address social and political misconduct and injustice like racism , sexism , homophobia , war , poverty , class oppression and similar themes .\nPowers \u2019 works are different yet share a life-affirming commitment to bring joy to viewers and encourage them to seek creativity within themselves .\nThere is plenty of room for that feature of visual art in addition to trenchant social criticism .\nThe human condition is complex and people need hope for their spirits to maintain the healthy indignation at the root of all social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculptures can not stop the advance of gentrification or the real estate bonanza enriching the most affluent population of Los Angeles .\nBut they are a welcome sign of joyful resistance , or perhaps at least a few moments of quiet reflection among some viewers , one small step in that direction .", "author": "Paul Von Blum", "url": "https://www.truthdig.com/articles/where-gentrification-meets-joyful-resistance/", "published": "Wed, 14 Dec 2022 00:10:20 +0000", "published_utc": 1670994620, "collection_utc": 1670977124}, {"id": "truthdig--2022-12-15--FTX Bankman-Fried Arrested", "date": "2022-12-15", "source": "truthdig", "title": "FTX Bankman-Fried Arrested", "content": "You may also like", "author": "Staff", "url": "https://www.truthdig.com/cartoons/ftx-bankman-fried-arrested/", "published": "Thu, 15 Dec 2022 16:52:02 +0000", "published_utc": 1671141122, "collection_utc": 1671149618}, {"id": "truthdig--2022-12-15--Keystone Pipeline Leak", "date": "2022-12-15", "source": "truthdig", "title": "Keystone Pipeline Leak", "content": "You may also like", "author": "Staff", "url": "https://www.truthdig.com/cartoons/keystone-pipeline-leak/", "published": "Thu, 15 Dec 2022 16:49:58 +0000", "published_utc": 1671140998, "collection_utc": 1671149619}, {"id": "truthdig--2022-12-15--Biden Signs Gay Marriage Law", "date": "2022-12-15", "source": "truthdig", "title": "Biden Signs Gay Marriage Law", "content": "You may also like", "author": "Staff", "url": "https://www.truthdig.com/cartoons/biden-signs-gay-marriage-law/", "published": "Thu, 15 Dec 2022 16:48:23 +0000", "published_utc": 1671140903, "collection_utc": 1671149618}, {"id": "truthdig--2022-12-16--Ken Burns\u2019 Other Lens", "date": "2022-12-16", "source": "truthdig", "title": "Ken Burns\u2019 Other Lens", "content": "Ken Burns , the country \u2019 s most prominent television documentarian , turns from the screen to the page with \u201c Our America , A Photographic History \u201d ( Alfred A. Knopf ) .\nThe book continues Burns \u2019 long and signature obsession with the American story , covering 180 years of history with roughly 250 black and white photographs taken between 1839 to 2019 .\nThe lavishly illustrated volume ranges chronologically across famed figures , ordinary people , landscapes and cityscapes , momentous events , and day-to-day life .\nThe curated images\u2014drawn

accumulated history \u201d of the land he \u2019 s been chronicling onscreen for more than 40 years .\nIn contrast to the propulsive pacing of his Emmy and Oscar-winning films , \u201c Our America \u201d allows the reader to linger and ponder over the images and their own American backstories .\nBy highlighting the men and women behind the photographs , the book also serves as an annual of American shutterbugs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke with Burns by phone about \u201c Our America , \u201d his favorite photographers , contemporary controversies around race , and more .\n\u201c Our America \u201d is your first book not tied to one of your documentaries .\nWhy ?\nIt was a way to go back to my roots .\nMy father was an amateur still photographer , I was trained by still photographers , particularly Jerome Liebling , and the still photographs within my films are the DNA of what we do , the building blocks that let us communicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documentary world , I control how long you look at that photograph .\nI zoom in , I isolate , I direct it , but I like the purity of the old Aperture monographs and other photography books that have only one photograph per page , minimal captions and allows you to spend as much time as you wanted with the photograph .\nI love that .\nAnd I wanted to do something about it that would be the history of the United States , both uppercase ( U.S. ) and lowercase ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was to start with the first selfie , a self-portrait [ of Louis Daguerre ] from 1839 , the year photography was invented , and to proceed more or less to the present .\nWe designed it in a way so the photographs might talk to each other visually , intuitively , obviously , structurally , politically , whatever it might be and we just allowed them to have , if you will , conversations between themselves .\nThe book not only pays attention to the subjects of the photos , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTell us about some of your favorite photographers in \u201c Our America.\n\u201d I would start with Lewis Hine and , of course , my mentor , Jerome Liebling .\nWith the case of Lewis Hine , he \u2019 s looking at all of us .\nYou can extend that then into the Depression era , with Ben Shahn , Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans and others represented in the book are out looking at America for the Farm Security Administration , led by Roy Stryker .\nHe was just saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d in the same way that I say \u201c our.\n\u201d That is to say , warts and all .\nWhatever you can find .\nThe book discusses different schools of photography , from the \u201c Pictorialism \u201d of Karl Struss , to the \u201c Straight Photography \u201d advocated by Paul Strand .\nWhat do you prefer ?\nThe latter .\nPaul Strand is one of my favorite photographers .\nThere are many other things that are done \u2014 you have the modernist and manipulation shots of [ Robert ] Heinecken and Minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now , abstractions by Carl Chiarenza and others .\nI \u2019 m not saying they \u2019 re not good .\nI wanted my book to be more straight , representational , photorealist , more social documentary in its gaze .\nAlthough you can see a variety of things , in the landscapes and intimate pictures of a pussywillow branch or girls dancing for joy or an interior of the New York City subway .\nSome of them are just saying , \u201c This was , \u201d in essence , this is .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph by superimposing on it the label of the particular school it may or may not subscribe to .\nJackson Pollock did representational paintings and then he did the epitome of Abstract Expressionism and non-representational painting .\nWhat I want to do is be open enough in my view that I can include all sorts of things .\nThere are all kinds of people , all of them American .\nWhether you \u2019 re making a film about baseball , war or the Central Park Five , and now in \u201c Our America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your work .\nWhy do you think that race is so central to American history ?\nBecause any serious dive runs into race .\nJust think of the moment of our birth \u2014 we know exactly where we were born , Philadelphia , we know exactly why \u2014 the second sentence of the Declaration , \u201c We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.\n\u201d I can stop right there , because the guy who wrote these words owned hundreds of human beings and did not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was an attempt to create this pseudo-science called eugenics , which postulated there was a hierarchy of races .\nAt the top of which you could find a white Protestant Nordic races of Northern Europe .\nAryans , Hitler would and did say .\nBut there \u2019 s only one race , there \u2019 s only one race , Ed , and that \u2019 s the human race .\nOn the cover of \u201c Our America \u201d is a little Black boy .\nHow would you describe America \u2019 s current racial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I could characterize it .\nIt \u2019 s always changing and always different , always moving forward , moving backward .\nObviously , we felt since the murder of George Floyd , which was not a one-off occurrence \u2014 hundreds , thousands of African Americans have been murdered at the hands of policemen over the decades .\nBut we are in a racial reckoning and at the same time we arrived in not just anti-Semitic , but other racist tropes and that \u2019 s quite a disturbing trend .\nThe choices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this moment , they \u2019 re to speak to all of American history .\nAnd that particular photograph is one of my most favorite of all time .\nIt was taken by my mentor , Jerome Liebling , who taught me at Hampshire College in Amherst , Massachusetts , a wildly wonderful , experimental school that \u2019 s still thriving and bringing in incredibly new and curious students every year .\nIt was a way to honor him but it was also a way to say , \u201c You know that photograph of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last photograph taken of him , the most beautiful photograph with a face that seems to have seen what these United States had been through before and were going through at that moment near the very end of the Civil War , and in some ways where it was going , it \u2019 s a singularly beautiful photograph , by Alexander Gardner .\nYet , I \u2019 d say that in America , the ideal America , the 16th president is equal to this anonymous kid on the streets of New York whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knots with laces that are broken a few times .\nAt that moment they \u2019 re equals .\nYou don \u2019 t get a photograph like that if you feel somehow above or perhaps below your subject in any way .\nIt \u2019 s a marvelous reflection on our potentiality as a people , as a country , as a republic , as well as a way for me to honor this most significant of teachers in my life .\nThere is a lot of talk in today \u2019 s public discourse about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards and legislatures banning books .\nHave your works been subject to these controversies or threats of censorship ?\nNot overtly .\nI don \u2019 t know what \u201c Critical Race Theory \u201d is .\nI believe it \u2019 s a graduate legal studies thing .\nIt means race is there .\nI \u2019 m in the storytelling business .\nI \u2019 m not in the theoretical expository business .\nI \u2019 m disappointed in a country with a First Amendment as its first amendment that there would be any sort of notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sanitizing it .\nIf you \u2019 re exceptional , as the United States keeps telling itself and the world , you have to be more critical of yourself .\nThe novelist Richard Powers said : \u201c The best arguments in the world won \u2019 t change a single person \u2019 s point of view .\nThe only thing that can do that is a good story.\n\u201d And I \u2019 m trying the best I can to tell this story.\\ Do you think of yourself as an activist ?\nA spectator ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 re trying to make something , it \u2019 s storytelling .\nStorytelling is an active way of editing human experience and we try awfully hard to not put our thumb on the scale with regard to our own political beliefs for things .\nThe films are an attempt to share the complexities .\nI have in my editing room a neon sign in lowercase cursive that says : \u201c It \u2019 s complicated.\n\u201d It \u2019 s there to just remind all of us that that scene you think is working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to find contradictory evidence .\nAnd we \u2019 re going to have to change it .\nAnd you have to be ready to change it .\nEven if it makes it a less perfect scene .\nI.F .\nStone said : \u201c History is not a melodrama , it \u2019 s a tragedy.\n\u201d And it is \u2014 none of us get out of it alive .\nI think what he means is that in melodrama , every villain is perfectly villainous , every hero is perfectly virtuous .\nThat \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In life , the hero has scenes to play and the villain has interesting human aspects .\nSo , it behooves us to tell interesting stories .\nThat \u2019 s why I resist the \u201c warts and all , \u201d because it seems to just favor that it will bring up negative stuff .\nThe book is a series of photographs that in their totality are wonderfully joyous and at the same time it \u2019 s sobering because , yup , this is who we are , too .\nDo you aspire for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I don \u2019 t want to prescribe it .\nI don \u2019 t want to say : \u201c This is what your response should be.\n\u201d If Richard Powers is right , and the only thing that can change a person \u2019 s mind is a good story and not an argument , what you do is you tell a good story , not knowing how it will be received with you or somebody else .\nSo , maybe a film is transformational ?\nLike the people who got up off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went and visited battlefields .\nMany kids at that time were so influenced that they went into history and were teachers or professors .\nThat \u2019 s transformational .\nBy working largely with PBS , which is in part government-funded , have you encountered constraints ?\nPBS is not U.S. government-funded .\nFewer than 18 % of PBS \u2019 money comes from the federal government .\nThat comes from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting , which I do get funds from .\nI have never run into any instances of that .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill .\nI \u2019 m often called to testify on behalf of continuing funding for the National Endowment for the Humanities and Arts and for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting .\nI wholly believe in it and all of my films have gone out on PBS .\nNot just that there \u2019 s no commercials , that \u2019 s kind of obvious , but because they give me the time to do it .\nI can walk into a premium cable place or a streaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u201c I want to make a film on the Vietnam War , \u201d and they \u2019 d say \u201c Great !\n\u201d And , \u201c I need $ 30 million , \u201d and they \u2019 d say \u201c fine.\n\u201d In one day , I could walk out with that , instead of spending seven years fundraising for the Vietnam series .\nBut what they wouldn \u2019 t give me is the creative freedom I enjoy , and more important , the time it took .\nIt took Lynn Novick and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to make that series on the Vietnam War\u2026 Nobody \u2019 s peering over our shoulders , tapping their feet , saying : \u201c Ooh , don \u2019 t make it this way , don \u2019 t make it that way.\n\u201d So , that creative control has meant everything , and the time , the ability to incubate these projects is just a godsend .\nTo paraphrase a Zen k\u014dan about a tree falling in the forest : If a historical event occurred but nobody remembers and/or discusses it , did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s an interesting question .\nThis has a human arrogance to it .\nOf course , it made a sound .\nIf there was a bird nearby it would flutter away .\nWhat we \u2019 re talking about is the way in which parts of the past can get lost , and do , often .\nIt \u2019 s not so much \u2014 there \u2019 s always a witness to something that happens .\nIt \u2019 s just a question of whether you \u2019 re favoring those kinds of witnesses .\nEach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path that makes their present more understandable .\nAlmost every film I \u2019 ve made rhymes , echoes , resonates in some way with what \u2019 s going on right now .\nWho is in the last photo of \u201c Our America \u201d and why ?\nOne day Susie came excited and said : \u201c Look at this !\n\u201d I knew John Lewis for decades , I admired him , he was a hero of mine .\nI spoke with him every year .\nIt \u2019 s a beautiful picture of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to honor him and the sense of how much work there is still to do and how much work has been done .\nThis book is a mirror .\nWe \u2019 ve got everything planned out over this decade .\nSeveral films on the American buffalo , our first non-American topic on Leonardo Da Vinci .\nI spent all this week working on a big series of the history of the American Revolution .\nWe \u2019 re doing something on the history of Reconstruction called \u201c Emancipation to Exodus.\n\u201d We \u2019 ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of LBJ and the Great Society .\nThat takes us through most of the decade .\nIf I was given 1,000 years ,

Movement \u2014 landed him on the wrong side of the Iranian government , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since , along the way re-defining what it means to be an activist storyteller .\n\u201c This Is Not A Film , \u201d which he shot while under house arrest , made its way to the Cannes Film Festival on a flash drive which had been hidden inside a cake .\nSelf-reflexivity has become a key fixture of his work , and by turning the camera on himself , he exposes surprising vulnerabilities .\nThere is courage in centering himself as the object of his dissident gaze ( the fictitious Panahi of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real Panahi does not ) , as well as an element of self-criticism , in particular the way he contrasts his educated metropolitan upbringing with the villages he often favors as backdrops .\nHis own parents hailed from similar settings as the Azerbaijani-speaking villages that appear here and in two recent of his films , \u201c 3 Faces \u201d and the 2020 short \u201c Hidden.\n\u201d Each of these explore , in at least some minute way , a cultural and generational clash with the filmmaker \u2019 s own familial origins .\nPanahi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his own experiences .\nIn \u201c No Bears , \u201d his struggles are flashpoints leading to extrapolation , often in the form of polite conversations that conceal as much as they reveal .\nDespite their physical stillness , these dialogue-heavy scenes are never dramatically stagnant .\nVillage elders approach Panahi for help in gathering evidence against the young couple , who he may have photographed together without realizing the consequences .\nThe villagers speak to him with respectful deference , especially the kindly Ghanbar ( Vahid Mobaseri ) , in whose spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHe \u2019 s left trapped between respecting them and their customs in return ( he is their guest , after all , implicitly under their protection ) , and helping a pair of youngsters who , like him , are trapped by the political circumstances of their birth .\nElsewhere , the tale of Zara and Bakhtiar unfolds with a similarly withheld tone .\nThe ever-increasing hurdles surrounding their impending escape form deeply personal wedges between them , marked by anger and sorrow , which they attempt to hide from the fictitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , participants in the uplifting story he wants to tell , despite the way reality plays out for them .\nHowever , the real Panahi knows the labyrinthine complications of that reality ; when the couple aren \u2019 t filming for his movie-within-a-movie , he captures their slowly-burgeoning fears , which emerge from behind their resolute fa\u00e7ades in private moments .\nPanahi knows the personal toll that dissidence takes , an idea we also see expressed on his own face in fleeting moments .\nFor all the accolades and praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a director , there \u2019 s scant conversation about the work he \u2019 s done as an actor for the last decade .\nHe \u2019 s directed himself to performances so naturalistic that one can forget he \u2019 s performing , too , creating a version of himself who tries to stay at a dignified remove from other people .\nSometimes , this version ends up snapping \u2014 and thus revealing the cracks that form under the pressures of fighting power , and failing .\n( Panahi \u2019 s son , Panah Panahi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these issues in 2022 \u2019 s \u201c Hit the Road.\n\u201d ) Enhancing the drama in \u201c No Bears \u201d is the fact that much of it unfolds near the Iran-Turkey border .\nIn fact , several scenes are set at the border line itself , creating a quiet intensity around the question of whether Panahi could leave if he wanted to .\nPerhaps he could \u2014 both \u201c Hit The Road \u201d and the documentary within \u201c No Bears \u201d are about this exact perilous journey .\nThat he chooses not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hopes to achieve by fighting to enact change from within , through his camera .\nSince the making of this film , Panahi has suffered further consequences of rejecting the advice of Iranian censors who in 2003 encouraged him to leave .\n\u201c No Bears \u201d therefore stands as not only a work of great artistry , but of great cinematic defiance , quietly tracing the myriad of personal and political threads of its own origin .\nIt \u2019 s a strange story about a man using technology to direct a movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Panahi \u2019 s decades-long journey as a filmmaker , the lengths he \u2019 s been forced to go to in order to simply retain the title of his profession .\nHe \u2019 s a dissident who should never have had to be one .\nGlobal audiences are incredibly lucky to witness the intimacies of his struggle .", "author": "Siddhant Adlakha", "url":

.\nAmericans are being slammed by a \u201c tripledemic \u201d this holiday season as three major respiratory illnesses\u2014COVID-19 , influenza , and respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) \u2014are spreading at indoor gatherings .\nHospitals are once more in danger of running out of beds , and the Biden administration has revived a program to mail out free at-home COVID-19 testing kits .\nIt seems that the United States has learned nothing from the early months of the pandemic when our healthcare system broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of profit-based medicine .\nTake the current shortage of antibiotics and other medications .\nAxios reported that \u201c Parents have been calling [ pharmacies and other health care providers ] , distraught over the trouble they \u2019 ve had securing everything from Children \u2019 s Tylenol to amoxicillin to Tamiflu.\n\u201d Hospitals are also running out of drugs .\nThe reason for this is that the pharmaceutical industry , which operates adjacent to the healthcare industry , functions on thin margins , producing just enough inventory based on projections in order to maximize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain unsold .\nBut when a crisis hits , the projected supply is outstripped by demand .\nAnother example is that of Ascension , a company most of us have never heard of but one that the New York Times described as \u201c one of the country \u2019 s largest health systems.\n\u201d Although it is technically a nonprofit company , Ascension operates like a for-profit corporation , cutting costs by cutting staff .\nThis has left existing staff overstretched and exhausted , leading to mass resignations of nurses and other medical staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the pandemic swamped hospitals with critically ill patients , their lean staffing went from a financial strength to a glaring weakness.\n\u201d Meanwhile , for those people lucky enough to have private or public health care coverage , out-of-pocket health costs have risen sharply .\nThe U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) released figures for 2021 showing that Americans spent an average of $ 12,914 per person for healthcare costs that were not covered by their plans .\nThis is equivalent to 18.3 percent of the national gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone agrees that our healthcare system is in dire need of an overhaul .\nBut rather than seeing it as a problem that needs solving simply and efficiently , the system has become a target for capitalist opportunism .\nThe technology industry , which has sold society the lie that it can innovate a solution to any problem , has tried and failed to solve health care .\nFor example , in 2018 Google decided to get in on the game , launching \u201c Google Health \u201d as a way of \u201c helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later , the company gave up .\nOliver Kharraz , a former physician and the founder of Zocdoc , another tech attempt at solving the health care crisis , wrote in an op-ed on Fast Company that health care \u201c is the problem of our generation , and if we don \u2019 t fix it then it will break the bank , our health or both.\n\u201d Admitting that so far , technological approaches have not worked , Kharraz said , \u201c It is tempting to fix the symptoms , but ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Unfortunately , being invested in a private , for-profit mindset prevents Kharraz and others like him from seeing the situation in anything other than capitalist terms .\nBut there is a simple mathematical formula that appears to elude the world \u2019 s most brilliant minds : Taxpayer funding minus health care costs equals a net positive remainder .\nRecast as a word problem , this means that people pool their money together so that their representatives spend it on their health and well-being .\nAfter all , this same formula is applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , such as warfighting\u2014known more commonly by the term \u201c national defense.\n\u201d Each year Congress appropriates more and more taxpayer money toward military spending , and this year was no exception .\nLawmakers in mid-December approved a whopping $ 858 billion military spending bill\u2014an 8 percent increase over the previous year .\nIt is a mind-bogglingly large figure\u2014close to a trillion dollars .\nConservative politicians ( whether Democrat or Republican ) roll out endless objections to government funding of health care and squabble over the Affordable Care Act , single-payer health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut they manage to set aside their differences when it comes to applying the same idea of taxpayer funding to military spending .\nThis is not surprising .\nConservatism is aligned with national and personal self-interest .\nGovernment spending on the Pentagon ensures American military supremacy .\nBut government spending on health care means spreading the wealth among people based on collective concern for public health .\nIt turns out that conservative politics\u2014based on individualism and selfishness\u2014is bad for everyone \u2019 s health .\nA Harvard study examining the correlation between lawmakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates of their constituencies came to a stark conclusion .\nThe Washington Post summarized the results : the rates of death from COVID-19 \u201c were 11 percent higher in states with Republican-controlled governments and 26 percent higher in areas where voters lean conservative.\n\u201d What this means is that state-level policies that strip funding from welfare and social programs , in combination with behavior influenced by conservative politicians such as forgoing masks and vaccines , can result in poor health outcomes .\nOffering a contrast is the United Kingdom \u2019 s national health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK National Health Service ( NHS ) , flawed as it is , was able to enact broad , protective measures during the COVID-19 pandemic that saved lives .\nMeanwhile , in the U.S. , a sprawling and fractured profit-driven system in combination with myriad local public agencies was unable to agree on which measures to adopt .\nOne American infectious disease expert , William A. Haseltine , explained in the Hill in 2021 that given the U.S. healthcare system \u2019 s lack of \u201c federal authority to enact nationwide policy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense political polarization , as we are witnessing today , leaves public health matters divided across party lines rather than scientific consensus.\n\u201d The good news is that there is a public appetite for adopting the simple equation of using taxpayer funds to cover health care\u2014as long as the idea is not labeled as progressive .\nThe Intercept reported that voters enthusiastically passed a slew of progressive-leaning healthcare initiatives across the country during the November 2022 midterm elections .\nAs the Intercept noted , the example of Dunn County , Wisconsin , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language commonly associated with progressive Democrats such as \u201c single payer \u201d or \u201c Medicare for all.\n\u201d Instead , the ballot measure asked voters a very simple question : \u201c Shall Congress and the President of the United States enact into law the creation of a publicly financed , non-profit , national health insurance program that would fully cover medical care costs for all Americans ?\n\u201d A majority agreed with this idea .\nAlthough the measure was a symbolic one , the fact that voters from a rural Midwestern county support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care is a positive sign .\nThe existing corporate model of treating our healthcare needs purely through the lens of supply and demand , profit and loss , is utterly broken .\nWe don \u2019 t need any more examples of crisis-related breaking points .\nAnd we certainly don \u2019 t need tech bros agonizing over complex ways to exploitatively extract profits from our need to see a doctor .\nThere is a simpler , easier way to fix this mess .\nAuthor Bio : Sonali Kolhatkar is an award-winning multimedia journalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and executive producer of \u201c Rising Up With Sonali , \u201d a weekly television and radio show that airs on Free Speech TV and Pacifica stations .\nHer forthcoming book is Rising Up : The Power of Narrative in Pursuing Racial Justice ( City Lights Books , 2023 ) .\nShe is a writing fellow for the Economy for All project at the Independent Media Institute and the racial justice and civil liberties editor at Yes !\nMagazine .\nShe serves as the co-director of the nonprofit solidarity organization the Afghan Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bleeding Afghanistan .\nShe also sits on the board of directors of Justice Action Center , an immigrant rights organization .", "author": "Sonali Kolhatkar /  IMI", "url": "https://www.truthdig.com/articles/fixing-the-broken-american-healthcare-system-is-not-actually-hard/", "published": "Fri, 30 Dec 2022 21:24:24 +0000", "published_utc": 1672453464, "collection_utc": 1672444960}, {"id": "truthdig--2022-12-31--Happy New Year!", "date": "2022-12-31", "source": "truthdig", "title": "Happy New Year!", "content": "As we head into 2023 , we are thrilled to have relaunched Truthdig and its mission to drill beneath the @ @ @ @ @ media won \u2019 t .\nWhile the challenges we face \u2014 to our democratic institutions @ @ @ @ @ , in working toward equity and justice \u2014 remain as daunting as ever , we @ @ @ @ @ fear , defend our principles without compromise and think through needed solutions with imagination .\n@ @ @ @ @ support in making Truthdig a powerful beacon of independent journalism for the new year and @ @ @ @ @", "author": "Staff", "url": "https://www.truthdig.com/articles/truthdig-the-movie-happy-new-year/", "published": "Sat, 31 Dec 2022 20:03:40 +0000", "published_utc": 1672535020, "collection_utc": 1672531420}]
