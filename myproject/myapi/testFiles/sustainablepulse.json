national GMO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it \u2013 and has been criticised by both leading scientists and rural organisations .\nBut despite the criticism and the risk of potential contamination of cereal

Exchange , which stands at 34.4 quintals per hectare .\nIn May 2013 , as Canal Abierto reports , the company Bioceres obtained a license for the use and exploitation of the HB4 gene , a biotechnological event developed by Argentine state scientists in which the plant genome is manipulated by inserting a sunflower gene that increases resistance to drought and provides tolerance to the

, a herbicide restricted since 2013 in the European Union due to the harmful consequences it has on health , as its use leaves enough traces on the land and in food to cause damage to the human

into account that drought tolerance is only a smokescreen .\nIn reality HB4 wheat also expresses the gene that gives it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ or addition ] to the agrotoxin glyphosate .\nThis is particularly serious because wheat is an essential food that is part of the daily diet in our society , and with tolerance to glufosinate ( even without considering the genetic alteration ) , a

they believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three such cases have already been decided in favour of the plaintiffs .\nStudy lead Dr Michael Antoniou of King \u2019 s College London said , \u201c The new data showing changes in miRNA patterns add yet more evidence to the cancer-causing potential of glyphosate and Roundup .\nWhat is more , our results show that it is not just Roundup , which is a mixture of glyphosate with various additives , that has carcinogenic potential , but also glyphosate alone.\n\u201d The new data confirm and build on previously reported findings that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2021 , which GMWatch reported on .\nThe study with the additional findings has now passed peer review and is published in the prestigious journal , Toxicological Sciences .\nThe pre-print version of the study had reported that glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides such as Roundup activate mechanisms involved in cancer development , including DNA damage \u2013 and these effects occur at doses assumed by regulators to have no adverse effects .\nThe data suggest that the DNA damage was caused by oxidative stress , a destructive imbalance in the body that can cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress is the likely cause of the damage seen to the liver , leading to an inflammatory ( immune type ) response , which in turn can cause DNA damage .\nCrucially , the study found that the isolated active ingredient of Roundup \u2013 glyphosate \u2013 damaged DNA .\nThis finding , according to the EU \u2019 s pesticide law , should result in a ban on glyphosate and all its formulations .\nAll these findings are carried over into the peer-reviewed version of the study .\nHow the study was done The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous one by the same authors .\nIn the previous study , the researchers had compared the effects in rats of MON 52276 with those of its \u201c active ingredient \u201d , glyphosate , tested alone .\nThe findings showed that glyphosate and Roundup herbicide , given at doses that regulators say are safe , resulted in the animals suffering gut microbiome disturbances and oxidative stress , with indications that the liver was affected and possibly damaged .\nIn the current followup study , the researchers analysed the liver tissue from the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred .\nThe researchers carried out some of the standard tests that regulators require the pesticide industry to conduct to gain market authorisation for their products \u2013 namely blood biochemistry and kidney and liver histopathology ( microscopic examination of tissue ) .\nThey also carried out in-depth tests ( molecular profiling ) that are not demanded by regulators or typically carried out by the industry .\nOne type of test looked for adverse effects at a profound molecular level of biological functioning through analysis of gene expression ( transcriptomics ) and epigenetics ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidneys .\nAnother type of test , using specialised genetically engineered cell lines , was intended to highlight changes in function linked with cancer formation .\nIn addition , the researchers carried out tests that can detect direct damage to DNA .\nThe standard tests , histopathology and blood biochemistry analysis , found adverse effects from the Roundup treatment , namely a dose-dependent and statistically significant increase in fatty liver disease and liver cell death .\nThe finding of fatty liver disease from exposure to the MON 52276 formulation of Roundup confirmed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultra-low dose of another Roundup formulation , Roundup Grand Travaux Plus , administered to the same strain of Sprague-Dawley rats over a 2-year period , caused non-alcoholic fatty liver disease .\nAn increase in liver and kidney lesions was also detected in animals treated with glyphosate , although this did not reach statistical significance .\nHowever , the authors commented that an experiment of longer duration using more animals may have resulted in statistical significance .\nWorryingly for public health , it was the non-standard molecular profiling tests that are not required by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , Roundup was found to alter the expression of 96 genes in the liver specifically linked to DNA damage and oxidative stress , as well as disruption of circadian rhythms or \u201c body clocks \u201d .\nThe most affected genes in liver also had their expression similarly altered in kidneys .\nCrucially , a core set of genes whose expression was altered by Roundup was similarly changed in the glyphosate-treated animals .\nThis strongly suggests that the key changes in gene function reflective of oxidative stress and DNA damage was due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjuvants ) present in the Roundup formulation .\nSecond , direct DNA damage to the liver was found to increase with glyphosate exposure .\nThese findings potentially constitute a bombshell that could end the authorisation of glyphosate in the EU .\nThat \u2019 s because the EU pesticide regulation ( 1107/2009 ) has what \u2019 s known as hazard-based cut-off criteria .\nThis means that if a pesticide active ingredient is shown to cause a certain type of harm to health at whatever dose , it must be banned .\nOne of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DNA .\nThe discovery that glyphosate alone damages DNA in a living animal should , if regulators follow the law , result in a ban on the chemical .\nThird , both glyphosate and Roundup were found to cause epigenetic changes known as DNA methylation .\nEpigenetics describes layers of molecular structures associated with DNA that control the underlying function of genes .\nThe defining feature of epigenetic changes is that they can alter how genes work but do not involve changes to the actual DNA sequence .\nThese types of changes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glyphosate and over 4,000 for Roundup .\nThis is a concern because such alterations are typically found at high frequency in cancer tissues .\nAll findings lead to same conclusion The researchers performed further laboratory tests in mouse cell lines , which are designed to highlight effects that can lead to cancer formation .\nGlyphosate and three Roundup formulations were assessed in these tester cell lines .\nIt was found that two formulations of Roundup herbicide , but not glyphosate , activated oxidative stress and misfolded protein responses , both clear markers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the data , Dr Antoniou said , \u201c No matter what molecular measurements we undertook , they all led to the same conclusion : that is , both glyphosate and Roundup are potential carcinogens.\n\u201d Other studies , including the industry ones submitted to support regulatory approval of glyphosate , have also found that glyphosate causes cancer in experimental animals .\nBased on studies in animals and humans , as well as mechanistic data , in 2015 the International Agency for Research on Cancer ( IARC ) classified glyphosate as a probable human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study 1 .\nEnding animal testing is not yet feasible Interestingly , in the new study , glyphosate was shown to damage DNA in living animals but not in the cell culture system .\nThis shows that in vitro lab tests using isolated cells can not

a flask , petri dish , or test tube .\nWhile many people ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end to animal testing , as long as pesticides and other chemicals are allowed to be released into the environment , such a move would put public health at risk .\n2 .\nRoundup is more toxic than glyphosate In summary , in general Roundup was found to be more toxic than glyphosate , confirming and building on previous observations .\nHowever , taken together , the results from the various assays conducted show that both glyphosate and Roundup herbicides activate mechanisms involved in cancer development , causing gene expression changes reflecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glyphosate alone was clearly able to induce DNA damage .\nThese findings directly challenge the global regulatory practice of only assessing the isolated declared active ingredient ( glyphosate ) and not the complete commercial formulations ( Roundup ) as sold and used .\nThe study further highlights the power of in-depth molecular profiling \u201c omics \u201d methods to detect changes that are missed by relying solely on conventional biochemical and histopathological measurements conducted in standardised industry tests on pesticide active ingredients .\nThe study paves the way for future investigations by identifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites , which can serve as biomarkers and potential predictors of negative health outcomes resulting from exposure to glyphosate-based herbicides .\n3 .\nResults could allow survey of human population for glyphosate herbicide exposure Commenting on the implications of the results for human exposure monitoring , study lead Dr Michael Antoniou said , \u201c The biomarkers we identified ( such as the miRNA and gene expression changes ) can be tested for in people , but we don \u2019 t know if this particular pattern of biomarkers is unique to glyphosate-based herbicide exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be correlated with a history of exposure to glyphosate-based herbicides and measurements of glyphosate in urine .\n\u201c If high levels of glyphosate were found in the urine , and this correlated with the biomarkers identified in the new study and the person \u2019 s history of glyphosate herbicide exposure , this would indicate that exposure to glyphosate-based herbicides might be responsible for any health effects that are both indicated by our findings and found in the person .\nThese findings should be tested first by investigations of herbicide applicators , as their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the particular herbicides used are often recorded , which would enable clearer results to be obtained.\n\u201d 4 .\n\u201c Safe \u201d and \u201c no effect \u201d doses were shown to be harmful In the 90-day rat feeding study , different groups of animals were fed three different doses of glyphosate and the glyphosate-equivalent dose of Roundup MON 52276 .\nThe lowest dose was the concentration that regulators assume to be safe to ingest on a daily basis over a lifetime ( the EU acceptable daily intake or ADI : 0.5 mg per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The middle dose was the dose that EU regulators concluded had no observable adverse effect ( the \u201c no observable adverse effect \u201d level or NOAEL ) in industry-sponsored rat feeding studies ( 50 mg per kg of bodyweight per day ) .\nThe highest dose was 175 mg , the dose that US regulators concluded had no observable adverse effect .\nAdverse effects were found from Roundup exposure at all dose levels in a dose-dependent fashion .\nThese findings show that the glyphosate ADI for the EU \u2013 and that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not safe to ingest .\nLikewise , it shows that the EU and US regulators were only able to conclude that glyphosate had \u201c no observable adverse effect \u201d at the levels mentioned above because the tests that they require industry to carry out are insufficiently sensitive .\nSummarising the implications of the study for the Roundup-cancer litigation in the US , Dr Antoniou said , \u201c Our results are the first to simultaneously show glyphosate and Roundup toxicity in a whole mammalian animal model system and provide a mechanism \u2013 oxidative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been observed in other systems , such as mammalian tissue culture cells .\n\u201c These findings show that glyphosate and Roundup score positive in various tests of carcinogenicity \u2013 transcriptome/epigenome/miRNA changes , oxidative stress , protein misfolding , and DNA damage \u2013 in a living animal ( rat ) that is accepted as a surrogate for human health effects .\nIn my view , this strengthens the argument that exposure to Roundup herbicides can lead to the type of cancer suffered by the plaintiffs in many of the court cases \u2013 non-Hodgkin lymphoma @ @", "author": "Sustainable Pulse",

@ @ Not only is it near-impossible to monitor such a vast number , but as many as 80 % of insects may not have been discovered yet \u2013 of which many are tropical species .\nResponding to these knowledge gaps , researchers at UCL \u2019 s Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research have conducted one of the largest-ever assessments of insect biodiversity change .\nSome three-quarters of a million samples from around 6,000 sites worldwide were analysed in our study , adding up to nearly 20,000 different species in all .\nInsects are facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twin horsemen \u201d of climate change and habitat loss .\nWe sought to understand how insect biodiversity is being affected in areas that experience both these challenges most severely .\nWe know they do not work in isolation : habitat loss can add to the effects of climate change by limiting available shade , for example , leading to even warmer temperatures in these vulnerable areas .\nFor the first time , we were able to include these important interactions in our global biodiversity modelling .\nOur findings , published in Nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmland areas within tropical countries \u2013 where the combined effects of climate change and habitat loss are experienced most profoundly .\nWe compared high-intensity farmland sites where high levels of warming have occurred with ( related ) areas of natural habitat that are little-affected by climate change .\nThe farmland sites possess only half the number of insects , on average , and more than 25 % fewer insect species .\nThroughout the world , our analysis also shows that farmland in climate-stressed areas where most nearby natural habitat has been removed has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on average , compared with as little as 7 % for farmland where the nearby natural habitat has been largely preserved .\nAreas our study highlights as particularly at risk include Indonesia and Brazil , where many crops depend on insects for pollination and other vital ecosystem services .\nThis has serious implications for local farmers and the wider food chain in these climatically and economically vulnerable areas .\nEighty-seven of the world \u2019 s major crops are thought to be fully or partially dependent on insect pollinators , of which most tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cocoa , for example , is primarily pollinated by midges , a group of flies infamous for bedevilling camping trips in Scotland and other parts of the northern hemisphere .\nIn fact , midges play a vital and under-appreciated role in pollinating the cocoa needed to make chocolate .\nThe majority of cocoa production takes place in Indonesia , C\u00f4te d \u2019 Ivoire and Ghana .\nIn Indonesia alone , the export of cocoa beans is valued at around US $ 75 million per year .\nMost cocoa production is carried out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many farmers are dependent on this crop for their livelihoods .\nWhile it is critical to understand whether insect losses will make things worse for cocoa and its farmers , we have very little knowledge of the state of insect biodiversity in tropical countries such as Indonesia .\nCocoa production in the region is already being stressed by adverse weather events that may be linked to climate change .\nWarming temperatures and changing rainfall patterns are implicated in changes in the growth , pollination and bean production of cocoa plants .\nAgriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of Indonesia , particularly in rural regions , with large areas being cleared for the production of key crops , also including palm oil .\nThis has resulted in deforestation of extensive areas of rainforest , increasing the risk to many rare and endangered species such as the orangutan , as well as less well-known species including many insects .\nTropical regions are under considerable threat , primarily as a result of agricultural expansion \u2013 often to meet increasing demand from countries outside the tropics .\nInternational trade has been shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these regions , with forests in Southeast Asia , East and West Africa and the Amazon particularly vulnerable .\nBrazil \u2019 s and Indonesia \u2019 s high levels of deforestation are attributed to the production of commodities for export including soybean , coffee , palm oil \u2013 and cocoa .\nHabitat loss is known to be a key threat to biodiversity , yet its impact on insects is still under-studied , and assessments of tropical species tend to be very rare .\nOne study found that forest-dependent orchid bees in Brazil have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( although it only sampled their numbers at two time points ) .\nOrchid bees , found only in the Americas , are important pollinators of orchid flowers , with some plants being entirely dependent on this insect for their pollination .\nAdding to the challenges of deforestation and other , longer-term habitat changes , is climate change .\nThis fast-emerging threat to insect biodiversity has already been implicated in declines of moths in Costa Rica and bumblebees in Europe and North America .\nRising temperatures and increasing frequency of extreme weather events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two manifestations known to be having a harmful impact on many insect species .\nIt is predicted that climate change will have a particularly big impact in the planet \u2019 s tropical regions .\nTemperatures in the tropics are naturally quite stable , so species aren \u2019 t used to coping with the fast changes in temperature we are seeing with climate change .\nAgain , though , our ability to understand how this is affecting tropical insects is hampered by a lack of data for these regions .\nAlmost all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well-studied groups of insects \u2013 in particular , butterflies , moths and bees \u2013 while many other groups receive very little attention .\nDespite a big increase in studies of insect biodiversity change , there is still much we don \u2019 t know .\nTo help address this knowledge gap , our study has assessed three-quarters of a million samples of insects from all over the world .\nOf the 6,000 sites included , almost one third are from tropical locations .\nOur samples of nearly 20,000 different insect species include beetles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butterflies , moths , flies , bugs , dragonflies and other , less well-known groups .\nThis was made possible through the use of PREDICTS , a biodiversity database which brings together millions of samples collected by researchers all over the world .\nPREDICTS records biodiversity in natural habitats and also in areas used by humans for growing crops , among other purposes .\nIt is one of very few global databases that allow us to study biodiversity changes across the whole world .\nWhile our 20,000-strong sample represents only a fraction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is still a sample from more sites than have ever been studied before .\nWe were particularly interested in using it to understand how habitat loss and climate change play off each other to affect insect biodiversity , and were able to include these interactions in our models for the first time .\nThese twin conditions are found most profoundly in farmland in tropical countries .\nAnd our results demonstrate that farmland in these regions has typically lost a lot of insect biodiversity , relative to areas of primary vegetation .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major threat to food security not only by directly impacting crops , but also through losses of pollinators and other important insects .\nAs climate change accelerates , the ability to grow cocoa and other crops in their current geographical ranges is already becoming more uncertain , threatening local livelihoods and reducing the availability of these crops for consumers all over the world .\nThe insect losses our study highlights are only likely to add to this risk .\nIndeed , threats to food security due to the loss of insect biodiversity are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tropical regions : for example , evidence of reduced yields due to a lack of pollinators has been reported for cherry , apple and blueberry production in the US .\nIn some parts of the world , farmers are resorting to hand-pollination techniques , where the flowers of crops are pollinated using a brush .\nHand pollination is used for cocoa in a number of countries , including Ghana and Indonesia .\nThese techniques can help to maintain or increase yield , but come at a high labour cost .\nOur study also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insect declines .\nLowering the intensity of farming \u2013 for example , by using fewer chemicals and having a greater diversity of crops \u2013 mitigates some of the negative effects of habitat loss and climate change .\nIn particular , we show that preserving natural habitat within farmed landscapes really helps insects .\nWhere farmland in climate-stressed areas with its natural habitat largely removed shows insect reductions of 63 % , on average , this number drops to as little as 7 % where three-quarters of the nearby natural habitat has been preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural habitat patches act as an alternative source of food , nesting sites and places to shelter from high temperatures .\nThis offers hope that even while the planet continues to warm , there are options that will reduce some of the impacts on insect biodiversity .\nIndeed , natural habitat availability has already been shown , at smaller scales , to have a positive impact within agricultural systems in particular .\nFor Indonesian cocoa , increasing the amount of natural habitat has been found to boost numbers of key insects including pollinators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the benefits of this intervention are only found in less-intensive farming systems .\nThis might mean reducing the level of inputs such as fertilisers and insecticides that are applied , or increasing crop diversity to ensure the benefits of nearby natural habitat can be felt .\nIt \u2019 s also important to note that not all species are enduring a hard time as a result of recent pressures .\nFor example , recent work looking at UK insects has shown that while some groups have declined , others , including freshwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnother study looking at worldwide insect trends also found increases in the numbers of freshwater insects .\nHowever , many of these positive trends have been reported in non-tropical regions such as the UK and Europe , where a lot has been done , for example , to improve the water quality of rivers in recent years , following past degradation .\nThe COVID-19 lockdowns prompted many of us to reconnect with the flora and fauna around us .\nIn the UK , the warm spring weather of 2020 saw an apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK countryside .\nHowever , this spike was probably temporary , and something of an anomaly set against the bigger picture worldwide .\nTo support more insect biodiversity in our local environments , we can plant diverse gardens to attract insects , reduce the amount of pesticides used in gardens and allotments , and reduce how often we mow our lawns .\n( In the UK , you could consider joining the No Mow May challenge . )\nHowever , it is not just locally that we can make a difference .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ could help protect insects and other creatures in the tropics .\nFor example , buying shade-grown coffee or cocoa will ensure a lesser impact on biodiversity than crops grown in the open .\nMeanwhile , governments and other public and private organisations should consider more carefully the impact their actions and policies are having on insects .\nThis could range from the proper consideration of biodiversity within trade policies and agreements , to ensuring that products are not sourced from areas associated with high deforestation rates .\nAnd then there \u2019 s the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance of insects for human health and wellbeing , and their key role in global food production systems .\nSafeguarding the environment to protect insects into the future will have big benefits for human societies around the world .\nHowever , none of this is possible without good data .\nOne important step towards a better understanding of insect biodiversity change is to bring together and assess the data that is already available .\nA new project of which we are part , GLiTRS ( GLobal Insect Threat-Response Synthesis ) , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading experts from a range of institutions and ecological disciplines , including data analysts .\nThe project will then assess how different insect groups are responding to certain threats .\nUnderstanding what is causing insect declines is key for preventing even greater losses in the future , and for safeguarding the valuable functions that insects perform .\nClimate change and biodiversity loss are major global crises that are two sides of the same coin .\nTheir combined effects on food production mean the health , wellbeing and livelihoods of many people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance .\nInsect biodiversity losses are a crucial , but as yet understudied , part of this story .", "author": "Sustainable Pulse", "url":

AG , advising the U.S. Supreme Court that it should deny the company \u2019 s request for a review of a key Roundup cancer trial loss , Carey Gillam on UnSpun reported .\nBayer has seen the Supreme Court as its last and best hope for putting a stop to the flood of lawsuits filed by tens of thousands of people claiming exposure to Roundup weed killing products caused them to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) .\nThe brief from Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Court to grant review\u2026 \u201d Bayer , which bought Monsanto in 2018 , filed its petition to the high court in August , asking the court to review the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \u2019 decision that affirmed the district court \u2019 s judgment in Monsanto \u2019 s 2019 trial loss to plaintiff Edwin Hardeman .\nThe jury in the case agreed with Hardeman \u2019 s attorneys that exposure to Monsanto \u2019 s glyphosate-based herbicide was a cause of Hardeman \u2019 s NHL and that Monsanto failed to warn of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the herbicide and cancer .\nHardeman was awarded approximately $ 80 million by the jury , but the award was cut by the trial court judge to roughly $ 25.2 million .\nBayer did pay Hardeman as it awaited word from the U.S. Supreme Court , but accompanied the funds with a letter warning him that he may have to repay the money if the company was successful in getting a reversal by the U.S. Supreme Court .\nBayer maintains Monsanto \u2019 s glyphosate herbicides do not cause cancer , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fungicide , and Rodenticide Act ( FIFRA ) , which governs the registration , distribution , sale , and use of pesticides in the United States , preempts \u201c failure-to-warn \u201d claims by Hardeman and other plaintiffs in the Roundup litigation .\nBecause the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has approved labels with no cancer warning , failure-to-warn claims should be barred , the company maintains .\nIn addition to the FIFRA issue , the company urged the Supreme Court to also address whether or not the Ninth Circuit \u2019 s standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d with precedent and federal evidence rules .\nBayer argues that the admission of expert testimony in the Hardeman case \u201c departed from federal standards , enabling plaintiff \u2019 s causation witnesses to provide unsupported testimony on the principal issue in the case , Roundup \u2019 s safety profile.\n\u201d The Solicitor General \u2019 s brief states that \u201c FIFRA does not preempt respondent \u2019 s claims \u201d and found that the evidentiary

Aimee Wagstaff and Jennifer Moore said in the statement .\n\u201c Despite paying billions of dollars to other Roundup plaintiffs , Monsanto has refused to resolve Mr. Hardeman \u2019 s case .\nInstead

Affairs ( Defra ) , following a Freedom of Information ( FOI ) request by Beyond GM , highlight the extent to which Defra is ignoring and seeking to misrepresent citizens and civil society organisations in the push to deregulate genetic engineering technologies .\nIn January 2021 Defra undertook a Public Consultation on The Regulation of Genetic Technologies .\nThe concerns of expert groups at bthe time were that the consultation was inadequate and biased , but also broke Cabinet Office Principles on consultations .\nThese concerns intensified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consultation revealed that the Department had removed more than half ( 52 % ) of all the responses received from its official analysis on the basis that they were linked to campaign organisations .\nEven with this outrageous culling of responses , overall 85 % of responses to the consultation expressed a desire to see crops , animal and food products produced using gene editing regulated in the same way as other GMOs .\nThis majority view was ignored by Defra and the government , which chose to focus instead on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vested interests that supported their deregulation agenda .\nNo \u201c right to know \u201d how policy is made The original FOI request , which focused on the process around the Defra public consultation and the government \u2019 s deregulation agenda , was quite broad and several requests were denied on the grounds that : \u201c Release of the information requested would risk inhibiting officials and Ministers from having full , frank and open discussions as part of the process of formulating policy , particularly if they felt that speculative information relating to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions were made on those issues.\n\u201d The cache of FOI documents received by Beyond GM includes official emails and documents such as training slides , as well as the existence of an internal Defra process described as \u2018 coding \u2019 , in which written responses received during the consultation are analysed by Defra personnel , and in some case specially recruited staff , to determine how some responses could be downgraded or removed from the final analysis and Consultation report .\nBy now Beyond GM stated that they would have expected Defra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as of today \u2019 s date , it has yet to publish these FOI releases , and has not responded to a request for them to be published , even though it has a duty to do so .\nBeyond GM is therefore making them public .\nIn working their way through a large and interesting stack of documents , Beyond GM found that it is clear that : \u2022 Defra made extensive efforts around the coding of responses from citizens in order to put as many of these responses as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response \u201d and remove them from the official analysis .\n\u2022 Defra appeared to rely heavily on inexperienced and/or \u2018 temp \u2019 staff to perform the analysis .\nCoding can be constructively used in consultation analysis to identify and classify common themes across wide-ranging consultations .\nBut using it to group responses into a \u2018 campaign \u2019 classification and mark these for removal from the final analysis is , in our view , an unacceptable manipulation of the consultation process .\nEven if a response has been written and sent by an individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research of such resources \u2013 that response was effectively \u2018 downgraded \u2019 , having been coded as part of a campaign for using similar words or phrases .\nIn Beyond GM \u2019 s communication with Defra they were told that removing campaign responses is common .\nThis may be so .\nIndeed , there are recommendations in this FOI cache to \u201c share the NFS [ National Food Strategy ] work as an example for managing campaign responses \u201d .\nIt is notable that while pro-GM groups often repeat and copy each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOI documents does Defra discuss how to handle \u2018 stock \u2019 or campaign responses linked to such groups .\nOnly those that raised questions and objections to deregulation were \u2018 coded \u2019 out of the analysis .\nThis included responses that used material , or could be linked to the material , from : \u2022 RSPCA ( Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Making it up as they go along Whatever justification might be claimed for this exclusion process is undermined by the haphazard , making-it-up-as-they-go along approach revealed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One Defra communication released as part of the FOI request says \u201d \u201c Hi all , Just a quick reminder to follow on from my e-mail below to familiarise yourselves with the campaign responses , especially the Beyond GM one , as that is coming up a lot ( sometimes verbatim , sometime adapted ) so that you can spot the wording\u2026 ) \u201d .\n\u2022 Another later in the coding process shows Defra went over and over the responses to remove campaign responses : \u201c Could we also run the clustering again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We managed to get 4 campaigns from the clusters ( one campaign was split across two clusters ) so definitely useful\u2026 \u201d \u2022 Another looking at a \u201c theory campaign \u201d \u2013 that is , a response Defra thinks is from a campaign \u2013 says : \u201c This is definitely not a perfect process .\nFor example on the \u2018 theory campaign \u2019 you \u2019 ll note that this pesky sentence ( \u201c organisms developed using genetic technologies such as gene editing should continue to be regulated as GMOs even if their genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 have been produced through traditional breeding \u201d ) still comes out as unique , probably because of the hyphens.\n\u201d \u2022 Another document notes ongoing efforts to classify multiple individual responses as being organised via a campaign , stating : \u201c I think , in the main , the unique sentences will actually still be standardised just tweaked slightly so they weren \u2019 t detected .\nIn these instances I would still consider this a campaign response.\n\u201d \u2022 Elsewhere in the cache Defra suggests that where individuals adapted campaign responses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberate ploy to avoid detection : \u201c This just goes to show how subtle these campaigns are !\n\u201d \u2022 In another email seen by Beyond GM , because two responses already decided to be from two separate campaigns use the same wording , an official has decided , \u201c Therefore I think we should lump them together and reflect that [ in ] the consultation , otherwise I think we \u2019 d be giving undue attention to [ B ] eyond GM.\n\u201d The cache also makes clear that where there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as campaigns : \u201c I had tagged a couple as \u2018 non campaign \u2019 but these are the ones that you flagged as being very customised , I \u2019 m happy to keep them as a campaign as they are largely based on them.\n\u201d One document gave some clue to the attitudes that underpin this approach : \u201c It is important to keep in mind that public consultations are not necessarily representative of the wider population .\nSince anyone can submit their views , individuals and organisations who are more able and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate.\n\u201d The Defra public consultation was highly technical and difficult to negotiate and one of civil society \u2019 s important roles is acting as a bridge between citizens and the government and helping citizens to negotiate the often difficult terrain of government processes .\nIf the process of public consultation is to have any shred of legitimacy it must be accompanied by transparency , even-handedness and clear , published criteria .\nBut at no point did Defra warn citizens that their view would be discounted if they used or even rephrased information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves through the steps of delivering on the government \u2019 s deregulation agenda , it is worth considering the toxic legacy it has inherited with regard to civil society and citizens .\nOwen Paterson , Defra Secretary in 2015 , called civil society a \u2018 green blob \u2019 .\nIn so doing he demonstrated a complete lack of understanding of the function of civil society and the differences between individual NGOs .\nGeorge Eustice \u2019 s comments at last year \u2019 s Oxford Farming conference equating civil society with lobby groups showed little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be laid before Parliament recently deals with an important and powerful technology that invokes very mixed responses amongst people .\nThese differences should not be swept under the carpet or be subjected to attempts to manipulate them out of existence .\nGenetic engineering technologies require regulation that is responsive to public concerns and interests , that is transparent , and that engages citizens in a respectful manner that can be trusted .\nIn the UK they are still a long way from that goal .", "author": "Sustainable Pulse", "url": "https://sustainablepulse.com/2022/06/01/uk-government-documents-reveal-disregard-for-public-views-on-gene-edited-crops/", "published":

Causes Fatal Damage to Bumblebee Colonies", "content": "Bumblebee colonies exposed to low levels of the weed killer glyphosate are unable to adequately regulate nest temperature , imperiling the next generation of bumblebees and long-term colony growth and survival .\nThis latest finding , published this month in the journal Science , is a stark reminder that a pesticide does not have to kill an animal outright in order to create effects that ultimately result in death and population declines , Beyond Pesticides reported Wednesday .\n\u201c Sublethal effects , i.e .\neffects on organisms that are not lethal but can be seen , for example , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have a significant negative impact and should be taken into account when pesticides are approved in future , \u201d said Anja Weidenm\u00fcller , PhD , of the University of Konstanz , Germany .\nWith regulators at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) refusing to adequately account for sublethal impacts , and myopically focused on the acute effects of pesticide exposure , bumblebee populations in the United States are in free fall and require urgent protective action .\nTo better understand how glyphosate exposure affects bumblebee colony growth and brood ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first split colonies in two .\nOne side of the colony was fed sugar water containing 5mg/liter of glyphosate , while the other side was fed pure , unadulterated sugar water .\nThis practice accounts for natural variation in strength that can occur between different bumblebee colonies .\nAlthough the colonies were separated by a mesh screen , each day the scientists switched the queens between the two sides .\nBees did not die from exposure to this level of glyphosate , living at least 32 days , a typical worker bumblebee life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did display slightly reduced investment in brood development , the most outsized effect of glyphosate exposure was on colony thermoregulation .\nBumblebee colonies require temperatures between 82.4\u00b0F and 95\u00b0F ( 28\u00b0C and 35\u00b0C ) in order for eggs and brood to properly develop .\n\u201c Just as we humans keep our body temperature constant , the animals in a colony collectively show homeostasis in the temperature regulation of their brood , \u201d says Dr. Weidenm\u00fcller .\nGlyphosate exposure alone did not impair thermoregulation , but when researchers dialed back on the sugar syrup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the unexposed control colony halves , the sides treated with glyphosate dropped below 82.4\u00b0F much more rapidly .\nIn sum , glyphosate-exposed sides maintained adequate brood conditions 26 % less time than the unexposed side of the colony .\nMost of the contaminated sides had no region in the nest that was above the 82.4\u00b0F mark , and thus viable for new eggs .\n\u201c When resources become scarce , you see very clearly that the collective thermal behaviour of colonies that have been chronically exposed to glyphosate is affected , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not keep their brood warm for as long.\n\u201d Impairing nest thermoregulation has major knock-on effects that place the colony in existential danger .\nEven temperatures at 77\u00b0F reduce brood development speed by 50 % of its potential maximum and give new eggs a success rate as low as 17 % .\n\u201c Bumblebee colonies are under really high pressure to grow as quickly as possible within a short period of time , \u201d says Dr. Weidenm\u00fcller .\n\u201c Only when they reach a certain colony size during the relatively short growth period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproductive individuals of a colony , i.e .\nqueens and drones.\n\u201d Further modeling of the study \u2019 s findings show that low temperatures are likely to further impair this process .\nOne of the most critical time in a colony \u2019 s development is after queen hibernation , when there is an urgent need to replenish their energy stores in order to start constructing a nest .\nBumblebee queens waking up in the cold , early spring to relatively low floral resources , and a contaminated landscape represents a slow moving disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the world .\nAs it stands currently , the American bumblebee has experienced an 89 % decline in its population over the last 20 years .\nThe rusty patched bumblebee has seen a similar 91 % decline since the 1990s and in 2017 was listed as endangered by the U.S .\nFish and Wildlife Service under the Endangered Species Act .\nGlyphosate is far from the only chemical stressor harming bumblebees .\nSystemic neonicotinoid insecticides represent an even more potent threat , posing both acute and chronic hazards to a range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that neonicotinoids pose a threat to bumblebees at every single step in their life stage .\nReinforcing the present study , research published in 2020 by researchers at University of California , Davis revealed that mason bees experiencing a combination of food scarcity and exposure to the neonicotinoid imidacloprid saw a 57 % reduction in offspring , compared to unexposed bees .\nIn addition to a wide range of chemical exposure , and the lack of floral resources from development and industrialized agriculture , are the effects of climate change .\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North American and European bumble bees are unable to colonize new warmer habitats

the Ninth Circuit sided with Center for Food Safety ( CFS ) and its represented farmworker and conservation clients by overturning the Environmental Protection Agency \u2019 s ( EPA ) decision that the toxic pesticide glyphosate is safe for humans and imperiled wildlife .\nGlyphosate is the active ingredient in Monsanto-Bayer \u2019 s flagship Roundup weedkiller , the most widely used pesticide in the world .\nThe 54-page opinion held the Trump administration \u2019 s 2020 interim registration of glyphosate to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider whether glyphosate causes cancer and shirked its duties under the Endangered Species Act ( ESA ) .\n\u201d Represented by Center for Food Safety , the petitioners in the lawsuit included the Rural Coalition , Farmworker Association of Florida , Organizaci\u00f3n en California de Lideres Campesinas , and Beyond Pesticides .\nA consolidated case is led by Natural Resources Defense Council and includes Pesticide Action Network .\n\u201c Today \u2019 s decision gives voice to those who suffer from glyphosate \u2019 s cancer , non-Hodgkin \u2019 s lymphoma , \u201d said Amy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Food Safety and lead counsel in the case .\n\u201c EPA \u2019 s \u2018 no cancer \u2019 risk conclusion did not stand up to scrutiny .\nToday is a major victory for farmworkers and others exposed to glyphosate .\nImperiled wildlife also won today , as the court agreed that EPA needed to ensure the safety of endangered species before greenlighting glyphosate.\n\u201d \u201c We welcome and applaud the court on this significant decision , \u201d said Jeannie Economos , Pesticide Safety and Environmental Health Project Coordinator at the Farmworker Association of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c While it comes too late for many farmworkers and landscapers who suffer after glyphosate exposure , we are grateful for the court \u2019 s ruling , and hope that now EPA will act quickly to protect future workers from illness and disease resulting from this toxic pesticide.\n\u201d As to its cancer conclusion , the court concluded that EPA flouted its own Cancer Guidelines and ignored the criticisms of its own experts .\nEPA \u2019 s \u201c not likely to cause cancer \u201d conclusion was inconsistent with the evidence before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies ( real-world cancer cases ) and lab animal studies .\nIn addition to its lack of conclusion as to non-Hodgkin \u2019 s lymphoma risk ( the cancer most tied to glyphosate ) , the court also concluded that EPA \u2019 s general \u201c no cancer \u201d decision was divorced from its own Guidelines and experts when EPA selectively discounted evidence that glyphosate causes tumors in animals .\nAt various points the Court criticized EPA \u2019 s \u201c disregard of tumor results ; \u201d its use of \u201c bare assertions \u201d that \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; \u201d making conclusions that do not \u201c withstand scrutiny under the agency \u2019 s own framework , \u201d and \u201c failing to abide by \u201d its cancer guidelines .\nIn sum the court noted EPA \u2019 s \u201c inconsistent reasoning \u201d made its decision on cancer \u201c arbitrary , \u201d and struck it down .\n\u201c We are grateful that the court decided in our favor , \u201d said John Zippert , chairperson of the Rural Coalition , a plaintiff in the case .\n\u201c We need to halt glyphosate \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who suffer the deepest consequences of exposure .\nThis decision will hopefully hasten the transition to farming and gardening methods and practices that increase resilience , protecting our children , our planet , and all those who feed us.\n\u201d \u201c EPA \u2019 s failure to act on the science , as detailed in the litigation , has real-world adverse health consequences for farmworkers , the public , and ecosystems , \u201d said Jay Feldman , executive director of Beyond Pesticides , a plaintiff in the case.\n\u201d Because of this lawsuit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulatory process will not be allowed to stand , and EPA should start shifting food production to available alternative non- and less-toxic practices and materials that meet its statutory duty.\n\u201d The court went on to conclude that EPA \u2019 s decision also violated the Endangered Species Act .\nAs the court noted , EPA itself elsewhere had admitted that \u201c glyphosate \u2018 may affect \u2019 all listed species experiencing glyphosate exposure\u2014that is 1,795 endangered or threatened species \u201d yet had unlawfully ignored the ESA for this decision .\nAs to remedy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human health assessment .\nThe court also required that EPA redo and/or finish all remaining glyphosate determinations by an October 2022 deadline , or within four months .\nThis includes a redone ecological toxicity assessment , a redone costs analysis of impacts to farmers from pesticide harms , as well as all Endangered Species analysis and mitigation .\nIn an \u201c interim registration review \u201d decision for glyphosate issued in January 2020 , EPA finalized its human health and ecological risk assessments and adopted \u201c mitigation measures \u201d in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no cancer risk from glyphosate , despite major gaps in its review , including coming to \u201c no conclusion \u201d as to non-Hodgkin lymphoma , the most well-known cancer linked to glyphosate .\nEPA also failed to do any assessment of how much glyphosate gets into a user \u2019 s bloodstream after skin contact , a major route of occupational exposure .\nCritically , EPA failed to test any of the glyphosate product formulations , which contain ingredients beyond just the active ingredient ( glyphosate ) and can increase the harmful effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EPA continued to the use of glyphosate with minor , unsubstantiated label changes , it needed to consider the impacts to imperiled species and do more to protect them from glyphosate .\nCFS and allies originally filed the lawsuit in 2020 , incorporating volumes of evidence showing how EPA ignored glyphosate \u2019 s health risks , including cancer risks , to farmworkers and farmers exposed during spraying .\nPetitioners also challenged EPA \u2019 s decision based on risks to the environment and imperiled species , such as the Monarch butterfly .\nIn response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in May 2021 EPA effectively admitted grave errors in its interim registration and asked the court for permission to re-do the agency \u2019 s faulty ecological , cost-benefit , and Endangered Species Act assessments .\nHowever , the agency stated that Roundup should nonetheless stay on the market in the interim\u2014without any deadline for a new decision .\nIn July 2021 , Bayer announced it will end the sales of its glyphosate-based herbicides ( including Roundup ) in the U.S. residential lawn and garden market in 2023 in order to \u201c manage litigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns.\n\u201d In California , jury trials continue to be held .\nLast year , courts affirmed a judgment against Monsanto for cancer from Roundup in Hardeman v. Monsanto\u2014one of the first in a series of high-profile consumer lawsuits filed against Monsanto-Bayer\u2014and in the third appeal of such a claim in Pilliod v. Monsanto .\nWhile EPA has repeatedly declared that glyphosate does not cause cancer , the world \u2019 s foremost cancer authorities with the World Health Organization declared glyphosate to be \u2018 probably carcinogenic to humans \u2018 in 2015 .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , EPA \u2019 s own Office of Research and Development concluded that glyphosate is either a likely carcinogen or at least there is evidence suggesting that it causes cancer , particularly increases the risk of NHL .", "author": "Sustainable Pulse", "url":

access to all relevant information to make an informed answer and call on you to publish this survey without delay.\n\u201d What has the Commission said publicly ?\nThe Commission has announced a new legal framework for plants obtained by \u201c targeted mutagenesis \u201d ( by which it seems to mean gene editing of the SDN-1 and SDN-2 types ) and cisgenesis ( genetic engineering in which genes are artificially transferred between organisms that could otherwise be conventionally bred ) .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a separate regulatory regime for these GM crops , excluding them from existing EU rules for GMOs .\nIt also wants to promote supposedly \u201c sustainable \u201d GM crops \u2013 those that it believes can contribute to the EU \u2019 s Green Deal objectives .\nSo far , little has been known about this new framework .\nThe Commission has only set out certain \u201c policy elements \u201d in a so-called Inception Impact Assessment , published in September 2021 : * Risk assessment and approval requirements \u201c proportionate to the risk involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appropriate traceability and labelling provisions \u201d * Mechanisms to be able to rapidly adjust elements of the legislation .\nThese \u201c policy elements \u201d are not further explained in the Commission \u2019 s public consultation , which closes on 22 July ( GMWatch has submitted its response ) .\nIn line with earlier announcements , the consultation talks about legislation for GM \u201c plants produced by targeted mutagenesis or cisgenesis \u201d .\nIt assumes , without evidence , and ignoring a large pile of evidence showing extensive DNA damage caused by gene editing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been produced through conventional plant breeding or classical mutagenesis \u201d ( questions 3 and 12 ) .\n\u201c Classical mutagenesis \u201d means the decades-old techniques of radiation- or chemical-induced mutagenesis breeding .\nThe Commission also assumes , again without evidence , that some such GM plants could have \u201c traits contributing to sustainability \u201d ( question 7 ) .\nThe Commission has always rejected the term \u201c deregulation \u201d .\nIt has said it is going to introduce an \u201c appropriate \u201d and fit-for-purpose regulatory framework for certain GM crops derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls \u201c new genomic techniques \u201d .\nIt has also said it will not compromise on consumer and environmental safety .\nHowever , the detailed policy scenarios show another picture \u2013 that full deregulation of some GM crops is a realistic option .\nWhat are the Commission \u2019 s plans ?\nThe Commission \u2019 s consultants targeted survey describes seven policy scenarios considered by the Commission \u2013 which are not mentioned in the public consultation .\nThese scenarios are important because they form the basis for the upcoming regulatory impact assessment , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and against a baseline scenario ( i.e .\nno policy action ) .\nThe seven policy scenarios , A1 to C2 , reveal that the Commission is considering scrapping all GMO regulatory requirements for GM crops that \u201c could also be obtained naturally or by conventional breeding \u201d .\nThe scenarios show that : * The Commission wants to distinguish two new categories of GM plants : GM crops that \u201c could also be obtained naturally or by conventional breeding \u201d and GM crops that have \u201c desirable sustainability impacts \u201d .\n* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be obtained naturally or by conventional breeding , the Commission is considering scrapping all GMO regulatory requirements ( scenarios A2 , B3 ) .\nThis includes the requirements for \u2013 pre-market safety assessment \u2013 product traceability across the supply chain \u2013 GMO detection method supplied by the developer of the GMO in question \u2013 GMO labelling .\nThese GM crops would essentially be regulated like non-GM crops , disregarding any risks to public health and the environment , the need of non-GM producers to rule out GM contamination , and the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their food .\nCommission scenarios A2 and B3 are exactly what Bayer has publicly asked for .\nIn its response to the Commission \u2019 s public consultation , Bayer said it wants a screening step in the regulation to decide whether any GMO regulatory steps at all are needed .\nBayer said there should be a \u201c first step\u2026 assessing whether the changes in the DNA\u2026 are similar to the ones that could have been obtained through conventional breeding

unnecessary toxics in their food by going organic with their food choices , planting their own pesticide-free gardens , and encouraging their elected officials to embrace safer , sustainable land care policies .\nThe FDA has conducted a review of pesticide residues on food on an annual basis since 1987 , evaluating both domestic and imported foodstuffs into the US market .\nWhile the EPA sets \u201c pesticide tolerances , \u201d also known as \u201c maximum residue levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain foods , the FDA ( and the USDA , for some specific items like meat , poultry , and eggs ) is tasked with enforcing these provisions .\nPesticide tolerances , from the start , imply that there is a tolerable level of pesticide exposure that can be applied to the general public .\nHowever , this process is rife with problems that have important public health implications .\nThe EPA sets tolerances as part of its \u201c food safety equation , \u201d conducting a dietary risk assessment to determine the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no harm \u201d under the Federal Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act .\nAs part of this process , the EPA is required by law to evaluate both dietary pesticide

it is taking into account consumption by more sensitive groups , in practice this is often not the case .\nRegulatory deficiencies place pregnant mothers , children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. at risk .\nPregnant mothers and their children take in more pesticide relative to adults and have developing organs systems less capable of detoxifying toxic chemicals ; as a result , they are at greater risk from lower amounts of pesticide exposure on food than adults .\nMany ethnic groups also consume much more of a given food than the EPA often estimates the average consumer would eat .\nThus , for

levels of consumption .\nSimilarly , not considered at elevated risk are those with preexisting conditions or with elevated exposures because they are living in fenceline communities ( near chemical

post-harvest human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ samples containing chlorpyrifos , which is now banned for use in agriculture .\nThirty-three samples contained glyphosate , which the FDA was previously cited for failing to test by the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) .\nProducts with the highest number of violations include basmati rice imported from India and Pakistan , green onions from Mexico , dragon fruit from Vietnam , and jackfruit from Mexico .\nOf these major violations , several are foods that certain ethnic communities in the United States consume at a higher rate than other ethnic American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which many communities are subjected .\nWhile the FDA \u2019 s low sample numbers in 2020 can be excused due to the pandemic , the GAO previously cited the FDA for testing a

to stem the harm.\n\u201d EPA received 3,500 reports of dicamba drift damage in 2021 alone , Freese noted .\n\u201c EPA must end all over-the-top registrations of dicamba herbicides , before farmers , beekeepers , rural residents and wild plants and animals experience still another ( seventh ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .\n\u201c There is simply no other solution.\n\u201d The drift damage was so extensive that a federal court stepped in to revoke OTT dicamba registrations in 2020 , in a lawsuit brought by Center for Food Safety ( CFS ) and farmers , only for the Trump EPA to resurrect the herbicide four months later .\nCFS \u2019 s challenge to that unlawful decision is underway .\nFreese also noted , \u201c EPA continues to gauge risk to wild plants and animals using the same defective models and assessments that entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crops.\n\u201d Troublingly , EPA \u2019 s modeling is out of step with real-world experience , falsely suggesting that dicamba sprayed in the traditional way at planting time with conventional crops poses a greater drift threat to plants than over-the-top use on dicamba-resistant soybeans and cotton in the heat of summer .\nThis erroneous assumption makes EPA \u2019 s dicamba modeling worthless .\nEPA must fundamentally revamp its assessment procedures to fully account for \u201c real world \u201d data of massive drift harm in assessing dicamba \u2019 s risks to wild plants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dicamba can harm bees , but its assessment entirely misses another more serious threat : how dicamba drift decimates flowering plants , robbing bees of their food , nectar , and pollen .\nThis explains why beekeepers in areas hit hard by dicamba drift report huge drops in honey production , particularly in Arkansas and the Dakotas .\nEPA has still not evaluated dicamba \u2019 s risk to endangered plants and animals .", "author": "Sustainable Pulse", "url":

It!", "content": "For decades genetically engineered foods ( GMOs ) on sale in Britain have required a label .\nThis label alerts consumers to the presence of genetically engineered organisms , allowing them to choose whether they wish to buy and eat such foods , Beyond GM recently stated .\nLabelling also allows producers and processors to decide if they want to produce foods containing GMOs .\nIn the UK , the responsibility for food labelling is split across several government departments and agencies .\nThe Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) Is responsible for food policy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and country of origin labelling .\nThe Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) is responsible for policy on food safety , food hygiene ( including allergens labelling ) , imported foods , novel foods and genetically modified foods .\nIt is also responsible for other consumer interests in food , including price , availability and some aspects of food production standards like environmental concerns and animal welfare .\nThe Department of Health and Social Care ( DHSC ) has responsibility for nutrition labelling as it appears on the front of food packaging .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistently show that the public wants genetically engineered foods to be labelled .\nThe draft Genetic Technology ( Precision Breeding ) Bill , currently before Parliament , removes all statutory requirements for labelling of GMOs .\nIt does this by rebranding GMOs as \u201c precision bred organisms \u201d , or PBOs and redefining them as the products of \u201c natural transformation \u201d or \u201c traditional breeding \u201d .\nDevelopers wishing to grow or place PBOs on the market will only need to self-certify that their organisms qualify for a regulatory , and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) has indicated that it intends to remove any labelling requirements for these genetically engineered foods and will also remove these foods from the novel foods register .\nWith no statutory requirement for labelling and no apparent effort on the part of FSA to maintain and enforce labelling , we will no longer know what we are eating .\nHow are our authorities getting away with this ?\nThe abandonment of consumer labelling and rigorous traceability is rooted in the UK government and biotech research establishment \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from genetic modification and that gene-edited foods could have occurred naturally or been created through so-called \u201c traditional breeding \u201d .\nAt the core of this scientifically contested narrative is the lie that gene editing does not involve the insertion of foreign genetic material .\nThis lie has been repeated without critique or question in the media and has served to silence criticism of the technology and obscure the real breadth of the government \u2019 s plans .\nUnder the proposed new legislation , while exempted PBOs can be created using newer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be created using older style GMO techniques , including the insertion of foreign genetic material ( transgenes ) .\nIndeed , right now all three of the crops being trialled in England under new liberalised field trial regulations , were created using transgenes .\nThis abandonment is also rooted in the lie that gene-edited products can not be detected because the changes to a plant \u2019 s genome look no different to those that could have been created in nature or via traditional plant breeding .\nThis ignores the fact that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developers must have a way of detecting and tracking them , and that the protection of valuable GMO patents depends on a reliable detection method .\nEven if this were not the case , existing audit trails provide robust provenance guarantees for a range of products in the food sector , including geographical origin , free-range and barn-reared poultry products .\nThey could easily provide information on genetically engineered crops as well .\nWorryingly , these lies have been circulated throughout Parliament in Defra briefing materials sent to MPs and peers .\nMany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefing documents and summaries of media reports rather than a careful reading of proposed legislation to inform them .\nThis means that those who are debating and voting on this bill are misinformed \u2013 and some would argue are being deliberately misled .\nAs the Genetic Technology Bill continues its progress through Parliament , here are just a few reasons why labelling , transparency and traceability are vitally important .\nIt \u2019 s what the public wants For many consumers , labelling is a clear red line .\nLast year the government asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in regulation of genetic technologies .\nThe overwhelming majority said no ; 85 % expressed the view that the genetic technologies used in farming should continue to be regulated , and therefore labelled , in the same way as other GMOs .\nThis result was not unexpected .\nPublic polls by the Economic and Social Research Council and UK Research and Innovation , the Lloyd \u2019 s Register , the National Centre for Social Research , Food Standards Scotland and the Pew Research Center have all shown little public appetite for genetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey by the Food Standards Agency found that \u201c consumers wanted thorough regulation and transparent labelling if GE foods reach the UK market \u201d .\nThe Nuffield Council on Bioethics public dialogue on genome-edited animals found , amongst other things , that participants had a strong interest and desire to influence the way in which the food they consume is grown and reared .\nParticipants expressed significant concerns over commercial drivers of genome editing in farmed animals , as well as the ability of governance and regulatory systems to control the technology in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK \u2019 s future food system .\nCitizens are major stakeholders in food and farming and their right to choose is also a right to refuse .\nThis can only be exercised fully if products made from genetic engineering technologies or containing genetically engineered plants , animals and microbes are clearly labelled at all stages along the supply chain .\nLabels are the primary source of information about food for most people and as such they are vital to informed choice .\nDuring the oral evidence given at the Public Bill Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chief Science and Regulatory Affairs Adviser at the National Farmers Union and Robin May , Chief Scientific Advisor of the Food Standards Agency , spoke out against labelling .\nProfessor May went so far as to suggest that we don \u2019 t need labels because most of us spend \u201c less than six seconds considering each food item we purchase in the supermarket , which is not enough time to consider the label.\n\u201d That was a very selective ( and unreferenced ) figure which was used to suggest that people don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop and don \u2019 t care about what they eat .\nInstead of Prof May \u2019 s unreferenced study , consider this one , published in 2010 in the Journal of Public Health , which studied 6 European countries including , at the time , the UK .\nIt found that on average shoppers spend 35 seconds looking at labels and that this time goes up or down according to the food they are considering .\nWe spend less time on fresh produce but more on processed and highly processed foods .\nHighly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for GMOs of all kinds .\nIt \u2019 s worth noting also that the CLEAR campaign ( of which we are members ) is currently calling for mandatory method of production labelling .\nWe see the genome editing issue as a bellwether here .\nIf the government truly decides that how a genetically engineered plant or animal is produced is irrelevant and does not need to be included on the label , this takes away the mandate for any other kind of method of production labelling .\nLabelling and traceability are integral to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ builds trust and fosters a stronger relationship between producer and consumer .\nPublic trust in the food system to deliver safe , nutritious food in a way that does not inflict irrevocable damage on our ecosystems is declining .\nA recent survey by EIT Food suggested that shoppers trust smaller shops over large retailers because they are likely to be better informed about the origins of the products they sell .\nRemoving labelling from any type of genetically engineered food can only serve to damage trust further .\nCurrently , in the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a concerted effort to \u201c reassure \u201d consumers about the safety and benefits of gene editing .\nThe long version of the narrative goes something like this : This is a complex issue that only scientists can understand .\nCitizens don \u2019 t trust this technology because they don \u2019 t understand it .\nIt is , therefore , up to scientists to explain it in a way that educates and reassures citizens of its safety and plays up its potential benefits .\nThe short version of the narrative is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this issue , so we can say anything we want without fear of being challenged .\nYou can \u2019 t build trust on a mixture of half-truths and lies , and this view does our citizens a gross injustice .\nIn all our encounters with the public over the years , we have come to understand that most people have a desire to understand and a more nuanced view of food and the food system than they are given credit for .\nWhat is more , for all the talk about trust from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little evidence that government and food agencies have any trust in the public .\nIt \u2019 s not just about safety Citizen concerns are not simply focused on safety and risk but encompass a whole range of issues informed by individual values .\nWithin the food system , these values are addressed by other kinds of labelling : free range , fair trade , organic , cruelty free , no artificial ingredients , vegetarian and that much maligned concept , natural .\nLabelling , in general , allows consumers to have knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resonates with their lifestyle and values .\nAs we said in our own evidence to the Public Bill Committee , most citizens do care about what they eat .\nHowever , most of the food system is hidden from citizen view .\nWhere it is visible people make positive choices .\nCitizens care about what they eat , and they care about how it was produced which is why people look for organic milk , free range eggs , pasture fed meat or fair trade coffee or chocolate .\nIt provides important feedback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only serves the biotech industry and allows it to dictate what people buy and eat .\nBiotech developers believe this creates a \u2018 level playing field \u2019 .\nIn reality , the withholding of information skews buying habits and the real picture of consumer preferences .\nRetailers use information on buying preferences ( conveyed through decisions to purchase or not ) to inform what products they stock and what ingredients they use in their own brand food products .\nThis information can also feedback through the production system .\nWithout labelling this system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary for trade One of the main reasons the UK wants to deregulate the products of gene editing is so that it can import goods , including genetically engineered food , from other countries such as the USA , Canada , Australia and Japan .\nHowever , the global regulatory landscape is currently a jigsaw of many different approaches and requirements .\nWhat does not require labelling in one country may well require labelling in another country .\nWithout traceability and labelling , imported products containing GMOs not exempted in one country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries untraceable and unlabelled .\nIn post-Brexit UK this is a particularly acute issue .\nBy rebranding what constitutes a GMO .\nGM products produced here can not legally be sold unlabelled in places like Northern Ireland .\nIn addition , Scotland and Wales have made it clear , they have no wish to allow such products in their own food systems .\nIt is essential when things go wrong Without labels it will be impossible to trace and monitor GMOs in the environment .\nShould something go wrong we will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these lab-created organisms is essential to allow recall if novel allergens , toxins or other human health or environmental safety issues emerge post-release .\nIt \u2019 s important also to understand that labelling is only one aspect of the broader issue of transparency .\nThe others are traceability and coexistence .\nTraceability means the ability to trace products through the production and distribution chains .\nIt is necessary to facilitate control and verification of labelling claims ; for targeted monitoring of potential effects on health and the environment , where appropriate ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain or consist of GMOs should an unforeseen risk to human health or the environment arise .\nCoexistence \u2013 the right to choose how to farm and the right to choose to buy products from different farming systems \u2013 is fundamental in the UK and no one system should be allowed to impinge on another .\nEquitable coexistence requires appropriate guidelines and measures to prevent field , farm and wider environment impacts ( such as contamination ) and to ensure consistency and enable post-release monitoring where needed .\nAs with labelling , provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technology Bill are sketchy at best .\nFuture regulation may \u2013 or may not \u2013 be brought in and it may \u2013 or may not \u2013 include provision for labelling .\nA public register on the government or FSA website may \u2013 or may not \u2013 be implemented .\nWhile a register is better than nothing , how it will serve citizens wishing to make food shopping decisions remains to be seen .\nHow , for instance , will a busy mother wandering around a supermarket , with two children in tow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website to find the public register and then try to discern whether the food she wishes to purchase contains gene-edited ingredients ?\nOnly clear labelling will provide the information that consumers want at a glance .\nDefra has indicated that voluntary guidelines or third party certifiers could take up the responsibility of labelling .\nBut this option adds an unnecessary layer of complexity and cost for consumers and businesses .\nStatutory regulation , written into the laws of this land , is the clearest and most honest option .\nBut as things stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half baked ideas and vague promises in some distant future .\nDefra \u2019 s stated position and the FSA \u2019 s apparent stance suggest that such promises are misleading , flaky and likely insincere .", "author": "Sustainable Pulse", "url":

Insufficient to Warn Consumers on GMOs", "content": "A U.S. District Court has held that the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) \u2019 s decision to allow genetically engineered ( GMO ) foods to only be labeled with a \u201c QR \u201d code was unlawful , and that USDA must instead add additional disclosure options to those foods under USDA \u2019 s National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard .\nThe Court sent back to the agency the QR code portions of the 2018 Trump administration rules for GMO labeling that went into effect on January 1 , 2022 , which hindered consumer access with burdensome electronic or digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all Americans , \u201d said Meredith Stevenson , Center for Food Safety ( CFS ) staff attorney and counsel in the case .\n\u201c Today \u2019 s decision marks a key step toward ending the food industry \u2019 s deceptive and discriminatory GMO food labeling practices , which have kept consumers in the dark by concealing what \u2019 s in their products.\n\u201d CFS filed the case against USDA in 2020 on behalf of a coalition of nonprofits and retailers , including Natural Grocers , operating 157 stores in 20 states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s largest community-owned food market .\nThe lawsuit followed the USDA \u2019 s rulemaking in December 2018 , which would have discriminated against tens of millions of Americans by permitting the use of QR codes alone on packaging after USDA itself found QR code labeling insufficient .\nThe lawsuit followed an over twenty year campaign led by CFS to get GMO labeling in the U.S. , as it is in over 60 countries around the world , including state legislation and culminating in the first ever federal GMO labeling law .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USDA acted unlawfully in allowing standalone QR code and other digital and electronic GMO labeling , \u201d said Andrew Kimbrell , Executive Director of Center for Food Safety .\n\u201c This should be a warning to the industrial food sector that avoiding clear on packaging labeling by using QR codes alone will not pass legal scrutiny .\nCFS will continue to work to ensure every American \u2019 s right to know what is in their food.\n\u201d The court ruled that USDA \u2019 s decision to allow for electronic or digital disclosure alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QR code \u201d or \u201c smartphone \u201d labeling , without requiring additional on-package labeling , was a \u201c significant error.\n\u201d USDA violated the law in allowing QR codes alone despite Congress \u2019 s \u201c straightforward \u201d mandate requiring the agency to first study whether digital disclosure would provide meaningful information to consumers to improve accessibility , and to remedy it if it found them insufficient .\nIn 2018 , CFS successfully sued USDA to release the study , and it showed conclusively that QR codes would fail .\nBut in this final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe court decision explained that \u201c in mandating a study on the accessibility of the electronic disclosure , and directing the USDA to act only if the electronic disclosure was determined to be inaccessible , Congress clearly intended for the USDA to provide \u201c additional and comparable options \u201d to improve the accessibility of the electronic disclosure method.\n\u201d USDA will now need to revise the portions of its 2018 rules that allow for QR code labeling and remove the option of QR codes alone on the package .\nInstead , USDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclosure option to QR code labeling accessible to all Americans .\nThe court sided with USDA on several other challenges brought by the Plaintiffs , including upholding USDA \u2019 s use of the new , unfamiliar terminology , \u201c bioengineered \u201d and disallowing \u201c GE \u201d or \u201c GMO.\n\u201d The court also ruled that USDA may also continue excluding \u201c highly refined \u201d products from mandatory disclosure unless the GE material is \u201c detectable \u201d by a manufacturers \u2019

Natural Grocers .\n\u201c The public \u2019 s rejection of hidden GMOs has been weighed by the Court to be greater than the agrochemical industry \u2019 s desire to hide GMOs behind incomprehensible bureaucratic rules.\n\u201d \u201c We are very gratified that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard and has removed at least one of the very egregious aspects of it
