Iowa Boys Have Been Charged With Stalking And Murdering Their High School Spanish Teacher", "content": "Two 16-year-old high school boys from Iowa have been charged with the murder of their 66-year-old Spanish teacher , Nohema Graber .\nPolice say the boys spent time planning the November 2 , 2021 murder , following Ms. Graber \u2019 s daily routine before ambushing her on a walk at Chautauqua Park and forcing her into the woods where they beat her to death .\nThe boys returned to the scene of the crime later that day to better hide her body .\nNohema Graber was found underneath a wheelbarrow dead of blunt force trauma to her head .\nShe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noble Chaiden Miller and Jeremy Everett Goodale were students at Fairfield High School in Fairfield , Iowa where Mrs. Graber taught Spanish for almost 10 years .\nPolice say the boys posted about the murder on social media , but those posts have not been identified or released to the public .\nAt least one other student saw the social media posts , which implicated the boys in the teacher \u2019 s murder .\nBloody clothing was recovered from Goodale \u2019 s home and Miller confessed to police that he was involved .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys were charged with the \u2018 extremely brutal murder of an innocent person \u201d .\nWhile not providing evidence to back up their claims , police say Ms. Graber \u2019 s Mexican heritage was not a motive in the murder .\nThe reason she immigrated to the US had been to give her sons a life somewhere they would grow up without having to put bars on the windows .\nThe Iowa town of Fairfield has only 10,400 residents .\nAnother student at Fairfield High School says Ms. Graber was sometimes made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent .\nShe is remembered by the community as an especially encouraging teacher who attended all the school events and concerts she could and joined in school spirit days like pajama day by wearing cat slippers in the hallway .\nThe boys have pled not guilty to first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder and asked the judge to move their case to juvenile court .\nThey are both being held in a juvenile detention facility on a $ 1 million bond but are currently charged as adults .\nIf tried as juveniles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they turn 18 , which means they could only serve very short sentences .\nA hearing will take place on January 27th to determine whether they will be tried as adults .\nTwo of Nohema Graber \u2019 s children have taken to social media to say they forgive the boys for murdering their mother .\nAt a memorial service , her son read a heartbreaking note Nohema had written : \u201c My plan is very simple and I think very powerful .\nMy plan is to smile all of the time .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smile is contagious .\nWhat is a better positive attitude than a smile ?\nI will smile to everybody I will encounter in the building : the administrators , colleagues , custodians , students , etc .\nI will start in the school year .\nSo far I do this already but with this plan I will be sure that I do it all the time and I will be aware of people \u2019 s reactions .\nDealing with young students makes me conscious that in some cases I may be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only Spanish but how to behave and to interact with others .\nWe the teachers must be a positive role model for our students and even if the students forget about my Spanish classes , I hope they will remember how and why to smile to life and be honest.\n\u201d Currently the trial is scheduled to begin on April 19 , 2022 .", "author": "Chrissy Stockton", "url":

true crime doc American Murder : The Family Next Door , director Jenny Popplewell explained to Televisual how she became interested in the Watts family story and conceived of a documentary told through social media .\nPopplewell watched the tragedy play out in real time .\nShe was struck by how \u201c normal \u201d Chris and Shanann seemed and then by the abundance of footage of Chris crying crocodile tears .\nWhen body cam footage of the investigation was released Popplewell knew she had a story worth telling to a bigger audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrate so much content and footage from police body cams , the neighbor \u2019 s Ring doorbell , Shanann \u2019 s social media posts , and media interviews .\nIt felt like American Murder : The Family Next Door added a layer of reality and context to the usual gruesome true crime documentary fare .\nShanann , Bella and Celeste became three-dimmensional humans , not just victims .\nThe more we as an audience sat and watched Shanann and her normal life , the less we could say \u201c that couldn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and murder as something that happens to \u201c other \u201d people .\nPopplewell interviewed Shanann \u2019 s family , telling them \u201c We wanted Shanann to be at the centre of this story \u2013 not the murderer , as is the case with so many true crime films \u2013 and they were happy about that.\n\u201d Shanann \u2019 s family gave the director Shanann \u2019 s laptop and phone and later encouraged viewers to watch the documentary , saying they were happy Shanann was able to tell at least part of the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media posts .\nImportantly , the documentary also presented Shanann as a real person , not just \u201c the perfect victim \u201d as many true crime docs tend to do , \u201c All too often , victims in crime documentaries when they do have a moment are presented as having lit up a room , or having the best smile , or being sorely missed .\nSo it was important to show her in an honest , multi-dimensional way.\n\u201d The documentary also delved into what little social media Chris Watts had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Shanann shared : \u201c That is Chris on his own YouTube .\nHe closed his Facebook page a few weeks before the crimes because he doesn \u2019 t want to give himself away .\nBut his YouTube is left up .\nAnd it \u2019 s some kind of like seminar , it \u2019 s a little speech or presentation that he \u2019 s doing for work , for public presentation .\nAnd he \u2019 s chosen to do it on relationship deterioration and repair .\nBut it \u2019 s like listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relationship is .\nThis man has no depth , no emotional intelligence.\n\u201d Notably in the presentation Chris Watts remarks that a relationship could end , \u201c hypothetically \u201d , \u201c if you met someone at work.\n\u201d Popplewell says it \u2019 s exactly this mismatch in emotional intelligence that led Chris to believe his only option was not talking to his partner or even leaving her , but annihilation : \u201c [ Shanann ] says in a text message to a friend that she \u2019 s written him a letter because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings , and it \u2019 ll be better if he writes them down .\nHe never wrote the letter back\u2026 He killed her instead.\n\u201d One scene that didn \u2019 t make the doc was a clip from the couple \u2019 s wedding where they played a variation of \u201c The Newlywed Game \u201d .\nAs Popplewell told MovieMaker : \u201c They sit back-to-back , they \u2019 ve got a paddle each , and [ the DJ ] says , who kissed who first , and they put up the paddle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s corroborated with her story .\nYou know , she \u2019 s a divorcee .\nHe \u2019 s pursued her .\nShe \u2019 s done with men .\nShe doesn \u2019 t just want another relationship .\nShe \u2019 s pushing him away .\nBut he wears her down and she decides , okay , he \u2019 s the one for me , \u201d Popplewell said .\n\u201c And then the next question is , \u2018 Who said I love you first ?\n\u2019 I was expecting it to be Chris again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They put the paddle up , and it was Shanann .\nI just thought , exactly .\nThis is who she was .\nShe was someone who wore her heart on her sleeve .\nAnd she if she felt something she told you , she was so open with her friends .\nShe \u2019 s open with her family .\nShe was open with Chris and he was not .\nAnd yeah , she loved him .\nWhen she loved him , she told him .\nAnd when there was trouble , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he could not offer that courtesy.\n\u201d The director said her goal was to reach people who have been desensitized by watching true crime shows .\nShe adds that what people should take away from American Murder : The Family Next Door is that \u201c We need to refocus on familicide , femicide , violence against women .\nWe need to remember these are real stories about real people , not just numbers .\nAnd we need to be aware they are an ever-growing problem everywhere , in every country ,

, with a promise that the full trailer will air this weekend during the Super Bowl .\nProduction has been tight-lipped on what exactly Nope is going to be about .\nPretty much all we \u2019 ve been told is that it will star Daniel Kaluuya ( who starred in Get Out ) , Keke Palmer , and Steven Yeun and that Jesse Plemons passed on a role .\nThe teaser revisits Peele \u2019 s first two film \u2019

s old hits ?\nOne TikToker has a wild theory that has me super excited to see the full trailer .\nUser straw_hat_goofy who also talks about movies on YouTube , wonders whether the meaning behind the teaser may be to set up Nope as the third act of a trilogy .\nTake a look at his video : One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosely say , Nope , Get Us Out .\nFamously , Get Out takes its title from an Eddie Murphy stand-up special where he jokes about white people in horror movies .\nThe trope is that while black families would stay away from a haunted house , white families would move right in .\nMurphy says that in The Amityville Horror the poltergeist literally told them to \u201c get out \u201d of their home , \u201c White people stayed in there , now that is a hint and a half for your ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuck out out ?\n\u201d I would just tip the fuck out the door.\n\u201d Again , Us deals with themes of identity and marginalization in the United States ( which interestingly is usually shorted to US ) .\nWhile Nope will likely deal with these themes as well just because of who Jordan Peele is as an artist and what makes him curious , his first two films are also perfectly set up for a trilogy .\nWhether Nope is the third part in a trilogy or just an excellent horror film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Jordan Peele has cooked up for us and I will be tuning into the Super Bowl for exactly two reasons :

when my chronic migraines started , I just answer \u201c for as long as I can remember.\n\u201d I may not remember the beginning , but I do remember how bad they were as a kid .\nI remember getting home from elementary school to an empty apartment , crumpling on the floor between the coffee table and our old brown couch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember laying in my bed with a cold , wet washcloth draped over my eyes and forehead , blocking all light and sound .\nLight was the enemy .\nMovement was the enemy .\nAnything other than sleep\u2013which wasn \u2019 t likely to come , as the pain was too much\u2013was the enemy .\nOften , I would wake up already in the middle of a full-blown migraine .\nI \u2019 d miss the telltale signs of an impending episode because I was fast asleep .\nRather than greeting the day with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what \u2019 s to come , I \u2019 d see my pale , blurry face in the mirror .\nI \u2019 d wet a washcloth and crawl back into bed , often with tears streaming down my face .\nMigraines run in the family , my mom would say , and my grandma \u2019 s had gotten much better as she \u2019 d finished puberty .\nThe years ticked by , puberty came and went , and still I was plagued by this illness .\nMRIs showed nothing but a nice , squishy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain relievers and new migraine medicines barely made a dent in the creeping ivy of migraine that had woven its way around my head and neck .\nI missed a lot of school .\nI missed out on concerts with friends .\nI often missed out on just living life .\nWhen I \u2019 d explain why I couldn \u2019 t make it , I \u2019 d sometimes get the \u201c just a headache \u201d line .\nInvisible illnesses are like that .\nThere \u2019 s no proof someone can see , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That \u2019 s the thing : If you \u2019 ve never experienced a migraine , you might not know how truly debilitating it is .\nI once heard someone describe a migraine like this : \u201c It \u2019 s just like an ice cream headache , but it doesn \u2019 t go away after a few seconds .\nIt sticks around for hours .\nSometimes days.\n\u201d The pain crushes into the side of my head and neck .\nSometimes it \u2019 s a dull weight .\nOthers , like an ice pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , and into the side of my nose .\nThe pain is extreme , so bad that the urge to call 911 often creeps up .\nThen the thought of the searing bright hospital lights keep me from making the call .\nMigraines come with a unique nausea .\nLike a queasiness in your head , rather than your stomach .\nIf the queasiness is too much , vomiting is sure to follow .\nI can barely concentrate , and the effort of stringing together a coherent sentence is sometimes impossible .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of my migraine triggers , explaining why mine were so terrible as a teen , since I was chugging Wild Cherry Pepsi like it was water .\nAnd that \u2019 s the shitty thing about migraines .\nMigraine triggers are plentiful for people , and often remain a mystery .\nIn addition to caffeine , I also have lack of sleep , skipping meals , and perfume to thank for triggering some of my migraines .\nAnd yet still I have more that I haven \u2019 t discovered .\nBut there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what could be a trigger .\nCaffeine is a perfect example .\nFor some , it actually helps their migraines .\nFor me , it only makes it worse .\nCoordinating with other migraine sufferers devolves into : \u201c Have you tried this ?\n\u201d \u201c Yeah , that didn \u2019 t work for me.\n\u201d In high school , as I inched ever closer to graduation day , a feeling of doom slipped over me .\nIf I couldn \u2019 t make it even one week without missing at least a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how would I ever make it out there in the \u201c real world ?\n\u201d The real world , with its set-in-stone work hours and bosses who won \u2019 t even let someone stay home sick when they were missing limbs .\nThe future seemed bleak .\nI wish I could say that my migraines got better .\nNow in my 30s , they \u2019 re still an almost daily struggle .\nI \u2019 ve been working with a neurologist for years now , trying all sorts of new migraine medications and treatments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injections of Botox for Migraine every three months for the past year .\nHas it helped ?\nA little .\nWhen I was a kid , every migraine was a 10/10 on the pain scale .\nNow I can call many of my adult migraines \u201c mild.\n\u201d When you live with chronic pain for decades , you come up with all sorts of ways to cope .\nI have a red armchair I got from Goodwill when I was moving into my first apartment .\nI called it the \u201c headache chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck just right so that it can sometimes stop a migraine before it gets too bad .\nI have knee-high socks filled with uncooked rice that I can heat up in the microwave if cold isn \u2019 t the thing I need .\nI carry topical muscle rubs with me wherever I go so I can stop something from getting too bad that I can \u2019 t drive myself home .\nI \u2019 m a wealth of knowledge , a ledger of all of the little things that work and don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my migraines in a little bullet journal I keep on my desk .\nEach day , I mark lines for the state of my head .\nVertical slashes for \u201c just a headache , \u201d cross-hatched vertical and horizontal lines for migraines .\nA day from from slashes marks a

A Time Slip \u2018Hot Spot\u2019 In Liverpool", "content": "A \u201c time slip \u201d is a paranormal experience where a person accidentally travels through time .\nGenerally the person has no idea how the time travel occurred and is not in control of where they go .\nUnlike \u201c missing time \u201d , a similar experience associated with alien abductions , a time slip can be forward or backward in time .\nObviously since time travel is currently thought to be impossible , \u201c time slips \u201d aren \u2019 t thought to be real even though there are some pretty convincing individual reports of the phenomena .\nFor instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting one particular location they say is a \u201c hot spot \u201d for time slips .\nIn the city center , the Bold street area has been the location where many people have reported accidental time travel .\nOne of the most credible reports comes from an off-duty policeman who was in the area shopping with his wife .\nHere is that report from the Liverpool Echo : \u201c One Saturday in July 1996 , Frank and his wife Carol visited Liverpool to do some shopping .\nAt Central Station , the couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bookshop in Bold Street to purchase a copy of Irvine Welsh \u2019 s book , Trainspotting , and Frank went to a record store in Ranelagh Street to look for a CD .\nAbout 20 later he walked up the incline near the Lyceum which leads onto Bold Street , intending to meet up with his wife in the bookshop , when he noticed he had somehow entered a \u2018 dead spot \u2019 of quietness .\nSuddenly , a small boxvan that looked like something out the 1950s sped across his path , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him .\nFrank noted that the van had the name \u2018 Caplan \u2019 s \u2019 emblazoned on its side .\nFrank crossed the road and saw that Dillons Bookshop was no longer there .\nIn its place stood a store with the name \u2018 Cripps \u2019 over its two entrances .\nThe policeman was understandably confused .\nHe looked in the window of Cripps and saw no books on display , but women \u2019 s handbags and shoes .\nThe policeman turned around and saw that the people on Bold Street were wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Forties and Fifties ; the men wore trilbies and long overcoats and the women wore scarves , berets , pillbox and cartwheel hats and most of the ladies also wore gloves .\nThen the possibility that he had somehow walked into the Bold Street of 40-odd years ago dawned on the policeman .\nFrank sighted a girl of about 20 , dressed in the clothes of a mid-1990s girl ; hipsters and a lime-coloured sleeveless top .\nThe bag she carried had the name Miss Selfridges on it , which really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow partly in 1996 .\nHe smiled at the girl as she walked past him and entered Cripps .\nAs Frank followed her , the whole interior of the building changed in a flash to the interior of Dillons Bookshop .\nThe policeman was back in his own time .\nHe grabbed the girl by the arm at the entrance of the bookshop and asked her : \u201c Did you see that then ?\n\u201d and the girl calmly said , \u201c Yeah .\nI thought it was a new shop that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at the clothes , and now it \u2019 s a bookshop.\n\u201d The girl just chuckled , shook her head , and walked out again .\nWhen Frank told his wife about the incident , she said that she had not noticed anything strange , but Frank was really adamant that he had not hallucinated the episode .\nI gave an account of this strange timeslip on the Billy Butler show , and within minutes , people were ringing me and Billy to tell us that in the late 1950s and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Cripps in the exact location where Dillons ( and later Waterstones ) Bookshop now stands , and there had also been a firm called Caplan \u2019 s in existence around the same time.\n\u201d Obviously this story could be made up .\nPeople do play hoaxes on the media .\nBut this isn \u2019 t the only report of a time slip in the Bold street area .\nA shoplifter running from a security guard also experienced a time slip in the area and was able to see that it was 1967 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a corner stand .\nThe security guard in that story also remembers the strange event from his perspective , he remembers chasing the shoplifter and seeing him literally disappear into thin air .\nAnother report comes from an Englishman who casually saw someone from another time period while riding his bike in the area : Tiktokers have also been sharing stories of people who have experienced time slips around Bold street : So what \u2019 s with all these Bold street time slip stories ?\nIt could be that the area has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so there is a lot of overlapping energy in the space .\nHomes were built in the area in the 1780s when it was the district known for manufacturing rope .\nThe area also has a dark history , it was named for Jonas Bold , a wealthy trader of enslaved people who became the mayor of Liverpool in 1802 .\nThe \u201c bombed out church \u201d , St Luke \u2019 s Church , began construction in 1811 and stands at the top of Bold street .\nIt has not had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands as a memorial to people who

while that is a beautiful and deeply special journey , it can also be difficult at times .\nWhile we navigate relationships , and friendships , and different circumstances in our lives , we can sometimes lose sight of the patterns and the habits of ours that may not be serving us .\nThings like perfectionism and being unconditionally kind to everyone around you can seem harmless , but if taken too far , they can actually end up hurting you , and hindering your growth .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits that you may not realize are toxic \u2014 we hope this list helps for you to open your eyes to certain patterns of yours , and encourages you to reflect on healthier habits you could move towards instead .\n1 .\nWhen You Mistake Repression For Being Calm Being in control of your emotions and appropriately reacting to them in your everyday life is a sign of growth and self awareness .\nHowever , when that is taken too far , and you stop allowing yourself to feel your emotions and validate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self preservation , you \u2019 re actually participating in repression .\nKeeping your emotions bottled up , not communicating , or numbing yourself to experiencing them at all , is a toxic trait because it ends up hurting you more in the long run .\nYou aren \u2019 t actually moving through your journey , or acknowledging all of what is happening inside of you \u2014 you \u2019 re just pushing it further into yourself , and that will only make things worse .\n2 .\nRomanticizing Being Alone And Your Independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is special .\nFostering a sense of autonomy , and independence in your life , is also special .\nHowever , sometimes our alone can become too comfortable of a place , and we end up closing ourselves off in order to protect the safety we have created within our lives .\nRunning away from certain experiences or relationships as a means of protection just keeps you blocked off from the people and the things in life that are trying to find you .\nNo , dependence is not good , but chronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to approach life .\nYou can ask for help , you can express and be vulnerable with others , you can invite other human beings and dreams and goals into your world without having to worry that they will destroy the foundation you have built , and so on .\nTo assume that you have to be alone in order to be happy is a toxic approach to your journey here because human beings need connection \u2014 it \u2019 s just a matter of waiting for the good ones .\n3 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perfectionism might seem like something that should be glorified , but it is actually a toxic mindset .\nPerfectionism has been linked to depression , anxiety , and other mental health struggles because being too focused on doing everything correctly and within a very structured and strict boundary often causes you to beat yourself up for forgivable , and often very human , mistakes .\nHuman beings need to practice self-compassion in light of mistakes \u2014 it is only then that you come to understand and connect with the fact that your journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t always perfect , but it is real , and being able to navigate that in a tender , and understanding way , is how you are kinder to yourself within it .\nSleep is so deeply important for you .\nSleep , especially REM sleep , is actually when you deal with a lot of trauma and healing \u2014 your brain literally rewires itself and heals itself during these cycles , and by not taking the time to allow for your brain and your body to rest , is so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being able to stop , and to allow yourself to decompress , and to focus on something that is good for you in a way that isn \u2019 t instantly gratifying you , is also a way you can learn healthier approaches to your well-being .\nSeeing the value in something like sleep , even when so much more in this world is asking for your attention late at night , or when you \u2019 re extremely busy , is a way you can show yourself that you are someone worth investing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your Own Expense Being a kind , and compassionate , human being is a beautiful way we can learn how to foster unconditional and pragmatic love in our connections .\nHowever , people pleasing often goes beyond genuine kindness , and that can be a toxic approach to relationships because it teaches us that other people \u2019 s wants and needs hold more importance than our own .\nWhen you move throughout your life constantly putting others before you , it makes you vulnerable to being taken advantage of by those who may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it can also leave you feeling burnt out and resentful in your connections .\nAt the end of the day , it is important to remind yourself that you need to nourish and take care of your own wants and needs , and set boundaries with those in your life so that you aren \u2019 t always pouring from an empty cup .", "author": "January Nelson", "url":

comes in and sets up camp right next to us with a tiny patch of bush between .\nBeing the middle of winter the place was deserted .\nAs the morning began he started asking the three of us if we wanted him to take us up to the abandoned gold mine that afternoon .\nTwo of the three of us had made the trek numerous times but didn \u2019 t bother saying anything and were non-committal .\nAs morning drew into afternoon he finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went .\nOn the way up there he was acting a bit nutty and diving into ice cold rock pools and he had a large Bowie knife strapped to his leg .\nAnyway it was about a 6km hike up to the mine and he was telling us how he \u2019 d been up there ample times , with us smirking at each other as we had been up heaps .\nAbout 5km in he says let \u2019 s start heading up the mountain at which point we were looking at each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom and up here nothing but thick rainforest .\nSo at one point I \u2019 ve turned to look over my shoulder at my mate only to find he was gone and I was about 15 feet behind this bloke in the middle of nowhere about an hour before dark .\nMy guts just dropped and I instinctively turned and fled .\nNow I had been a long distance runner but I don \u2019 t ever think I \u2019 ve ran so fast .\nWhen I made it back to camp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me was holding a rifle and freaking out , asking questions like what was he gon na do ?\nI said give me the rifle and start packing up .\nJust as they started this guy came tearing through the bushes and was manic laughing , then he seen me with the rifle and mumbled something as he walked through the bushes .\nThis really freaked us out and we packed within a half hour .\nHe must have really legged it back to be that close behind us .\nWe were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this remote spot safely .\nIt wasn \u2019 t until years later we had watched something on the TV and were on the phone to each other that we come to realize the man was Ivan Milat who went on to

Dollhouses That Went Viral On TikTok", "content": "If you haven \u2019 t heard , American Horror Stories is coming back soon !\nSeason two is going to have a creepy dollhouse theme \u2013 which is why this is the perfect time to create your own haunted dollhouse .\nThere \u2019 s been a growing trend on TikTok where people take old houses that they \u2019 ve had from childhood ( or have found at garage sales ) and convert them into haunted houses .\nThis is a creepy DIY decoration you can put out for Halloween \u2013 or can leave on your shelf for the whole year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the haunted dollhouses that went viral on TikTok , here are a few ideas on how to get started : Take your favorite dollhouse and paint it black .\nThe first step to creating a haunted dollhouse is finding a regular dollhouse that will work well with your vision .\nMost dollhouses come in bright colors like pink or purple , so you should start by covering the exterior of your house with black paint ( and maybe a little purple if you want to give off Victorian vampire vibes ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ add some gray to the exterior in order to make the house look older and abandoned .\nThen board up some of the windows with popsicle sticks if you want to make it look even creepier !\nAdd the right wallpaper for your theme .\nOnce you \u2019 re finished with the exterior of your dollhouse , you should move onto the interior .\nBefore you start adding decorations , you should make sure you \u2019 re happy with your walls .\nFind a material that you like at a craft store and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .\nOr , if you don \u2019 t want to spend too much money , you can always print out designs from your own home .\nThen , if you \u2019 re going for a more gory , gruesome house , you can add blood to the walls and floor once you \u2019 re finished .\nAll you need is some red paint to splatter .\nAdding cobwebs to your dollhouse is a great way to make it look like a ghost town .\nYou can pick up some white webs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then simply spread them around the dollhouse the same way you would do around your own house at Halloween .\nAlthough you might want to add cobwebs to the corners of the room early on , make sure you save some to use for later .\nOnce you put your props down , you might want to spread some cobwebs over them too so it looks like clocks and couches haven \u2019 t been touched in a while .\nYou can add more than just dolls to your house .\nYou can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeletons , and candles .\nAnd you don \u2019 t have to stop at the inside !\nYou can add props to the exterior as well .\nTry making some dead trees by grabbing branches from the yard and spray painting them black .\nThen add some moss around the bottom of their trunks to simulate the grass .\nYou can also create crooked \u2018 iron \u2019 railings and place them around the property to warn visitors to keep out .\nIf you \u2019 re willing to put extra effort into your dollhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can add lights to each room .\nYou can do this by creating walls on art board and pulling the wires through the back , then placing the boards into the house .\nThis step requires a lot of extra work , but if you \u2019 re planning on keeping this dollhouse in the family for generations , it \u2019 s worth the effort !\nStart by gluing a bunch of stir sticks together and staining it , then add spackle .\nNext , sand it down and peel off places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it \u2019 s crumbling .\nTo finish it off , you can trace the cracks with a knife and paint inside the cracks to make sure that they stand out to anyone looking inside .\nThen you can add some green or brown flocking fibers to create the appearance of mold !\nIf you plan on passing down the dollhouse to your grandchildren , then you can add some little treasures for them to find \u2013 if they look hard enough .\nYou can write them little notes or even create puzzles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even print out miniature pictures of yourself and your family and add them to the walls with little picture frames .\nPut the finishing touches on the house .\nOnce you \u2019 re finished adding your furniture , try to get creative .\nYou can add doll limbs dangling from the ceiling or draw pentagrams on the floor , whatever you think will take your house to that next level !\nIt \u2019 s always a great idea to have a theme you can stick to \u2013 like crime scene or haunted house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration from movies and shows that have a similar theme .\nRemember , the more creative you are with your haunted house , the better .\nDon \u2019 t be afraid to get weird !", "author": "Holly Riordan", "url": "https://thoughtcatalog.com/holly-riordan/2022/07/how-to-create-the-haunted-dollhouses-that-went-viral-on-tiktok/",

can \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not alone Is it just paranoia ?\nMaybe .\nIt \u2019 s not abnormal for our brains to play tricks on us , especially if we \u2019 re already feeling uncomfortable or skeptical .\nBut if your intuition is seriously telling you that something feels off or that you \u2019 re being watched , sometimes you just have to trust your gut .\nWhen paired with any of these other signs , a prickly feeling at the back of your neck or a chill down your spine can be a great indication that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n( Similarly , if something feels bad , trust yourself\u2014your sense of self-preservation is probably kicking in . )\n6 .\nYou \u2019 re not the only one who feels this way If you live with someone who has similar concerns , or if you \u2019 ve shown the space to a friend who agrees that something feels off , there \u2019 s a chance it \u2019 s really not just you .\nIf there really is something haunting your attic , it \u2019 s unlikely that you \u2019 ll be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell .\n( That being said , there will also always be people who will adamantly insist that there are no such things as ghosts\u2014probably don \u2019 t go to them for an objective opinion . )\n7 .\nYou \u2019 ve looked up the history of your living quarters\u2014and it \u2019 s not great If you \u2019 re seriously concerned about a haunting , do your research .\nIs your house particularly old ?\nCan you find some of the previous tenants to ask about their experiences in the house ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ your address ever end up in the news for something awful , like murder or abuse ?\nWhile many tragedies aren \u2019 t reported , there \u2019 s still a chance that you could find something that might point to some restless spirits residing in your attic .\nThe fact of the matter is this : When dealing with the paranormal , it \u2019 s difficult to find concrete answers .\nThe best thing you can do is trust your senses and your gut\u2014because sometimes ,

Halloween !\nWhile the newer It movies are great , nothing beats the snaggle-toothed , watery-eyed horror of Tim Curry \u2019 s Pennywise .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite red-headed short king Seth Green as a young Richie Tozier .\nSure , some of the acting is cheesy and the made-for-TV budget means this Stephen King adaptation took a hit , it \u2019 s still a classic that hits the spooky-bone over 30 years later .\nCatch the original It on Amazon Prime or HBO Max .\nAs you \u2019 ve probably noticed , when you \u2019 re a horror fan there \u2019 s very little that will actually scare you

Collective World Careers newsletter .\nToday , we \u2019 re talking to internationally best-selling author Brianna Wiest about her journey as a writer navigating social media , creating momentum , and selling 1 million books .\nOne of my absolute favorite things about that book , and this journey as a whole , is that it was truly passed from one person to the next .\nOften , you \u2019 ll see a book spike in sales when it first comes out because of all the marketing and campaigning an author and their publisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really a perennial seller , an evergreen .\nA book that sells because a person had such a deep and meaningful experience with it and want the people in their lives to have it too .\nTotally surreal .\nI absolutely never get used to it , it \u2019 s incredible every time another video pops up on my FYP .\nBefore TikTok , what were your main marketing avenues ?\nHow did you get the word out about your books ?\nI think it was mostly Instagram .\nI didn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one element of 101 Essays at least that really worked well in my favor is that the cover is very neutral , it fits with a lot of different aesthetics , and so I think a lot of people bought it for that reason alone , it just looked appealing in some way .\nNo , you \u2019 re not supposed to judge a book by its cover , but I think in this case , it was helpful .\nOther than that , I really believe what matters most is maintaining an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you make someone buy a product , but how you create something people naturally desire .\nAnd I think a lot of that is a matter of just writing what you \u2019 d need to read .\nWhat does the writing routine of an international bestseller look like ?\nIt \u2019 s changed over the years .\nAt the beginning , when I was working heavily in news writing , I would write multiple articles per day .\nI think that experience was important because it strengthened my creative muscles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the momentum going .\nBack then , I believed strongly in waking up and just writing , first thing .\nNo hesitation , no overthinking \u2014 just flow .\nI still believe that \u201c writer \u2019 s block \u201d is just not knowing what you want to say , or trying to say it in a way that \u2019 s too far removed from how you naturally think or speak .\nIf you address those two issues \u2014 you have a clear point to make , and are ready to share it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you \u2014 you \u2019 re golden .\nThese days , I mostly just write when I feel like it .\nWhat is the biggest piece of advice you \u2019 d give someone just starting out their writing career ?\nI would say that there is a difference between being a career author \u2014 as in , it \u2019 s a job that pays the mortgage \u2014 and being an author because you feel called to it .\nSometimes those two things can overlap , but sometimes they don \u2019 t .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditate on which you want , because if it is the former , you need to build an audience who enjoys what you do , and your metrics matter \u2014 a lot .\nIf it \u2019 s the latter , you \u2019 re on a spirit-led journey to be a medium for other human beings , in my opinion .\nWhether you entertain , enlighten , heal , inspire or make people laugh with your writing , you touch lives in one way or another .\nIf you can find a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @", "author":

sometimes you want to partake in the creepy episodes of your favorite sitcoms .\nToday , we \u2019 re talking about everyone \u2019 s favorite workplace comedy set in Scranton , Pennsylvania : The Office .\nOver nine seasons , The Office had only six Halloween episodes , but what we do get is often some of the funniest of their respective seasons .\nWatch for the ridiculous costumes ( like Oscar as an \u201c informed consumer \u201d or Jim as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the development of all your favorite characters with a spooky backdrop .\nFrom your resident Office stan , check out my definitive ranking of the best The Office Halloween episodes .\nThis includes the now-banned cold open from season 6\u2013and where to watch it .\nHalloween is supposed to be fun , but this post-Michael Scott episode didn \u2019 t get the inter-office memo .\nIt \u2019 s the beginning of Andy Bernard \u2019 s reign as boss of Dunder Mifflin Scranton , which most Office fans agree is a crash-and-burn story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his drama with Erin in this episode , as well as trying to impress Robert California , it \u2019 s more of an unfunny slog than a madcap holiday episode .\nHere \u2019 s another one where the Halloween aspect of the episode is only for the cold open\u2013although you can still catch this on Peacock or in reruns , unlike \u201c Koi Pond \u201d below .\nAll we get in this is a look at a handful of costumes .\nWe have Kelly teetering on insanely high high heels as Carrie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat \u201d in a Broadway-inspired Cats costume .\nThe best though is three people wearing the exact same Joker costume ( the Heath Ledger variety ) with Creed , Kevin , and Dwight .\nWhile this is a great episode for the emotional road trip send-off for Holly , the ultra-short Halloween section is pretty forgettable .\nOkay , the Halloween aspect to this episode is only in the cold open , but hey , it still counts .\nThe only problem is that if you go back and watch the episode on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there .\nIn this segment , the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin is hosting a kids \u2019 haunted ride in the warehouse .\nIt isn \u2019 t the the \u201c dick in a box \u201d costume Michael \u2019 s wearing that made this segment get banned .\nRather , it \u2019 s Michael Scott pretending to hang himself during the climax of the ride .\nNBC has since removed it from reruns and their Peacock subscription service , but you can find the clip on their official YouTube page if you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s \u201c Facebook \u201d costume\u2013this The Office Halloween episode gets a higher spot on the list .\nThanks for the peak Office cringe .\nThe last season of The Office was a great send-off to a beloved show , and their final Halloween episode \u2019 s included in that .\nWhile it does feature a fighting Pam and Jim ( no thanks ) , it has some great character development for Dwight as he realizes he may need help from Nellie .\nAnd speaking of series newcomer Nellie , she has what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any Office Halloween episode : HR Toby .\nAnd this is made even funnier by Toby \u2019 s horned-up reaction to a woman dressed as him .\nThis episode is proof that they could still write gems even after Steve Carell left the show .\nThe very first Halloween episode of The Office is a classic .\nIt has the lightly cringy feeling of the early seasons of the show with the romantic tension between Jim and Pam that hasn \u2019 t yet boiled over .\nThe drama is less about Halloween itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire someone by the end of the day .\nWith Halloween being an incidental backdrop rather than a plot point , this episode just misses the top spot for best Office Halloween episode .\nThe Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch is holding a costume contest for Halloween , if they can avoid the drama between Michael and Daryl .\nThis is the Halloween episode from when The Office had really hit its stride .\nWe get some of the best costumes overall of any episode ( especially Gabe as Lady Gaga ) .\nPlus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim comes fully dressed in an actual Halloween costume\u2013and his reasons are adorable .\nThere \u2019 s the right balance of cringe , hopefulness , and comedy that makes this show a must-watch so many years later .", "author": "Trisha Bartle", "url":

Hello , my name is Molly Burford and I am a former manifestation skeptic .\nAfter all , manifesting sounded too passive , too good , and too simple to actually work .\nI mean , think good things and good things will happen as a result ?\nAs if .\nTo me , manifesting sounded like a used car salesman promising me a 2003 Toyota would drive like a Tesla if I just *~wished~* it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much about cars , but I \u2019 m gon na say that \u2019 s highly unlikely !\nThat said , I \u2019 ve been in a rut for the past couple of years , despite many wonderful and transformative things happening around me and to me .\nEven though things looked great on the surface , I was still deeply unhappy .\nI was constantly feeling alone , lost , and anxiety-ridden .\nSomething had to change .\nIn addition to returning to therapy , I have been doing my own research about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contentment .\nInterestingly , manifesting continuously popped up during my Google searches and social media scrolls .\nSince what I had been doing clearly wasn \u2019 t working , I decided to dig deeper into other routes , and this included manifestation .\nAs it turns out , I didn \u2019 t know much about manifesting because my ideas about the practice were completely wrong .\nAnd , not only was I misunderstanding what manifestation was , but I was also doing myself and my life a disservice .\nBut as a total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t exactly sure where to start my own manifesting journey .\nThat \u2019 s where Victoria Jackson comes in .\nJackson is a certified mindset coach and founder of The Manifestation Collective .\nShe also has a debut book arriving on December 1st , 2022 , Manifesting for Beginners .\nRead on below to learn more about manifestation for beginners as well as Jackson \u2019 s upcoming book .\nFirst , a basic definition .\n\u201c In the simplest of terms , manifesting is to create your reality with your thoughts , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal law of attraction , the energy we put out is the energy we receive back , and we are manifesting every second of each day .\nBy co-creating with the universe and understanding how the law of attraction works , we can consciously manifest our dreams and desires by changing our thoughts and what we focus on.\n\u201d That said , manifesting is not just positive thinking and hoping the universe responds by bringing your dreams into the physical world .\nRather , the manifestation process is about harnessing positive energy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things you desire most .\nOne of the basic principles of manifesting is the law of attraction , which is based on the idea that we get back what we put into the universe .\nYou can think of the law of attraction as a stage light .\nThe more light you put on a specific area of the stage , the brighter that area will become and the more attention the audience will pay to that section .\nIn other words , the more energy you put into a specific goal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and help you get to where you want to go .\nManifestation works by meeting the universe halfway with inspired action .\nYou can manifest money , love , a job , a new car , a person , etc .\nthrough various manifestation techniques .\n\u201c When I first discovered manifestation , a lot of the advice on the internet was to let the universe deliver its magic and sit back and wait for it to happen , \u201d says Jackson .\n\u201c Now , as a goal-getter , that really isn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I decided to see how I could put the action into the law of attraction and I found by actually taking steps towards my dreams and meeting the universe halfway , I was manifesting incredibly quickly .\nThis is why I like to combine soul with strategy in everything I teach .\nThat \u2019 s where the real power is.\n\u201d There are a number of different manifestation techniques to utilize the law of attraction and help you manifest what you want in your future .\nVision boards are a fantastic tool to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can do this digitally , such as designing a board on Canva and setting it as your computer background or with good old collage methods using magazine clippings .\nIn terms of what you \u2019 d put on your mood board , it should be visuals that evoke what you seek .\nThose interested in manifesting love , for example , might use imagery of what they imagine their ideal soulmate might look like .\nFor those more interested in manifesting money , they may use imagery of what their money would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new car , etc .\n\u201c In terms of mindset , there is real power in seeing something visually on a daily basis to help your reticular activating system filter out things that don \u2019 t align with your dream vision and help you achieve your goals quicker , \u201d says Jackson .\nJournaling is another great way to help you manifest .\nHowever , you must be intentional about what you journal about .\n\u201c Journaling is actually my most successful and favorite form of manifesting .\nI like to sit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self ( this is called scripting ) and I describe my day as if my desires have already come to fruition , \u201d Jackson tells us .\nIn other words , journal in the present tense as if you are already living your best life and watch your dreams become reality .\nLearn more about scripting on Jackson \u2019 s blog post here .\nExpressing gratitude is a fundamental component of the manifestation process .\n\u201c Manifestation has always allowed me to see situations differently .\nWhile I don \u2019 t believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a range of emotions to be happy 100 % of the time , I do believe we can switch our state to that of gratitude in some small way most days , \u201d says Jackson .\nKeeping a gratitude journal is one way to do this along with other practices such as meditation .\nHow To Begin Your Manifestation Journey In order to start manifesting , there are a number of things Jackson recommends keeping in mind .\n\u201c My biggest tip for any manifesting newbie is to get specific about the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life that looks good on social media , but a life that feels good in the soul , \u201d says Jackson .\n\u201c This is why in my upcoming book , Manifesting For Beginners , I dedicate an entire chapter to soul goals , really getting to the root of what you want from life , because the moment you set the intention for what you actually want , the universe can get to work helping you bring it to fruition.\n\u201d Decide how you want your day to go \u201c A second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want your day to go the moment you wake up .\nYou can control your thoughts by waking up and saying to yourself , \u2018 Regardless of what comes my way today , I am going to thrive rather than just survive.\n\u2019 When you do this , you allow yourself to change the trajectory of your day .\nI always remind my community , that while we can \u2019 t always control what happens to us , we CAN control how we react.\n\u201d \u201c Don \u2019 t become overwhelmed by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the law of attraction .\nThere are no hard and fast rules , the most important thing to focus on is your energy , \u201d encourages Jackson .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t believe that there are any mistakes when it comes to manifestation , only lessons and blessings , but one common struggle I see time and time again is focusing too much on the how and the when , \u201d says Jackson .\n\u201c So , you have created your vision board and on there you have an image to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the universe and set your intention to meet the love of your life .\nHowever , where you begin to strangle your desire , is by trying to control the \u2018 how you \u2019 ll meet them \u2019 and the \u2018 when you \u2019 ll meet them.\n\u2019 \u201d Manifestation , as it turns out , is about relinquishing control as much as it is about letting go of limiting beliefs .\n\u201c You see , the how and the when aren \u2019 t for us to control , this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis is where we have to lean into divine timing and trust that whatever is meant for us will never pass us by , \u201d says Jackson .\nUltimately , to manifest is to hope .\nIt is an act of faith .\nIt is trusting in something greater than yourself .\nIt is about putting in the same energy you want to receive back from the universe .\n\u201c I \u2019 m so excited to launch my debut book , Manifesting for Beginners : A Step-by-Step Guide to Attracting a Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Funnily enough , I actually wrote a Facebook status back in 2017 which said \u201c I am putting it out into the universe that I will sign a book deal \u201d , and then in 2021 I receive an email from the team at Octopus Books that asked if I would like to write a book for them on the concept of manifestation .\nI manifested my book on manifesting !\n\u201d The book itself is broken down into nine chapters , taking a look at everything from soul goals to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe , to taking action , to releasing your grip on your desires , and so much more .\n\u201c I wanted the book to feel light and easy , allowing you to dip in and out whenever you want to reconnect to the universe , \u201d explains Jackson .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a beautiful mix of manifestation and mindset , with spirituality thrown together with science.\n\u201d You can preorder

Brianna Wiest\u2019s Newest Book \u2018The Pivot Year\u2019", "content": "Over the past 10+ years , international best-selling author and writer Brianna Wiest has inspired millions of people around the world to change their thoughts and , in turn , change their lives .\nIn March 2023 , Wiest is back with The Pivot Year , 365 daily meditations for anyone in the midst of their pivot period , the space between where they currently stand and where they want to be .\nIn her own words , here is Brianna Wiest on everything you need to know about her upcoming release , The Pivot Year .\nFirst , tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhat can readers expect from this upcoming release ?\nI know that so many people have such busy schedules and hectic lives , carving out time for self-reflection is hard to do .\nI wanted to create something that would give readers a daily message that could either be something to meditate on or use as a thought exercise , to stretch their perceptions and hopefully begin to plant seeds for deeper and greater revelations to come .\nWhat inspired you to write The Pivot Year ?\nWas it your own pivot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ve gained throughout your years as a writer ?\nA combination of the two ?\nGive me the tea .\nI would have to say that it \u2019 s more about a culmination of the self-work I have been doing for the past ten years .\nI tried to distill all of the ideas that I found to be helpful or expansive into something that is poetic , inspiring and easy to access each day .\nOver the years , your work has been primarily focused on personal transformation and change .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing the way we think , and The Mountain Is You is about changing our self-sabotaging behaviors .\nThe Pivot Year , however , is a little different as the premise is based on the idea that who we are meant to be is already inside of us ; it \u2019 s just a matter of inviting our true selves to come out of hiding .\nWith all of that said , why do you think so many people , myself included , struggle with being their most authentic selves ?\nI hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my work is the idea that our potential is always dormant within us .\nIt \u2019 s a matter of if , and how , we activate it .\nI believe this is a layered process \u2014 changing the way we think , and then behave , consistently .\nThere are many reasons why it can feel hard to be your authentic self .\nFirst , our authentic selves are our most vulnerable selves .\nIt \u2019 s not as painful to have someone reject a version of you that isn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we adopt a lot of our identity through osmosis .\nHuman beings are so incredibly suggestible and adaptable , and this is especially true if we see external consistencies \u2014 we begin to believe that is the only way people can be .\nThis is why it \u2019 s so crucial to expand your perimeter , your circle , your environment .\nIt normalizes differences in a way that makes authenticity feel safer .\nLast , we sometimes have a hard time finding ourselves because our authentic selves are not a product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not who we are when we follow every want , interest or desire on a whim .\nThey are the people we become when we learn to live in accordance with our truest values and ideals .\nThey are the people we become when we begin to hold ourselves to our own standards , and to have more integrity .\nWhat are the biggest takeaways you hope your readers will glean from The Pivot Year ?\nI genuinely hope that there will be days where readers have the words of the day echoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landing place that they can keep returning to .\nIn down-time , or on their commute , or before bed , I would love for them to be able to think about what they read that day and I hope it evokes more self-realization and epiphanies about how to bridge the gap between where they are and where they want to be .\nWhat is your favorite quote from The Pivot Year ?\n\u201c Life will bring you to your knees .\nSometimes with pain , sometimes with beauty , sometimes with both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your defenses and it will give you opportunities to love .\nIt will disguise miracles in the most ordinary moments .\nIt will bruise your heart until it breaks open .\nIt will teach you , slowly , that it \u2019 s not out there , it \u2019 s inside .\nIt \u2019 s all inside .\nIt will go more slowly than you can bear and more quickly than you can imagine .\nIt will lead you down unexpected turns that twist into destiny , and you will learn to trust .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ releasing of the layers of illusion that stand between you and the realization of your soul \u2019 s deepest desires.\n\u201d Finally , when and where will The Pivot Year be released ?\nMarch 2023 , on Shop Catalog , Amazon , Indigo , Apple Books , and local booksellers in the US + Canada .\nThe Pivot Year is available now for pre-order on Shop Catalog .", "author": "Molly Burford", "url":

"Every Authentic American Horror Story That\u2019s Inspired AHS (So Far)", "content": "With Halloween on the way and American Horror Story \u2019 s season eleven release , horror fans are in their element .\nRiddled with jump scares , psychological twists , and characters that haunt our dreams long after the finale , it \u2019 s clear that AHS leaves a lasting impression on its audience .\nWhile its impact is due to several factors , including a killer cast ( pun intended ) and edgy horror themes , it \u2019 s also due to the immense amount of thought , planning , and research that goes into every season and episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AHS harkens back to American history , but each season is centered around numerous allusions to real-life killers , twisted stories , and haunting historical accounts .\nIf you \u2019 re prepared to be even more freaked by AHS \u2019 s unsettling storylines , read on to discover every historical event ( so far ) that American Horror Story is based on .\nMurder House references many true crime cases throughout its episodes and even connotes the \u201c murder house \u201d to well-known creepy houses in the United States .\nThe beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d depicts a killer stabbing two nursing students to death which is directly referencing the 1966 killer , Richard Speck .\nSpeck was a violent mass murderer that bound , strangled , and/or stabbed eight nursing students in Chicago .\nEpisode Five , \u201c Halloween , Part Two , \u201d directly connotes Tate with Columbine \u2019 s shooter , Eric Harris , when they depict him asking one of the victims if she \u201c believes in God \u201d before killing her just as Harris did .\nHigh schoolers in the series also ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was a goal of Harris \u2019 massacre .\nEpisode Nine , \u201c Spooky Little Girl , \u201d vividly portrays the infamous 1947 L.A. \u201c Black Dahlia murder \u201d of Elizabeth Short .\nBoth in the show and in real life , Short is discovered gruesomely bisected and mutilated by a mother and daughter that originally thought she was a mannequin at first glance .\nEven more eerie is that this haunting case has still never been solved .\nThe house depicted throughout season one takes inspiration from many famous American murder houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manor , and the Franklin house .\n2475 Glendower Place was home to Harold Perelson , a cardiologist that murdered his wife , attempted to kill his daughter , and then committed suicide .\nWe see similar ties to the house in AHS as it \u2019 s an evil doctor \u2019 s home and also is the base for many murder-suicides .\nIn a similar vein , the Franklin house was also owned by a doctor known as Dr. George Hodel who was known for his violence and potential link to Elizabeth Short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States for ongoing supernatural happenings and horrors including the 1974 case of Ronald DeFeo murdering his parents and four siblings while they slept .\nRumors say the house continued to be consumed by evil for years to come , not unlike the house we know in AHS .\nWhile Asylum took on many of its own unique , creepy characters , many of them were based on real life monsters such as murderer Ed Gein , Nazi Officer Josef Mengele , and many more .\nOn September 19th , 1961 , interracial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abducted by an alien spacecraft , thus directly inspiring the characters of Kit and Alma Walker .\nBeloved Sarah Paulson \u2019 s character , the journalist Lana Winters , is based on a real woman named Elizabeth Cochran that worked on an undercover investigative assignment for the New York World .\nIn 1887 , she claimed to be mentally insane in order to gain entry to the Women \u2019 s Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell \u2019 s Island .\nSimilar to Winters , Cochran gained fame under the pen name \u201c Nellie Bly \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutality and negelect in a book titled Ten Days in a Madhouse .\nTwisted Dr. Arden from season two , was actually based on a real-life demon : SS Nazi Officer Josef Mengele .\nMengele worked as a physician at Auschwitz and performed outrageous , deadly experiments on innocent people throughout the duration of the holocaust .\nSimilar to Dr. Thredson \u2019 s human home decor derived from his victim \u2019 s bones and skin , real-life murderer , Ed Gein decorated his home with lampshades made from human skin and bowls made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asylums have the reputation to be a place where unsettling events take place .\nHowever , to take that a step further , the American Horror Story team decided to base the gruesome Briarcliff Manor on two eerie institutions where true horrors took place : Willowbrook State School and Rolling Hills Asylum .\nKnown as some of the most haunted asylums in the United States , AHS pulls from their pasts including Willowbrook \u2019 s extreme patient neglect and harmful experiments and Rolling Hills \u2019 long-lasting stories of spirits that still haunt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coven \u2019 s premise harkens back to the Salem Witch Trials as it \u2019 s centered around the story of the last witches who remain .\nHowever , in addition to this historical background , season three also pulls inspiration from many authentic killers and creeps .\nIt \u2019 s even more chilling to discover that the hated Delphine LaLaurie was a real 1800s New Orleans serial killer who bound and tortured a multitude of slaves in her lifetime .\nIn real life , Marie Laveau was a popular New Orleans herbalist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Voodoo.\n\u201d When it comes to authentic Haitian voodoo , Legba is one of the most important players of the loa as he is the first to be called so he can open the gates to the spirit world .\nThe sadistic axeman killer character portrayed in Coven is actually based on a real-life NOLA serial killer from the early 1900s that terrorized the community with death threats if houses didn \u2019 t play Jazz .\nSeason four was comprised of a wide-ranging , unique cast of characters that were inspired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe theme itself is even derived from the hype that developed around circuses in the United States , producing notorious shows like Cirque de Soleil , P.T .\nBarnum \u2019 s \u201c Greatest Show on Earth , \u201d W.W. Cole \u2019 s Circus , and more .\nWhile Elsa Mars was not inspired by one specific person , her character was collectively based on the Weimer culture that sparked Cabaret performances .\nBetween World War I and World War II , Weimer culture fostered a culture of openness through music , art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those in the queer community .\nWhile Edward Mordrake was not a real person , his two-faced character was brought to life from fiction writer , Charles Lotin Hildreth \u2019 s famous character written about in an article titled \u201c The Wonders of Modern Science \u201d published in the 1895 Boston Sunday Post .\nWell known serial killer John Wayne Gacy Jr. , worked as \u201c Pogo the Clown \u201d for many years while he was secretly tormenting and murdering 33 young boys between 1972 and 1978 .\nAfter he was eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Killer Clown , \u201d similar to our terrifying Twisty .\nDuring the 1970s , a man named Paul Bateson was convicted of killing a queer man , reminiscent of Dandy Mott murdering his potential queer lover in AHS .\nEven sadder is that Bateson confessed to killing upwards of seven gay men during the 70s but was never sentenced for these crimes .\nIn 1811 , conjoined twins Chang and Eng prompted curiosity throughout the world when they were born in present-day Thailand .\nKnown as the \u201c original Siamese twins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was previously known as the country of Siam , Chang and Eng directly prompted the creation of Bette and Dot .\nSimilar to our \u201c freakshow \u201d performer Jimmy , Grady Stiles Jr. reigned from a family of circus performers known as the \u201c Lobster Family \u201d for their congenital deformity commonly known as \u201c Lobster Claw \u201d syndrome .\nThis syndrome causes ectrodactyly hands that seemingly resemble lobster claws .\nEven creepier is that real-life performer , Stiles , was a violent drunk that eventually murdered his daughter \u2019 s fiance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Stiles was murdered himself and he was so hated in the community that no one was even willing to be the pallbearer .\nEthel , the \u201c Bearded Lady , \u201d was based on many famous bearded women throughout circus history such as Madame Josephine Clofullia in the 19th century and Barnum \u2019 s Annie Jones better known as the attraction : The Infant Esau .\nKnown as the \u201c Iron Master , \u201d famous strongman Arthur Saxon was born in 1878 and was highlighted as the only man to lift 371 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awe-striking strength became a common trope in circus sideshows , thus inspiring the character of Dell Toledo .\nCommonly known by his stage name \u201c Schiltzie , \u201d Simon Metz was born with a condition known as microcephaly in which your head doesn \u2019 t grow at the same rate as your face .\nThroughout history , circus performers with this condition were deemed as \u201c pinheads \u201d similar to AHS characters Pepper and Salty .\nInspiring AHS character , Amazon Eve , Anna Haining Swan stood at 7 \u2019 11 \u201d and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d when she was a child .\nAfter marrying the \u201c Kentucky giant , \u201d Martin Bates in 1871 who stood at 7 \u2019 2 \u201d , they were touted by the W. W. Cole Circus as the \u201c tallest couple on the globe.\n\u201d Commonly known by his stage name \u201c Sealo , \u201d Stanislaus Berent was born with a condition called phocomelia that genetically stunted his arms .\nHe called himself \u201c Sealo \u201d when he joined the circus as phocomelia literally translates to \u201c seal arms \u201d and later on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character Paul .\nMore commonly referred to as \u201c General Tom Thumb , \u201d Stratton was P.T .\nBarnum \u2019 s first major circus attraction due to Stratton \u2019 s small stature .\nHe toured with the circus for over four decades , joining Barnum \u2019 s sideshows at the mere age of five .\nMa Petite \u2019 s character on AHS directly links back to Stratton .\nAmerican Horror Story \u2019 s fifth season which stars famous popstar Lady Gaga , pulls from many historical legends and authentic killers .\nEpisode four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d even features a scene where notorious murderers like Jeffrey Dahmer , Eileen Wuornos , Richard Ramirez , John Wayne Gacy , and the Zodiac Killer all gather to share dinner .\nOne of the most famous haunted hotels in American history is Los Angeles \u2019 Cecil Hotel where many have met their fate and are rumored to still haunt the halls .\nIn addition to Cecil Hotel , Hotel Cortez also paralleled renowned serial killer H. H. Homes \u2019 \u201c Murder Castle \u201d where he tortured and killed over 25 innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to as America \u2019 s first serial killer , H. H. Holmes confessed to 27 murders in his lifetime , however , researchers point to him committing over 200 tragic killings .\nOne of the eeriest parts of his case was when they discovered that the house he had built included trapdoors , soundproof rooms , gas jets for asphyxiation , and his very own crematorium .\nThis house of horrors was later deemed Holmes \u2019 \u201c Murder Castle , \u201d and his notorious story led to inspire the character of James March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from real-life Countess , Elizabeth Bathory who was a Hungarian noblewoman during 1560-1614 .\nVampiric legends tell the tale that Elizabeth murdered many young virgins in her years to bathe in their blood in order to maintain her youthful beauty .\nWhen she was finally arrested , a number of imprisoned and dying girls were discovered on her property , and it \u2019 s noted that she tortured and/or murdered over 600 women in her lifetime .\nWhile other seasons contain various moving parts or pieces that are grounded in true people or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Horror Story is rooted in the true story of the missing Roanoke colony .\nIn 1587 , Captain John White established a settlement at Roanoke Island in present-day North Carolina with over 150 colonists before shortly returning to England to gather more supplies .\nFour years later , upon his return , he found the settlement in complete ruins with words carved on trees alluding to a friendly Native American tribe down the coast .\nRumors circled of a massacre taking place , but the colonists were never found .\nFurthermore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature from authentic phenomena such as the \u2018 breathing earth \u2019 seen by Shelby when she \u2019 s walking through the woods , similar to the clip below : \u201c Cult , \u201d the seventh season of AHS is completely embedded in topical historical events such as Trump \u2019 s election and the paranoia and fear felt by many communities after the 2016 election .\nThrough the exploration of mental health concerns such as anxiety , phobias , and more , the AHS team aimed to explore the issue of propaganda , fake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful figures in the United States use fear to maintain status and relevancy .\nThe character of Kai Anderson is compiled by collaging aspects of a multitude of notorious cults and cult leaders throughout history .\nFor example , Anderson refers to cult leader Jim Jones as the \u201c Kanye of cult leaders \u201d for convincing his 900 followers to commit suicide in Jonestown by drinking kool-aid poisoned with cyanide .\nAnother example of Anderson \u2019 s culty collaging is when he mirrors the Heaven \u2019 s Gate cult leader Marshall Applegate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Applegate convinced 39 followers to commit suicide in 1997 .\nDunham \u2019 s character corresponds with Valerie Solanas , the woman who attempted to murder Andy Warhol as a part of her overall belief that women should rid the world of men .\nSolanas wrote her famous SCUM Manifesto in 1967 , a year prior to shooting Warhol , which outlined the reasons why men are plaguing society and should be killed off .\nSeason eight of American Horror Story was one that was less grounded in historical events but moreso rooted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a virus turning us into mutant zombies or more realistically , nuclear fallout .\nDue to the United States Cold War with the Soviet Union , North Korean nuclear warheads and threats , and other terrifying factors that continue to loom over America , Apocalypse imagines a reality for a communal American fear : nuclear war .\nSome also say that teaser trailers for the season , like the one shown below , may be based on Shirley Jackson \u2019 s short story \u201c The Lottery.\n\u201d The story places the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lottery is held to see which person from a small village will be stoned to death .\nAmerican Horror Story does an incredible job at placing us in the 80 \u2019 s with their ninth season , 1984 .\nWith references from things as niche as the Wendy \u2019 s \u201c Where \u2019 s the beef ?\n\u201d commercial to things as popular as Friday the 13th , this season grounds itself in a plethora of pop culture chords that scream : we \u2019 re in 1984 !\nHowever , the main historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season is its storyline and characters being centered around the notorious serial killer , Richard Ramirez .\nIn AHS and in real life , Ramirez was labeled \u201c The Night Stalker \u201d and was considered a follower of Satan .\nRamirez often targeted older women and by the time he was caught , he was convicted of 13 murders , even though many believe he committed more .\nThe comparison between the events of this season and the authentic story is strikingly similar , not to mention Zach Villa \u2019 s resemblance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort .\nWhile a double feature that includes vampires may not seem based in fact , much of season ten is actually inspired by the \u201c Cape Cod Vampire , \u201d Antone Charles \u201c Tony \u201d Costa .\nCosta was convicted of killing two women in 1969 although he was suspected to have murdered upwards of eight women .\nHe was known for being an avid drug user that dismembered each victim after they were killed and left bitemarks on their neck postmortem , granting him his vampiric nickname .\nThe likeness between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentions a murder in Truro where Costa \u2019 s killings took place .\nAnother glaring similarity is between the \u201c black pills \u201d residents use to turn into blood-suckers and Costa \u2019 s frequent drug use .\nLastly , with Costa being likened to a vampire and the season being based around blood-sucking monsters , it \u2019 s easy to see where the AHS team got their inspiration .\nNow it \u2019 s time for the mysterious season eleven theme to fully reveal itself so we can all discover what historical mind-fucks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store this October with \u201c New York City .\n\u201d", "author":

healthcare .\nWith that being said , here are the ways I have learned to empower myself with the options I have while making decisions regarding birth control .\nI think one of the best ways you can gain control over any situation is through researching it and understanding all of your options wholeheartedly .\nAs the old saying goes , knowledge is power .\nStart from the ground up : know your choices , what each of them entails , and reflect on which one you feel most confident about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ring , pills , shots , or simply using the rhythm method .\nRead up on these options and talk with your OB-GYN about any questions you have .\nBut in the end , whatever you choose , it \u2019 s good to know all possibilities so you can make the most informed decision .\nAnother thing to stress here : don \u2019 t read reviews and online forums just yet !\nStart with the facts .\nBuild Your Birth Control Community\u2013 Talk With Loved Ones Birth control is super common in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States .\nAccording to the CDC , about 65 % of women in the U.S. between the ages of 15-49 are using some form of contraception .\nSo while it is an intimate topic , it \u2019 s also one that many people are experiencing and discussing .\nAfter gathering your facts , I urge you to lean on your support systems !\nTalk with friends , family , and loved ones about your options .\nHear their experiences and listen in on why they chose certain methods .\nAnd most importantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re feeling when it comes to birth control and which option feels right for you .\nIt \u2019 s so crucial to feel supported and loved when taking a big leap healthwise !\nWhen I first started birth control pills , my body did not react well .\nI was having night terrors and crying at the drop of a hat while feeling like I had no control over my emotions\u2013 it was terrible .\nAt the time , I was blaming these changes on other stressors in my life like school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks to my mom and close friends , my eyes were opened to the fact that these extreme mood swings were not normal and were most likely due to hormonal changes from the birth control .\nBy being open with my loved ones about my birth control decision , I created a community for myself that helped me when I was feeling low and confused .\nThey encouraged me to speak with my gyno and soon after , I switched pills and adjusted to the new pack just fine .\nCommunity and communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it \u2019 s okay to have someone in your corner too .\nThere have been a couple of times when I have experienced a change in my body due to my birth control , as explained in the story above .\nEach time I have first convinced myself that the change is due to something else : stress from work ; I haven \u2019 t been working out as much ; my sleep cycle sucks ; I stopped having sex .\nHowever , yet again , loved ones at the time encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk with my gyno , where I then changed packs , and the problem resolved itself .\nThe bottom line here is to stop gaslighting yourself , honey !\nIf there \u2019 s a change in your bodily routine and you are actively using a contraceptive or any other type of medication , it \u2019 s important to speak with your doctor .\nStress , sleep , and other factors may be impacting you as well , but it \u2019 s important first to check and see if your prescription could be altering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one size definitely does not fit all and I am here to remind you that change is more than okay !\nTake the time and make the appointments to find the best fit for your body and mind .\nDon \u2019 t Buy Into Myths\u2013 Talk With Your OB-GYN Let \u2019 s face it , we \u2019 ve all gone down the rabbit hole of having something physically wrong , talking with friends or hearing something online about it , and then spiraling over internet searches that diagnose us with something terrifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re going to take a walk on the wild side of the internet because your friend told you this or TikTok told you that\u2013 DON \u2019 T .\nEspecially when it comes to birth control , there are so many rumors and myths : you \u2019 ll never have kids ; you \u2019 ll get fat ; you won \u2019 t have a sex drive ; you won \u2019 t be attracted to the men you \u2019 re meant to be with .\nWe \u2019 ve all heard them and many more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recognize that while there might be slight truth in some of these rumors , most of them are entirely false or vastly exaggerated .\nThat \u2019 s why when it comes to any question , concern , or fear that lingers on your mind surrounding emergency or non-emergency contraception options , you should first speak with your gyno .\nNot only will you get the facts from your OB-GYN , but it \u2019 s also reassuring to hear the truth straight from the mouth of a professional .\nA common thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself and my friends have started birth control is the influence others can have on your decisions .\nWhether it \u2019 s a parent or a partner trying to persuade you a certain way , remember that you are the keeper of your own body\u2013 it is yours to protect and nurture however you choose .\nThrough the years I have heard many stories from loved ones about them switching birth control methods due to a partner \u2019 s opinion or influence .\nI have also heard stories of insecurity surrounding intimacy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a partner \u2019 s ideas about birth control .\nBUT , they do not get to choose this for you .\nOne choice is not superior to the other .\nOne choice is not the gatekeeper to more intimacy , a better body , or better sex .\nThat being said , talk to your partner about options and hear their questions/comments/concerns , BUT in the end , choose what you feel in your heart and mind is best for your body .\nThey aren \u2019 t the ones potentially inserting or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if they love you , they should support what you feel is best , not make you feel inferior because of it .\nWe are beautiful , powerful , and knowledgeable .\nWe are smart enough to make our own decisions .\nWe are strong enough to fight for what \u2019 s best for our bodies .\nIt \u2019 s not always easy and there will always be talk , but remember that you are in control and are justified in your decision to do what you feel is right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your body because it \u2019 s yours , no one else \u2019 s .", "author": "Katee Fletcher", "url":

Stop Obsessing Over Someone", "content": "Have you ever met someone and become utterly obsessed with them almost instantaneously ?\nMaybe it \u2019 s someone you went on a few dates with or someone you had a few encounters with and you just can \u2019 t seem to get them out of your head .\nYou barely even know them , but you feel this magnetic pull that you \u2019 re powerless against .\nSome might make the mistake of thinking they \u2019 ve found \u201c the one , \u201d that this person is their soulmate or twin flame or whatever you want to call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told that when you meet the right one you know \u201c know \u201d ?\nWell yeah\u2026 but the obsessive loop cycle isn \u2019 t usually a sign of that , there are often other factors at play .\nLet \u2019 s look at why we become obsessed with certain people and how to break free from the obsessive cycle .\n\u25cf Why it happens Our subconscious is essentially the sneaky puppet master behind most of the decisions we make and the feelings we experience .\nYou may not be able to access memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subconscious never forgets .\nThe subconscious is primarily motivated to heal past trauma , and as such , we tend to be drawn to people who remind us of painful relationships from the past , be it with a parent or significant other .\nI When you meet someone , you are gathering tons of data and this goes far beyond how attractive you find them .\nYou \u2019 re scanning their posture , their movement , their gestures , their tone of voice , the way they look at you , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within another person , again it \u2019 s on an unconscious level , and it sparks something within that causes us to latch on .\nYour subconscious may pull you toward this person in an attempt to heal from the past\u2026 it reasons that if you can get this person to love you , then all the pain of feeling unloved as a child will melt away .\nUnfortunately , that \u2019 s rarely how these things pan out .\nInstead , you end up repeating the same patterns and reaping the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we become obsessed with people because of what they represent to us .\nFor example , let \u2019 s say you were an ugly duckling in middle school and none of the hot guys ( or girls ) were interested in you and this made you feel like an ugly , unworthy loser .\nNow as an adult , you may find you become obsessed with any hot person who shows some level of interest in you ( or mauve they don \u2019 t even show interest ! )\n\u2026 and it goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you feel that if you can get this person to like you , then that will heal the ugly duckling who still resides within you , it will mean you are no longer that person .\nAlso , some people are just validating !\nIf it \u2019 s a guy or girl who could essentially have any partner they want\u2026 you may become obsessed with them because if you can get them to choose you\u2026 well , then that will mean you \u2019 re on that level as well .\nIt will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are someone , you \u2019 ve made it , and you will be OK .\nIt is much easier to lose yourself in someone else than it is to get yourself together .\nWe do this all the time , not just in relationships .\nIt \u2019 s so much easier to put conditions on your happiness\u2026 I \u2019 ll be happy as soon as I lose X amount of weight\u2026 as soon as I have X amount of money in the bank\u2026 as soon as I buy a house\u2026 as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on .\nIn reality , doing this usually signals there \u2019 s something off internally , and rather than fixing it , you blame some external force for it .\nFor example , it \u2019 s easier to ask yourself : How does he feel about me ?\nDoes he like me ?\nIs this the one I \u2019 ve been waiting for ?\nRather than , Do I like me ?\nDo I like my life ?\nAm I even ready for a serious relationship ?\nAnswering the latter batch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wants to do that ?\nWe would so much rather have our soulmate swoop in and make us all whole and healed with one perfect Hollywood kiss .\nWhen we become obsessed or infatuated with someone , we build them up in our minds and don \u2019 t even realize how far from reality we \u2019 ve strayed .\nIt \u2019 s especially easy to do this if someone seems unsure about us , or if they reject us .\nWe assume it \u2019 s because they are a rare and valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more .\nWhen you obsess over someone , you are chasing a dream , not an actual person .\nYou are chasing the fantasy of what it will be like if you manage to get this exceptional being to like you back .\nAlso , when you become obsessed with someone you barely know , your mind fills in the gaps and you end up creating this supreme being who may or may not exist .\n\u25cf Now that we know what causes us to obsess , let \u2019 s discuss some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get to the root of it If you find you get obsessed with certain types of people , then it \u2019 s probably the result of unresolved trauma .\nGet to the root of what \u2019 s causing this\u2026 what are you still carrying around with you from childhood ?\nWhat do you think this other person can save you from ?\nYour past pain and your problems are not going to just resolve themselves one day , you need to challenge your feelings and figure out why you feel the way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you .\nOK , so you catch yourself daydreaming and thinking about how much you like this other person\u2026 stop and ask yourself what qualities does he or she have that I think are so great ?\nWell , maybe they \u2019 re cool , confident , and charismatic .\nOK , now ask how can YOU be those things .\nA lot of the time we become obsessed with certain people because we kind of what to be them\u2026 and we mistakenly think that being with a certain type of person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut that \u2019 s not how it works .\nIf there are certain qualities you admire , then work on cultivating them within yourself !\nAlso , when you catch yourself asking , Does he/she like me ?\nRedirect and ask : Do I like me ?\nDo I think I \u2019 m likable ?\nIf not , then that \u2019 s where you need to be putting your mental energy .\n3 .\nCome back down to earth .\nYou have to recognize when you \u2019 re turning a mortal into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because no one exists on that level .\nIf you find no flaws in another person , that \u2019 s a sign you \u2019 re obsessed and infatuated and not seeing them clearly .\nIt \u2019 s a sign that you are seeking validation or that person represents something to you , as we discussed earlier , so get to the root of what that is .\nGround yourself and return to earth instead of getting swept away in this fantasy .\nThe best part is that when you \u2019 re not caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in the moment and this is how you form a connection .\nYou can \u2019 t connect with someone if you \u2019 re not present and you can \u2019 t be present if you \u2019 re just obsessing and getting lost in a fantasy .\n4 .\nFill the void within you Obsession grows in vacant space .\nWhen we feel like we are lacking something , be it purpose or self-esteem or happiness and so on- we can more easily fall into the obsessive trap .\nIt \u2019 s really because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re missing to someone else .\nBut you need to take control and ownership of your life and fill yourself up with whatever is missing .\nIf you don \u2019 t feel happy , spend some time thinking about when you were happy- what were you doing ?\nWho were you spending time with ?\nWhat was your routine like ?\nAnd try to plug back into sources of genuine happiness for you .\nIf you \u2019 re lacking self-esteem , then look into ways you can increase your feelings of worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your essence and challenging yourself to be better and do better , so start there .\nWhen your life takes on more meaning and purpose , you just won \u2019 t have the bandwidth to become obsessed with someone else , you \u2019 ll be too obsessed with whatever you have going on and this is a good thing !", "author": "Sabrina Bendory", "url":

\u2019 re panicking and don \u2019 t know what \u2019 s going on or how to get it all back on track .\nI totally understand the feelings of panic and insecurity that come rushing through in this scenario .\nAnd I want you to take a big deep breath and just relax because no man is worth working yourself into a tizzy over and this is also very fixable .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relationship and how you handle it has more to do with you , not him .\nA woman who is confident and high value will not be alarmed when a man is no longer chasing her because she knows she is worthy of love and she is lovable .\nShe doesn \u2019 t see this pullback as meaning anything about her because she doesn \u2019 t base her self-worth on how he treats her and responds to her .\nA woman with weak self-esteem will fall to pieces when a guy isn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ll obsess over it , she \u2019 ll worry about it , and then the dynamic is totally off and problems will emerge even though there was nothing wrong in the first place .\nIn a nutshell , the chase has to end at some point !\nThe \u201c chase \u201d or the pursuit is an important component of courtship but it \u2019 s means to an end , eventually , it has to lead to something , ideally a committed relationship .\nAnd there isn \u2019 t as much of a need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAlso , a man will only chase you in proportion to how out of reach you are .\nFishing wouldn \u2019 t be a sport if the fish swam up to the surface and said here I am !\nIf he \u2019 s caught you , if you \u2019 re there , if you \u2019 ve been won , if you have given yourself to him fully , then there really isn \u2019 t much of a need to chase .\nIn the beginning , his competitive drive is activated , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd the way he behaves isn \u2019 t always an indicator of how much he likes you because he doesn \u2019 t really know you yet .\nIn the beginning , he \u2019 s really trying to get you to like him \u2013 and yes of course he also has a baseline level of interest in you , but he \u2019 s much more motivated to win you over .\nA lot of women notice that once they reciprocate this level of interest , he seems less enthusiastic .\nThey may interpret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest ( usually those with low self-esteem will see it that way ) , but really , he \u2019 s just settling into a more sustainable routine because chasing and pursuing you at that level isn \u2019 t realistic .\nAnd it \u2019 s a good thing when you reach that place !\nSo let \u2019 s talk about what to do when this happens so you don \u2019 t mess everything up\u2026 What To Do When a man stops chasing , just relax .\nYou have to be calm about it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ panicked , frenzied state of mind .\nHere is a good exercise to try .\nSo you \u2019 re having all these obsessive , spiraling thoughts .\nStop and just notice the thought for a minute .\nMaybe you \u2019 re thinking , \u201c I can \u2019 t believe he \u2019 s losing interest in me , what did I do ?\nHow do I fix this ?\n\u201d Now ask yourself : Does this thought serve me well ?\nDoes this take me where I want to go ?\nAnd the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this activate your fears and insecurities .\nThey make you anxious and on edge , just waiting for the other shoe to stop .\nNo good comes from panicking or solving problems before they are problems to solve so stop engaging with those worried thoughts .\nRedirect your mind onto something else or just tell yourself the opposite .\nIf you \u2019 re stressing about him losing interest , tell yourself : I am worthy and valuable and I will find the right person for me .\nThoughts are powerful forces and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much power to the bad ones !\n2 .\nDon \u2019 t try to win him over .\nTrying to win him over will just have the opposite effect , it will just make you come across as desperate and needy .\nStop plotting and strategizing and trying to be a certain way in order to get him to be a certain way .\nThis is exhausting and it will pummel your self-esteem .\nThe best part about being in a relationship is you can just be .\nYou can be your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress or worry and play detective .\nIf you feel like you have to work that hard to get someone \u2019 s attention , then they \u2019 re not the right person for you .\n3 .\nGive him the space to pursue you .\nLook , you can show interest in a guy , that \u2019 s not a bad thing .\nSomehow women are terrified of showing too much interest for fear they will scare a man away but if a guy really likes you \u2026 you showing interest in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isn \u2019 t going to work against you .\nSo show interest\u2026 but then leave it alone and let him pursue you .\nIf you do all the work , then you don \u2019 t leave any room for him to develop feelings for you .\nYou don \u2019 t need to micromanage your love life .\nThis is rooted in anxiety and in a lack of trust in yourself and in the fact that things will work out for you .\nAgain , it \u2019 s important to notice your thoughts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are truly coming from .\nI don \u2019 t care if you think you \u2019 ve found your soulmate or twin flame or whatever , do not invest until he has shown he is invested in you .\nThis means you keep yourself mentally open to the possibility of other guys and other outcomes .\nI see far too many women holding themselves hostage essentially in situations where a guy won \u2019 t prioritize her or commit in any real way\u2026but she stays and keeps investing in him because she \u2019 s decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one for her and her options are to either force this to work\u2026 or die alone .\nNow I hope you can see the foolery here , but it \u2019 s hard to see it when you \u2019 re in it .\nSo make sure you and he are on the same page before you get in too deep .\nYour time and mental energy are valuable resources , stop squandering them !\nStop obsessing and being desperate to hear from him .\nThis is a scarcity mindset , this makes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can get your hands on any scraps he has to spare .\nWhen you obsess and analyze , you \u2019 re essentially saying : I don \u2019 t trust that things are going to work out for me so I \u2019 m going to keep questioning everything until I prove myself right .\nSo change the mantra .\nWhen you catch yourself spiraling , just take a deep breath , put your

reasons\u2014obvious to women in relationships with other women .\nFor those not in the know , Cate Blanchett \u2019 s Oscar-nominated performance in 2015 \u2019 s lesbian period piece Carol solidified her status as a ( if not the ) queer icon , to the extent that her presence in the cast of Ocean \u2019 s 8 led to an inundation of internet video clips bent on documenting a case for an off-screen chemistry between her and Sandra Bullock .\nHowever entertaining said videos may have be , Blanchett has been married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without placing anyone in a box , it seems safe to rely on 25 years of precedence when assessing the probability of Blanchett and Bullock becoming Hollywood \u2019 s new \u201c it \u201d couple .\nAlthough , 2022 did bring us the nuptials of Bennifer , so to the delight of all the stans out there , the famous Dickensian proverb \u201c Never say never \u201d must apply .\nThe point is that Blanchett \u2019 s allure with the LGBTQ+ community exists independently from her own orientation .\nCasting her in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queer audiences into theaters the same way projecting a bat logo into the sky is a proven method for summoning Batman .\nThe choice then , to write Blanchett \u2019 s role as a lesbian and cast her alongside French actress No\u00e9mie Merlant , known for her breakout performance in 2019 \u2019 s lesbian period drama Portrait of a Young Lady on Fire , must have been intentional , if not calculated .\nOther films have attempted to crack this hypothetical formula for an award-winning LGBTQ+ film , usually a period piece\u20142020 \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the caliber of Kate Winslett and Saoirse Ronan was not enough to do the trick .\nIf there is anything to be considered problematic about the film ( and there is ) , I can \u2019 t necessarily pin it on this pairing .\nIf there is room in this commercial industry for a never-ending slew of superhero films to satisfy the Marvel-lovers of the world , then there must also be room for artsy films with award-winning actresses and gay storytelling .\nGive the people what they want .\nLet them spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those people .\nI spent my money .\nBut unfortunately , casting was the only one of these criteria that T\u00e1r fully delivered on and the performances themselves were the only thing holding it together .\nBlanchett and Merlant \u2019 s performances are foils to each other in the way that musical notation can not have a forte if there is no piano to compare it to .\nEverything about Blanchett \u2019 s Lydia T\u00e1r , from her tailored designer suits to the way she blackmails a school-girl in expat German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMerlant , as T\u00e1r \u2019 s assistant , Francesca , weaves a character made of glances and silences , inconspicuously gliding in and out of shots with the purpose , if not mandate , to not disturb her employer .\nThis dynamic between middle-aged celebrity and assistant is akin to yet another award-winning drama with lesbian undertones , 2014 \u2019 s Clouds of Sils Maria , but where Juliette Binoche and Kristen Stewart created a slow-burning sexual tension that fueled a poetic anti-climactic finale , T\u00e1r seems devoid of any true chemistry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desire in this film is one-sided .\nFrancesca longs for T\u00e1r \u2019 s approval and affection , as do the many others who surround her , but we don \u2019 t see any genuine interest returned , only the insinuation that it once was .\nFrancesca is perhaps the first of many inappropriate relationships T\u00e1r begins in professional settings .\nWhere they have remained on good terms , others like former student Krista Taylor , who is first painted as a potential stalker , represent the opposite extreme .\nKrista \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ostracism from the classical music community becomes the plot catalyst in a psychological thriller without a real horror scene .\nT\u00e1r lusts after her latest target conquest , Russian cellist Olga , the same way colleague Eliot lusts after her performance score , and both are met with thinly veiled dismissal .\nAs T\u00e1r \u2019 s wife Sharon comments in the film , the only relationship that isn \u2019 t transactional in this world exists between Lydia and her daughter Petra .\nHer only true passion is music .\nAt its core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things , T\u00e1r is a one-dimensional spin on a # MeToo film without an insightfully new point of view .\nIt is here that the choice of a lesbian protagonist becomes problematic .\nEven if we ignore the stereotype of lesbian as predator , the decision to only reverse the gender of sexual aggressor leaves us with women in a seemingly inescapable role as victims of harassment .\nThe choice also implies a test and a question : Will we as the audience be more lenient with T\u00e1r because she is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has society been too harsh on the men who have made headlines for similar behavior ?\nThe setting of this cultural examination within the world of classical music attempts to elevate the provocation beyond cancel culture to a philosophical level : Is the value of art unable to be tarnished by the sins of the artist ?\nCan T\u00e1r herself be considered a true artist ?\nWe hear Olga play a few notes from the song T\u00e1r claims to be composing for her daughter , but there is so little to listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the work of a Juilliard professor and internationally acclaimed conductor .\nSomeone who touts the epithet maestro .\nT\u00e1r \u2019 s true skills seem to be in interpreting not only music but the specific intentions of the composer while in the act of composing .\nWhile sharing her analysis of Mahler \u2019 s 5th Symphony , she claims to disagree with a mentor on the interpretation of the music , claiming the dedication to a new wife is evidence that the music illustrates a pure concept of love and not the complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was composed .\nWe never hear T\u00e1r record the last symphony in her series with the Berlin orchestra , as her professional and personal life unravels due to complications of her own .\nThe film is rich in such juxtapositions and symbolism , touches like a copy of Vita Sackville-West \u2019 s Challenge , maze drawings with an implied connection to Krista that appear in personal spaces belonging to T\u00e1r , Francesca \u2019 s title change to T\u00e1r \u2019 s autobiography T\u00e1r on T\u00e1r to Rat on Rat , paired with T\u00e1r \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a literal sewer , with her as the sewer rat .\nThese clues are strewn like breadcrumbs amidst a backdrop of beautiful cinematography , dialogue , acting , and sound design \u2014 everything you need to mentally masturbate for two hours and 38

has experienced the panic and uncertainty that occur when her man starts pulling away or withdrawing .\nMaybe it happens out of the blue , or maybe something sparks it , either way , it \u2019 s a miserable feeling , one that leaves you feeling powerless and painfully insecure .\nYou question what happened , why he \u2019 s doing this , and what you may have done to cause this sudden shift .\nThe most common questions I get on TikTok involve some variation of a guy suddenly backing off and the girl panicking over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it back on track .\nI totally get it , I \u2019 ve been there and I \u2019 m going to reveal exactly what you need to do when this happens to get things back on track .\nIt \u2019 s pretty widely known that when a man is stressed , he retreats to his \u201c man cave.\n\u201d There is a big difference between knowing something and really understanding it .\nMost women have a hard time accepting that this is how men deal with issues because when women are having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to talk about it and seek comfort from friends or loved ones .\nMost men don \u2019 t operate this way .\nWhen a man is having a hard time , he needs to pull back and work through his issues on his own .\nThe biggest mistake you can make is not giving him the space to do this .\nNow working through his issues doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean he \u2019 s sitting there , plotting and strategizing and brainstorming solutions .\nSometimes it means fully unplugging from the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes it means having mindless fun with his guy friends .\nIf you harp on him and pester him to talk to you and open up he will see you as another source of stress in his life and will pull away even more .\nThis creates a vicious cycle of you pushing him , him pulling back , you pushing more , and on and on until he either distances himself from you entirely or the relationship continues with an underlying tension .\nIf your guy is having a hard time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job or he \u2019 s having some internal emotional issue , you have to give him the space to work through it on his own .\nIf he wants to talk to you about it , he \u2019 ll seek you out .\nAnd if he does , make sure you listen to him , don \u2019 t use this as an opportunity to voice your opinions on the matter and try to solve it for him .\nIf he wants your advice , he \u2019 ll ask for it .\nThe best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support , let him know you \u2019 re there if he needs you , and then just back off at least for now .\n2 .\nYou \u2019 re Being Needy And He Feels Suffocated A man doesn \u2019 t have to be dealing with personal issues to feel the need to retreat .\nSometimes too much neediness from you is enough to cause him to back away .\nNeediness isn \u2019 t so much a set of behaviors as it is a state of mind .\nIf a man feels like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your life , or that you need him to fill some sort of emotional void for you , he will instinctively pull back .\nThat \u2019 s just a human response whenever someone wants something from us .\nMen want to feel wanted and desired , not needed .\nThis is a very important distinction that most women overlook .\nThis is how it looks .\nWe \u2019 re going to take a situation and see how a needy and non-needy woman responds to it .\nLet \u2019 s say a guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t had time to text his partner .\nA non-needy woman might send him a text just because she \u2019 s thinking about him and wants to let him know .\nMaybe she misses him , maybe she knows he \u2019 s under a lot of pressure and wants to show her support .\nShe texts him and he doesn \u2019 t reply but she \u2019 s unbothered and assumes he \u2019 s really busy and he \u2019 ll get back to her later .\nNow let \u2019 s take the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more needy place .\nShe takes his lack of texting as a sign he \u2019 s losing interest .\nShe starts to panic and immediately texts him .\nNow it doesn \u2019 t matter what she says in this text , she may say the same thing the non-needy woman said , what matters is the intention behind it .\nShe isn \u2019 t texting to show she cares or to offer her support\u2026 she \u2019 s texting because she wants to know how he feels .\nShe wants the assurance that everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still on track .\nIf she hears back from him , she feels relieved\u2026 for now .\nIf she doesn \u2019 t , she spends the entire day spiraling and imagining the worst-case scenarios .\nMen do enjoy being in relationships ( when it \u2019 s with the right woman , that is ) , but at the same time , most men have a huge fear of getting trapped in a situation with a woman who sucks them dry and leaves them feeling drained and uninspired .\nLife is hard enough\u2026 who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that makes everything harder ?\nWho willingly wants to add stress to their lives ?\nWhen you have a lot going on in your life and are already happy and fulfilled , he will see the relationship as a source of joy and inspiration and this will draw him in .\n3 .\nHe \u2019 s Having Doubts About The Relationship Doubts are normal , especially as a relationship deepens .\nIt doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean anything about you or how great of a girlfriend you \u2019 ve been .\nMaybe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious , or maybe he \u2019 s a little unsure if you \u2019 re really the woman he sees himself spending the rest of his life with .\nAnd that \u2019 s OK. Two people can love each other very much and still not be right for each other in the long run .\nMaybe something happened to spark these doubts ( a fight , jealousy , lack of trust , etc . )\nor maybe it happened out of the blue .\nDon \u2019 t waste your time analyzing the situation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will only make you crazy .\nInstead , give him space and just focus on yourself for now because that \u2019 s really all you can do .\nYou can \u2019 t force him to feel a certain way about you , you can \u2019 t force him to want the kind of relationship you want , so spending time and energy on how to change his behavior or how he feels is a waste .\nThat time is much better spent investing in yourself and being your best self .\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBoth at life and in

within yourself and at your actions and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming from and how you \u2019 re showing up in the relationship .\nWhy is he acting distant after hooking up all of the sudden ?\nDid I sleep with him too soon ?\nIt \u2019 s possible that this is rooted in your own insecurity .\nMaybe you have a belief that men will lose interest after sex and so now you \u2019 re hyper-vigilant and on alert for that to come true .\nIt \u2019 s also possible he \u2019 s acting distant because he wants to slow the pace a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean much to most men .\nFor a man , sex is sex and love is love and one doesn \u2019 t lead to the other .\nSome women see sex as a deepening of the relationship .\nIf a man has had experiences with women like this in the past , he may reflexively pull away just

"content": "Will sleeping with a guy too soon make him instantly lose interest and head for the hills ?\nIt is an age-old debate with no concrete answer .\nI have been writing about relationships and coaching women for over a decade and I can \u2019 t even tell you how many messages I receive from women panicked over the fact that they slept with a guy too soon and now he \u2019 s acting a little weird and what if he \u2019 s gone forever ?\nThe good news is that unless he \u2019 s some sort of pickup artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man will not lose interest solely because you slept with him too soon .\nHowever , this topic isn \u2019 t quite so simple , so let me break it down .\nA close friend of mine recently met an amazing guy on an online dating site .\nHe was smart , successful , and a dead-ringer for Bradley Cooper .\nThings got off to a promising start .\nThey exchanged a few flirty messages and he asked her to go out that Saturday night .\nThey had an amazing time on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he asked her out for the following Saturday early in the week .\nAnother nice date with pleasant conversation and enjoying each other \u2019 s company ( and some passionate making out ) and he again reserved her for the following Saturday night .\nBefore the date , she told me she was a little unsure about this guy .\nShe thought he was great on paper and all , but she didn \u2019 t really feel like they had much to talk about ; she mostly just thought he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to sleep with him after their third date , and I didn \u2019 t really offer much in the way of advice since it didn \u2019 t seem like she was interested in having a real relationship with him anyway .\nSo they had a passionate night together and continued to text one another in the days that followed , but something had shifted \u2026 My friend told me that she was waiting for him to ask her out for that Saturday night because she had purchased tickets to a booze cruise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date .\nHe usually asked her out for Saturday night no later than Wednesday , and when he still hadn \u2019 t asked her out by Thursday , she started to panic .\nThey were still in contact ; he would still text her messages full of sexual innuendoes .\nBut sometimes he didn \u2019 t text , or would just drop off when she asked him about something non-sex related .\nSuddenly , their relationship went from elegant Saturday night dates to random 2 AM hookups .\nHe never texted her earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nice and sweet and all that when they hung out , all he wanted was to fool around ( and sometimes order in food and fool around ) .\nI stood silently as the whole thing started to unravel .\nI make it a policy not to give my friends relationship advice unless they explicitly ask for it ( and a lot of the time they won \u2019 t because they know I \u2019 ll hit them with the truth and they would rather stay in denial ! )\n.\nAlso , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for not giving them the answers they want , so in order to keep the peace , I will stay mum until things get dire .\nAnd when they did , my friend finally called me up and said , \u201c I don \u2019 t get this .\nI really , really like him .\nWhat did I do wrong ?\n\u201d I first pointed out the fact that she didn \u2019 t start really , really liking him until he stopped acting that way toward her .\nBut even still , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him too soon .\nIt was a pretty open-and-shut case , probably one of the easiest relationship questions brought to me .\n\u201c What do you mean ?\n\u201d she countered .\n\u201c I waited until the third date !\nIsn \u2019 t that what you \u2019 re supposed to do ?\n\u201d I tried to stifle my laughter at the absurdity of her statement .\n\u201c Okay , well , tell me this .\nWhat did you actually know about this guy ?\nWhat do you know about him that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online dating profile or social media pages ?\n\u201d \u201c Ummm\u2026 Well , he would show me pictures of his nieces and nephews and talk about them !\n\u201d \u201c Doesn \u2019 t count .\nAnyone on Facebook or Instagram could see the pictures , and I \u2019 m sure he talks about them to his friends and co-workers .\nDo you know what his ultimate goals are ?\nHis fears ?\nWhat makes him happy ?\nWhat his weak points are ?\n\u201d And therein lies the problem .\nShe slept with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real connection .\nThey were still in the casual getting-to-know-one-another phase .\nHe hadn \u2019 t shown any level of investment ( I know going on three Saturday night dates in a row with a guy can feel like he \u2019 s investing , but it \u2019 s not so ) .\nThey didn \u2019 t really know each other ; all they knew were the superficial details that anyone else can be privy to .\nWhen it comes to sleeping with a guy , the quantity of dates is an arbitrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhat matters is the quality of the time you spend together .\nA girl who sleeps with a guy on the first date after an evening of intense , meaningful conversation that fosters a bond is much more likely to have a lasting relationship than a girl who sleeps with a guy she hasn \u2019 t really formed a connection with on the fifth date .\nThe guy my friend was dating never really invested in her .\nYeah , he was attracted and somewhat interested , but after sex was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuing things further .\nWhy should he take her out on nice dates and wine her and dine her when he can call her at 1 a.m. when he \u2019 s feeling horny and get his needs met ?\nWhen sex comes before a real emotional connection has been established , it \u2019 s hard to rewind the clock .\nFor men , sex is sex and love is love .\nAnd one does not lead to the other .\nA lot of women make the mistake of thinking sex is some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s not how most men see it .\nMy friend didn \u2019 t really start to catch feelings until the guy \u2019 s interest began to wane .\nThis is another common phenomenon I see frequently and there are a few reasons for it .\nIf we \u2019 re going to talk about it from a scientific point of view .\nI \u2019 m sure you \u2019 ve heard of Oxytocin , AKA the \u201c love hormone.\n\u201d It is basically released during any moment of physical touch , so the more intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel to that person .\nNext , there is the universal human phenomenon of wanting what we can \u2019 t have .\nAs soon as he started losing interest in her , she saw him as being inherently more valuable and started to invest even more ( and there are psychological reasons behind this which we can discuss in a different article ! )\n.\nThe right time to sleep with a guy is when he has shown a level of investment in you .\n( This is assuming you want a relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend with benefits or a steady booty call , then sleep with him whenever you want \u2013 just be safe ! )\nThis doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean he calls you his girlfriend or has said he loves you .\nIt means you both are able to drop your masks and be real when you \u2019 re together .\nIt means he shares things with you he doesn \u2019 t share with other people in his life ( and vice versa ) .\nIt means he cares about you and respects you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ve been told all our lives that we need to make a guy wait for sex , like it \u2019 s some bargaining chip to dangle in front of him in order to get what we want out of him .\nI get where the idea comes from , and there is a grain of truth in there , but it doesn \u2019 t get to the heart of the matter and leaves too much room for interpretation .\nMost women take it to mean that the longer she holds out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he \u2019 ll chase her and the more invested he \u2019 ll become .\nMaybe this can work , but usually , it doesn \u2019 t and the guy will see right through what you \u2019 re trying to pull .\nThe issue isn \u2019 t how long you wait \u2013 a guy who really likes you won \u2019 t hold it against you if you sleep with him early on .\nThe issue is that men don \u2019 t value what they perceive is readily and easily available to all other men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you really know him , it \u2019 s easy for him to assume that any other guy could have done it .\nWhen you sleep with him after getting to know who he truly is , he believes that you slept with him because of how amazing he is and that you wouldn \u2019 t have given in so easily if it were any other guy .\nSee the distinction ?\nAs for my friend , I tried helping her get back on track but their relationship had sunk too deep into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t be resuscitated .\nShe tried to not see him unless it was on a date ( and he found ways to dodge that and was only free when he could come over for sex and was always too busy when she suggested an activity ) , she didn \u2019 t reply to his sexts , and she tried to learn more about him , but nothing worked and eventually he just faded away into the abyss .\nHow long should you wait to sleep with someone ?\nIf you want a relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has shown he is invested in you and genuinely cares about you .\nRemember , the quantity of dates is meaningless , it \u2019 s the quality of the time spent together that matters .\nOn average , how many dates do people go on before they sleep together ?\nThat really depends , but not very many !\nDo guys lose respect if you sleep with them ?\nNo , I wouldn \u2019 t say they lose respect per se .\nThey may lose interest , but usually a guy who loses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that interested in the first place .\nMaybe he liked you\u2026 but didn \u2019 t like you enough .\nIt all really comes down to your intention .\nIf you sleep with him in order to get him to like you , yes , he may lose respect for you because that \u2019 s a degrading thing to do .\nWhat does he think after you sleep with him ?\nAgain , it depends on circumstances .\nIf it \u2019 s a guy who really likes you , he \u2019 ll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy who likes you but isn \u2019 t totally ready for a serious relationship\u2026 he may pump the breaks a little bit to keep things moving at a more leisurely pace .\nIf he was only attracted to you but not super interested in you\u2026 he may feel worried you \u2019 re going to get too attached .\nBut no man , at least no emotionally healthy man , will feel repulsed by a woman for the mere fact that she slept with him .\nWhat signs might he show if he regrets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid you , withdraw , act cold toward you , or flat out ghost you .\nWe \u2019 re not exclusive or official yet , but I know he slept with someone else .\nWhat should I do with this information ?\nYou need to get clear on what you want .\nIf you want an exclusive relationship and the fact that he slept with someone else feels devastating to you , talk to him about it .\nIf he wants to keep things open and you just can \u2019 t handle it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right man for you .", "author": "Sabrina Bendory", "url":

.\nNow some people have the upper hand because they are naturally charismatic which easily crosses over to being a skilled flirter ( these people are usually Libras , just saying ! )\n.\nFor others , it doesn \u2019 t come as naturally , but flirting is a skill you can learn .\nBeing a good flirt doesn \u2019 t just make men more attracted to you , it also gives you the skills to be more charming and likable overall which can help in all areas of your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masterful flirt : First and foremost , remember that flirting is supposed to be fun .\nDon \u2019 t be all in your head about it , overthinking never brings any good to a situation .\nDon \u2019 t analyze whether he \u2019 s being receptive to your flirting\u2026 if he \u2019 s going to ask you out\u2026 if he \u2019 s feeling it too\u2026 if you \u2019 re doing too much or not enough\u2026 make an effort to quiet all that inner chatter and just be in the moment and enjoy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because who really gives them any ?\nIt \u2019 s not like a guy posts pictures of himself on social media and his friends are all leaving fire emojis .\nNotice things about him and compliment him , it goes a long way .\nObviously , you should be mindful not to lay it on too thick , that just comes across as disingenuous and borders on desperate because it seems like you \u2019 re just complimenting him to get him to like you .\nBeing a good flirt is about giving just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you pay him a compliment , and it makes him want to impress you even more so he can hear more compliments .\nAnd a good compliment is really in the delivery , say it with confidence !\nLook him in the eye , don \u2019 t be shifty and mumbly and awkward about it .\nAn important thing to understand about men , in general , is that they universally crave appreciation .\nHe wants to be seen and appreciated for who he is .\nIf you can do that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and want to take things further .\nYou do not need to be some cold , aloof ice queen to rouse a guy \u2019 s interest .\nQuite the opposite !\nThere is nothing more disarming than a warm , genuine smile .\nI said genuine .\nA genuine smile illuminates and radiates an infectious , positive vibe .\nBeing able to smile freely will come if you \u2019 re able to be at ease and just enjoy the moment , as mentioned in the first point .\nIt \u2019 s also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confidence within yourself .\nWhen you do , you will effortlessly draw people in .\n4 .\nUse his name in conversation I went on a first date with an incredibly charming man many moons ago .\nI was captivated by him from the start but throughout the date , he kept using my name- \u201c So what do you like to do for fun , Sabrina ?\n\u201d And every time he did I felt like I was being shocked with electricity .\nIt was just so disarming and sexy !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous bestselling book How to Win Friends and Influence People said , \u201c A person \u2019 s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.\n\u201d So if you want to make an impression on someone , and this doesn \u2019 t just apply to romantic relationships , use their name !\nAgain , this goes back to the concept of leaving him wanting more .\nNothing drives a man wild like a subtle , \u201c accidental \u201d touch .\nMaybe you \u2019 re sitting next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you leave yours there instead of reflexively pulling away .\nMaybe it \u2019 s a high five that lingers a little too long , bordering on hand-holding .\nMaybe you give his shoulder a gentle squeeze after he tells a funny story .\nWhatever you do , just keep it subtle and sparse , no draping yourself all over him .\nIf he \u2019 s interested , he will take it to the next level .\nAs they say\u2026 eyes are the windows of the soul .\nMaking eye contact creates a feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flirting is about being subtle .\nSo don \u2019 t keep your eyes fixed and focused on him , that \u2019 s just too intense .\nJust be engaged when he \u2019 s talking to you , and then take breaks and let your gaze wander .\nIt can be nerve-racking talking to a guy you like and some women get a little fidgety and their eyes may dart all over the place so just have an awareness of that and try to get a handle on that nervous energy , otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not interested or bored .\nBeing interesting and seductive isn \u2019 t about showing off how great you are\u2026 it comes from showing genuine interest in the other person .\nAsk questions , really listen for the answers instead of waiting for your turn to speak , take a genuine interest in him and his life and what he \u2019 s about .\nThis is the real art of seduction !\nHere is another classic line from Dale Carnegie : \u201c You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years by trying to get other people interested in you.\n\u201d So much of communication is nonverbal .\nPay attention to your stance and your posture .\nIf you \u2019 re stiff and rigid , you come across as insecure or he may think you \u2019 re not interested .\nKeep you \u2019 re chin up , and stand tall with an open posture , this conveys confidence and confidence is sexy .\nWe touched on this a little throughout this article but it deserves its own category .\nLeave him wanting more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun .\nThat \u2019 s what gets him thinking about you and wanting you more .\nDon \u2019 t tell him you \u2019 re whole life story , this goes for in-person and over text .\nThink of yourself like an onion , let him peel back the layers one at a time .\nIt \u2019 s also important to leave him wondering whether you \u2019 re flirting or not so he could interpret your actions either way .\nThis is what will really drive him wild and get his wheels turning into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human mind into a tizzy like not knowing where we stand with someone .\nYou can play everything right , but if you don \u2019 t feel comfortable and confident within yourself , it won \u2019 t have the right impact .\nSo that \u2019 s always where to focus .\nYou have to let go of the fears of rejection and you \u2019 re insecurities .\nTrust that you are hot and sexy and likable and that the right guy will see it and if this guy isn \u2019 t receptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just not right for you .\nIt \u2019 s not what you say or do , it \u2019 s the intention behind what you say or do that makes a difference , so focus on being comfortable with yourself and everything else will just fall into place effortlessly .", "author": "Sabrina

want ?\nMaybe you feel frustrated by this , you want to find love\u2026 and yet , you can \u2019 t summon even a flicker of attraction for the guys who are available and seem really interested in you .\nMaybe you think the heart wants what it wants\u2026 and you can \u2019 t help who you are drawn to .\nMaybe you \u2019 re aware that you only seem attracted to emotionally unavailable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why or how to fix it .\nWell , you \u2019 ve landed in the right place .\nI \u2019 m going to explain exactly why you \u2019 re drawn to emotionally unavailable men and how to break the pattern .\nBuckle up , we \u2019 re going deep with this one !\nFirst , let \u2019 s look at why\u2026 There is no greater way to hide from yourself than in someone else \u2019 s problems .\nAnd emotionally unavailable men usually have a lot of them !\nThey are unavailable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be a divorce , the death of a loved one , a traumatic breakup , or childhood .\nOr maybe he just doesn \u2019 t want to commit to anyone until his life is in order .\nMaybe he \u2019 s having financial issues or emotional issues .\nAnd most men won \u2019 t want to be \u201c seen \u201d when they are off their game like this .\nIt \u2019 s so easy to get lost in him and his issues and what \u2019 s going on with his life .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ on yourself , you can put off dealing with yourself and what \u2019 s going on in your life and devote yourself to getting him back not rack .\nMaybe he \u2019 s not just emotionally unavailable , but he \u2019 s actually unavailable , as in married .\nNow , this is a great place to hide because you \u2019 ve created a whole drama for yourself .\nThere \u2019 s suspense , there is so much unknown , there is sneaking around , there are high stakes\u2026 it \u2019 s like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie and you get to hopefully be the triumphant heroine and persevere and get the guy !\n2 .\nPlaying savior makes you feel good about yourself .\nIf you lack self-esteem then trying to save this man from himself can give you a feeling of purpose and meaning .\nHe needs you .\nAnd it can be nice to feel needed .\nThis is the trap of codependent relationships , the weak person needs the strong so much they almost can \u2019 t function without them\u2026 and the strong person is addicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s the thing with emotionally unavailable men\u2026 they do still also enjoy the closeness and connection of having someone there even if they won \u2019 t or can \u2019 t commit .\nThis gives you just enough rope to hang onto .\nYou may also think that by saving him , you \u2019 re almost buying his love and loyalty .\nI see this happen all the time .\nI see women left shattered and devastated when their emotionally unavailable guy leaves for good .\nShe doesn \u2019 t understand .\nHow can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did everything for him !\nI helped him !\nI healed him !\nAnd then he left me ?\n!\nIt \u2019 s not right , it \u2019 s not fair .\nYou feel connected to his darkness .\nA lot of the time , we are drawn to someone who is lost and alone because we also feel lost and alone , we feel connected to his trauma and his darkness .\nAnd there is a comfort in the familiarity , in what feels like home\u2026 even if that home is totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt may not even be him that you want , it \u2019 s a feeling of being seen and accepted for who you truly are .\n4 .\nYou are also emotionally unavailable .\nHere is a key relationship concept : Like attracts like .\nAn emotionally healthy person will attract another emotionally healthy person .\nAn emotionally unavailable person will attract another emotionally unavailable person .\nNow you might be thinking : What are you talking about , Sabrina ?\nI \u2019 m not emotionally unavailable , I \u2019 m dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 re consistently going for guys who are emotionally unavailable and won \u2019 t commit , it \u2019 s probably because deep down you don \u2019 t believe you are worthy of love , and this probably stems back to your childhood as most issues in our adult lives do !\nYou may be going for guys who won \u2019 t commit to you because deep down you feel unworthy of love and these guys simply validate the way you already feel about yourself .\nThe subconscious mind is always looking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be desperate for a relationship , you \u2019 re setting yourself up to fail by going for guys who can \u2019 t give you what .\n5 .\nYou \u2019 re using him as validation .\nMaybe you think you \u2019 ll gain self-esteem by winning this guy over and getting him to commit .\nYou erroneously believe that all you need to do is get him to commit and then you \u2019 ll finally be happy and whole and healed and you \u2019 ll finally feel worthy and all those insecurities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet paper stuck to your shoe will evaporate .\nThis is just a trap , this is another distraction , it \u2019 s a way of avoiding doing the work necessary to actually build self-esteem .\nInstead , you think , OK , I just need to focus on winning him over and then I \u2019 ll be golden !\nNow that we \u2019 ve discussed why it happens , let \u2019 s look at some solutions to break the cycle .\nYou need to examine why you \u2019 re drawn to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because there is something in it for you \u2026 you wouldn \u2019 t be there otherwise .\nIt \u2019 s filling a void or scratching an itch .\nMaybe it \u2019 s touching on old wounds and traumas .\nFigure out what it is exactly .\nSometimes that can be all it takes for those knots to start loosening and for you to break free of this destructive pattern .\nIf deep down you don \u2019 t believe you \u2019 re worthy of love so you are drawn to people who validate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !\nTake care of yourself , really good care .\nWhen you do this , you are sending the message to yourself that you are valuable and worthy- you can \u2019 t really expect other people to treat you well if you don \u2019 t treat yourself so nicely !\nEat well , exercise , go outside , nourish yourself , create a relaxing morning or evening routine , and get on a good supplement regimen .\nIt \u2019 s not just about the physical , it \u2019 s also about nourishing your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive books and podcasts .\nSurround yourself with positive people .\nCreate an environment that elevates you , not one that brings you down or keeps you stuck .\n3 .\nGet to know yourself .\nHow can you love or even like yourself when you don \u2019 t know yourself ?\nAnd trust me , most people don \u2019 t know themselves as well as they think .\nTake some time and visualize your ideal day , think of it from start to finish : What time do you wake up ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you go ?\nWhat do you do ?\nWho do you spend time with ?\nNow try to incorporate some of those elements into your daily life .\nWhen you map it out in your mind , you may realize that you aren \u2019 t living your life in a way that reaps the most joy and fulfillment .\nYou also need to make an effort to tap into that thing that makes you feel alive .\nWe all have that thing .\nThe thing that reminds us why we \u2019 ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of that thing .\nI hate to break it to you , but time doesn \u2019 t heal all wounds .\nTime makes memories foggy , but that pain will still be there and will remain there until you confront it .\nIf you ignore it , it will get activated at the most unlikely times , suddenly ripping through you .\nMaybe you have an extreme emotional reaction to something minor , maybe you suddenly feel flushed and break out in hives , maybe you feel inexplicably anxious by something innocuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI know it \u2019 s scary to face .\nYou feel like you \u2019 re just going to fall into some great black hole and never claw your way out .\nAnd it will be tough , but it will be endlessly rewarding so you have to go there .\nSome people can deal with it on their own with some job books or through journaling or meditation .\nOthers may need a coach or therapist or a hypnotist or a shaman , there is so much out there these days so @ @ @ @ @ @", "author": "Sabrina Bendory", "url":

When A Man Pulls Away", "content": "When a man starts pulling away or withdrawing or acting cold toward you\u2026 it \u2019 s hard not to panic .\nIt \u2019 s hard not to blame yourself : What did I do ?\nIs it something I said ?\nWas I too needy ?\nIs he losing interest ?\nYou reflexively start to panic and start questioning yourself and your value .\nAm I just not good enough for him ?\nIt feels like he has complete control over the relationship\u2026 you \u2019 re just along for the ride , waiting to be chosen .\nYou feel powerless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit .\nSo let \u2019 s talk about how to not let that happen !\nThis first step sounds so simple but it \u2019 s so hard to actually follow through on .\nThe fact is , when a man pulls away it usually has nothing to do with you .\nHe \u2019 s usually grappling with some sort of internal issue and when you take it personally then it suddenly becomes a relationship issue .\nThe best thing you can do is gracefully step back and give him the space to realign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel resistance to this idea , our instinct is to move toward that which we want , not away from it !\nThere is also an underlying fear that he \u2019 ll forget about her as soon as she \u2019 s not a strong presence .\nNow let \u2019 s look at that for a minute .\nLook at the insecurities that fuel such an irrational fear .\nIf you truly believe that a guy who you are in a relationship with would simply forget about you because you \u2019 re not right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little while , then you need to consider why you think you are so forgettable .\nInstead of worrying about why he \u2019 s pulling away , ask yourself : Why does this bother me so much ?\nWhat is the real fear here ?\nI can \u2019 t say this enough , the constant stressing ruins everything .\nYou really have to get your mind and fearful thoughts under control here .\nHere is what I want you to do when those anxious thoughts start bubbling up .\nFirst , notice the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then ask yourself : does this thought serve me well ?\nIf it \u2019 s bringing up feelings of fear , anxiety , insecurity , and so on , then the answer is no !\nNo , it \u2019 s not serving you well .\nSo stop engaging with the thought .\nI also love Mel Robbins \u2019 technique for handling anxious thoughts .\nWhen you \u2019 re in the throes of a spiral , just count backward from 5 to 1 .\nThen reframe and shift the thought to a positive one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out just fine ?\n\u201d and envision things working out the way you want .\nMaybe you picture how you want the relationship to be , or maybe you just envision yourself being confident and calm .\nOr maybe you just shift your mind to focus on something totally unrelated , like an exciting project you \u2019 re working on or trip you have planned .\nThe purpose is to just get out of that .\nfrenzied , panicked place ( because no good can ever come of it ! )\n, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt is so empowering to just realize that you \u2019 re not in control of everything and that the sky is not going to cave in because you \u2019 re not personally holding it up .\nIt \u2019 s incredibly freeing to know that you will be OK no matter what .\nJust drop all the digging , analyzing , and strategizing on how to fix this problem , which , I need to point out , isn \u2019 t even a real problem yet !\nI 100 % get the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feeling that you can control the situation somehow and fix everything .\nBut trying to fix a problem by obsessing over it is like running on a treadmill expecting to end up in a new city .\nYou \u2019 re expending tons of energy , but you \u2019 re still in the same spot !\nIt \u2019 s natural for your brain to want to latch on to a mystery and solve it , discovering the answers so you can stop wondering , worrying , and waiting .\nThe fact is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , over his life , or the circumstances he \u2019 s in .\nAll you can control is yourself and your reactions .\nSo stop trying to control the outcome , focus on controlling your reactions .\nAt this point , if you \u2019 re feeling stressed out and miserable because your guy is pulling away and the only way you \u2019 ll feel happy again is if he comes back , then you \u2019 re attaching way too much to him and the relationship .\nThis is a habit that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re relying on someone else other than yourself to make you feel happy , complete , and whole .\nInstead of placing a condition on your happiness , that you will only feel that way if he comes back , ask yourself what are some other ways you can increase your own happiness that don \u2019 t rely on someone else behaving a certain way .\nAsk yourself : how can I feed my happiness tank today ?\nBecause that \u2019 s what happiness is- it is a jar that constantly needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just a static state of being .\nHappiness is a choice , it \u2019 s a choice you make every day that is comprised of a multitude of mini-choices you make throughout the day .\nAnd it definitely does not come from waiting around for a man to choose you or give you some attention .\nHigh-value women rely on themselves to be happy and to feel good , they don \u2019 t outsource the task to others .\nHigh-value women do not stick around in situations or with people who don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them .\nWith that said , when a guy pulls away it \u2019 s very likely that he \u2019 s just dealing with some personal issues in his own time and space .\nI think you should give him a bit of grace and understanding but giving him space can not go on indefinitely with no end in sight .\nYou can \u2019 t just be waiting in the wings , he needs to show up in the relationship again at some point .\nSo first give him some space .\nIf you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shoot him a friendly text saying , \u201c Hey , just wanted to see how you \u2019 re doing .\nHope all is well.\n\u201d or something similar and casual .\nSee what comes back your way .\nIf you don \u2019 t get any response then it \u2019 s time to realize that no response is also a response and maybe this relationship has reached the end of the road .\nIf he does reply but it \u2019 s cold or short , then it might be time to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your relationship and with him .\nIf he ignores you and this was a guy you were only casually seeing or it \u2019 s in the very early stages of dating , then it \u2019 s safe to assume he \u2019 s not just pulling away but he \u2019 s most likely ghosting and you should move on .\nIf you \u2019 re in a committed relationship and he \u2019 s pulling away , he \u2019 s most likely dealing with things that have nothing to do with you .\nLet him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs you , and if the pattern continues , then you \u2019 ll need to let him know that the relationship can \u2019 t continue this way and you and he need to make a plan for how to get things back on track .\nIf he doesn \u2019 t want to\u2026 well , then you may want to consider why you want to keep investing in someone who no longer wants to invest in you .\nBeing high-value is about knowing your worth and setting the standard , and then it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard !\nBe a chooser , not a chaser .\nA chaser chases after the relationship , fearing she won \u2019 t find anything better .\nA chooser knows she has the power of choice .\nIf a man doesn \u2019 t treat her right , she will not linger in the relationship and will just move on .", "author": "Sabrina Bendory", "url":

away , but this is ridiculous !\nIf a guy likes you , then your showing interest in him will be seen as a good thing .\nOnly an insecure man with a weak ego would be put off by such a thing .\nI think this idea gained traction because it is true that men are put off by neediness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a set of behaviors , the state of mind is one that says , \u201c I need you in order to feel OK .\nI need you to validate me otherwise I will suffer.\n\u201d It is also off-putting to show so much interest and be so invested in a guy you barely know .\nWhen you do this , it \u2019 s usually coming from an unhealthy place , a place of you attaching something to him .\nMaybe you see him as a chance to finally have a boyfriend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him as a chance to feel better about yourself , maybe you see him as the chance to save you from something , to heal you , to ease your loneliness or pain .\nSo yes , this is where being overzealous with your interest can be a bad thing , but if you are showing interest in him because you are genuinely interested in him \u2026 and he is interested in you \u2026 then your interest will make him feel like the luckiest man alive !\n4 .\nIf a guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe whole \u201c does he like me ?\n\u201d question gets confusing because it \u2019 s not so cut and dry .\nIf he was straight up ignoring you or rejecting you , then yes , it \u2019 s clear he \u2019 s not interested .\nBut sometimes a guy can seem super interested one day , and then show zero interest the next\u2026 a behavior often known as sending \u201c mixed messages \u201d or being \u201c hot and cold.\n\u201d It \u2019 s confusing because he does like you a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delusional\u2026 he just doesn \u2019 t like you enough .\nMixed messages are usually one clear message : he \u2019 s unsure of you .\nWhen a guy likes you , he will be consistent .\nHe will consistently call or text , there will be consistency in how often you see each other .\nAnd there will also be an escalation .\nYou won \u2019 t be stagnant .\nYou won \u2019 t be hitting a new relationship milestone every day because that \u2019 s not realistic , but you won \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things just being stagnant , where you \u2019 re stuck in the \u201c talking phase \u201d or \u201c situationship \u201d phase with no way out .\n5 .\nIf a guy likes you\u2026 you just need to exist .\nYou don \u2019 t need to plot or plan or strategize or craft the perfect text .\nYou don \u2019 t need to stage casual \u201c accidental \u201d run-ins .\nYou don \u2019 t need your friends to talk to his friends .\nYou don \u2019 t need to go digging through his social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his story is- who is he following ?\nWho follows him ?\nWhat posts does he like ?\nWho \u2019 s liking his stuff ?\nStop working so hard , you don \u2019 t need to do anything to get him to like you .\nJust exist .\nExist and show some interest in him so he \u2019 s not afraid of rejection- all that requires is warmth and a genuine smile .\nIf you have to pull out all the stops and all the tricks to get him to notice you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you !\nThe right guy for you wants to be with you and makes this

share the story of how I married my high-school ex-boyfriend after 11 years of me wanting him and him not being interested in me at all !\nI \u2019 m not super comfortable being so open and vulnerable ( I \u2019 m an Aquarius , after all ! )\n, but I know my story will resonate with most of you and it will help and inspire you so I \u2019 m going out on an emotional limb even though it terrifies me a little .\nThe reason it \u2019 s taken me so long to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t tell it in a vacuum .\nIn order to fully understand how I was finally able to have a healthy , stable relationship for pretty much the first time in my life , you need to know a little more about me and my past relationships .\nSo growing up I wouldn \u2019 t say I was \u201c unattractive \u201d but for whatever reason , I was an \u201c undesirable.\n\u201d I realized it around my tween years , so maybe like age 10 when boys and girls started really taking notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted .\nI can \u2019 t totally put my finger on what it was , maybe because I was always so much taller than the other girls ?\nAt the time I felt like a big fat hideous monster , but when I look back at pictures of myself during that time I wasn \u2019 t at all !\nI was actually really cute , but I got annihilated for my appearance , especially by boys .\nI was in the popular clique- so my best friends were the prettiest ones who all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always the second fiddle .\nI wasn \u2019 t a threat to anyone because I was so undesirable , I was just the supportive friend who was there to listen to all the boy drama they were experiencing .\nMy best friend was the queen bee of the group and it was really sad because anytime I would have a crush on a guy , it would turn out he was desperately in love with her .\nAnd this happened every time .\nI got made fun of a lot , I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasn \u2019 t .\nI felt horrible about myself and that led to a lot of self-loathing .\nI developed an eating disorder at age 12 and it was on and off until 17 .\nWhen I was 17 , it got really bad and I was hospitalized for a month .\nWhen I got out of the hospital , I was healthy for the first time in many years\u2026 and all of a sudden I was getting all this male attention , and it felt surreal .\nIt started slowly .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nUp until that point I had so much shame around my lack of desirability .\nI felt invisible , and when I wasn \u2019 t invisible , I just felt like I was too much , too grotesque .\nI got out of the hospital at the end of March and I met my husband in mid-June at a party .\nI gave you this background because our childhood basically sets the foundation for our adult relationships , so this part will explain a lot of what came later .\nOK , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my junior year of high school and I \u2019 m at a party and meet the man who would become my husband .\nWe meet , we talked , we flirted , we kissed .\nAnd I was flying .\nI remember feeling this electricity running through my body , nothing I \u2019 d ever felt before .\nHe got my number and I was ecstatic- in my mind it meant we were going to be boyfriend/girlfriend because that \u2019 s how it always goes in the movies\u2026 but he never called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and really confused but I was also very distracted by the copious amount of men who all of a sudden did want me .\nI \u2019 m telling you this just to illustrate how confusing and absurd my life was- I had no idea who I was or what the world thought of me because for my whole life I was told one thing , and now suddenly I was being told another .\nAnd I had no sense of self to fall back on- I was letting everyone else tell me who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI felt like it wasn \u2019 t real , like I was in some sort of dream .\nBut I loved the attention .\nI also didn \u2019 t know how to handle it .\nI was on this endless hamster wheel just desperate for validation , and no matter how much I got , I desperately needed more more more .\nMy good friend \u2019 s boyfriend \u2019 s mom was a caterer and she was looking for some waiters to help out with events on weekends .\nMy friend asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I didn \u2019 t at all , but then she told me the other guys who were going to be doing it and the boy from the party happened to be one of them , so I was like : Sign me up !\nMy plan was simple- look really hot and ignore him and make him rue the day he decided to get my number and never call me .\nAnd I really handled it perfectly .\nI looked amazing , and he saw me walking over to put napkins on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me intensely , and he walks up to me and said , \u201c Hey , how \u2019 s it going ?\n\u201d And I casually glance in his direction and say , \u201c Good \u201d with a sweet little smile , and then I walk away .\nIt didn \u2019 t take long for him to actually utilize the phone number that he had added to his contacts so many months ago and we were talking and texting ( and of course , talking on AIM , this was the early aughts !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ older so he was a freshman in college but his college was 45 minutes away so we were able to see each other .\nAnd I fell for him , HARD .\nAt this point , there were guys who desired me , but none of them knew me .\nHaving someone who actually , genuinely seemed to care about me was just so unbelievable .\nAnd I honestly think I really loved him , although I know he didn \u2019 t feel that way about me at that point .\nOur relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was very significant , at least to me .\nSo this went on for a few months and then I decided we should have \u201c the talk \u201d to define our relationship .\nI had a whole council meeting with my friends and we decided that I should be straight up and ask him \u201c What are we ?\n\u201d So I waited until the next time we were together in person and I just went for it .\nAnd he went white .\nHe fumbled over his words and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re just hanging out ?\n\u201d And I was actually OK with that , I wanted to be his girlfriend but I didn \u2019 t care that according to him we were just \u201c hanging out \u201d because I just wanted him in my life .\nBut after that , he wasn \u2019 t anymore .\nI just stopped hearing from him completely .\nAnd I was gutted .\nI mean beyond .\nBut I didn \u2019 t reach out\u2026 at least not yet .\nWeeks went by and I didn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found out he was telling people it was over between us .\nAnd I was crushed .\nI never felt such levels of despair in all my 17 years .\nI confronted him and he said he didn \u2019 t want to be serious with me and he could tell that \u2019 s what I wanted .\nI remember him going off about why do girls always ruin things by wanting it to be so serious ?\nAnd I tried telling him I was OK with it being casual but he was basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt \u2019 s done .\nAt that point , I was interning at US Weekly Magazine which was a really cool experience .\nMy high school had an internship program for second-semester seniors and by a stroke of luck I ended up there and what I remember most vividly was taking the train into New York city every morning and evening and replaying every interaction with him over and over in my mind ( to this day I can recount conversations we had back then verbatim and he thinks I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was a tape played on loop all day every day for many months ! )\n.\nEverything I said and he said and as I sit here right now telling you this story , I can feel that blade in my heart again .\nAfter a few months of obsessing and dwelling and crying , it was clear to me he wasn \u2019 t coming back .\nSo I tried to move on .\nI found a new guy we \u2019 ll call James who was really hot , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human being who treated me horribly .\nHe was a raging narcissist and just awful .\nI honestly blocked out a lot of my memories of him because he was so terrible .\nHe wasn \u2019 t physically abusive but he was extremely emotionally abusive and I just took it .\nI took it because I honestly thought that \u2019 s how I deserved to be treated .\nAnd he was very hot and to me , being with the \u201c hot guy \u201d was so validating , it fed something in me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around .\nMe and him had a few breakups , one of them by the girl he was cheating on me with texting me from his phone to let me know me and him were done .\nThat relationship did a number on me psychologically , and I was already in such a fragile place .\nFortunately , I went away to college in Boston so that was the end of him , even though he tried repeatedly to get back in my life for several years .\nAnd like any naive girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him back several times , but I was mostly done with that mess .\nCollege was fun- I partied hard , I continued to live for the attention , I was just like a little girl lost trying to find her way and figure out her worth .\nIt looked like the time of my life on the outside , but when I reflect on that time all I can feel is this emptiness that existed within me .\nOK , moving on .\nMy Junior year is the year I decided I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boyfriend .\nAnd a few weeks into the school year , I met Eric Charles- yes , my business partner on A New Mode .\nJust like with my ex , when I met Eric I had this overwhelming feeling that this person was meant to be in my life .\nAnd my instincts were right .\nBut Eric and I were not meant to be a couple , at all .\nSo I won \u2019 t get too into the details of my relationship with Eric because I \u2019 ve written about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact is , he and I were both two broken people trying to hide from our brokenness .\nAnd it was nice being together so that was a distraction .\nHe wasn \u2019 t in a position to be in a relationship and neither was I really .\nI was just a lost puppy starved for love and he couldn \u2019 t give it at that point , and he told me so !\nFrom the beginning , he told me he didn \u2019 t want to be in an official relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed me inside .\nAnd we did love each other and we did spend literally every waking moment together but it wasn \u2019 t a healthy relationship , and it wasn \u2019 t even an official relationship .\nThe fact that he wouldn \u2019 t give me that title just confirmed my long-standing belief about myself- I wasn \u2019 t worthy of love .\nI was damaged and unlovable and I better take what I can get .\nIt \u2019 s this or nothing .\nSo that relationship ended after about a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was devastated .\nBeyond devastated .\nI felt like I had been gutted from end to end .\nI felt like an essential organ has been ripped out and I could no longer function .\nI didn \u2019 t properly cope with the grief and the trauma of it all and instead , I went cold- I just turned my emotions off .\nI numbed myself out .\nBy my senior year of college , I became a self-proclaimed Maneater .\nI would go out and find the hottest guy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , just for the fun of it .\nNow up until this point , I was always the one being treated badly , but after that , the roles were reversed and I was just awful .\nAny guy who dared try to love me or date me , I was just awful .\nI was mean and cold and selfish .\nAfter I graduated , I moved to New York City and started working as a fashion and beauty editor .\nI was living a really cool and glamorous life .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ awards shows and interviewing celebrities and getting tons of free stuff and I had an amazing group of friends and my life was fast and fun .\nI was mostly focused on work and with the guys I dated , I was either not interested and acted cold and aloof , or I was desperate and needy .\nI met this guy named Kyle who I did really like , and at first he really liked me , but then the relationship devolved into what my relationships usually devolved into\u2013 it was me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shots and me just trying to make him love me .\nI could write a whole other essay on him and the lessons learned by the TLDR is this : he started distancing himself and pulling away , I tried everything to get him back , and he ultimately ghosted and then called me a few weeks later but he wasn \u2019 t calling me\u2026 he meant to call the new girl he started seeing .\nAt that time , my roommate sublet her room to this incredibly hot guy who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living with him is actually how I started gaining all my insight into men .\nAfter that fateful call , he and some of his friends sat me down and explained everything about the relationship and where it went wrong .\nAnd I actually felt better after hearing the honest truth .\nI didn \u2019 t even feel the need to obsess and spin my wheels\u2026 and I was the queen of that !\nI also remember thinking : this is what the world needs , the world needs to understand how men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fast forward a few years later , I got back in touch with Eric and in an attempt to get him back I tried making him jealous by talking about all these guys who were after me\u2026 it didn \u2019 t have the intended effect but instead , Eric suggested I write about this and share my knowledge with other women and that \u2019 s how ANM was born back in 2009 !\nI really committed myself to understanding personal development and relationships .\nI became the go-to guru for all my friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I \u2019 m the reason they were able to have success with men and relationships .\nI was really good at understanding relationship dynamics and I made it my mission to understand men and women and how they relate to one another .\nThings were starting to look pretty good for me and around this point , my parents had a charity event at our house and I vividly remember turning a corner and suddenly being face-to-face with my high school ex .\nI literally went weak in the knees .\nHe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked : \u201c What are you doing here ?\n\u201d And replied , \u201c I live here .\nYou \u2019 ve been here !\n\u201d And he said , \u201c I thought this house looked familiar.\n\u201d Our conversation was super brief because I legitimately felt like I was going to faint .\nI just couldn \u2019 t talk to him .\nI went off to some other part of the house and our eyes would lock from across the room but that was it .\nThe next night he messaged me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught up on what we \u2019 d been up for for the last five years plus .\nAnd he kind of apologized for what happened in the past without directly doing it .\nHe told me how he had changed , how he used to be a selfish terrible person who didn \u2019 t think about other people .\nUmm yeah , I know !\nAnd that night I was convinced we were getting back together .\nI was absolutely ecstatic .\nBut it didn \u2019 t happen \u2026 I didn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time marched on and I really started getting a grip .\nI started seeing an amazing therapist and really getting to the heart of some deeply rooted issues .\nI finally developed some self-respect and learned how to have some boundaries , I took a very long hiatus from boys and dating and just focused on me .\nI think it was about two years later , I ran into Mr. Ex again , this time halfway across the world !\nI saw him , and I got this feeling that just came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 m going to marry him .\nI know I am .\nSo we talked a little and he messaged me , but he didn \u2019 t really seem to have any interest in getting back together with me .\nWe would talk a little here and there , but then it fizzled out .\nA year later , I ran into him again .\nThis time in my hometown .\nBut this time , he wasn \u2019 t flirty or warm to me at all .\nIt was just , \u201c Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past our interactions were always full of intense chemistry , but this time it wasn \u2019 t there .\nI found out much later that he had a girlfriend at the time .\nI just thought he wasn \u2019 t interested in me which was devastating because I still desperately wanted to date him and was still carrying an almost decade-long torch for him !\nA month later I met a guy who I fondly refer to as Kevin the damage case .\nIf you \u2019 ve been a reader of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him because I \u2019 ve written about him a lot .\nHe is a classic example of a guy who just won \u2019 t or can \u2019 t commit , and my behavior toward him is a classic example of what many women do when faced with these kinds of guys .\nI \u2019 ll give you a quick summary here .\nHe and I had a lot of mutual friends and someone set us up .\nWe went on a few dates and then he dumped him .\nI was devastated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside from Ex ) , that I really liked in a long time .\nHe and I did this dance for a full year where we would run into each other , things would start up between us , then he would disappear .\nEvery few months I would see him , and this would happen and every time I would be crushed .\nWhat do they say about insanity ?\nIt \u2019 s doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results ?\nWell then , you could say I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point !\nNow this one really got me because I knew better at this point .\nI was a really successful relationship writer .\nI had bestselling books on relationships .\nAnd I was still playing this game !\nI honestly felt like a fraud but I couldn \u2019 t help it .\nI just wanted him so badly .\nIt all came to a breaking point that June .\nIt was so clear to me that while he liked me and was attracted to me , he couldn \u2019 t give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crystal clear clarity what I was doing and why .\nI was still that 12-year-old girl who was home alone on a Saturday night while all her friends were at the movies with their boyfriends .\nI was still that girl who was voted ugliest girl in 7th grade by the popular 8th-grade boys .\nI didn \u2019 t feel worthy of love because my most significant relationships were with guys who wouldn \u2019 t call me their girlfriend .\nI would chase after these gorgeous , emotionally unavailable guys because getting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me I was no longer that sad undesirable girl from middle school .\nI tell you guys this a lot- the subconscious is always looking to prove itself right .\nIf you believe you are unworthy , you will seek out relationships that confirm this .\nAnd that \u2019 s what I did .\nI dated plenty of good-looking , wonderful , emotionally available men who treated me so well , and I was repulsed by them .\nI thought something must be wrong with them .\nIt wasn \u2019 t them .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage case .\nOnce I saw my patterns for what they were , once I saw what I was doing and once I saw Kevin the damage case for who he truly was , it lost all appeal to me .\nNow I didn \u2019 t grow a sense of worth overnight .\nI worked on myself .\nA lot .\nI spent that entire summer living my best life .\nI worked out , I spent a lot of time writing , I spent a lot of time with friends , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of my game and so thoroughly , truly , genuinely happy .\nAt the end of July I was walking in Central Park with my friend and she was really upset about a guy and I spotted Mr. Ex talking to this girl I also went to high school with .\nAnd I told my friend , we have to go over there .\nI only run into this kid like once every few years , I have to say hi !\nSo I dragged her over , and I pretended I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high-school girl , not him , and then pretended to suddenly notice him .\n\u201c Oh hey , I didn \u2019 t even see you there !\n\u201d Then he and I started talking and our chemistry was back and stronger than ever and I walked away feeling confident I would hear from him .\nFinally , after all these years our stars had aligned .\nWe were both living in the city , both single , both settled in our lives \u2026 but I didn \u2019 t hear from him .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ I messaged him on Facebook and he was friendly and receptive , and I opened the door wide for him to ask me out \u2026 but he didn \u2019 t .\nBut this time I wasn \u2019 t devastated .\nI was fine with it .\nI just figured he \u2019 s not into me , if he is , he knows where to find me .\nSo I continued being my best self .\nAnd I had an amazing summer .\nAt the end of August , I went to Italy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed he started liking my status updates , which he had never done before .\nI had a strong feeling he was thinking about me \u2026 that he wanted to ask me out \u2026 that I would hear from him as soon as I got back into town .\nMy friend thought I was being delusional but lo and behold , two days after we got back he messaged me and asked me to grab a drink and catch up .\nI honestly didn \u2019 t even know if it was a date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day .\nLike couldn \u2019 t eat , couldn \u2019 t focus , couldn \u2019 t even walk in a straight line or take a full deep breath nervous .\nOur date was seven hours long and while I was very excited about the possibilities , I really tried to reign it in .\nOn our second date , I think we both knew we were going to get married .\nI remember him making some comment about how we should try to move slowly because this did just seem so right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to get too swept away too fast .\nAnd then I did what I tell you all to do- I kept my options open .\nI did not want to fully invest in one outcome .\nDid I desperately want it to work out with him ?\nYes !\nBut I did not want to set myself up for heartbreak .\nI had been through enough of that already .\nSo I was still talking to other guys and keeping my options open .\nBut I didn \u2019 t do that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple within like a month , and he told me he loved me I think in the second month .\nAnd I wanted him and I loved him , but I was also so scared .\nI had never been in a reciprocal relationship .\nI had never been in a healthy relationship .\nThe night after he told me he loved me I started panicking and trying to figure out what was wrong with him .\nAnd I tried pushing him away , I tried sabotaging the relationship .\nBut here \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly loves you , it will take a hell of a lot to talk him out of it !\nThe thing is , love will bring up all that is unloved within you .\nAnd it was bubbling to the surface .\nBut I was honest with him and vulnerable and we worked on it together .\nHe told me that nothing I could do would make him stop loving me .\nI could stab him in the chest and he would still love me .\nBut I didn \u2019 t put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really worked on it myself and it wasn \u2019 t easy .\nWe got engaged after six months of dating and married six months after that .\nOur wedding was actually one year to the day from our first date the second time around- that was just how it coincidentally worked out .\nAnd we now have three delicious children , the product of over a decade of back and forth and heartbreak and healing .\nOur relationship is far from perfect because none of them are , but I know without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the person I am meant to be with and there isn \u2019 t anyone I can imagine doing life with .\nI look back on all those other guys and I realize how miserable I would have been with them .\nLife isn \u2019 t just excitement and having fun .\nThat was great when I was single , but when you settle down and have kids , you need stability and security .\nYou need a guy who is a good person and a good dad and I found all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ask what made him change his mind and want me after all those years .\nAnd believe me , I asked , but he doesn \u2019 t really have an answer .\nAccording to him , he just thought about it a little more and it made sense .\nBefore that , he just saw me as a girl he dated in the past and it didn \u2019 t work out so that was that .\nAnd that \u2019 s how a lot of guys think .\nI have a different theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI was no longer that desperate , needy woman he once knew .\nI finally had a purpose and a sense of self and I was genuinely happy .\nI think that \u2019 s what drew him back in .\nIt wasn \u2019 t just the same old thing .\nThis time I was someone different .\nAlso , we can \u2019 t discount timing .\nBut the right person at the wrong time is the wrong person .\nSo over those 11 years , we just weren \u2019 t ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow individually .\nAnd you can \u2019 t control timing\u2026 all you can do is clean up your side of the street and get yourself to a solid , healthy place so you can have a happy , fulfilling relationship .\nAnd the moral of this very long story : Work on your feelings of worth .\nWork on recognizing and realizing that you deserve to have what you want in life .\nRecognize your faulty patterns and deal with them because your mind isn

Story\u2013a tale of what our favorite toys do when we leave the room\u2013the world was taken by the beautiful and often emotionally heavy storytelling of Pixar \u2019 s feature films .\nSo few realized how profound animated movies could be for a wide audience until this ragtag team of 3D modelers , animators , and storytellers started gracing our screens with their tales .\nWe \u2019 ve learned about our emotions in Inside , appreciated the hierarchy of insects in A Bug \u2019 s Life , and cried at real love and loss thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you \u2019 re wondering what the production company has coming up next , I have some news for you .\nThey just released a teaser trailer for their new movie , Elemental , and it looks incredibly cute .\nHere \u2019 s everything we know so far .\nThe teaser trailer jam-packs a lot into less than two minutes .\nAlthough it \u2019 s just one scene , we can make all sorts of assumptions about Elemental from that teaser trailer .\nIt \u2019 s channeling Zootopia , but instead of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmony , it \u2019 s the four elements personified .\nThey all share space on the train , Earth elements growing flowers , Water elements getting everyone moist , and Air elements defying gravity to sit atop the ceiling .\nThere \u2019 s only one Fire element on-board , and she appears to be the main character .\nShe certainly has main character energy , with her mysterious hoodie and her headphones playing an indie favorite ( \u201c Hell N Back \u201d by Bakar ) .\nAnd at the end , a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPixar is promoting the romance everywhere you look .\nAt the very end of the teaser , two elementals introduce themselves to each other : Wade , a Water element , and Ember , a Fire element .\nThey have that meet-cute moment where their hands almost touch .\nAdorable !\nThe thing is , some teaser trailers make plot points seem larger than they actually are .\nWill the romance be the main plot point ?\nJudging by how Disney/Pixar has been advertising the movie , it looks like all signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this gorgeous poster thanks to the official ( if we can trust blue checkmarks right now ) Twitter for the film .\nWade and Ember \u2019 s hands are reaching out for each other .\nAnd that tagline ?\n\u201c Opposites react \u201d is clearly a play on the age-old adage \u201c opposites

Qualities That Make Him Want To Pursue You", "content": "Have you noticed how certain women seem to have all the luck with men ?\nThey don \u2019 t really seem to do anything , and people are just drawn to them .\nAnd this has nothing to do with looks .\nSome people just have that certain something , the je ne sais quoi .\nAnd these qualities help them succeed in their relationships but carry over into their lives as well .\nSo what is it ?\nWhat is it that makes someone so effortlessly alluring ?\nWhat is it that makes a man want to pursue a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 .\nBeing totally happy on your own .\nBeing desperate for a relationship is not what \u2019 s going to get you a relationship .\nIf anything , it actually repels guys .\nIt \u2019 s fine to want to be in a relationship , that is normal , we \u2019 re humans and connection is a fundamental need .\nBut it becomes a problem when you attach things to having a relationship .\nMeaning , you think you won \u2019 t feel happy or confident or healed or comfortable in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a boyfriend .\nWhen you do this , you are basically ignoring your issues and what you need to face .\nYou \u2019 re falling into the as-soon-as trap .\nAnd it \u2019 s an easy trap to fall into !\nI \u2019 ll be happy as soon as I have X amount of money in the bank\u2026 as soon as I lose 10 pounds\u2026 as soon as I land my dream job\u2026 as soon as I have X amount of followers on social media .\nBut happiness does not from as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place conditions on your happiness .\nYou have to accept where you are in life .\nIf you \u2019 re single , then embrace it !\nTrust me , when that single season is done , it \u2019 s gone and you will never get it back and you will miss it someday .\nSo embrace it .\nIf you can embrace your life and love it for what it is right now , you will be so alluring and so attractive .\nBefore I started dating my husband I was in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after years of hating my single status and being ashamed of it .\nBut I decided to do things differently .\nI decided to just enjoy it and embrace it .\nWhen my husband came into the picture , I was very excited ( we actually had dated in high school and I never fully got over him , so I was thrilled he wanted to give it another shot ! )\n, but I \u2019 ll admit\u2026 I was a little sad about losing that single life !\nAnd because I loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him even more drawn to me and he really just wanted to be a part of it .\nAnd it wasn \u2019 t just him , I don \u2019 t think I \u2019 ve ever attracted as many men as I did during the phase when I was thoroughly in love with being single !\n2 .\nYou put yourself first .\nIn the early phases , please be a little selfish and put yourself first .\nI \u2019 m telling you this because this isn \u2019 t what most women do .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wants , his needs , and his feelings .\nWe spend so much time focusing on how he feels and what he wants that our own wants and needs get totally lost .\nAnd this isn \u2019 t appealing .\nDo not put the guy on a pedestal and try to be everything you think he wants , trying to prove that you \u2019 re perfect together or that he made the right choice by dating you .\nOnce you and he are in a more secure , established place , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make those compromises that make for a healthy relationship .\nBut that comes later .\nIn the beginning , you are not proving your worth to him .\nYou are just operating from a place of knowing your worth , of feeling secure within yourself .\nDon \u2019 t dwell on questions like : does he like me ?\nAnd instead , consider : \u201c Do I like him ?\nIs he worthy of me ?\n\u201d When you like a guy and want to get him to like you , your natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible .\nIf he wants you to drive over to his house at 11 pm , you will .\nIf he waits until the last minute to set up plans , you don \u2019 t say anything because you want to seem cool and laid back .\nThis is not sexy , high-value behavior !\nA man might keep a woman like this around for a while because she makes things easy and convenient for him , but this is not the kind of woman he becomes seriously interested in .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not the kind of woman he treats as a priority .\nThis is the kind of woman who ends up blindsided when he suddenly leaves her for someone else .\nBoundaries are sexy .\nKnowing what you deserve and not accepting less is sexy .\nThis is what gets a man to step up and bring his A-game to win you over .\nAnd when he puts in the effort , then he comes to invest and comes to really care about you .\nDon \u2019 t be afraid to draw your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re scared that doing so will push him away , then he was never that interested in the first place and you just saved yourself from wasting more time !\nOK , so this is something that happens a lot .\nI get messages all the time along the lines of : \u201c My boyfriend said this and that .\nWhat does he mean ?\n\u201d , \u201c Why hasn \u2019 t he introduced me to his friends yet ?\n\u201d , or \u201c We \u2019 ve been on 3 dates already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet !\n\u201d My reply to these questions is usually , \u201c Well , have you asked him ?\n\u201d And the response is , well no\u2026 I haven \u2019 t even thought of that .\nThese women are literally paying me , a dating coach they found through social media , to find out what \u2019 s going on in their relationships rather than just asking the guy !\nNow I appreciate the business , but all they really needed to do was ask him !\nI get where that hesitation comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditioned to be afraid of looking needy or desperate that we just don \u2019 t express our needs or feelings at all .\nBut doing this\u2026 is being desperate and needy , the two things you were trying to avoid !\nIt is very appealing and sexy to know what you want and express your needs .\nConfident , high-value people aren \u2019 t afraid to put themselves out there and express what they want .\n5 .\nDon \u2019 t give yourself away right away .\nI \u2019 m not talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article addressing that , I \u2019 m talking about your emotional self .\nYou don \u2019 t need to put everything out there right on the table .\nA lot of women feel like they have to show all their cards upfront .\nShe needs to show him that she \u2019 s smart and funny and educated and a good friend and a good cook and on and on because if she doesn \u2019 t tell him\u2026 how will he know ?\nHe \u2019 ll know because he \u2019 ll find out eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back just a touch , to leave a little bit of mystery .\nI write these words with such caution because there has been such a backlash against \u201c playing games \u201d in recent years ( and rightfully so ) , but this isn \u2019 t a game .\nIt \u2019 s just the art of attraction and seduction .\nIt all just essentially comes down to being a high-value woman .\nThat \u2019 s why \u201c games \u201d can be so effective at luring a guy in\u2026 they create the illusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an illusion !\nYou can \u2019 t keep up the ruse forever , eventually , your real self is going to come out .\nI don \u2019 t want you to pretend to be a confident , high-value woman , I want you to be one .\nAnd this kind of woman does not put on a whole song and dance to impress a man .\nShe can keep herself back a little until he has earned the privilege of peeling back a few more layers to learn more about the real her @", "author": "Sabrina

was losing my hair as if I was having chemo and losing weight every day .\nMy mental health was also collapsing .\nNone of those facts called my attention to the obvious .\nSomething was killing me , and I hadn \u2019 t noticed .\nSeveral times I visited doctors and health stations to investigate the origin of my fevers and weakness , the doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listen to my lungs , and tell me that \u201c your blood work looks normal , probably there \u2019 s a flu coming.\n\u201d It was a Friday morning in the middle of a cold and snowy winter when I fell very ill , and could barely move , breathe and communicate , and my husband decided to take me to emergency care .\nWe drove away whilst I was trying to understand what was going on and babbling random questions about the weather and what would we have for dinner .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe loose ends weren \u2019 t connecting .\nI couldn \u2019 t have a complete thought .\nI remember flashes from a doctor listening to my lungs and telling my husband it was sounding normal , and my husband nervously raising his voice demanding some sort of deeper examination because clearly , I wasn \u2019 t doing well .\nI tried to answer some questions but would give up before even making any sense .\nThe doctor finally sent me to the hospital , ordered an x-ray , and told my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the doctors and nurses at the next care provider .\nAt the hospital , they ran hundreds of tests on me .\nWe went to several different rooms and spoke to different doctors and one of them asked if I had ever had an STI test done , I said \u201c yes , \u201d she asked if it was OK for them to test me again , I said , \u201c yes , please , test me for everything.\n\u201d After around 14 hours of testing , they sent us home .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , around 11 pm , my husband answered and brought it to me .\nIt was one of the doctors asking me to go back to the hospital straight away .\nMy level of numbness was so deep that I had the chill to tell her I had no physical or mental condition to get back there at that very moment but asked if it was OK to go first thing the following morning .\nShe dithered , but agreed , saying it wouldn \u2019 t be her who would see me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t be an issue .\nThe next early morning , my husband and I entered the premises of the hospital and we were clearly being expected .\nThey knew my name , offered me water , and asked us to wait for someone to call me .\nI was very weak and could barely breathe .\nIt didn \u2019 t take long until a nurse came outside a door , and asked to come inside , \u201c alone.\n\u201d I looked at my husband and moved toward the room , where other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey checked my pulse , checked my blood pressure , and asked me to enter through another door , an annex from inside the room .\nI saw two chairs facing one another , a gurney , and a table .\nI was told to sit on one of those chairs and wait .\nA doctor sat in front of me and asked several questions , and while I tried to mumble some very short answers and say yes or no with my head she would watch me carefully , touch my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me some kind of support .\nShe then held my hands , gave me a staring look , and said : \u201c we tested you for HIV , and it was positive.\n\u201d I drowned .\nI couldn \u2019 t hear anything , I felt as if I was being swallowed by the ocean .\nI lost ground .\nWhen I was able to catch the air and blow a sound I said \u201c NO !\nIt \u2019 s impossible !\nIt \u2019 s wrong !\n\u201d She explained to me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test to confirm the first one in case of a positive result , but because of all the opportunistic infections I already had at that time , I not only had HIV , but I was in the late stages of AIDS , and that they needed to admit me into the hospital to start treatment immediately .\nI could barely react .\nA few days of brain fog followed that day , but I remember the doctors saying that my condition was extremely critical and that they didn \u2019 t know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me to communicate with my family , and , somehow , be ready .\nThe first person I told was my dad , then my sisters , and I told my mom I had pneumonia .\nI didn \u2019 t know how she was going to react .\nI got all the support I needed from them , my husband , and the doctors and nurses at the hospital .\nWhile in there , my only tasks were to rest and eat .\nI was looking calm but my mind was constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to think .\nI put things in perspective .\nI went through moments of self-stigma .\nI questioned my ability to make choices , my life , my future , everything .\nIn less than 2 weeks I was already feeling much stronger , and the doctors were looking a lot more optimistic , until the day they told me my body was responding beautifully to the medication , and I wasn \u2019 t at imminent risk of dying anymore .\nI would survive .\nThat was the moment that changed everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I would do everything within my reach to recover completely , and that was : taking my medication daily for the rest of my days , eating well , exercising , and sleeping well .\nAnd so I did .\nI stayed a total of 28 days in the hospital , and since day one , I am 100 % adherent to my medication .\nI love what I call \u201c my life pills \u201d and take them happily .\nI cherish every moment of my life and I became friends with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about HIV and AIDS turned out to be a passion .\nBut I was still keeping my HIV status a secret .\nIt seemed like a dirty secret I had to hide .\nBut it didn \u2019 t feel that way , at all .\nI was never ashamed of having HIV .\nI never made the infection easy , and I learned that pretty much ANYONE can be infected with HIV .\nI felt I needed to do something about all the misinformation and misconceptions around this subject building up the stigma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst thing about HIV .\nSo I spoke to my family and decided to come public about my status .\nThis was , unquestionably , the best decision I have ever made .\nI can say today that not only the HIV+ diagnosis saved my life \u2014 because otherwise , I \u2019 d have died of AIDS , but it also brought my life great purpose .\nI started advocating for HIV and AIDS awareness and had the chance of being connected with people from all over the globe .\nI offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very dark place soon after diagnosis to a much brighter perspective of future life .\nI have always been very positive .\nThere will always be unexpected problems to be dealt with in life .\nWe can \u2019 t avoid that .\nBut we can choose HOW we are going to handle them .\nAnd I do it turning my pains into something good .\nI face my problems with an open mind and heart .\nLiving with HIV nowadays is a chronic condition .\nTreatment is so effective that suppresses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live as if we don \u2019 t have it .\nAll we have to do is take our medication daily , as prescribed

usually to tell you what to say and not say , I prefer to address issues at the root and get to the mindset that causes the behaviors that may be preventing you from getting what you want .\nI thought this article would be fun to make and that we can use these phrases to get a better understanding of what makes a man lose interest .\nI also want to add that if these phrases are a little too familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have low self-esteem and that \u2019 s something you \u2019 ll want to address because low self-worth is the root of most problems .\nOK , here we go\u2026 Yes , I know that maybe you \u2019 ve been hurt in the past , but this attitude is toxic .\nLet \u2019 s just flip it for a second .\nLet \u2019 s say you were on a date with a guy who said all women are crazy or psycho , would you want to date him ?\n?\nNo !\nYou would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He clearly has strong negative feelings about women due to things he experienced in the past and it \u2019 s not your job to fix him and correct this .\nIf a woman already has the idea that all men are jerks , she will always be looking out for jerky behavior .\nShe will be hyper-vigilant , expecting him to dump her or do something horrible at any moment .\nYou can \u2019 t really form a connection or a relationship with someone like this .\nI also need to add\u2026 if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then maybe you need to change your taste in men ?\nHas any man in the history of mankind ever answered yes to this question ?\nWhat you \u2019 re really asking is : do you still find me desirable ?\nBecause I think I put on some weight and I want to make sure you \u2019 re still attracted to me .\nBut there is nothing desirable about being insecure .\nHe most likely will just get annoyed by the question and you are lowering your value by even asking it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .\nThere is never a good reason to compare him to your ex , at least not when it \u2019 s a comparison about how much better the ex was .\nLet \u2019 s flip it again , how would you feel if he compared you to his ex and pointed out the ways you were falling short ?\nYou can express your unmet needs to him in a way that doesn \u2019 t make him feel resentful toward you .\n4 .\nWhat are you thinking about right now ?\nYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he \u2019 s thinking , you want to know if he \u2019 s thinking about you and if he \u2019 s thinking about the relationship .\nYou don \u2019 t want to hear that he \u2019 s thinking about Fantasy Football or whatever nonsense is swirling around up there .\nFocus on feeling secure in the relationship so you don \u2019 t need so much assurance from him .\nIf you have a hard time feeling secure , ask yourself why .\nDo you not trust him\u2026 or do you not trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people will hurt you because that \u2019 s been your experience thus far ?\n5 .\nNope , nothing is wrong \u2026 when something is wrong .\nDon \u2019 t expect him to be a mind reader .\nYeah , I know you \u2019 d prefer that he be able to intuit your every thought and feeling and manage it accordingly but that \u2019 s not his job and that \u2019 s not possible .\nEmotional maturity comes from recognizing your needs and expressing them in a way that doesn \u2019 t blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are we ?\nGuys don \u2019 t like having the talk , and the fact is , in the right relationship with someone who is on the same page as you , there really isn \u2019 t a need to have a formal discussion about the relationship and where things are headed .\nBringing up \u201c the talk \u201d in a forced way will just make him feel pressured and then the whole power balance of the relationship is thrown off if he isn \u2019 t ready to commit in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a position of waiting to see if he chooses you and this is a very disempowering place to be .\nIt \u2019 s much better to let things unfold organically without force or pressure .\nAnd if he doesn \u2019 t want the same kind of relationship you want , don \u2019 t be afraid to walk away and realize you will find better .\n7 .\nGuys always ghost or dump me .\nYou don \u2019 t really need to share this information \u2013 he won \u2019 t feel sorry for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking maybe something is wrong with you .\nI get the intention , you \u2019 re telling him this has happened in the past and it \u2019 s been hurtful and you \u2019 re hoping by sharing this information will make him think twice before he ghosts\u2026 but it won \u2019 t .\nAlso , this makes you seem low value- so you \u2019 re basically telling him you \u2019 re from the reject pile and that \u2019 s not exactly alluring !\nGuys rarely respond well when you phrase something like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naggy and ungrateful and will just cause him to retreat and feel resentful and be even less likely to do what you want .\nIt is much more effective to phrase things like : \u201c I really love it when you\u2026 \u201d Guys need to feel appreciated , if you come away from this article with one takeaway , let it be that !\n9 .\nWhere have you been ?\nGuys don \u2019 t want to feel like you \u2019 re keeping tabs on them- especially not in the beginning !\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was and why he didn \u2019 t text back promptly early on , it \u2019 s a bad sign and signals the beginning of the end .\nIf it \u2019 s early on and you \u2019 re not even official , he \u2019 s most likely is seeing other people and he doesn \u2019 t yet owe you exclusivity or explanations .\nIf you expect them and demand them , then you \u2019 re pulling the reigns in way too tight way too soon and he most likely won \u2019 t want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also add when a guy really likes you , he won \u2019 t usually leave you hanging .\nIf he takes an exceptionally long time to get back to you , he \u2019 ll usually tell you why .\nIf he disappears often and with no explanation , he probably likes you\u2026 but doesn \u2019 t like you enough .\n10 .\nWe need to talk .\nIs there a more chilling combination of words than this ?\nI think not .\nIf you need to talk , be more specific about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so his mind isn \u2019 t jumping to the worst-case scenario , which we often do with this phrase .\nMy mom texted me a variation of this the other day and I thought maybe there was a death in the family .\nJust stay away from this one !\n11 .\nSo when am I going to hear from you again ?\nThis just comes across as desperate and needy- almost like you \u2019 re expecting not to hear from him again .\nIt is much better to just assume he likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him .\nI have a friend who would always give a guy specific instructions , like \u201c Call me tomorrow night \u201d after meeting a new guy .\nThis conveys confidence because you \u2019 re assuming he is going to want to call and talk to you and you \u2019 re just letting him know when you \u2019 re free 12 .\nBringing up things he did in the past that you \u2019 ve already forgiven him for .\nDon \u2019 t do this ,

restaurant we know more or less what flavors to expect , based on the description of a dish .\nThe execution of flavor and what sets any food apart comes from the magic of the kitchen .\nOne must laud the Writers ( Seth Reiss and Will Tracy ) and Director ( Mark Mylod ) for the guts to make a project as typically predictable as this .\nThe audience walking in has only so many ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film , and keeping the material fresh is as challenging as a great chef making a simple dish taste new .\nIn many ways this film presents us with predictable base ingredients .\nThe cast is comprised of a douchey trio of wall street bros , a pair of insufferable food snobs , an estranged married couple , an aging Hollywood actor with his lover / assistant , and a couple on a first date ; one of which is an enthusiast of fine cuisine .\nYou could quite easily plug and play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flick .\nWhat made this a better base mixture was the quality of said ingredients .\nWhile nobody jumped out in an Oscar race , there were no bad performances .\nEveryone was sound in their role .\nThe opening segment takes this group to a remote island where an exclusive restaurant and hermitic chef awaits to provide them all with an exclusive dining experience .\nThe previews and opening setup eludes to a \u201c Willy Wonka \u201d meets The \u201c Most Dangerous Game \u201d through-line .\nRight from the jump the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe problem with this setup is that it \u2019 s been done ad nauseam .\nImmediately the mind jumps to an inevitable manhunt , booby traps , hostage situation , and cannibalism .\nRefreshingly though , The Menu kept its poise and presented us with a fun and distinctively formatted deliverance .\nThe guts of the movie are broken up by courses delivered to the special patrons of the restaurant and described playfully in a menu \u2019 d font and restaurant logo on the screen , complete with ingredients listed .\nWith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bits revealed not only about the guests , but the chef himself .\nIt slowly simmers to a dark \u201c 12 Angry Men \u201d vibe as people in small pressurized spaces are forced to divulge their past .\nThe antagonist and head chef ( Chef Slowik ) is played by the always engrossing Ralph Fiennes .\nHis intensity in the part plays well as someone who must lead a kitchen of artist experts , while also cleverly revealing secrets as the film progresses .\nAs Ralph does , he delivers his dialogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encapsulates the tone of the film .\nIn essence he is the butter of the dish .\nHe \u2019 s the guilty secret that makes everything taste good .\nThere aren \u2019 t any classic protagonists in the film , but the closest we come is Anya Taylor-Joy .\nShe carries as much screen time as Fiennes and delivers the same performance she has in every one of her small or large screen endeavor .\nShe \u2019 s the salt of the dish .\nWe know what salt does , it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dish .\nIn this case the creators stopped just shy of over seasoning .\nWhile Taylor-Joy is just fine , she is outshined here by patrons Nicholas Hoult , Janet McTeer , and employee Hong Chau who each steal the limited scenes they \u2019 re in .\nUnfortunately they \u2019 re reduced to little more than character actors , but each exudes enough talent where you wish you had more than an amuse bouche portion of them .\nThe pacing of the film is perfect as we effortlessly move from one course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drag of the foreseeably obvious unfolding customer stories .\nThe interweaving of personal revelation with the gastronomy and ever changing tales from the chef makes one forget that nearly the entire film takes place in one room .\nIt \u2019 s impressive and hard to accomplish .\nLikewise the score of the film is deceptively simple .\nIt \u2019 s string heavy and singular in instrumentation while also sparse .\nIt makes its usage dramatic and builds into the small bits divulged through the chef in each course .\nThe big reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which did make this a fun twist on an old dish .\nEven if just the equivalent of a sprig of parsley , it \u2019 s enough to liven the palate and make it memorable for a time .\nThe late Anthony Bourdain often used to say , \u201c Good food is very often , even most often , simple food \u201d .\nLike a seasoned chef , The Menu embraces this concept and that \u2019 s what makes it a fun watch .\nOf all the wild and dark places the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initially stepping off the ferry onto the remote island , it doesn \u2019 t take you to the realm of a burnt out chef making one last meal for a room full of assholes .\nThere \u2019 s no people eating people , there \u2019 s no violent gore and man as prey , it \u2019 s real and beautiful food served to those that represent the chef \u2019 s mental decline .\nThe twist is that there is no major twist .\nThe chef in his finale has lost his passion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , along with his customers , and kitchen .\nIn that concept we understand the vision of great chefs , creating temporary flavors that are fleeting and beautiful in the moment .\nThere are some bitter bites to the dish though .\nThe film failed to explain ( or even try ) the devotion of Chef \u2019 s staff and willingness to all perish with him .\nEven in the ending some of the doomed diners seemingly agree with the chef \u2019 s lunacy and embrace his cult mentality before their demise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also a definitive lack of food porn in this film .\nFor something that was spoofing the high end culinary experience , we should have been treated to a bit more of the science and beauty of that creation instead of the plated finale as its presented .\nThere was also nothing remarkable about the direction or cinematography of this film and no coherency in material to push it into horror .\nIt \u2019 s teetering closer to thriller as it just hesitated to go darker and lean into the cheeky concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the film is good fun but not extraordinary .\nThe Menu is a fine film to get your movie dollars out of and indeed enjoyable , but you \u2019 ll likely forget in a year until you catch it on basic cable or someone mentions S \u2019 mores .\nIf it were an actual restaurant it would have a B rating .\nThat said , I \u2019 ve had many a fine meal at a B restaurant and didn \u2019 t get food

him and had no life outside of that relationship .\nAnd then I started dating a new guy .\nHe was wonderful and smart and emotionally healthy and sweet and even though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice .\nAlmost as if some sort of radar signal was sent off\u2026 as soon as I was getting strong and happy , my ex swooped right back in .\nThe no contact period wasn \u2019 t over yet , but he called me desperate to see me .\nI didn \u2019 t soften to him as I had always done in the past .\nI was angry .\n\u201c Why are you contacting me ?\nWe \u2019 re not supposed to be talking right now , I can \u2019 t

.\nYou need to feel your feelings , you need to mourn , and you need to just be with yourself .\nIt \u2019 s a process .\nAnd this process will be interrupted if your ex keeps coming in and out of your life .\nDon \u2019 t delude yourself : this will mess with your head .\nEvery time he comes back you \u2019 re going to have to start all over again .\nThink of yourself like an addict in rehab ( not such a stretch , love is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can \u2019 t give in to your temptation even just a little .\nYes , it may make you feel better in the moment , but you will be much worse off in the grand scheme .\n2 .\nIt will give you perspective .\nIt \u2019 s only when you step outside of something that you can see it for what it is .\nOnce you \u2019 re out of it , you \u2019 ll be able to see it all more clearly .\nBreakups usually have a surface reason and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t unravel overnight , it happens steadily over time and is the result of a buildup of problems , resentment , and negativity .\nAnd a lot of the time , things can \u2019 t be repaired and need to stay broken .\nOther times you may realize the problems are fixable and maybe you \u2019 ll realize the inner work you need to do on yourself to get there .\nHaving space gives you the room to see things more clearly and that \u2019 s always a good thing .\n3 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNow maybe you \u2019 re thinking , \u201c But I don \u2019 t want to get over him !\nI want to get him back.\n\u201d In order to get him back , you need to work on getting over him .\nYou have to look at reality as it is right now .\nRight now you \u2019 re not back together , you are single .\nSo you need to operate from that frequency .\nIf he \u2019 s the right man for you , trust that he \u2019 ll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t want to try again , at least you \u2019 ve actively been moving on so you \u2019 re not at square one .\nAs they say\u2026 time heals .\nBut as I say , it isn \u2019 t a passive process , it \u2019 s active .\nYou need to do the work and then let time make the memories more cloudy .\nAnd if he \u2019 s in your life still , then it won \u2019 t heal anything it will just keep you stuck , The no-contact period gives you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grief , and this is a necessary part of healing .\nYou can \u2019 t get over him if he \u2019 s right there in front of you .\nAll you \u2019 ll focus on is how badly you want him and how much you miss him \u2026 and not on whether he \u2019 s the right guy for you , which is what you should be thinking about .\n4 .\nYou need to remember you can live without him .\nSometimes it genuinely feels like we will not be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that is patently untrue .\nYou can go on and you may even become an even better , stronger version of yourself .\nIt \u2019 s only when you \u2019 re away from him , fully away , that you \u2019 ll be able to realize this .\nYou \u2019 ll have that space to get back in touch with yourself and your intrinsic value .\nYou might think it \u2019 s no big deal to meet up with your ex for a drink \u2026 or to show up at his door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am \u2026 or even something as innocent as replying to his texts\u2026 but these are massive mistakes .\nFor one , you risk getting into what I call a post-relationship relationship , which I consider to be the worst type of relationship .\nYou talk sometimes , and hang out sometimes , but you \u2019 re in a relationship no-mans-land .\nNone of the issues ever get solved .\nYou get into a pattern of breaking it off , missing each other , getting together , feeling high on infatuation , realizing ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working , breaking it off , and repeating the cycle .\nThis has toxic written all over it .\nOr you risk him meeting someone else and dropping you like a hot potato like what happened to me .\nThe moral of the story : no good can come from staying in touch with an ex after a breakup .\nSo follow the no-contact rule until you feel strong enough to be in touch with him again .\nThis means you would feel totally OK if he doesn \u2019 t want to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this sends you to the pit of despair , you \u2019 re not ready yet .\nBe kind to yourself

re going through a breakup or just trying to get over a guy who doesn \u2019 t reciprocate your feelings , then I feel for you .\nI know how alone and isolating the experience can be .\nIt feels like the pain is yours and yours alone and no one could possibly understand .\nBut I understand !\nI \u2019 ve been in the depths of it , the real ugly , dark , twisty , gut-wrenching depths and I climbed my way out many times and have helped countless others do the same .\nBefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you how I used to handle breakups , or at least , how I handled a few of the most major breakups I experienced .\nWhat I did was obsess and replay everything that happened and what I wish I had done differently .\nThen I would get lost in an endless array of distractions .\nI was going , going going , keeping myself busy , run away from the pain before it could find me .\nUnfortunately , pain doesn \u2019 t go away just because it goes unacknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it fester , the worse it will be for you .\nI took it all way too personally and these feelings of inadequacy bled into almost every relationship I had after .\nI let a lot of faulty beliefs about myself get deeply wired into my psyche and it took many years to undo it all .\nDon \u2019 t be like me !\nThey say time heals , and in some ways this is true , but it takes more than time .\nYou also have to process the situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make peace , you need to get in touch with your inner strength , and you need to move on as a better , stronger person than you were before .\nLet \u2019 s talk about how to do that .\nYou have to accept reality as it is right now .\nThat \u2019 s not what most people do after a breakup .\nThey either get stuck in the past and how great everything used to be .\nThey think about the fun times , the happy memories .\nOr they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endlessly if he \u2019 ll come back and plot ways to get him back .\nThey think of how amazing it will all be if it all works out , if he comes back and they live happily ever after .\nThey desperately yearn for this fantasy future .\nGet out of the past and get out of the future , be in the present .\nBe in the right now .\nYou can \u2019 t go back to the past , you can \u2019 t force a future , just be with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he are not together and that most likely won \u2019 t change anytime soon .\nAccept it and embrace it .\nEmbrace that your time is your own right now , that you get the chance to work on the relationship with yourself .\nEmbrace the fact that the future is unknown , you don \u2019 t know what comes next and that can be pretty exciting .\nAlso , do not contact him .\nThe no-contact rule is essential after a breakup .\nGive it some time and space right now- don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t look for closure , and definitely do not beg him to take you back .\nI would also advise against trying to stay friends because this only works if both of you have zero romantic feelings left , and it takes a long time before that can happen .\nAccept that this is your reality- and he \u2019 s not in it .\nI know it feels personal , I know it feels like you weren \u2019 t good enough , that you should have done something else , been some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt \u2019 s not what happens to us , but the stories that we tell ourselves about what happened that cause all the pain .\nSo he breaks up with you\u2026 and you tell yourself it \u2019 s because you were unworthy , you \u2019 re unlovable , and you \u2019 re going to end up alone .\nThis becomes imprinted in your psyche and you go through life looking for evidence that proves how you already feel about yourself .\nSo if you \u2019 re seeing a new guy and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your immediate instinct is to believe it \u2019 s because he \u2019 s losing interest\u2026 because you \u2019 re unworthy .\nYou don \u2019 t even entertain the idea that he could just be busy .\nThese faulty beliefs will continue to sabotage you at every turn , so be mindful of what narrative you \u2019 re spinning about what happened .\nAnd please realize , it \u2019 s not because you weren \u2019 t enough .\nSometimes the timing just isn \u2019 t right and sometimes two people just aren \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t because you weren \u2019 t enough .\nI know this is how it might feel , but that is a destructive belief , and also a false one .\nEveryone has different things they want and need in a partner .\nThere might be some things about you that one guy doesn \u2019 t want , and those qualities may end up being what the right guy loves more than anything about you .\nThis can be the hard part , but it has to be done .\nWhatever it is you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don \u2019 t bury it , don \u2019 t hide from it , don \u2019 t ignore it .\nFeel the awful , brutal feelings .\nMourn the loss , because a breakup is a loss .\nIt \u2019 s the loss of potential , the loss of what could have been .\nIn the beginning , I \u2019 m sure you had grand visions of where this would go ; that \u2019 s because the beginning is always a euphoric time .\nBut things didn \u2019 t pan out the way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .\nA breakup can almost feel like a death .\nThis person was once a major part of your life and now they \u2019 re just gone .\nAnd this is sad no matter what , even if you realized that he wasn \u2019 t the right man for you .\nGive yourself time to grieve and be kind and gentle to yourself .\nDon \u2019 t get mad at yourself for feeling what you \u2019 re feeling ; accept it as a part of the process .\nBut don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLife must go on and you \u2019 ll never move forward if you keep mourning this loss .\nI would say give yourself a week , max , to let it all out , and then try to pick up the pieces .\nThis can be a part of the grieving process , and while it may sound pointless , it is incredibly therapeutic and can assist in helping your feelings process .\nYour emotions are all over the place after a breakup .\nRage , sadness , longing , anger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all in the span of just 30 minutes .\nNo matter what state you \u2019 re in , write a letter with all the things you want to say to him , whether you \u2019 re feeling fury and want to let him have it , or you \u2019 re feeling nostalgic and want to reflect upon the happier times .\nJournaling can also be very therapeutic and a great way to get to know the most important person in your life : yourself .\nEverything that happens in life , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential to tear us down or take us to a higher place .\nAs brutal as breakups are , they are a great time to do some reflection and inner work .\nRather than stewing in feelings of hurt and pain , try to find a way to come out of this better than you were before .\nA study called \u201c Changes in Self-Definition Impede Recovery from Rejection \u201d published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin examined the link between rejection and a person \u2019 s sense of self .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed or static view felt the pain of rejection more intensely and for much longer .\nThose participants saw rejection as more of a revelation of who they really were , which then caused them to be more closed and defensive in future relationships .\nSo much so , that they were still being negatively influenced by rejections that had happened over five years before .\nIn contrast , participants with a growth mindset , though still hurt by the breakup , were ready to let it go and could see a bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow is to learn the lessons and try to repair and heal .\nHere are a few good questions to ask yourself : \u2022 None What did I learn from this relationship that I can use in my next relationship ?\n\u2022 None What did I do in this relationship that I won \u2019 t ever do again in another relationship ?\n\u2022 None What qualities do I truly need in a partner ?\n( Think of qualities your ex had that you appreciated , as well as areas where he was lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 None Why did I stay even though the relationship wasn \u2019 t working ?\n\u2022 None What did I learn about myself through my time with him ?\n6 .\nSeparate the need from the person .\nAnytime you catch yourself thinking of him or missing him , ask yourself : What do I miss ?\nMaybe you miss the connection you shared .\nOk\u2026 now you \u2019 re going to separate him from the need .\nThe problem is a lot of us attach a need to a person .\nYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him , and you erroneously believe the only way to feel that again is to get him back .\nBut that isn \u2019 t true .\nSo when you have that thought , log it in as a data point : \u201c I \u2019 m someone who needs to feel connected.\n\u201d And then look for ways to increase your feelings of connection , maybe you call a friend or family member , or maybe you spend time connecting to yourself .\n7 .\nGet excited about your next relationship .\nOnce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to love yourself , and learned the lessons that will help you be an even better person , get excited to use these newly acquired tools to have an even better relationship with a man who is even more suited for you .\nI know how daunting it can feel to dive back into the dating pool , but don \u2019 t focus on the annoying sides of dating , think of the exciting parts .\nThink about how thrilling a new relationship can be\u2026that first date , the first kiss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential that lies ahead .\nThink about how amazing it will be to start fresh with someone new .\nThink about what it will be like to be with a man who truly gets you , who appreciates you for the sum of all your parts , who cherishes you and would do anything to make you happy .\nHe exists ; he \u2019 s out there .\nYou \u2019 ll just have to have faith on that one because until he shows up , it can feel like you \u2019 ll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , you \u2019 ll wonder how you ever could have been worried about not finding it because what you have is just so right and it \u2019 s so clear .\nHere is a manifestation exercise for you to try : spend some time every day visualizing what you want your next relationship to be like .\nPicture how it feels , how he treats you , how he looks at you .\nFeel it as if it \u2019 s happening right now .\nAnd get excited for what \u2019 s ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always feel the way you feel right now .\nJust keep going and growing and trust that everything will work out as it is meant to .", "author": "Sabrina Bendory", "url":

Ranked\u00a0\u2014 And Who Is Destined To Fill The Tux?", "content": "007 is one of those rare franchise characters exhibiting multiple actor \u2019 s interpretations over generations .\nIt \u2019 s a role that has to date , been played seven times over six decades in twenty seven films .\nIt \u2019 s an astonishing number of films we will certainly never see duplicated .\nWith rapidly evolving tech and an ever changing map , James Bond has been forced to update interpretations of the secret agent persona to reflect the time of its filming .\nThat said , there are clearly some iterations that stand out above others and likewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role .\nThe debate rages on as to who is the best Bond and even more heated is the race to find the next one , as the franchise steadily marches on .\nNow that the Daniel Craig era is at an end , it \u2019 s time for us to weigh in on who we think the best 007 has been so far and who should be on the short list to take up the gauntlet , or Walther PPK as it were .\nHere are the Bonds to date , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembers this guy in the Bond world .\nPoor David .\nHe had some big shoes to fill and many creative \u201c choices \u201d were made .\nAfter Sean Connery retired from the role , Niven stepped in to film \u201c Casino Royale \u201d in 1967 .\nIt was not a standard Bond film but a comedy and also featured the likes of Peter Sellers and Woody Allen .\nIt was enough of a departure from the established formula that it was a one off for Niven and the only Bond film to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one off attempts was Australian actor George Lazenby .\nAnother single film casualty , Lazenby was a victim of being too realistic and following Connery \u2019 s beloved version which many believe is best .\nThis iteration of Bond is much closer to the book \u2019 s vision .\nGeorge and Director Peter R. Hunt , brought grittiness and close physical combat to the part instead of pure gimmick , at the cost of charm and romance .\nThis was not appreciated by the masses in 1969 .\nGeorge \u2019 s biggest problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years too early .\nWelcome to the Gentleman bond era .\nRoger had the charm , the hair , the one liners , and some fresh comic book style adversaries that took the franchise to the stratosphere .\nThis is really the version of Bond that set the modern formula .\nEvery film had exotic locales , bad guys with private lairs , henchmen with high tech appendages and marketable nicknames , and yet each somehow blended subtle comedy in with the action .\nMany love this version of the character most , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedded more ladies than would come before or after .\nOn paper , Pierce is the obvious choice for Bond .\nHe \u2019 s Roger Moore version 2 .\nThere \u2019 s absolutely no denying that \u201c Goldeneye \u201d is one of the best Bond Films made , but things went downhill quickly after that .\nWhile Brosnan is also a great Bond , he was a casualty of popular film trends .\nThe late 90 \u2019 s and early 2000 \u2019 s put an amplifier on the already tired formula of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEvery film had two bond girls , one of whom would likely die but not before a roll in the hay with our hero .\nBrosnan \u2019 s bond was rarely in physical combat and routinely saved by the gadget dujour , introduced in the first act .\nIn each film Brosnan was akin to Adam West \u2019 s Batman who luckily wore his shark repellant boots when the head honcho left him to die .\nIt was so commercialized it often felt like these films were made to sell watches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switched to BMW from Aston Martin .\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum is Craig .\nHe \u2019 s a gorilla in a tux .\nAfter the Brosnan era spared us from heavy hand to hand fighting , the pendulum swung the other way as Craig was nearly all combat .\nThe 2006 remake of \u201c Casino Royale \u201d kicked the door in and introduced the new Bond in an exciting way .\nIt was a refreshing change and reinvigorated the franchise that seemed on its last legs .\nThat said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fell into predictable mediocrity afterwards .\nCraig \u2019 s version was more grounded in realism as well with the spy gimmicks toned down and mostly trapped in the Aston Martin he drove .\nCraig gave the franchise a great run and was fueled by a series of solid directors like Sam Mendes adding art and serious cinematography to an action heavy series .\nHe was also heavily aided with the regular supporting talent of Judy Dench , Ralph Fiennes , Ben Whishaw , Rory Kinnear , and Jeffrey Wright .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like George Lazenby , Timothy Dalton \u2019 s version of bond is steely and true to the book \u2019 s vision .\nAlso like his predecessor , Dalton \u2019 s interpretation of the character came decades too early for audiences to evolve their appreciation for realness over fantasy .\nDalton brings a dark , mysterious badass quality to 007 and perhaps needed more typically cheesy Bond scripts to balance him out .\nDalton was the mission focused killer the post Moore era asked for , and rejected once they got him .\nIts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Roger Moore years earlier in For Your Eyes Only , Octopussy , and A View to a Kill , to force the previous Bond \u2019 s retirement .\nHe should have accepted .\nThose classics could have really ignited his career as the tone of \u201c The Living Daylights \u201d and \u201c License to Kill \u201d are not as lighthearted as the aforementioned films .\nWhat is there to say about the GOAT ?\nConnery took the world of nail biting , deadly espionage and turned it into a playful , lasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned charming and charismatic that an entire generation ignored the sloppy combat scenes and ease that he was repeatedly captured only to escape without any real spy craft .\nThe Bond era under Connery is one where the bad guy will likely become your friend , ply you with food and drink and look the other way while you bed his girlfriend .\nThis is at a time where men had come home from WW2 and Korea so they knew what real action was .\nAudiences were transitioning into darker , adult themes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corniness of Connery purely because of cool .\nThe man was so loved that he retired the role , came out of retirement to play bond again in the 70 \u2019 s , then came out of second retirement to played Bond yet again as late as the 1980 \u2019 s , going head to head with Roger Moore \u2019 s version .\nConnery is and will always be Bond .\nIf he was still alive today , he \u2019 d likely be recast as 007 again .\nOkay , hear me out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 007 , he is better .\nThe James Bond Franchise has lost its way .\nA decade ago , \u201c Skyfall \u201d was the last quality entry and only because it was a back to basics storyline with a tremendous villain that was much needed .\nThere was a void in realistic and updated spy movies after \u201c Casino Royale \u201d , and Tom Cruise stepped back in as Mission Impossible \u2019 s Ethan Hunt to completely resuscitate his own franchise .\nStarting with \u201c Ghost Protocol \u201d , the M.I .\nseries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle chases , large scale consequences , insane stunts , and a lead character who won \u2019 t pause the mission because a girl in a bikini wants to get familiar .\nEthan Hunt as a spy is more believable than Bond ever was .\nOf course these two were never meant for direct comparison , but Mission Impossible has now become the fun that 007 used to be .\nI dare you to name any singular James Bond film as good as \u201c Ghost Protocol \u201d , \u201c Rogue Nation \u201d , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three films in a row of such quality .\nWe are all anxiously awaiting the last two installments of Cruise \u2019 s M.I .\ncoming to theaters soon .\nIt \u2019 s a high bar that is raised only by Cruise himself , and is only making it harder for a new James Bond to emerge .\nEnough about who was best .\nIt \u2019 s time to recast .\nSo who \u2019 s next to wear the tux ?\nHere \u2019 s a short list of the top contenders best suited for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next James Bond ?\nIdris is easily the number one draft pick .\nHe \u2019 s the obvious choice with the looks , skill , box office draw , and action resume .\nThe problem is age .\nNo one has started the Bond role over 50 and while the man looks good , one must ask how long he can play such a demanding physical part with realism .\nThat said , Roger Moore did play the part until nearly 60 , so Elba could easily squeeze out a few Bond films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this man the part already and start filming before it \u2019 s too late .\nThe clock is ticking .\nThere has been a steady buzz associating Hardy and future 007 casting .\nTom has shown moments of acting greatness in \u201c Bronson \u201d and the more debonair turn in \u201c Inception \u201d was a welcome change .\nHowever , Hardy \u2019 s largest roles are ironically when the director covers his face and limits his dialogue .\n\u201c Bane \u201d , \u201c Venom \u201d , \u201c Mad Max \u201d , he keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges brawler which may not be the direction for the franchise after fifteen years with Daniel Craig .\nTom exudes that young Pierce Brosnan energy .\nHe \u2019 s the best fit and has the pedigree to be a lady smashing , British secret agent .\nIf you make a list of role requirements , he checks every box with style and ease .\nThe accent is smooth , the delivery is poised , he reeks of gentleman suave , and is tailor made to wear a tux .\nHiddleston has plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , but has that long term role ruined his ability to be the white knight or does it grant him license to walk in the gray areas of the spy world and blur the lines of good and evil ?\nIf we \u2019 re going purely on talent then Chiwetel Ojiafor should be given the role tomorrow .\nHe \u2019 s easily the best actor on the list .\nWe haven \u2019 t seen much of his action side even though he \u2019 s been in a Marvel movie and likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe intriguing thing about Ojiafor is that he brings a modern realism to the role .\nJames Bond should never be the prettiest man at the party .\nSticking out and drawing all attention is a relic of the Connery era that would get a spy killed on their first assignment today .\nOjiafor would be a believable version that could blend in , slip in and out of gatherings while being cool and sophisticated enough to charm an asset one on one .\nWith a diverse resume of leading heroes Cavill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in \u201c Superman \u201d , \u201c The Witcher \u201d , \u201c Immortals \u201d , \u201c Stardust \u201d , Cavill is often cast with a charm and goodness that can also turn if pushed .\nHe \u2019 s already believably played spies in \u201c Mission Impossible : Fallout \u201d as well as \u201c The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\n\u201c While he offers the same imposing physical presence as Daniel Craig , he offers a likability and range that his predecessor did not .\nJust please don \u2019 t edit out his mustache if he wears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ve watched grow over the years , Dev has the ability to be a new take on Bond that shows the ever evolving world of secret agents .\nGone are the standard Caucasian Brits of the 60 \u2019 s that are unable to stay in the beating sun of the riviera for more than a few minutes .\nPatel is a modern Brit and has a chameleon quality to him as divergent as the films he chooses .\nLong hair or short , beard or shaven , accent or no , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be for any role and thusly a great agent that adapts to the mission .\nNo James Bond in history has ever been anything but a stiff Brit in a tux and Patel could change all that .\nHe \u2019 s the everyman that makes all guys think that if called , they could suit up and be spies .\nOut of nowhere comes newcomer Rege Jean-Page .\nThe lady fans of Bond threw his hat into the ring for him .\nHe \u2019 s a late bloomer but deservedly getting recent attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another reboot year one Bond style reinvention .\nHe \u2019 s young , attractive , has physical presence and solid range .\nHe established himself as a serious talent as Chicken George in \u201c Roots \u201d then cemented himself as full blown heartthrob as the Duke of Hastings in \u201c Bridgerton \u201d .\nSure he \u2019 s best known for showing his bare ass and a strong pull out game but isn \u2019 t that half of the Bond role anyway ?\nRege would be the most believable lady killer on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an action star .\nThis is the choice that will put younger people in theater seats and continue the franchise but the studio would still be forced to show his abs and ass in every single film .\nIt \u2019 s not the worst compromise to ensure James Bond \u2019 s longevity .", "author": "Brandon Trones", "url":

peace-offering to an audience formerly known as \u201c disgruntled OA fans \u201d , once dismissed by the streaming giant on the alleged basis of niche taste but who now seem to represent a growing demand for an emerging genre with a business case .\nThe latest from duo Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese , co-creators of the German-language series Dark , 1899 could be described as an attempt at data-driven wish-fulfillment based on the viewing habits of those who are looking for limited series with even more limited explanations .\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mystery without fitting snugly into either ; less of a high-tech whodunit and more of an existential \u201c What is happening ?\n\u201d and \u201c Why are we here ?\n\u201d Key plot structures or premises are not revealed until mid-way to as late as the end of a roughly 10-episode season arc .\nReality itself is an unreliable narrator , and its narratives are structured within framing stories or nesting dolls\u2014imagine a camera slowly zooming out on a set of intersecting lines that eventually resolve into the image of a maze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealing the maze is merely a puzzle piece in a larger , more complex structure .\nCombining the \u201c dream within a dream \u201d suspension of disbelief of Inception with the Turing tests of Westworld or The Matrix and the conspiracy theory lore of Lost , the risk of these series , for viewers and creators alike , is a cliffhanger cancellation or a rushed finale that never delivers answers to central questions .\nIt \u2019 s a hefty ask for writers and producers to avoid the pitfalls of predecessors and supply a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape room for television , perfectly paced for viewers to arrive at the coveted solution just in the nick of time .\nFor bo Odar and Friese , Dark seems to be the blueprint for success at a time when the meaning of success is undoubtedly evolving for Netflix .\nAs ad-supported subscriptions increase , the merit of a series will no longer lie solely in its ability to draw in new subscribers during a weekend or month of \u201c must-see \u201d buzz but its shelf-life over time and potential for repeat viewings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find ( according to Reddit ) a die-hard following after being cut short two seasons into a planned five season series was in its attention to detail .\nDespite a theory whose loyalty borders on religious fervor , claiming the cancellation was a meta publicity stunt , the amount of time that has passed makes it ever more unlikely that TV execs will bring the series back from the dead the same way Game of Thrones resurrected Jon Snow .\nBut this knowledge doesn \u2019 t deter viewers from combing through every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creator \u2019 s social media accounts , looking for answers .\nThe open-ended mystery has taken on a life of its own , akin to Byron Preiss \u2019 1982 treasure hunt The Secret or the CIA \u2019 s \u2018 Kryptos \u2019 cipher ; the allure of a puzzle is increased as its likelihood of ever being solved decreases .\nNetflix , however , seems to have learned from the backlash of The OA \u2019 s cancellation , including the hunger strikes and viewers-funded billboards that went with it .\nDark in many ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OA and was renewed each season until it delivered a powerful ending to its time-traveling , oedipal odyssey , proving that the solution of these puzzles can be as satisfactory as the expectations we have for them .\n1899 seems then , in turn , a promise to produce more of the same .\nA commitment to molding this evolving genre , which we might call metaphysical fiction , without pulling the rug out from under loyal viewers .\nIt feeds a demand for sophisticated writing from a global audience that is becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Squid Games ( 1899 touts an international cast and dialogue in English , German , Danish , Spanish , French , Portuguese , Polish , and Cantonese ) .\nThrow in some period costumes to tempt the Bridgerton crowd and it has all the makings of a hit on paper .\nTime and viewership data will ultimately tell .\nThe crowning glory of metaphysical fiction is its ability to transcend the very structures that draw its audiences in .\nWhen the symbols are explained and the camera has revealed its true subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning .\nThe OA spoke of survival through community in the face of trauma and evil , Dark \u2019 s resolution came in the form of self-sacrifice for the survival of family and friends , and 1899 , which promises even larger reveals if renewed , seems to center on the human need for connection as our most basic instinct and it \u2019 s strength to overcome man-made societal barriers as well as the isolation felt as the result of a reality we can never fully comprehend .\nHowever paradoxical it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repertoire that also includes Love Is Blind , it is promising , for those viewers looking for art in television , that their $ 15.49 a month ,

malignant narcissistic and psychopathic traits in people , before we get involved in relationships , friendships , or workplaces that harm us .\nA recent meta-analysis of over 400 studies revealed that narcissism is associated with all forms of aggression , including both reactive aggression and proactive ( unprovoked , premeditated ) aggression ( Kj\u00e6rvik & Bushman , 2021 ) .\nA wealth of research has also supported the fact that psychopathic traits are associated with cold-blooded , instrumental violence to meet one \u2019 s agendas ( e.g .\nGlenn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on research conducted on narcissism and psychopathy , as well as accounts from thousands of individuals involved in relationships with people high in these traits , there are five simple \u201c tests \u201d you can use to assess harmful behaviors in someone new you \u2019 re getting to know or even someone you \u2019 ve known for quite some time .\nWhile none of these on their own are necessarily indicative of any full-fledged disorder or any mental health diagnosis , if these behaviors are frequent , harmful , intense and show up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign you need to detach and protect yourself .\nKeep in mind that more covertly aggressive manipulators can hide these behaviors for a while before you \u2019 re sufficiently invested in a relationship with them , using techniques such as love bombing to hook you .\nHowever , these can still be helpful to weed out potentially in your social circle , relationships , friendships , and business partnerships over time .\nHere are five tests you can use to test for narcissistic or psychopathic traits in an individual\u2026 1 .\nSee how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates an association between malicious envy and the Dark Triad traits \u2013 narcissism , psychopathy , and Machiavellianism ( Lange et al.\n, 2016 ; Lange et al.\n, 2017 ) .\nWhile occasional jealousy and envy can be normal human emotions , narcissistic and psychopathic individuals escalate into sabotaging , stalking , harassing and belittling the individual that is their target .\nAccording to former FBI agent Joe Navarro , warning signs of narcissism can include a pathological sense of envy and competition .\nIn his book Dangerous Personalities , he lists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone new , share something you \u2019 re proud of and observe how they react .\nDo they shut you down and turn the attention back to themselves ?\nDo they covertly belittle or minimize your accomplishment , attempting to detract from your sense of achievement ?\nDo they extend congratulations or treat what you share with indifference and a haughty attitude of , \u201c So what ?\n\u201d Is there a mismatch between their nonverbal behavior and their words ?\nFor example , do they pretend to be happy for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger \u2013 only to later sabotage you ?\nThese are tell-tale signs you may be dealing with someone on the spectrum of narcissism .\nNormal , healthy people do not try to diminish what gives you joy or pride in life .\nThey are able to set any jealousy or envy they have aside and more often than not , feel happy for your success .\n2 .\nObserve their reactions to times when you are suffering .\nPerhaps one of the most defining traits of narcissism is a core lack of empathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and psychopathic individuals experience positive emotions when seeing sad faces ( Wai & Tiliopoulos , 2012 ) .\nWhen you are in need or extreme distress , a narcissist will usually exacerbate your pain or even abandon you .\nThis is very common when in a relationship with a sadistic narcissist .\nAs an author and researcher who has corresponded with thousands of survivors of narcissistic partners , friends , family members , and co-workers , I \u2019 ve heard countless stories from survivors who were abandoned by their narcissistic partners during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major surgery , after childbirth , or even during a life-threatening illness .\nTo test a narcissistic individual , ask them for a favor or see how they respond when you are in crisis .\nHow do they react when you most need them to comfort you ?\nDo they condescendingly treat you with indifference ?\nDo they discard you without a word or subject you to the silent treatment ?\nThere are some narcissists who will be able to fake empathy for a short period of time , but usually , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and abusive ways .\n3 .\nThrow out a personal disclosure .\nDo they use it as ammunition ?\nHealthy , empathic people will respect when you tell them something in confidence .\nMalignant narcissists or psychopathic individuals will use anything and everything you tell them against you , including your insecurities and deepest traumas .\nThey will tap into your greatest fears and make a mockery out of them in order to further gaslight you into believing you are the problem ( Stern , 2018 ) .\nThey have no limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if it inflicts enormous pain .\nAs Dr. Robert Hare , author of Without Conscience writes , \u201c The psychopath carries out his evaluation of a situation\u2014what he will get out of it and at what cost\u2014without the usual anxieties , doubts , and concerns about being humiliated , causing pain , sabotaging future plans , in short , the infinite possibilities that people of conscience consider when deliberating possible actions.\n\u201d If you want to test any kind of potential toxicity in someone , pretend to tell them something that \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this will be a trap which will act as bait \u2013 a red herring .\nTell them something insignificant \u2013 a small fear , insecurity , or disappointing experience \u2013 and see if they use it against you later on as a put-down , as an insult , as a form of gaslighting to discredit you , or as a verbal assault disguised as a \u201c joke.\n\u201d Some narcissistic individuals will even go out of their way to spread your personal information to others as gossip or slander .\nThis will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat your suffering in the future .\nIf they make fun of , degrade and gaslight you using this disclosure , you know everything you need to know about the character of this person .\nBoundaries are kryptonite to a narcissist , especially one who wants to fast-forward the relationship or disrespect you .\nAccording to manipulation expert Dr. George Simon , \u201c Aggressive personalities don \u2019 t like anyone pushing them to do what they don \u2019 t want to do or stopping them from doing what they want to do .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ they accept.\n\u201d Setting a boundary causes a narcissistic injury in toxic people and in some cases , might even result in aggression or violence ( Bushman & Thomaes , 2011 ) .\nWatch what happens when you set a boundary with a narcissist ( e.g .\nPlease don \u2019 t call me after midnight ) .\nDo they respect your wishes and back off ?\nOr do they persist even more with an excessive sense of entitlement ?\nPerhaps they pretend to understand your boundary but violate it time and time again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can reveal their true manipulative intentions .\n5 .\nExpress or assert yourself \u2013 and see how they respond .\nExpressing dissatisfaction ( even politely and respectfully ) to a narcissistic individual agitates them greatly .\nThis is due to what researchers call \u201c narcissistic rage , \u201d ( Theberge & Dominick , 2022 ) .\nSome narcissistic individuals can treat every perceived slight or criticism as a life-or-death threat and work to extinguish it with unprecedented vindictiveness .\nSee what happens when you ( authentically ) disagree with a narcissist \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a healthy way ( e.g .\nI don \u2019 t think the waiter was being mean at all , I feel you may have been a bit aggressive with him ) .\nA malignant narcissist will see even warranted feedback as a challenge to their perceived sense of superiority and will likely lash out in verbal abuse ( ex .\nYou \u2019 re an idiot if you think the waiter wasn \u2019 t mean ! )\n, gaslighting ( ex .\nYou have no idea what you \u2019 re talking about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or diversion tactics and accusations ( ex .\nYou \u2019 re only on his side because you were flirting with him ! )\n.\nMore covertly aggressive narcissists may be able to hide their rage but punish you later \u2013 for example , bringing up this incident in a future argument and using it to debase you .\nUse any of these five tests to detect whether or not someone you know may have malignant narcissistic traits that are harmful to you and detach accordingly .\nRemember , regardless of whether or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they can still be harmful to your mental health and well-being depending on the intensity of these behaviors and their willingness to change .\nThe higher they are on the narcissistic spectrum , the more likely they can engage in these behaviors with malice , entitlement , and a lack of empathy .\nIt \u2019 s important for you to make a safety plan and slow down before you invest in a toxic relationship .\nYour boundaries and self-care are paramount .\nAn earlier version of this article was first written

That Scare Men Off", "content": "The one thing I \u2019 ve noticed over the years as a relationship writer is that most women have no idea how they \u2019 re coming across to men .\nThey may do things in an attempt to win his affection and then are left completely baffled when their efforts produce the opposite result .\nI get a lot of heat when I write about what women are doing wrong .\nI get accused of blaming women , of defending men .\nBut I \u2019 m doing neither .\nMy job isn \u2019 t to excuse or blame , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have spent most of my life studying human behavior and using my insights to help people improve their lives and their relationships .\nA lot of what I learned came through devastating personal experiences , so I \u2019 m telling you all what I wish someone had told me sooner !\nThere is never a good reason to chase anything .\nAnd you will never have to chase that which is meant for you .\nThe vast majority of the time , if a guy likes you\u2026 he will do something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he \u2019 ll ask you out , and he will be consistent .\nNone of this in and out , hot and cold , sending so many mixed messages it makes your head spin .\nOnly guys who are somewhat interested act that way .\nIf he really likes you , the only thing you need to do is send a few greenlight signals his way so he knows you \u2019 re interested as well .\nThis does not need to be obvious and over the top .\nA sweet smile and sultry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a guy has the opportunity to be with you and he just doesn \u2019 t take it , then he just doesn \u2019 t like you enough .\nA high-value woman will just let him go and she \u2019 ll know that she \u2019 ll find someone else , someone better suited for her .\nA desperate woman will not let him go without a fight and she will claw her way back into his good graces- maybe she \u2019 ll text him nonstop , maybe she \u2019 ll show up places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe she \u2019 ll get intel from mutual friends , maybe she \u2019 ll stalk him endlessly on social media , she may even ask him out .\nThe guy may respond to her advances by being polite , and she may mistake this as him being somewhat interested , but he really doesn \u2019 t seem to reciprocate the feelings .\nHe may reply when you reach out , but he never initiates .\nYou basically end up in a passive-reciprocation loop and eventually the relationship withers away .\nIf there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , you will effectively kill it by chasing after him .\nNow I \u2019 m not saying you need to be totally passive here .\nYou can absolutely be bold when you feel like it .\nSometimes it can be sexy when a woman initiates .\nBut after that , she needs to leave it alone and give him some space to pursue her .\nThat is how men bond and develop feelings .\nThat is what causes them to invest .\nIf he doesn \u2019 t have the space to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one invested in this relationship .\nIt \u2019 s very easy to get swept away when a new guy is in the picture and he \u2019 s nice and normal and you get along and have fun together and you just can \u2019 t help but get so excited about where this could lead .\nBut when you do this , you \u2019 re usually investing in a fantasy more than an actual person .\nPutting someone on a pedestal is not flattering , it \u2019 s alarming .\nIt just feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserved .\nNo one is perfect , and we all know that .\nMost of us are deeply flawed in our own ways , so when someone idealizes us like this it just signals that something is off about them , like they are just getting carried away by a fantasy or an illusion .\nWhat we all crave as humans is a genuine connection .\nAnd you can \u2019 t connect on a real level if you aren \u2019 t seeing him as a real person .\nOne of the biggest turn-offs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts entitled and just expects him to do things .\nNow men do love a woman with high standards , but they still want to be appreciated for the things they do .\nThey don \u2019 t want a woman who just expects them to do certain things and be a certain way .\nOne of the most essential things to understand about men is that they crave appreciation greatly .\nThis is essentially every man \u2019 s core love language .\nIf a man doesn \u2019 t feel genuinely appreciated in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in that relationship .\nIf you act entitled and just expect things from him , he will immediately be put off and most likely won \u2019 t want to continue seeing you .\nYou can be a high-value woman with standards and boundaries and still show appreciation when a man makes an effort .\nAnd even more than that , men need to feel appreciated for who they are .\nIf you just see him as a means to an end\u2026 then you \u2019 re not connecting with him and he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force someone to love you or reciprocate certain feelings .\nIf he doesn \u2019 t seem to be matching your level of interest , stop obsessing over it and graciously let it go .\nDon \u2019 t stress over where it all went wrong or what you should have done differently .\nFocus on yourself , focus on being a better version of yourself .\nFocus on being happy and complete .\nFocus on feeling great about your life and about who you are .\nThis is what really captures a man \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trying to do anything in your power to win him over .\nWorrying sucks the joy out of a relationship and creates a tense , uneasy environment .\nSomething like 90 % of communication is nonverbal .\nSo you may verbally be saying all the right things , but if you \u2019 re worrying and stressing over the relationship , he will pick up on that nervous energy and it \u2019 s a turn-off .\nThen all of a sudden he \u2019 ll say he feels like something is \u201c off \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just won \u2019 t feel attracted to you anymore .\nRelationships really aren \u2019 t that complicated .\nThe problem is we make them complicated by creating problems that don \u2019 t exist and obsessing over how to solve them .\nActing like you \u2019 re in a relationship will not get you a relationship , it will just put an end to whatever you have going on .\nHere is how this scenario usually goes down .\nGirl meets boy , girl really , really likes boy , girl cuts off all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy even though they never decided to be exclusive .\nBoy tells girl \u201c I like our relationship as it is and don \u2019 t want to label it \u201d and girl is devastated but stays in the relationship anyway , hoping he \u2019 ll change his mind .\nYes , it can be difficult to keep your options open when you find a guy who shines so much brighter than the rest , but you can not act like his girlfriend until you are his girlfriend .\nWhy ?\nBecause when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , you come to care for him way more than he cares for you , and then you \u2019 re the one left shattered and devastated when it ends .\nAlso , when you commit too soon you just put pressure on the situation and it suffocates the joy and excitement that was there before .\nHe may feel like now you \u2019 re expecting too much from him , more than he \u2019 s ready to give at this exact moment , and then he \u2019 ll start pulling away or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too soon , you run the risk of scaring him away ( as I mentioned previously , it \u2019 s alarming when someone becomes so into us before they really know us ) , and he also won \u2019 t feel like he \u2019 s choosing you , he \u2019 ll feel like he \u2019 s being chased and our immediate instinct when something is chasing us is to run .\nOne of the biggest driving needs for a man when it comes to relationships is being able to make a woman happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t , he won \u2019 t want to be with her .\nNo man wants to serve as his woman \u2019 s emotional dumping ground , it just adds more stress to his life and men are very drama-averse .\nBeing negative isn \u2019 t just a man-repeller , it \u2019 s a people-repeller .\nNo one wants to be sucked into that energy .\nPractice being grateful for what you have in life .\nIf you want to complain , you will always find things to complain about .\nIf you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can always find things in your life to feel grateful for .\nI \u2019 ll admit , I \u2019 m a talker .\nIt took me a while to learn the art of just shutting up and listening .\nNow some of this comes from feeling misunderstood like you need to overexplain yourself ( this is usually tied to not feeling heard as a child ) .\nSome of it is a feeling of needing to prove yourself .\nSo on a date , you may talk and talk and talk endlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him about how funny you are , how successful you are , how many friends you have , how well-traveled you are , what a wonderful life you have\u2026 then how is he going to know ?\n!\nThis is problematic because first , it \u2019 s exhausting for the other person to listen to , and also , it can backfire .\nIf you put on a whole song and dance about how great you are , you may come across as arrogant , and also , he may feel like he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people don \u2019 t typically become interested in you when you show them how interesting you are\u2026 they become interested when you show a genuine interest in them .\nAnd of course , all this talking and proving yourself just reeks of desperation .\nIf you feel worthy and confident in yourself , you will trust that this person will be genuinely curious to learn more about you , and that he will discover all the facets of your over time .\nYou won \u2019 t worry that you \u2019 re not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him that you are more than enough and then some by going on and on .", "author": "Sabrina Bendory", "url":

"content": "When a man starts to pull away or withdraw , a lot of women reflexively panic and do what they can to bring him back and get the relationship back on track .\nTheir intentions are good , but most of the time they inadvertently make the situation worse and push him even further away .\nIt is a crushing , miserable feeling .\nYou feel powerless and scared and have no idea what the right move is .\nEverything seemed to be going so well but now something is off .\nMaybe he doesn \u2019 t text as often\u2026 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you or the relationship\u2026or maybe it \u2019 s nothing you can put your finger on , just a feeling in the pit of your stomach .\nSo what now ?\nI \u2019 m going to tell you exactly what NOT to do when he \u2019 s pulling away .\nFirst , let \u2019 s address why this happens .\nThere are two primary reasons a man will pull away 1 .\nHe \u2019 s dealing with something and just needs space to work through it .\nIt could be something at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family issues\u2026 whatever the case , he \u2019 s stressed and emotionally overwhelmed and wants to deal with it on his own .\nThis is a common male response to stress .\n2 .\nHe is losing interest in you ( this is the nightmare scenario women fear ) .\nIt \u2019 s important to correctly identify which is which , but if you don \u2019 t know , it \u2019 s better to assume he needs space to work out his own emotions , this way you don \u2019 t make things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to cycle between wanting to get close and wanting to spend time on their own .\nThis actually makes for a healthy relationship .\nIf one person has a more insecure or anxious attachment style , they may have a hard time when their partner pulls away and then it becomes a relationship problem .\nOK , so

thinks maybe if he re-discovers how amazing she is , then he \u2019 ll come back .\nShe is extra attentive , goes above and beyond , and tries to be what she thinks he wants .\nThis is useless for

annoyed with you and will pull away further .\nWhen you try to win him over , you are essentially lowering your own value , you \u2019 re saying \u201c I \u2019 m not worthy of you , but I hope you \u2019 ll pick me anyway !\n\u201d Now would you want to date someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exactly .\nWhen you \u2019 re in this headspace you send out a desperate vibe that he will pick up on .\nEven the most obtuse , most emotionally oblivious men can pick up on vibes because more than 90 % of communication is non-verbal .\nStop putting mental energy into figuring out what he \u2019 s thinking , how he \u2019 s feeling , if he \u2019 s losing interest in you , and so on .\nSpend that time literally doing anything else , anything .\nWorrying about how he feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all areas of life : when has worrying about something ever lead to a good place ?\nYou have better things to do with your time than stress .\nSo go do anything else .\nRead , write , go for a run , a swim , a bike ride , go shopping , go to the spa , go out with your girlfriends for a drink , just do something fun that you enjoy and that makes you happy .\nThe way to reignite a man \u2019 s interest is actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing interesting about a woman who is desperate for a man and pining away for him .\nWhat captivates a man \u2019 s attention is a woman who can be happy on her own and doesn \u2019 t need a man in order to feel good about herself .\nThe biggest mistake is to cling to him even tighter and shower him with love and affection to reel him back in .\nThis is the opposite of what he needs .\nHe \u2019 s taking space because that \u2019 s what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon us , for instance , you putting your need for closeness above his need for space , it just makes us resent them .\nPeople who are emotionally mature are able to give their partner what they need , even if this is counter to what they want .\nDon \u2019 t smother him , don \u2019 t beg him to talk to you , don \u2019 t make demands or ultimatums .\nRespect what he needs and do yourself and your relationship a favor by working on your own happiness during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will feel a lot of emotions , one of the most poisonous of which is anger .\nAnger destroys everything it touches .\nYes , you \u2019 re hurt , you feel neglected , and you \u2019 re uncertain of what \u2019 s going on .\nBut realize a lot of this is self-generated and not necessarily his fault .\nHe doesn \u2019 t owe you 100 % of his time and attention .\nAnd it \u2019 s not his fault if you get upset because he needs to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be compassionate , and understand he \u2019 s doing something that is natural and necessary for him .\nIf the feelings reach a boiling point and you can \u2019 t contain them , then you can speak to him about it but be mindful of how you come at him .\nIt \u2019 s not usually what we say , but the way we say it , that causes conflict .\nDon \u2019 t come at him with blame and accusations .\nJust tell him where you \u2019 re coming from .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of react .\nWhen you respond , you have a choice .\nYou take in all the information and decide what the best course of action is .\nWhen you react , you \u2019 re a slave to your emotions and you usually say things you regret .\nI know it can feel personal , but it really isn \u2019 t .\nSome men have a much harder time processing and handling emotions than women do .\nThey don \u2019 t have the same kinds of support systems , and sharing their innermost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come naturally to them .\nFor him , escaping from his feelings temporarily is sometimes more beneficial than trying to sort through them .\nTry to tap into your empathy rather than leaning into the anger .\nThe way to not worry about this is to just be OK with the outcome no matter what .\nEither he \u2019 ll get a handle on whatever is going on and he \u2019 ll come back better than ever\u2026 or he \u2019 ll won \u2019 t be back and all that means is he isn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that \u2019 s not a loss .\nHe just realized that this relationship wouldn \u2019 t work out , and yes , it \u2019 s hard that he came to that realization before you did , but it \u2019 s also a good thing .\nIt means he spared you from wasting more of your precious time , spared you from being strung along .\nIf you suspect he \u2019 s losing interest in you , the worst thing you can do is panic about it .\nThat just won \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put your hand on your heart and say , \u201c I will be OK no matter what.\n\u201d Spend a few moments taking some deep breaths and really letting that sink in .\nThe most important thing you can do when your guy is withdrawing or pulling away is just give him some space ( but space has a limit , this can \u2019 t

waiting for your turn to speak .\nNotice when you \u2019 re proving yourself and stop because you have nothing to prove .\nIf he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he \u2019 ll see your worth , it won \u2019 t need to be spelled out for him .\nAnd above all , instead of getting so caught up in how he feels about you , focus on this : is he good enough for me ?\nWhen you do that , you make a shift and instead of being a chaser , you become a chooser .\nI am not saying you can \u2019 t or shouldn \u2019 t ever initiate or make a move .\nYou can show interest.. but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s a guy you like and you text him asking him to hang out and he says he \u2019 ll get back to you later that day\u2026 and later that day comes around and you haven \u2019 t heard from him and you wonder if you should follow up\u2026 don \u2019 t !\nYou planted the seed , now let him do some work .\nDon \u2019 t always be the one to initiate texts or dates \u2026 a man will never have the space to care for you and invest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work .\nBeing too aggressive is just a turn-off , and this is on both sides , it \u2019 s a turn-off when men do it as well .\nIt may have served you well in your career , but when it comes to your love life , you shouldn \u2019 t ever have to go after someone so fervently .\nThe right person for you doesn \u2019 t need to be backed into a corner .\nAlso , when you are always the one to initiate you can fall into the passive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman reaches out to the man the majority of the time.. and he always replies , and he \u2019 s nice and maybe even flirty .\nShe may also ask him to hang out\u2026 and he \u2019 ll agree !\nAnd they probably have a nice time , they may even hook up .\nNow the woman thinks that he must have feelings for her\u2026 because why would he reply otherwise ?\nWhy would he hang out with her ?\nHowever , unless she reaches out to him , she basically won \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just passively reciprocating her advances and the reason is that he does kind of like her\u2026 he just doesn \u2019 t like her enough to want to be with her , because if he did , he would do something about it !\nIf you stop initiating , you probably just won \u2019 t hear from him anymore , or maybe he \u2019 ll hit you up every few months when he \u2019 s bored or horny or wants a nice ego boost .\nThis may confuse you , you may think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened is by you always initiating and reaching out , you kind of forced a relationship that otherwise wouldn \u2019 t have existed because he was never all that interested .\n3 .\nYou have an agenda .\nThis is the biggest area that trips women up .\nWhen you have an agenda , you can \u2019 t just enjoy the relationship for what it is , you need it to move in a certain direction in order to feel OK. For example , let \u2019 s say you want a committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your goal .\nWhen you have a goal , you can \u2019 t form a meaningful connection with the guy because every interaction is measured in terms of whether it takes you closer to or further from your goal .\nIf he texts you a lot one day , great !\nHe \u2019 s clearly thinking about you a lot .\nOne step closer to the goal .\nIf he goes a day or two without texting you , then you \u2019 ve gone backward .\nAnd when you go backward you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him like an object- he is a means to an end .\nYou can \u2019 t really be present and form a connection with him because you \u2019 re interacting with the worried thoughts in your own mind- how does he feel about me ?\nWas I too insecure the other day ?\nIs he serious about me ?\nDid I sound too desperate when I texted him 4 times in a row yesterday ?\nDoes he seem excited by me right now ?\nDoes he look bored on this date ?\nIs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over ?\nShould I ?\nOr should I make him wait ?\nHow can I make him want me ?\nYou basically view him as a reflection of you , a representation of your worth and worthiness .\nSuffice it to say this isn \u2019 t a healthy attitude , it \u2019 s a desperate one .\nAnd he will pick up on this energy and he will be turned off .\nRather than worrying and wondering , try to just be in the moment and enjoy it .\n4 .\nYou post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise out of him .\nIf your entire social media strategy these days is only posting things to elicit a reaction from you\u2026 then you are being way too desperate .\nWatch it with the thirst traps and the posts about how amazing you are and how amazing your life is\u2026 people who actually feel this way don \u2019 t typically feel the need to post about it .\nTrying to get a rise out of him via your social media looks like him blowing you off one night\u2026 then you going out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you out and about and having the time of your life to really show him who \u2019 s boss !\nThere is nothing wrong with posting after a night out , but you just need to be aware of your intention .\nIf you \u2019 re trying to spark a certain reaction in a certain person , it \u2019 s coming from a desperate place .\nGuys know when you \u2019 re playing games and they are not into it .\nIt can be a little fun and exciting at first , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s the thing about \u201c games.\n\u201d The only reason they sort of work and the reason the idea took hold is that playing games creates the illusion of confidence .\nYou follow certain rules , like making him wait before texting him back , to make it seem like you are a busy , in-demand woman .\nBut if you aren \u2019 t actually\u2026 then your true self is going to emerge eventually !\nAnd then what ?\nThat \u2019 s why games can be effective at capturing a man \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t really help you sustain a relationship .\nPlaying games points to insecurity and immaturity .\nIt comes from a place of feeling like your true self isn \u2019 t enough so you need to act like someone else .\nA better strategy is to focus on being that confident , high-value woman , rather than pretending to be .\nDon \u2019 t play hard to get , be hard to get .\nYou get there by having standards , having boundaries , knowing what you will and won \u2019 t accept , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one that is so fulfilling that having a guy is a nice addition , not necessarily a vital piece of the puzzle .", "author": "Sabrina Bendory", "url":

of what \u2019 s really going on and how to fix it .\nFirst , let \u2019 s just talk about what neediness is .\nI think when we hear the term neediness we think of Kate Hudson \u2019 s character Andy Anderson in \u201c How to Lose a Guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clingy , crazy woman making a fool of herself in pursuit of the man she loves .\nBut neediness is not a set of behaviors , it \u2019 s a mindset .\nA mindset that poisons everything The needy mindset is \u201c I am not OK and I need you to respond to me in a certain way in order to feel OK. And if you don \u2019 t , you will suffer.\n\u201d How it manifests is a woman is seeing a guy , things are going well , then she really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she starts to worry that he won \u2019 t reciprocate .\nOr maybe he does something that triggers these feelings in her , maybe he becomes less available ( and even if this has nothing to do with her , she takes it personally ) , maybe he \u2019 s less responsive , maybe he isn \u2019 t taking as much initiative .\nWhen a woman has a low opinion of herself , she doesn \u2019 t trust that things will work out for her .\nNow all of a sudden she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she just feels anxious and on edge , she \u2019 s always looking for signs that he \u2019 s losing interest , waiting for the other shoe to drop\u2026 waiting to be ghosted or broken up with because deep down , she doesn \u2019 t think she \u2019 ll get the love she wants .\nAfter these feelings build up over time , she snaps .\nMaybe he takes too long to text her back one day and she notices he \u2019 s been active on social media\u2026 which means he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choosing not to reply to her , and then she snaps .\nShe comes at him with a barrage of angry texts and now all of a sudden this guy is like , Woah , what \u2019 s going on here ?\nHe feels a little put off , so maybe he \u2019 s taking a little space and she takes this as a sign that he has lost interest so now she \u2019 s beating herself up over the fact that she acted too needy and she vows she \u2019 ll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , and if things do get back on track , she is walking on eggshells because she \u2019 s too scared to be that need girl again When a man feels that energy coming from a woman early in a relationship , it feels like coercion \u2013 he either has to give in and act how you want him to act or deal with you being upset .\nFor example , he can \u2019 t just focus on work because he has to worry that if you text him and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t respond right away , he \u2019 s going to have to deal with you being upset So what do you do about it ?\nFirst \u2014 don \u2019 t apologize .\nIt won \u2019 t get you anywhere , it won \u2019 t erase anything in his mind .\nMen hear actions louder than words .\nIf you did something really egregious or maybe you blew up at him in your needy state , then sure , apologize , but then move past it .\nDon \u2019 t keep having conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting needy .\nJust turn it around .\nNow that \u2019 s easier said than done .\nYou need to get to the heart of the neediness .\n\u2022 None What am I so afraid of ?\n\u2022 None Where is this fear coming from ?\n\u2022 None How can I find fulfillment in my life so I \u2019 m not relying on him to give it to me ?\n\u2022 None What will happen if this relationship doesn \u2019 t work out ?\nMaybe the thought of losing him terrifies you\u2026 so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that so scary ?\nWhat will that mean to you ?\nAnd if he does leave\u2026 what will happen ?\nAfter the sadness and despair , you will pick yourself up and move on and you will be OK. That \u2019 s what you need to remember .\nNext , make a plan for how you will go about having a more fulfilling life .\nThis will increase your feelings of self-esteem and will stop you from relying so heavily on a relationship to fill you up .\nThe obsession grows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional void , you will outsource the task of filling it to others .\nBut no one can give you things like self-worth or even happiness .\nThese things come from within .\nNeediness is caused by not feeling OK , but feeling like something essential is missing .\nSo try to give yourself those missing ingredients .\nA good place to start is asking yourself : what does my ideal day look like ?\nWhat time do you wake up ?\nWho do you hang out with ?\nWhat do you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visualize your perfect day from start to finish .\nAnd then try to incorporate elements of your ideal day into your daily life as much as you can .\nI know it \u2019 s not always easy to fit in these things because

we need to look within- why do I feel this pull toward him ?\nWhy do I not feel OK unless I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fulfilling for me ?\nLook inward at yourself and start doing the work .\nFocus on filling

flooded me in the months to come included guilt , shame , and an unbearable depression that society told me I should feel after contracting an STI .\nI thought women weren \u2019 t affected by HIV ?\nWhat if I give it to another person ?\nWho would love somebody with this much baggage ?\nQuestions like this haunted my every waking moment .\nBefore I grasped the concept that an STI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I would be permanently labeled a toxic hazard and an embarrassment to my loved ones , as this had been the narrative surrounding any STI diagnosis for the past two decades .\nThe notion that HIV only affected gay men was still prevalent during this time so finding accurate information , woman-based support groups and general acceptance was difficult , to say the least .\nAlthough I was repeatedly told by my doctors that once I started medication , I would be undetectable which meant I could not transmit the virus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still feared the stigma .\nAs a young woman , I felt lost and alone in a world unforgiving to this normal human circumstance .\nI felt my identity and sexuality had been stripped away by the antiquated stigma that surrounded HIV .\nLittle did I know a major shift was about to emerge from this darkness .\nSomewhere between bouts of screaming into my pillow , failed attempts at dating , and tireless nights of research , a new realization blossomed for me , particularly through spirituality .\nI am still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever .\nThe anxiety and depression I incurred led me to meditation , natural medicine , breathwork , and manifestation to name a few .\nWith these modalities , I came to the realization that STIs do not define us and that they shouldn \u2019 t deter anyone from living a juicy and fulfilling life .\nI can say now , five years later , that all those false beliefs were the farthest thing from my truth .\nThat truth is that I am thriving .\nWhile I understand the following claim may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved my life from an unfulfilling path I didn \u2019 t even know I was on .\nWithout it , I don \u2019 t believe I would have found spirituality , nor would I have gained the knowledge women like me once lacked .\nThis virus has shown me that my purpose on this planet is to simply bring healing to others .\nTo provide all who are dealing with grief the tools and confidence to be vibrant , sexual , and empowered beings .\nI have made it my mission to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living with the disease can flourish .\nI now use social media to shed light on the fact that HIV has no bias , it can affect anyone who has sex , regardless of class , frequency of sex , or gender but most importantly , pushing the narrative that STIs don \u2019 t define you !\nNormalcy is attainable after diagnosis ; I know this because I live it every day .\nSharing my experience , providing hope to the hopeless , and living to my fullest expression has brought me so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who come to me for support .\nThis disease gave meaning to the saying \u201c make your mess your medicine.\n\u201d The gratitude I have for my mess is insurmountable and I can \u2019 t wait to share it with the world .\nWe only have one chance at

.\nYou can \u2019 t just be present and connect with him .\nYou \u2019 re weighing everything you say .\nYou \u2019 re writing and re-writing texts and sending them to your girlfriends for approval

communicate to him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be some kind of life-preserver or crutch or key to being happy , he will definitely not want to pursue a relationship .\nAlso , when you try to win someone over ,

have is the potential of what could be .\nDating is merely a discovery process , it \u2019 s not a measure of your worth or worthiness .\nSo what looks and feels like him losing interest , is really just him discovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you notice that guys keep disappearing on you and every guy you date seems to be a \u201c commitment-phobe , it may be time to take a closer look at who you are

here .\nI understand that you and he have crazy chemistry ( side note : the chemistry you feel with a guy you can \u2019 t have is made up mostly of the anxiety and fears he arouses within you ,

Your Life", "content": "Breakups are hard enough , but when your ex keeps coming back but doesn \u2019 t seem to want you back it can be crushing .\nIt could be an ex-boyfriend or an ex-situation-whatever , either way it hurts and it messes with your mind .\nMaybe he starts commenting on your social media accounts , maybe he shoots you friendly texts once in a while , maybe he wants to go out for coffee and catch up .\nIf you give in when he wants to talk or see you , then you may be in a devastating cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to get back together , only to experience to crushing blow of rejection once again when he either disappears or tells you he doesn \u2019 t want to try again .\nBut then why ?\nWhy does he keep coming back ?\nSurely it has to mean something !\nA lot of women will make the mistake of thinking he keeps coming back because they \u2019 re meant to be , because he really is her soulmate or twin flame and just can \u2019 t live without her ( and to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was truly meant to be with you then he would actually be with you ! )\n.\nThis is the truth about why he keeps coming back into your life : 1 .\nHe doesn \u2019 t want to feel like the bad guy .\nNo guy , at least no normal , emotionally healthy guy , makes it a goal to break a woman \u2019 s heart .\nHe doesn \u2019 t want to hurt you , he wants to believe you \u2019 re on the same page as him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nA very long time ago , during my single days , I met a really hot guy who also happened to be really smart and nice , a jackpot !\nAnd he was super into me right away .\nAnd given that things never ever seemed to work out the way I wanted , I figured the universe was finally throwing me a bone and I was getting what I deserved after so many years of heartache and rejection .\nWe went on a few dates and while we had fun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t a match .\nHe was still very much in his \u201c frat boy \u201d era even though he had long since graduated , and I was in my late twenties and dating more seriously .\nIt wasn \u2019 t just about having fun , I wanted to find someone I could get serious with .\nI knew the truth , but he was just so hot I decided to ignore it and keep going , but then he not so surprisingly ghosted me .\nEven though I saw it coming , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show must go on .\nWeeks went by and then I randomly ran into him on the streets of NYC ( it \u2019 s always hard not to think of things as being meant to be when that happens , because seriously \u2014 what are the odds ?\n! )\n.\nNow if I could go back in time and redo this moment , I would have just been cool and collected , I would have given him a friendly hello and been on my way .\nBut that \u2019 s not what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desperate need to win him over , to get things back on track .\nAfter some flirty and friendly banter , I invited him to a happy hour thing I was going to later that week .\nHe showed up , I tried to get him back , and I failed and felt like an idiot .\nA few months go by and then he randomly texted me wishing me happy holidays .\nI immediately thought this meant he was interested in me again , that he had lingering feelings that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , nothing came of it .\nBut he would still shoot me friendly texts here and there .\nAnd I would usually reply enthusiastically and then the conversation would die off .\nSo what was his deal ?\nWell , I did run into him a few times at different events about a year after our \u201c relationship \u201d and I learned he \u2019 s just a really nice guy .\nI didn \u2019 t really pay attention to that part when were dating because I was so focused on getting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just kind of a sweet little puppy and I think he just didn \u2019 t want to feel like the bad guy by ghosting a girl .\nSo in his mind , he wasn \u2019 t really ghosting because he was still texting me on occasion .\nAnd I \u2019 m not giving him a total pass here .\nWhat he did was immature , but as I said , he was still in his frat boy era .\nAnd I don \u2019 t think he realized that he was giving me false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuinely think he thought it was the kind thing to do , he didn \u2019 t want me to feel like I was just discarded .\nNo guy ever wants to feel like the bad guy .\nNo guy is bragging to his friends about the girl he just ghosted .\nDesire , attraction , and feelings of liking or loving someone are complex , these things don \u2019 t turn on and off like a light switch .\nIt \u2019 s possible he \u2019 s reaching out because he genuinely misses you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that doesn \u2019 t mean he wants to get back together with you .\nA coaching client of mine was going through a pretty amicable breakup .\nBasically , she was taking her guy for granted , he was fed up and broke up with her .\nHe didn \u2019 t feel like he was what she wanted , he always felt inferior , like his true self wasn \u2019 t good enough .\nShe realized the value of what she had as soon as he no longer had it and was desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her best but he wasn \u2019 t budging and it was clear he never would , his mind was set .\nShe started to move on , but every few months he would resurface and text her something that punctured her fragile heart all over again .\nHe would text song lyrics about lost love , and happy memories they shared , or say devastating things like : \u201c I never loved anyone as much as you.\n\u201d But it \u2019 s not because he had a change of heart , it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes his emotions would override his better judgment .\nMatters of the heart are rarely black and white .\nIt \u2019 s not as simple as , \u201c I don \u2019 t want to be with you and so I no longer want anything to do with you.\n\u201d You can recognize that someone isn \u2019 t the right person but still miss a lot of things about that person .\n3 .\nHe wants to hook up\u2026 People have needs\u2026 sometimes selfish needs .\nAnd if you hear from him from time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then don \u2019 t hear from him again until he calls you one day and wants to hook up\u2026 well then you have your answer as to why he keeps coming back !\nThis is an easy trap to fall into when it \u2019 s a relationship with explosive chemistry but not much else to stand on .\nChemistry is important , but it can never compensate for fundamental compatibility .\nIt feels good to be wanted and desired , very good .\nAnd sometimes our egos need that fuel of knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 m sure he has lingering feelings as well , but if he \u2019 s reaching out to you mostly to gauge how you feel about him , then he \u2019 s most likely just looking for a nice ego-stroking .\nThere is comfort in the familiar even if we know the familiar isn \u2019 t right for us .\nOur hearts and minds will always pull us toward the familiar .\nMost people do the same things every morning , think the same thoughts throughout the day , ascribe the same meanings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same types of people , usually those who feel familiar and mirror qualities of important figures in our past .\nWe \u2019 re creatures of habit .\nIt \u2019 s especially likely he \u2019 s coming back out of comfort or familiarity if it was a long-term relationship or if he doesn \u2019 t have much else going on in his life and he feels the gaping hole of the space you left behind .\n6 .\nHe has an avoidant attachment style .\nNow here \u2019 s the tricky thing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 re there and available , they may feel the need to run or pull away .\nBut as soon as you \u2019 re not there , he feels a pull toward you .\nIf you \u2019 re in an on-again-off-again cycle with someone who has an avoidant attachment style , it \u2019 s possible that he doesn \u2019 t really know what he wants or how to manage his needs .\nAttachment styles can be managed but it requires emotional maturity to do so .\nIf he breaks up with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawling back when he craves closeness again , then his attachment style is running the show and he needs to get a better grip on it .\nIt is possible to have a relationship with someone who is avoidantly attached but they need to learn to express what they need instead of shutting you out .\nHe needs to learn to say , \u201c I need some space \u201d instead of ghosting you or breaking up with you when it feels like too much .\n7 .\nHe still likes you\u2026 he just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is usually the most confusing of all .\nHe has feelings for you , they just aren \u2019 t strong enough .\nUsually , this happens after a \u201c situationship.\n\u201d He either ends things or ghosts\u2026 you \u2019 re devastated , but then he keeps coming back and giving you false hope .\nThe reason is he does like you\u2026 he does find you cool and attractive and fun and interesting\u2026 he just doesn \u2019 t like you enough to want to be in a relationship with you .\nNow let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you \u2019 re in a situation with a guy who just won \u2019 t let you go .\nFirst , instead of being mad that he keeps coming back , ask yourself why you keep allowing it .\nIt \u2019 s easy to cut someone out of your life , you can just ignore him or block him .\nBut you \u2019 re not doing that .\nSo ask yourself why .\nWhy are you allowing him to toy with your emotions like this ?\nWhy do you still have hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re allowing him back into your life , he \u2019 s most likely scratching an itch or meeting some sort of need , be it a conscious or unconscious one .\nGet to the root of it .\nThe fact is , we teach the world how to treat us .\nIf you \u2019 re allowing him to treat you as a backup option or as some girl he texts when he \u2019 s bored , then you can \u2019 t really blame him .\nHe \u2019 s only living up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNext , ask yourself : do I really want to be with this man ?\nSometimes we get caught up in the ego fuel , in the attention , in the drama of it all .\nThat was the case for me with the sweet puppy boy\u2026 he was a nice distraction .\nI was so caught up in trying to get him to like me that I wasn \u2019 t really asking whether I wanted to be with him .\nAnd deep down I knew it wasn \u2019 t going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t want to think about that .\nNow if you \u2019 ve decided that he is the right man for you , and that you do want to give this another chance\u2026 that \u2019 s fine , but you need to realize that he also has to be on board in order for that to happen .\nAnd to find out where his head is at , you \u2019 re going to have to be a little vulnerable and put yourself out there and say .\nSay something along the lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I want to give this a chance \u201d and see what he says .\nIf you get vague , non-answers , then that \u2019 s your answer .\nDon \u2019 t be seduced by the \u201c maybes , \u201d if it \u2019 s not a sure thing , then you have to let go and move on\u2026 or continue to torture yourself , it \u2019 s your life !\nYou get one life , and if someone is ruining your ability to enjoy that life and they aren \u2019 t treating you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be treated , then you have to love yourself enough to let them go fully .", "author": "Sabrina Bendory", "url": "https://thoughtcatalog.com/sabrina-bendory/2022/12/why-he-keeps-coming-back-into-your-life/",

can be brutal\u2026 and the pain is often worse than the pain following a long-term relationship .\nBut why ?\nWhy does it so hard to let go of something you never truly had ?\nWhy does it feel like such an immense loss ?\nWhy are you still stuck in this obsessive , spiral cycle ?\nWell\u2026 .\nWhen you \u2019 re in a situationship , you \u2019 re basically dating potential .\nAnd when it ends , it \u2019 s the death of that potential , it \u2019 s the death of what could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to reconcile .\nMaybe you met someone that loves to travel and go to music festivals and you love to travel and go to music festivals !\nAnd you get so excited about the potential for this fun , exciting , adventurous time you \u2019 ll spend together , and it \u2019 s exhilarating to get caught in that fantasy .\nAnd when it ends before it even really begins , well you \u2019 re mourning the loss of something you never even had\u2026 what \u2019 s worse , you \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reality can never compare to a fantasy !\nYou don \u2019 t know what it really would have looked like because you never got to the point where you were going on adventures and traveling together\u2026 and you don \u2019 t know what that would have looked like .\nIt could have been a total disaster .\nYou just don \u2019 t know and you can \u2019 t know .\nAnd instead of thinking about what could have gone wrong , you can \u2019 t let go of this vision of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are attached to an idealized fantasy , not to any sort of reality .\nIt also hurts that he didn \u2019 t even want to try .\nIn a long-term relationship , you were there , he was there , you tried , he tried\u2026 and you experienced the breakdown and demise of the relationship .\nIn a situationship\u2026 it hurts so much more that he didn \u2019 t even want to try .\nIt hurts that he didn \u2019 t want to step up and match your desire to give this a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard not to take this sort of thing personally : I \u2019 m not even worth fighting for ?\nHe didn \u2019 t even want to give it more time to see what was there ?\nIt \u2019 s also important to realize that whoever this man was in the situationship isn \u2019 t the real him .\nWhat you saw was the best of him , because we \u2019 re all on our best behavior in the beginning !\nThe beginning of a relationship is just an illusion\u2026 it can feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you don \u2019 t really know them yet .\nAnd when it ends before you really got the chance to know him , it leaves all these gaps for you to fill in .\nAnd you can create this dream man in your mind that may or may not even exist and that \u2019 s the person you \u2019 re pining for .\nMore than being mad at him or the situation , you \u2019 re mad at yourself .\nYou feel like you can \u2019 t trust your own judgment anymore because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so are you delusional ?\nHow did you not see this coming ?\nRecognizing what \u2019 s happening can help you start to get over it and here are some more tips : This just wasn \u2019 t your person .\nI know you thought he could be , but he \u2019 s not because the right person for you wants to be with you .\nIf this guy cut out before you were even in it , then he was never invested enough in the first place .\nAnd trust me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone is a match and that \u2019 s OK. Is it possible that it \u2019 s just bad timing ?\nSure , but it isn \u2019 t a good idea for you to just wait around for him to choose you .\nThis is an incredibly disempowering place to be and can cause you to waste months or years of your life .\nIf he lets you go , you just have to let him .\n2 .\nBe kind to yourself .\nI know you feel stupid for being so sad over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYour hurt is valid , it \u2019 s more than valid !\nIt \u2019 s a loss , and a loss is painful .\nYou got excited about something and then disappointed when it wasn \u2019 t what you thought .\nWho wouldn \u2019 t be hurt by that ?\nIt \u2019 s not what happens to us but rather the stories we tell ourselves about what happens that determines whether we suffer or grow .\nIf you tell yourself , \u201c This happened because I \u2019 m unworthy and I \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want in life \u201d \u2026 well then that becomes wired in and now it \u2019 s a part of your story , and feeling this way will create that as your reality .\nAn alternative : \u201c It didn \u2019 t work out with this guy because he \u2019 s not right for me , not because there is something wrong with me.\n\u201d Every disappointment is a chance to learn and grow , so what did you learn here ?\nYou felt an intense pull toward that person for a reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent to you ?\nWhat needs was he fulfilling ?\nWhat void was he plugging up ?\nWhenever we feel an intense , consuming attraction , it \u2019 s usually more about us than it is about the other person .\nMaybe you \u2019 re drawn to him because he \u2019 s cool , confident , and charismatic and you wish you were more cool , confident , and charismatic .\nOK , then log that in as a data point about yourself and try to find ways to be that person on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ex who broke your heart and dating someone similar feels like a way to heal .\nMaybe he was insanely hot and growing up the hot guys never wanted you and you internalized that to believe you were a loser and now a hot guy wants you and it \u2019 s validating and addicting .\nMaybe he represents unhealed trauma .\nWhat did you think he could heal within you ?\nMaybe he represents the familiar\u2026 he was emotionally distant in the same way your caregivers were emotionally distant and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what feels familiar .\nAlso- does this guy represent a pattern of yours ?\nDo you always seem to go for the same kinds of guys , and end up in the same sorts of situationships that seem to end in the same ways ?\nThis isn \u2019 t a conspiracy against you .\nIf your dating life feels like Groundhog \u2019 s Day , it means there is a lesson you need to learn\u2026 and you \u2019 ll keep ending up in the same situations until you learn it !\nMaybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe you \u2019 re just bored in your life , maybe you have nothing going on , and you \u2019 re obsessing over him because you don \u2019 t have much else to focus on .\nReally look at yourself and your life and examine what took you to this place and how you can come out of it even better and stronger .\nObsession grows in vacant space .\nIf you keep thinking about him and what went wrong and what you did to cause this , you need to stop .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there just wasn \u2019 t enough there to sustain a relationship .\nInstead of dwelling on it , redirect your focus onto something else .\nFill up your time and your life with things you love and things that bring you joy .\nTry to give to others in any way you can- maybe by volunteering or just by being there for a friend or family member in need .\nThis will put you back in a place of strength and that \u2019 s what you need right now .\nVisualize what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from start to finish- what time do you wake up ?\nWhat do you do first ?\nWho do you spend time with ?\nHow do you structure your day ?\nWhat hobbies and passions do you pursue ?\nNow that you have a vision of who you want to be , try implementing these things into your life .\nWhen your life is full and fulfilling , you effortlessly attract more goodness .", "author": "Sabrina Bendory", "url":

\u2019 t really want ?\nIt \u2019 s confusing and frustrating .\nClearly , you have redeeming qualities because there are some guys who want to date you\u2026 it just doesn \u2019 t seem to be the ones that you really want .\nWhy ?\nI asked this question to myself a lot when I was single and dating in my twenties .\nIt was so confusing because at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt seemed like once I reciprocated that things went off the rails and suddenly I was desperate and chasing instead of being pursued .\nThis is something many , many women have experienced as well .\nLet \u2019 s look at it a little deeper\u2026 It really comes down to your vibe .\nWhat does that mean ?\nYour vibe is your energy essentially , and this is created based on the thoughts you think and your overall mindset .\nAnd most people can intuitively pick up on someone \u2019 s vibe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the presence of an anxious , insecure person .\nYou also know when you \u2019 re in the presence of a confident , happy person .\nBeing positive is a vibe ; it \u2019 s an energy that comes across .\nYou can be saying all the right things , but if you feel negative inside , it will still come across .\nOur vibe attracts people or drives them away .\nThis is why women often encounter the phenomenon of easily attracting guys they aren \u2019 t super into\u2026 and repelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhen I posted about this on my Tik Tok , a lot of people in the comments said that if the guys you want don \u2019 t want you it \u2019 s because you \u2019 re going for guys \u201c out of your league.\n\u201d First , I don \u2019 t believe in leagues .\nI think those can easily be transcended and your \u201c league \u201d is more a state of mind than anything else , which can be changed .\nBut I \u2019 m not talking about wanting a guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you .\nI \u2019 m talking about a guy who was genuinely interested in you to start , and then it suddenly seemed to shift .\nNow sometimes it \u2019 s because it wasn \u2019 t a match .\nBut if you notice this only happens with guys you really like and really want to get serious with , well then it \u2019 s probably something else .\nWhy does this happen ?\nWell , in a nutshell , with the guys you don \u2019 t want , or the guys you \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s easy to be happy and positive and uncensored because you don \u2019 t have much at stake .\nYou don \u2019 t let worries or fears or insecurities enter the picture because you \u2019 re not so attached to the outcome .\nInstead , you just enjoy your interactions with this other person , and if it works out , great .\nIf it doesn \u2019 t , then that \u2019 s fine , too\u2014you weren \u2019 t so into it anyway .\nNow with the guys you do want there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want things to work out , and this activates your fears \u2026 specifically , your fear that it won \u2019 t work .\nThis leads you to think negative thoughts \u2026 you think about all the guys you \u2019 ve liked in the past and how it didn \u2019 t work out with them , you dwell on your negative characteristics and worry that they will prevent you from getting the love you want , you worry obsessively that you will do something to cause this guy to lose interest .\nThis worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this can take several forms : feeling angry , nervous , self-conscious , paranoid , bitter , jealous , unworthy , foolish , unlovable , etc .\nAll of this comes from stressing over the relationship .\nWhen you \u2019 re in this state of mind , it \u2019 s impossible to form a genuine connection because you \u2019 re not there .\nYou aren \u2019 t present in your interactions with him , you \u2019 re interacting with the worried thoughts in your own mind , not with the person in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when we like someone who doesn \u2019 t seem to reciprocate , it triggers something in us and we mistake this feeling of being triggered for being in love .\nMaybe it brings up old childhood wounds , maybe it activates your subconscious fears of not being good enough , of never finding love .\nYou have to step out of the emotional whirlpool of your own thoughts and look at what \u2019 s really happening inside of you and why .\nOver 90 % of communication is non-verbal , so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how you truly feel speaks louder .\nThe most important thing to focus on is getting to the right place internally .\nYou need to get a handle on your thoughts and start challenging the ones that don \u2019 t serve you .\nStart by noticing your thoughts throughout the day .\nThen look at the thought .\nLet \u2019 s say you think , \u201c This guy didn \u2019 t text me back\u2026 he must be losing interest .\nWhy does this always happen to me ?\n\u201d Stop .\nNotice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does this thought serve me well ?\nDoes this take me where I want to go ?\nIf it \u2019 s bringing up feelings of fear , insecurity , anxiety , negativity , and so on , then the answer is no .\nIt \u2019 s not

probably end up breaking up again shortly after .\nI \u2019 m going to tell you how to make him regret leaving you , and it just so happens that doing these things will help you get to a stronger , more empowered place overall , a place where you \u2019 re ready for an emotionally healthy relationship , either with the ex or someone else .\nThis is a must whether you want him back or you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off all contact .\nNo calls , no texts , no snaps , no staging accidental run-ins , and I \u2019 ll also add no creeping on his social media accounts even though that doesn \u2019 t technically count as contact because it has the same damaging effect .\nStudies have found that continuing contact with an ex can disrupt emotional recovery .\nSo you basically cause yourself to be stuck in the same vulnerable , miserable place .\nA breakup can cause a lot of confusing emotions and you \u2019 re not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time .\nYou need time and space to detox from it all .\nYour impulse control is way down after a breakup , which can cause you to do things that sabotage your chances of getting what you truly want , which is to get your ex back ( or maybe to move on completely ) .\nYou may act unhinged or needy or desperate , and this may make him feel even more sure he doesn \u2019 t want to get back together .\nThis will also jackhammer your self-esteem into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want here .\n2 .\nGive him what he wants .\nDoes he want a breakup ?\nGreat , give it to him !\nSometimes it takes a whopping dose of giving someone what they think they want in order to make them realize they don \u2019 t want it .\nHe broke up with you\u2026OK , now you \u2019 re not in his life anymore .\nNow he can feel what that really means .\nHe can \u2019 t experience the pain of your absence unless you are absent .\nHe \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just let it go .\nHe probably will expect you to chase him , he \u2019 ll expect to be able to get you back as soon as he wants you , he thinks he \u2019 ll continue hearing from you , and he most likely doesn \u2019 t think this is so final .\nDon \u2019 t let him be so sure of these convictions !\nDon \u2019 t go where you aren \u2019 t wanted .\nYou are worth more than that .\nAnd please don \u2019 t try to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well !\nAfter a breakup , you shouldn \u2019 t ask , \u201c How can I get him back ?\n\u201d You shouldn \u2019 t even ask the title of this article : \u201c How can I make him regret leaving me ?\n\u201d The question you should be asking is : How can I move on from this ?\nIt feels counterintuitive if you want him , and whenever I give this advice to my coaching clients I can see the immediate resistance on their faces .\nI \u2019 m trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling me to move on ?\n!\nBut it must be done .\nYou have to remember you can live without him .\nYou have to get back in touch with yourself , remember you ?\nI bet you lost a lot of yourself in this relationship\u2026 the end of a relationship can absolutely swallow you whole .\nSo check in with you- how are you doing ?\nWhat is it you need ?\nYou \u2019 ve spent so long thinking about him and his needs and his feelings\u2026 what about you ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nYes , but that can only happen further down the line when you \u2019 ve both worked on yourselves and are emotionally healthy enough to repair what broke the first time in the relationship .\nIf not , then history is just going to repeat itself .\nA relationship on the decline can deplete you .\nYour time away from him is the equivalent of a can of spinach for Pop-Eye , it will help make you strong again .\nBecome someone stronger than who that relationship made you .\nFind your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice- do you really choose him ?\nOr do you just want him because it \u2019 s easy and comfortable and you already know him and you \u2019 d rather go back to something familiar and comfortable even if the familiar isn \u2019 t what \u2019 s best for you because starting over is just so daunting ?\nIf you don \u2019 t find your inner power , you will just be at his mercy and will cave in whenever he wants to see you .\nYou may put up with bad behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat and ruining your chances of getting him back .\nThis may lead you to a toxic on-again off-again relationship .\nBe stronger so you can make better choices for yourself .\nI \u2019 m not saying you can \u2019 t get him back and make it work a second time , it \u2019 s definitely possible ( I mean , I married an ex ! )\n.\nBut it will not be different unless something is different !\nChange takes time and work and reflection and insight .\nYou broke up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t magically repair themselves .\nBoth people need to be committed to fixing whatever broke .\nBoth people need to work independently on themselves and together as a unit .\nSo if he comes back\u2026 don \u2019 t be so quick to give in .\nDon \u2019 t run and see him whenever he beckons .\nDon \u2019 t answer his texts in the middle of the night .\nDon \u2019 t be a starving puppy panting at his heels , waiting for any scrap of affection he \u2019 s willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel good about yourself , it will only make things worse .\nI promise you are not always going to feel the way you do right now .\nYou will not always miss him so intensely .\nYou will one day be able to envision a better , brighter future for yourself that doesn \u2019 t include him .\nOne day you will look back and realize this was for the best .\nOne day you will realize that this shaped you in immeasurable ways .\nIt will all make sense eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this go and reconcile with what is , the sooner you will free yourself and can move on and be happy .", "author": "Sabrina

Planning According To Babylon", "content": "So , you want to plan a party ?\nThen you \u2019 re in the right place !\nThe specifics of every party will be different , but they all follow the same general principles\u2014at least , every good party does , and those are the only ones that matter .\nTake a look at Paramount \u2019 s Babylon\u2014every scene is outrageously wild , extravagant , and pretty much impossible to tear your eyes away from .\nAnd shouldn \u2019 t that be the point of every social gathering ?\nLife is short , so make the most of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party of the decade .\n( You can thank me for my service later ! )\nBigger is always better .\nLook , I know we \u2019 ve all embraced minimalism at least a little over the past few years , either for ethical , aesthetic , or practical reasons .\nBut here \u2019 s the thing : If you \u2019 re trying to throw the party of the year , you \u2019 ve got to lean into the extravagance of it all .\nThink about Babylon\u2014a huge part of the appeal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t want to ( and probably can \u2019 t ) look away .\nAnd while we can \u2019 t all transport a literal live elephant to our houses like the movie , that doesn \u2019 t mean you should give up and think small .\nWhile I thoroughly believe that the more intricate , the better , you can still keep things interesting in simpler ways : fill the room with balloons , set up shiny decorations meant to catch the light , break out your most interesting drinkware , and add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If people are taking pictures so they can show people later , you know you did well .\nSpeaking of interesting drinkware\u2026 Don \u2019 t get me wrong , cracking open a cold beer or some low-shelf whiskey isn \u2019 t a bad time , but the best parties of all make drinking feel fun , elegant , or just special compared to what someone could do at home .\nIt \u2019 s okay if you don \u2019 t have the means to splurge on expensive alcohol , but that doesn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun cocktail list nonetheless .\nYou can search recipes based on what you already have sitting around your house or even just based on your guest list and what you \u2019 d expect them to drink .\nYou can even look up fun ways to display the drinks\u2014champagne fountain , anyone ?\nIt \u2019 s best to think of your beverages as part of the decor , because nothing gets people talking like an interesting cocktail .\nMake sure there \u2019 s always a killer playlist ready in advance .\nNot every party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most parties ) , but that doesn \u2019 t mean your guests have to suffer in silence .\nIf Babylon \u2019 s visual aesthetics are the main course , its soundtrack is that little extra garnish that keeps it fun and interesting .\nIf you want to ensure your party has the best vibes possible , you \u2019 ll want to make sure you have a playlist made and ready in advance , because nothing \u2019 s worse than trying to keep the music going mid-party .\nPick the songs based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve ( and the audience you \u2019 re hoping to attract ) , because the music is what really sets the scene for the night ( i.e .\nif you \u2019 re hoping to keep people awake all night , go ahead and skip the Bon Iver ) .\nPick a theme and run with it .\nThemes probably aren \u2019 t necessary for a party to be great , but it actually helps a lot with figuring out how you want to decorate your space or what to serve your guests .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a certain movie , serve drinks that fit the time period and find easy ways to recreate certain sets or important details that will act as little easter eggs for your guests .\nTruthfully , planning a party should be both creative and fun\u2014so don \u2019 t be afraid to get really into the process !\nThat doesn \u2019 t mean you have to enforce it , but just dropping the suggestion to your invited guests will be enough to convince some of them to adhere to it anyway .\nYou can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , asking people to dress up as a character from said movie\u2014or you can simply suggest people dress up nicely in general , like Babylon \u2019 s black-tie best ( personally , you can expect me to show up in a Nellie LaRoy original , because that girl knows how to shine ) .\nA dress code will make your party feel more like an event than just a gathering , and who doesn \u2019 t love a good reason to dress up in the outfits they never have an excuse to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too boring to matter anyway .\nAlways plan for the worst .\nHere \u2019 s one of the biggest rules to party planning : Hope for the best , but plan for the worst .\nExpect things to take longer than you originally accounted for and don \u2019 t be surprised if things don \u2019 t go the way you planned .\nOne of the most frustrating parts of hosting a party is also one of the most fun aspects , and it \u2019 s this : Parties are spontaneous .\nThey \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 re lucky , chaotic .\nYou \u2019 ll never be able to predict how the night will end , so it \u2019 s always good to try to account for any outcome so that you won \u2019 t spend the evening stressing over minor details .\nMake sure you \u2019 re the center of attention .\nLook , if you \u2019 re going to go through all the trouble of throwing the best party in town , you \u2019 d better at least let yourself enjoy it fully .\nThink Margot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who \u2019 s never afraid to do what it takes to get people \u2019 s attention\u2014put on your most eye-catching outfit , make sure you have the time to do your makeup in whatever way you prefer , and most importantly , don \u2019 t let your hosting duties take away from letting yourself let loose .\nThat \u2019 s the whole point of party planning\u2014as long as you have everything ready in advance , you \u2019 ll have plenty of time to make it the best night of your life .\nAfter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , you \u2019 re the one who actually deserves it !",

.\nHere are six of those show-stopping scenes .\nTransporting a live elephant from the dusty outskirts of Los Angeles to a party in Bel Air .\nLet \u2019 s address the elephant in the room , shall we

?\nTo make a scene !\nGranted , it does not go well but not in the way you \u2019 d think .\nA manic race through the streets of LA with the last available camera in the city before the sun sets on an

one point , there is a race through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last-available camera and utter mayhem follows suit .\nThis scene really captures the importance of lighting in movies and will make you appreciate these details more than you have before .\nBecause obviously !\nIt \u2019 s Tobey Maguire !\nMaguire \u2019 s performance will make you understand the value of casting .\nMargot Robbie

primarily a rom com , but it does have a very sweet love story wrapped inside of all the other funny moments that keep us coming back to watch it every year .\nNot only is it the heartwarming story of a son who finally gets to reconnect with his estranged father , but it \u2019 s also an extremely sweet love story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cynical retail worker who opens her heart to Buddy \u2019 s childlike wonder .\nElf is a great reminder about how simple love can be if you let it\u2014and how fun and childlike we can become when we know we \u2019 ve found the one .\nFor the hopeless romantic

, it definitely leans more into the comedy aspect , which makes for a particularly fun Christmas Eve viewing party .\nFor the hopeless romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truth be told , Love , Actually didn \u2019 t age all that well , which may put off newer viewers who want to give it a try .\nBut for those of us who like to turn back to our favorite holiday movies again and again , Love , Actually is

\u2019 t mean you always will be .\nFor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama ( and yearning ) in their romances .\nThe Noel Diary is set around Christmas , so you get all the fun wintry and holiday settings , but besides that , it doesn \u2019 t necessarily feel like a Christmas movie .\nThat \u2019 s probably because the plot itself is pretty heavy : It follows novelist Jake Turner ( played by Justin Hartley

definitely one of those Netflix films that feels a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to be super deep , but it \u2019 s sweet and just fantastical enough that it encapsulates the magic of the season .\nThe movie follows Sir Cole , a knight from 1334 , who runs into an old crone in the woods who magically transports him to 2019 .\nThat \u2019 s where he meets Vanessa Hudgins \u2019 s Brooke , a high school

forms\u2014and they \u2019 re all equally beautiful .\nThis is another Norwegian Netflix show that doesn \u2019 t disappoint .\nThe premise feels a bit like Love , Actually in that it revolves around a large cast of characters who are all spending the holiday stuck in an airport ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose lives seamlessly weave together as they pass the time and panic over their shared misfortune .\nBut what \u2019 s so special about this show is that it \u2019 s full of all different kinds of love\u2014the love between spouses , between parents and children , between strangers who bond over shared circumstances , between good samaritans and the people whose lives they touch in small but meaningful ways .\nThis show is a great reminder to be good to your fellow human , because we never

Love Life As A HIV+ Woman", "content": "Relationships are often one of the biggest struggles among people living with HIV .\nNo matter what the situation is , starting or maintaining a relationship after an HIV diagnosis can be a challenge .\nI \u2019 ve been married since 2018 , and I was living my best life when I started to feel sick .\nI had several episodes of fever that would come and go , visited many doctors who would run blood work on me with a normal result , and told me to wait for a result of \u201c the flu \u201d or something similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year experiencing different symptoms that could be of pretty much anything .\nIt was only at the beginning of 2020 when I was extremely ill , weak , full of skin rashes , had lost several kilos and hair , and had trouble breathing and moving , that I was taken to a hospital where a doctor finally suggested an HIV test .\nI was diagnosed with full-blown AIDS , already in the late stages with opportunistic infections taking over my lungs , eyes , spine , and skin , and had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment immediately .\nI don \u2019 t need to tell you how huge that shock was .\nI had never considered being infected with HIV .\nI had been very careful with my sexual life and did not engage in sex with people I didn \u2019 t know well \u2013 or so I thought .\nFor my husband , it was an equal if not bigger shock .\nI was awfully weak and could barely react to the news .\nI had all the hospital staff , my family , and him supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news alone at home , afraid of sharing it with anybody , not knowing what our lives would be , not even knowing if I was going to survive .\nMy husband tested negative .\nThat was a surprise , as none of us knew this was even possible .\nOnly then we learned that not only it can happen , but that it happens very often .\nThe transmission of HIV in a sexual act between a man and a woman when the woman is the one with the virus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI spent 28 days in the hospital , and when I was admitted , both my husband and I were told by the doctors that my health condition was wretched and that we should be prepared for the worst .\nThey told me to talk to my family and be ready to say goodbye .\nMy husband visited me every single day and I was in constant contact with my family , who live in my home country .\nMy body reacted beautifully to treatment , and I was able to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hospital .\nThat meant taking the medication for all the opportunistic infections I was treating , for HIV , eating well , sleeping well , not going outside for no reason , and attending every health check and doctor \u2019 s appointment I had \u2013 and there were plenty .\nOn the way home , I had the opportunity to be alone with my husband for the first time since my diagnosis , and I could ask him how he was feeling about it .\nI asked him if he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would understand if it was the case .\nHe told me that there was no way he would leave me , we were married \u201c in health and sickness \u201d and he wanted to stay with me .\nHis support was of fundamental importance for my treatment to succeed , there was a lot to process , and a breakup at that point in my life would annihilate my strength .\nUnfortunately , not everyone has the same experience .\nI have noticed , after publicly disclosing my status and having the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the world , that there are all sorts of reactions from partners when their loved ones are diagnosed with HIV .\nI have noticed that most partners stay , but there are also the ones who abandon , who reject , bully , accuse , hurt , and make things a lot worse .\nWhat you need to remember is that nobody gets infected with HIV on purpose .\nAn HIV infection can happen to anyone .\nAny person , living an active , sexual life , is at risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your relatives , your neighbors , and perhaps your parents .\nThe worse thing about HIV nowadays is stigma .\nIt makes people isolate themselves , discourages treatment , it causes horrible feelings , shame , and guilt .\nThere is an effective treatment for HIV , but the stigma still has the power to kill .\nHandling the news of an HIV diagnosis is already very hard , there is a lot to process , and many mental adjustments to be made .\nImagine having to deal with the person you love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to turn what happened to you into something you should be blamed for , should be ashamed of .\nIt is a different , yet quite similarly arduous challenge for the ones who are single when they get diagnosed with HIV .\nOne universal reaction among all of us who hear this diagnosis is to question everything .\nHow will life be , how will work be , how will social life be , friendship , and the question that demands more time and consideration , how will relationships be ?\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern , they are living with HIV and keep their status a secret ( as it is their right ) and they are falling in love with someone , the feeling is reciprocal , and they want to tell the other person but don \u2019 t know how .\nAs this wasn \u2019 t my personal experience , I started making research to find out what is the best way to make this communication , and this is what I found out : The best strategy is to probe the partner \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they already know .\nPull the subject up out of nowhere , use a \u201c friend \u201d as an example , and talk about the subject to understand the grounds .\nThen , slowly start dropping important information , such as U=U , asking something like \u201c do you know that a person living with HIV following effective treatment becomes untransmittable ?\n\u201d It means that when the blood test can not detect that viral load in that person \u2019 s blood , that person is considered undetectable and after a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus sexually anymore , even without a condom .\nThey can have babies if they want , that will be born without the virus .\nTalk about the fact that treatment for HIV nowadays is so effective that it gives people the same life expectancy as someone who does not have the virus .\nTalk about the fact that a person living with HIV can live everyday life , that HIV became a chronic condition , just like diabetes , that only requires daily medication and self-love .\nWhen the partner seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the talk , you tell .\nThis kind of communication will always be scary , as we never know what the reaction will be .\nNo one wants to be rejected , and it \u2019 s a human condition to be afraid of getting hurt .\nBut opening up about the HIV status when it \u2019 s something you want to do is extremely important .\nIt shows that you care , that you are committed to the feelings you have for that person , to yourself , to your treatment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person \u2019 s health at risk .\nAnd I am very pleased to tell you that most people react kindly and positively to the news .\nWhen there is a deeper feeling involved , they tend to hear , support , to navigate that journey together .\nIf they don \u2019 t , you know it \u2019 s someone you should not have in your life .\nWe are living in an era where there are options to prevent HIV infection , we have a pre-exposure prophylaxis called PrEP , being either pill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injected .\nWe have PEP , post-exposure prophylaxis that has to be started in the first 72 hours of the exposure ( for PrEP and PEP you need a doctor \u2019 s assessment and prescription ) , we have condoms , that should be a norm as they not only prevent HIV but also most of the other Sexually Transmitted Infections ( STIs ) , and we also have HIV testing and HIV treatment , being part of the prevention methods as they stop the infection chain .\nStill , an infection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an era where treatment for HIV is so effective that life continuous normal , a person living with HIV can do pretty much everything a person who does not have the virus can , except for donating blood , and breastfeeding .\nIt is unacceptable that people insist to be in a place where they think they can judge someone for having been infected with a virus they are also prone to .\nPeople who insist to stigmatize HIV are lacking information , lacking orientation , lacking education , and ignore all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them .\nThese are not the people you should let have the power to hurt you .", "author": "Maya Viecili", "url": "https://thoughtcatalog.com/maya-viecili/2022/12/how-to-navigate-your-love-life-as-a-hiv-woman/", "published": "Tue, 27

an adolescent was my type 1 diabetes .\nWhen I was diagnosed at age 10 , I heard the doctors mention diabetes and thought , You mean the old person \u2019 s disease ?\nI was so worried about my peers

\u201cGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\u201d", "content": "Writer and Director Rian Johnson has once again reinvigorated the sparsely populated murder mystery genre with his latest installment of the Benoit Blanc franchise .\nThe biggest problem with the Knives Out films is that we as an audience have to wait too long between chapters .\nWith broad influences from the collective works of Agatha Christie to films like Murder By Death , Clue , and The Thin Man ; Johnson brings a much needed dose of modernity and comedy to his brand .\nGlass Onion is in many ways , a classic murder mystery .\nIt is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exotic and the participants are wealthy .\nIn the movie world , poor people just don \u2019 t get renown detectives on their cases .\nTo that point the film leans into the absurdity of its wealth and location .\nThe Glass Onion itself is a new monied , wet dream .\nIt \u2019 s the name of a compound on a private Greek island , that is all things tech bro meets bond villain .\nThe island is owned by Miles Bron ; an app billionaire who flaunts his money and buys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaudy innovation .\nThe island and mansion that the film primarily take place in , play as much of a part in the story as any cast member .\nThe initial hook of the film is mildly intriguing as a handful of seemingly unconnected elites receive mystery boxes containing elaborate puzzles that ultimately invite them to an annual gathering .\nWhile the setup is novel , the numerous puzzles are all solved too quickly and without audience participation .\nAt this early point the film nearly loses its audience until Janelle Monae shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box to open it .\nShe \u2019 s a great representation of the film itself ; taking predictable puzzle solving story and smashing it to pull the audience in .\nThe invitations inside the aforementioned boxes are specifically for a group known as the \u201c disruptors \u201d .\nA once poor , collection of aspiring business persons who have all succeeded and now assemble once a year at the behest of their wealthiest friend , billionaire Miles .\nThis year \u2019 s gathering is special .\nHe is throwing a murder mystery weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure out who killed him in a very elaborate and expensively designed party game that only stupid money could buy .\nFive invitations are sent out , yet six guests ( aside from a girlfriend and personal assistant ) arrive .\nThe extra invitee is the world \u2019 s greatest detective Benoit Blanc , who has somehow also received a boxed puzzle , despite Miles specifically creating only five .\nWhy is Blanc there and who invited him ?\nWill there be an actual murder or is this part of a rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a solid setup that is not afraid to poke fun at itself .\nIt constantly treads between vintage ageless detective story and modern celebrity influencer culture , dropping names and fake brands like Jared Leto \u2019 s hard kombucha , a boat dock designed by Banksy , and a never overused Jeremy Renner \u2019 s hot sauce .\nWithout unraveling the yarn and giving away the twists of the film , ( which is the point of watching any whodunnit ) let \u2019 s break down what worked and didn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knives Out feel less developed than the previous installment .\nMuch improved is Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc who has a firmer grasp on his southern draw and somehow works far better this time as a young man acting like an elderly gentleman , a generation his senior .\nWhether he swims in a full suit or wears a neck kerchief like a frail octogenarian despite being obviously jacked , it plays well with his character and flows seamlessly .\nBlanc is more than the glue of the film , he is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseline for the franchise .\nOn this memorable character alone , we can see why Netflix has purchased multiple installments .\nCritics like to justifiably give Craig the Foghorn Leghorn stigma but say what you want , it \u2019 s successful .\nHe \u2019 s captivating and likable .\nEqually memorable is Ed Norton as Miles Bron .\nWhether it \u2019 s the brilliance of Norton \u2019 s acting or the fact that you \u2019 ll rarely heard a kind word spoken of him in Hollywood circles , he plays a great antagonist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience is dying to punch him square in the face in every scene .\nIs he even acting or did he just show up and start riffing ?\nWith Norton \u2019 s depth of skill it is often hard to tell , but likewise he plays a brilliant part in the film as the out of touch , self righteous and obliviously rich douche .\nThe brightest star in this film is that of Janelle Monae .\nNot only is her character easily the most developed but she carries the second act nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard twist and pulls the viewer directly out of the storyline .\nWhile this is the slowest part of the film that should have been trimmed down , Monae gives her role depth and charisma to gracefully steal the entire midsection from Craig and become the most watchable member of the ensemble .\nUnfortunately , the other cast members with their usual on screen personalities are not allowed to shine here .\nTheir talents are all but wasted in Glass Onion .\nKatherine Hahn as a hungry and desperate politician has very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than reactive expressions .\nDave Bautista as an \u00fcber macho social media influencer also gets few punchlines and is more of a physical presence as is his girlfriend Whiskey , played by Madelyn Cline .\nTony and Grammy winner Leslie Odom Jr. skillset is completely boxed in as a scientist with little dialogue and even less motive to be on the island as one of the \u201c disruptors \u201d .\nThe only other actor given moments to flex was Kate Hudson who plays a politically incorrect ditz and leisurewear millionaire .\nThe continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes her part work as it pokes fake fun at her real world brand , Fabletics and channels her Goldie Hawn genetics to be quite likable even in her horridness .\nIn defense of Rian Johnson , it is not easy to have a paced , three act mystery while also giving enough backstory and screen time to eight distinctly different characters .\nThat said , the move is more than long enough to have done that and the on screen talent aside from Craig , Norton , and Monae was present but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the look and overall direction of this film .\nThe set design and coloring of Glass Onion are excellent .\nThey bring the crisp , modern freshness of cutting edge technology and wealth to the few rooms and set pieces where the majority of the film take place .\nThey keep the film bright and sexy as do the vivid costuming of the characters , enough for this to feel like a romantic throwback despite being present day .\nKudos to the art department and costume designer .\nWhether its the hilarious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stylish modernity of the Onion itself , the look of this film is absolute eye candy .\nReds pop , everyone is glowing and there isn \u2019 t anything that isn \u2019 t passionately illuminated .\nUltimately , the twists and turns of Glass Onion deliver as they should .\nThe audience is involved immediately and are all expected to take their guesses as to who did what and why .\nThere are non linear breaks in the film that do slow it down but give it some extra depth and backstory that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal .\nThe climax has a poppy kick and certainly pays off far better than that of the remake of \u201c Murder on the Orient Express \u201d or \u201c Death On the Nile \u201d .\nWhile the big twist isn \u2019 t quite on the level as that of the first Knives Out , it is good fun and delivers with far greater energy than that of its predecessor .\nMany will call this a run of the mill murder mystery that might be ultimately forgotten in decades to come , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being created to be nearly free for viewers on Netflix .\nIn that regard I absolutely applaud it .\nFor the ability to plug in , be engrossed and entertained with something different for a few hours , I hope Netflix green lights a dozen more of these .\nBenoit Blanc is good fun and these mystery films are water cooler murder meets pandemic escapism at its best .\nThanks Rian and keep em \u2019 coming .", "author": "Brandon Trones", "url":
