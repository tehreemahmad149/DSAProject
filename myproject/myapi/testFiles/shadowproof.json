Guant\u00e1namo military prison was approved for transfer a day before the detention camp marked the 20th anniversary of confining prisoners in the \u201c war on terrorism.\n\u201d According to lawyers from Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) who represented him , Guled Hassan Duran was captured in Djibouti in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a secret prison site , where he was tortured and abused prior to his transfer to Guant\u00e1namo in 2006 .\nHe was designated by President Barack Obama \u2019 s review task force for indefinite detention , even though he was not charged with a crime .\nDuran is a citizen of Somalia with \u201c prior residence in Germany and Sweden.\n\u201d Congress prohibited the United States government from transferring any Guant\u00e1namo prisoners to Libya , Somalia , Syria , or Yemen in 2015 .\nBecause he can not return to Somalia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is released to a country willing to accept him .\nThirty-nine prisoners remain indefinitely detained at Guant\u00e1namo .\nThey have been in confinement for the past 15-to-20 years without charge or trial .\nThe withdrawal of U.S. military forces in Afghanistan in 2021 gives the U.S. government even less of a justification for keeping the prison open .\nHowever , President Joe Biden \u2019 s administration has displayed little to no political will to close Guant\u00e1namo once and for all .\nOr to put it another way , Biden has not demonstrated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job he started when he was part of the Obama administration in 2009 and they formally pledged to close Guant\u00e1namo .\n\u2018 This Monstrous Creation Of The U.S. Government \u2019 CCR , a lead organization in the fight to shut down the detention camp , declared , \u201c For 20 years , this monstrous creation of the U.S. government has been intentionally inflicting human suffering.\n\u201d \u201c Today , we think of the victims : the 780 Muslim men and boys , who have faced injustice and brutality , from torture to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding to profound indifference , if not hostility , from U.S. political leaders.\n\u201d \u201c We also think of the families who have been without their loved ones for so long and do not know when or if they will see them again , \u201d CCR added .\nTwenty-seven prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo have never been charged .\nCCR estimates that 26 prisoners survived CIA torture .\nFive of them , including Duran , are represented by CCR .\nSufiyan Barhoumi , who is from Algeria , was cleared for transfer in 2016 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer him out of Guant\u00e1namo before President Donald Trump was inaugurated .\nHe was brought to the detention camp in June 2002 .\nBrought to Guant\u00e1namo in 2004 , CCR says Sharqawi Al Hajj , who is from Yemen , was tortured at \u201c two CIA black sites.\n\u201d As a result , he suffers from severe health problems that could result in \u201c total bodily collapse.\n\u201d The Biden administration approved him for transfer in June 2021 , however , he can not return to Yemen because of the congressional ban that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen named Mohammed Al Qahtani was allegedly subject to CIA torture and rendition before he arrived at Guant\u00e1namo in February 2002 .\nHe was diagnosed with schizophrenia prior to this abuse .\nHis mental health is \u201c deteriorating rapidly , \u201d according to CCR .\nBut he remains in confinement despite the fact that Qahtani is charged with no crime .\nIn fact , in 2009 , Susan Crawford , a U.S. Defense Department official who was the head of the military commissions , admitted the U.S. \u201c tortured \u201d Qahtani .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the manner in which they applied them was overly aggressive and too persistent , \u201d Crawford told the Washington Post .\n\u201c You think of torture , you think of some horrendous physical act done to an individual .\nThis was not any one particular act ; this was just a combination of things that had a medical impact on him , that hurt his health .\nIt was abusive and uncalled for .\nAnd coercive .\nClearly coercive .\nIt was that medical impact that pushed me over the edge.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. government ever publicly admitted they tortured .\nYet when CCR pushed for the release of videos and photos of Qahtani to show Americans evidence of systematic abuse , the Obama administration blocked their release in federal court .\nU.S. Central Command Chief of Staff Karl Horst argued the release of photos and video would endanger \u201c U.S .\nmilitary personnel , diplomats and aid workers serving in Afghanistan and elsewhere \u201d and aid the \u201c recruitment and financing of extremist and insurgent groups \u201d because \u201c enemy forces in Afghanistan \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and photographs [ particularly of U.S. forces interacting with detainees ] out of context to incite the civilian population and influence government officials.\n\u201d The media published images in 2004 \u201c relating to allegations of abuse of Iraqi detainees \u201d ( i.e .\nAbu Ghraib ) and media reported in 2005 on \u201c alleged incidents of mishandling of the Koran at Guant\u00e1namo , \u201d Horst added .\nTo be clear , the Obama administration argued evidence of torture had to be kept secret because it would upset groups the U.S. had designated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts the photos and videos \u201c could be manipulated to show greater mistreatment than actually occurred , or change the chronology of actual events \u201d in order to help the Pentagon hide torture and abuse .\n( The courts shamefully accepted these secrecy arguments . )\nThe First Survivor Of CIA Torture At Black Site Prisons To Speak Out\u2014While Still In Custody The Biden administration has yet to \u201c re-establish the special envoy office in the State Department dedicated to the prison \u2019 s closure , \u201d according to Amnesty International .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just announced plans to build a new courtroom at Guant\u00e1namo to continue the work by the military commissions \u2013 the very opposite of a blueprint to shut the place down , \u201d Amnesty stated on the 20th anniversary .\nAs Amnesty noted , in 2021 , the world heard horrific stories of torture and abuse from Majid Khan , Abu Zubaydah , and Mohamedou Slahi , who was the subject of a film called \u201c The Mauritanian.\n\u201d Khan is a Pakistani eligible for release in February 2022 .\nHe had political asylum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was brought to Guant\u00e1namo in 2006 .\nCCR , which represents him , says he is \u201c the first survivor of the CIA torture program to discuss in public his experiences at black sites.\n\u201d [ PDF ] Eight U.S. military officers sentenced Khan to 26 years in prison in October 2021 .\nThe New York Times called it \u201c symbolic \u201d because he became a \u201c government cooperator \u201d when he pled guilty in February 2012 .\nSeven of the eight officers recommended clemency for Khan .\nA sentencing statement featuring brutal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read by Khan in a courtroom at Guant\u00e1namo .\n\u201c I can say for certain that I was subjected to water torture that induced the feeling of drowning several times , \u201d Khan stated .\n\u201c It is hard to describe , or put into words , how it felt to be waterboarded .\nWith a hood wrapped around my face and water pouring down my throat , I coughed , gagged , screamed , and couldn \u2019 t breathe .\nI felt like I was going to die.\n\u201d When Khan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afghanistan , the CIA removed his clothes and left him cold and naked .\nHe was given no food and afraid to drink the water the CIA officers provided .\n\u201c I was periodically and repeatedly doused with water , \u201d Khan recalled .\n\u201c The room was pitch black , but I could feel tiny bugs , smaller than mosquitoes , biting me repeatedly until I bled .\nWith my hands shackled , I couldn \u2019 t swat the bugs or scratch the sores they left .\nThere was also music played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking the room was shaking.\n\u201d \u201c I was hung at a height where I was able to bend my legs slightly , but I was not able to sit or kneel .\nI remember the intense feeling of uncertainty that I felt ; it was horrifying .\nI was so scared .\nI had no choice but to urinate on myself and the floor.\n\u201d Khan continued , \u201c I was so terrified that I had diarrhea .\nMy back and entire body was in a constant state of excruciating pain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI was left for days with the smell of urine and feces that had collected on my body.\n\u201d The CIA brought Khan to a secret prison referred to as \u201c Detention Site Orange , \u201d where he was held for a longer amount of time before his transfer to Guant\u00e1namo .\n\u201c In the month of September 2004 , \u201d Khan says he was \u201c raped by the CIA medics.\n\u201d He was engaged in a series of hunger strikes .\n\u201c While being restrained , they inserted tubes or objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was different than the enemas they had previously used.\n\u201d \u201c Sometimes it was done in my cell .\nOther times I was restrained on a stretcher and moved to another room .\nIn either location , I was restrained very tightly and securely by at least two guards .\nA CIA medic was there to administer the insertions , but it was not a medical procedure.\n\u201d Khan added , \u201c I remember one time in my cell I asked the medic why he was doing this , and he whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fucking terrorist.\n\u2019 They used green garden hoses and one end was connected to the faucet as they \u2018 rehydrated me.\n\u2019 \u201d \u201c I remember feeling immense pressure in my bowels , a pain I had never felt .\nI couldn \u2019 t stop myself from evacuating my bowels .\nI think these forced rectal insertions were done to make it appear like I had eaten , digested food , and used the toilet .\nTo this day , I experience extreme discomfort from hemorrhoids as a result of my treatment.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ told his captors what they wanted .\nHe was scared .\nHe wanted the torture to stop .\nHe made false statements to interrogators in order to convince them he was \u201c compliant and cooperative.\n\u201d Khan continued to lie when he arrived at Guant\u00e1namo because it renewed his fears and forced him to relive prior traumas and experiences at the hands of CIA interrogators .\nIt wasn \u2019 t until October 2007 that he finally felt comfortable enough to tell the truth to his defense team and take responsibility for some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr .\nKhan has been held without basic due process under the U.S. Constitution .\nSpecifically , he was held without charge or legal representation for nine years until 2012 and held without final sentencing until October 2021 , \u201d U.S. military officers wrote in their clemency letter [ PDF ] .\nThe officers acknowledged Khan was \u201c subjected to physical and psychological abuse well beyond approved enhanced interrogation techniques , instead being closer to torture performed by the most abusive regimes in modern history .\nThis abuse was of no practical value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other tangible benefit to U.S. interests.\n\u201d \u201c Instead , it is a stain on the moral fiber of America .\nThe treatment of Mr. Khan in the hands of U.S. personnel should be a source of shame for the U.S. government.\n\u201d Further Reading : Guantanamo Whistleblowers Who Spoke Up Against a Legal Black Hole", "author": "Kevin Gosztola", "url":

of Shadowproof .\nBecome a paid subscriber and help us expand our work .\nAn Iowa judge upheld one of the state \u2019 s \u201c ag-gag \u201d laws in a case brought against an animal rights activist , hours before dismissing all charges .\nIn Iowa , a person may be criminalized for \u201c food operation trespass \u201d if they enter or remain on the property of a factory farm \u201c without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real or apparent authority to allow the person to enter or remain on the property.\n\u201d Matt Johnson , an investigator with the grassroots animal rights network Direct Action Everywhere ( DxE ) , was charged with violating the ag-gag law after he exposed the extermination of pigs by Iowa Select Farms .\nHe argued the law is \u201c actually intended to punish individuals for expressing viewpoints disfavored by the Iowa legislature \u201d and reminded the court that a similar Iowa ag-gag law was previously ruled unconstitutional by a federal court .\nState @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial and moved to dismiss charges , but the court defended the ag-gag charge , which was challenged by Matt Johnson as unconstitutional .\nDistrict Court Judge Derek Johnson ruled that the law \u201c does not discriminate on the basis of the viewpoint of the offender .\nA person who trespasses on a food operation to abuse an animal is treated the same as a person who trespasses on a food operation to rescue one.\n\u201d \u201c That is logically true .\nIt \u2019 s factually preposterous , and it \u2019 s very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent of this law was to target animal rights activists , people with a particular viewpoint , \u201d replied Wayne Hsiung , an attorney for Matt Johnson and co-founder of DxE .\n\u201c You can critique an animal rights activist \u2019 s views .\nYou can say that what they \u2019 re saying is factually false .\nWhat you can not do under the First Amendment is criminalize their speech , and that is the purpose of this law even if facially it doesn \u2019 t say that , \u201d Hsiung added .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to the passage of the \u201c food operation trespass \u201d law .\nTrespassing is generally a fine between $ 65 and $ 625 with the possibility of up to 30 days in prison .\nBut under Iowa \u2019 s ag-gag law , trespassing is an aggravated misdemeanor that carries the possibility of up to two years in prison .\nA repeat offense may result in a felony charge .\nMatt Johnson was charged on July 14 , 2020 , with \u201c burglary in the third degree \u201d and \u201c electronic or mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ag-gag law on April 8 , 2021 .\nThe charges came after Matt Johnson captured \u201c video and audio recordings of pigs screaming in agony for several hours as they died .\nThousands of pigs were exterminated at Iowa Select Farms using ventilation shutdown after COVID-19 outbreaks caused the closure of many slaughterhouses , \u201d according to a press statement from DxE .\nA whistleblower informed the activists of conditions at the factory farm .\nThey rescued a \u201c sickly piglet , \u201d which they later named Gilly .\nWithout saving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a landfill .\nDuring an afternoon hearing on January 19 , prosecutors argued for the dismissal of charges while Matt Johnson contended the charges should be dismissed with prejudice and the prosecutors should be required to outline why they were no longer pursuing the case .\nThe judge conceded in his order upholding the ag-gag charge that animal rights activists are disparately impacted because \u201c some animal rights advocates have an ideological motive to gain physical access to the food animal operations.\n\u201d However , he justified the targeting of animal rights activists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutral \u201d and does not \u201c constitute viewpoint discrimination simply because it may disproportionately affect some speakers or messages more than others.\n\u201d On that point , Hsiung said the judge is allowing the Iowa legislature to \u201c play games with our constitutional rights.\n\u201d Iowa has passed four ag-gag laws .\nThe first two ag-gag laws were struck down in part or in their entirety as unconstitutional because they infringe upon First Amendment rights .\nAccording to Hsiung , the state legislature went forward with two laws that were constructed to \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c constitutional scrutiny \u201d by targeting anyone with severe penalties instead of only animal rights activists , Hsiung also stated , \u201c The notion that someone is going to trespass on property to abuse an animal first of all is just pretty factually unlikely .\nThe only abuse of animals that is happening is by people who own the facility and operate the facility.\n\u201d Each expansion of ag-gag laws throughout the United States is aimed at suppressing journalism , whistleblowing , and speech around animal abuses .\nThey are designed to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who are threatened by transparency and accountability .\nAs of August 2021 , such laws in Idaho , Kansas , North Carolina , Wyoming , and Utah , as well as in Iowa , were declared to be unconstitutional in whole or in part .\nMatt Johnson told The Dissenter in 2019 he led an investigation into a factory farm owned by Iowa Republican state senator Ken Rozenboom .\nIt was a response to his support for ag-gag laws .\nThe investigation was released in spring 2020 .\n\u201c Inside the barns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense overcrowding with noxious ammonia in the air , and excrement coating the floors .\nOne piglet was unable to stand , gasping for air while thrashing wildly for several minutes before dying before our eyes , \u201d DxE reported .\n\u201c It was actually that investigation that led the Iowa Select Farms truck driver to contact us because of the abuse at Iowa Select Farms , which led to the ventilation shutdown expos\u00e9 , \u201d Johnson shared .\nAfter the ventilation shutdown was exposed at the end of May , Rozenboom backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than two weeks later .\nHe said the law addressed the \u201c gravest threats to animal agriculture in Iowa.\n\u201d Rozenboom discussed how DxE investigated his farm and described the organization as an \u201c extreme animal rights group.\n\u201d He cheered the law for imposing a felony against animal rights activists who commit a second offense .\nThe ag-gag law was passed specifically as a response to the investigations and activism of DxE .\nAs Matt Johnson said , it subsequently was used to charge him .\nHe was the \u201c inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the first person to be charged under the law .\nIowa lawmakers escalated their attacks on journalism and whistleblowing around animal abuse in the food industry in 2021 , passing a recording ban that explicitly designates audio or video recording as \u201c trespassing \u201d crimes .\nThe Animal Legal Defense Fund sued the state of Iowa and argued \u201c the law threatens increased penalties for recording even in public places and locations advocates have long used for public advocacy , such as in open areas of legislators \u2019 offices and parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public regularly come and go

Stella Moris , who is Assange \u2019 s partner .\n\u201c The High Court certified that we had raised a point of law of general public importance , and that the Supreme Court has good grounds to hear

welcome the High Court \u2019 s decision to allow Julian Assange the right to appeal his extradition case to the Supreme Court .\nThis case will have enormous implications for journalism and press

11 , 2019 .\nHe faces 18 charges\u201417 of which are charges under the Espionage Act .\nThe Espionage Act is a law in the United States passed in 1917 that the Justice Department has increasingly wielded against media sources who share \u201c classified \u201d documents or talk about sensitive information with journalists .\nOn December 10 , 2021 , the High Court , the same court which was asked to certify points of law for an appeal , granted the U.S. government \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision that previously blocked Assange \u2019 s extradition .\nThe High Court was \u201c satisfied \u201d with \u201c diplomatic assurances \u201d offered by the U.S. government related to how Assange would be treated in jail or prison , and they stated , \u201c There is no basis for assuming that the U.S.A. has not given the assurances in good faith.\n\u201d In the request to appeal to the Supreme Court , Assange \u2019 s legal team asked the High Court to certify that the court \u2019 s approach to the \u201c diplomatic assurances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential jail and prison conditions , was a matter worthy of review .\nAssange \u2019 s attorneys further maintained that Supreme Court review was necessary on the issue of whether the court erred in accepting \u201c diplomatic assurances \u201d that would be \u201c inhuman for someone suffering from his mental disorder.\n\u201d But the High Court declined to certify those as \u201c points of law \u201d that were of \u201c public importance.\n\u201d The U.S. government offered \u201c diplomatic assurances \u201d after they lost their case when District Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extradition would be oppressive for mental health reasons .\nAccording to the \u201c diplomatic assurances \u201d put forward , the U.S. government would not impose special administrative measures ( SAMs ) on Assange before trial or after he was convicted .\nYet that assurance contains a major loophole .\nIf Assange commits a \u201c future act \u201d that meets \u201c the test \u201d for SAMs , the U.S. may designate him for such restrictive confinement conditions .\nThey did not specify what type of acts might justify revoking this assurance .\nThe U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designated for ADX Florence , a supermax prison in Colorado .\nSimilarly , they indicated if Assange commits a \u201c future act \u201d that meets the \u201c test for such designation \u201d he could still be confined in a maximum security prison .\nProsecutors pledged to allow Assange to apply for a prisoner transfer to Australia to serve his U.S. sentence under the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons , but that does not necessarily mean they would grant an application for transfer .\nThey merely informed the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is a meaningless gesture .\nIf Assange was extradited and held in a U.S. jail or prison , the U.S. pledged to ensure he receives \u201c clinical and psychological treatment \u201d as recommended by a \u201c qualified treating clinician employed or retained \u201d by the facility where he is held .\nHowever , the assurance ignored the reality that if a facility lacks resources or the psychologist or staff does not conclude that Assange needs a higher level of care , he may not receive treatment .\nOn the \u201c point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certified , Assange \u2019 s attorneys stated , \u201c The introduction of fresh \u2018 evidence \u2019 in support of an appeal against an adverse ruling , in order to repair holes identified in that ruling , is generally prohibited.\n\u201d They noted prior cases .\n\u201c Quite apart from everything else , profound issues of natural justice arise where assurances are introduced by the requesting state for the first time at the High Court stage , \u201d the attorneys added .\nAssange \u2019 s attorneys further suggested the Supreme Court may want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on judges to call for assurances rather than proceeding to order discharge , \u201d which is how Baraitser ruled .\nIn December , the High Court concluded Baraitser \u201c ought to have notified \u201d the U.S. government that she was going to \u201c discharge \u201d the case against Assange so that prosecutors could offer \u201c assurances \u201d before her decision .\nDeclassified U.K. reported days before the High Court ruled in favor of

a paid subscriber and help us expand our work .\nAn extraordinary Danish Radio report exposed how scores of children in Denmark , many of them orphans , were subject to CIA-funded experiments for at least two decades .\nThe purpose of these activities remains unknown , as authorities continue to actively suppress the truth of what happened in the 1960s and early 1970s .\nThe startling expos\u00e9 is based on the work of documentarian Per Wennick , who was one of 311 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children never learned the objective of the tortuous assessments to which they were exposed , even after they ended .\nSuch trials are in conflict with the Nuremberg Code , which enforces the vital requirement of obtaining consent from human subjects in all medical research .\nAccording to Wennick , when he was 11 years old , he was asked at an authoritarian orphanage in Copenhagen if he wanted to try something \u201c fun \u201d at the local municipal hospital .\nIt was vaguely described as an examination of how children \u201c feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome diversion , he acquiesced and even received a small sum for his participation .\nWennick went on to undergo a series of regular tests , which included being forced to listen to recordings on headphones of loud noises , screams , and statements intended to scare him .\nStaff strapped him to a chair while electrodes were placed on his arms , legs , and chest , measuring his heart rate , temperature , and sweat levels .\nThese experiments continued until 1973 , when Wennick was 24-years-old .\nHowever , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to a skin complaint , he learned his visit\u2014in fact , his every contact with healthcare services\u2014 was reported to the Danish Psychological Institute for reasons never made clear to him .\nFast forward to 2018 .\nWhile at a film festival in the United States , he saw the documentary \u201c Three Identical Strangers , \u201d which tells the story of triplets deliberately separated at birth and offered up for adoption to families of differing socioeconomic backgrounds , in a covert and highly unethical scientific \u201c nature versus nurture \u201d study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been unwittingly caught up in a similar experiment .\nThe Search For More Records On Human Experiments Diligent digging in local archives unearthed a number of papers revealing that the project in which Wennick became embroiled was the brainchild of Zarnoff A. Mednick , a U.S. psychologist interested in what distinguishes schizophrenic patients from neurotypical people and patients with other disorders .\nDenmark was an attractive testing ground .\nUnlike the U.S. , it boasted a central population register , meaning participants could be tracked over the course of many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schulsinger , constructing a study of 207 children with schizophrenic mothers , and a control group of 104 children without schizophrenic mothers , including Wennick .\nHe sought to ascertain how many would develop schizophrenia and how it might manifest .\nOver a third of the participants were orphans .\nIn 1977 , Schulsinger published a doctoral dissertation on the project .\nDenmark \u2019 s Ministry of Justice intervened to ensure , contrary to standard practice , he was not required to undertake a \u2018 viva , \u2019 which is a public defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey \u2019 s background a secret .\nHaving piqued his curiosity , Wennick went off in search of more records related to the experiments .\nEventually , he identified 36 boxes of material stored in the basement of a psychiatric center in a Copenhagen suburb .\nHe asked Josef Parnas , a psychiatrist he interviewed for his documentary series , to assist him .\nBut when the center learned of his request , it began shredding the documents , on the alleged basis it was unable to store research papers after a project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a violation of Danish law..\nThere are further reasons to doubt the psychiatric center \u2019 s stated rationale .\nThe project was lavishly funded and received around $ 700,000 when adjusted for inflation .\nRoughly a quarter of that money flowed from the Human Ecology Fund , a CIA front and outgrowth of QKHILLTOP , one of a cluster of mind control programs launched by the agency in the 1950s to study alleged communist brainwashing techniques and develop interrogation strategies .\nIt was eventually absorbed into the notorious MKULTRA .\nThis may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel psychological exams , the Danish children were also subject to extensive physiological and mental assessments .\nIn one of the Fund \u2019 s experiments , participants had to agree or disagree with around 600 different statements , a test originally designed to screen soldiers for fascist sympathies around World War II .\nScant information is available publicly on QKHILLTOP \u2019 s dimensions even today , although an academic paper published in June 2007 shed significant light on the Human Ecology Fund \u2019 s cloak-and-dagger activities .\nOriginally named the Society for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded in 1954 by Harold G. Wolff .\nA renowned neurologist and leading authority on stress , migraines , and bio-physiological mechanisms of human pain , he was personally recruited for the project by CIA chief Allen Dulles , who fostered business in Adolf Hitler \u2019 s Germany .\nThereafter , the Society provided sizable financing to social scientists and medical researchers , primarily in furtherance of the CIA \u2019 s behavior modification and persuasion goals .\nThey also identified \u201c specific cultural information \u201d about Cold War enemy populations , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of intense study .\n\u201c Both pleasure and pain were areas of interest for those studying interrogation , \u201d the paper recorded .\nProjects were awarded smaller grants that likely had no intelligence or national security applications but provided the organization with \u201c a necessary false appearance of legitimacy for the public and the academic community , \u201d such as studies on cranial analysis and Puerto Rican migration .\nA 1963 CIA Inspector General review of MKULTRA opaquely noted that in certain cases academics employed under its auspices \u201c may be aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program .\nIt added \u201c experience has shown that qualified , competent individuals in the field of pharmacological , physiological , psychiatric , and other biological sciences are most reluctant to enter into signed agreements of any sort which connect them with this activity , since such a connection would jeopardize their professional reputations.\n\u201d Langley got around this problem by simply keeping most participating scientists in the dark as to the agency \u2019 s role in commissioning the research program .\nThey hoodwinked scientists and hid the malign purposes behind their labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950s the Human Ecology Fund bankrolled a trip to Nigeria for psychiatrist Raymond Prince to undertake \u201c transcultural psychological studies.\n\u201d Prince had no idea the CIA intended for his work to \u201c add somewhat to our understanding of native Yoruba psychiatry , including the use of drugs , many of which are unknown or not much used by Western practitioners.\n\u201d and \u201c assist in the identification of promising young [ redacted ] who may be of direct interest to the agency.\n\u201d He later concluded that overseas trips sponsored by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and collect data \u201c on cultures and countries of interest to the CIA for psychological warfare purposes.\n\u201d Seemingly innocuous surveys of the personality types and family structure of Chinese nationals residing in the U.S. could be maliciously exploited , \u201c to identify disgruntled refugees with suitable personality profiles who had fled the communist regime 10 years earlier and might be persuaded to act as CIA agents back in China.\n\u201d Research findings from the Fund \u2019 s assorted initiatives furthermore appear to have provided major components of the CIA \u2019 s 1963 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which advocates the use of electric shock , threats , fear , sensory deprivation and isolation , repeatedly cited the work of Human Ecology-supported scholars .\nAs historian Alfred W. McCoy recorded , most confirmed MKULTRA research efforts did not actually relate to propaganda or brainwashing at all but involved physical and psychological torture techniques .\nIt is , therefore , disturbing that the Fund \u2019 s 1961\u20131963 progress report lists several studies related to childhood , which it supported , such as \u201c conceptual development in children and young adults.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , given the document discusses how , when its assorted techniques are applied , \u201c the usual effect\u2026is regression , \u201d and a subject \u2019 s \u201c mature

CIA torture techniques , which were employed in recent years ?\nAgency chemist Sidney Gottlieb , who headed MKULTRA from its inception until retiring in 1973 , died in March 1999 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that targeted leaders in the Global South .\nA New York Times obituary quoted a nameless Langley operative as saying MKULTRA specifically targeted mental patients , prisoners , drug addicts , and

government explicitly contended the public interest defense proposal may \u201c undermine \u201d efforts to \u201c prevent damaging unauthorized disclosures , which would not be in the public interest.\n\u201d Ultimately , the government \u2019 s \u201c fundamental concern \u201d is that \u201c a person seeking to make an unauthorized disclosure , whether in government or otherwise in possession of official material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to accurately judge whether the public interest in disclosing the information outweighs the risks against disclosure.\n\u201d In other words , to the government , no individual , journalist , or government employee is capable of making a decision as to whether a leak is in the public interest so there should be no public interest defense for leaking or publishing government documents without official approval .\nTim Dawson is a former president and longtime member of the National Union of Journalists ( NUJ ) .\nHe also has covered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dawson , the proposed changes to the law would make the environment for public interest journalism \u201c significantly more hostile \u201d .\n\u201c The NUJ believes that where civil servants take great risks to leak information it is almost always because they have witnessed incompetence , waste , or corruption .\nExposing such things is in the public interest and benefits us all , \u201d Dawson declared .\nNormalizing The Prosecution Of Journalists Like Assange The U.K. government does not believe that \u201c there is necessarily a distinction in severity between espionage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position they made clear when responding positively to the recommendation that the maximum prison sentence for unauthorized disclosures be increased .\nAlthough the Law Commission itself doesn \u2019 t recommend a new maximum sentence , the current figure under discussion and being pushed by the Crown Prosecution Service in its submissions is 14 years .\n( Note : This is the institution helping the U.S. government obtain the extradition of Assange . )\nIn the U.S. , a violation of the Espionage Act carries a maximum sentence of 10 years .\nSomeone guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be punished more harshly .\nThe U.K. government believes both \u201c primary and onward disclosures have the potential to cause equal amounts of harm \u201d , meaning that publications by a journalist or member of the public of information leaked to them or even already published in the public domain such as online should be treated the same under the law .\nProposals also seek to apply some of the provisions of the Official Secrets Act to government workers and \u201c notified persons \u201d outside of the U.K..\nThe government clearly has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stating that in some cases the state \u201c should be able to consider prosecution against non-British citizens for unauthorized disclosure , who have caused damage.\n\u201d This is precisely what the U.S. government is doing with Assange through the extraterritorial application of the Espionage Act against a journalist and publisher , who was based in the U.K. at the time of the disclosures in question .\nThe fact that the government has responded to the Law Commission \u2019 s recommendations in the context of a further consultation on countering \u201c hostile state \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it comes to the matter of whistleblowing and national security journalism .\nOfficials would like whistleblowers and national security journalists to be treated as severely as actual acts of espionage by a \u201c hostile \u201d state power , if not more so , in some cases .\nFormer NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed warrantless mass surveillance by the U.S. , U.K. , Canada , Australia and New Zealand .\nWaste , fraud , and abuse was exposed by Chelsea Manning .\nThe publication of this information by WikiLeaks and various media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corruption and resulted in numerous successful legal challenges in the U.S. and Europe .\nYet it is this very kind of whistleblowing and journalism , which would become substantially more difficult if the current proposals were to become law .\nNational security reporting , which is adversarial to state power , is already suffering an immense chilling effect in the U.K. , as noted by Reporters Without Borders ( RSF ) in its response to the Law Commission .\nIn 2018 , Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey , two investigative journalists based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the armed police .\nThe arrests followed the airing of Alex Gibney \u2019 s documentary \u201c No Stone Left Unturned , \u201d which examined the role of British state collusion in the 1994 Loughinisland pub massacre of six Catholics by loyalist paramilitaries .\nThe two were accused of breaching the Official Secrets Act when they used leaked documents in the film .\n\u201c When a knock came to the family \u2019 s door , Sheila looked out and saw what appeared to be about 30 armed police officers , uniformed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Statewatch recounted : \u201d The house quickly filled up with police .\nHis eight-year-old became frightened and began to sob .\nBirney , who had , like McCaffrey , to shower and dress in front of an officer , told his wife he was being arrested , and was taken away.\n\u201d Although the two were freed after a judge threw out their arrests , it is widely believed the targeting of journalists will inevitably increase with the proposed expansion of the Official Secrets Acts .\nOnce the U.K. government formally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the official secrets legislation , \u201c those defending civil liberties in the U.K. will have yet another fight on their hands , \u201d Jones concluded .", "author": "Mohamed Elmaazi", "url":

Coup Plot Disinformation For United States", "content": "This article was funded by paid subscribers of The Dissenter Newsletter .\nBecome a monthly subscriber to help us continue our independent journalism .\nMonths of frenzied speculation about an imminent Russian invasion of Kiev by Western journalists , think tanks , and politicians culminated on February 15 with Moscow reducing its military footprint near Ukraine \u2019 s border .\nThe withdrawal came one day beforePresident Joe Biden \u2019 s administration inexactly forecast a phantom incursion .\nPanic was stoked to a perplexing degree .\nAtlantic Council representative Melinda Haring declared on February 11 that Russian President Vladimir Putin had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine , including cutting off the nation \u2019 s power and heat , knocking out its entire navy and air force , killing a number of general staff in order to install a pro-Russian president , and resorting to \u201c full-scale military invasion if Ukraine doesn \u2019 t give in.\n\u201d When none of this came to pass over the weekend , Haring meekly claimed emotions were \u201c running high , \u201d and she \u2019 d \u201c let them get the better \u201d of her .\nShe said she would be \u201c more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of \u201c Russian trolls , \u201d and as Russia withdrew forces , she conveniently reframed the narrative .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve been so focused on Russian troops and tanks that we missed Moscow \u2019 s strategy : strangle Ukraine \u2019 s economy and sap the resolve of its people.\n\u201d Almost as baffling and bizarre was British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss boldly asserting on January 22 that London possessed \u201c information \u201d indicating Moscow planned to forcibly install a puppet government in Kiev .\nForces would invade Ukraine and mount a coup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukrainian politicians with alleged links to Russian intelligence .\n\u201c The information being released today shines a light on the extent of Russian activity designed to subvert Ukraine , and is an insight into Kremlin thinking , \u201d Truss stated .\nWhen asked to substantiate the claims , British officials were at a loss , and also refused to clarify how the information was obtained and verified .\nThese claims rapidly circulated .\nThe New York Times praised Britain \u2019 s reckless inflaming of a highly volatile situation as \u201c muscular.\n\u201d But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no evidence \u201d to support the bombshell allegations .\nIn an ironic twist , Yevhen Murayev , a former Ukrainian MP named by London as the Kremlin \u2019 s pick for President , expressed amusement and dismay.\n\u201c You \u2019 ve made my evening .\nThe British Foreign Office seems confused , \u201d he told the Observer while laughing .\n\u201c It isn \u2019 t very logical .\nI \u2019 m banned from Russia .\nNot only that , but money from my father \u2019 s firm there has been confiscated.\n\u201d Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead in withdrawing its embassy staff from Kiev .\nYet hours later , a senior European diplomat made clear European Union member states would not withdraw , adding snidely there was no need to \u201c dramatize \u201d the situation while talks with Moscow continued .\nThe Washington Post added to the confusion on January 29 when they quietly revealed that intelligence underlying Truss \u2019 shock announcement was \u201c collected and declassified \u201d by the US , and the Biden administration had specifically asked British authorities to publicly expose the purported plot .\nOddly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allies , such as Germany , where officials consistently expressed skepticism toward the notion that Russia would invade Ukraine .\nNowhere in the Post \u2019 s coverage did the newspaper ask a very obvious question\u2014why was the disclosure of the incendiary material outsourced in this manner ?\nBritain \u2019 s laundering of US intelligence created the illusion that an ally had independently reinforced dodgy claims from US officials of an imminent Russian invasion .\nIt allowed Washington to recast the December transfer of 90 tons of \u201c lethal aid \u201d to Ukraine as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruse provided plausible deniability in the event that the false narrative unraveled , as it inevitably did .\nThe Biden administration knew very well that London could be relied upon .\nAt the conclusion of World War II , a Foreign Office official ruefully concluded that a bankrupt Britain \u2019 s future lay in serving as \u201c junior partner in an orbit of power predominantly under American aegis.\n\u201d Ever since , the UK government has consistently gone further than most countries in serving Washington interests.In September 2021 , Yahoo !\nNews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war plans \u201d to kidnap or even assassinate WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange if he attempted to leave the Ecuador embassy in London for Moscow .\nThe report contained a shocking example of Britain \u2019 s willingness to do the bidding of US intelligence .\n( Note : Assange \u2019 s legal team says Assange was opposed to Ecuador \u2019 s proposal to assign him to a diplomatic post in Moscow . )\nScenarios to thwart Assange \u2019 s escape included \u201c gun battles with Kremlin operatives on the streets of London \u201d and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian plane carrying Assange before it could take off for Moscow.\n\u201d US officials reportedly \u201c asked their British counterparts to do the shooting if gunfire was required , and the British agreed.\n\u201d The British also took the leading role in producing propaganda ahead of the US invasion of Iraq .\nAs far back as 1998 , MI6 \u201c black propaganda specialists \u201d were involved in \u201c psychological warfare \u201d known as Operation Mass Appeal , according to former United Nations weapons inspector Scott Ritter .\nThe foreign spying agency circulated \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help shape public opinion about Iraq and the threat posed by WMD [ weapons of mass destruction ] .\n\u201d \u201c We have some outlets in foreign newspapers \u2013 some editors and writers who work with us from time to time \u2013 where we can spread some material , \u201d MI6 representatives told Ritter .\n\u201c We just need to be kept informed on what you are doing and when , so we can time the press releases accordingly.\n\u201d A particularly controversial British intelligence assessment claimed Iraq President Saddam Hussein was capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 minutes .\nIt turned out the source was a lone Iraqi taxi driver .\nThe claim was repeated in a televised speech by President George W. Bush in September 2002 and proved fundamental to the war in Baghdad two months later .\nBritish intelligence led the way in fomenting the US-led conflict against Syria in August 2013 , after opposition-controlled Ghouta was allegedly struck by rockets fired by government forces containing the chemical agent sarin .\nThe incident had the hallmarks of a false flag operation .\nUS officials were forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly a \u201c slam dunk , \u201d and communications intercepted by German spies indicated that whatever happened , Syrian President Bashar Assad \u2019 s government had not sanctioned or been aware of the attack .\nHowever , the British Joint Intelligence Committee possessed no such doubts and declared it was \u201c highly likely that the Syrian regime was responsible , \u201d and \u201c there [ were ] no plausible alternative scenarios.\n\u201d This resulted in a parliamentary vote on launching military intervention in Syria ( alongside Washington and Paris mere days later ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of Western military action against Damascus off the table .\nUkraine is a country where Britain consistently seeks to influence events in order to derive economic , political , and military benefits .\nFor example , leaked documents indicate London funded consultants to effectively market neoliberal labor \u201c reforms \u201d to the Ukrainian public , which would destroy employment rights and protections .\nThe Foreign Office also financed Ukraine \u2019 s StopFake , a purported \u201c fact-checking \u201d website with deep links to fascist elements in the country .\nStopFake defended Ukrainian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run by the Neo-Nazi militia Azov Battalion .\nThey also defended Andrey Parubiy , a Ukrainian parliamentary speaker from 2016 \u2013 2019 Parubiy is an avowed Adolf Hitler fan .\nWhen Parubiy visited Britain in 2018 , local reporters sprang to his defence .\nHe was implicated in a reported false flag massacre of Maidan protesters in February 2014 .\nEven more significantly , the Foreign Office is secretly co-opting journalists and media organizations in Kiev via funding , training , and the surreptitious production of anti-Russian , pro-Western , and pro-NATO content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d was one suggested example of programming to support in leaked internal files .\nThese efforts are a component of a \u00a3100 million clandestine drive by London to \u201c weaken the Russian state \u2019 s influence \u201d over its neighbors .\nAll of which is another facet of Britain \u2019 s bond with the US that has been absolutely fundamental : relations between Moscow and Washington must remain tense .\nBy presenting itself as a dependable bastion of European security , Britain can remain relevant globally , able to perpetually piggyback off its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , London was willing to circulate bunk US intelligence about an impending Russian invasion of Ukraine .\nFittingly , in the wake of Moscow \u2019 s announcement that it would withdraw troop deployments from some annual military exercises , Britain \u2019 s notorious Sun tabloid published an \u201c exclusive \u201d stating Russia was still planning to invade at 1 am London time on February 16.No \u201c massive missile blitz \u201d happened so the Sun updated the \u201c exclusive \u201d to say \u201c Putin continued to keep the West guessing.\n\u201d The article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said officials were \u201c preparing for the worst , \u201d believed an invasion \u201c highly likely , \u201d and \u201c over the next few days there could be an attempt to claim the Ukrainians are attacking them so the Russians have a justification for invading.\n\u201d \u201c Certainly , our latest intelligence suggests that an invasion is imminent , that it \u2019 s highly likely , and that we \u2019 ve seen 100,000 troops stationed around the border , \u201d Truss fulminated .\n\u201c We would expect multiple sequenced attacks and not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the brink of a war in Europe .\nThat would have severe consequences not just for the people of Russia and Ukraine but also for the broader security of Europe , \u201d Truss added .\nSuch fearmongering has been de rigeur since 1946 , when British Prime Minister Winston Churchill delivered an iconic speech at Westminster College in Fulton , Missouri .\nChurchill warned that communism posed \u201c a growing challenge and peril to Christian civilization.\n\u201d Without \u201c a special relationship between the British Commonwealth and Empire and the US , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAt the time , opinion polls indicated American citizens not only valued and trusted their Soviet ally far more than Britain , but they foresaw a much-reduced role for the latter in world affairs following the war .\nChurchill \u2019 s comments were poorly received , but their impact was quickly apparent .\nSix months later , US-Soviet cooperation collapsed due to disagreements over the future of occupied Germany .\nWashington became wedded to a hardline anti-Soviet policy , and the Cold War was launched .", "author": "Kit Klarenberg", "url":

response to conditions including only being allowed to leave their cells for 30 minutes a day .\nThe jail is located in downtown Riverside , a mini-metropolis of more than 310,000 people that serves

19 days , with no noticeable change in conditions or policies .\nVenegas helped orchestrate that one and later assisted in organizing another two years later .\nAn August 2019 complaint [ PDF ] Venegas filed against Bianco and the county while he was incarcerated in the RPDC states that he and 15 others \u201c initiated a collectively peaceful protest in the form of a hunger strike \u201d on January 14 of that year .\nDuring the intentionally multi-racial action , detainees refused food \u201c to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deemed punitive.\n\u201d The suit mentions a 13-page letter that outlined the concerns of hunger strike participants and served as an attempt to facilitate \u201c diplomatic dialogue between inmates and those responsible for participants \u2019 health and safety , and to edify them of illegal policies that can be corrected without litigation.\n\u201d Damon Anderson ( no relation to this reporter ) said he engaged in four separate hunger strikes while in RivCo custody and coordinated collective actions with Venegas .\nHe said correctional staff subsequently targeted them both for insubordination .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and searching our cells every day that we

refused food for 16 days several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declined to eat .\nThe men in the RPDC started receiving a bit more dayroom time as a result of their own hunger strike in January , Yolanda Velasco , who is no longer in custody , wrote after she and the other women ended their hunger strike in mid-July 2019 .\n\u201c We had put multiple [ grievances in ] to be treated fairly .\nThey would not budge .\nSo we [ decided ] to take drastic measures , \u201d Velasco wrote .\nChantel Cox , who participated in the hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted all formal remedies , like grievances and appeals

completely out of hand.\n\u201d But , Cox added , she , Velasco and two other women stood their ground and in so doing managed to disrupt what had gone on so long it was \u201c normal routine \u201d there .\n\u201c As a form of retaliation deputies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote , \u201c and legal work went missing on 3 occasions.\n\u201d The California Department of Corrections ( CDCR ) has a documented history of staging \u201c gladiator fights , \u201d pitting incarcerated members of opposing gangs or men with bad blood between them against each other in state prisons .\nSimilar sorts of guard-coordinated fights have taken place within RivCo jails .\nVenegas told Shadowproof he was forced to fight a man inside one of the county jails in February 2017 .\nA jail gang investigator at what was then called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Cois M. Byrd Detention Center \u2013 threatened to have him assaulted because he was on a hunger strike , he explained .\n\u201c I took that threat seriously and I knew that these threats would be accomplished .\nThe deputies often manipulate the surveillance cameras to omit evidence of such incidents and only save the video footage to prosecute cases against inmates .\nThe Grand Jury ( 2017-2018 ) made note of this fact in their reports , \u201d Venegas wrote .\nHe was referring to the Grand Jury \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2017 \u201c were not provided because they had been reported lost due to a failure of the recording device.\n\u201d Venegas recalled being warned by several detainees that deputies wanted to set him up and have him assaulted when he \u2019 d least expect it .\n\u201c The jail allows me almost 30 minutes a day to shower , use the phone , throw my trash and watch T.V .\nand I am confined to my cell 23 \u00bd hours a day , \u201d Venegas wrote .\n\u201c While on the phone talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with my back towards the sally port slider door .\nAnd behind me [ a deputy ] opens the door.\n\u201d He believes the deputy deliberately opened the door and let in a guy who was housed in Dayroom 3 .\nTrying to run did not work , Venegas explained .\n\u201c I knew that at any moment the [ Sheriff \u2019 s officers ] were going to set me up , \u201d he wrote .\n\u201c When I saw this [ 6-foot , 11-inch tall ] individual at the entrance I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assault .\nAnd I didn \u2019 t want to be the victim .\nThis guy was 6-11 , almost 7 feet tall , a giant to my [ 5-foot , 8-inch ] stature .\nHe had two stabbing instruments in each of his hands.\n\u201d If the other man attacked him in the relatively wide dayroom space , Venegas believed his defense would suffer , so he needed to contain him inside the sally port .\n\u201c I was a boxer in my youth , \u201d he continued .\n\u201c I competed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBeing raised in the California Youth Authority , I further learned to defend myself and fight smart.\n\u201d The other guy hit his own shoulder on the side of the entrance , according to Venegas , who noted he needed to take advantage of the opening .\n\u201c I capitalized and hit him 2 or 3 times \u2026 until he [ collapsed ] and fell to the floor , \u201d Venegas explained .\n\u201c I walked away and resumed my phone call with my family .\nIt took the deputies several minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes , to respond to the incident.\n\u201d He thinks the deputies presumed they would find him beaten senseless and therefore took their time to respond .\nHe \u2019 s not the only one to face physical violence inside RivCo jails .\nAnderson said he acquired a misdemeanor charge after a deputy inside the RPDC told him jail staff would leave him alone and give him his own cell if he assaulted a guy officers disdained because the man was filing lawsuits against the county .\nAnderson did but said he shouldn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being harassed on the seventh floor of the facility .\n\u201c And that type of shit happens all the time , \u201d Anderson said .\nBut , he added , he \u2019 s also been on the receiving end of sadism inside there .\nAt one point , while downstairs in holding at the RPDC , Anderson suffered an unidentified medical incident he assumes was a seizure .\n\u201c I woke up with all these officers around me , and I didn \u2019 t know what was going on , \u201d he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , he said , and they dragged him out of there by handcuffs .\nMarlo McGee , who is incarcerated at RPDC , wrote that she \u201c witnessed an inmate who had been \u2018 jumped \u2019 by three men.\n\u201d The individual was \u201c absolutely ignored by medical staff after returning from ICU at the hospital .\nHe sustained multiple fractured ribs , facial fractures , and several other injuries .\nWhen he got back to the jail , he was given absolutely no pain medication for several days.\n\u201d Maurice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jails before being sent to Corcoran , corroborated the trend , noting he \u2019 d also witnessed men intentionally sent to housing units where they would be assaulted .\n\u201c One man while at the Cois Byrd Detention Center had his face and body sliced so bad with razors he didn \u2019 t look human , \u201d Jennings wrote , adding : \u201c I was forced to witness a young man beaten and hazed unconscious while at the Banning Detention Center , \u201d otherwise known as the Larry D.

Board of Supervisors to decrease the footprint of the Sheriff \u2019 s Department.\n\u201d Nolasco noted the department also patrols a lot of the county because several municipalities in the area do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim , then , is to diminish the RCSD \u2019 s foothold by encouraging cities to stop contracting with them without replacing them with another police force .\n\u201c All They Do Is Pull Teeth \u201d Beyond a reduction in the RCSD budget , sources and records intimate an urgent need to , in lieu of immediate mass release of people controlled by RivCo custody , improve the medical

of accomodations , he fell from a top bunk as well as in the shower at Indio \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he writhed in agony , Anderson averred that his \u201c cries for help were ignored and even laughed at.\n\u201d He recalls being in so much pain he curled up crying on the floor one morning in June 2017 , and a nurse told him he couldn \u2019 t see the doctor if he couldn \u2019 t walk .\n\u201c I wrote a suicide note saying please tell my wife and mother I \u2019 m sorry but I can not take this pain no more , \u201d Anderson recounted .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take my own life.\n\u201d He woke up in the emergency room and told the doctor he would rather die than continue to endure the pain and humiliation he had been subjected to in the jail .\nThe mistreatment prompted him to file lawsuits against the county .\nAnderson said he was treated worse inside RivCo jails than he had ever been in jails in Los Angeles , Sacramento , Santa Barbara or San Luis Obispo counties .\nMcGee told Shadowproof some of the worst aspects of RivCo jails include not having input @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not being taken seriously by staff who often minimize medical complaints .\nCorrectional staff seem to believe incarcerated persons do not deserve competent care , she lamented .\n\u201c I witnessed a woman withdrawing from heroin having seizures and the medical staff simply looked down at her and said she was faking , \u201d McGee wrote , adding : \u201c If you have a medical issue on the weekend that is not an emergency , the vast majority of nurses will not call the doctor on call to get the patient medication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors are in the jail .\nThey also allow your medication to expire \u2013 leaving you without meds for several days.\n\u201d Her father , Ernie McGee , a citizen of Riverside County since 1962 , said his daughter , who has sickle cell disease , has frequently had to fight to see a doctor .\nMcGee said the disease has caused his daughter intense , excruciating pain , but staff did not expedite treatment .\n\u201c And myself , well they used to completely ignore me when I \u2019 d have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father advocated for me , they no longer ignore me , \u201d his daughter , who still struggles to receive appropriate medical care for her condition , explained .\nHer father said she started receiving blood transfusions about every four weeks when a specialist finally arrived .\nBut then they transferred the doctor to UC Irvine , putting a halt to her treatments .\nThe elder McGee spoke with jail and hospital staff before the doctor specializing in sickle cell left , but to no avail .\n\u201c She suffered her first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited so long , \u201d he said .\nHe also chided the abject misery of dental care on the inside .\n\u201c All they do is pull teeth , \u201d McGee said .\n\u201c They don \u2019 t put in crowns.\n\u201d His daughter agreed , saying dental treatment only includes extractions , dentures , and fillings .\nProcedures dentists agree are essential to the maintenance of oral health , like a deep cleaning every few months , are denied .\nDisability and illness are also used as justification for withholding food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition to the two suits he settled and the one still in litigation , Anderson explained that he lost a separate lawsuit he filed after jail staff denied him food when he was in too much pain to get dressed .\nThe same repressive RCSD tactic provoked a lawsuit [ PDF ] from McGee , who claims the RPDC deprived her of food \u201c as punishment for violating jail policy without due process.\n\u201d She violated policy because her disease made it difficult to get fully dressed when staff demanded , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would burn .\nOur noses would burn.\n\u201d In Venegas \u2019 s view , his problems with RivCo jails started when he was first booked and assigned the adverse \u2018 ad-seg \u2019 classification based on alleged prison gang validation without due process circa 2014 .\nWhen detainees are booked , they remain inside intake holding cells for days , Venegas told Shadowproof .\n\u201c The holding tanks are very unsanitary , \u201d he explained .\n\u201c The tanks are extremely cold .\nMany inmates sleep on the floors , which are filthy .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilets and sinks are constantly [ malfunctioning ] .\nMost inmates do not complain of the unsanitary conditions because deputies threaten them to not house them for days for complaining.\n\u201d After submitting numerous grievances without a response , Raymundo Ramirez filed a lawsuit [ PDF ] against the county of Riverside , the Sheriff and the Undersheriff in July 2021 .\nThe complaint includes four grievances submitted throughout February 2021 when Ramirez , who is now in the Orwellian-named Pleasant Valley State Prison , was incarcerated at the Cois M. Byrd Detention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cell with toxic waste water that kept pouring in my cell , \u201d Ramirez wrote on one of those grievance forms , dated February 13 , 2021 .\nDeputies stepped in the waste water , which splashed onto the fruit and milk on his meal tray , he wrote .\n\u201c They would feed us in the cells with it being flooded , \u201d he told Shadowproof .\n\u201c Our eyes would burn .\nOur noses would burn.\n\u201d Anderson corroborated claims about poor sanitation , specifically lambasting the literal shit with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c While at RPDC on the medical floor none of the cells got cleaned and even the showers were known to have [ feces ] in them on a regular basis , \u201d Anderson wrote .\nShit showed up in the shower on several occasions , but staff typically did not view it as a pressing problem .\n\u201c A minimum of 15 times I \u2019 ve gone there and there \u2019 s a turd , just right there on the floor , \u201d he said .\nHe recounted how one time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deputy about excrement in the shower only to find it there on the floor the next day .\nAccording to Venegas , persons suffering from mental illness would urinate and defecate inside both showers and cells , and indifferent correctional deputies consistently let the problem pile up , leaving detainees without sufficient cleaning supplies to deal with or dispose of it .\n\u201c Toilets had a known problem of spilling into the adjacent cells , \u201d he shared .\n\u201c For example , when my neighboring cell would flush his toilet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cell .\nMany times I [ awoke ] to feces and urine flooding my cell.\n\u201d Anderson wrote that when he told a deputy in the Banning facility he wanted to file a grievance to challenge the jail \u2019 s policy of making detainees clean showers and toilets without gloves , deputies rushed into the living quarters and destroyed personal belongings .\nThey told everyone that would happen daily if they continued to grieve , he added .\nIn early 2022 , Anderson wrote that RivCo jail staff told detainees writing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snitch \u201d and that grievances are further discouraged by incarcerated persons willing to assault those who complete the paperwork .\nIn exchange for roughing up other prisoners , Anderson claimed deputies provide those persons with extra meals , additional phone calls , and a variety of other privileges .\nSince the RCSD failed to protect the incarcerated as the pandemic raged despite receiving millions of dollars for COVID-19 relief , members of the RAOUON chapter launched a # ReleaseRiverside campaign , urgently demanding releases .\nThey \u2019 ve also repeatedly called on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheriff \u2019 s Department .\nA movement to # BootBianco emerged in June 2020 to demand defunding the RCSD and to raise awareness about the sheriff treating people as disposable .\nA Sacramento-based anonymous member of the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee ( IWOC ) of the Industrial Workers of the World \u2013 an anti-capitalist union that endorses prison abolition \u2013 said solidarity with those inside is more important than those outside often realize .\nThe organizer said IWOC , which does not yet have a Riverside branch or local , generally focuses more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere are also welcome to join .\nThose on the inside often express greater interest in becoming a member of a militant union working toward the abolition of incarceration and class society than do those who have never been locked up .\nAbolition and solidarity also require more than advocacy aimed at getting the government to release a lot of people from jails and prisons .\n\u201c If we \u2019 re not about social revolution and overthrowing capitalism , then we \u2019 re basically not about shit , and it \u2019 s literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sacramento IWOC member said , adding : \u201c Is the state ever going to just abolish its repressive wing just because you ask it to ?\nObviously fucking not.\n\u201d Rodriguez , who last year helped formalize an Inland Empire Abolition Network \u2013 a coalition of persons and organizations across the region who support each other \u2019 s work geared toward transforming justice and getting rid of police , prisons and jails \u2013 stated resistance among jailed persons indicates those targeted by local state violence have \u201c no choice but to adopt whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and publicize the severity of their situation.\n\u201d \u201c It is an obligation for those of us professing to be on the right side of history , or in support of true justice , to build public solidarity with these struggles !\n\u201d Rodriguez proclaimed .\nAnderson offered suggestions for those facing the Herculean task of transforming power relations on the inside through direct action and disobedience , be it with hunger strikes or other synchronized efforts .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re going to organize something like that now , you just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hit \u2018 em all with it all at once , and do it that way , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Otherwise , they \u2019 re going to do to them like they did with me and Venegas and keep us separate from the general population just for that purpose.\n\u201d As McGee made clear , the humans held under RCSD authority , ripped from the communities from whence they came , try to contact each other \u2019 s loved ones as needed and inform them about what goes on inside there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to staff on behalf of the inmate in need but are usually met with \u2018 mind your own business , they can speak for themselves , \u2019 \u201d she added .\n\u201c We will care for one another to the best of our ability \u2013 provide food , OTC medication and emotional support.\n\u201d Beyond calling for additional rehabilitation programs , greater freedoms for detained persons , and access to technology like tablets that could make confinement a bit more bearable , McGee also encouraged community members outside of custody to listen closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free .\n\u201c I would advise the staff and activists to take the time out to consult with the inmates to understand better what their needs are , \u201d she wrote .\nFor his part , Venegas hopes to convey to all who might care that the RivCo jail system is constructed \u201c to break you in every conceivable way prior to a conviction \u201d so as to monopolize control over lives .\n\u201c So you better stand on solid ground because they aim to break you , guilty or not , \u201d @ @ @", "author": "James Anderson", "url":

talks to end the Russia-Ukraine war , Western countries are pouring gasoline on the fire .\nOn February 24 , delegations from Ukraine and Russia met on the Ukraine-Belarus border near the Pripyat river .\nIt was the first round of negotiations since Russian military forces invaded Ukraine .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ which lasted nearly five hours .\nYet the two delegations agreed to meet again on March 2 near the border between Poland and Belarus .\nAccording to Al Jazeera English , Vladimir Medinsky , the head of the Russian delegation , said there were \u201c certain points on which common positions could be foreseen.\n\u201d Ukraine \u2019 s delegation was not as optimistic .\n\u201c The talks were taking place against the backdrop of bombing and shelling of our territory , our cities .\nSynchronizing of the shelling with the negotiating process was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put pressure [ on Ukraine ] with this simple method , \u201d Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared in his evening address on February 28 .\nPrior to the talks , French President Emmanuel Macron was urged by Ukraine to speak to Russia President Vladimir Putin .\nThe Guardian reported that he asked \u201c Putin to ensure that for the duration of the negotiations all strikes and attacks on civilians and their homes would be halted , civilian infrastructure would be preserved , and all main roads\u2014particularly the road south out of Kiev\u2014would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed .\nVideos of Russia attacking Kharkiv with \u201c short- to medium-range , truck-mounted multiple-rocket launchers \u201d known as \u201c Grads \u201d were posted to Telegram the day of talks , leading numerous media outlets to report on the shelling as a violation of Putin \u2019 s pledge to Macron .\nYet it was unclear if Russian military forces \u201c synchronized \u201d the attack with negotiations .\nPutin told Macron a ceasefire would be possible if there was \u201c unconditional consideration of Russia \u2019 s legitimate security interests , \u201d such as : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Organization ( NATO ) , the demilitarization and \u201c de-Nazification \u201d of Ukraine , and \u201c recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea.\n\u201d He was open to negotiate with Ukraine \u2019 s representatives on these terms .\nWhile there are armed neo-Nazi groups in Ukraine , perceived as a problem in recent years , Putin has exaggerated their influence over Ukraine \u2019 s government .\nZelenskyy \u2019 s election diminished the mobilization of the far right ( though generally they have enjoyed a resurgence during the war ) .\nOf course , Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their military forces and respect Ukraine \u2019 s sovereignty .\n\u2018 Diplomacy At The Barrel Of A Gun \u2019 State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters at a briefing that Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba consulted with G7 ministers ahead of the negotiations .\nZelenskyy spoke to President Joe Biden , and Biden talked with Kuleba .\nU.S. officials compared notes and coordinated closely .\nThis may explain the U.S. State Department \u2019 s skepticism .\nIt does not appear the U.S. has advised Ukraine to offer Russia an offramp , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special combat readiness.\n\u201d \u201c You would be right to color us skeptical of what it is that Moscow intends .\nWhat we \u2019 ve said before , including last week , applies equally today .\nDiplomacy at the barrel of a gun , diplomacy at the turret of a tank \u2013 that is not real diplomacy , \u201d Price stated .\nIn fact , the U.S. is a hegemon that uses its vast military power to advance a worldwide agenda .\nAlexander L. George , who was globally renowned for his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The proposition that force and threats of force are a necessary instrument of diplomacy and have a role to play in foreign policy is part of the conventional wisdom of statecraft.\n\u201d \u201c Diplomacy is not an alternative to military force ; it is the use of all elements of U.S. force in a coordinated , cumulative way to achieve our results in other countries , \u201d former U.S. ambassador to Iraq James Jeffrey told Defense One in 2014 .\nJeffrey was a diplomat in Iraq after President George W. Bush preemptively invaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , Jeffrey said , \u201c I saw them do major groundbreaking diplomatic initiatives that were revolutionary , but those guys were kicking ass and deploying military forces as an integral part of their diplomacy.\n\u201d \u201c That is why they were successful in their diplomacy , and I don \u2019 t see any difference between the two\u2014negotiating agreements and threatening force , and when necessary delivering on the threat , \u201d Jeffrey added .\nElementary school children in the United States are taught the concept of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was promoted by President Theodore Roosevelt .\nHe relied on the military strength of the U.S. to seize land and build the Panama Canal .\nHe had the Great White Fleet travel from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean in a show of force to deter Japan from expanding their dominance in Asia .\nThe reality is the U.S. may pursue peace by flaunting its monopoly on violence , but any adversarial power will be condemned for acting similarly .\n\u201c We are ready and willing , just as our Ukrainian partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , to engage in real , in substantive , in genuine diplomacy in order to see if we can find a way out of what is a needless , brutal conflict , \u201d Price said .\n\u201c But that diplomacy is highly unlikely to bear fruit , to prove effective , in the midst of not only confrontation but escalation.\n\u201d It is absurd to spell this out , but ceasefires are only necessary during conflicts that involve confrontations and escalations of violence .\nDiplomats negotiate to establish a stoppage in warfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty may be established .\nDiplomats may pursue a ceasefire to prevent catastrophic events that could result in a substantial amount of death .\nPreventing further death does not necessarily equal appeasement .\nNevertheless , British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss parroted the U.S. State Department

other areas.\n\u201d A former agency official spelled out the purpose of this program bluntly : \u201c the US is training an insurgency \u201d to \u201c kill Russians.\n\u201d This program has palpable parallels with \u201c Operation Gladio \u2019 , \u201d a clandestine pan-European nexus of NATO , CIA , and MI6-supported fascist guerrilla units , which throughout the Cold War carried out false flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heinous crimes with impunity for over four decades , as part of a \u201c strategy of tension \u201d to discredit the left , and justify ever-greater security measures .\nAmong other atrocities , Gladio operatives were responsible for the August 1980 bombing of Bologna train station , which killed 85 people , including a three-year-old child , and wounded over 200 .\nMembers of Gladio \u2019 s Italian unit were trained on British soil , and the CIA and MI6 provided the explosives used in the massacre .\nIt also bears similarities to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the Soviet\u2013Afghan War .\nIn fact , such a comparison was drawn by U.S. lawmaker Adam Smith , chair of the House Armed Services Committee , after legislation to establish a \u201c Ukraine Resistance

Afghanistan.\n\u201d \u201c The day that the Soviets officially crossed the border , I wrote to President Carter : We now have the opportunity of giving to the USSR its Vietnam war , \u201d the strategy \u2019 s architect Zbigniew Brzezinski bragged in 1998 .\n\u201c For almost 10 years , Moscow had to carry on a war unsupportable by the government , a conflict that brought about the demoralization and finally the breakup of the Soviet empire.\n\u201d However , the Afghan fighters \u2019 role in the USSR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historians\u2014and Melvin Goodman , chief of the CIA \u2019 s Office of Soviet Affairs during this period\u2014to be hugely overrated , if not an outright fantasy .\nWhat the policy primarily achieved was a wantonly protracted and bloody quagmire , in which thousands of people died needlessly .\nThe very same horror is likely to play out in Ukraine too .\nZelenskyy has armed Ukrainian citizens and circulated instructions for making Molotov cocktails , urging the public to hurl improvised explosives at the invading Russians\u2014potentially putting civilians \u2019 lives at risk by making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this encouragement purportedly resulted in a battery of BM21 Grad MLRS inadvertently detonating and devastating the surrounding area .\nIn another , a Ukrainian woman who flung a Molotov cocktail at a Russian army vehicle from a moving car set herself on fire in the process .\nAdd to this incendiary mix an influx of foreign fighters , one of whom told NPR of their desire to \u201c hang from lamps as many Muscovites as I can , \u201d and Ukrainian authorities releasing inmates with military experience from prison to fight invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been transformed into a veritable tinderbox , primed to explode in a gruesome manner .\nWhen civil war erupted in Tripoli in 2011 , London offered an \u201c open door \u201d to Libyan exiles residing in the country \u2013 including members of MI6-connected Al Qaeda-affiliate Libyan Islamic Fighting Group .\nThese fighters proved pivotal in the brutal overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi , and remained in Libya for years thereafter .\nIn 2014 , several were rescued by a Royal Navy vessel due to a \u201c deteriorating security situation.\n\u201d Among the evacuees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2017 perpetrated a suicide bombing in Manchester Arena , killing 22 , injuring over a thousand , and leaving hundreds suffering from psychological trauma .\nThe EU estimates that up to seven million refugees will be created by the war in Ukraine .\nThat number likely does not account for a future where an insurgency turns the war into a \u201c ten year event.\n\u201d The world can expect some who flee and take up refuge in Western countries will be battle-hardened and embittered former guerrilla fighters , like Abedi .\nClearly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons that should be learned from previous protracted wars .\nNo matter the global consequences , London and Washington will fight to the last

.\nAccording to Birnberg Peirce , the law firm representing Assange , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Home Secretary for consideration before the extradition request is approved .\nIf Patel approves the extradition , Assange \u2019 s defense may submit an appeal on the issues of freedom of the press that were not addressed before the High Court yet .\nThat would likely prevent Assange from extradition .\nHowever , if the High Court and Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal because they did not believe it raised \u201c arguable points of law , \u201d he could potentially be transferred to the U.S. before the year is over .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Prison Belmarsh in London , a high-security prison where he has been held since he was expelled from the Ecuador Embassy on April 11 , 2019 .\nHe faces 18 charges\u201417 of which are charges under the Espionage Act .\nThe Espionage Act is a law in the United States passed in 1917 that the Justice Department has increasingly wielded against media sources who share \u201c classified \u201d documents or talk about sensitive information with journalists .\nOn December 10 , 2021 , the High Court , the same court which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appeal , granted the U.S. government \u2019 s appeal and overturned a district court decision that previously blocked Assange \u2019 s extradition .\nThe High Court did not grant permission for an appeal but certified one issue as a \u201c matter of public importance , \u201d which cracked the door open for an appeal before it was slammed shut on March 14 .\nThe district court heard evidence during a month-long hearing in September 2020 that U.S. prison conditions would likely drive Assange to commit suicide , particularly as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. agencies that provides input into whether to designate a detainee or prisoner for SAMs is the CIA , which designated WikiLeaks as a \u201c non-state hostile intelligence agency \u201d and reportedly considered

justice objectives.\n\u201d Assange \u2019 s legal team asked the Supreme Court to consider what circumstances an appeals court could receive \u201c assurances \u201d from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the \u201c court of first instance in extradition proceedings.\n\u201d ( In this case , that was the Westminster Magistrates \u2019 Court . )\nFollowing District Judge Vanessa Baraitser \u2019 s decision to block the extradition request , the U.S. State Department put forward assurances to save their case.Officials told the British government they would not impose special administrative measures ( SAMs ) on Assange before trial or after he was convicted .\nThey also insisted they would not incarcerate Assange in ADX Florence , a supermax prison .\nAdditionally , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian citizen , could apply for a prisoner transfer under the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons to Australia to serve any prison sentence in his home country .\nHe would also receive \u201c clinical and psychological treatment \u201d as recommended by a \u201c qualified treating clinician employed or retained \u201d while in U.S. custody .\nEach of the conditional assurances offered by the U.S. State Department contained glaring loopholes that were highlighted by Assange \u2019 s attorneys during an appeal hearing at the end of October 2021 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be insignificant , and the court granted the U.S. government \u2019 s appeal .\n\u2018 Regressive Measures \u2019 Which Have No Place In A Democracy An application for appeal released by Assange \u2019 s legal team reflects the arguments they were blocked from presenting to the Supreme Court .\n\u201c The manner in which assurances were permitted to be introduced in this case for the first time on appeal totally undermines the primacy of the extradition hearing and deprives the defendant of an opportunity to test them and their implications before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c It is generally regarded as unfair , wrong , and abusive for a party to elect\u2014for a perceived or actual tactical advantage\u2014to conduct litigation in one way and then , when met with an adverse judicial decision on that , to attempt to re-litigate or appeal on a new and different basis.\n\u201d The High Court asserted the assurances were not evidence , and as such , there was no unfairness on the part of the U.S. government .\nIn response , Assange \u2019 s attorneys raised the fact that there lengthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisons , which gave the U.S. plenty of opportunity to neutralize concerns about inhuman treatment .\nOfficials never offered an assurance related to SAMs or ADX Florence .\nEvidence presented by Assange \u2019 s defense clearly resonated with Baraitser .\nOnly then did U.S. officials accept that the state of U.S. jails and prisons may require them to make some assurances to secure the WikiLeaks founder \u2019 s extradition .\nAccording to Assange \u2019 s attorneys , withholding assurances from the district judge meant that there was no opportunity for the judge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also no chance for the judge to take into account the assurances when \u201c reaching her overall value judgments.\n\u201d \u201c Assange was , of course , in custody throughout the entire proceedings below , and parachuting this issue into these proceedings , at this remove of time , was fundamentally unfair , \u201d his attorneys added .\nJulia Hall , Amnesty International \u2019 s deputy research director for Europe , called the Supreme Court decision a \u201c blow to Julian Assange and to justice.\n\u201d \u201c Prolonged solitary confinement is a key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. maximum security prisons and amounts to torture or other ill treatment under international law .\nThe ban on torture and other ill-treatment is absolute and empty promises of fair treatment , such as those offered by the U.S.A. in the Assange case threaten to profoundly undermine that international prohibition.\n\u201d Hall also contended the refusal left \u201c intact the nefarious route the U.S. has employed to attempt to prosecute publishers for espionage .\nDemanding that states like the UK extradite people for publishing classified information that is in the public interest sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Reporters Without Borders ( RSF ) expressed deep disappointment in response to the Supreme Court \u2019 s decision .\n\u201c Assange \u2019 s case is overwhelmingly in the public interest , and it deserved review by the highest court in the U.K. After two full years of extradition proceedings , once again Assange \u2019 s fate has become a political decision , \u201d stated Rebecca Vincent , RSF \u2019 s Director of Operations and Campaigns .\n\u201c We call on the Home Office to act in the interest of journalism and press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from prison without further delay , \u201d Vincent added .\nWhile press freedom issues in the Assange case have not been litigated since the district court decision , the first major changes to the U.K. \u2019 s Official Secrets Acts since 1989 were proposed by Patel , who supports expanding the law to prosecute and jail whistleblowers and journalists who publish state secrets .\n\u201c Although the Official Secrets Acts are indeed long overdue for reform , what the Home Office is proposing is alarming , \u201d Vincent previously declared .\n\u201c The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would increase risks for journalists , sources , and others who could face the threat of up to 14 years in prison simply for

the United States and sent the request for his extradition to Home Office Secretary Priti Patel for approval .\nThe order came a little more than a month after the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom refused to hear Assange \u2019 s appeal .\nIn December , the UK High Court of Justice granted the US government \u2019 s appeal and overturned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief Magistrate Senior District Judge Paul Goldspring contended he was \u201c duty-bound \u201d to send the extradition request to Patel .\nGoldspring also told Assange he had a right to appeal if the Home Office approved the extradition before issuing the order .\nMark Summers QC , an attorney for Assange , asserted there were \u201c fresh developments \u201d in the case and bemoaned the fact that the defense was not permitted at this stage to raise this evidence , according to Computer Weekly \u2019 s Bill Goodwin .\nAssange \u2019 s legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence to the Home Office and argue why the department should block the extradition request .\nIn two months , Patel is expected to make a decision.If approved by Patel , attorneys for Assange may request permission to appeal to the British High Court of Justice .\nHis attorneys may appeal the decision of the district judge to send the case to the Home Office for approval and may also appeal the Home Office secretary \u2019 s order .\nWhile the defense for Assange objected to District Judge Vanessa Baraitser \u2019 s ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it related to issues of press freedom , they never had an appropriate opportunity to raise their objections .\nShe denied the extradition request after determining it would be \u201c oppressive \u201d for mental health reasons .\nHis attorneys would likely challenge many of Baraitser \u2019 s conclusions about Assange if Patel allowed the request .\n( Note : Baraitser is no longer a district judge at the Westminster Magistrates Court . )\nAssange is detained at Her Majesty \u2019 s Prison Belmarsh .\nHe faces 18 charges brought against him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are under the Espionage Act .\nAll the charges relate to documents WikiLeaks released in 2010 and 2011 , which were provided by US Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning .\nThe prosecution makes Assange the first publisher to be charged under the 1917 law , and globally the case has been condemned by virtually all reputable civil liberties , human rights , and press freedom organizations .\nPatel and the Home Office support an expansion of the Official Secrets Laws in the UK , which Elmaazi reported \u201c would expand possible imprisonment for

for MI5 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police operations .\nOperation Pelican , the name for the pressure campaign to force Assange out of the Ecuador embassy in London , was supported by the Home Office .\nBut as

act now to protect journalism and adhere to the UK \u2019 s commitment to media freedom by rejecting the extradition order and releasing Assange.\n\u201d RSF , a global press freedom organization ,

a piece of cardboard that hung in a Massachusetts window in November 2021 read like a rallying cry for any number of movements .\nThe sign could \u2019 ve been in protest of inadequate responses to the climate crisis or COVID-19 .\nBut it had nothing to do with either ; it was a response to the poisoned drug supply and overdose crises .\nThese crises have been worsened over decades by policies that are either indifferent to the need for comprehensive solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criminalization and policing of drug users .\nOver the past three decades , people who use drugs have recognized this policy program as one of organized abandonment : a concept used by Ruth Wilson Gilmore and others to explain how the profit-seeking organization of business and government exploits and neglects specific populations deemed to be surplus or unproductive .\nIt can look like governments prohibiting the distribution of clean and safe equipment for using drugs , or forcing people to work without enacting basic public health protections to stem the spread of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFrom New York City , to Vancouver , British Columbia , to the midwest in Iowa , they \u2019 ve gathered together to determine what they need to live well and in safety , and then worked cooperatively to build those things .\nSome of these struggles are visible and above-ground , like the establishment in the early 2000s of Vancouver \u2019 s safe injection sites and , more recently , the Drug User Liberation Front [ DULF ] \u2019 s distribution of tested and safe drugs in the city .\nSome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and secret , like underground syringe exchanges and community-run safe injection sites .\nMost of these solutions were at one point illegal .\nSome have since been approved and/or co-opted by the state ( depending on how you look at it ) after years of conflict and prohibition , while others still operate under threat of incarceration .\nBut while politicians maintained policies that resulted in drug user deaths , drug-user organizers worked to stop as many deaths as possible .\nNow , states around the world are broadening their programs of organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with harm and death through their roles in overlapping crises from the pandemic to the climate emergency .\nMore communities are struggling to figure out how best to survive .\nDrug-user organizers know how to fight back and get what they need when they \u2019 re left to die .\nThe skills and experience these organizers have built are increasingly relevant for grave new contexts .\nIn 2003 , Cameroonian historian and political theorist Achille Mbembe coined the term \u201c necropolitics \u201d to describe the power of the state to normalize and enforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , and especially how racism and white supremacy shape that power .\nWhile the context is different , Garth Mullins , the host of the Crackdown podcast and organizer with the Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users ( VANDU ) , uses the term to describe government policies toward people who use drugs .\n\u201c It \u2019 s the power to decide who lives and dies , \u201d says Mullins .\nIn British Columbia where Mullins lives , this power is exercised with lethal results each year .\nSince 2016 , recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than doubled and it is likely this figure is an undercount .\nLast year , more than 2000 people died .\nMullins and his cohort learned long ago that they were on their own , and it was up to them to protect one another .\nHe came to drug-user organizing in Vancouver in the 1990s , when the province had declared a public health emergency in response to a spike in overdose deaths from potent heroin alongside rising HIV deaths .\nThe provincial government was holding out on needle distribution .\nTo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear : \u201c \u2018 Oh , they don \u2019 t care if we die .\nIt doesn \u2019 t matter to them.\n\u2019 \u201d The policy didn \u2019 t sit well with him .\n\u201c I guess I thought of my own life as not very valuable either , \u201d says Mullins .\n\u201c I thought , \u2018 well , maybe I don \u2019 t care if I die also.\n\u2019 If all the structures around you treat you like you \u2019 re not very valuable or useful , then you start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attending meetings with fellow drug users in the city , gatherings that would eventually lead to the creation of VANDU .\nAt these meetings , demands and analyses weren \u2019 t tempered by expectations of what the state might consider to be \u201c realistic , \u201d nor were they limited to what was legal .\nPeople could speak the truth of the situation and decide how to proceed with shared understanding .\nThis sort of organizing created liberatory actions and projects like North America \u2019 s first illegal safe injection site , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMullins argues these actions , determined internally according to their own needs , serve two purposes .\nThe first is immediate and material : they save and positively impact lives on that day .\n\u201c There kinda can \u2019 t be even a bigger unit of success than someone not dying , \u201d says Mullins .\nBut the other result is just as powerful .\n\u201c It also shows you and everyone around a little glimpse of a possible future , \u201d he said .\n\u201c This future has had the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , and now we \u2019 ve just taken a pry bar , popped that lock , and had a little glance through into what \u2019 s possible.\n\u201d \u201c Across the board , the state has just decided they \u2019 re abandoning people and they can die , \u201d says Mullins .\n\u201c Maybe they \u2019 re gon na die of COVID , maybe they \u2019 re gon na die in climate emergencies like the heat dome , maybe they \u2019 ll die of overdose.\n\u201d Like Mbembe \u2019 s concept highlighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America know these policies to be baked into the Canadian and American states .\n\u201c It \u2019 s been here the whole time , \u201d says Mullins , \u201c and I think what we \u2019 re seeing is an expansion of that.\n\u201d Any drug user could likely rattle off a list of names of friends and loved ones who died along the bloody road to state concessions to efforts like legal safe injection sites and needle exchanges .\nTo add insult to injury , the state usually paints demands for basic survival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactic sows discord and encourages movements to water down their convictions .\nSarah Ziegenhorn , a founder and former organizer of Iowa Harm Reduction Coalition ( IHRC ) , was surprised by the intensity and character of resistance from state government while working with the group .\nFounded in 2015 and based in Iowa City , IHRC ran an underground syringe exchange while formally connecting people to treatments and services for HIV and hepatitis C. By 2019 , they were handing out a million syringes per year in a state of just three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nUndercover cops would come to their space , snap pictures of the group handing out syringes and Narcan , and email them to state legislators , who would then withdraw support for IHRC .\nHistorically , when drug-user organizers have built enough power , the government concedes to some degree and signals a willingness to negotiate .\nThe compromises that result from that process can be tempting , especially in desperate situations , but can result in services that are often judgemental , punitive , or too little , too late.. Ziegenhorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face of abandonment , this situation can produce a chilling effect by introducing a conservative sense of \u201c moral superiority \u201d to the work that influences people toward compromise .\n\u201c That can be a kiss of death in organizing if people decide to believe that , \u201d says Ziegenhorn .\nWhen she would go to meetings with elected officials to discuss IHRC \u2019 s work , Ziegenhorn would bring physicians who were newly supportive of harm reduction efforts .\nAfter meeting with politicians who chastised them for the efforts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 d be like , \u2018 Okay , my peers are saying this is wrong , we have to wait for the laws to change , it \u2019 s really dangerous to do these things that are illegal , this is crazy.\n\u2019 \u201d This characterization of basic material demands as radical and immoral helps to discredit ideas and undermine grassroots organizing against abandonment .\nThe key to avoiding this , says Ziegenhorn , is \u201c a really well-established network of people who trust each other and believe in one another and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have to be comfortable with sticking to a set of values , and remembering your grounding in things that are important to you , like one another \u2019 s wellbeing and happiness and ease of living , \u201d says Ziegenhorn .\n\u201c Doing things that clearly further those goals is not radical or too out there or crazy.\n\u201d Some drug users maintain that even though government negotiation and compromise can be thought of as an acceptable end goal of organizing , decisions made by and for impacted community members are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions .\nSessi Kuwabara Blanchard noticed fellow trans sex workers and drug users in New York City weren \u2019 t accessing harm reduction services that were available .\nThe reason was that providers operated on schedules that conflicted with that of sex workers .\nSo , she started a mutual aid group for trans sex workers using drugs .\nDo It Safe , Heaux !\n( DISH ! ]\n) and its members distributed harm reduction supplies to one another .\nWhen trans sex workers faced transphobia and judgment at Narcotics Anonymous programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group .\nBut for Blanchard , who is an organizer with VOCAL NY \u2019 s Drug Users Union , the clearest indictment of fighting for state policy concessions came when she wanted to get a prescription for Suboxone to transition from using heroin and fentanyl .\nShe called a telehealth Suboxone clinic that advertised rapid access , but was told on the call that she \u2019 d be contacted later with an appointment date .\nBlanchard , already experiencing withdrawal , began to cry .\nThe person she was speaking with hung up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most devastating feelings , \u201d Blanchard recalled .\n\u201c The clinic staff hanging up on me was the distilled , purest form of abandonment that I felt.\n\u201d The lesson was that even services that purport to work toward the same goals as militants will often only do so on their terms .\nBlanchard says one way to avoid being upended by this is to adopt and adhere to immediate local goals .\n\u201c We only have to work with what \u2019 s in front of us and how the world is set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Building trusting relationships with the people that are surviving the conditions they wish to change is the absolute first starting place .\nYou have to respond and strategize from the point of your everyday life.\n\u201d When hostile conditions like the climate crisis seem insurmountable , organizing can seem impossible , especially to people who are becoming acutely aware of their vulnerability .\n\u201c Any action that you consider to be unsuccessful , maybe it \u2019 s just not successful yet , \u201d Mullins said .\n\u201c If you asked this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1997 in the peak of the HIV and overdose deaths , it would \u2019 ve been several years into the campaign but there was no InSite on the horizon for years.\n\u201d \u201c Unfortunately , the timelines are really long .\nWe also were asking for Narcan for a long time , and finally getting that five to six years ago .\nBut there \u2019 s nothing about civil disobedience that need take a long time.\n\u201d Crises often scream for urgency , but trying to accomplish too much all at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tao , an organizer with VANDU and the Vancouver Tenants \u2019 Union , says that centering immediate material conditions is important to momentum and community cohesion .\nWhile VANDU \u2019 s primary emphasis is drugs , Tao says they view it as just one piece of a larger puzzle .\nSiloing the issues of class struggle , he says , allows the state to play \u201c whack-a-mole \u201d in suppressing them , so building impactful movements means starting from the bottom .\nTao adds that good organizing leaves room for people to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than chastising someone for falling behind on tasks or missing meetings .\nHe says that members often can \u2019 t make VANDU meetings because they \u2019 re busy trying to evade eviction , policing , or other forms of violence , and \u201c as the rising tide starts to swallow up our planet , this is gon na get more fucking crazy , and we \u2019 re gon na have to give each other a lot of forgiveness for not being able to do stuff.\n\u201d \u201c That is the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not meeting every Thursday night on Zoom at 7PM after a work day and spending an hour on introductions then getting two things done .\nThat \u2019 s not it .\nThe real organizing is being able to navigate really complex social relations.\n\u201d VANDU has a small ritual that keeps the long-term scope in focus : at the end of every meeting , regardless of size or length , they have a moment of silence and speak the names of people they \u2019 ve lost .\nThis can happen up to five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re in the downtown eastside and you \u2019 re literally losing hundreds of people in your life from drug toxicity , or you \u2019 re on a dying planet , we have to be able to mourn these things and not forget them , \u201d says Tao .\nEvery time he repeats his friends \u2019 names , he still tears up .\n\u201c It recommits me to the fight , \u201d he says .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a very practical method that we use , but it \u2019 s really important @ @ @

.\n\u201c You start getting the skin crawling and the shakes and sweaties , and then comes the defecating on yourself , [ you ] can \u2019 t make it to the bathroom to sit on the toilet and go .\nYou just go wherever you \u2019 re at .\nAnd it was horrible , \u201d R.G .\nsaid in a phone call , adding that at one point during his withdrawal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he wasn \u2019 t let out of his cell all night , despite the mess .\n\u201c Feces [ were ] all over the place .\nIt smelled in there , and the only reason they let me out was because some [ corrections officer ] said she couldn \u2019 t stand the smell of it , \u201d he said .\nAfter speaking with R.G .\nand other detainees who were forced into withdrawal in the jail , the New York Civil Liberties Union ( NYCLU ) filed a class-action suit against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ShadowProof has agreed to refer to those named in NYCLU \u2019 s legal actions by their initials to protect their identities . )\nThe lawsuit alleged the jail had imposed a blanket ban on medication for opioid use disorder and that its policy of denying non-pregnant detainees access to their medication violated protections against cruel and unusual punishment under the U.S. Constitution \u2019 s Eighth Amendment , the Fourteenth Amendment , and the American with Disabilities Act , as well as New York State Human Rights law .\n\u201c There is no good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M.C.\n\u2019 s request to continue medically necessary treatment for his disability , \u201d NYCLU wrote in the March lawsuit , referring to one of the plaintiffs representing the class .\nYet the experience of those incarcerated in Jefferson County was far from unique to that jail .\nDoctors and scientists have long known that medications for opioid use disorders ( MOUD ) are effective and safe treatments for opioid use disorders .\nThree drugs \u2014 buprenorphine , methadone , and naltrexone \u2014 are approved by the FDA for the chronic disease yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jails and prisons .\nSuboxone is a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone , the latter of which is used for reversing opioid overdoses .\nNew York City \u2019 s Rikers Island began an opioid treatment program in 1987 .\nThe National Commission on Correctional Health Care and the National Sheriffs Association both support implementing medication-assisted treatment in incarceration settings .\nYet while people with opioid use disorders disproportionately come into contact with the criminal justice system , they \u2019 re often forced into withdrawal at the beginning of their incarceration .\nOf the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , just 632 offer any form of medication for opioid use disorder , according to the Jail & Prison Opioid Project , an organization that tracks data and provides information about MOUD .\nThis lack of access to medication endangers incarcerated people .\nA 2018 study found that in the first two weeks after release from incarceration , those previously detained were 40 times more likely to die of an opioid overdose than people in the general population .\nYet studies have also shown that offering people MOUD reduces the risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torture , literally torture to go through withdrawal , \u201d said Dr. Jody Rich , who helped set up Rhode Island \u2019 s groundbreaking program to screen people for use disorder upon entry into the state \u2019 s incarceration system .\nA study of the program \u2019 s efficacy found a 61 percent decrease in post-incarceration deaths .\nPeople with opioid use disorder say the non-medication treatment options pushed by corrections institutions often don \u2019 t work .\n\u201c I have had experiences with non-medication treatment programs , but any success with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative thoughts and intense opioid cravings , \u201d R.G .\nwrote in testimony submitted to the court .\n\u201c Receiving a therapeutic dosage of Suboxone has been effective at managing my addiction .\nIt takes away those intense opioid cravings , regulates me , and helps me think positively .\nSuboxone makes me feel alive.\n\u201d Nearly 500,000 people died from opioids in 20 years between 1999 and 2019 , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\nEven set against the backdrop of constantly increasing death tolls , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staggering jump in opioid deaths .\nMore than 107,600 people died from drug overdoses in 2021 .\nDespite the well-established science about MOUD and consistently rising opioid deaths , lawyers and medical professionals told Shadowproof that the stigma and fear of the unknown still reign supreme over science .\nLegislation has begun chipping away at that stigma .\nA 2021 study from the O \u2019 Neill Institute at Georgetown Law found that 15 bills related to MOUD access in incarceration settings came into effect in \u201c recent years.\n\u201d When corrections departments implement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confront that stigma .\n\u201c Suboxone specifically had been kind of public enemy number one , from a correction standpoint , because that \u2019 s what staff were trained to seek out and , and control and address from illicit drugs sort of perspective , \u201d Ryan Thornell , the Deputy Commissioner of Maine Department of Corrections , said .\nAs the state \u2019 s [ prison ] system began planning to implement its MOUD pilot , they surveyed staff about their perceptions of addiction and medications to treat it .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common misconceptions , such as the belief that MOUD replaces one addiction with another .\n\u201c Access to the appropriate medications for the disease or illness really starts to address the underlying behavior issues we see in correctional facilities , \u201d Thornell said .\n\u201c Our assault rates have gone down , our disciplines have gone down , our trafficking and diversion issues have gone down , because again , we \u2019 re providing the necessary medical treatment to the population , in addressing what was probably the primary underlying issue contributing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Litigation has also made inroads .\nIn recent years , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , along with state partners , have levied lawsuits against jails across the country .\nSince 2018 , the ACLU has brought cases against jails in Massachusetts , Maine , and Washington to ensure that clients could continue receiving medication while in prison .\n\u201c It \u2019 s been in the last three to four years where you \u2019 ve seen some judicial movement that \u2019 s been positive , \u201d Tammie Gregg , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Prison Project , said .\nAfter the ACLU of Maine sued the state \u2019 s Department of Corrections and , in another suit , a county along the Canadian border , Governor Janet Mills signed an executive order to bolster the state \u2019 s response to the opioid epidemic .\nThe executive order included directives for the state \u2019 s corrections infrastructure .\nBetween July and December 2019 , the Department of Corrections ( DOC ) opened a pilot program that provided medication-assisted treatment to 72 people .\nIn the last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all facilities , Thornell said .\nUnlike many programs in the country , the Maine DOC also initiates treatment for people who were not already prescribed MOUD .\nBut efforts to force change through legal threat or the possibility of lawsuit have been stymied by courts .\nJudges may say that the litigation is premature because a person hasn \u2019 t entered the facility .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve run into so many cases where they \u2019 ve said it \u2019 s moot until you have a problem , \u201d Gregg said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , the federal Department of Justice issued forceful guidance clarifying its interpretation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) .\nThe guidance clearly states that preventing an incarcerated person from continuing MOUD prescribed before they were jailed would constitute a violation of the ADA .\n\u201c DOJ has been entering into really important settlement agreements with a number of healthcare entities that have been discriminating against people receiving medication for opioid use disorder .\nThey \u2019 ve all been important .\nBut this guidance brings it all together in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful signal , \u201d Sally Friedman , the senior vice president of legal advocacy at the Legal Action Center said .\nGregg agreed that the DOJ guidance could shift the way that judges approach their litigation .\n\u201c I think judges might see this guidance from DOJ as giving them a little bit more authority to act.\n\u201d Susan Nyamora , the president of the South Florida Wellness Network , called the guidance \u201c amazing \u201d and said it would help reinforce her organization \u2019 s efforts to treat substance use disorders as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery organization has worked to ensure that people can continue receiving MOUD treatment after they are arrested and enter incarceration facilities , and also receive care upon release .\nShe said that Florida \u2019 s Broward County Jail has heavily relied upon methadone and often placed people on 6-month taper plans .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think that we do that for other chronic health conditions .\nWe don \u2019 t tell a diabetic they can only be on medication for six months , \u201d Nyamora said , adding that she hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead the county to offer more robust services to detainees .\nLike in Broward County , many jails across the country may offer MOUD but limit the scope of treatment available .\nSome facilities rely heavily on one form of medication , even though individuals may not respond to that form of MOUD .\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Corrections only offers medication to detainees who have been prescribed MOUD for at least 60 days prior to their entrance into the incarceration system .\n\u201c The purpose of the procedure and the qualification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenance program , \u201d Pennsylvania Department of Corrections Press Secretary Maria Bivens wrote in an email .\n\u201c If an individual is coming in from the community and they are not on MAT maintenance in the community , they do not qualify for our maintenance program , \u201d Some incarceration systems will revoke access to medication as a behavioral punishment .\nOther times , medication is administered in a manner that undercuts its efficacy , as well as FDA recommendations .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re giving a sublingual medication , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Adrienne Abner , the MOUD/MAT Project Staff Attorney at the Pennsylvania Institutional Law Project , said .\n\u201c What we found is that the person has been given the sublingual strip to put under their tongue , and then told immediately to drink water .\nWell , that \u2019 s basically no treatment because they end up swallowing the medication , instead of the medication being absorbed.\n\u201d In a lawsuit that predated the class-action case , the NYCLU received a preliminary injunction against Jefferson County mandating that the county provide methadone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail .\nThe facility provided transportation for treatment but held him in solitary confinement for five months , in what the NYCLU has alleged is retaliation .\n\u201c He was counting out how many steps across his cell was .\nSo it \u2019 s like , six and a half steps or something , \u201d his partner said .\n\u201c He was just pacing back and forth in his cell for a couple of hours a day to get exercise because he wasn \u2019 t allowed out to exercise or anything like that.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond when contacted by email for this piece .\nTwo staff members from the sheriff \u2019 s department also did not return requests for comment .\nThis array of potential problems administering MOUD has led some medical experts and lawyers to stress that establishing treatment programs in corrections facilities should not be seen as a replacement for combating mass incarceration .\n\u201c We certainly would never argue that people are best off getting their [ substance use disorder ] care or any health care in a carceral setting , as opposed to in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But advocates stressed that further changes to federal restrictions could facilitate improved care for people receiving MOUD .\nThe Social Security Act currently prohibits the use of Medicaid funds to pay for services offered to incarcerated people .\nDoctors have argued that removing payment barriers would improve the care offered in incarceration facilities .\nEliminating the so-called inmate exemption would be a \u201c game-changer , \u201d Kevin Fiscella , who serves as the National Commission on Correctional Health Care \u2019 s liaison to the American Society of Addiction Medicine , said .\nAllowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthcare in prisons and jails would ease the financial burden of setting up new programs .\nDoing so could also improve medical standards , \u201d Fiscella said .\n\u201c Right now , if you don \u2019 t get federal dollars , you \u2019 re not you \u2019 re not subject to mandatory accreditation for the health care services.\n\u201d Though the Federal Medicaid Reentry Act would partially address this funding gap by allowing states to restart Medicaid coverage 30 days prior to an individual \u2019 s release , the legislation has stalled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began the approval process to ask the federal government to permit the use of Medicaid dollars for carceral health services .\nIf the request clears the state registry , then the state can submit the request to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , Tracie Gardner , the Legal Action Center \u2019 s Senior Vice President of Policy Advocacy , said .\nThe funding request seeks to address the critical transition period during which incarcerated people leave a corrections institution and are susceptible to overdosing .\n\u201c Right now , under Medicaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can \u2019 t even work \u201d with people who are incarcerated but will be imminently released , Gardner said .\nBut creating a link between treatment at a corrections center and in the community would alter the care landscape .\n\u201c In my mind , at least , Correctional Health and Community Health aren \u2019 t linked until the transitional period is literally like you \u2019 re scheduled to leave and the OTP that \u2019 s waiting for you has already started processing you before you \u2019 ve left the corrections center .\n@", "author": "Daniel Moritz-Rabson", "url":

character arcs , and which \u201c key talking points \u201d became part of the script .\nAdditionally , documents on \u201c Top Gun \u201d also show the United States military has long wanted this to be a major franchise .\nThe first \u201c Top Gun \u201d ( 1986 ) is often remembered as a recruitment bonanza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to reports of recruiters setting up tables and stalls outside movie

completed rehabilitation of the military \u2019 s image , which had been savaged by the Vietnam War.\n\u201d One of the more surprising details in the production history of \u201c Top Gun \u201d is that the acclaimed antiwar filmmaker Oliver Stone was offered the project .\nStone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently-released documentary , \u201c Theaters of War : How the Pentagon and CIA Took Hollywood.\n\u201d A few years later , when Stone was filming the second of his Vietnam war trilogy , \u201c Born on the Fourth of July , \u201d Tom Cruise told Playboy that he felt it would be \u201c irresponsible \u201d to make a \u201c Top Gun \u201d sequel , as it offered people a \u201c fairy tale \u201d view of military life .\nHe even joked that the film was so successful at recruiting young men that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War Three.\n\u201d Behind the scenes , a \u201c Top Gun \u201d sequel was in development for years , with provisional Pentagon approval , but the Tailhook sexual assault scandal killed the movie .\nDuring the 1991 Tailhook Conference at a hotel in Las Vegas , Navy and Marine aviators assaulted dozens of women and men over the course of several days .\nAn Inspector

the Navy said , \u2018 Get the hell out of here.\n\u2019 \u201d It wasn \u2019 t until 20 years later that \u201c Top Gun \u201d was resurrected .\nProducer Jerry Bruckheimer met with the Pentagon \u2019 s Hollywood liaison in summer 2012 , as well as with representatives from the different military branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corps shows , this was well before even a draft script was completed .\n\u201c Initial meeting indicated production will be looking for a large amount of aviation support across all branches , \u201d the report noted .\nThree years later , the project got moving and Navy reports mention that the writers were taken on a \u201c familiarization embark \u201d aboard a Navy ship , and in September 2015 , David Ellison , Bruckheimer , and Navy officials met \u201c to identify general story outline , desired research areas , and rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of the Navy \u2019 s Hollywood office authorized , \u201c Skydance Productions the opportunity to be escorted by a DoD project Officer to USN bases/units and meet with personnel with the intent to help develop character arcs.\n\u201d The writer and producers met with commanding officers and went on board the USS John C Stennis .\nThey also made research trips to talk to real-life Top Gun instructors .\nOver the following months , the Navy \u2019 s updates note \u201c Writer currently revising screenplay ,

finished and sent for formal military review until the following year .\nGiven their existing influence over the script , the Pentagon found , \u201c No major problems with the story line , \u201d though they did require \u201c some revision to characterizations and actions of Naval aviators.\n\u201d The screenplay was still in progress as the film began production , so the agreement authorized support on the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required that they could , \u201c Assign a senior staff post-command officer to review with public affairs the script \u2019 s thematics and weave in key talking points.\n\u201d Despite involvement in the script \u2019 s development for several years already , the military sought even more influence .\nThe Navy also allowed for \u201c internal and external

around the movie \u2019 s release .\nGiven their primary role in helping to make \u201c Top Gun : Maverick , \u201d the Navy was quite protective of their latest Hollywood mega-asset .\nThe addendums to the agreement include a separate document authorizing Marine Corps assistance because the Marine Corps was cut out of discussions on the film by the Navy .\nThis effort to muscle others out of the way and make the movie a solely US Navy-branded product extended to entering into social media spats with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Top Gun \u201d is prime cinematic real estate when it comes to promoting the military .\nThe image of a bunch of hard-drinking , women-chasing pilots living the high-octane life grabs our attention , but \u201c Top Gun \u201d also served as one of the first post-war movies .\nThe story was full of military characters , but it did not emphasise combat or bloodshed .\nBy constructing a wildly popular story far removed from the brutal consequences of military action , \u201c Top Gun \u201d helped expand the possibilities for Pentagon-sponsored films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full spectrum of Hollywood productions getting into bed with the world \u2019 s most destructive military .\nWithout \u201c Top Gun , \u201d we might not have seen the Pentagon widen its influence to include everything from \u201c Cake Boss \u201d ( 2009 ) to \u201c Fast & Furious \u201d ( 2009 ) and \u201c Godzilla \u201d ( 1998 ) .\nIn the original \u201c Top Gun , \u201d the only meaningful combat sequence comes at the end of the film , when the graduates of the elite pilot academy take on unidentified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious reference to the Chinese Air Force led to the 3D version of Top Gun being banned in China .\nThe \u201c Top Gun : Maverick \u201d script also makes repeated use of the phrase , \u201c It \u2019 s not the plane , it \u2019 s the pilot , \u201d which seems likely to be one of the Navy \u2019 s \u201c key talking points \u201d and a recruitment plug at a time when the US military is struggling with a pilot shortage .\nBoth the film and slogan are part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the era of drone warfare , when the majority of pilots speaking out are describing endless guilt and trauma at the sheer scale of death they \u2019 ve inflicted .\n\u201c All these kids must hate me , because they all signed on thinking they \u2019 re gon na be fighter pilots pulling broads

Would Jeopardize Press Freedom This article was funded by paid subscribers of The Dissenter Newsletter .\nTake 25 % off and become a monthly subscriber to help us continue our independent journalism All main political parties in the United Kingdom have called for immediate passage in Parliament of new measures to fight \u201c state threats , \u201d which would restrict press freedom and threaten civil liberties .\nThe parties claim that measures in this legislation are necessary to prevent the influence of Russian oligarchs and figures like Christine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was accused by MI5 of being a Chinese agent .\nMuch of the bill , however , has nothing to do with foreign interference and civil society groups have criticized the legislation .\nIn 2015 , the Cabinet Office requested that the Law Commission , an organization of individuals in the legal profession who advise the government , review the Official Secrets Acts , which apply to unauthorized disclosures of classified information .\nThe National Union of Journalists ( NUJ ) expressed concern , raising the government \u2019 s history of prosecuting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their members and criminalize the handling of classified information .\n\u201c The NUJ strongly believes that whistleblowers and journalists acting in the public interest should not be subjected to increased prison sentences for unauthorized disclosure offenses , \u201d the organization declared .\n\u201c We are particularly concerned that the [ UK ] Home Office appears to be recommending reforms , which would make it easier to prosecute journalists.\n\u201d Additionally , in 2020 , a committee in Parliament published their highly publicized \u201c Russia Report \u201d that analyzed alleged foreign interference in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a \u201c foreign influence registration scheme.\n\u201d Such a scheme would require individuals to register if they undertook certain actions at the behest of a foreign power .\nIf a person was found to be acting as an agent\u2014and had not registered with the government , authorities would have the power to imprison them .\nThis power was proposed despite the Russia Report \u2019 s failure to find any significant interference .\nIn fact , it merely asserted that MI5 had failed to investigate the issue .\nBoth proposed reforms were combined into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Security Bill.\n\u201d A first draft was introduced into Parliament onMay 11 .\nIn an accompanying statement published by the Telegraph newspaper , Home Secretary Priti Patel cited the case of Christine Lee as justification for the bill .\nMI5 sent an alert to all members of Parliament ( MPs ) in January 2022 accusing Lee , a Birmingham-based solicitor , of lobbying and making donations to MPs on behalf of the Chinese state .\nThe story was featured on both the BBC and the British commercial network ITV evening news on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s claims were uncritically reported .\nEach of the UK \u2019 s major papers ran the story and turned to Patel and other politicians who support the new measures for comment .\nIn a parliamentary debate three days later , multiple MPs from all of the most prominent political parties urged Patel to bring the new laws forward on the basis that a foreign agent registration scheme was necessary .\nSome even called for Lee to be arrested or deported .\nNews media and politicians in Australia in 2018 warned against MPs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSimilar legislation was rushed through their parliament .\nIt was sold as a measure against foreign interference but contained the same restrictions on journalists .\n( These similarities could be more than coincidence as Patel has been advised by the Australian government on the new laws . )\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine , the calls for new laws grew louder .\nA Guardian piece from mid-March quoted Yvette Cooper , the shadow home secretary , and Tom Tugendhat , chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee , who called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the basis that foreign agent registration was needed to combat the influence of Russian oligarchs .\nThe Liberal Democrats foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran said , \u201c It \u2019 s deeply concerning that we could be waiting for up to another year for these vital measures .\nWe all know that the existing counter-espionage legislation is unfit for the 2020s .\nIf ever there was a time to update it , it \u2019 s now.\n\u201d \u201c Just as the government fast-tracked the economic crime transparency and enforcement bill , they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Moran recommended .\n\u201c The Liberal Democrats stand ready to sit over weekends and Easter recess to get these vital measures through as quickly as possible.\n\u201d Typically , the process of passing legislation takes months or years as it is publicly scrutinized and debated .\nA briefing prepared for MPs acknowledged an expansion of the Official Secrets Act in 1911 , which made it illegal for all individuals ( not just civil servants ) to publish any government documents , was passed through the House of Commons in a single day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting season .\nThis was prompted by a fear of German interference , which according to an officially commissioned history was later found to be exaggerated by MI5 .\nIf the government takes opposition MPs up on their offer and repeats this history , there will be little time to analyze new additions to the legislation that were not mentioned during the consultation process .\nAs Patel outlined , the bill would give the government expanded authority to catch \u201c perpetrators \u201d before \u201c serious damage is done , and it will allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentences for foreign state backed crimes.\n\u201d A possible life sentence for whistleblowers and journalists handling classified information , if they are found to be working to benefit a foreign power , is in the legislation .\nText in the bill also indicates authorities would not have to necessarily prove an individual was working for a particular foreign power .\nThe measures may also apply extraterritorially to individuals outside of the UK .\nProtect , an NGO which supports whistleblowers expressed relief that the need to prove whistleblowers actions were damaging to national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Whether intended or probably unintended , whistleblowers based in the UK raising concerns either with foreign-based journalists or regulators/law enforcement could be caught up in prosecutions.\n\u201d \u201c So we \u2019 re relieved the

Cooling Centers Are Far From Enough", "content": "Facing Summer Heat , Activists Say Cooling Centers Are Far From Enough June 2022 will mark the one-year anniversary of the record-setting heat wave that killed over 500 people across Oregon , Washington , Idaho , and Canada .\nThe Pacific Northwest , known for cold , rainy winters and mild summers reached high temperatures in 2021 with 116 degrees Fahrenheit in Portland , Oregon and 121 degrees in Lytton , Canada .\nOregon \u2019 s Multnomah County saw the most deaths .\nAn analysis found most of the people who died were older , lived by themselves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas affected by this heatwave had cooling shelters available , including in public spaces like libraries .\nBut advocates argue that this is not enough .\n\u201c The idea of cooling centers is just , to me , this lack of understanding that where people live has got to be a core standard [ \u2026 ] especially when you are talking about older and disabled individuals , \u201d said Ruth Ann Norton , the CEO of the Green and Healthy Homes Initiative non-profit , which works to create safe , healthy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy advocacy .\n\u201c I know on the East Coast [ \u2026 ] one of the major COVID responses [ was ] emergency air conditioning , \u201d Norton explained , \u201c we had people stuck in their homes.\n\u201d \u201c Elderly individuals , a large part of them were already stuck \u201d prior to the pandemic , Norton said .\n\u201c And it was just this blind eye [ being turned to them ] .\n\u201d The 2021 heat wave revealed the unequal access to cool air in the homes of marginalized people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health issue with deadly consequences in the face of climate change .\nClimate specialists at World Weather Attribution say the Pacific Northwest heat wave would be a once-in-a-millennium event without climate change .\nThey predict more frequent , severe , and longer heatwaves like this in the future .\nThose without air conditioning , even in places that historically have not needed cooling systems , will continue to be at risk .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve got people living in environments now that [ \u2026 ] if we were still a nomadic people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norton .\n\u201c Because they have a home anchoring them , they are living in these incredibly hot boxes.\n\u201d In response to this weather event , governments in the Pacific Northwest have made efforts to expand access to cooling .\nOregon passed a law that took effect in March 2022 , which prevents landlords and homeowners associations from banning air conditioning units unless there is a legitimate safety concern \u2014 for example , if the AC unit were to be placed in a fire escape window .\nThe law also allocates funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and air purifiers to distribute to eligible individuals during emergency conditions , such as severe wildfire smoke .\nThe eligibility criteria , according to the law , requires individuals to qualify for medical assistance through Medicare , the Department of Human Services , or the Oregon Health Authority , or that they received any of these services within the last twelve months .\nThey must also have housing that has electricity for an air conditioner or purifier , and attest that they can install the units legally and safely .\nWashington state expanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by allowing money from the federally-funded Low-Income Housing Energy Assistance Program ( LIHEAP ) to be used for purchasing , repairing , or replacing air conditioning units .\nPreviously , those funds had only been approved to help with heating .\nThe Washington legislature introduced a bill that would have expanded the use of air conditioning in adult family homes .\nHowever , it was referred to the Ways and Means Committee and it stalled out by the time the legislative session adjourned in March 2022 .\nAccording to Norton , local action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing real change .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s state legislation that has the most impact \u2014 far more than even federal legislation , \u201d she said , \u201c although , federal leads the way for some of this.\n\u201d There may be room for the federal government to recognize and address the need for sufficient cooling in homes as the climate changes .\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development , for example , does not mandate that Public Housing Authorities need to include air conditioning in their units .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ available to pay for fixing air conditioning units , this service is not guaranteed at the national level .\nHow the money is implemented is up to states \u2019 discretion , and not all states allow the funds to be used in this way .\nIncreasing access to air conditioning units in homes is just one way of increasing thermal comfort on days of extreme heat .\nNorton says a more comprehensive approach is needed to improve housing conditions as a whole .\n\u201c You can install AC , \u201d Norton starts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventilation on the house , you \u2019 ve got to not have leaky roofs and windows , right ?\nSo that [ having the AC ] matters.\n\u201d Taking a holistic approach to creating \u201c healthy homes \u201d has multiple benefits .\nFor example , increasing ventilation in a home can reduce the amounts of Volatile Organic Compounds , tobacco smoke , radon , and allergens someone is exposed to , which can also improve health outcomes in vulnerable communities .\nNorton is hopeful that climate-resiliency policies that improve access to AC and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the home will gain traction .\n\u201c For agnostics about climate change , the climate-related investments in housing bear out on their own [ \u2026 ] we are improving generational wealth , \u201d Norton explained , \u201c We may improve [ the residents \u2019 ] longevity .\nBut what we are really improving is their quality of health while they \u2019 re alive and the value of their home when they pass on

planned to submit an appeal in the High Court of Justice challenging the political nature of the case and how extradition law was interpreted .\nDescribing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borders international campaigns director Rebecca Vincent said the decision represented \u201c another failure by the UK to protect journalism and press freedom , bringing Julian Assange a step closure to extradition.\n\u201d The global human rights organization Amnesty International renewed their opposition .\n\u201c Allowing Julian Assange to be extradited to the US would put him at great risk and sends a chilling message to journalists the world over.\n\u201d Don \u2019 t Extradite Assange , a campaign which mobilized opposition to the case in the UK , stated , \u201c This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for British democracy .\nAnyone in this country who cares about freedom of expression should be deeply ashamed that the Home Secretary has approved the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States , the country that plotted his assassination.\n\u201d Assange faces 18 charges brought against him by the US Justice Department , 17 of which fall under the Espionage Act .\nAll the charges relate to documents WikiLeaks released in 2010 and 2011 , which were provided by US Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning .\nOver 300 doctors , psychiatrists , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctors for Assange \u201d sent a letter to Patel on June 10 that reminded Patel of \u201c serious concerns \u201d related to the WikiLeaks founder \u2019 s \u201c deteriorating health , \u201d which has worsened while in UK custody .\n\u201c Under conditions in which the UK legal system has failed to take Mr Assange \u2019 s current health status into account , \u201d the doctors declared , \u201c no valid decision to approve his extradition may be made by you or anyone else.\n\u201d The doctors made it clear that extraditing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medically and ethically unacceptable.\n\u201d They added , \u201c Should he come to harm in the US under these circumstances , it is you , Home Secretary , who will be left holding the responsibility for that negligent outcome.\n\u201d Nineteen organizations committed to freedom of expression and press freedom wrote a letter to Patel on April 22 , right after the district court ordered Assange \u2019 s extradition and sent it to the Home Office for review .\n\u201c [ Assange

applied to any media outlet that published stories based on leaked information , or indeed any journalist , publisher , or source anywhere in the world.\n\u201d \u201c We ask you , Home Secretary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment to protecting and promoting media freedom and reject the US extradition request .\nWe ask you to release Mr Assange from Belmarsh prison and allow him to return to his young family after many years of isolation .\nFinally , we ask you to publicly commit to ensuring that no publisher , journalist or source ever again faces detention in the UK for publishing information in the public interest.\n\u201d The organizations demanded a meeting with Patel , but it does not appear a meeting was ever granted so advocates could further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dunja Mijatovi\u0107 , the commissioner for the Council of Europe appealed to Patel .\n\u201c It is my view that the indictment by the United States against Mr. Assange raises important questions about the protection of those that publish classified information in the public interest , including information that exposes human rights violations.\n\u201d \u201c The broad and vague nature of the allegations against Mr. Assange , and of the offenses listed in the indictment , are troubling as many of them concern activities at the core of investigative journalism in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Consequently , allowing Mr.Assange \u2019 s extradition on this basis would have a chilling effect on media freedom , and could ultimately hamper the press in performing its task as purveyor of information and public watchdog in democratic societies.\n\u201d All of the above overtures to Patel were apparently brushed aside .\nThere is no evidence that any complaints about the Assange case were ever considered by Patel .\nThe news of the decision did not even come from Patel herself .\nAn unnamed Home Office spokesperson provided remarks that were circulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Extradition Act 2003 , the secretary of state must sign an extradition order if there are no grounds to prohibit the order being made .\nExtradition requests are only sent to the home secretary once a judge decides it can proceed after considering various aspects of the case.\n\u201d \u201c On June 17 , following consideration by both the magistrates court and high court , the extradition of Mr. Julian Assange to the US was ordered .\nMr. Assange retains the normal 14-day right to appeal.\n\u201d \u201c In this case , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be oppressive , unjust , or an abuse of process to extradite Mr Assange , \u201d the unnamed spokesperson claimed .\n\u201c Nor have they found that extradition would be incompatible with his human rights , including his right to a fair trial and to freedom of expression.\n\u201d They further claimed in the US his health would be treated appropriately .\nBut this was not a fresh statement from a department willing to take public responsibility for approving the request .\nIt was a kind of vulgar paraphrasing of the legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defending or justifying the Home Office \u2019 s action .\nThe spokesperson faithfully parroted the \u201c assurances \u201d that were put forward in diplomatic notes to the UK Foreign Office by the US State Department , which intervened after the Crown Prosecution Service and the US government lost their case at the district court level on January 4 , 2021 .\nThe US State Department \u2019 s intervention played a critical role in saving the extradition request .\nThe High Court of Justice relied on the assurances when overturning the district court decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Patel and the UK government put the UK \u2019 s role as a client state of the US government ahead of challenging the case .\nThis is a role the UK has performed consistently and dutifully since supporting the invasion of Iraq in 2003 .\nThe US and UK agreed to an alarming and unprecedented extradition request that criminalizes someone for engaging in standard newsgathering activities not only because they share the US government \u2019 s disgust for Assange but also because UK officials value the US-UK partnership more than human rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expansion of the Official Secrets Laws in the UK while the US extradition request moved through the UK courts .\nAs Mohamed Elmaazi reported for The Dissenter , the proposed expansion would make it possible for the UK government to imprison \u201c leakers , recipients of leaks , and secondary publishers\u2013including journalists\u2014from the current maximum of two years to as high as 14 years in prison.\n\u201d The Home Office contended there was no longer much of a difference between \u201c espionage and the most serious unauthorized disclosures.\n\u201d The department regarded @ @ @ @ @

Home Office.Declassified UK \u2019 s chief investigator Matt Kennard reported that Patel was on the advisory council for a right-wing group linked to the CIA called the Henry Jackson Society , which has attacked Assange several times since 2010 .\nWithout any meaningful objections from within the UK government , if Assange is eventually put on a plane and brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along with the US

reported that the US Supreme Court will determine whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whistleblower lawsuit brought under the False Claims Act when the government has declined to intervene in the case .\nIn other words , the Supreme Court could help corporations shut down independent whistleblower lawsuits that the Justice Department does not want to pursue .\nHealth care and pharmaceutical corporations , along with their lobbying networks , have ramped up pressure in recent years to stifle the effectiveness of the False Claims Act in holding their industry accountable and prevent the law \u2019 s expansion .\nUnder President Donald Trump , the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government recoveries under the law hit a \u201c ten-year low.\n\u201d Nearly $ 2.9 billion was recovered , but only $ 767 million of that money was a result of lawsuits by the government .\nWhistleblower lawsuits , however , yielded over $ 2.1 billion .\nA network of dark money has transformed the Supreme Court into an illegitimate and partisan institution .\nThe same court that overturned Roe v.

US Civil War .\nIt became known as the \u201c Lincoln law.\n\u201d According to Tom Mueller , author of Crisis of Conscience : Whistleblowing In An Age of Fraud , the law was intended to \u201c stop army and navy contractors from stealing taxpayer dollars but also to push complacent or complicit government agencies to act.\n\u201d The US did not have a Justice Department , Mueller noted .\nWhat the \u201c Lincoln law \u201d did was empower individuals to \u201c prosecute fraud with or without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be fined $ 2,000 for each misrepresentation or false claims they made when requesting payment from the government .\nThe law was gutted by Congress in 1943 because the Justice Department claimed it did not need the assistance of whistleblowers when prosecutors already knew about the fraud .\nAs Republican Senator Chuck Grassley recalled , this led to \u201c absurd results that only hurt the taxpayer.\n\u201d Grassley , an advocate for the law , said it \u201c basically meant that all whistleblower cases were blocked , even cases where the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whistleblower.\n\u201d In 1986 , Grassley helped to ensure that amendments to the False Claims Act were passed to restore power to private citizens to bring whistleblower lawsuits .\nIt ensured that whistleblowers would receive a reward in return for risking their career or legal jeopardy .\nHowever , in order to convince President Ronald Reagan to sign the amendments into law , Grassley and other senators had to overcome institutional opposition within the Justice Department .\nJay Stephens and Stuart Schiffer , two senior DOJ officials , opposed restoring the False @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department was doing a good enough job against defense contractor fraud and a stronger law would hamper their work , according to Mueller .\n\u201c The law , \u201d Stephens said , \u201c was an anachronism from a time when the United States had no central investigative force ; now that the DOJ

and complicit Justice Department from entering into \u201c sweetheart deals with powerful contractors.\n\u201d Justice Department officials remained opposed , even though Reagan declined to veto the amendments .\nIn 1989 , they argued to the US Supreme Court that the law was unconstitutional .\nBill Barr , who later became attorney general under Trump , was the assistant attorney general .\nHe contended the False Claims Act represented a \u201c devastating threat to the executive \u2019 s constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of powers.\n\u201d He objected to how Congress empowered citizens to help stimulate government action against fraud .\n\u201c There has been a massive upsurge in qui tam actions\u2014over 150 suits have been filed , \u201d Barr cried .\n\u201c These actions have disrupted the civil and criminal enforcement activities of the Department.\n\u201d \u201c They have also undermined the executive \u2019 s ability to administer complex procurement contracts and , in some cases , have caused serious national security concerns .\nThe 1986 Amendments have also spawned the formation of full-time \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go about prosecuting civil fraud actions in the name of the

of the cases were brought by the National HealthCare Analysis Group , which alleged \u201c violations of anti-kickback laws that prohibit improper marketing of drugs to medical professionals.\n\u201d They were viewed as a \u201c bounty hunting \u201d group .\nThe National Whistleblower Center called attention to the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case against the pharmaceutical corporation known as Gilead Sciences .\nA whistleblower accused the corporation of \u201c manufacturing drugs with contaminated ingredients from China \u201d and unusually the Justice Department maintained it would be too costly to pursue the lawsuit .\nGrassley and a bipartisan group of senators tried in 2021 to correct the issue of dismissals by the Justice Department by creating a test .\nProsecutors would be required to \u201c identify a valid government purpose and a rational relation between dismissal and accomplishment of that purpose.\n\u201d A whistleblower would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissal by \u201c demonstrating that the dismissal is fraudulent , arbitrary and capricious , or illegal.\n\u201d But Big Pharma succeeded in blocking the amendments from inclusion in the 2021 infrastructure bill that passed .\nIt was a major loss for whistleblowers .\n\u201c By raising false flags about these amendments and locking progress through complex and endless court cases , \u201d the National Whistleblower Center warned , an \u201c anti-whistleblower victory\u2014which could open the floodgates for future attacks on these highly successful whistleblower protections \u201d \u2014was secured by lobbyists .\nRecord Settlements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the past five years , lawsuits against the False Claims Act that are backed by corporate interests have sought to amplify uncertainty around the Supreme Court and lower courts \u2019 interpretation of provisions in the law .\nEach million spent on these efforts is intended to stall the progress of whistleblowers courageous enough to take a stand against corporate influence and power .\nGlaxoSmithKline , a major pharmaceutical corporation , was hit with a record $ 3 billion fine in 2012 after marketing their drugs for \u201c unauthorized uses \u201d and cheating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe result was a whistleblower reward of $ 250 million , which four individuals split .\nFaced with \u201c allegations it sold toxic mortgage-backed securities and other financial products \u201d in the run-up to the 2008 economic crash , Bank of America agreed to a record settlement with the US government of $ 16.65 billion in 2014 .\nThree whistleblowers and one firm shared a $ 170 million reward .\nPharmaceutical corporation Johnson & Johnson entered into a $ 2.2 billion settlement with the US government in 2012 to end a lawsuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schemes perpetrated to sell three drugs : Risperdal , Natrecor , and Invega .\nA whistleblower received a $ 167 million reward .\nThese are just three examples of how private individuals with evidence and knowledge of fraud can pursue a modest level of accountability against corporations , whether Justice Department officials have the political appetite for such action or not .\nThe Justice Department \u2019 s history of opposition to the False Claims Act does not exactly inspire confidence that the corporate-captured Supreme Court will leave the law alone .\nIf the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upends a settled law , their ruling may greatly diminish a tool that whistleblowers have wielded for decades .", "author": "Kevin Gosztola", "url":

Furman in the Southern District of New York did not schedule a sentencing date because there are other charges pending against Schulte .\nKnown as the \u201c Vault 7 \u201d materials , WikiLeaks began releasing documents on March 7 , 2017 .\nThey came from what WikiLeaks described as an \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIA \u2019 s Center for Cyber Intelligence.\n\u201d Documents revealed how the CIA could target iPhones , Androids , and Samsung TVs and convert the devices \u2019 microphones into bugs used to spy on targeted persons .\nMalware was also developed to infect Microsoft Windows users , and the CIA was \u201c hoarding \u201d security vulnerabilities in software and hardware that they could use for their covert operations instead of notifying companies that users were at risk of being hacked .\nIt was one of the largest leaks of information in the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo , who responded by labeling WikiLeaks a \u201c non-state hostile intelligence agency \u201d and developing \u201c secret war plans \u201d against the media organization that included kidnapping or even killing WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange .\nThe US government has charged Assange with violating the Espionage Act , and the UK government authorized his extradition in June .\nAssistant US Attorney Michael D. Lockard asserted that on April 20 , 2016 , Schulte \u201c stole the entirety of the CIA \u2019 s highly sensitive cyber intelligence capabilities.\n\u201d This occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defendant out of the secure restricted vault-like location on the network.\n\u201d \u201c Shortly after stealing this extraordinarily sensitive intelligence information , the defendant transmitted those backups to WikiLeaks , knowing full well that WikiLeaks would put it up on the internet , \u201d Lockard argued .\n\u201c In the weeks following this break-in , the defendant took every step he would need to take in order to transmit those files to WikiLeaks .\nHe downloaded a program that WikiLeaks itself recommends to leakers to use to send stolen data.\n\u201d The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a widely used privacy tool that was supported through funds from the US State Department .\nHe also downloaded Tails , which can be used to make a computer forget websites , files , passwords , and devices and Wi-Fi networks .\nLockard said , \u201c [ WikiLeaks ] tell [ s ] you to use Tails as an operating system that allows you to hide all of your activity.\n\u201d But like Tor , Tails can be used by anyone who cares about their privacy in an age of digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgruntled employee and insisted he was known at the CIA for filing \u201c false complaints , \u201d bragging about his access to the classified computer network , and defying his supervisors .\n\u201c The defendant would like to think of himself as a bad ass , but in fact , he is a ticking time bomb , a nuclear bomb , one that was ready to explode at any perceived provocation or disrespect , \u201d Lockard declared .\n\u201c And in April and May of 2016 , the defendant , the so-called nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the CIA \u2019 s cyber program , to prove his superiority , and to punish the people who he believed had wronged him .\nIn carrying out that revenge , he caused enormous damage to this country \u2019 s national security.\n\u201d But US prosecutors never presented any forensic evidence to specifically tie Schulte to the publication of the CIA hacking materials on WikiLeaks .\nSchulte acted very confident during his closing argument .\nHe insisted that Lockard was \u201c worried about the lack of evidence \u201d because he had told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not evidence of innocence.\n\u201d \u201c He \u2019 s worried there was no forensic artifact of a log-in to the Confluence server [ the server that allowed employees to share information ] , \u201d Schulte stated .\n\u201c He \u2019 s worried there was no forensic artifact of a copy command .\nAnd he \u2019 s worried there was no forensic artifact of the transmission to WikiLeaks .\nAnd finally , he \u2019 s worried there was no forensic artifact of any communication at all between me and WikiLeaks .\nHe should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 \u201d As Schulte put it , the CIA \u201c had no idea that its crown jewels \u201d were stolen until the material appeared on WikiLeaks .\n\u201c The CIA was under pressure\u2014I will say tremendous pressure\u2014to find out what was leaked , how it was leaked , and who leaked it .\nThey wanted to hold someone responsible for the leak , and so they began immediately an investigation , an investigation that focused on me.\n\u201d Schulte left the CIA on \u201c bad terms \u201d in November 2016 .\nAccording to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted that they had not even interviewed a single CIA witness .\nThey had not even finished seizing the DevLAN network [ which stored all the source code for hacking tools ] , let alone actually reviewed it .\nThey had not conducted any investigation at all , and yet I was already the target of their investigation.\n\u201d \u201c Then , within a week , the FBI concocted an impossible theory that the WikiLeaks crime occurred on March 7 , 2016 , because it was precisely a year before the leaks .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were at a manager offsite , and I was left alone in the office with no one to see what I was doing .\nAnd so the FBI argued I must have stolen the CIA \u2019 s files , \u201d Schulte added .\nFrank Stedman , who worked with Schulte , described why he was known as the \u201c nuclear option.\n\u201d It had nothing to do with someone prone to leaking classified information .\nHe said Schulte did not care about the process for raising complaints .\nHe would not play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , a project or something that we didn \u2019 t want to do or we thought was a bad idea , the joke was that we could bring him into the meeting and he would tell the customer to their face that they were stupid , that their idea was stupid , that we weren \u2019 t going to do it , \u201d Stedman testified .\nIt came out in testimony during both trials that at one point Schulte expressed views against leaking and suggested that NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prosecutors attempted to stop Schulte from insisting that there was information from the \u201c Vault 7 \u201d materials , which was already publicly available .\nSo the government had not taken steps to protect it , and he could not be guilty of violating the Espionage Act .\nJudge Furman allowed the argument .\nThere was scant coverage of both trials from the US news media .\nMatthew Russell Lee , who publishes to an independent site called Inner City Press , covered the trials\u2014and all hearings in between .\nSchulte was designated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by Attorney General Jeff Sessions , and Lee successfully won the unsealing of records related to Schulte \u2019 s civil complaint against the US government for cruel and inhuman treatment in Metropolitan Correctional Center New York .\n( The prison shut down as a result of deteriorating conditions in August 2021 . )\nAttorney General Merrick Garland has continued to impose the restrictive conditions against Schulte , which prohibit any communications with journalists , require an FBI agent to monitor limited communications with immediate family , and ban him from talking with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , Schulte complained , \u201c SAMs inmates are locked in concrete boxes the size of

increased funding of counter-extremism , supposedly in this case to prevent white supremacist violence , represents a double-edged sword for communities of color who are most often the target of these programs .\nCounter-extremism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the one in Buffalo .\nLos Angeles , for example , approved a $ 250,000 grant to the city \u2019 s police earlier this year , provided by the Department of Homeland Security \u2019 s Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention program .\nThe grant will help fund the Providing Alternatives to Hinder Extremism ( PATHE ) program , an intervention-based program claiming to help the Los Angeles Police Department ( LAPD ) identify individuals on pathways to extremism .\nPATHE is touted by media and police as an efficatious way to combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stop LAPD Spying Coalition ( SLAPD ) , a community-driven abolitionist organization , condemns it as a \u201c vehicle for LAPD to racially profile youth of color with pseudoscientific \u2018 risk assessments.\n\u2019 \u201d In Los Angeles , SLAPD , alongside organizations like Vigilant Love , the Palestinian Youth Movement , and others , have led the charge against the LAPD \u2019 s counter-extremism programming for years .\nSLAPD told Shadowproof by email that , in 2018 , organizers blocked a $ 425,000 grant to expand the city \u2019 s precursor to PATHE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c ignored the wishes of Angelenos \u201d three years later , SLAPD said , \u201c in order to prioritize the budget of the LAPD over the well-being of our youth.\n\u201d PATHE \u2019 s expansion eventually came to fruition in 2021 on the tail end of another betrayal , this time on the national level .\nIn June of that year , President Joe Biden not only abandoned campaign promises to end the Trump administration \u2019 s Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention program ( TVTP ) \u2014a resurrection of the Obama-era Countering Violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TVTP with the new Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships ( CP3 ) .\nToday , TVTP lives on as a grant program managed by CP3 and is described as the \u201c only federal grant program dedicated to enhancing the capabilities of local communities to prevent targeted violence and terrorism.\n\u201d CP3 distributed $ 20 million in grants nationwide through TVTP in 2021 , including the $ 250,000 grant for PATHE in Los Angeles .\nOrganizers like those working with SLAPD are urging abolitionists nationwide to explicitly take up and confront the ever-expanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular consciousness following the protest summer of 2020 .\nHowever , media coverage often hyper-focuses on police killings , failing to make important connections as the U.S. pours millions into dangerous counter-extremism programming .\n\u201c Surveillance isn \u2019 t harmful merely because it \u2019 s used by police , \u201d SLAPD wrote .\n\u201c Intent to harm is an essential part of surveillance and [ it ] precedes the creation of the police as a distinct institution in North America.\n\u201d In the U.S. , surveillance has taken different forms at different times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identification with slave passes to lantern laws demanding Black , mixed-race , and Indigenous people carry lanterns after sunset if not accompanied by a white person .\nNo matter how it presents itself , though , surveillance is fundamentally \u201c real-time social control \u201d facilitated by a number of organizations .\nThrough counter-extremism , the U.S. government uses debunked \u201c radicalization \u201d theories to target Muslims \u2014 and often Black Muslim youth \u2014 and communities of color with increased policing and surveillance .\nExported by the United Kingdom \u2019 s Prevent , counter-extremism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is an identifiable pathway to \u201c extremism \u201d requiring early intervention through not only watching communities but selectively funding non-profit programming , universities , and more .\nSLAPD writes that the federal government uses counter-extremism to \u201c export policing and surveillance to social workers , teachers , clergy , community members , and nonprofits.\n\u201d For example , TVTP does not limit its funding to law enforcement alone .\nVigilant Love \u2019 s # ServicesNotSurveillance campaign highlights counter-extremism \u2019 s encroachment into \u201c therapy , social work , school counseling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been targeted as well : in 2021 , DHS provided $ 750,000 to the University of Texas at El Paso and $ 400,000 to Music in Common \u2019 s Black Legacy Project .\nSurveillance is not necessarily about restricting only the actions and movements of targeted communities , but their thoughts , too .\nWhile counter-extremism programs like PATHE masquerade as supportive interventions into communities , SLAPD warned \u201c they greatly expand the power of the police state , which is the primary agent of white supremacy and violence in our lives.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called War on Terror , counter-extremism programming is part of a \u201c global surveillance infrastructure , \u201d Darakashan Raja , the founding director of Muslims for Just Futures , told Shadowproof by email .\nThat infrastructure \u201c create [ s ] a global confinement zone where individuals can \u2019 t truly be free anywhere they go if they are flagged as a terrorist or potential terrorist.\n\u201d DHS claims CP3 will combat \u201c domestic violence extremism , including violent white supremacy.\n\u201d CP3 \u2019 s formation came alongside the development of a Domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Analysis .\nWhile the government targeting white supremacy may seem like a positive development , it raises serious questions about the framing of the problem .\nIf the focus is on \u201c violent \u201d white supremacy , for example , what is non-violent or non-extremism white supremacy , and what is being done about it ?\nThere are significant reasons to doubt that a \u201c domestic terrorism \u201d framework can confront the problem of white supremacy .\nAs Nicole Nguyen and Yazan Zahzah noted in a recent report and toolkit , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence while failing to respond to structural inequalities that harm communities of color actively contributes to the reproduction of white supremacy.\n\u201d To put it another way , counter-extremism \u2019 s frameworks reduction of white supremacy to the deeds of a few individual bad actors allows the federal goverment to ignore that \u201c the DHS and the FBI [ \u2026 ] have always been intrinsically white supremacist institutions , from the histories of COINTELPRO to the War on Terror , \u201d SLAPD wrote .\n\u201d In addition , \u201d Raja warned , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s counterterrorism and national security infrastructure has always been weaponized against Black , Brown , Indigenous communities , and liberatory movements.\n\u201d That much is easily found within the Biden administration \u2019 s guidelines for combating \u201c domestic violent extremism \u201d released after the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection .\nWhile the guidelines never mention white supremacy explicitly , \u201c advocating for the superiority of the white race \u201d is listed under the Racially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists category .\nIt \u2019 s reminiscent of the FBI \u2019 s adoption of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 , which SLAPD argues \u201c paves the way for the administration to equate protesters rising up against the police with Neo-Nazis.\n\u201d Demanding the abolition of counter-extremism strategies seems like a daunting task especially as the federal government continues to muddy the program \u2019 s lineages by restructuring it , and as events like mass shootings create demand for further investment in them .\nOrganizers are making it easier for people to hop onboard with an abolitionist approach , though .\nLast year , Raja led the development of the Muslim Abolitionist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abolition of the War on Terror and demanding investments in care infrastructure instead .\nThe project collected oral histories from community organizers , activists , and others , \u201c who led , organized , and participated in social movements to resist the War on Terror.\n\u201d \u201c The agenda brought together Muslim-led abolitionist groups in order to build a collective agenda so that we could use it as a movement and advocacy tool , \u201d Raja explained .\n\u201c It \u2019 s easy to dismiss one person or one organization , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people power and the endorsement of multiple groups , it \u2019 s harder to ignore us.\n\u201d For both Raja and SLAPD , rejecting the false promises of reform is central to their work as abolitionists .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t measure out victories in reformist wins , which often sacrifice communities for the sake of expediency , \u201d SLAPD wrote .\n\u201c Rather , our goal is to build community power and popular knowledge and build a culture of resistance.\n\u201d This can look like working directly with community members who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than prioritizing the perspectives of academics , attorneys , and other professionals , who lack those ties to the community .\nWhen it comes to policing , surveillance is sometimes presented as a reform option and is not recognized as harmful and integral to the architecture of policing .\nAs Raja wrote , \u201c One of the biggest trends I have seen within criminal justice reform movements is the push for alternatives to incarceration that places people under state surveillance through parole and probation.\n\u201d The Community Justice Exchange , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ICE \u2019 s Intensive Supervision Appearance Program ( one of its Alternatives to Detention programs ) than are detained in immigration facilities .\n\u201c Not A Moment In Time But A Continuation Of History.\n\u201d An analysis of the development of counter-extremism programming in the U.S. illuminates the importance of more complex confrontations with policing .\nWhile it is certainly necessary to highlight the $ 100 billion cities collectively pour into policing each year in general , CP3 distributed $ 20 million in grants last year alone .\nIts predecessor , CVE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2017 .\nNeither of those numbers account for the funding required to run and house these programs .\nEven if police are abolished , the constant evolution of counter-extremism programs shows that , without a direct abolitionist confrontation , surveillance will find a way to survive .\nThe billions of funding currently directed to law enforcement institutions will likely find itself funneled into counter-extremism programs at city , state , and federal levels .\nConfronting surveillance , Raja wrote , \u201c allows for us to take a transnational approach to abolition.\n\u201d While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vein of surveillance as a whole , it is perhaps among the least understood .\nBut it is a perfect representation of SLAPD \u2019 s motto : \u201c Not a moment in time but a continuation of history.\n\u201d The motto not only frames SLAPD \u2019 s work as part of a longer struggle but helps to \u201c desensationalize the latest outrageous surveillance technology and ground abolition in decolonization.\n\u201d \u201c Understanding our fight as part of a global anti-imperialist struggle has led to our collaboration with orgs like Anakbayan LA and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c The struggle for abolition is one with the struggle against the US war machine .\n\u201d", "author": "Vanessa Taylor", "url": "https://shadowproof.com/2022/07/25/abolitionist-organizers-warn-counter-extremism-wont-stop-white-supremacist-violence/",

Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States raided the offices and homes of members of the African People \u2019 s Socialist Party ( APSP ) and the International People \u2019 s Democratic Uhuru Movement .\nAt 5 am in the morning on July 29 , FBI agents in St. Louis , Missouri , targeted the Uhuru Solidarity Center and the homes of 80 year-old APSP founder Omali Yeshitela and the African People \u2019 s Solidarity Committee chair Penny Hess .\nFBI agents simultaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group \u2019 s radio station Black Power 96.3 LFM in St. Petersburg , Florida .\nFBI agents told Yeshitela , the founder of the APSP , that they raided his home in north St. Louis because they had indicted a Russian national named Aleksandr Ionov .\nIonov is a Moscow resident who the U.S. Justice Department claims engaged in a campaign to \u201c influence \u201d U.S. political groups and \u201c interfere \u201d in US elections .\nHe founded a group called the Anti-Globalization Movement of Russia that hosted international solidarity conferences , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ionov was charged with a crime nor were they issued a grand jury subpoena .\nMembers of the Uhuru Movement and various leaders of other solidarity groups condemned the FBI raids as a continuation of the history of attacks on Black activists , like Fred Hampton , Mark Clark , and Marcus Garvey , as part of COINTELPRO under FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover .\nUhuru is the Swahili word for freedom or independence , and the Uhuru Movement was founded 50 years ago to complete the Black revolution of the 1960s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global struggle against white colonialism in the US that goes back centuries .\nThey engage in campaigns for reparations for slavery and education and community development in areas impacted by structural racism .\nAs Yeshitela recalled , he was in his home with his wife and organizer Ona Yeshitela , when FBI agents alerted them to their presence with a loudspeaker .\nThey were instructed to come out of their home with their hands up and nothing in their hands .\nWhile talking through the loudspeaker , FBI agents set off flash-bang grenades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window to the basement .\nOmari led the way down the stairs with his wife following him , and as Ona shared , \u201c This big ol \u2019 drone met me coming down the stairs , like it \u2019 s going to attack me.\n\u201d \u201c When I get outside , what I

occupying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors next door .\nAnd this is a really poor and economically depressed community what we live in , \u201d Omari said .\nFBI agents handcuffed and detained Omari and Ona .\nBoth were instructed to sit on a curb , but they refused .\nOmari was then told that they apparently had a search warrant related to the indictment of a Russian national and somehow his name and

their devices , computers , and other electronics in their home .\nThey also put tape over a doorbell security camera so his neighbors would not have footage of the raid .\nFBI agents used a battering ram to bust down the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movement \u2019 s office in St. Petersburg , and Omari claimed a 40-year archive on the movement was seized by agents .\nA report from the Associated Press indicated , \u201c Akile Anai , who describes herself as director of agitation and propaganda for the African People \u2019 s Socialist Party , said agents searched her car and took her cellphone and laptop computer on Friday in addition to raiding the Uhuru House.\n\u201d The African People \u2019 s Solidarity Committee operates out of the solidarity center in south St. Louis .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uhuru Movement that goes \u201c behind enemy lines \u201d to enlist support for black liberation in white communities .\nThey have organized for decades .\n\u201c [ The FBI ] took a battering ram

Committee .\nJesse Nevelsky is the white national chair of the Uhuru Movement , and he lives with his partner in the apartment above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and county police helped the FBI conduct the raid .\nThe FBI put Nevelsky and his partner , who also works for the organization , in handcuffs and moved them out of the building while six or seven FBI agents pointed assault rifles at them .\n\u201c Then they took five and a half to six hours to ransack both the solidarity center and the apartment upstairs and took computers , cellphones , hard drives , files , notebooks , and a whole long list of things , \u201d Nevelsky shared .\nOn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raided the homes of 23 antiwar , labor , and international solidarity activists in Chicago , Minneapolis , and other parts of the Midwest .\nThey

.\nLike the raids against the Uhuru Movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photos , membership lists for antiwar groups , and other political documents .\nThe activists formed the Committee to Stop FBI Repression , and along with the National Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression in Chicago , they put out a statement condemning the latest FBI raids .\n\u201c We oppose all efforts by the U.S. government to target activists in any progressive movement in this country .\nWe call for an end to investigations , political harassment , and threats against activists and our movements , \u201d the

the right to freely associate with people around the world , to hold any political beliefs it may choose , and to express them without fear of intimidation , persecution , or prosecution , \u201d BAP proclaimed .\nAPSP founder Omari Yeshitela attended a conference hosted by Aleksandr Ionov \u2019 s organization on September 20 , 2015 , that was called \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Self-Determination and the Construction of a Multipolar World.\n\u201d Yeshitela and other Uhuru Movement members are labeled as \u201c unindicted co-conspirators \u201d in the indictment against Ionov .\nParticularly , it accuses Yeshitela of entering into a partnership with Ionov while knowing he was an agent of the Russian government .\nOne of the other \u201c unindicted co-conspirators \u201d in the indictment is Louis J. Marinelli , who was the founder of CalExit , a right-wing campaign in the style of Brexit that called for California to secede from the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was previously linked to the Russian government in US news media reports , but the FBI did not raid Marinelli \u2019 s home or the homes of any individuals linked to the secession campaign .\nThe indictment maintains that Ionov worked with FSB or Russian intelligence officers to \u201c use members of U.S. political groups as foreign agents of Russia within the United States.\n\u201d He allegedly \u201c recruited members of various political groups within the United States and other countries , including Ukraine , Spain , the United Kingdom , and Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The purpose of the conferences was to encourage the participating groups to advocate for separating from their home countries , \u201d the indictment further contends .\n\u201c At these conferences , Ionov entered into partnership with some of the U.S. separatist groups , including groups from Florida and California.\n\u201d \u201c Thereafter , Ionov exercised direction or control over these groups on behalf of the FSB .\nIonov also monitored and

Skullduggery \u201d podcast from Yahoo !\nNews , McCord contended that provisions in the World War 1-era law , which has been applied to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Trump allegedly did\u2014 \u201d removing documents from their proper place , \u201d losing or stealing information , and other acts of \u201c gross negligence.\n\u201d But the Espionage Act is part of the two-tiered US justice system .\nOnly lower-level federal government employees or contractors are punished with Espionage Act charges .\nHigh-ranking officials are able to use their status to avoid charges that would turn them into convicted felons .\nIt is , however , possible that the FBI invoked provisions of the Espionage Act to secure a warrant to search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of classified documents .\nA grand jury subpoena for \u201c sensitive documents \u201d was issued to Trump in the spring , according to NBC News .\nThe subpoena related to documents that Trump \u2019 s legal team discussed with Justice Department officials around that same time .\nThe National Archives and Records Administration ( NARA ) coordinated with Trump representatives in 2021 , and in January 2022 , 15 boxes were transferred to the National Archives .\nSome of the records contained classified information so NARA contacted the Justice Department [ PDF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Mar-a-Lago home on August 8 , and they reportedly retrieved at least 10 boxes of documents .\nSome of those files allegedly contain classified information .\nThe fact that those boxes were not turned over when Trump representatives coordinated with NARA likely factored into the FBI \u2019 s decision to deploy agents to reclaim the documents .\nThe Justice Department routinely investigates and prosecutes US government employees and contractors who take classified information and try to keep the records in their home .\nSuch individuals are typically charged with \u201c unauthorized possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of \u201c national defense information.\n\u201d On May 18 , 2021 , Kendra Kingsbury , a 48 year-old FBI intelligence analyst who had a top secret security clearance , was charged [ PDF ] with willfully retaining national defense information in violation of the Espionage Act .\nBetween June 2004 and December 2017 , she allegedly took documents on FBI counterterrorism operations as well as CIA documents on al Qaida in

an office that worked with industry partners .\nOn March 29 , 2022 , he was accused of willfully retaining national defense information and violating the Espionage Act in his personal email account .\nAs an NSA employee , Unkenholz did not have physical copies of the records in his home .\nHe possessed the files by having the documents in his personal email , and the FBI learned of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person at a company who was not authorized to receive the information .\n( Note : Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had classified information on her private email server that created an \u201c increased risk of unauthorized disclosure.\n\u201d ) Then there is the case of the \u201c collector of rare documents.\n\u201d In 2012 , Secrecy News reported that James Hitselberger , a Navy

a Hitselberger collection that contained \u201c political posters and leaflets that he gathered in pre-revolutionary Iran.\n\u201d FBI agents uncovered classified documents in Hitselberger \u2019 s

later shared the Black Books with Paula Broadwell , who he had an affair with while she was writing a biography , All In : The Education of General David Petraeus .\nBecause Petraeus was a former

, who worked for Der Spiegel when the German media organization first partnered with WikiLeaks to publish documents on the Afghanistan and Iraq wars .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Kingdom Home Secretary Priti Patel approved the US extradition request against Assange .\nHis legal team has submitted two separate appeals in the UK courts , yet it is increasingly evident that Assange could be flown to the US to face Espionage Act charges that civil liberties , human rights , and press freedom organizations around the world have condemned .\nAccording to the complaint [ PDF ] filed in a US court in the Southern District of New York , Glass , Goetz , Hrbek , and Kunstler , like all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d their electronic devices to UC Global employees hired by Ecuador to provide security for the

there to represent Assange , journalists who traveled to interview him , and even doctors who came to the embassy to assess and treat his deteriorating health .\nTheir privileged communications stored on electronic devices were compromised .\nThe CIA-backed spying operation began around January 2017 and lasted until UC Global \u2019 s contract was terminated around April 2018 .\nBy that time , the Justice Department under President Donald Trump already had a sealed indictment against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hidden microphones in new cameras at the embassy .\nHe allegedly approved bugging the embassy with hidden microphones .\nHe allegedly signed off on a plan to allow the CIA to \u201c observe and listen to Assange \u2019 s daily activities at the embassy.\n\u201d Also , the complaint claims Pompeo approved the copying of visitors \u2019 passports , \u201c including pages with stamps and visas.\n\u201d He ensured that all \u201c computers , laptops , mobile phones , recording devices ,

.\nMorales did not speak very good English , yet as further evidence that UC Global was working for the CIA , the complaint notes that UC Global employees were given \u201c written technology instructions \u201d for live streaming and audio associated with the surveillance \u201d that were in \u201c perfect English.\n\u201d There was an \u201c external streaming access point \u201d for

would be working for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c the Americans \u201d would help UC Global secure major contracts throughout the world .\nThe complaint says former UC Global employees believe the \u201c deal

security journalist William Arkin appeared on \u201c Democracy Now !\n\u201d and spoke out against liberals in the United States who believed the FBI ( and CIA ) could save the country from President Donald Trump .\n\u201c The FBI , in particular , has a deplorable record in American society , from Martin Luther King and the peace movements of the 1960s all the way up through Wen Ho Lee and others who have been persecuted by the FBI , \u201d Arkin stated .\n\u201c And there \u2019 s no real evidence that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin with in terms of even pursuing the prosecutions that it \u2019 s pursuing.\n\u201d \u201c But yet we lionize them .\nWe hold them up on a pedestal , that somehow they are the truth-tellers , that they \u2019 re the ones who are getting to the bottom of things , when there \u2019 s just no evidence that that \u2019 s the case , \u201d Arkin added .\nArkin has a proven record of speaking out against perpetual war and challenging the immense power of the national security state .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secret America : The Rise of the American Security State and also wrote the book American Coup , which he describes as documenting the \u201c creeping fascism of homeland security.\n\u201d When Arkin appeared on \u201c Democracy Now !\n\u201d , he had just left NBC News and circulated a letter that criticized the media organization for \u201c emulating \u201d the national security state in the era of Trump .\nI recount all of the above to show you why I setup an interview with Arkin about the Justice Department and FBI \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his possession of documents at Mar-a-Lago .\nHe has the credibility to offer important insights into what pursuing an Espionage Act prosecution against a former US president may mean for the United States .\nArkin is currently the senior editor for intelligence at Newsweek .\nHe has written multiple reports related to the Justice Department \u2019 s investigation into former President Donald Trump \u2019 s mishandling of classified information .\nHis reporting revealed that the FBI had an informant , who had knowledge of what documents Trump had in his possession and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported more details on Trump \u2019 s \u201c private stash \u201d of documents .\nIn the 30-minute interview , which was recorded on August 19 , Arkin outlines the timeline of events , what the DOJ investigation may mean for Trump \u2019 s potential 2024 presidential campaign , and why he believes the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago has sparked one of the biggest political disasters in the history of the bureau .\n*Below is a transcript of the interview with minor edits to improve clarity .\nWILLIAM ARKIN : It \u2019 s important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened at Mar-a-Lago because this has been going on since Trump left office .\nSo even though most people were not aware , there \u2019 s been a battle between the Trump camp and the National Archives since January 2021 about this whole question of what records the Trump administration had taken with them from the White House .\nIf you talk to Trump people , they \u2019 ll tell you , oh , we had such a rushed departure\u2014and of course the reason is because Donald Trump did not accept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took boxes to Mar-a-Lago .\nIndeed , in January of this year the Trump camp delivered 15 boxes of presidential records to the National Archives , and it was in the course of that delivery that I think the National Archives came to see that these were not complete sets of records , that there were a lot of presidential records which were still being held by the Trump camp , and they requested additional records .\nAnd basically this has been going on now since January 2022 this year and that culminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was delivered to the Trump camp in the end of May , and that subpoena basically said here are specific documents and types of documents that we would like you to return and the next step essentially was that three FBI agents and a Justice Department official visited Mar-a-Lago on June 3 , and they retrieved some documents .\nBut they also in the process of that inspected the storage room at Mar-a-Lago , where Trump was keeping his presidential materials and recognized that there were additional materials with additional classified information .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional materials .\nThey asked the Trump [ camp ] to put better locks on the door of the storage room .\nThey knew that they were there .\nSo when the search occurred on August 8 , it was a surprise to most people .\nMaybe not so much to the people who had been following this back and forth .\nBut it does raise the question as to whether or not what Merrick Garland , the attorney general says , is true , which is did they in fact exhaust all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNow we know that they took 27 boxes of documents from Mar-a-Lago last week .\nSo that \u2019 s a total of 42 boxes of documents , and the 27 boxes of documents that they took under this search warrant included 11 sets of classified documents and an additional leather box that they had retrieved that contained top secret sensitive compartmented information .\nI reported earlier last week that the FBI had a confidential human source inside the Trump camp that essentially let them on to the fact that Donald Trump was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point based upon my reporting , it looks like the FBI had two targets in their raid on Mar-a-Lago .\nOne was to retrieve the additional boxes that they knew were in the storage room , and two was to find this stash of documents that Donald Trump was evidently segregating from those 27 boxes , which the FBI concluded as part of their investigation that Donald Trump had no intention of returning .\nI wouldn \u2019 t say that the search at Mar-a-Lago was a cover for the fact that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Donald Trump himself has given us clues to the fact that there were two separate searches .\nBecause we know that the storage room was entered .\nWe know that they entered the bedroom in the presidential office .\nDonald Trump is the one who said that they broke into his personal safe .\nAnd in fact when the FBI returned Donald Trump \u2019 s passports earlier this week , it was evident that they had gotten them from somewhere that wasn \u2019 t the storage room .\nIt pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal safe had been broken into .\nIt \u2019 s kind of a game of chicken between the FBI and the Trump camp .\nRight , Donald Trump can \u2019 t say , oh , I was secreting away particular documents , and that \u2019 s what the FBI is really going after .\nHe \u2019 s just going to go on this straight I \u2019 ve-been-politically-persecuted line , and that \u2019 s what he \u2019 s going to stick with .\nAnd of course once the Trump camp gets their act together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually going to say , the reality is they \u2019 re probably going to argue , why did [ the FBI ] execute the search warrant at all because we were cooperating with the National Archives ?\nAnd if they had asked us for additional boxes , we would have returned them .\nSo , yes , it \u2019 s true that Trump has kind of argued they were my private papers .\nThey weren \u2019 t belonging to the National Archives .\nBut it \u2019 s sort of irrelevant because if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the FBI really going after , you wouldn \u2019 t understand why they would have thought it necessary to execute this extraordinary and unprecedented of a personal residence of a former president , which has never been done in our history .\nIf you understand that the FBI obviously felt that Donald Trump was not planning to return everything , that they knew from their confidential human source and their investigation that it existed ( and more or less where it existed ) , and that they were concerned that Donald Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be using it for monetary gain or using it as part of his election efforts .\nWe don \u2019 t really know the answer there .\nBut if you consider all of those , then the search begins to make some sense , even though I think politically it \u2019 s been a disaster for the FBI , and as much as the mainstream might be rallying around the FBI and saying , oh , poor FBI , the truth of the matter is that it seems like this is another naive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Justice Department that thinks that because we have all of the paperwork in order that it makes sense to execute this but I think in fact it \u2019 s probably strengthened Donald Trump \u2019 s hand within the Republican Party and also within the electorate , who feel like in fact after six years of investigations if they haven \u2019 t indicted him yet that it is persecution .\nAnd there \u2019 s some validity to that .\nLet \u2019 s just imagine for a moment that Bernie Sanders was president , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for six years .\nI mean people would be screaming bloody murder .\nEither indict him or stop it .\nAnd so I imagine in the coming weeks we are either going to see Donald Trump indicted finally for a peripheral question , which is possession of these documents .\nNot the content of the documents , but possession of them .\nOr we \u2019 re going to see a political disaster in the making , which is that everyone is going to rally behind Donald Trump within the Republican camp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of the Biden administration , even though I believe that it didn \u2019 t have political overtones to it or undertones to it .\nThat they inadvertently stepped into something like the Mueller investigation or like Comey talking about Hillary Clinton \u2019 s emails , where they just didn \u2019 t understand what the political fallout of their actions were going to be .\nKEVIN GOSZTOLA : What is your assessment of the divisions or factions or the nature of the FBI or Justice Department\u2014not necessarily just right now but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this moment\u2014and their relationship to Donald Trump ?\nBecause I think it \u2019 s so important for people to know the deeper context , and since you \u2019 ve done this reporting on administrations for so long , how extraordinary it was that they had such a different posture to the president than some of the more recent previous presidents in history .\nBecause this relationship is completely unlike Obama .\nIt \u2019 s completely unlike George W. Bush .\nIt \u2019 s completely unlike what we have with Joe Biden .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exist between those prior presidents .\nARKIN : Well , we \u2019 ve never had a Donald Trump before .\nThat \u2019 s the most important ingredient here .\nThe FBI has always been a political organization , though it would like to portray itself as not one .\nDuring the civil rights era or during the communist scare of the 1950s or doing the period of time where it was basically persecuting those who were against the war in Vietnam , etc , the FBI has always hewed in the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antagonism towards the left .\nWith Donald Trump , the shift began to be apparent that the FBI , in fact , had a lot of people within its ranks who were anti-Trump .\nIn fact , the long bipartisan era of the FBI was over .\nWe live in a topsy-turvy world where the Rachel Maddows of the world are cheering the FBI on and the right-wing hates them .\nThat \u2019 s unprecedented in modern history , that the left somehow thinks that the CIA and FBI are going to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right [ supporting these agencies ] .\nEven like the left is quasi-cheerleaders for perpetual war and for the continuation of the war in Syria and for the war in Ukraine , etc .\nWhereas the right is much more of a traditional American isolationist entity .\nLook , Donald Trump isn \u2019 t smart enough to articulate and/or represent the actual currents , which exist within American society , but there are currents that exist within American society .\nIt \u2019 s Washington DC , and the New York bubble and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , or urban versus rural .\nWhatever way you want to describe it .\nDonald Trump was elected because of that divide .\nBecause of that increasing divide between officialdom and the rest of the American population .\nSo the FBI , which has always been seen in the mainstream \u2019 s eyes as being a neutral party , became a very political party .\nThey just did .\nThey became a political party .\nAnd at the same time that Barack Obama was being criticized during the 2016 presidential election cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vis Russian collusion and Russian intervention\u2014Obama said , well , I \u2019 m not going to do more because I don \u2019 t want to put my finger on the scale of the election .\nIt \u2019 s up to the American people to decide who is the next president .\nBut they wanted the FBI to put their finger on the scale , and that was what happened when Comey had a press conference right prior to the election and stated Hillary [ Clinton ] broke the law but we \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That just pissed everybody off on both sides , but most importantly , what it did was introduce the idea that Hillary Clinton was a lawbreaker and hadn \u2019 t been held accountable whereas Donald Trump was being accused of being lawbreaker and people were assuming that he was guilty .\nI \u2019 m sorry .\nI live in a country where I still believe innocent until proven guilty .\nDonald Trump is innocent .\nHe \u2019 s innocent of claims of collusion .\nHe \u2019 s innocent of claims of cooperation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims until he is proven guilty .\nSo while we might be comfortable in the mainstream saying Donald Trump \u2019 s lies about the election\u2014I mean , listen to NPR .\nThey say it in that way , and it should be Donald Trump \u2019 s claims about the election .\nBy saying the word lies , you are already declaring what your political position is .\nThat \u2019 s not impartial journalism as I understand it to be .\nSo Donald Trump is innocent until proven guilty , and now this search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a citizen that either the Justice Department brings charges against Donald Trump or it starts to reevaluate whether it continues to spend its resources and our money in going after this guy .\nGOSZTOLA : Let me ask you a few specific questions .\nDo you actually believe that this is a mistake on Donald Trump \u2019 s part that he has these boxes ?\nI seem to get from the way you are setting up the timeline that that seems like a very convenient excuse at this hour .\nHave you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mistake with this many boxes of documents ?\nARKIN : I mean , Melania \u2019 s shoes might have taken 42 boxes themselves .\nWe don \u2019 t know how many boxes were actually removed from the White House in that six-hour period on January 20 .\nBut I think it \u2019 s important that you think because Donald Trump screwed up and didn \u2019 t have a normal transition and boxes ended up going to Mar-a-Lago that shouldn \u2019 t have gone to Mar-a-Lago , it doesn \u2019 t mean it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault .\nI mean , this is his trick , right ?\nThey were sent by mistake , but if it had been a normal transition , they wouldn \u2019 t have been sent by mistake .\nYou have to ultimately say that this falls on Donald Trump in terms of what direction was given to the White House staff and his subordinates in terms of preparing the White House for the Biden administration to come into the office .\nSo , yes , I can see that the documents might have ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mistake is that Donald Trump didn \u2019 t accept the results of the election and didn \u2019 t facilitate an ordinary transition .\nWhy it \u2019 s so important then to see the decision-making on the part of the FBI and the Justice Department about this extraordinary search is that it obviously has to be about something bigger than just run-of-the-mill secrets .\nAnd I know that some people will think , well wait a minute ?\nTop secret documents are documents that could cause exceptionally grave damage to the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this business a long time , and I also am a former intelligence officer in the US military , and I can tell you there \u2019 s a heckuva lot of top secret documents that have no meaning outside of just the source of information that is just describing what we know .\nA lot of this [ information ] is classified because of the possibility that its release would divulge intelligence sources and methods , and some of those intelligence sources and methods , such as our satellite capabilities , are well-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have this idea that somehow Donald Trump stole secrets , when I \u2019 m kind of doubtful that there was really much material that was in there that was intentional or detrimental to US national security in a specific way .\nHowever , we know that Donald Trump during his entire presidency took documents to his residence , asked for copies of documents , ripped pages out of documents that were delivered to him , squirreled away documents that were interesting to him , and those documents dealt with everything from Russiagate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear capabilities of Iran and North Korea and possibly even Russia and China .\nSo we know that it \u2019 s a wide variety of documents\u2014things that Donald Trump found interesting .\nThat \u2019 s basically this leather box or this separate stash of documents that were in his personal safe , and that was really the focus .\nI think in the end people will be surprised that it \u2019 s not really an argument about the sensitivity of the documents per se .\nIt \u2019 s just about the documents .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey don \u2019 t need to argue that the documents are highly classified or whatever .\nThat \u2019 s terminology that we use in the news media .\nAnd it \u2019 s kind of bullshit .\nIf Donald Trump just had a bunch of personal letters that belonged to the National Archives under the Presidential Records Act , they would still be making the same arguments as to why we need to retrieve those letters from the Trump camp .\nSo I think it was really only in the case of documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally segregated\u2014and might use in the future , that were the ones that they were concerned about .\nGOSZTOLA : That \u2019 s the problem , right ?\nWe get this from your reporting .\nIt does a good job of communicating this .\nIt doesn \u2019 t seem like the FBI is moved to conduct the search just because Donald Trump has [ these boxes ] .\nBecause we see the ongoing conversations with representatives over returning the boxes .\nBut there \u2019 s something about the stash .\nThere \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he \u2019 s going to do something with the documents that he has privately , and obviously , we \u2019 re at an important point in time .\nThere \u2019 s a Trump circus , but there \u2019 s also an election circus .\nWe are dominated from 2023 to November 2024 will be primaries and general electon , wall-to-wall media .\nAnd you know this better than anyone having survived alongside it\u2014how much elections dominate and overshadow important national security journalism and other stories that should be given attention rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s hard not to think based upon what you \u2019 ve been reporting that there is some motivation that , okay , we have a small window of time to do this before Donald Trump might start his campaign .\nAnd also these documents , as your sources told you , [ Trump ] is going to weaponize this information .\nSo I think it \u2019 s worth asking you what your assessment is of the Russiagate counter-investigation .\nThat is the investigation into the people who were investigating Donald Trump and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have committed by people who were empowered , like Durham , to investigate these people and what was happening .\nThere have been some things related to Carter Page , and there \u2019 s been some isolated examples .\n[ The Trump camp has ] tried to craft a narrative that people within these institutions were trying to , as they would put it , take down Donald Trump .\nThat \u2019 s how they present it to the American people .\nIf the FBI is going in there to take this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proven out that there are documents related to the Russia investigation that Donald Trump was keeping because he thought they exonerated him or whatever , that seems pretty bad as far as the FBI and the idea that it \u2019 s supposed to be a neutral institution .\nI mean , obviously , historically it \u2019 s always acted politically .\nBut if the FBI is going above and beyond to seem like it \u2019 s not a political organization , how do you green light a search when it is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taking this step ?\nARKIN : Let \u2019 s talk about it in the context of 2024 .\nFirst of all , we have to understand that what was been revealed as result of the 2016 election and Russiagate is that there was FBI wrongdoing .\nWhether you consider minor or not , the truth of the matter is that we \u2019 ve had FBI agents go to jail already for falsifying FISA applications , for using official email and text to campaign against Donald Trump as a candidate , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are supposed to be neutral parties essentially declaring that they are anti-Trump .\nI don \u2019 t take from that that it \u2019 s big or little .\nI don \u2019 t want to quibble about whether or not the FBI is or isn \u2019 t pro- anti-Trump , but what we see is they make mistakes .\nTons of them .\nThis is not a perfect institution .\nWe should stop seeing it as a perfect institution .\nIf you understand that this is a flawed institution , where the lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this , you can do that , and you can do this and you can do that , and now the FBI has to decide are we publicly going to be able to do this , that the reality in the end is the FBI seems to operate on the idea that if the paperwork is immaculate that the political consequences are going to be neutral .\nThat \u2019 s where the FBI has gotten it wrong over and over again .\nThe paperwork can be immaculate , and yet they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I \u2019 m a smart Justice Department official , I \u2019 m going to say we got to let the chips fall where they may .\nIf the raid on Mar-a-Lago helps Donald Trump , we still have to do what \u2019 s legally correct to do .\nNow you might ask , well , did they exhaust all the possibilities in talking to the Trump camp ?\nDid they absolutely have to do this ?\nWhat evidence did they have that Donald Trump was going to weaponize the information ?\nWas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do it now ?\nEtc etc .\nIn the end , if I \u2019 m a Justice Department official appearing before the news media , I might answer every question that I understand that you are arguing the political consequences , but our job is to enforce the law .\nAnd Donald Trump was breaking the law , and we needed to enforce the law and it took us this long to get to the place where it was obvious that Donald Trump was not going to return the material that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this is going to come out in the coming weeks or months , but whether or not it is going to benefit Donald Trump in this election cycle , and then specifically , in 2024 , we \u2019 ll have to see .\nI \u2019 m fearful that the effect of this is going to be that more people will lose respect for the government .\nMore people will see Washington as persecuting Donald Trump , and that the Biden administration and the Biden Justice Department are not going to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s going to add to the Trump camp \u2019 s constituency .\nWe already see that prominent Republicans from all walks of life except for two people on the planet ( Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger ) have all rallied behind Donald Trump on this issue .\nI would say that this is perhaps one of the largest crises in the FBI \u2019 s history .\nThey may not understand it themselves .\nThey may have made mistakes here in what they did , and they may have been legally justified to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe it will be seen as a disaster .\nGOSZTOLA : Finally I want to put to you the issue of the Espionage Act being part of the conversation .\nA lot of my work has been watching and monitoring and covering the developments in individual Espionage Act prosecutions over the last decade-plus .\nThose individuals and their attorneys would also say that they were charged for materials that would not cause exceptionally grave damage , and yet the book was thrown thrown at them and they had their lives ruined and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t the same be true for Donald Trump ?\nI think it presents a crisis .\nI think it \u2019 s part of this crisis of the liberals and the Democratic Party establishment really feeling strongly about pushing forward with whatever the Justice Department is about to do .\nWhat \u2019 s your sense of the risk if Donald Trump were to be charged with violating the Espionage Act ?\nYou \u2019 re talking to people about the potential charges that could be brought .\nIs this even a distinct possibility ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ be within that law .\nBut there are other laws .\nDo you think it would be a more minor law to keep the Espionage Act out of the conversation ?\nARKIN : We now know that the Espionage Act was only being referenced because of section 793 ( d ) of the Espionage Act , which is an area of the Espionage Act that deals with if you are in possession of classified documents and the federal government asks you to return them , and you don \u2019 t return them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( d ) of the Espionage Act .\nIt \u2019 s called the Espionage Act , what it \u2019 s been called since 1917 , but it also happens to be just one of a handful of laws that deal with security classification .\nThe rest of the security classification system exists under executive order .\nThat \u2019 s why Donald Trump and his people are arguing that he declassified everything .\nBut it \u2019 s not altogether true .\nSome elements of classified information do fall under statute , such as atomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of CIA sources , etc .\nThose fall under statute .\nSo it \u2019 s unfortunate that the Espionage Act is the place where this is contained , this provision about returning classified material in your possession , because it \u2019 s abused in a way because we don \u2019 t have modern legislation .\nPerhaps one of the solutions will be that we will finally have a law passed , which will specify what is classified and unclassified information and what is the modern security classification system and where are the authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what \u2019 s not against the law .\nThat does influence Julian Assange \u2019 s problems in the courts .\nIt influences other whistleblowers who have been charged with the Espionage Act , and even if they were not guilty of espionage , as we think of it , they are charged under the Espionage Act .\nSo we need to clean this up because I don \u2019 t think that we have a law in a proper way that really specifies what the true state of play is here .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donald Trump to spur along a better articulation of what is the actual purpose of the Espionage Act .\nTo have say for instance Julian Assange , a foreign national charged under the Espionage Act\u2014espionage against who ?\nIf he committed espionage against Australia , then he should be charged in his own country of his nationality .\nIn some ways , if I \u2019 m a supporter of Julian Assange , I want to see that Donald Trump helps to clarify what is this law and what it can really be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ Chelsea ] Manning , in the cases of Tom Drake , in the case of Julian Assange , I think it \u2019 s been misapplied .\nAnd in the case of journalism , there have been attempts at various times within our recent past going back to the Reagan administration , where the federal government has sought to use the Espionage Act as a way of suppressing a free press .\nAgain , if I \u2019 m really interested in the future , I would want to see Congress step in finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with security classification in this country .\nThat \u2019 s more important than Donald Trump .", "author": "Kevin Gosztola", "url":

Trials This article was funded by paid subscribers of The Dissenter Newsletter .\nBecome an annual paid subscriber to help us continue our independent journalism .\nA whistleblower protection bill containing access to jury trials , which has long been a priority for advocates , passed in the United States House of Representatives on September 15 .\nThe legislation , the Whistleblower Protection Improvement Act ( WPIA ) , was sponsored by Representative Carolyn Maloney , who is the chair of the House Committee on Oversight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their claims heard by a jury in a US district court if the Merits Systems Protection Board ( MSPB ) , an administrative body largely unknown to most Americans , does not rule on their case within 180 days ( or 240 days if the MSPB certifies that a case is \u201c complex \u201d ) .\nThe MSPB has a backlog of at least 3,000 cases as of June 2022 , according to the Federal News Network .\nIf this bill were to pass in the US Senate and be signed by President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major logjam that has blocked whistleblowers from obtaining a review of their claims .\nFurthermore , the bill grants \u201c any employee or applicant for employment adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order or decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board may obtain judicial review of the order or decision.\n\u201d Research by the Government Accountability Project ( GAP ) showed [ PDF ] in the first six months of 2021 that MSPB judges \u201c ruled against whistleblowers in fifty of the past fifty-one retaliation cases.\n\u201d \u201c Federal employees are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country who don \u2019 t have access to a jury trial to challenge retaliation against their free speech rights , \u201d GAP legal director Tom Devine declared .\n\u201c Instead of being able to seek justice from a jury of the citizens who they are reporting to defend when they risk their careers , their day in court is limited to administrative judges who rule against whistleblowers in 96 percent of cases and are extremely vulnerable to political pressure.\n\u201d Devine also said , \u201c It is ironic and indefensible that federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest stakes for our country , have the weakest due process rights to defend themselves.\n\u201d Significantly , the bill recognizes the impotency of the MSPB by making whistleblower access to a jury trial \u201c retroactive for claims filed to MSPB for up to five years prior to the date of enactment.\n\u201d This means whistleblower complaints from as early as the first year of Donald Trump \u2019 s presidency , which are still pending before the MSPB , could be submitted to a federal court .\nWhistleblower complaints in a US district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would fall under the Civil Rights Act ( 1964 ) , the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ( 1967 ) , or the Fair Labor Standards Act ( 1938 ) .\nCongress was urged in 2012 to include access to jury trials in the Whistleblower Protection Act ( WPA ) .\nThe Justice Department aggressively fought the provision .\nPresident Barack Obama ultimately caved .\nAccording to Devine , Jeff Sessions , who was a US senator and later became attorney general under Trump , also threatened to put a hold on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Staff for Senator Susan Collins suggested the bill may not pass at all if whistleblower advocates did not back down .\nStephen Kohn of the National Whistleblower Center previously stated , \u201c Federal employees need the same access to US courts as corporate employees , government contractors , truck drivers , food service workers , state and local government employees , Dodd-Frank Act whistleblowers , False Claims Act whistleblowers , whistleblowers who file state common law claims , and the vast majority of all other whistleblowers.\n\u201d Only two House Republicans voted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c whistleblowers already have more rights than they need , \u201d and the legislation would \u201c make it impossible to fire incompetents and wrongdoers.\n\u201d \u201c However , whistleblowers routinely wait three to five years to lose over 95 percent of decisions on the merits , \u201d GAP responded .\n\u201c Rather than creating an insurance policy , the legislation transforms fraudulent rights into genuine ones.\n\u201d The bill does not cover intelligence agency employees , contrary to what several Republicans suggested in their attacks on the bill .\nIt does not appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate , but Republican Senator Chuck Grassley , a longtime supporter of whistleblowers , previously introduced legislation that would establish basic protections for FBI whistleblowers .\nYet the expanded protection for FBI whistleblowers would not include access to a jury trial .", "author": "Kevin Gosztola",

of the kickback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lawsuit .\n\u201c In 2009 alone , Biogen paid 820 physicians a total of $ 8.8 million to speak or consult , $ 10,600 per physician .\nFaced with the market entry of the first oral treatment for MS , Gilenya , Biogen expanded these programs in 2010.\n\u201d In 2010 , Biogen paid $ 9.1 million to 1,200 physicians for \u201c speaking \u201d or \u201c consulting.\n\u201d The meetings were frequently redundant and trainings had an \u201c excessive number of unnecessary speakers.\n\u201d On September 2 , 2010 , while Bawduniak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he received a list of fifty doctors who were deemed \u201c at risk \u201d of adopting Gilenya .\nBawduniak recognized that having a list of \u201c completed and anticipated payments to major prescribers who the company had identified as priority accounts would constitute evidence of unlawful payments for the purpose of obtaining prescriptions.\n\u201d A senior executive in Biogen \u2019 s compliance department confirmed to Bawduniak that requesting information about the physicians would constitute evidence that the corporation was trying to influence a doctor to prescribe Biogen products .\nBawduniak informed two Biogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctors it would \u201c make it clear that Biogen was making payments for prescriptions.\n\u201d Still , one of the executives who had asked for the information pressed on with their requests and eventually obtained it from other sources .\nIn February 2011 , Bawduniak was demoted to \u201c thought leader liaison \u201d and no longer directly received reports on \u201c at risk \u201d doctors .\nThe press release further details the staggering fraud .\n\u201c Biogen inflated the amounts paid to most of its speakers and consultants by automatically adding three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even when Biogen knew the customers whom it paid did not have to travel or only traveled a minimal distance.\n\u201d \u201c And many of Biogen \u2019 s events were held at sumptuous resorts and restaurants , where Biogen treated its speakers and consultants to lavish meals and free alcohol.\n\u201d Twenty-five to thirty percent of the federal funds recovered through the settlement will be awarded to Bawduniak .\nMary Inman , an attorney and partner at the law firm Constantine Cannon who has represented whistleblowers in False Claims Act cases for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a \u201c testament to the strength \u201d of the FCA .\nIt is a \u201c really important release valve.\n\u201d \u201c Increasingly what we \u2019 re seeing is that the government just doesn \u2019 t have the resources to intervene in all these cases because there \u2019 s been such an increase in the number of cases and the quality of them , \u201d Inman added .\n\u201c So oftentimes they will decline to intervene when they have faith that the whistleblower and their counsel have the wherewithal to continue with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline to intervene or take up a case because of political reasons , such as if the fraud exposed makes prosecutors look bad for missing the corruption .\nBut of course , that happens .\nIn the case of the Biogen whistleblower , Inman

decline to participate in cases and then turn around and stop a whistleblower from challenging fraud , it would be another example of the court catering to corporate power .\nIt would fundamentally

State , Incarcerated Organizers Build Community With Youth To Fight For Releases This article was funded by the Marvel Cooke Fellowship .\nRead more about this reporting project and make a contribution to fund our fellowship budget .\nAt Washington \u2019 s Stafford Creek Corrections Center , a group of incarcerated organizers have built community with local youths to fight for sentencing reforms , grappling with what it means to organize through an abolitionist lens from inside .\nThe Cultural Collective at Stafford Creek is a grassroots organization comprised of leaders from various independent cultural groups that include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Black Prisoners Caucus , Nuestro Grupo Cultural ( formerly Hispanic Cultural Group ) , and Native American Circle .\nTogether , they are using every tool at their disposal\u2014from building relationships around art with youth in the community to fighting for legislative change\u2014that could potentially free people .\nWhile prison has widely been regarded as a place that thrives on violence , isolation , and division , the Cultural Collective transcends negative stereotypes by working in solidarity to uplift the voices of those most marginalized , and empowering those directly impacted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been guided by the legacies of the community and prison organizers who came before them , each respective group , despite the lack of support from local administration , has been dedicated to serving their community and building life affirming institutions .\nThese groups organize youth summits , immigration seminars , cultural classes , social justice forums , and provide platforms for their peers to contribute positively to their communities .\nCommunity organizing has always been essential to survival for the incarcerated .\nWhether folks are getting together to demand better medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to quality education and resources , striving for space to keep cultural traditions alive , or fighting for sentencing relief through legislation , prison organizing has always been a struggle borne out of necessity .\nAs prison organizing for criminal justice reforms flourished over the last decade , the Cultural Collective demonstrated that reforms within the current system will never be enough : that true change can only come from a movement that is of and by the people \u2014 a movement grounded in abolishing the prison industrial complex and cultivating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state \u2019 s 2022 legislative session , members of the Cultural Collective were approached by several of their peers for updates on upcoming bills that could potentially affect prisoners , and asked what work was being done to pass these bills .\nAs outlined in a Change.org petition , there were four bills in particular that Cultural Collective members decided to push forward .\nThe first , HB 1413 , would have retroactively eliminated juvenile felonies in the calculation of adult sentences and ensure adults were eligible for resentencing if they had juvenile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1282 was intended to expand \u201c earned release time \u201d to 33 percent of the total sentence that an individual serves .\nCurrently , earned time is capped at 10 percent for violent convictions .\nA third bill , HB 1344 , would expand the pool of people eligible to have their sentences reviewed by the Washington State Indeterminate Sentencing Review Board .\nPeople who were under the age of 25 when their crime was committed could have their sentence reviewed after they served 15 years , or 25 years for those convicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1169 would have significantly altered guidelines around the application of sentencing enhancements and provide judges greater sentencing and resentencing discretion , which could have also applied retroactively .\nBecause Washington state has some of the strictest sentencing laws in the nation and eliminated its parole system back in 1984 , a change in the law may be the only hope at freedom for multitudes of prisoners stuck behind bars facing significant time .\nAlthough legislative work does not traditionally align with the Cultural Collective \u2019 s abolitionist principles , this interaction with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization to at least have a conversation about possible steps moving forward , and what they could do to still be a voice and presence for their peers .\nSome abolitionists are wary of legislative reform approaches because of their propensity to be co-opted or watered down by legislators .\nMajor reform efforts , like the First Step Act , are seen as too piecemeal or failing to go far enough .\nOften more organized and law enforcement-adjacent groups can create devastating exemptions and loopholes in these efforts that fail to address core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them .\nInstead , some abolitionist organizers have prioritized other approaches , like community building and mutual aid , clemency campaigns , prisoner defense committees , and more .\nWhile those organizing from the inside with the Cultural Collective align more with the latter , they also believe that any changes that do not shift power away from the system and back to the community are shortsighted and have the potential to only strengthen a system that must be dismantled .\nAs the former president of the Clallam Bay Corrections Center \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCCC chapter , I have argued for a more traditional approach .\nI \u2019 ve contended the group should be more focused on dismantling the whole system .\nAnd that by dedicating limited group resources to a legislative process that has a history of deliberately excluding us , we would not only be stretching thin our resources , but legitimizing an inequitable and racist system .\nShowing the complexity of abolition , other members like 31 year old Billy Gumabon , who currently serves as SCCC \u2019 s APICAG president , explained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot more complicated when you \u2019 re \u201c literally in the eye of the storm.\n\u201d Gumabon , a Filipino-American incarcerated since he was 18 years old , spoke from his own experience and demonstrated the realities of being trapped in the system .\n\u201c There are inner contradictions that must be addressed while striving for a better society , \u201d he said .\n\u201c I believe that most folks who disagree with legislation or believe that legislation is contradictory to abolition are [ oftentimes ] those who aren \u2019 t directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I personally see abolition as a process .\n[ Positive legislation ] can help us take steps towards it.\n\u201d Cyril Walrond , the 33 year old president of SCCC \u2019 s chapter of the BPC who was recently released from prison , suggested that the organization did not have to be one dimensional and that the organization \u2019 s approach should be as nuanced as the oppression they endure .\nThere were opportunities through the legislative process , he said , to \u201c educate the community that reform does not go far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never will.\n\u201d \u201c As directly impacted people , organizing from within prison , and suffering under the oppressive and inhumane conditions of the carceral system , our organizing remains rooted in abolition , \u201d Walrond said .\nThe Cultural Collective decided to advocate and support the four bills that their peers identified and felt would make the most impact and still align with their mission to undo the harms of disproportionate sentencing as a result of institutional racism .\nThey agreed that they would do so only by centering the voices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and according to their abolitionist principles .\nAt a later APICAG board meeting , leaders discussed how they could contribute to the broader Cultural Collective agenda , and what steps needed to be taken in order to center the voices of those directly impacted .\nBecause the four bills mainly focused on those convicted as youth/young adults\u2014primarily those from black and brown communities\u2014it was imperative that whatever steps were to be taken , they had to include youth of color .\nThis sentiment was shared with the broader Cultural Collective , and everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving forward .\nAlthough there were many nonprofit organizations and sentencing coalitions in the community that were already working on legislation , they were not necessarily accountable to the incarcerated people who they would ultimately impact .\nThe Cultural Collective decided to bypass those \u201c professional \u201d lobbyists and began reaching out directly to youth organizations in the community to discuss a possible collaboration .\nOne of the organizations that responded to the invitation was the Youth Consortium ( YC ) , which , like the Cultural Collective , consists of young activists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater Seattle area .\nThis includes Creative Justice , Community Passageways , and the Rainier Beach Action Coalition .\nThese youth have been working to better their own future , fighting for , and eventually procuring resources last year , to build a Youth Achievement Center .\nIt is currently under construction in Seattle .\nWhile each individual member of YC has their own unique story , one thing is clear : these young leaders are a force to be reckoned with , and have demonstrated that they are the future of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call with YC staff and youth leadership , I pitched the idea to collect personal stories from prisoners about how their incarceration has affected them and their families and how the legislation could potentially provide them with sentencing relief .\nWe turned those stories over to YC youth , and eventually collaborated on a visual arts project that could be shared with the community and legislators .\nThe intention was to bring life to statistics and humanize bills that have oftentimes only been used as political bargaining chips .\nIn the following months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekly calls with YC leadership , giving prisoners the opportunity to engage directly with the youth and answer any questions they may have had .\nWhile many of the conversations were centered around prisoners \u2019 stories , there were opportunities for youth who had experienced the incarceration of a family member to ask questions about what life was like on the inside , and unpack some of the trauma this situation creates .\nThese organic exchanges made space for prisoners to share their experiences in their hopes of preventing more youth from following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not just a group , but a family to me , \u201d said one YC leader , who goes by the name Carmeezzy .\n\u201c When I first joined , I was welcomed with open arms .\nIt \u2019 s a safe place to me , but also somewhere where I feel comfortable that my voice will be heard.\n\u201d \u201c YC is a place where we can talk about many issues in our community\u2014for example , problems in prisons .\nWe got to hear stories from people who are actually in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got sentenced wrongly .\nWe really got to hear from them and their stories , rather than what the system just tells us [ about them ] , \u201d they said .\n\u201c I learned so much at YC .\nYou really get the opportunity to be a leader and a listener .\nYou get to grow together with [ other ] youth as a family .\nWe help each other\u2026 even our family in prison because we all are family.\n\u201d This unique process created space for intergenerational conversations about current social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn some of the calls , there was also a lot of past trauma that was unpacked and real connections were made .\nThe experience also inspired the youth to write their own stories to share .\nDawit , a 20 year-old member of YC by way of Community Passageways , said he \u201c noticed a similarity between youth and incarcerated organizers.\n\u201d \u201c Legislators and other powerful people use our voices only until they get our stories [ and support ] to help them with a particular agenda .\nThen they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c However , with this project , the youth and organizers at SCCC were in control of our stories and the organization of events .\nIn doing so , we amplified our own voices with our own capacities to achieve our own goals.\n\u201d For Dawit , a major lesson of the collaboration was \u201c that our struggles are all connected .\nFrom the side of the youth , we \u2019 ve realized that the stories of the organizers inside aren \u2019 t very different from ours .\nPoverty , violence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although some more than others.\n\u201d \u201c I \u2019 ve learned that we , the youth , need to work together and draw inspiration from the strong organizers inside in order to battle these issues as we come of age.\n\u201d Throughout the process , the project grew and evolved to be much more than creating art or just a material product .\nIt built community connections , promoted youth leadership , addressed injustices , and centered the voices of those most impacted and marginalized in an effort to truly bring about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a platform for imaginations to grow , while also growing what abolition could truly look like right now .\nThings didn \u2019 t always move as smoothly as they could have .\nA few unexpected obstacles due to COVID-19 and a simultaneous Tuberculosis outbreak at SCCC presented many challenges for the men on the inside .\n\u201c We were subjected to inhumane living conditions everyday , \u201d said Billy Gumabon .\n\u201c Our mental and physical health was being negatively impacted .\n[ Because of this ] , the youth from YC stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big way in taking the lead in this project.\n\u201d But with obstacles came creative ingenuity and strength .\n\u201c We had to find new ways of communicating and coordinating , \u201d said Cyril Walrond .\n\u201c We would go outside [ when allowed to ] in the cold and rain to strategize across razor-wired fences .\nWe did what we had to because we knew this work was bigger than us.\n\u201d \u201c It was deeper work rooted in abolition and liberation aimed at building and empowering community in order to challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power structure , \u201d Walrond said .\n\u201c I \u2019 d say the biggest output is the relationship formed between the organizers and organizers inside , \u201d Dawit remarked .\n\u201c Throughout our calls , we \u2019 ve planned and executed several things .\nWe \u2019 ve also laughed , shared stories , and formed relationships that we won \u2019 t forget .\nAlthough we mostly met online and over the phone , we \u2019 ve grown to know each other \u2019 s names , voices , and work.\n\u201d \u201c I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ] carry on and have a more immediate effect on the the next generation , \u201d he said .\nOn February 19 , 2022 YC hosted a virtual event to provide an opportunity for more people in the community to be a part of , and contribute to , this unique experience .\nThey shared recordings and pictures of prisoners , who submitted stories and testimony of how the project has impacted them .\nThe youth read stories from the inside , as well as recordings of prisoners reading youth stories .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ YC youth unveiled t-shirts they had printed that were designed by incarcerated artists with messages that embodied the spirit of the program .\nSome read \u201c Liberation \u201d to remind the community of what the groups were all striving for .\nOthers had pictures of cracked microphones and slogans that read \u201c Project : Broken Mic \u201d to symbolize the marginalization of prisoner and youth voices , and their intention to uplift these voices by repairing their \u201c mics \u201d and making all their voices heard .\nNathan , a 19 year-old member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virtual event , said , \u201c [ Our ] hope was to bring awareness to our community .\n[ We wanted ] to break the silence and disprove any lies and myths [ about our incarcerated family ] created by the people from the top , and give folks [ trapped ] by the system a second chance.\n\u201d \u201c Letting them tell their stories and speak from experience to give future generations a new perspective on their lives , to improve themselves and the people around them , \u201d he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous success , also dealt with some unexpected setbacks .\nThe forum was briefly hijacked by a \u201c Zoom-bomber \u201d spewing hateful rhetoric and displaying inappropriate images .\nBut organizers thought quickly on their feet , and handled the tomfoolery with the class and elegance of the well-seasoned organizers they \u2019 ve proven to be .\n\u201c Some things didn \u2019 t entirely go as planned , but some quick thinking brought us back onto the right track , \u201d Nathan explained .\n\u201c Even though we had some unexpected guests and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team clutched the event and managed to pull it off.\n\u201d At the conclusion of the event , there was a call to action for the community to support the legislation prioritized by the Cultural Collective .\nThe youth shared what came of the process thus far , and there was a consensus commitment to continue to build and expand to other prisons , and include more youth moving forward .\nAs the Washington State legislative session came to a disappointing close , and none of the bills were passed , all participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created was more meaningful than any bill\u2014that abolition is a living and breathing process .\nThat change does not come from a few reformist bills , but rather the connections made between those most marginalized in order to rebuild and reimagine community .\nCurrently , plans are still being discussed to continue connecting , and utilizing this model to address broader social issues plaguing the community .\nZines , documentaries , liberation art , community organizing classes , and other uplifting projects are all on the table as the groups continue to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also devising a plan to garner more support and possibly support resurrecting the bills that were not passed during the 2022 session .\nThey intend to expand their work to other men \u2019 s prisons , as well as women \u2019 s prisons .\nThe collaboration between YC and the Cultural Collective continues to demonstrate that abolition is not just about tearing down prisons\u2014although that is an essential part of it .\nAbolition is also about building meaningful relationships that empower those directly impacted by State oppression , uplifting the voices of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system in which all our needs are met .\nBy embracing each others experiences and histories , YC and the Cultural Collective are making sure that their people are surviving today\u2013while also laying the foundation for a brighter future .\nSpecial thanks to Youth Consortium staff and coordinators for making this project possible .", "author": "Felix Sitthivong", "url":

Toxic Masculinity In The Will to Change : Men , Masculinity and Change , bell hooks warns that it isn \u2019 t true that men are unwilling to change ; they are actually afraid to change .\n\u201c It is true that masses of men have not even begun to look at the ways that patriarchy keeps them from knowing themselves , from being in touch with their feelings , from loving , \u201d hooks writes in the 2004 edition of the book .\n\u201c To know love , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the will to dominate .\nThey must be able to choose life over death .\nThey must be willing to change.\n\u201d In 2014 , Charles Berry and Richie \u201c Reseda \u201d Edmond-Vargas put hooks \u2019 words to the test by co-founding the Success Stories Program at the California Training Facility prison .\nThe program is dedicated to treating some of the root causes of harm and violence\u2014patriarchy and toxic masculinity\u2014among people who are criminalized and incarcerated .\nAlso known as \u201c The Feminist on Cellblock Y , \u201d after being featured in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Edmond-Vargas noticed an oversight in the programs offered to prisoners in California .\nThough there were instructional workshops on topics like anger management and substance abuse , none of the education on offer actually got to the heart of the problem : patriarchy .\n\u201c Most behavioral issues , they \u2019 re all steeped in patriarchy , but nobody was talking about it [ in prison ] .\n\u201d Mannie Thomas III , Coach and Growth Coordinator of Success Stories and a previous participant of the program , said .\n\u201c Richie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s bouncing around the idea of masculinity and patriarchy , and no one \u2019 s really talking about it.\n\u201d Edmond-Vargas took that oversight as an opportunity to speak about patriarchy at the gym , where he was laughed out of the room .\nHe persisted , and through trial and error and conversation with Transformational Coach and Growth Coordinator Chris Johnson , came up with a method of sharing experiences in a conversational setting that started reaching incarcerated men and encouraging them to change .\n\u201c Once we started to share very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen is people \u2019 s ability to relate to the topic , the topic became real , right ?\n\u201d Thomas explained .\n\u201c When you \u2019 re talking to a group of cisgender men about how patriarchy informs their life , and how it may keep them from being the highest version of themselves , or how it \u2019 s harming their community\u2014before we told our stories , they couldn \u2019 t really make the correlation.\n\u201d Success Stories became a 12-week program where men are encouraged to reassess how they live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live more fully through the rejection of patriarchal values and toxic masculinity .\nThe participants of the program meet once a week for two hours at a time and go through myriad topics .\nThrough exchanging stories and experiences on what matters most in the lives of the participants , participants redefine what \u2019 s most important to them .\nAfter exploring the root causes of male violence , facilitators offer what they see as the remedy for patriarchy : integrity and relearning how to feel emotions .\n\u201c We realized that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole don \u2019 t have complex language to express complex emotions because we don \u2019 t do it often , \u201d Thomas said .\n\u201c So we have a conversation about love and what it means , because we realize that most of us grew up with the definition of love that may not actually be that .\nAnd then we \u2019 ll talk about our belief system and how it influences our behavior.\n\u201d In many ways , Success Stories is deconstructing and reconstructing the ways marginalized men relate to the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEdward Munsuer , who attended the program while incarcerated , says that he learned another way to be a man through the workshops .\n\u201c Most men focus on violence , money , and women , as well as repressing and covering up their true emotions , \u201d Munsuer said .\n\u201c The world makes us think that if we have the hottest girl , or the most money , or we are the toughest and punk people , or beat people up , then we are the coolest and everybody will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with love and equality , the world becomes a better place.\n\u201d The program also powerfully teaches men how to love in healthy ways , recognizing that patriarchy and toxic masculinity might have hindered their ability to give and receive love .\nIn a page of Munsuer \u2019 s notes during the program , he wrote down the \u201c seven A \u2019 s of love \u201d taught in the course : action , attention , acceptance , appreciation , affection , affirmations and actualization .\nNext to each word , Monsuer noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today he puts the lessons in practice .\n\u201c My experience with Success Stories was quite profound , \u201d he said .\n\u201c It truly opened my eyes to focus on what \u2019 s important in life , as well as love for others.\n\u201d The program also has a recommended list of books to accompany the conversations and learning experiences .\nAll About Love , The Will to Change , and We Real Cool\u2014all by bell hooks\u2014are a few of the readings recommended to participants .\nAccording to Thomas , the reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help men understand they are operating within a system of patriarchal capitalist exploitation .\n\u201c The thing that we \u2019 ve noticed about patriarchy and misogyny is that men feel like that we \u2019 re the only ones going through this , \u201d Thomas said .\n\u201c And a lot of us don \u2019 t even recognise that we \u2019 re working within a system .\nSo when you have the opportunity to read the literature , it makes it more real , because it \u2019 s like\u2014oh , this isn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program is that it \u2019 s designed to reach all kinds of people from all kinds of backgrounds , and lead them to understand , together , that patriarchy and toxic masculinity have been imposed onto their lives from an early age .\nThe collective discovery fosters a feeling of comradery and companionship that is the polar opposite of the isolation of patriarchy .\n\u201c We were all given this template about masculinity and because we are part of this patriarchal system , we \u2019 ve experienced a lot of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c This opens up the door for people to be more truthful and vulnerable , because they \u2019 re seeing somebody who \u2019 s experienced the same thing .\nAnd it alleviates this isolation that we feel as men because , as men , we \u2019 re not told to help each other out .\nSome of the participants are doing that for the first time , it \u2019 s not comfortable for them , but it \u2019 s relieving and it \u2019 s healing.\n\u201d The program has faced resistance and challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was skeptical of Edmond-Vargas when they first met in the prison yard .\nThomas made a comment about Edmond-Vargas tattoo being gay , and his response was so non-accusatory and open-ended that Thomas became intrigued .\n\u201c He was like : \u2018 Have you ever considered that the way that you use language perpetuates the oppression of other people ?\n\u2019 I was like , bro , you \u2019 re doing too much .\nAnd I was arrogant at the time .\nBut then it was just eating at me , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I missing ?\nSo I asked him about the group.\n\u201d The resistance Thomas described in himself , often held by some participants of the program , is overcome through the sharing of personal experiences with other men .\nThis exchange exposes the similarities of the participants \u2019 stories , and how patriarchy encouraged them to be violent to prove themselves as men .\nFrom that point on , ignoring patriarchy as an active force in their lives becomes impossible , and so the work begins .\nBut the most impactful part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politic behind its work and scope , is that it \u2019 s helping men be released from prison early with a better perspective on how to live a full life .\nWhile Thomas doesn \u2019 t have data to share on the

censored parts of Chelsea Manning \u2019 s new book , where she attempted to describe the information she provided to WikiLeaks in 2010 .\nManning says she wrote README.txt because she had not really been able to tell her story , and this the book was a \u201c first draft of history \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did testify a little bit during the court-martial , my voice has been kind of lost during this whole process , \u201d Manning declared on \u201c CBS Mornings.\n\u201d However , the US government used the publication review system to block her from highlighting any of the documents from the Afghanistan War Logs , Iraq War Logs , or US Embassy cables that garnered widespread news headlines .\n\u201c At the end of July , WLO [ WikiLeaks organization ] had uploaded seventy-five thousand records from what became known as the Afghan war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guardian , The New York Times , and Der Spiegel copublished them , \u201d Manning recalls .\n\u201c ( The Iraq documents would be published later . )\nPublic sentiment , already turning against the war , dipped still more with facts revealed in the documents\u2014 \u201d The dash on the page leads to six black bars that hide what Manning had hoped to highlight for readers .\nText resumes with , \u201c The fallout from the release of Afghan SIGACTS [ war logs ] was instant and intense .\nThe documents proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disastrous the war still was.\n\u201d Specifics from the disaster that were detailed in the files Manning revealed are stricken from the pages .\nDo you support independent journalism ?\nThen leave us a tip Manning was detained and held in harsh confinement at the Quantico Marine brig when the Iraq War Logs were released .\nShe was \u201c too disconnected to notice , too preoccupied with surviving with my faculties intact \u201d to know that her disclosures were still the subject of \u201c international media attention.\n\u201d \u201c What I now know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of journalistic outlets\u2014The New York Times , The Guardian , Al Jazeera , Le Monde , the Bureau of Investigative Journalism , the Iraq Body Count Project , and Der Spiegel\u2014partnered with one another and with WikiLeaks to publish the next round of disclosures : what became known as the Iraq war logs , more than 390,000 documents.\n\u201d Two to three paragraphs of black bars follow .\nThe US government refused to allow Manning to write about anything related to documents , which captured moments in a war and occupation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of Iraq .\nIn the section on the US embassy cables , Manning describes how the files offered a \u201c stunning look behind the curtain and showed just how frankly our officials talked in private about other countries and the way the United States threw its weight around on the international stage.\n\u201d \u201c Journalists immediately started using the cables to fact-check , to get a deeper understanding of the powerful institutions they covered , and to uncover new truths , \u201d Manning adds .\nYet as far as examples go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cables and news stories that mention them , were deprived of further details because the US government censored much of this page during their publication review .\nCan Manning really tell her story if she can not speak about details in the documents , especially those which had a positive impact on our world ?\nThis is all part of the US military weaponizing the classification system against Manning , which is what she contends Major Ashden Fein consistently did when he was the lead military prosecutor in her court-martial .\n\u201c [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of information possible be released publicly\u2014with huge redactions in even that .\nMy right to a fair public trial was annihilated because of the very structure of my court-martial , \u201d Manning argues .\n\u201c Actually , it was effectively two courts-martial : there were the hearings that the world saw , and then there were the classified hearings , which were completely sealed.\n\u201d The classified hearings not only presented a \u201c fuller picture of what had led up to my decision , \u201d but according to Manning , \u201c just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me appeared only in the classified evidence .\nTwenty-four of the witnesses the prosecution called gave their testimony , at least in part , under those conditions of secrecy.\n\u201d I covered Chelsea Manning \u2019 s trial extensively , and this is true .\nIn fact , I don \u2019 t know if I can really say I covered Manning \u2019 s entire case cause I was not in the courtroom for classified hearings .\nJudge Colonel Denise Lind maintained , \u2018 The overriding interest of protecting national security information from disclosure outweighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c In other words , the very thing that helped me decide that leaking was worth it\u2014the arbitrary , self-dealing , and occasionally manipulative use of the classification system\u2014 [ was ] weaponized against me , \u201d Manning declares .\nAs Manning puts it , \u201c The control this gave the government verged on Kafkaesque .\nFor example , the cables that I had leaked , which anyone in the world could call up via a simple Google search , remained classified.\n\u201d A Security Regime That Pretends To Be Blind and Deaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in December 2011 when the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) requested twenty-three diplomatic cables , and the State Department responded with eleven censored cables .\nOfficials also refused to release twelve cables and revealed a \u201c roadmap \u201d for classification decisions .\n\u201c The information released by the State Department is perhaps more sensitive than the cables themselves , revealing what the government thinks the public should and should not be able to see , \u201d Anna Estevao and Nathan Freed Wessler wrote for the ACLU .\n\u201c The government redacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released to us .\nBut because WikiLeaks has already published the full text of each cable , we know what \u2019 s underneath those redactions.\n\u201d The State Department \u201c claimed the authority to conceal information that is embarrassing to or critical of the government , like criticism of the CIA \u2019 s black-site prison program and treatment of Guantanamo detainees , while releasing information that paints the US in a positive light .\nThe government also redacted multiple passages containing information that has long been publicly available , such as the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military jet traversed Swiss airspace on the day the CIA kidnapped cleric Abu Omar from Milan.\n\u201d Referring to the twelve cables that the State Department withheld as the \u201c dirty dozen , \u201d Estevao and Wessler highlighted their contents .\nLike Estevao and Wessler asserted , the information could not do more \u201c harm \u201d to \u201c national security \u201d if released because the information was already public .\nAny \u201c damage \u201d was done when leaked .\nBut the State Department hid \u201c behind a security regime that pretends to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say something is secret , people don \u2019 t actually know it .\nThis twisted logic defies reason and serves the government \u2019 s desire to only be held accountable for information and actions they choose to admit.\n\u201d That security regime , which pretends to be blind and deaf , is the same one that benefits from a US court system that protects its authority to censor former US intelligence and military employees like Chelsea Manning .\nPresident Barack Obama may have commuted Manning \u2019 s sentence , but she will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case for all military or national security whistleblowers prosecuted under the Espionage Act , the US government may forever instill fear that FBI agents could come to her home and take her off to jail if she dares to speak about the \u201c classified information \u201d \u2014information we all

Assange This article was funded by paid subscribers of The Dissenter Newsletter and first published at TheDissenter.org .\nBecome an annual paid subscriber to help us continue our independent journalism .\nIn the United States government \u2019 s case against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , prosecutors claim that he communicated with US Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning through an encrypted chat client known as Jabber .\nProsecutors highlight several alleged exchanges between Manning and a username , or handle , associated with Assange .\nYet they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manning was chatting with Assange , and Manning \u2019 s new book , README.txt , further complicates their case .\nManning recalls in February 2010 that she told a chat room with individuals she believed to be associated with WikiLeaks that they could expect an \u201c important submission.\n\u201d She received a response from someone with the handle \u201c office , \u201d who changed their handle to \u201c pressassociation.\n\u201d At this time , Manning had prepared what became known as the \u201c Collateral Murder \u201d video for submission to WikiLeaks .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baghdad by US soldiers that killed two Reuters journalists , Saeed Chmagh and Namir Noor-Eldeen , and Saleh Matasher Tomal , a good Samaritan who pulled up in a van and tried to help the wounded .\n\u201c We eventually began to talk on another encrypted chat client , Jabber , and I saved the person in my contacts as \u2018 Nathaniel Frank , \u2019 a decoy that was an homage to the author of a book I \u2019 d read the previous year ( Unfriendly Fire : How the Gay Ban Undermines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Manning writes .\nConsistent with the statement she delivered during her court-martial in February 2013 , she adds , \u201c I never knew for sure who the real person was behind the \u2018 Nathaniel Frank \u2019 handles .\nOver time , and from the role he played in the chat room , I came to understand this was an important person in the group.\n\u201d \u201c I guessed it was likely Julian Assange , or maybe Daniel Schmitt ( now known as Daniel Domscheit-Berg ) , another central figure in WLO [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone representing them .\nTo this day , I can \u2019 t say with absolute certainty who it was ; that \u2019 s the point of having a handle online , of course .\nThere are no driver \u2019 s licenses presented in the hacking world.\n\u201d Manning mentions that she used a \u201c random name generator \u201d to get her handle : DawgNetwork .\nDo you support independent journalism ?\nThen leave us a tip In the indictment against Assange , prosecutors state , \u201c No later than January 2010 , Manning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ Jabber ] , to chat with Assange , who used multiple monikers attributable to him.\n\u201d \u201c The grand jury will allege that the person using these monikers is Assange without reference to the specific moniker used , \u201d according to the indictment .\nThis illustrates the intent of US prosecutors to rely upon circumstantial evidence to tie Assange to the account , like they did during Manning \u2019 s court-martial .\nHowever , as was true during the court-martial , the government still can not prove Assange was the WikiLeaks associate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moniker.\n\u201d During a four-week extradition hearing in September 2020 , Assange \u2019 s legal team had Patrick Eller , a command digital forensic examiner responsible for a team of more than eighty examiners at US Army Criminal Investigation Command headquarters , provide testimony to the UK district court .\nHe had access to the court-martial record .\nEller said that he was unable to find any evidence that linked Assange to the \u201c Nathaniel Frank \u201d account .\nNow , in a government affidavit from 2019 , assistant US attorney Kellen Dwyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FBI interviewed in 2011 , who will testify that Assange used the pressassociation account .\nThe witness is a woman who was \u201c romantically involved \u201d with Assange and met him in Berlin in 2009 .\nDwyer also indicates that Siggi Thordarson , an FBI informant from Iceland who is a diagnosed sociopath and serial criminal , will testify that Assange used \u201c pressassociation \u201d as \u201c one of his online nicknames.\n\u201d None of this featured in the extradition proceedings , and Crown prosecutors did not contest Mark Summers QC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eller address the lack of proof that Assange used the account that chatted with Manning .\nProsecutors subpoenaed Manning to testify before a grand jury in January 2019 , and they likely hoped they could coerce her into answering questions about her chats with this particular account .\nBut Manning was steadfast , maintained her grand jury resistance for nearly a year , and prosecutors were never able to elicit any testimony that could be used against Assange .\nHer book should help Assange \u2019 s legal team establish reasonable doubt that Assange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can show that other WikiLeaks associates had access to the account for chatting with potential sources .\nContesting The US Government \u2019 s Theory In The Assange Case The US government \u2019 s theory of the case against Assange depends upon a narrative that involves Assange recruiting Manning to leak documents to WikiLeaks .\nFacts of the case have always conflicted with this conspiracy theory , and Manning raises a few of these facts .\n\u201c [ Major Ashden ] Fein tried to make it seem like I \u2019 d started hunting around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I got to Iraq .\nHe pointed to a list they posted of they \u2018 Most Wanted Leaks \u2019 for 2009 , and tried to claim that I \u2019 d been looking for the Garani video in November , just two weeks after I \u2019 d gotten to Iraq.\n\u201d This backfired , according to Manning .\n\u201c First of all , we has evidence that I hadn \u2019 t uploaded the Garani video until the spring of 2010 .\nSecond , the video wasn \u2019 t even on the \u2018 Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast majority of things I \u2019 d posted weren \u2019 t on it either.\n\u201d \u201c In late March , \u201d as Manning details , searching through the CENTCOM directory for information I needed for my job , I discovered a video of a 2009 air strike in Garani , Afghanistan .\nMore than one hundred Afghani civilians , mostly women and children , were accidentally killed , and the air strike had been covered all over the world.\n\u201d \u201c It was chilling to see death on that scale , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were even more disturbing to me than the ones for the video that became known as \u2018 Collateral Murder . '\n\u201d Manning adds , \u201c What I was saw indelible and awful : graphic footage of women , children , and old people dying the most painful kind of death , a result of munitions containing white phosphorus hitting an extremely flammable structure.\n\u201d She submitted the Garani video to WikiLeaks , but the video was never published .\nThe US government \u2019 s report on what resulted in the deaths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classified.\n\u201d An exchange with \u201c Nathaniel Frank \u201d about the detainee assessment briefs , which were published as the \u201c Gitmo Files , \u201d is highlighted in the book .\nIn the indictment against Assange , this exchange is the first alleged exchange between Manning and the person who prosecutors insist\u2014without proof\u2014was Assange .\n\u201c I asked \u2018 Nathaniel Frank \u2019 \u2014on March 7 , the day of the Iraqi elections\u2014what he thought .\nWere they worth publishing ?\n\u201d Manning shares .\n\u201c He told me that it probably wouldn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps they could be of use to the individual detainees in their legal battles , and that they seemed important for filling out the general historical record of the Guantanamo detainments.\n\u201d What Manning writes aligns with the indictment , although the indictment is more vague .\n\u201c Manning asked Assange how valuable the Guantanamo Bay detainee assessments would be , \u201d and the account that prosecutors associate with Assange confirmed they had value .\nManning engaged in chats with \u201c Nathaniel Frank \u201d because she yearned for a personal connection with anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest to her .\nThey exchanged messages on politics and information technology .\n\u201c Soon , we were talking almost every day , sometimes for almost an hour at a time , about a range of topics , not just whatever publications WikiLeaks was preparing , \u201d Manning recounts .\n\u201c I felt freer to be myself thanks to the cloak of anonymity the encrypted chat provided , and that was a lifeline to me then .\nIt was an escape from the pressure and anxiety of the deployment.\n\u201d \u201c In retrospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me than it did to \u2018 Nathaniel Frank , \u2019 and that our closeness was an artificial , circumstantial one .\nBut I so badly needed an escape valve , and some semblance of friendship and trust.\n\u201d This is the first

\u2018Project\u2019 That Targeted US Communications", "content": "This article was funded by paid subscribers of The Dissenter Newsletter .\nBecome an annual paid subscriber to help us continue our coverage of whistleblowers .\nA National Security Agency whistleblower unearthed a hot-shot analyst \u2019 s unauthorized \u201c project \u201d that targeted the communications of citizens or persons in the United States , according to a top secret inspector general report from 2016 .\nThe project , or \u201c experiment , \u201d was not approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , the attorney general , the NSA director , or the director for the division that handles signals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the analyst \u2019 s chain of command or any NSA officers responsible for oversight .\nJournalist Jason Leopold obtained a highly censored version of the 2016 report through a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuit and co-authored a paywalled article about what that report revealed for Bloomberg .\nOn March 18 , 2013 , only a few months before NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden exposed several of the NSA \u2019 s mass surveillance programs , a whistleblower stumbled upon a colleague who was collecting or attempting to collect a \u201c large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence purpose.\n\u201d The whistleblower , or \u201c source , \u201d who was a \u201c global network analyst , \u201d complained to several offices tasked with oversight .\nThey then shared what they found with the inspector general \u2019 s office in May , and on June 18 , while the NSA reeled from the unprecedented scrutiny brought about by Snowden \u2019 s disclosures , they contacted the Office of General Counsel , which is the NSA \u2019 s legal office .\nA group of \u201c management officials \u201d at the NSA considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email exchanges , but even with the fallout from Snowden , they largely maintained that the concerns were unfounded .\nThe unauthorized project started collecting\u2014or attempting to collect data\u2014that included US persons \u2019 communications as early as 2012 .\nAccording to the whistleblower , multiple people in NSA oversight positions lacked the technical expertise to understand what the analyst was doing with their project .\nThey did not understand why the analyst \u2019 s collection was in violation of clear procedures .\nThe inspector general concluded , \u201c Although [ the analyst ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials , and attorneys that his activities were acceptable , he was told by others to stop immediately.\n\u201d \u201c [ The analyst ] acted with reckless disregard of the regulations , policies , and procedures that governed the use of the SIGINT system , \u201d the inspector general added , which essentially means he abused his access to programs that enabled mass surveillance .\nIt is unclear if the analyst who acted recklessly suffered any consequences .\nHe obviously was not prosecuted for engaging in misconduct .\n\u201c When I said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NSA I could pull the communications of anyone who passed through our net\u2014including Americans\u2014officials hotly contested the claim and a lot of folks believed them , \u201d Snowden told Bloomberg .\n\u201c But it was true , as the NSA itself secretly acknowledges.\n\u201d Snowden continued , \u201c Defenders of broad surveillance authorities always insist that Americans don \u2019 t have to worry because our intelligence agencies are tightly constrained by law and policy .\nBut time and again we \u2019 ve seen that when laws are violated and powers are abused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , as Leopold highlighted , on April 21 , 2014 , a year into the investigation by the inspector general , the whistleblower contacted the office again to allege that the analyst was still targeting US communications .\n\u201c I wasn \u2019 t sure whether to report it or wait till he actually gets collection ( if any ) , \u201d the whistleblower wrote .\n\u201c Also wasn \u2019 t sure whether to send the information to you or file a new report with the IG hotline.\n\u201d The NSA employee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inspector general \u2019 s investigation and asserted that his \u201c project \u201d fell under Executive Order 12333 , which is a toothless presidential order that US security agencies have invoked to justify the expansion of mass surveillance .\nAsked about the \u201c foreign intelligence purpose \u201d of the project , the analyst told the inspector general that it was to \u201c make the collection system healthier , the analytic powers richer , and the system more efficient.\n\u201d ( Part of his response was censored in the declassified report . )\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for permission to pursue the project and had been told to \u201c stop the project.\n\u201d At least a few NSA employees saw it as an \u201c experiment.\n\u201d There was no audit mechanism for ensuring the project was compliant with NSA procedures .\nThe inspector general \u2019 s report said , \u201c He was the only person working on the project , and each day he did not know what he might try to do , what made sense , was easily sustainable , repeatable , and defensible.\n\u201d He proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat of his pants.\n\u201d As Demand Progress , an advocacy organization which has challenged abuses of power that threaten civil liberties , noted , the investigation pointed to Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) that contains \u201c Section 702 , \u201d which the US government has \u201c abused for years to knowingly access Americans \u2019 communications without a warrant.\n\u201d \u201c The congressional intelligence committees have claimed to be robust overseers of intelligence agencies .\nIf accurate , this inspector general report should not only be known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of serious investigation , \u201d declared Sean Vitka , a senior policy council for Demand Progress .\n\u201c We call on the House and Senate intelligence committees to release what they know , including how many people this illegal activity impacted , what punishments the people involved faced , and what the committees have done to ensure this never happens again.\n\u201d \u201c The government has abused its surveillance powers for too long and blatantly disregarded the privacy rights of the American people .\nLike the FBI \u2019 s recent wrongful spying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community leaders , this adds to the mounting evidence that Title VII is simply too dangerous to reauthorize ,

weeks earlier he suffered a stroke .\nHe fronted Lavender Country which is widely believed to be the first openly gay country band .\nIn 1973 , they released their self-titled debut often cited as the first gay-themed country album .\nInitially , there were only 1000 copies printed .\nThe album later garnered interest from historians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn 2014 , the album was reissued by the Paradise of Bachelors label .\nHaggerty also embarked on a nationwide tour , which introduced a new generation to his music .\nPaying tribute to Haggerty , Paradise of Bachelors co-founder Brendan Greaves wrote : \u201c He was more than a hero ; he was also a friend , mentor , comrade , and fatherly figure for us and our families .\nHe was hilarious too ; it was always an adventure spending time with him.\n\u201d In 2019 , Lavender Country released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThree years later , the album received increased exposure when it was reissued by Don Giovanni Records .\n\u201c Patrick Haggerty was one of the funniest , kindest , bravest , and smartest people I ever met , \u201d Don Giovanni Records stated .\n\u201c He never gave up fighting for what he believed in , and those around him who he loved and took care of will continue that fight.\n\u201d As an openly gay artist in a conservative genre , simply creating music was a political statement , especially back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uprising .\nBut Haggerty took it further by using his lyrics to address social issues .\nOne notable example is \u201c Waltzing Will Trilogy \u201d off the 1973 self-titled album .\nHaggerty directly calls out the \u201c pack of straight white honky quacks \u201d who administer shock treatment to homosexuals ( \u201c they call it mental hygiene but I call it psychic rape \u201d ) .\nThe tune also addresses how young gay men were beaten to death by police and sodomized by prison guards .\nIn the liner notes to Strong Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists , musician Richard Dworkin wrote : \u201c One could argue that Patrick Haggerty \u2026 was as in-your-face shocking and transgressive as anything the [ 70s ] would produce\u2014up to and including the Sex Pistols and Dead Kennedys .\n\u201d", "author": "CJ

Freedom For Native American Activist Hundreds of supporters of incarcerated Native American rights activist Leonard Peltier rallied at the nation \u2019 s capital on Sunday to demand President Joe Biden grant clemency to the long-held prisoner .\n\u201c He \u2019 s 78-years-old , he has type 2 diabetes and an abdominal aortic aneurysm that \u2019 s fatal if it ruptures .\nHe had a stroke where he lost 80 percent of the vision in one of his eyes , \u201d Rachel Thunder , one of the organizers for the rally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending the remainder of his life with his family , not locked up in a cage.\n\u201d Thunder was one of many Peltier supporters who walked across the country to raise awareness of his incarceration as part of a national \u2018 Walk To Justice \u2019 that began earlier this year .\nThe march started on September 1 in Minneapolis , Minnesota and took nearly three months to complete .\nParticipants covered over 1,100 miles before arriving at their final destination of Washington , D.C on November 13 .\nThis public spectacle by Peltier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development in an half century-long international campaign advocating for his release .\nNelson Mandela , The Dalai Lama , Pope Francis , Desmond Tutu , and Mother Teresa are among the figures who have petitioned for Peltier \u2019 s freedom throughout his 47 years of imprisonment .\nThe high-profile prisoner was originally convicted in 1977 for the murder of two FBI agents after a shootout on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota .\nPeltier was , at the time , a member of the American Indian Movement .\nThe organization was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil rights group and subsequently became famous for their high profile political protests in the 1970s , such as their occupations of Alcatraz Island in 1969 and the Bureau of Indian Affairs headquarters in 1971 .\nPeltier was invited to the Pine Ridge Reservation by locals who claimed that a corrupt tribal official named Dick Wilson and his cronies were responsible for the unsolved deaths of several dozen political opponents .\nWilson had allegedly operated a private militia , known as the Guardians of the Oglala Nation ( GOONs ) , to terrorize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration .\nWilson was unpopular among many in the tribe after becoming chairman in 1972 .\nSoon after , his most vocal critics found themselves targeted with violence .\nThose who spoke out against Wilson found their homes shot up in drive-by shootings or set on fire in the dead of night .\nThis string of violent incidents left over 60 dead with all of the killings labeled as unsolved .\nFinally , when a team of white lawyers came to the reservation to investigate the attacks , their plane was riddled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Wilson and his men .\nPeltier was hoping to counter the violence and oust Wilson by organizing local residents on the reservation .\nOn June 26 , 1975 while driving to the home where he and other AIM activists had been staying , he found himself pursued by two unmarked cars .\nThe cars belonged to FBI Special Agents Ronald Williams and Jack Coler , who began following Peltier while attempting to locate a man named Jimmy Eagle who had allegedly stolen a pair of boots .\nDespite Peltier having no connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the main road of town onto private property until he stopped in the middle of his driveway and exited his car to confront them .\nPeltier alleges the agents began shooting at him the moment they saw he was armed , and never identified themselves as law enforcement .\nPeltier returned fire and two AIM members , Robert Robideau and Darrelle Butler , rushed from the home and opened fire on the agents from the ridge top , mortally wounding them .\nBoth Robideau and Butler were acquitted of murder after arguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peltier , whose gunfire had never actually struck the agents , was tried separately .\nOnce the trial began , a number of witnesses came forward to testify against him .\nTheir testimonies made up the bulk of the prosecution \u2019 s case , alleging Peltier had confessed to the murders while others who testified claimed to have witnessed the murders themselves .\nPeltier \u2019 s supporters point out that witness testimony contradicts the ballistic evidence , and that a number of witnesses who testified against Peltier have since recanted their statements .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ testified for the prosecution now publicly say that they were coerced by the FBI , and in some cases had never actually met Peltier or even knew who he was before testifying against him .\nOne witness even admitted during trial that she was paid $ 42,000 by the FBI in exchange for her cooperation on the case .\n\u201c I looked at this [ case ] as a member of the federal judiciary and what happened was clear to me , \u201d Kevin Sharp\u2014a former federal judge that came to lead Peltier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The constitutional violations that occurred to convict this man were clear to me .\nThe violations were so open and obvious but , wasn \u2019 t clear to me was the why , \u201d he said .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve spent the last few years slowly uncovering that.\n\u201d Former U.S. Attorney James Reynolds , whose office originally prosecuted Peltier , also spoke at the rally , sharing similar statements while calling for the activist \u2019 s sentence to be commuted .\n\u201c Years ago , I wrote a letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for clemency , and I did that because I thought it was my duty in the name of justice\u2014because justice in this case is clemency for Leonard.\n\u201d Reynolds explained during the rally .\nClimate lawyer Steve Donziger , who last year was sentenced to 6 months in prison for contempt of court in a case which , like Peltier \u2019 s , has earned him the title of political prisoner , also spoke in favor of clemency .\n\u201c What \u2019 s happening to Leonard in my view , yes it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppression but it \u2019 s also really really weak.\n\u201d Donziger told the crowd .\n\u201c When a person has a message that \u2019 s so threatening to these entrenched interests of power , they will mobilize the judicial system and other levers of governmental power to try and silence that person , and weaponize that person to scare everyone else who will do work on that kind of level.\n\u201d While many advocates called for Peltier \u2019 s release on the grounds of his innocence , members of his family are demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c I \u2019 ve only known my father through stories , \u201d Kathy Peltier said of her father .\n\u201c Everyone would tell me what a funny guy he was .\nI never saw that .\nThe only time I ever saw him he was always serious and it was when I was visiting him in jail.\n\u201d President Joe Biden \u2019 s administration is the fifth to face pressure from Peltier supporters petitioning for his release .\nDuring previous clemency talks during the Clinton Administration , 500 FBI Agents picketed the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law enforcement to demand that Peltier stay in jail .\nHis supporters hope they can mount more pressure on the administration than their opponents this time around .\nOrganizers say they will stay in Washington , D.C to meet with government officials over the next few days regarding the possibility of President Biden granting clemency on compassionate grounds .\nSo far , 11 members of Congress have signed an open letter to the administration asking for Peltier to be released .", "author": "Sam Bishop", "url":

Privacy Of Assange Visitors This article was funded by paid subscribers of The Dissenter Newsletter .\nBecome a monthly paid subscriber to help us continue our independent journalism .\nIn August , a lawsuit against the CIA , former CIA director Mike Pompeo , UC Global , and UC Global director David Morales was filed that alleged Americans who visited WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange when he was living in the Ecuador embassy had their privacy rights violated .\nAttorney Richard Roth filed a complaint on behalf of two attorneys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two journalists , Charles Glass and John Goetz .\nThey say they were spied upon by the CIA-backed operation when they met with Assange .\nThe lawsuit will be deliberated over in a United States court in the Southern District of New York .\nIt was assigned to Judge John Koeltl .\nKevin Gosztola recently spoke with Richard about the status of the lawsuit and what happens next .\nGOSZTOLA : What is the status of the case ?\nROTH : The current status is we have filed a complaint , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for good reason ) .\nAnd we are in the process of serving the summons and complaint .\nWe served it on Mike Pompeo .\nWe served it on the CIA , which is the United States \u2019 Attorney \u2019 s Office which represents the CIA .\nAnd we are in the middle of serving it on two Spanish\u2014one entity and one individual\u2014but the two defendants who live in Spain .\nOnce we do that , we have a conference schedule .\nI think it \u2019 s January 17 , and we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trial of this case .\nGOSZTOLA : I know one of the issues for this case when you are proving that people \u2019 s rights were systematically violated .\nParticularly , when you are involving the Central Intelligence Agency , you have to have standing .\nIf you went into court tomorrow and you had to prove to the judge you had standing , what would you say to the judge ?\nROTH : So great question .\nI like how you artfully asked it .\nThe bottom line is that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say we have four US individuals , all of whom were on embassy soil .\nThat is diplomacy soil .\nAnd each of them are protected by the Fourth Amendment .\nThe Fourth Amendment provides protection from any search and seizure\u2014whether you \u2019 re in the US or whether you \u2019 re in Bangladesh\u2014for any US citizen .\nHere they happen to have been in London at the Ecuador embassy , and they because they \u2019 re US citizens have that right to not be violated , not be invaded by the CIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a process , Your Honor , and the process essentially requires the CIA , or whoever it may be that wants to tape record conversations , to go and get a search warrant .\nThey have to show probable cause .\nThey have to go before a judge .\nThey have to get an order .\nOnly upon those events can they go and actually listen in on conversations or copy conversations .\nWithout that , it gives us standing , and it \u2019 s a violation of the Fourth Amendment .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover all the bases , up to this point are there any responses from the lawyers or attorneys that will be representing the CIA ?\nI know you issued a complaint to Mike Pompeo in his private capacity .\nHave you received any response ?\nROTH : We have not .\nThey have been radio silent .\nOne thing we know , which gives us tremendous confidence , is that there \u2019 s a lawsuit pending in Spain , and El Pa\u00eds , which is the largest newspaper reports on it frequently .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of information from that Spanish lawsuit .\nSo we \u2019 re very comfortable in our position .\nWe believe that we can prove what we need to prove , but to date , nobody has given a response .\nGOSZTOLA : Part of the lawsuit that you have filed is enabled by some of that journalism that has been done , as you \u2019 re saying .\nWe have El Pa\u00eds who has investigated .\nWe have the Yahoo !\nNews from September 2021 that laid out some details ; actually made Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of evidence that you \u2019 re bringing into court , a lot of it \u2019 s public now .\nBut by bringing this lawsuit , you believe that there will be an opportunity for a discovery phase in order to investigate and uncover even more detail on the violations of people \u2019 s privacy rights .\nROTH : We believe there \u2019 s a tremendous amount of discovery .\nWe believe that there are hundreds of communications by and between the defendants , which went into the New York and Washington offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe believe we \u2019 re entitled to all those communications .\nWe believe we \u2019 re also entitled to what they actually imaged .\nRemember , the allegations are that when you went to the embassy , you gave the embassy personnel every computer device you had , whether it be a phone , an iPad , a laptop .\nAnd they imaged everything while you were meeting Assange .\nSo , we will be able to get a tremendous amount of information , and we are looking forward to the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nGOSZTOLA : You believe that this could have potentially affected over a thousand of people from the US , who you could consider US persons in one way or another .\nPut that in perspective .\nIn terms of a case involving people \u2019 s privacy rights , what does that really mean ?\nWhat does that number mean ?\nROTH : The number is for anyone that visited embassy .\nRemember , Julian Assange was in there for seven years .\nHe had friends .\nHe had family .\nHe had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had people that he worked with visited him , and he had lawyers visit him .\nSo that number is not all US citizens , meaning they can \u2019 t all be plaintiffs , but people have come forward since the filing of the complaint saying hey , I \u2019 m a US citizen .\nI want to be a plaintiff .\nIt means a lot because not only did the CIA violate the Fourth Amendment by wrongfully taking information of everyone , but there \u2019 s a lot of other things they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney has attorney-client privilege .\nIf I represented you , any communications we would have either oral or in writing are privileged .\nBy going in and listening to the conversations between Assange and either Ms. Hrbek or Ms. Kunstler , the CIA essentially violated the sanctity of attorney-client privilege .\nNot only that , but if they went in and imaged , as we alleged , the computers of these lawyers , then they have attorney-client privileged information of the lawyers , which doesn \u2019 t even relate to Assange .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client , to her client in her computer , and the CIA actually imaged it .\nThen they have additional information , which has nothing to do with Assange .\nAdd to that [ Assange ] saw doctors so they have doctor-patient information .\nSo there \u2019 s a lot of information that we think they have , all illegally , which we want .\nGOSZTOLA : Then , of course , there \u2019 s the two journalists .\nYou \u2019 ve got Charles Glass and John Goetz , and those two individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ norms that are accepted within the society in the United States\u2014is that you should not be explicitly targeting those individuals .\nAnd I suppose it \u2019 s worth pointing out while this lawsuit is unfolding that it \u2019 s now been codified by the Justice Department that they are not supposed to target journalists .\nThat is to allow them to become collateral damage in prosecutions , whether those involve leaks or other criminal investigations .\nSo there could not be a justification for targeting your two journalist clients .\nI suppose they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the justification if they think they were spying on them in the context of a criminal investigation .\nBut by and large , we accept those people are entitled to their privacy .\nROTH : Absolutely .\nSo we have journalists that went in and interviewed Assange , and they went in and the CIA went and took that .\nCan you imagine what that does to investigative journalism , if an investigative journalist that he \u2019 s being tape recorded by the CIA ?\nAnd on top of that even , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit Julian Assange .\nThere \u2019 s a doctor-patient privilege , which he has .\nIf he is going to see a doctor for an ailment or illness , why in god \u2019 s name would the CIA be entitled to that information ?\nYes , the journalists , the doctors , the lawyers .\nIt \u2019 s just really , really inappropriate .\nAnd it \u2019 s overreaching , and the irony is that the US has indicted Julian Assange for essentially wrongfully disclosing information .\nIn the meantime , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than Assange because they are wrongfully taking information .\nSo , yeah , it \u2019 s interesting how what \u2019 s good for the goose as they say is not necessarily good for the gander .\nGOSZTOLA : You mention there are people who have come to you who say they \u2019 ve been spied on too .\nIs there any likelihood that this gets certified as some kind of a class action because there are a number of people who have been targeted allegedly ?\nROTH : There are people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them we exclude because they are not US citizens .\nTomorrow I \u2019 m meeting with somebody else .\nThere is a chance that it goes to a class action lawsuit , although the goal is not to complicate the litigation .\nClass action lawsuits by definition complicates it because you got to certify the class , and there \u2019 s motions over that .\nOur goal here really is to essentially seek grievance for the four people who did come to us , and say listen , you just can \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our only clients are these four , but there \u2019 s a likelihood it will expand .\nGOSZTOLA : It \u2019 s worth pointing out that what you \u2019 re doing is a valuable check on the power of the executive branch when in fact what we \u2019 ve seen is an incredible lack of interest and action on the part of the legislative branch in order to investigate .\nWhich is to say that we know that the House intelligence committee , or the Senate intelligence committee , could find that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this activity against a diplomatic outpost or an embassy .\nI can \u2019 t imagine what would happen if we found out that a country was targeting explicitly [ a United States ] embassy while they were hosting somebody who was an asylum seeker , say a rival power was targeting people as they came in and out , and they investigated those visitors .\nThat they violated their privacy .\nWe know the outrage that we would hear from the US State Department , and yet there hasn \u2019 t been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to this issue .\nYour lawsuit is very important I think for forcing that out into the open .\nBecause even if for some reason the CIA is able to stifle this lawsuit\u2014or Pompeo is able to stifle your lawsuit , you \u2019 ve at least made this a public issue .\nROTH : That \u2019 s correct .\nAnd let \u2019 s not forget , not only did they go in and image each of the plaintiffs \u2019 computers , laptops , and phones while they left it with security .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ audio and video recording devices , in the conference room where they met Assange .\nSo they have everything , and what we learn in the Spanish case , these individuals that worked for UC Global essentially were asking their bosses , why am I tape recording and sending these tapes back to Washington ?\nI don \u2019 t understand what Washington had to do with it .\nThere were individuals who were employees of this company that were stuck in the middle .\nThey wanted to keep their job , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julian Assange would go to the CIA .\nSo , we have some very , very damning information against the CIA and Pompeo , and we intend on pursuing it .\nGOSZTOLA : One of the final questions I have for you is to point out that , yes , people might be cynical .\nIf they are following this Assange case closely and if they are following things related to this spying operation , they might have seen that the Spanish court has had some significant difficulties when it comes to getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get compliance .\nI know they want to know the IP addresses , who was making those connections , where were those computers , what were those computers that were receiving this data .\nBut why don \u2019 t you take a moment just to point out what you \u2019 ll be able to do as somebody who is a US lawyer and in a US court in order to force the discovery of this information .\nIt won \u2019 t be as easy to not comply and deny you information that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nROTH : That \u2019 s absolutely right .\nWhat we \u2019 ve learned from the Trump era , four years , is that they are masterful at avoiding processes .\nThey have avoided everything that the Spanish court has sought , even by subpoena .\nWe know what they did with the January 6th committee , where they wouldn \u2019 t produce documents and testify .\nWe know what happened with the impeachment proceedings and the entire presidential organization .\nSo , they essentially are very good at either stonewalling or refusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax documents were ordered to be produced , Trump appealed that again .\nTo your point , [ the Spanish court does ] not have the federal authority of a federal court judge .\nA federal court judge was appointed to the case , a guy by the name of Judge Koeltl .\nAs is true of all federal court judges , he was appointed by the President of the United States .\nThey have tremendous power .\nThey can compel Mike Pompeo and the CIA to produce documents .\nIf they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held in contempt of court and could go to jail .\nWhen you have federal court judge , someone you don \u2019 t mess with , whoever it may be , you can \u2019 t play the games that they played in Spain with the Spanish court .\nThey played with the January 6th committee .\nThey played with other organizations .\nThis is the judge , and the judge is going to say to them I want you to produce it and I want you to produce it now .\nThat \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than any other dispute before another foreign organization .\nGOSZTOLA : It \u2019 s important to mention that Judge Koeltl already had a case before him that involved WikiLeaks and already came down on the side of protecting freedom of the press when the Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez tried to lump WikiLeaks with alleged Russian agents and with the Trump campaign , when it came to their alleged examples of interference in the 2016 election .\nHe said no , if you obtain hacked materials , which is what WikiLeaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to publish just as anybody in the United States does under the First Amendment .\nYou must feel pretty good knowing that you \u2019 ve got somebody who is going to preside over this case , who has a history with WikiLeaks and isn \u2019 t going to see just see that this involves Julian Assange and have some kind of irrational response to your efforts .\nROTH : I think we are very fortunate to get Judge Koeltl , not necessarily because of that prior decision but because of his experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHe worked at a major law firm .\nHe was involved with the Watergate prosecution team .\nHe was appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1994 .\nSo , he \u2019 s been at the federal court bench almost thirty years .\nYou don \u2019 t say no to a federal court judge that \u2019 s been there for a year .\nHe \u2019 s been there for twenty-eight , I believe .\nCertainly , it \u2019 s a really great force that we have , and if the federal government wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koeltl will definitely be on our side .\nListen , he \u2019 s very unbiased .\nHe very professional .\nHe \u2019 s unbelievably experienced .\nNothing is going to slip past him .\nSo , we \u2019 re lucky we have a judge with such experience and stamina .\nGOSZTOLA : The last thing I \u2019 ll ask , I think we have to make clear that you \u2019 re not on Julian Assange \u2019 s legal team .\nYou \u2019 re representing these people that are coming before court or will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their privacy rights were violated and present the evidence as best possible .\nBut that extradition case and the potential for Julian Assange to be put on trial in the United States is going to be a backdrop and could potentially be happening at the same time that this moves through the court .\nIs there anything that you want to say about this dynamic and what it means for your lawsuit ?\nROTH : You hit it on the head .\nThere \u2019 s not much more to say except that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in Assange \u2019 s conference room , listening in on conversations that he had with his lawyer for that case\u2014Remember , years ago he brought a very experienced DC lawyer to help him defend against this indictment , which was released three years ago , but it was sealed initially .\nCould you imagine if the CIA , the government prosecuting Assange already has conversations between Assange and his lawyer ?\nAnd even documents ?\nSo , there really is a stink to it .\nIn the other case , we don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , but I have even as a lawyer and American , I have a problem with the government going in and actually taking information against if you will its adversary in that case .\nWe \u2019 ll see how it plays out .\nI \u2019 m not sure what \u2019 s going to happen .\nHe \u2019 s probably going to be extradited .\nHe \u2019 ll probably be tried in Virginia .\nIt is a very complicated case .\nIt \u2019 s a difficult case .\nThe First Amendment cries out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see what happens in that case , and this is somewhat intertwined to the extent that the government , his adversary , went and took information from him\u2014which is a subject matter of this case\u2014for that case .\nGOSZTOLA : It \u2019 s kind of intertwined because your lawsuit is going to hopefully succeed in proving even more than we already know .\nThat the CIA was connected to this private security company .\nI think it \u2019 s like a half dozen or so people .\nIt \u2019 s a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security for the Ecuador embassy .\nBut hopefully we \u2019 ll be able to actually , truly through your lawsuit connect that , and then I imagine even though that \u2019 s not the goal of your lawsuit immediately , it might open some doors for the Assange defense because they \u2019 ll be able to introduce that into their evidence .\nIn fact , I imagine the cases move in the same way that the extradition proceedings have in some ways been affected and influenced periodically by what \u2019 s happening in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate these issues .\nLike you \u2019 re saying , if the CIA is targeting the person who the US is trying to prosecute , it \u2019 s hard to believe that you could get fair justice .\nROTH : That \u2019 s exactly right .\nAnd we will see how this plays out .\nThey \u2019 re very important cases , both of them , in our country .\nThey have tremendous significance .\nListen , we all believe in the CIA and its powers , and we believe it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on in Ukraine and Russia , to know what \u2019 s going on in the Middle East .\nBut every federal government , every organization , every branch of government has to stay within its boundaries .\nAnd our lawsuit really tests those boundaries to see whether or not the government , the CIA in particular and Mike Pompeo , are really going way over the line .\nGOSZTOLA : You mentioned that your judge was involved in the Watergate prosecution , and it seems like we \u2019 re looking at similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s not unheard of .\nAmericans are pretty familiar with the periods in history when their government agencies acted

published at Ongoing History of Protest Music Music is often an outlet for songwriters to express their political and personal frustrations .\nThat was the case with the New Orleans singer-songwriter Earnest Jackson , who in 1975 composed the song \u201c Inflation \u201d in response to being adversely affected by the high cost of living .\nJackson collaborated with the instrumental funk band Sugar Daddy and the Gumbo Roux , to record the topical tune .\nBut it remained unreleased until recently .\nThe group \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NPR \u2019 s \u201c Planet Money.\n\u201d He was in possession of a demo cassette of the song , and due to the renewed timeliness of the subject matter , he reached out to inquire if \u201c Planet Money \u201d could feature the tune .\n\u201c Planet Money \u201d ended up forming a record label for the sole purpose of distributing the song and giving it the long-overdue exposure that it deserves .\nJackson sings , \u201c Inflation is in the nation , and it \u2019 s about to put us all away.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks are now being crushed by low wages and rising prices .\nThis 47-year-old ditty is the perfect anthem for our current times .\nSeveral members of

Support Prison Abolition This article was originally published as part of the Dissenter Newsletter .\nBecome a monthly paid subscriber to help us continue our independent journalism .\nReality Winner is an NSA whistleblower who was harshly prosecuted under the Espionage Act , but she is also more than that .\nShe is an advocate who has used the visibility gained from her case to promote an end to prisons in the United States .\nI covered Reality \u2019 s detention and incarceration as a whistleblower extensively .\nWhat she endured further solidified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet according to Winner , she questioned the existence of the US prison system before she was arrested in June 2017 .\nThis is the first time that I have spoken to Reality since she was transferred to Federal Medical Center Carswell in 2018 .\nWe discuss her incarceration during the COVID pandemic , rampant sexual abuse in Bureau of Prisons facilities , and why prison is one of the worst places for a person struggling with drug addiction or substance abuse problems .\nSome of what Reality shares in the interview was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , her stories from prison are much more detailed than what was described in earlier reports .\n*Below is a transcript of the interview with NSA whistleblower Reality Winner , with minor edits to improve clarity .\nGOSZTOLA : I \u2019 ve been following your commentary and how you follow issues in the US prison system , and I was really drawn to how your outspoken .\nYou say , America \u2019 s incapable of a humane system detention .\nJust as there \u2019 s no humane form of slavery .\nAbolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a lot like asking for slavery reform .\nAnd you \u2019 ve been outspoken about abolishing prisons , and I was hoping to talk with you today about how you came to that view and if you could share some of what you experienced while you were incarcerated that maybe led to this awakening .\nWINNER : Ironically enough , this realization actually started a month before my incarceration .\nI had watched the Netflix documentary \u201c The 13th , \u201d and leading up to the night I found myself in jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my family had ever heard about from me .\nI was like , you need to watch this .\nMy sister watched it .\nWe had many conversations about it .\nFor me , the first time I was indirectly or in the vicinity of a police killing was when I lived on the outskirts of Baltimore in 2014 , when Freddie Gray was basically murdered .\nOr he died in police custody , but the negligence just made it a homicide .\nI remember I was working my mission in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curfew .\nAnd so , it was kind of surreal .\nWithout going into my career as a linguist too much , I was essentially sitting in a combat position watching our war in Afghanistan , and we had the local news and we had CNN on and they were doing a live countdown to when the curfew would be enforced .\nAnd there were still people on the street , and there was a line of police officers in their military gear .\nThat \u2019 s kind of the first time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same conflict that I had wanted to dedicate my life to in Afghanistan , was playing out 15 miles away from me on American streets , and that I in no way sympathized with the people in uniform .\nThat \u2019 s kind of where I had started in 2014 , to pay attention to police brutality and the over-militarization of the American police .\nThat \u2019 s where I started to understand it \u2019 s completely deregulated because it \u2019 s compartmentalized into different jurisdictions , and there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every police force is doing .\nIt was incredibly ironic that I found myself in an extremely negligent county jail and [ faced ] the sexual exploitation in the jail and the constant negligence of basic needs and watching women go through medical emergencies .\nI , myself , had a medical issue come up when I was in court .\nI fell while handcuffed and busted my face open and also had a contusion in my knee .\nAnd it resulted in a giant bubble that a month later was drained at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really questionable .\nI mean , I \u2019 m glad he drained it because that bubble was huge and weird ; but the fact that I waited a month for that , and it was a clearly visible thing that was going on .\nI was limping .\nThe transfer process\u2014They told me , oh , it \u2019 s diesel therapy .\nIt \u2019 s dehumanizing , but the conditions steadily got worse .\nNever say you \u2019 ve hit rock bottom because that floor can always break open and expose new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said I \u2019 ve been through the worst .\nI \u2019 m good .\nThen Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd , and we got put on lockdown for it .\nTheir excuse was the BOP sent their riot task force to the streets to police civilians .\nAnd the BOP is not a police force .\nIn no system should that have ever happened .\nWe did not draw soldiers from Afghanistan to police Dallas , Texas .\nWhy are we sending BOP guards to police civilians ?\nThe only thing that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us .\nWe had little to no contact with our family , and it was a direct retaliation on the communities that were hurting the most from the murder .\nThat \u2019 s how the system works .\nYou always have to look at , what is the overall message to the American people when 80,000 inmates go quiet ?\nIt \u2019 s a direct message to those communities to stop rioting .\nIt \u2019 s a direct message that police can murder people , and you are all going to be put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt was demoralizing .\nIt was about as bad a month later when we all had COVID , and we were blamed for it , even though none of the safety precautions that were given to us did any good .\nMy unit had a 90 percent infection rate , and all they did was continue to shuffle us around .\nThey locked us down so we could be quarantined from one unit to another .\nBut the day we got sick there were inmates that were too sick to move , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another unit .\nThere was no consideration for the fact that people were actively ill with a virus that in July 2020 nobody actively knew what this body does to the body .\nThat \u2019 s how soon it was .\nThat \u2019 s how early it was in the pandemic .\nLong COVID was not a household word at that time .\nYou have inmates who are catching COVID over and over again , their civil rights and civil liberties being violated over and over again in the name of safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do get sick nothing is done for them .\nThere \u2019 s no medical care .\nGOSZTOLA : COVID is still an issue for prisoners .\nIt wasn \u2019 t long ago that you put this out where you let people know , \u201c Meanwhile , US federal and state prisons still have ZERO idea how to handle COVID without cruel and unusual lockdowns , which usually mean inmates deprived of fresh food & air , visitation , programs\u2026All while waiting to be infected , the 4th or 5th time , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connecting this back to your experiences , when you were released in the middle of 2021\u2014just to give people some perspective\u2014what was it like when you were leaving , despite the fact that we had elected Joe Biden and there was some movement when it came to dealing with the pandemic that was much better than Trump ?\nAnd despite having vaccines available , how behind was the Bureau of Prisons ?\nWINNER : There was no change .\nThat was kind of the biggest crush .\nFrom January 2021 to the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLittle to no lifting of the lockdowns .\nI was still using my job as an excuse and my good standing with certain officers to get outside as much as possible .\nWe had caught COVID in July 2020 and December 2020 .\nSo we actually had it twice in a six-month period .\nGoing into April 2021 , one day nurses came into the unit and started setting up stations .\nThey said we \u2019 re giving out the first dose .\nGet in line or pack your shit .\nPeople @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going ?\nThere \u2019 s different units .\nWe were in 2 North .\nPeople were asking if we were going downstairs to 1 North if we didn \u2019 t get vaccinated .\nAnd they said you \u2019 re not going to like where you \u2019 re going .\nGet the vaccine or pack your shit .\nThere was no conversation with your doctor about which version of the COVID vaccine is right for you .\nThere was no discussion of the certain ingredients that certain individuals are allergic to .\nIt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at that time to saying if any of y \u2019 all are trying to go to halfway houses just know they \u2019 re not accepting you If you \u2019 re not vaccinated , which was not true .\nBut basically that was when I was like , okay , I \u2019 m getting released in a month to a halfway house .\nI need this vaccine .\nI need record of this vaccine .\nSo I got in line .\nObviously , it was the Pfizer vaccine because we got vaccinated twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second dose .\nThat \u2019 s how we knew which version of the shot we got .\nSo I got my two doses , and even though I had caught COVID twice and being vaccinated , 23 days before my release I had to go into a hospital room .\nCarswell was built in a old military hospital .\nSo when I say hospital room , I mean the main building of the prison is the old hospital .\nWe eat in the old prison cafeteria .\nSo the quarantine rooms\u2014you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital room built for two beds , and it had two little bathrooms on each side up by the front door .\nThere were nine of us in that room for 23 days straight .\nAnd you [ didn \u2019 t ] leave that room for anything ever .\nIt was like you \u2019 re about to go home , and time stands still .\nThere \u2019 s like ten different rooms like that\u2014either people on one side of the hall are coming to the prison or people on our side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms of women demanding to use the phone .\nYou have ten rooms of women demanding ice for drinking water .\nAnd you have one officer doing that for ten rooms for 12 hours at a time .\nI have compassion so I understand it was a lot , but it was also a lot of disrespect .\nI know that there were times when I demanded a lieutenant .\nI knew the lieutenant that was working that day , and that \u2019 s why I demanded a lieutenant that day .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the meanest the lieutenant , opens the door , says , \u201c I got your lieutenant , \u201d and in walks the fiercest lieutenant ever .\nI was like , I \u2019 m going home .\nI \u2019 m not going to lose face .\nI jump down , and go have a conversation with that lieutenant .\nThat officer was just mad that I was even willing to be direct with that lieutenant .\nThey thought I was going to be scared .\nWe didn \u2019 t even get really anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us for three days on the phone .\nSo imagine you \u2019 re trying to make plans with your family .\nPick me up at this time on this day , and then you go quiet for three days straight .\nThat \u2019 s not good .\nYou can \u2019 t do that to us .\nIt was just a horrible situation .\nThe first three days I only got a breakfast tray because even though I had a legal right to a non-flesh or a vegetarian tray the way it is they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen .\nIf they didn \u2019 t put a vegetarian tray on the cart , I didn \u2019 t eat that meal .\nWhat you could carry was in that room with you .\nSo it wasn \u2019 t like I packed a bunch of commissary because I thought they were going to feed me .\nEvery now and then an officer who knew me would call the kitchen and get a tray sent up .\nBut it was three days at least until they actually regularly sent up meals for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were doing after we were vaccinated .\nThat \u2019 s the kind of authoritarianism , the kind of blatant abuse , the kind of neglect .\nAnd once I got to the halfway house , they said you need to be quarantined again because we don \u2019 t know if you \u2019 re vaccinated .\nI said okay , well , can I call the prison tomorrow and have them fax my vaccine [ record ] ?\nBecause once you \u2019 re vaccinated in the halfway house , you don \u2019 t go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with everybody else .\nYou \u2019 re quarantined .\nYou don \u2019 t get to go use the phone in the hallway because you \u2019 re quarantined .\nI actually to this day have not seen that original vaccine record .\nI couldn \u2019 t get it from the prison .\nThe halfway house , which is part of the Bureau of Prisons , could not get Federal Medical Center Carswell to send my vaccine record to them .\nMy attorney could not get it .\nMy family physician could not get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional office on this .\nFederal Medical Center Carswell is not giving out those records of vaccines given to me .\nSo I don \u2019 t know what I got , but I had to be quarantined twice for it .\nOnce I was released from the halfway house and had my ankle monitor cut off\u2014you know , I didn \u2019 t know how Texas was going to be about it .\nObviously , Texas we \u2019 re super chill , pretending like COVID doesn \u2019 t exist .\nBut in most states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to apply for a job .\nSo I went out and immediately got the Johnson & Johnson one-and-done , however , because that was within six months of my last dose , I was laid out for three days with some of the worst pain ever .\nBut I was willing to do that because Carswell refused to give me a vaccine card for a vaccine they forced me to get in the first place .\nI \u2019 ve had one of the worst COVID experiences\u2014not so much COVID itself , the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled keeping people safe from a virus and keeping people vaccinated .\nOr giving people the option to vaccinate .\nGOSZTOLA : While you were in the facility , they \u2019 re choosing to lock down people , but you all can see the guards and people who work at the facility coming out during this pandemic .\nAre you and your fellow prisoners aware that COVID could be coming in and out of the prison ?\nAre you seeing sick people ?\nAre you seeing that , oh , that guard is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this other person they \u2019 re sick now ?\nWINNER : Right , so when the state of Texas first shut down , officers were talking about certain officers who turned their backyards into bars for their street , for their neighborhood .\nAs federal employees , they never quarantined themselves before coming into work or not .\nWhen we had COVID , they actually setup tents outside for the kitchen workers so that the kitchens wouldn \u2019 t shut down .\nI watched an officer do 12 hours on our unit while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tent after work .\nWe watched our officers get sick , and they had COVID with us .\nEven though they were supposed to sign , every morning they came into work .\nThey would get their temperature checked .\nI \u2019 m not symptomatic today .\nThey were lying to come in because they thought they were going to get hazard pay .\nEverybody was going after that hazard pay , the bonus money , the overtime because of the lockdown and having less staff .\nThe same way we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure we stayed in our unit , where we felt safe , they were lying to come in to make extra money to keep their paycheck .\nSo they all got sick with us .\nI was already symptomatic , already coming back down , already feeling better .\nThat was when they told me I \u2019 m not negative .\nSo , originally , after they tested all of us on a Wednesday , that Sunday they pulled out\u2014out of a unit of 170 women\u2014they pulled out 15 of us that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we \u2019 re going to put you guys in a COVID negative unit .\nWe \u2019 re going to test you again however .\nAnd then , six of us , including me , were called aside again from that group .\nSo we sat in a room of people that were allegedly COVID negative .\nFor fifteen minutes , we hadn \u2019 t seen these people in months .\nEveryone \u2019 s looking at the officers and running over and hugging people .\nThen they called us aside after we \u2019 ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I don \u2019 t know why y \u2019 all are here .\nY \u2019 all aren \u2019 t negative .\nSo no one was giving us a piece of paper with our test results with positive or negative .\nThey just told us six y \u2019 all aren \u2019 t negative for COVID .\nGo back to your unit .\nWe carried all of our stuff back up to the unit .\nNobody knows what \u2019 s going on , and there was the officer that didn \u2019 t like me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And everybody is like , Winner , what happened ?\nI \u2019 m like , we \u2019 re the COVID unit .\nWe got COVID , like just making a joke of it .\nBecause at that point everybody was sick .\nWe knew it .\nEverybody started clapping .\nYeah , Winner \u2019 s back .\nI went back up into my room because I had to pack up everything again , and this officer comes .\nWe had plastic curtains .\nIt \u2019 s an airborne virus , and so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same air into the rooms .\nBut they gave us plastic curtains in the middle of summer that made the room hot as hell , and it was a disciplinary shot if we pulled those curtains aside to get air .\nThat officer came into the curtain after it was revealed that I had COVID , pulled down her mask , and said , oh , Winner , I just want to congratulate you for your positive test results .\nSo you can tell how hard they were trying to not get COVID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt was never about spreading a contagious disease .\nIt was always about discipline .\nThey had different masks than us .\nWe couldn \u2019 t talk to our family as much .\nWe couldn \u2019 t leave our room .\nWe showered when they told us to shower .\nThey handed us our food .\nIt was all about breaking down and removing what freedoms we did have .\nAnd once they started lifting the lockdowns\u2014they actually lifted the lockdowns and the quarantine for the prisons .\nWe didn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the staff had left or quit during COVID .\nSo they actually didn \u2019 t have the staff or resources to go right back to the same programs they offered pre-COVID .\nSo Federal Medical Center Carswell is still operating at 70 percent of the programs , of the resources for inmates that they were just before 2019\u2014for no reason , other than sheer incompetency .\nThey got used to having everybody locked down , and I fear that that \u2019 s going to be the new BOP standard of operations .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news because of a US Senate subcommittee report that I imagine was daily life for you and other prisoners at Carswell is the rampant sexual abuse that goes on in Bureau of Prisons facilities .\nWe now have Senate staff spending many months to document the way in which this is basically just a feature of being incarcerated .\nNineteen out of 29 facilities they found in the last ten years have had some employee accused or found guilty of crimes when it comes to sexual abuse .\nI was hoping you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while you were at Carswell , as far as how you and all your fellow prisoners knew this was something you had to contend with as incarcerated individuals .\nWINNER : It \u2019 s definitely known , and at Carswell , it wasn \u2019 t hidden very well .\nThere was a certain lieutenant who was charged .\nHe hasn \u2019 t been sentenced yet , but Lt. Luis Curiel actually got a woman pregnant .\nWhen I heard the initials of the victim , I said , oh , that wasn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another little favorite .\nAnd they would just go on walks together , and she had a special prison assignment of cleaning his office when he was at work .\nEverybody knew it .\n[ Note : Curiel was sentenced September 21 .\nRemarkably , as Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported , he \u201c pleaded guilty to raping two women \u201d at Carswell and was sentenced to 18 months\u2014 \u201c half the amount of time one of his victims is serving for drug possession.\n\u201d ] So often it \u2019 s these lieutenants .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lieutenant \u2019 s office .\nMake it look like a disciplinary matter .\nThey \u2019 re really the only people who have the right to have complete one-on-one privacy with inmates but also not have staff who are in a place to complain about it .\nAs far as actual staff members committing assaults on the units with witnesses , there was one , and she touched me when I was in my bed for no reason .\nI reported it .\nSo there \u2019 s the Prison Rape Elimination Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posters everywhere you go in federal prisons .\nThey \u2019 re by the phones .\nThey \u2019 re by the phones .\nThey \u2019 re by the water fountains .\nThey \u2019 re on the walls randomly .\nThey \u2019 re by the computers .\nYou \u2019 ve got five different ways of reporting it .\nYou can do it by secure mail or you can do it on a phone call .\nOr you can do it on the computer system , and it goes straight to the DOJ IG .\nOkay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t know what happened I did that in March 2020 , and by December 2020 , that same officer was working our unit .\nShe was extremely abusive , like threatening violence on a regular night .\nFor me , it wasn \u2019 t a threat .\nIt was real because she put hands on me .\nShe had been removed from a unit just before that for actually taking off her belt and trying to wrestle an inmate .\nShe came from Texas state prisons , where they regularly physically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring that culture and make it normal in a federal prison .\nTelling us that we didn \u2019 t deserve this treatment simply because we were charged under the federal system , that we deserved to be degraded the way that Texas state inmates are degraded .\nAnd that was what she tried to normalize in every unit that she was working in .\nA woman came up to me after it was known that I had made a report against [ the officer ] and said she watches me when I shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the office to tell me about my body .\nShe was making very predatory remarks to us .\nIt got to the point where I couldn \u2019 t take it anymore .\nUnfortunately , it was that same lieutenant who knocked up a girl , who came to the unit to save us .\nBecause we were actually waving at the cameras to get somebody from control to send somebody .\nShe was going on a rant .\nWe were locked down .\nShe had us in our cells , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd it was Stockholm syndrome .\nShe was telling us , when y \u2019 all had COVID , who was the only officer that let y \u2019 all shower ?\nWho was the only officer that let y \u2019 all use the phone to talk to your families ?\nAnd most of us weren \u2019 t even in her unit .\nShe never came into our unit when we had COVID .\nYou weren \u2019 t that officer .\nEvery single officer who worked here gave us our basic rights .\nStop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s like , I \u2019 m the only person that cares about y \u2019 all getting out .\nIt \u2019 s psychological abuse .\nIt \u2019 s priming your victims to depend on you .\nThey should not be allowed to talk to us like that , and the lieutenant is just standing there watching this .\nPeople are gesturing to him , like please come talk to me .\nI need you to come talk to me , and he was just standing there .\nI lost it .\nI came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second floor and just screamed across the whole unit , and I said you need to look at the PREA reports against this officer .\nAnd she turned , and she was just like I don \u2019 t have any PREA reports against me .\nI said there \u2019 s three women on this unit that have reported you for sexual assault .\nYou do not need to be here .\nAnd I looked at the lieutenant again , and I said , where are the reports ?\nAnd she \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nShe \u2019 s just screaming insults .\nFinally , I looked at her and said you touched me .\nI filed a report , and I looked again at the lieutenant .\nWhere are the reports ?\nThat \u2019 s when the officer said , you keep lying , and I \u2019 m coming for your blood .\nRight after she said that , the lieutenant turned around and walked out of the unit , and we were left on our own with her until midnight .\nBasically , in short what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she started tearing up rooms , one at a time , all the way to midnight .\nJust tearing rooms apart one at a time .\nBecause as an inmate you \u2019 re not allowed to sleep .\nIf the officer doesn \u2019 t want you to sleep , you don \u2019 t have the right to sleep at night .\nAnd she starts at the room right next mine .\nShe looks at the clock .\nIt \u2019 s 11:55 .\nSteps out , looks at me , and says , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m starting over tomorrow night .\nThe next night was New Year \u2019 s Eve , but I had spent all day trying to get SIS , the Special Investigative Service , and then the staff investigative and the captain to come talk to me .\nOnly one person came and talked to me .\nI said this is what happened , and I would like to report a threat against my physical safety because she said she was coming for my blood .\nIronically enough , she actually didn \u2019 t work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually pulled from our unit .\nAnd later on , a staff member had told me of something that had happened within the prison .\nThe captain allegedly had pulled [ the officer ] from our unit , said you can \u2019 t work our unit after what happened .\nShe wasn \u2019 t working another unit .\nShe was actually put on leave while they were investigating .\nSo she had allegedly tried to call the captain on her work phone and leave a voicemail , but she left a voicemail on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different prison administrator .\nSo the officers were talking shit about it .\nThey don \u2019 t keep secrets either .\nOne [ officer ] had told me that she \u2019 s probably coming back to your unit because she thought she had left a voicemail on the captain \u2019 s phone saying , on a first-name basis , you know nothing happened .\nPlease let me come back to work .\nI \u2019 m just alone at home with the kids .\nThey \u2019 re driving me crazy .\nI don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me come back to work .\nSaying they \u2019 re obviously closer than anyone imagined , and you need to prepare yourself .\nCoincidentally enough , she did come back a lot more subdued .\nBut it was only for two nights and the second night happened to be January 6 [ in 2021 ] .\nShe tried to start some kind of riot or fight in our unit .\nAgain , it was sexually explicit .\nWe were on a COVID quarantine .\nWe had active COVID cases in our unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from different units who weren \u2019 t on COVID quarantine into our unit until she found the right inmate that went by the nickname that she was looking for .\nShe convinced two other officers to send their inmates to a COVID quarantine unit .\nAnd that inmate gets there and that inmate is not even properly dressed .\nShe \u2019 s in pajamas , and the officer said , hey , your girl \u2019 s in the shower with another inmate .\nAnd just let this inmate walk around our unit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that \u2019 s the case , they \u2019 re looking for a fight .\nThey \u2019 re looking for an altercation .\nWhen that didn \u2019 t happen , when she found her girlfriend in the TV room and went back and told the officer , the officer said , naw , she \u2019 s lying .\nHer knees are wet .\nI mean , the level of foulness that was going on here .\nWhen the other inmate found out what was happening , she went at the officer and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re doing this to me .\nThe moment she raised her voice this officer hit her body alarm , and there were six officers in our unit trying to figure out what \u2019 s going on .\nThose of us who were standing in the computer line , right in the vicinity of what happened\u2014we all raised our hands saying witness .\nYou must record us as witnesses as to what just happened .\nSo she was walked off our unit for the final time that night .\nIt took something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not the fact that I had said there \u2019 s sexual harassment and allegations against her , actively pending investigations in this unit .\nWhy was she working this unit ?\nBecause the BOP does not investigate their own .\nGOSZTOLA : You \u2019 re all given these hotlines you can call if you \u2019 ve got complaints .\nLike you \u2019 ve just said you can directly complain to the Justice Department \u2019 s inspector general .\nWhat \u2019 s the fear like ?\nHow many people are afraid because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also because officers might see they complained and they \u2019 ll face some kind of punishment for letting people know that an officer is a problem ?\nWINNER : First and foremost , when I brought it to the prison \u2019 s attention that I had filed the DOJ IG report , I was told , oh , you did that the wrong way .\nThat goes to Washington , DC , and we would never have seen it .\nWhich is ridiculous because that \u2019 s what we \u2019 re told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it within the prison , but the safest way to not have retaliation is if you go through the centralized federal government so there \u2019 s a documentation .\nThat way you can say I filed this .\nThey put me in the SHU .\nThe second was when they did finally interview me\u2014So they didn \u2019 t directly ask me but they said , do you feel like you \u2019 ve been victimized ?\nAre you a victim right now ?\nSo that \u2019 s when you \u2019 re like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means you are going to be separated and put in the SHU .\nGOSZTOLA : While you were at Carswell I presume you got to see that US prisons are not places for people to be sent it in order to help them deal with their drug addiction or substance abuse problems .\nWhat can you share about that ?\nThere are a lot of people who might suggest that \u2019 s what you can do if someone is having those issues .\nThose facilities could help them take care of that .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can go if you have a drug addiction is a county jail , and then later on , a prison\u2014either state of federal .\nBecause there are drugs in both institutions .\nEven more than that , you are sitting in all these triggers of what caused the addiction in the first place .\nYou \u2019 re in a powerless environment .\nYou are up front facing your depression , or whatever has triggered or started that addiction .\nIt \u2019 s not treated as a medical condition .\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s treated as a character flaw .\nIt \u2019 s treated as a , oh , well , if you just sit in this cell long enough and the methamphetamines are sweated out of your system , your addiction is over .\nWithout going to the root cause of why people use to escape .\nI went in , and I didn \u2019 t even have an alcohol habit .\nI had cut out all alcohol as a yoga teacher for two years before my arrest .\nDuring the George Floyd uprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people started passing me pills to get high .\nIt went from there to K2 , which is a liquid form of spice\u2014it makes you hallucinate\u2014to trying liquid meth on paper .\nBecause the pressure was so much that people were actually giving it to me for free at first because they thought I was going to swing on an officer .\nI was that tightly strung .\nI was that confrontational , and I was that unruly at times .\nI never had a physical addiction or craving to it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on lockdown for COVID , and we would go into the same lockdown conditions as the George Floyd lockdown , my mental dependency on using to cope with being confined\u2014I basically crept from one room to the other .\nThere were four officers in the unit , and I still managed to do it .\nI went to all the dealers and got 32 days worth of drugs , racked up like a 200 dollar bill to get myself through COVID itself and then the lockdown .\nIt became a mental dependency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an SSRI .\nAt the start of the lockdown , I realized that I have seasonal depression , and if I can \u2019 t go outside and feel the changing of the seasons , I get manic depression .\nSo I was already on an SSRI for that , and it wasn \u2019 t enough to cope with everything being taken away again for something that was outside of our control .\nOne of the things I feel the most guilty about is one of the girls that I used with , Zantana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fentanyl .\nEven before the lockdowns , this girl would pass out in chow at breakfast .\nShe stayed high like every day of her prison experience , and everybody knew it .\nAnd not to say that the guards should have known it to punish her further .\nBut that there was never an honest conversation with her about what rehabilitative services would help her kick this lifelong habit .\nShe got out shortly before I did in 2021 , and before I even had my ankle monitor cut off in October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overdose .\nSo you want to talk about what the prison system can offer addicts as far as rehabilitation goes , that \u2019 s a big failure right there .\nThey let her continue her habit in Carswell .\nShe never had a disciplinary write-up , was never caught for being high , even though everybody knew she was high every day she was in that prison .\nNobody said this is a psychological resource to deal with the root causes of your addiction .\nShe slipped through the cracks and now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that simply being pulled off the streets and put into confinement is a treatment for drug addiction\u2014I mean , they \u2019 re wrong .\nGOSZTOLA : When you left Carswell , you tried to stay in touch with some of the people you were incarcerated with .\nDid you try to communicate with some of the people you left because you cared about what they were going through in the facility ?\nWINNER : Yes , but one of the most inhumane things about this whole thing is you trust people with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardest days of your life with them .\nWhen you get out , it is a crime to stay in contact with them .\nMaybe there were times when I thought it was worth it\u2014letting people know , hey , I made it home .\nBut beyond that , it \u2019 s a one-way track back to prison .\nGOSZTOLA : I didn \u2019 t know that .\nWINNER : When you are on federal release , or federal probation , it \u2019 s a violation to be in contact with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incarcerated , currently on probation , or they \u2019 ve already finished their time and just have felon status .\nGOSZTOLA : Wait , so hypothetically , if someone was prosecuted under the Espionage Act like you and has this felony on their record , you can \u2019 t talk to them about your experience until after your probation ends ?\nWINNER : Correct .\nWell , and not even the Espionage Act .\nAnything .\nGOSZTOLA : I know it would go for anything , but I also understand that although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if anybody wanted to reach out to you and give you support now that you \u2019 re no longer in prison you wouldn \u2019 t want to do that because it could send you back to prison .\nWINNER : It \u2019 s kind of established that Terry Albury and me\u2014We \u2019 ll connect in the future .\nGOSZTOLA : That \u2019 s what I \u2019 m thinking of .\nI \u2019 m thinking of Jeffrey Sterling , who has gone through this who has their own experiences .\nJohn Kiriakou is actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t really talk to these people because they have felonies on their record .\nWINNER : Mmm-hmm , I can \u2019 t talk with anybody whose been incarcerated in a way that \u2019 s meaningful .\nSo there \u2019 s nobody that I \u2019 m legally allowed to talk to who has been through what I \u2019 ve been through .\n*** In Part 2 , which will be posted later , Reality Winner comments on NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden , President Donald

"Hailing from Glasgow in Scotland , the lads of Ashenspire make progressive metal for the working class that is grandiose and theatrical .\nThe lyrics are largely delivered as spoken word over instruments that amplify the dark storytelling and agitation of the narrator .\nThe story told , as the band puts it , is about \u201c hostile architecture \u201d under late capitalism , which refers to the \u201c design elements in social spaces that deter the public from using the object for means unintended by the designer , e.g .\nanti-homeless spikes.\n\u201d Each song draws inspiration from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nature , \u201d that are so often unfit for housing due to cost-cutting .\nFor example , the \u201c Law of Asbestos \u201d refers to the cancer-causing mineral that was incorporated into electrical insulation for many buildings , especially before the 1980s .\nAsbestos continues to kill hundreds of thousands of people each year .\nA metal-sounding saxophone accentuates Ashenspire \u2019 s rage : \u201c A corner cut , a penny saved , Grenfell burns again and again and again !\n\u201d \u2014a reference to the Grenfell Tower fire that resulted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a kind of anthemic quality to it .\nAt the end , Ashenspire proclaims : \u201c Fueled with your labour .\nBuilt with your bones .\nThere are no great men .\nOnly the great many.\n\u201d Then there \u2019 s the sprawling \u201c Cable Street Again.\n\u201d A tapestry of darkness percolates , sounding almost jazz-like in sections .\nAshenspire warns the dispossessed and disposable human beings faced with hostile architecture that is part of the threat of fascism .\n\u201c You can not fix that which is working as intended.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ashenspire belts out , \u201c Get down off the fence before the barbed wire goes up.\n\u201d ( Kevin Gosztola ) Sometimes it is necessary to look to the past to learn about the future .\nThat is the case with Jake Blount , a singer , multi-instrumentalist , and scholar whose stunning concept album weaves a compelling Afrofuturist narrative .\nThe album \u2019 s premise is similar to Octavia Butler \u2019 s influential 1993 science fiction novel Parable of the Sower , an apocalyptic tale of Black American refugees struggling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional Black spirituals , along with two original spoken word compositions , and imagines what Black religious music would sound like in a future ravaged by climate disruption .\nThree of the tracks feature rousing verses from rapper Demeanor .\n\u201c Take Me To the Water , \u201d a traditional hymn and first track on the album , morphs into an ominous prayer for those seeking to \u201c be washed for the sins of humanity.\n\u201d It is a call \u201c to reject the greed of our forefathers , \u201d who \u201c melted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , drowned the coast , emptied the seas and forests of life , filled the very ocean with fire.\n\u201d Not only does Blount prove he is a skillful musician , but in developing these themes throughout his album , he proves that he is also an archivist , historian , and prophet capable of sounding an alarm for humanity .\nUK grime-punk and hip hop duo Bob Vylan storm their way through a crash course on underclass survival in a capitalist world , where one \u2019 s life could be snuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c The BBC are talking about the GDP .\nThat means fuck all to me , \u201d Bob Vylan raps .\n\u201c I got ta eat.\n\u201d How the underclass lacks access and can not afford healthy food is the subject of \u201c Health is Wealth.\n\u201d Bob Vylan states , \u201c The killing of kids with \u00a32 chicken and chips is a tactic of war waged on the poor.\n\u201d But the damage done by junk food can also be self-inflicted , as the duo acknowledges , and the track develops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive .\nTake note of the album cover .\nIt \u2019 s a dark and brilliant nod to the way society dupes people into believing they may escape poverty if they could just win the lottery .\nSeveral of the songs incorporate thick guitar riffs to make the rhymes more potent .\nThat \u2019 s especially true on \u201c Phone Tap ( Alexa ) , \u201d a fierce assessment of the role that lower class people play in enabling a police state .\nBob Vylan raps , \u201c If somebody \u2019 s getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof .\nI was there , I was there , gather \u2019 round and gather proof.\n\u201d Then the cops come to the door , and the doorbell rings .\n\u201c Our babies \u201d are taken .\n\u201c Alexa , take me to prison , \u201d the duo roars at the end of their gutting indictment .\nXavier Amin Dphrepaulezz , who performs under the pseudonym Fantastic Negrito , recently discovered that his great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandparents were a white Scottish servant named Elizabeth Gallimore and a black slave whose name has been erased in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fantastic Negrito \u2019 s compelling concept album , which he released as a multimedia project with a companion film .\nThe album reclaims the story of the courageous forgotten , as emphasized on the \u201c Man with No Name.\n\u201d It contains a galvanizing message of hope and perseverance , particularly as he sings , \u201c I keep moving on.\n\u201d \u201c There \u2019 s a feeling out there right now that we can \u2019 t get anything done because we \u2019 re so polarized , so entrenched in our ideologies and unmoved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to share this story because I think it smashes that narrative to pieces , \u201d Fantastic Negrito shared .\n\u201c I stand on the shoulders of my ancestors , both Black and white , who showed me that anything is possible.\n\u201d From the ugliness of injustice to the beauty of what can be gained in the struggle , Fantastic Negrito grapples with it all in his music .\nEzra Furman \u2013 All Of Us Flames Ezra Furman breathes new life into a stale and largely heteronormative art form by incorporating themes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe album is the third in a trilogy of albums that includes 2018 \u2019 s \u201c Transangelic Exodus \u201d and 2019 \u2019 s \u201c Twelve Nudes.\n\u201d On \u201c Book Of Our Love , \u201d Furman expresses a desire to forever remember those who historically tend to have their identities erased .\nOn \u201c Lilac and Black , \u201d Furman dreams of \u201c my queer girl gang , \u201d whose enemies will eventually \u201c bow down before our wrath.\n\u201d \u201c It \u2019 s a queer album for the stage of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not a lone wolf , but depend on finding your family , your people , how you work as part of a larger whole , \u201d Furman declared .\n\u201c I wanted to make songs for use by threatened communities , and particularly the ones I belong to : trans people and Jews.\n\u201d Furman succeeds in crafting a vision of a world , where everyone may feel that they belong .\n( C.J .\nBaker ) Hurray For The Riff Raff \u2013 Life On Earth Puerto Rican singer-songwriter and self-described \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album is a worthy follow-up to their exceptional 2017 album , \u201c The Navigator.\n\u201d It explores themes of immigration , the environment , and other social ills .\nOne of the album \u2019 s many highlights is \u201c Precious Cargo , \u201d where Segarra sings , \u201c We made it to the border .\nI jumped and I was detained .\nSplit me from my family .\nNow the light begins to fade .\nThey took me to the cold room , where I sat down on the floor .\nJust a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days or more.\n\u201d \u201c I don \u2019 t know why he would lie on me .\nThe man from the I-C-E. And I don \u2019 t know why he hate on me .\nThe man from the I-C-E , \u201d Segarra adds , as she grapples with cruelty of immigration agents .\nThe album \u2019 s title track gorgeously acknowledges the peril from man-made climate change and other societal ills .\nYet despite the despair , throughout each song Segarra approaches the subject matter with an embrace of beauty and hopeful yearning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift of being able to express the humanity of the downtrodden .\nThankfully , they shared this precious gift with the world .\n( C.J .\nBaker ) \u201c In 1980 , Radio Haiti was shut down and all of its journalists were either executed , jailed or exiled alongside many of Haiti \u2019 s most prominent artists , intellectuals and academics , \u201d recalled Haitian American multi-instrumentalist Leyla McCalla .\nMcCalla \u2019 s \u201c Breaking The Thermometer \u201d project combines audio from the Radio Haiti archives to create Afro-Caribbean music that honors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictatorship of Jean-Claude Duvalier , as well as Jean-Claude \u2019 s father , Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier .\nThe songs are in English and Krey\u00f2l , a native language in Haiti .\nOver banjo and soft percussion , \u201c Fort Dimanche \u201d features a Kreyol radio clip that leads into McCalla singing about the prison , where Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier had entire families executed .\nA Haitian man describes when their family was killed at the prison and how it inspired him to become a journalist .\n( Note : At one point , the fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1920s . )\nThe song , \u201c Ekzile , \u201d is a somber melody mixing several string instruments over soft percussion .\nIt features a Haitian woman who recounts fleeing brutal repression and ending up in New York .\nMcCalla movingly grapples with what it is like for someone to have to leave their home because they are no longer safe .\n\u201c Le Bal est Fini \u201d ( \u201c The Party is Over \u201d ) stands out among all the tracks .\nIt is an invigorating tribute to the journalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements of the project shine , culminating in a solo that ends with dogs barking .\nJean Dominique , Radio Haiti \u2019 s owner , was murdered , and McCalla developed a close relationship with Mich\u00e8le Montas , Dominique \u2019 s widow .\nThe project honors their resistance .\n\u201c A big part of their connection and their love for each other was their love for journalism and their vision for what this could do to transform their country , \u201d McCalla told the Guardian .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a really hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that faith held them together.\n\u201d Our annual list , given Shadowproof \u2019 s journalism on prison abolition , would not be complete without this collaborative album from singer , songwriter , pianist , and scholar Samora Pinderhughes .\nFor \u201c GRIEF , \u201d a part of the Healing Project , Pinderhughes interviewed around 100 people of color who shared their experiences with incarceration or \u201c structural violence.\n\u201d The online archive of interviews features includes insights on abolishing prison , but the album is more introspective than essayistic and draws from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and life in a world of prisons .\nThrough the harmony of \u201c Holding Cell , \u201d Pinderhughes sings , \u201c Holding cell , I can \u2019 t get well while you hold me.\n\u201d The slave labor , or slaving for the tiniest of wages , comes through on , \u201c Hope , \u201d as Pinderhughes , Nio Norwood , and Jehbreal Jackson sing , \u201c While we try to build a room for our freedom ( for our freedom ) .\nWe build what they destroy.\n\u201d \u201c Masculinity \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective of a man grappling with their incarceration or carceral past .\n\u201c If I feel these things , is it gon na hurt me ?\n\u201d Pinderhughes wonders .\nThe lyrics eventually give way to an ethereal alto sax outro from Immanuel Wilkins .\nPinderhughes told the New York Times that he intended to explore how the machinery of incarceration operates and ask , what is the system doing to people ?\nWhat can be done to fight back ?\nAnd then , from a more personal perspective , \u201c How am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I implicated , and how am I doing something against it ?\nWhat does that make me feel like ?\n\u201d You feel every word of the experiences that flow through the music , as well as the spirituality of interrogating a harmful system that has impacted so many lives .\nSince their formation in 2014 , Soul Glo has built a reputation for their ferocious musical attack and radical political lyrics .\nThe hardcore punk band is made up of Black musicians who share their experiences as artists in a genre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album , the band dispels the myth that lasting change can come from continuing to prop up the two-party system .\nFor example , lead singer Pierce Jordan derisively snarls on \u201c John J , \u201d \u201c It \u2019 s been \u2018 fuck right wing \u2019 off the rip .\nBut still liberals are more dangerous.\n\u201d Elsewhere , with the incisive \u201c Fucked Up If True , \u201d Soul Glo address the fallacy that voting is enough to enact meaningful change .\n\u201c So we just gon always vote in false elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s effects as though people were powerless .\nDo you feel supportive care ?\nHow do you wake up everyday ?\nWhat enforced your belief that you can vote their power away ?\n\u201d The album is filled with killer anthems of righteous indignation that continue punk \u2019 s tradition of confronting racial and social injustice , and it is the band \u2019 s first release on renowned punk label Epitaph .\n( C.J .\nBaker ) Canadian Inuk singer Tanya Tagaq aims \u201c to repair the damage \u201d from trauma inflicted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks produced by Afrofuturist and poet Saul Williams , the album spits in the face of her oppressors then shifts away from their savagery to what gives Tagaq empowerment , joy , and strength .\n\u201c Teeth Agape \u201d bares a maternal instinct to protect her child from further trauma from colonizers while \u201c Earth Monster \u201d celebrates the creation of life .\n\u201c Today is for her , and today is for me .\nFor choosing to make her , to keep her , and to love her.\n\u201d \u201c They took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the album \u2019 s title track .\nShe vows , \u201c You can \u2019 t have my tongue , \u201d and later adds , \u201c I don \u2019 t want your shame.\n\u201d Her vocals grow more guttural as she confronts the loss of language that came as a result of white colonial settlers , who committed cultural genocide .\n\u201c The Canadian government took Indigenous children away from our families for many generations in the residential school system , \u201d Tagaq told NPR .\n\u201c All of us know who didn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocal artistry is a dagger aimed at the hearts of those complicit and responsible for all the pain and terror .\nBut the power in her voice also carries a sense of pride .\nShe does not want anyone \u2019 s sympathy or guilt in order to live life on her own terms\u2014free of the legacy and influence of colonizers .\n(
