ended I had the chance to watch Netflix \u2019 s Don \u2019 t Look Up and was simultaneously entertained , outraged and moved by it .\nComparisons to Doctor Strangelove are definitely in order , since this dark comedy centered around the premise of a killer asteroid heading toward Earth \u2013and the disastrous response from both elected officials and media personalities\u2013 so perfectly captures the banality of modern culture in the XXIst century , you quickly forget it is supposed to be a satire .\nBut perhaps the reason this movie impacted me in such a deep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve been thinking along the same lines for a long , looong time .\nIn fact , I even came up with a similar premise for an essay I wrote as far back as May of 2013 for the ( now defunct ) Intrepid magazine run by Scotty Roberts .\nThe only difference is that in my hypothetical scenario , NASA and president Obama announced the cometary impact with many years in advance , instead of the narrow 6-month window handled by Don \u2019 t Look Up ; a plot gimmick which allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but which arguably fails to capture the frustration of climatologists who have been warning us for DECADES about the catastrophic consequences in our collective decision to negate the reality of climate change \u2013the main purpose behind this movie in the first place .\nWhich is why I decided to share that old essay here on The Daily Grail , in the hope that you will not only appreciate this nostalgic glance through the rearview mirror \u2013despite the cringe I feel while judging at my old writing style , alongside the amazement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind this was written on a time before Donald Trump had seriously entered the political arena , and social media hadn \u2019 t become as ubiquitous ) \u2013 but also share my frustration on how little things have changed \u2013and when they do , it \u2019 s often for the worse\u2026 Our modern civilization seems to be perpetually plagued by the dangers provoked due to the scarcity of precious natural resources .\nSince the early 2000s articles in the media have been warning us about \u2018 Peak Oil \u2019 , \u2018 Peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHeck , there \u2019 s even fears about \u2018 Peak Helium \u2019 !\nwhich I \u2019 m sure keeps clowns & carnival managers awake at nights .\nBut the crisis that worries me the most is the shortage of an even more precious commodity : Trust .\nThat we live in the age of Peak Trust has become patently clear by the events that have shocked the world this year .\nWhen I first came across the news about the giant fireball on Russia last February* , I was amazed to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe the \u2018 official \u2019 meteor explanation !\nthe favored alternative explanations ranged from an Amerikinsky weapons test , a UFO or a even a message from the Big-G himself \u2013 \u2019 cause you know how Jehovah liked to go all Roland Emmerich in the Ancient Testament .\nI don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s too preposterous to explain this current Russian distrust on official channels by looking into the past , understanding it as the logical outcome of the way the Kremlin manipulated the news with propaganda during the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind that George Orwell based his landmark novel 1984 in the Stalinist regime of 1948 .\nOn the other side of the pond , things are no better by any stretch of the imagination .\nThe continuous streaks of domestic violence plaguing the United States \u2013Aurora , Connecticut , Newtown , Boston\u2013 have triggered a reflex reaction of distrust in mainstream media .\nIn the case of the Boston bombings , more people were consulting the live Tweet feeds than paying attention to the sponsored talking heads on the 24/7 news channels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both a slandering label in America , as well as a commercial brand selling all sorts of products customized to any kind of taste or sensibility .\n\u201c Tell me your favorite conspiracy theory , and I \u2019 ll tell YOU your political affiliation \u201d is one of my mottos \u2013and just so you know , it \u2019 s copyrighted , k ?\nAgain looking into the past to try to find a clue about the present , many people would agree that JFK \u2019 s assassination constituted a traumatic \u2018 loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Baby Boomer generation realized it was no longer possible to trust implicitly in everything the government said , the way their parents used to do when America was fighting the evil powers of the Axis .\nAnd not long after that came Vietnam & Watergate , and the toothpaste was squeezed out of the tube .\nOn my side of the border we also find quite a lot of mistrust in government institutions .\nOne of the most prominent political figures in the Mexican landscape is a man named Andres Manuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career out of denouncing endless conspiracies against him .\nEvery time he loses an election the man cries foul & demands a recount !\n** But like Russia & the USA , Mexicans have also suffered our own growing pains .\nThere was the Tlatelolco massacre of \u2019 68 , a wound that refuses to heal because those responsible were never tried & prosecuted .\nAnd if rumors of election fraud are so easy to believe , it \u2019 s because such practices were standard procedure for many decades .\nPeak Trust is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it .\nSo we \u2019 re living in an age where the public perception in government officials is at an ultimate low , where common citizens view financial institutions as white-collared thieves , and the hierarchy of churches as a band of hypocritical accomplices of pederasts .\nAh , but we still have Science , right ?\nthat immaculate ivory tower of uncompromising quest for the Truth !\nUnfortunately that tower is not without a few skeletons buried beneath its foundations .\nCase in point : The Cigarette Controversy .\nAs noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is conducted by scientists , who are not above corruptibility .\nGlobal warming & the Antivaxxing movement are excellent examples of just how rampant the distrust in Science is now ingrained in a substantial part of the population .\nBut Nature abhors a vacuum , and that \u2019 s equally true for human nature ; and the vacuum of trust in official institutions is easily filled by hawkers & peddlers of fear-mongering \u2013I need not name them , everybody knows who they are*** .\nAnd so it seems not a week goes by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this regularity causes a rather peculiar numbing effect in our minds .\nIt \u2019 s like the abuse of profanity in someone \u2019 s vocabulary : repeating F* # K so many times deprives the word of its intended potency .\nBut here \u2019 s the thing : That numbness is a potential threat .\nLike the proverbial frog that instinctively jumps out of a boiling pot of water , but will stay in the pot if the temperature is slowly increased , I view our getting used to expect the worst out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior .\nHow could a civilization be able to properly function and adapt to new threats without a modicum of confidence in the scaffolding of its social structure ?\nIf you see politicians as nothing but crooks and liars , where \u2019 s the incentive to follow their orders ?\nIf you think of your physician as a pill-peddler at the service of Big Pharma , why would you trust his diagnosis and follow his recipe ?\nSo the distrust is translated into stagnation and the waste of precious time .\nEither we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re destined to end up as frog soup .\nLet \u2019 s illustrate this with a hypothetical scenario : Suppose next month president Obama called for a press conference , announcing the detection of a massive asteroid heading towards our planet .\nThe impact , according to NASA scientists & confirmed by top astronomers around the world , was calculated for the year 2027 .\nThat would give us less than 14 years to coordinate an urgent international effort in order to launch an emergency program , so that we wouldn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinosaurs .\nI guarantee you that after 10 years of such an announcement , the emergency program would have made very little progress , because by then the public opinion would still be divided due to those denouncing the asteroid threat as a complete fabrication .\nAnd even the support of the United Nations would only help exacerbate the claims of those accusing the \u2018 defense asteroid program \u2019 as a smokescreen campaign \u2014 I do believe the proper term is \u2018 false flag attack.\n\u2019 Lying .\nA trait so common in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Genesis tale , when Cain feigns not knowing where his brother is after he rearranged Abel \u2019 s skull with an ass jawbone .\nBut looking away of religious interpretation , believe it or not there are scientific theories suggesting it \u2019 s our bullshitting nature one of the crucial factors to our species \u2019 vertiginous evolution .\nStudies with chimpanzees have proven our hairy cousins have a limited capacity to detect deception , because lying & cheating is an advantageous way to form coalitions , find food & mating .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying the facial features of those around us , trying to read their Po-po-poker face**** & call their bluff .\nWe pair sentience with deception .\nDon \u2019 t believe me ?\nThink of the ultimate trial for Artificial Intelligence : the Turing test .\nThe objective of the test is to see whether a computer program can successfully deceive you to believe you \u2019 re chatting with another person .\nLeave it to a scientist worried with masking his true sexual orientation to come up with such a trial\u2026 Does that mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not necessarily .\nIn hunter-gathering groups , lying carries a heavy penalty , since it may endanger the survival of the entire group .\nThese groups tend to be more egalitarian than the hierarchical we live in , and perhaps this fosters an appreciation for Truth , and the avoidance of deception \u2013at least among the members of the same clan/group .\nBut with increased numbers so to increase the chance to deceive your neighbor & getting away with it .\nI remember that scene in Spielberg \u2019 s film Amistad , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain to Cinque they need to retry the case again , even after they won .\nCinque \u2019 s response is very telling : Indeed , how can we ?\nBut the fact is that in our society we not only put up with deception , we recognize it as a tool to climb the social ladder \u2013The better you are lying , the faster your career will advance .\nAnd it takes a very peculiar personality to make a successful liar : a natural charisma mixed with a high level of intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empathy for the person or persons you \u2019 re deceiving .\nPeople who show all these characteristics are easily recognizable by psychiatrists : they call them psychopaths .\nThe loonies are running the asylum , my friends .\nThey always have been .\nBecause even though deception might have been an advantageous trait among our primate ancestors , like the rest of our violent proclivities so too we must find a way to rein to our lying impulses .\nWe must realize that level of bullshit has raised so high we \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that deception might pose a serious threat to our future .\nConsider the movie 2001 : A Space Odyssey .\nMost people think of that film as a Sci-Fi story in which a computer goes crazy , but almost everyone overlooks the reason why HAL goes bonkers : it \u2019 s heuristic programming couldn \u2019 t cope with its orders to withhold the information about the monolith discovered on the Moon from its human colleagues , which provokes a sort of cybernetic paranoia .\nWhen David Bowman & Frank Poole find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malfunction , how did they choose to respond ?\nBy LYING to Hal & go hiding on one of the pods with the sound off so they can scheme its disconnection !\nLies upon lies upon lies .\nI agree with Christopher Knowles : Dr. Heywood Floyd is the real villain of that flick .\nOr if you find 2001 to dry & intellectual for you , what about one of the greatest Sci-Fi spoofs of all times : Galaxy Quest !\nSo how do we go about getting rid of the bullshit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 approach favored by the so-called \u2018 Skeptic \u2019 groups ?\nIMO that has the exact opposite result , because the more you ridicule and mock a certain viewpoint , the more resistance you will engender among the same people you \u2019 re trying to convince \u2013what we might call the \u2018 LA LA LA I can \u2019 t hear you !\n\u2019 effect .\nSo ironically , all those pundits and pop scientists denouncing the insanity of the Mayan doomsday last year , probably helped promote it even more !\nSpeaking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my favorite \u2018 doomsday scenarios \u2019 \u2013mind you , NOT because I was expecting it to happen , but because it was a fun idea to consider\u2013 was that on that fateful day of Dec. 21st we would all wake up , get out of bed , have breakfast & go to our works , and suddenly we \u2019 d realize that everybody became telepathic !\nA major solar flare would have excited the human pineal gland & activate a dormant capacity in our brains or whatever .\nThink of it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s minds , it would truly be the end of the world as we know it !\nSpouses would know their other half was cheating on them , employers would learn what their employees REALLY thought about them\u2026 Politicians would run to a cliff like a band of neurotic lemmings , closely followed by the Wall Street stock brokers .\nPure , absolute chaos .\nSee why it \u2019 s such a fun scenario ?\nAlas , Dec 21st came and went , and our little peccadilloes remain secure in the safebox of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one could ask ?\nIn his first book Jadoo , John Keel narrates his encounter with at least 2 ascetic masters\u2013one in India , the other in Nepal\u2013 who seemed to have the capacity to read his thoughts .\nAn accomplishment reached after a lifetime of mental training and spiritual discipline , they explained to the young adventurer .\nCould we find a way to \u2018 mimic \u2019 telepathy , using our modern technology ?\nI believe we \u2019 re halfway there , whether we want it or not , thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social networks***** \u2013which is perhaps the veiled drive behind our governments \u2019 obsession with the regulation of online communications .\nThere \u2019 s also a great deal of research funded by DARPA , that mad-scientist wing of the US Defense Department , seeking to be able to scan and interpret the electrochemical activity in the human brain , and to wirelessly send direct command to the minds of soldiers .\nWith all this in the works , perhaps it \u2019 s not unlikely to predict that Deception has its days numbered .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to live in a world without lies , no matter how brutal it could be to be deprived of comfy delusions & false assumptions ?\nWould the eradication of Deception be what frightens us the most about the so-called Singularity ?\nWith the veil of lies , might we be also casting away that which we identify as the Human condition ?\nAre we sure we can handle the Truth ?\nWill the Truth set us free ?\nF* # k if I know , y \u2019 all !\nAll I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste of bullshit .\n( ** ) : As an update to this essay , in 2018 L\u00f3pez Obrador became president of Mexico , and during his first three years of office he has mounted attacks on NGOs , independent institutions and the free press on a daily basis .\nHe even has a weekly show on his morning conferences dedicated to discredit \u2018 fake news \u2019 .\nNow who does that remind you of ?\n?\n( *** ) : More than 8 years later , many of those names are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thanks to social media and podcasting .\n( ***** ) : While Elon Musk \u2019 s Neuralink may indeed bring us closer to real mind-to-mind communication , one could argue that Twitter , Facebook and Instagram already provide ample information into the thoughts of billions of human beings .", "author": "red pill junkie", "url":

.\nEvery time he loses an election the man cries foul & demands a recount !\n** But like Russia & the USA , Mexicans have also suffered our own growing pains .\nThere was the Tlatelolco massacre of \u2019 68 , a wound that refuses to heal because those responsible were never tried & prosecuted .\nAnd if rumors of election fraud are so easy to believe , it \u2019 s because such practices were standard procedure for many decades .\nPeak Trust is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it .\nSo we \u2019 re living in an age where the public perception in government officials is at an ultimate low , where common citizens view financial institutions as white-collared thieves , and the hierarchy of churches as a band of hypocritical accomplices of pederasts .\nAh , but we still have Science , right ?\nthat immaculate ivory tower of uncompromising quest for the Truth !\nUnfortunately that tower is not without a few skeletons buried beneath its foundations .\nCase in point : The Cigarette Controversy .\nAs noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is conducted by scientists , who are not above corruptibility .\nGlobal warming & the Antivaxxing movement are excellent examples of just how rampant the distrust in Science is now ingrained in a substantial part of the population .\nBut Nature abhors a vacuum , and that \u2019 s equally true for human nature ; and the vacuum of trust in official institutions is easily filled by hawkers & peddlers of fear-mongering \u2013I need not name them , everybody knows who they are*** .\nAnd so it seems not a week goes by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this regularity causes a rather peculiar numbing effect in our minds .\nIt \u2019 s like the abuse of profanity in someone \u2019 s vocabulary : repeating F* # K so many times deprives the word of its intended potency .\nBut here \u2019 s the thing : That numbness is a potential threat .\nLike the proverbial frog that instinctively jumps out of a boiling pot of water , but will stay in the pot if the temperature is slowly increased , I view our getting used to expect the worst out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior .\nHow could a civilization be able to properly function and adapt to new threats without a modicum of confidence in the scaffolding of its social structure ?\nIf you see politicians as nothing but crooks and liars , where \u2019 s the incentive to follow their orders ?\nIf you think of your physician as a pill-peddler at the service of Big Pharma , why would you trust his diagnosis and follow his recipe ?\nSo the distrust is translated into stagnation and the waste of precious time .\nEither we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re destined to end up as frog soup .\nLet \u2019 s illustrate this with a hypothetical scenario : Suppose next month president Obama called for a press conference , announcing the detection of a massive asteroid heading towards our planet .\nThe impact , according to NASA scientists & confirmed by top astronomers around the world , was calculated for the year 2027 .\nThat would give us less than 14 years to coordinate an urgent international effort in order to launch an emergency program , so that we wouldn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinosaurs .\nI guarantee you that after 10 years of such an announcement , the emergency program would have made very little progress , because by then the public opinion would still be divided due to those denouncing the asteroid threat as a complete fabrication .\nAnd even the support of the United Nations would only help exacerbate the claims of those accusing the \u2018 defense asteroid program \u2019 as a smokescreen campaign \u2014 I do believe the proper term is \u2018 false flag attack.\n\u2019 Lying .\nA trait so common in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Genesis tale , when Cain feigns not knowing where his brother is after he rearranged Abel \u2019 s skull with an ass jawbone .\nBut looking away of religious interpretation , believe it or not there are scientific theories suggesting it \u2019 s our bullshitting nature one of the crucial factors to our species \u2019 vertiginous evolution .\nStudies with chimpanzees have proven our hairy cousins have a limited capacity to detect deception , because lying & cheating is an advantageous way to form coalitions , find food & mating .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying the facial features of those around us , trying to read their Po-po-poker face**** & call their bluff .\nWe pair sentience with deception .\nDon \u2019 t believe me ?\nThink of the ultimate trial for Artificial Intelligence : the Turing test .\nThe objective of the test is to see whether a computer program can successfully deceive you to believe you \u2019 re chatting with another person .\nLeave it to a scientist worried with masking his true sexual orientation to come up with such a trial\u2026 Does that mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not necessarily .\nIn hunter-gathering groups , lying carries a heavy penalty , since it may endanger the survival of the entire group .\nThese groups tend to be more egalitarian than the hierarchical we live in , and perhaps this fosters an appreciation for Truth , and the avoidance of deception \u2013at least among the members of the same clan/group .\nBut with increased numbers so to increase the chance to deceive your neighbor & getting away with it .\nI remember that scene in Spielberg \u2019 s film Amistad , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain to Cinque they need to retry the case again , even after they won .\nCinque \u2019 s response is very telling : Indeed , how can we ?\nBut the fact is that in our society we not only put up with deception , we recognize it as a tool to climb the social ladder \u2013The better you are lying , the faster your career will advance .\nAnd it takes a very peculiar personality to make a successful liar : a natural charisma mixed with a high level of intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empathy for the person or persons you \u2019 re deceiving .\nPeople who show all these characteristics are easily recognizable by psychiatrists : they call them psychopaths .\nThe loonies are running the asylum , my friends .\nThey always have been .\nBecause even though deception might have been an advantageous trait among our primate ancestors , like the rest of our violent proclivities so too we must find a way to rein to our lying impulses .\nWe must realize that level of bullshit has raised so high we \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that deception might pose a serious threat to our future .\nConsider the movie 2001 : A Space Odyssey .\nMost people think of that film as a Sci-Fi story in which a computer goes crazy , but almost everyone overlooks the reason why HAL goes bonkers : it \u2019 s heuristic programming couldn \u2019 t cope with its orders to withhold the information about the monolith discovered on the Moon from its human colleagues , which provokes a sort of cybernetic paranoia .\nWhen David Bowman & Frank Poole find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malfunction , how did they choose to respond ?\nBy LYING to Hal & go hiding on one of the pods with the sound off so they can scheme its disconnection !\nLies upon lies upon lies .\nI agree with Christopher Knowles : Dr. Heywood Floyd is the real villain of that flick .\nOr if you find 2001 to dry & intellectual for you , what about one of the greatest Sci-Fi spoofs of all times : Galaxy Quest !\nSo how do we go about getting rid of the bullshit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 approach favored by the so-called \u2018 Skeptic \u2019 groups ?\nIMO that has the exact opposite result , because the more you ridicule and mock a certain viewpoint , the more resistance you will engender among the same people you \u2019 re trying to convince \u2013what we might call the \u2018 LA LA LA I can \u2019 t hear you !\n\u2019 effect .\nSo ironically , all those pundits and pop scientists denouncing the insanity of the Mayan doomsday last year , probably helped promote it even more !\nSpeaking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my favorite \u2018 doomsday scenarios \u2019 \u2013mind you , NOT because I was expecting it to happen , but because it was a fun idea to consider\u2013 was that on that fateful day of Dec. 21st we would all wake up , get out of bed , have breakfast & go to our works , and suddenly we \u2019 d realize that everybody became telepathic !\nA major solar flare would have excited the human pineal gland & activate a dormant capacity in our brains or whatever .\nThink of it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s minds , it would truly be the end of the world as we know it !\nSpouses would know their other half was cheating on them , employers would learn what their employees REALLY thought about them\u2026 Politicians would run to a cliff like a band of neurotic lemmings , closely followed by the Wall Street stock brokers .\nPure , absolute chaos .\nSee why it \u2019 s such a fun scenario ?\nAlas , Dec 21st came and went , and our little peccadilloes remain secure in the safebox of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one could ask ?\nIn his first book Jadoo , John Keel narrates his encounter with at least 2 ascetic masters\u2013one in India , the other in Nepal\u2013 who seemed to have the capacity to read his thoughts .\nAn accomplishment reached after a lifetime of mental training and spiritual discipline , they explained to the young adventurer .\nCould we find a way to \u2018 mimic \u2019 telepathy , using our modern technology ?\nI believe we \u2019 re halfway there , whether we want it or not , thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social networks***** \u2013which is perhaps the veiled drive behind our governments \u2019 obsession with the regulation of online communications .\nThere \u2019 s also a great deal of research funded by DARPA , that mad-scientist wing of the US Defense Department , seeking to be able to scan and interpret the electrochemical activity in the human brain , and to wirelessly send direct command to the minds of soldiers .\nWith all this in the works , perhaps it \u2019 s not unlikely to predict that Deception has its days numbered .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to live in a world without lies , no matter how brutal it could be to be deprived of comfy delusions & false assumptions ?\nWould the eradication of Deception be what frightens us the most about the so-called Singularity ?\nWith the veil of lies , might we be also casting away that which we identify as the Human condition ?\nAre we sure we can handle the Truth ?\nWill the Truth set us free ?\nF* # k if I know , y \u2019 all !\nAll I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste of bullshit .\n( ** ) : As an update to this essay , in 2018 L\u00f3pez Obrador became president of Mexico , and during his first three years of office he has mounted attacks on NGOs , independent institutions and the free press on a daily basis .\nHe even has a weekly show on his morning conferences dedicated to discredit \u2018 fake news \u2019 .\nNow who does that remind you of ?\n?\n( *** ) : More than 8 years later , many of those names are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thanks to social media and podcasting .\n( ***** ) : While Elon Musk \u2019 s Neuralink may indeed bring us closer to real mind-to-mind communication , one could argue that Twitter , Facebook and Instagram already provide ample information into the thoughts of billions of human beings .", "author": "red pill junkie", "url": "https://www.dailygrail.com/2022/01/peak-trust-reprint/", "published": "Sat, 08 Jan 2022 02:27:47 +0000", "published_utc":

"content": "A documentary about three white , middle-aged men finding themselves at the crossroads of life and feeling bored , lost and looking for answers might seem like the last thing you would want to watch .\nBut when that story involves those three men seeking out the powerful psychedelic 5MeO-DMT , it \u2019 s worth putting aside that first impression and sitting down and taking a look .\nThat \u2019 s exactly what I was able to do this week when the makers of the documentary 5MeO put the film on YouTube for free .\nAnd after watching it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same too ( you \u2019 ll have to be quick , it \u2019 s only up free until the 29th ! )\n.\nThe documentary begins by introducing the three friends , film-makers Boris , Frank and Charles : the trivialities of their lives , their motivations , but perhaps most importantly that they are currently in a bit of a rut and looking to find out how to be alive .\n\u201c I \u2019 m absolutely certain about nothing\u2026 I just don \u2019 t believe what anybody else says , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself.\n, \u201d says Frank , while Charles observes \u201c I \u2019 m a bit bored with the person I \u2019 ve become , to be honest.\n\u201d At some point , the three hatched a plan to try and shake up their lives , and their worldviews , by taking 5-MeO-DMT , considered to be one of the most potent psychedelics known .\nIt is found in a wide variety of plant types and at least one toad species , the Sonoran Desert Toad \u2013 the toad secretes a venom which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consciousness .\nFrank has done other psychedelics \u2013 mushrooms , LSD and ayahuasca \u2013 but Boris and Charles are psychedelic \u2018 virgins \u2019 .\nAs such , and because Frank has not yet even ever met Charles in real life , part one of the film ( after introducing the three men ) is about a separate psychedelic : magic mushrooms .\nThe three take a trip together to make sure they feel they are \u2018 up \u2019 to the more powerful 5-MeO-DMT .\nThis section adds to the introduction in helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank is a seeker , though quite a neurotic one who is constantly seeking answers and looking for what he can learn from new experiences .\nBoris \u2013 who perhaps has the most difficult of the mushroom trips \u2013 has a lot of baggage beneath the surface , and struggles a bit with the loss of control under the influence of psilocybin .\nAnd Charles , who outwardly is the most cynical of the three about the experience \u2013 \u201c I do believe in science , and I certainly don \u2019 t believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI like evidence on my toast \u201d , he notes at one point \u2013 ends up being the most open to the experience ( perhaps as a result of overcoming prostate cancer a decade previously ) .\nAfter this experience , the trio move on to organising a 5-MeO-DMT experience .\nIn the lead-up to this , anxiety and stress are evident \u2013 they have all read about the experience , how it obliterates the self , and the ontological shock it often causes due to the shifting of reality .\nPsychedelics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects of the 5MeO trip at this point : The terror inherent within a 5-MeO experience or DMT experience is the ontological shock .\nYou \u2019 re very quickly ripped from this general consensus reality , which we take as \u2018 the \u2019 reality , into another world which seems as real , if not more real , than this one\u2026yet is decidedly very , very different from this world .\nIt does seem to command the respect that it probably deserves , it \u2019 s not used in a classic recreational context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pub having a few pints and taking , and that would be extremely ill-advised as well .\nYou feel you \u2019 re having a complete loss or shift of identity , you can very quickly forget who or what you are .\nIt very quickly takes you into some categories and realms that you can only phrase in a mystical context .\nYou can have a 10 minute experience , which can completely change your worldview .\nThe three men then join up with their facilitator , Olli , who provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has toads , he no longer wishes to exploit them \u2013 as Charles says , \u201c we could see that we could have the same thing without squeezing the juice out of a living animal \u201d ) .\nThey each walk through their experience \u2013 their thoughts leading up to it , and then what they experienced during the intense 10 minutes under the influence ( as best they can \u2013 as they stress , there is no way of explaining such an ineffable experience ) .\nI \u2019 ll let you watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their own words , but two reactions are worth noting .\n\u2018 Materialist atheist \u2019 Charles observes that \u201c it \u2019 s terribly difficult to talk about because it feels so cheesy , but it was profound .\nI remember saying out loud that \u2018 this is bliss \u2019 and \u2018 this is enough to make you believe in an afterlife \u2019 .\n\u201d And when Frank is asked to provide his thoughts as to whether he took anything from the experience , he takes a good minute to answer \u2013 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he notes \u201c it \u2019 s amazing to not take anything out of it , when I \u2019 ve always taken stuff out of something .\nI \u2019 ve always taken shit out of things , or \u2018 what can I get out of this \u2019 .\nThat \u2019 s amazing.\n\u201d But it \u2019 s worth noting too , that they each offer their own warning about taking the psychedelic experience too lightly , or thinking that you can understand what it is from other people \u2019 s descriptions , which always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment .\nOverall , the film provides an excellent \u2018 real \u2019 look at people \u2019 s introduction and reaction to psychedelics .\nInstead of New Age hype , or governmental demonisation , we get honest assessments from the three about their experience , what they got out of it , and why \u2013 or even whether \u2013 they would recommend it to others .\nIf you enjoy the documentary \u2013 or miss seeing it while free on YouTube \u2013 you can do the right thing and support the film-makers by purchasing your

"First English sighting of \u2018ball lightning\u2019: a 12th century monk\u2019s chronicle reveals\u00a0all", "content": "On June 7 , 1195 , a fiery spinning ball emerged from a dark cloud in an erstwhile sunny sky close to the London lodgings of the bishop of Norwich .\nWitnesses could never have known that the natural phenomenon that they were seeing would defy scientific explanation for more than 800 years .\nFor what they observed has all the hallmarks of ball lightning : an atmospheric effect , the origin of which remains hotly disputed .\nAn account of this extraordinary moment survives in a monastic chronicle compiled between about 1180 and 1199 by Gervase , a monk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would appear that this is the first credible written record of ball lightning in England , and much more convincing than an earlier European description .\nPreviously the earliest record of a sighting was believed to be from the 17th century .\nThis extensive work ( nearly 600 pages in its modern edition ) records historical events in England and further afield , the friends and enemies of the monastic house , and descriptions of noteworthy or unusual natural phenomena .\nThe writing includes descriptions of solar and lunar eclipses , earthquakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what appears to be ball lightning while exploring Gervase \u2019 s records of natural events in his chronicle , a cornucopia of historical details giving insights into medieval culture .\nWe dug through hundreds of pages in Latin and stumbled across this sighting , detailed in our article in Weather , the journal of the Royal Meteorological Society .\nGervase \u2019 s records of natural events appear within the historical narrative , often with no preamble .\nThey were , nevertheless , clearly important enough to Gervase to be included .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installation of a new abbot of St Albans and the deposition of the abbot of Thorney .\nNo attempt is made to explain the \u201c marvellous sign \u201d in the sky seen near London .\nThe reader is left to draw their own conclusions .\nOne abbot takes up his post , another deposed , alongside the appearance of a fiery spinning ball .\nIn the chronicle it says : But Gervase appears to have been an astute observer and reporter of celestial activity .\nFor example , his seemingly fanciful description of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon is consistent with the formation of a vertical mirage from a column of hot air from activity such as iron working or bell casting .\nGervase \u2019 s description of ball lightning is also remarkably similar to modern reports .\nIt predates by nearly 450 years the next earliest contemporary report of ball lightning in England .\nThis comes from an account of the storm of October 21 1638 at Widecombe in Devon .\nWhile there is an earlier claim by Nicholas Walsh MP that in 1556 ball lightning killed his immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father \u2019 s estates , the story does not appear to have been recorded until 1712 by the historian Sir Thomas Atkyns .\nFor a long time ball lightning was regarded with scepticism .\nAlthough it is now generally accepted as a genuine phenomenon with thousands of reported sightings , there is still no accepted scientific explanation of its origin .\nHighly complicated theories include the burning of silicon from vaporised soil .\nMore recently , a suggestion has been made for light trapped inside a sphere of thin air .\nIt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains unsolved .\nAlthough rare , other long standing scientific puzzles do exist .\nOne , that intrigued medieval natural philosophers is the \u201c Moon illusion \u201d whereby the Moon appears larger when near the horizon than when it is high in the sky .\nThis was described by medieval thinkers , such as al-\u1e24asan Ibn al-Haytham ( born Basra , Iraq , in around AD965 and died in Cairo around AD1040 ) and Robert Grosseteste ( 1170-1253 ) .\nThe effect is still not totally resolved .\nIt is certainly a psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observers believed , associated with refraction .\nAnother is the origin of ferromagnetism , seen in the attraction between permanent magnets and iron ( fridge door magnets are well known examples )

mystery objects that transit precisely 23.1 minutes apart", "content": "Astronomers have discovered a ring of planetary debris that appears to contain 65 moon-sized structures orbiting close to a white dwarf star .\nThe curious part : each structure passes in front of the star on a regular basis , precisely every 23.1 minutes \u2013 a mystery , researchers say , they \u201c can not currently explain \u201d .\nIn the study , published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society , an international team of researchers measured light from a white dwarf in the Milky Way known as WD1054\u2013226 .\nBy monitoring dips in the light received from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other structures as they transit between the star and telescopes during their orbits .\nTo their surprise , in this case they found pronounced dips in light corresponding to 65 evenly spaced clouds of planetary debris orbiting the star every 25 hours .\nFurthermore , the researchers concluded that the precise regularity of the transits suggests they are kept in such a precise arrangement by a nearby planet \u2013 and that planet would be in the \u201c habitable zone \u201d of the star , an orbit of the right distance to allow water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : An exciting possibility is that these bodies are kept in such an evenly-spaced orbital pattern because of the gravitational influence of a nearby planet .\nWithout this influence , friction and collisions would cause the structures to disperse , losing the precise regularity that is observed .\nA precedent for this \u2018 shepherding \u2019 is the way the gravitational pull of moons around Neptune and Saturn help to create stable ring structures orbiting these planets .\nThe unfortunate news , for those wondering if these curious structures might have been created by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habitable zone for a white dwarf is smaller and closer to the star \u2013 the white dwarf stage of a star \u2019 s life occurs when it runs out of its hydrogen fuel , shrinks and loses its heat .\nWhat this means is that the structures orbit in an area that previously would have been enveloped by the star when it was in its previous red giant stage of stellar evolution .\nAs such , they are likely to have only existed since recently ( relatively speaking in space terms\u2026perhaps a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life still has a chance in this system : astronomers think that during this white dwarf stage period of the star \u2019 s existence , the \u2018 Goldilocks zone \u2019 that is conducive to the presence of water and life would be habitable for at least two

case as part of \u201c a wider range of issues in reverse engineering of complex , esoteric materials , and aerospace forensics.\n\u201d So what is the \u2018 incident \u2019 that the research refers to ?\nOn the evening of Saturday , December 17 , 1977 , a \u201c luminous red mass \u201d was observed by two residents of Council Bluffs , Iowa falling from the sky near the northern city limits : A bright flash was seen , followed by flames 8\u201310 feet high .\nWhen they reached the scene , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal that glowed red-orange , igniting the grass .\nPolice and a fireman arrived within 15 min and saw the mass ( with estimates ranging from 35 to 55 pounds ) \u201c running , boiling down to the edges of the levee , \u201d in an area of about 4 feet by 6 feet .\nThe central portion remained warm to the touch for approximately 2h .\nNo cratering was noticed .\n\u2026After ascertaining that the material was not radioactive , two chemical analyses were rapidly conducted , one at the Iowa State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pipe Products Company .\nBoth agreed with the determination that the material was a metallic alloy , chiefly iron with small amounts of nickel and chromium .\nThe report indicated that the micro-structure suggested the studied sample was carbon steel that was cast , subsequently re-heated to about 1000\u25e6 and cooled at an intermediate rate , so that it resembled wrought iron ( wrought iron is an alloy containing low carbon content in the 0.08 % or less level ) .\nNo pictures of the \u2018 microstructure \u2019 were provided in the historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that nothing accounted for the way a large amount of that very heavy and extremely hot material could have been deposited in that area in a molten state , following the clear observation of a luminous object in the sky , ( the purported source of the material ) which remained unidentified .\nInvestigators were afterwards able to gather testimony from 11 witnesses in all , in separate groups , to the incident .\nNotably , two of those witnesses said that when they saw the object in the sky , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling , and they described it as round with \u201c red lights blinking in sequence around the periphery.\n\u201d With the amount of detail given , the consistency of the observations , and the material evidence on the ground , investigators considered five hypotheses to explain the incident : \u2022 A hoax perpetrated by pouring molten metal on the ground However , none of these explanations seemed to provide a decent answer \u2013 the first three were dismissed due to the lack of cratering and the molten state of the material , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions unanswered ( what was the object that was seen falling , how was the molten metal transported , etc ) .\nWas the material on the ground , investigators wondered , actually ejected from the hovering object ?\nThe paper then notes the results of both the original analysis of the materials , as well as their new analyses using more advanced equipment performed on a sample of the material retained by Jacques Vallee from his original investigation .\nFrom all of these , it was found that the material is composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 1 % of alloying metals such as nickel and chromium\u2026the slag was a foam material containing metallic iron and aluminum with smaller amounts of mag- nesium , silicon , and titanium.\n\u201d This elemental make-up was highly suggestive that the material was not of meteoritic origin , or from a piece of man-made space hardware .\nThe more recent isotopic analysis also led to an initial conclusion \u201c that sample components were consistent with a terrestrial origin \u201d , and further advanced analysis using multiplexed ion beam imaging confirmed that isotope ratios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 although significant differences were noted in the homogeneity of the elements across samples .\nFinally , researchers speculated on possible explanations for the incident .\nOne hypothesis was that it might be related to the crash of a Soviet reconaissance satellite just five weeks later \u2013 however , it was decided that there was no connection between the two events .\nAnother suggestion \u2013 based on the eyewitness report that the object was hovering \u2013 was that the molten mass might have been ejected from a UFO ( though the researchers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nHowever , the researchers note : Even in such a speculative area , the scientific steps to be taken are not fundamentally different from those we have outlined above .\nOne would have to ask , does the catalogue of elements found in the material cause us to believe it does not come from our planet ?\nThe materials from Council Bluff show no evidence suggesting it was engineered or designed .\nThe material would not be expected to form naturally , and as shown does have unusual inhomogeneity .\nWhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does not mean it could not be created by methods even extant in the 1970s .\nThe researchers do note , however , that liquid metal has been identified by some scientists as possibly being useful as \u201c part of some propulsion or power generation system \u201d , though they also are clear that \u201c no such device has been reported to date , so such ideas remain highly speculative \u201d .\nNevertheless , they do mention speculation that in such a system , \u201c depleted fluid might need to be occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper sets up a rationale for further investigations along the same lines as has been carried out with the Council Bluffs material .\nWhile their analysis did not solve this particular mystery , in their final summary the researchers do feel compelled to discuss that there have been numerous cases over the last several decades of reports of material being dropped from , or ejected by , \u201c unknown aerial objects \u201d ( the words you use when you don \u2019 t want to say UFO ) : It has not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to bring full range of current materials analysis capabilities to bear .\nDeep metallurgical analysis by specifically trained analysts will need to be consulted for each different material as warranted .\nRecently , news reports have suggested the presence of other aerial craft of unknown provenance witnessed by Navy pilots concurrently detected with electronic sensors and visual identification .\nWhile the data collected about this set of events does not include any material evidence , the day might come when materials from such events are available to be examined .\nApproaches that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale are now applicable to such studies , including such devices as atom probes and cryo-electron microscopy .\nSince technology has considerably improved since 1977 , we are now better prepared to analyze such events , with a view to bringing previously unidentified episodes into the scope of practical and reproducible science .\nThe objective is to provide data in an open-source manner so that others might replicate the analytic approaches or divine a testable hypothesis of why and how such materials are deposited or left behind .\nIn regards to the Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note that \u201c the data is verifiable\u2026 it is only the origin and nature of the material ( and the phenomenon in general ) that remains open.\n\u201d Garry Nolan discussed his research analysing multiple samples of alleged UFO materials \u2013 from not just the Council Bluffs case , but other cases as well \u2013 in a recent interview with Lex Friedman .\nHe confessed that \u201c several of the things that I \u2019 ve looked at , we \u2019 ve found to be completely banal or were pieces of aircraft \u201d .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of the samples in his possession are somewhat anomalous , in particular those with odd isotopic ratios ( which was not observed in the Council Bluffs case , but during the interview he references another case , from Ubatuba , Brazil ) .\nEven then though , he notes that the anomalies are simply a point of departure for further research or speculation , rather than any kind of hard evidence of alien visitation : Nolan is a fascinating individual \u2013 impeccable scientific credentials but also a deep interest in anomalies ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alien mummy \u2019 ) \u2013 so in a future post I \u2019 ll do more of a deep dive into his interview with Lex Friedman as there \u2019 s plenty else to unpack in there beyond this single topic .", "author": "Greg", "url":

all-time TDG favorites \u2014Graham Hancock and Rupert Sheldrake\u2014 recorded on November of 2021 for the Beyond the Brain conference series , in which the two heavyweights of alternative thinking hold no punches , and just go all the way with the deepest questions in the history of deep questioning : What is the nature of consciousness ?\nIs there a reason why we exist at all ?\nWhat happens to us when we die ?\nAnd the title of this post is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Lest we forget that it \u2019 s been almost 9 years since TED took the shameful decision of deleting the two lectures given by both authors for TEDx Whitechapel from their webpage , at the behest of skeptics who complained about the \u2018 unscientific \u2019 nature of their presentations \u2013nine years ?\n?\nTime sure does fly when one is busy bringing down the current materialistic paradigm !\nTruth be told , much has changed in the world in these nine years .\nFor starters , Ayahuasca \u2013the main theme behind Hancock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no longer a fringe topic in obscure forums and bulletin boards , and it is well on its way of becoming a recognized mainstream therapeutic tool for the treatment of many psychological problems , including acute depression and substance addiction , alongside many other psychedelic drugs which are having a second comeback from the ashes of the 60 \u2019 s revolution \u2013which will bring a new set of problems now that billionaires and pharmaceutical companies are being lured by new business opportunities , as Sheldrake points out during the discussion .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consciousness , which has been the subject of most of Sheldrake \u2019 s bibliography , it remains as intractable as ever , despite the huge advances made in A.I .\nand computer algorithms .\nHaving neurologists finally throwing up their hands , and admitting that perhaps they should start giving a serious look at the possibility that consciousness is not confined to the boundaries of our skull does still seem rather improbable \u2013but then again , if back in 2013 someone had told me UFOs would finally break the glass ceiling of respectability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times in just four more years ( ! )\nI would have considered that another pipe dream .\nAs someone who has recently gone through the painful death of a parent , the most significant part of the video is when Sheldrake speculated about life after death , and the many similarities it may have with dreaming \u2014 \u201c When we die we go on dreaming , but we can \u2019 t wake up anymore \u201d , as he put it\u2013 which opens up the very elegant and non-dogmatic possibility that our afterlives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dreamworlds of other beings we \u2019 ve known ) may end up being composed not only of our hopes , expectations and life experiences\u2026 but also of our traumas and terrors .\nIndeed , we may be building the customized heavens and hells we shall dwell in after we stop drawing breath , with every

extraterrestrial weapon \u2013 or in less click-bait terms ( though perhaps equally as fascinating ) , a dagger made out of a meteor .\nThe discovery was thought to be yet another artefact confirming the ancient Egyptians \u2019 veneration and use of iron from meteorites .\nBut was this particular meteoritic artifact actually made in Egypt ?\nRecent research suggests that , surprisingly , the famous dagger may not have been made by Egyptian hands .\nIn a paper titled \u201c The manufacture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c , researchers explain how in undertaking chemical analysis of the dagger found with Pharaoh Tutankhamen in his tomb , they not only were able to identify the type of meteorite from which it was derived , but also perhaps help prove where it was made .\nThe ( non-destructive ) analysis by scientists at the Chiba Institute of Technology in Narashino , Japan found that the nickel in the dagger was distributed in a certain way ( a \u2018 Widmanst\u00e4tten pattern \u2019 ) that is typical of a group of meteorites called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elemental composition of the hilt of the dagger , they also found a small percentage of calcium that suggested a lime plaster may have been used to \u2018 glue \u2019 its decorative stones \u2013 lapis lazuli , carnelian , malachite and fine grains of gold \u2013 in place .\nHowever , lime plasters were not used in Egypt in Tut \u2019 s time ( ca .\nthe 14th century BCE ) \u2013 it wasn \u2019 t used until more than a thousand years later , in the Ptolemaic period .\nThis provides circumstantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s dagger was originally one of a number of gifts sent to Tut \u2019 s grandfather Amenhotep III ( 1417\u20131379 BC ) by Tusratta , the king of Mitanni , in southeast Anatolia , when he married the princess Taduhepa to Amenhotep III .\nThe gift of a dagger resembling Tut \u2019 s is listed as one of the gifts in the \u2018 Amarna letters \u2019 , a diplomatic correspondence almost all written in Akkadian : Anatolia also seems a good fit due to it being another region \u2013 like Egypt \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient times .\nThe oldest known iron dagger made of meteoritic iron was actully found in a burial in Alacuh\u00f6y\u00fck , Anatolia dating back to ca .\n2300 BCE .\nAnd , unlike Egypt , suitable iron processing technology and the use of lime plaster was already prevalent in the region at the time .\nThe researchers summed up their findings : The intermediate Ni content ( 11.8 \u00b1 0.5wt % ) with the Widmanst\u00e4tten pattern implies the source iron meteorite for the Tutankhamen dagger blade to be octahedrite .\nSulfur-rich black spots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely remnants of troilite ( FeS ) inclusions in the source iron meteorite .\nThe preserved Widmanst\u00e4tten pattern and the remnant troilite inclusion show that the iron dagger was manufactured by low-temperature ( < 950\u00b0C ) heat forging .\nThe gold hilt with a few percent of calcium lacking sulfur suggests the use of lime plaster instead of gypsum plaster as an adhesive material for decorations on the hilt .\nSince the use of lime plaster in Egypt started during the Ptolemaic period (

Ancient Egypt", "date": "2022-03-06", "source": "dailygrail", "title": "Stonehenge may have been a rock calendar built with knowledge from Ancient Egypt", "content": "There are an endless number of theories as to the purpose of Stonehenge , the most famous stone circle in the world .\nWhile some are truly out there , the most commonly accepted possibilities usually revolve around some sort of time-keeping using the Sun , Moon and stars .\nHowever , there has never been any consensus on which of those theories is correct \u2013 and now , another has been added to the list : that the megaliths themselves might have acted as a \u2018 count \u2019 of the days and months of the year .\nIn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , published this month in the prestigious journal Antiquity , English archaeologist Timothy Darvill describes how the famous megaliths might have acted as \u201c a Late Neolithic solar calendar \u201d .\nHe notes that one of the few things that is agreed upon with Stonehenge is that the solstices ( the times of the year when the Sun reaches its most northern and southern points on the horizon as it rises and sets ) are embedded into the architecture of the monument , which \u201c strongly suggests a solar-based system.\n\u201d With this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers of stones in different parts of the circle seemed to fit well with ancient systems of yearly time-keeping : the \u2018 Sarsen Circle \u2019 has thirty uprights , the \u2018 Trilithon Horeshoe \u2019 has five components , and there are four \u2018 Station Stones \u2019 .\n\u201c The core of the year is represented by the Sarsen Circle , \u201d Darvill says .\n\u201c Here , each of the 30 uprights represents a solar day within a repeating 30-day month .\nTwelve monthly cycles of 30 days , represented by the uprights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar days.\n\u201d Furthemore , he points out , moving around this circle from the main axis , there are anomalously sized stones at # 11 and # 21 , suggesting perhaps that the 30 day month was divided into three \u2018 weeks \u2019 , or \u2018 decans \u2019 , of ten days each .\nNotably , however , Darvill did not find a section of the monument that might be used to count through the 12 cycles of 30 day months \u2013 though he does suggest that \u201c it is possible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the north-eastern entrance somehow marked this cycle.\n\u201d With the true solar year actually being fairly close to 365.25 days though , rather than 360 days , Darvill says that other sections of the Stonehenge site could have been used to keep the calendar accurate : Completing the basic tropical year requires an additional five days : an intercalary month of days known in later calendars as epagomenal days .\nThe five components of the Trilithon Horseshoe , situated prominently in the centre of the structure , fit this role\u2026 Adding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Making the solar calendar a perpetual one , in which the days , decans and months keep pace with the seasons and the movements of the sun to describe a tropical solar year with accuracy , requires periodic adjustment , specifically , the addition of one day every four years to create a leap-year of 366 solar days .\nThe four Station Stones provide a means of keeping tally so that a sixth day could be added to the intercalary month every fourth year .\nFurthermore , he says that \u201c using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synchronised with celestial movements and the changing of the seasons.\n\u201d Ironically , though , this theory removes a lot of the puzzling about possible alignments found in many of the other theories about Stonehenge \u2019 s use ( with so many stones , it \u2019 s very easy to make your theory fit if you draw enough lines ) .\nIn Darvill \u2019 s theory , the solstice alignments are just there as checks and balances ; the counting is done purely by using the stones , rather than alignments or shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just with a new theory about how Stonehenge might work , Darvill then extends on his thoughts by suggesting that the knowledge to build such a calendar may have come from a far-away land .\nWhile he does acknowledge that \u201c it is entirely possible that communities living in north-western Europe during the late fourth and third millennia BC developed a solar calendar of the type suggested here on their own initiative \u201d , he also points out that \u201c the uniqueness of Stonehenge\u2026prompts a pause for thought \u201d : External influences may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developments 3500km away in the Eastern Mediterranean .\nHere , during the fourth millennium BC , a variety of lunar-stellar calendars used observational astronomy to reconcile the movements of the moon and stars with the daily and seasonal cycles of the sun .\nDuring the early third millennium BC , however , increased interest in solar deities , such as the cult of Ra , led to the development in Egypt of a 365-day solar calendar , known as the Civil Calendar\u2026 Just as at Stonehenge , the calendar comprises twelve 30-day months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five epagomenal days .\nThe months are each divided into three weeks of 10 days .\nThe need for an additional day every four years to keep track with the seasons was understood , although not implemented until much later .\nIs it likely though that Ancient Egyptian calendar techniques would have been adopted by the people living far away in what is now southern England ?\nDarvill references recent finds that are indicative of long-distance contact and trade at this remote time in history ( around 4,500 years ago ) .\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 was buried five kilometres south-east of Stonehenge around 2,300 BC with an array of grave goods that included some from continental Europe .\nIsotope analysis shows that he was born and raised in the Alps and moved to Britain as a teenager .\nAnd Ancient Egypt is known to have engaged in long-distance trade well beyond its border during Early Dynastic times : stone vessels and scarabs were found at Minoan Crete .\nAmongst the earliest known imports to Britain is a large , red-glass bead from a barrow located 2.3km south-west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Egypt in the early second millennium BC .\nThe new theory has received mixed reviews from Darvill \u2019 s peers : This Stonehenge calendar system \u201c makes a lot of sense , \u201d says David Nash at the University of Brighton , UK .\n\u201c I like the elegant simplicity of it.\n\u201d Others are not so sure .\n\u201c It \u2019 s certainly intriguing but ultimately it fails to convince , \u201d says Mike Parker Pearson of University College London , UK .\n\u201c The numbers don \u2019 t really add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trilithon equal one upright of the sarsen circle to represent 1 day ?\nThere \u2019 s selective use of evidence to try to make the numbers fit.\n\u201d [ Sacha Stern , an expert in ancient calendars at University College London ] is not convinced by the argument that the Stonehenge calendar system originated elsewhere .\n\u201c I wonder if you need to invoke the Egyptians .\nWhy can \u2019 t we just imagine that [ the people who built Stonehenge ] created the whole system by themselves ?\nThey certainly knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that point onwards you just have to count the days , and it won \u2019 t take long to figure out how many days you need in the year.\n\u201d As with all things lost to history , it may be that we \u2019 ll never know exactly what Stonehenge was meant to be used for .\nBut it \u2019 s always interesting to throw ideas out there and see if we can find corroborating evidence for them .", "author": "Greg", "url":

We already know the answer!", "content": "Does your life \u2018 flash before your eyes \u2019 when you die ?\nThat \u2019 s the question that has been posed by numerous media platforms in the wake of the release of a study at the end of February that documented an EEG recording taken ( by chance ) during a patient \u2019 s final moments .\nAn 87-year-old man had needed surgery after having a fall and experiencing a brain bleed .\nAfter the operation , he began to have seizures and so to monitor his brain signals was attached to an electroencephalogram ( EEG ) \u2013 he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs a result , it was found that in the 30 seconds before and after his heart stopping there was a surge in brain activity \u2013 and what \u2019 s more , in the gamma wave range , which is associated with consciousness , learning and memory .\nIt \u2019 s worth noting , however , that this study is recounting just a single case \u2013 and nobody really knows exactly what the man experienced .\nMost of the media hype about the study resulted from a throwaway line by one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn from this research is : although our loved ones have their eyes closed and are ready to leave us to rest , their brains may be replaying some of the nicest moments they experienced in their lives , \u201d Ajmal Zemmer had told the Daily Mail .\nVirality ensued , and the news spread around the globe .\nThat doesn \u2019 t mean it \u2019 s not worth paying attention to \u2013 an excellent article in Vice on the topic mentions that this study somewhat corroborates a few other previous studies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care and organ donation .\nBut it might be a stretch to conclude that the surge of gamma wave activity means that the man was consciously experiencing something during his final moments .\nThe odd thing about the media hype about this study \u2013 given that it referred to a single case and guesswork was needed to assume what the man was experiencing \u2013 is that there is already plenty of evidence telling us that this does in fact occur .\nThat evidence can be found in the near-death experience ( NDE ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness proper with the publication of Raymond Moody \u2019 s 1975 bestseller Life After Life .\nIn his investigation of the experience , Moody found numerous cases of people who died and returned \u2013 or in some cases , simply came close to death \u2013 reporting that their life did indeed \u2018 flash before their eyes \u2019 .\nAlthough that is perhaps a rather superficial description : NDErs reported \u2018 panoramic \u2019 life recalls of great fidelity and emotional weight in which , sometimes , they somehow were shown their entire lives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their actions from the point of view of those they interacted with .\nMoody found so many of these reports , in fact , that he made the life recall aspect part of his \u2018 archetypal \u2019 NDE example .\nDuring an NDE , Moody said , an experiencer often\u2026 We know that this wasn \u2019 t just an invention by Moody that has since turned up in later NDEs purely through expectation , as we have historical examples that confirm this element of NDEs .\nIn my essay on pre-Moody experiences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I note the near-death experience recounted by British Navy Admiral Francis Beaufort , which occurred when he almost drowned in 1791 : With the violent but vain attempts to make myself heard I swallowed much water ; I was soon exhausted by my struggles , and before any relief reached me sank below the surface \u2013 all hope had fled \u2013 all exertions ceased \u2013 and I felt that I was drowning\u2026 \u2026Though the senses were thus deadened , not so the mind ; its activity seemed to be invigorated in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought rose after thought with a rapidity of succession that is not only indescribable , but probably inconceivable by anyone who has not himself been in a similar situation .\nThe course of these thoughts I can even now in a great measure trace\u2026traveling backwards , every past incident of my life seemed to glance across my recollection in retrograde succession ; not , however , in mere outline , as here stated , but the picture filled up with every minute and collateral feature .\nIn short , the whole period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in a kind of panoramic review\u2026indeed , many trifling events which had been long forgotten then crowded into my imagination , and with the character of recent familiarity\u2026 The length of time that was occupied by this deluge of ideas , or rather the shortness of time into which they were condensed , I can not now state with precision .\nSimilarly , explorer Admiral Richard Byrd had a near-death experience during his Antarctic expedition in which \u201c I saw my whole life pass in review \u201d , and \u201c realized how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d .\nAnd in 1892 , Zurich geology professor Albert Heim presented his findings from 25 years of research into the experiences of people who had survived acute life-threatening situations , in particular mountain climbers .\nHis summation not only touches on the idea of a life recall , but also the recent study \u2019 s suggestion that there is a burst of brain activity : \u201c Mental activity became enormous , \u201d Heim noted , \u201c rising to a hundred-fold velocity or intensity .\nThe relationships of events and their probably outcomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion entered at all .\nTime became greatly expanded\u2026 In many cases there followed a sudden review of the individual \u2019 s entire past.\n\u201d Furthermore , on the idea of a burst of brain activity after the point of physical death , we have the testimony from \u2018 veridical NDEs \u2019 , where an experiencer relates things that happened while they were unconscious \u2013 and sometimes clinically dead \u2013 that they should not have been able to perceive .\nOne such case is that of \u2018 Dentures Man \u2019 , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn this case from 1979 , a 44-year-old man ( \u2018 Mr .\nB \u2019 ) was brought into the emergency department at Canisius Hospital in the Netherlands by ambulance , after being discovered comatose , hypothermic and without a pulse in a cold , damp meadow in the middle of the night .\nHospital staff , including the senior nurse ( \u2018 T.G.\n\u2019 ) , were beginning resuscitation on the patient when T.G .\nnoticed that Mr. B was wearing dentures , so removed them and placed them on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could put a ventilation mask on the unconscious man .\nAfter Mr. B was successfully \u2018 brought back \u2019 , he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit , and so T.G .\ndid not see the man again until a week later while doing rounds distributing medication .\nT.G .\nwas astonished when , as he walked into the room , the patient he had brought back to life suddenly exclaimed \u2018 \u2018 Oh , that nurse knows where my dentures are !\n\u2019 \u2019 .\nSeeing the look of surprise on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained himself : since coming back to consciousness , Mr. B. had been looking for his dentures .\n\u2018 \u2018 You were there when I was brought into hospital and you took my dentures out of my mouth and put them onto that cart , \u201d he said .\n\u201c It had all these bottles on it and there was this sliding drawer underneath and there you put my teeth \u201d .\nT.G .\nwas confused by this , as he remembered that he had done this when the patient was unconscious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life : When I asked further , it appeared the man had seen himself lying in bed , that he had perceived from above how nurses and doctors had been busy with CPR .\nHe was also able to describe correctly and in detail the small room in which he had been resuscitated as well as the appearance of those present like myself .\nAt the time that he observed the situation he had been very much afraid that we would stop CPR and that he would die .\nAnd it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patient \u2019 s prognosis due to his very poor medical condition when admitted .\nThe patient tells me that he desperately and unsuccessfully tried to make it clear to us that he was still alive and that we should continue CPR .\nHe is deeply impressed by his experience and says he is no longer afraid of death .\nGiven the abundance of first-hand evidence related to conscious experience , and life recalls , given by those who have approached and sometimes gone beyond the point of death , the media hype @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case with an ambiguous EEG signal seems rather odd !", "author": "Greg",

Elizondo Mentions (In)Famous Ica Stones of Peru During Interview", "content": "There was a time when the very name of Luis Elizondo was seldom mentioned within the corridors of power of the Pentagon .\nHe was only mentioned as \u201c L \u201d in hushed tones by people in the know \u2013at least according to the story shared by rockstar-turned-UFO entrepreneur Tom DeLonge during the launch of the To the Stars Academy of Arts and Science in 2017 .\nIn that video DeLonge introduced Elizondo to the world with a promise that their joint venture would bring about a new era of UFO transparency and the development of space technologies \u2013what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disclosure \u2019 .\nFast forward four years and a half later : Elizondo parted ways with DeLonge , TTS dropped the \u2018 Academy \u2019 from their acronym and the closest they \u2019 ve come to outer space is their new line of apparel in a partnership with NASA ( because apparently NASA engineers couldn \u2019 t figure out a way to sell hoodies to the American public all by their own ) .\nMeanwhile the former counterintelligence special agent and purported director of AATIP has become much more comfortable with making public appearances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sorts of Youtube shows and podcasts .\nIn his latest ( and rather long ) online interview in the Theories of Everything channel with Curt Jaimungal , in which he was joined by former U.S. Navy Chief Master-at-Arms Sean Cahill \u2013Cahill was involved in the famous USS Nimitz UFO encounters , and after making an appearance in the TTSA \u2019 s produced TV series Unidentified he is now partnering with Elizondo with a new company called Skyfort , which describes itself as a \u2018 strategic think tank \u2019 intended to offer intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether there was any evidence of \u2018 UAPs \u2019 ( the sanctioned acronym intended to sanitize the topic before mainstream media and the US Congress ) interacting with each other \u2013a way to enquire about whether there are signs of \u2018 conflict \u2019 between different types of unidentified aerial objects .\nInstead of alluding to any contemporary cases \u2013like for instance the controversial space shuttle footage from the 1990 \u2019 s , which is interpreted by some enthusiasts as signs of UFOs engaging in hostile maneuvers as some of them are entering Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss the kind of historical narratives that have been over-exploited by Giorgio Tsoukalos in the long-lived Ancient Aliens series on the History channel : the fascinating Nuremberg woodcut of 1561 showing all sorts of unusual celestial manifestations \u2013including what seems like spherical objects crashing down near a village\u2013 as well as the suggestive description of \u2018 vimanas \u2018 found in the Indian epic poems of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata .\nAnd then he spends a couple of minutes discussing some \u201c very interesting stones \u201d he had the opportunity to view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office in Lima , Peru ( whether he was there before , during or after his involvement with the AATIP program is unclear ) , and these stones to which he seems to give a lot of credence allegedly depict all sorts of incredible things like modern telescopes and even flying vehicles ( ! )\n.\nWatch video of the segment in which Elizondo discusses the \u2018 stones \u2019 .\nEven though he calls them \u201c Inca stones \u201d it is almost certain that what Elizondo was referring to in this interview are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which became very popular in Hispanic and Latin American esoteric circles in the mid 1970 \u2019 s after the publication of researcher Juan Jos\u00e9 Ben\u00edtez \u2019 s book \u201c Existi\u00f3 otra humanidad \u201d ( Another Humanity Existed ) which popularized these OOPARTs ( out of place artifacts ) allegedly excavated out of the Ica desert in Peru and said to be ten to twelve thousand years old , which purportedly showed not only imaginative descriptions of extremely advanced technology \u2013like for instance detailed open brain surgeries\u2013 but also ( and this is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes with primitive men and dinosaurs .\nIndeed , the kind of stuff any kid in the 1980s \u2013such as myself\u2013 dreamed about when they watched Hasbro \u2019 s TV commercials ( and subsequent cartoon series ) promoting their line of Dinoriders toys .\nJust as I confess that back in the 80s I was totally obsessed with the Dinorider toys ( C \u2019 mon , prehistoric beasts coupled with advanced tech ?\nwhat \u2019 s not to love ! )\nI must also shamefully confess that in the 90s I still remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which seemed to throw a monkey-wrench ( or rather , a dino-wrench ) on our orthodox concepts of ancient history .\nBut as time went on and my na\u00efve enthusiasm was eroded by the cold-hard facts that there is no conceivable way humans and dinosaurs could coexist on the same historic timeline \u2013as a Mexican , it took me a while to realize the fundamentalist Christian agenda pushing the OOPARTs purported to show man and dinosaurs walked the Earth before the deluge\u2013 I eventually came by enough documented evidence that showed without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a modern forgery : The imaginative work of the extravagant Dr. Javier Cabrera , a local physician who not only became the prime collector of the stones , but reportedly commissioned local artisans for many years to create them for his private museum \u2013some of those artisans not only confessed to the forgery to Spanish journalists , but analysis of photographs taken with a microscope showed traces of the color pencils said artisans used to trace the designs on the stones , proving they had been crafted in recent years .\nSpanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote an entire book about the subject , for those who are interested \u2013sadly , it has only been printed in Spanish .\nTo be fair , in the interview Elizondo leaves himself enough leeway in case the stones turned out to be fake ( which they are ) \u2014 \u201c Is that proof positive or evidence of anything ?\nNo .\nCould be someone \u2019 s wild imagination , y \u2019 know there \u2019 s lots of that out there .\nBut y \u2019 know could be something else , too \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article will be no doubt quick to point out \u2018 Big Lue \u2019 is not expected to be 100 % up-to-date with every single piece of research conducted with regards to UFOs or other mysteries .\nAnd yet I can not help but find ironic that it is those die-hard followers the same ones who continuously attack anyone who dares to vet or question Elizondo \u2019 s credentials and unsubstantiated claims , equating any sort of criticism as an obstacle in the golden road to the fabled Disclosure they long for .\nMeanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his inability to be taken seriously by people outside the small UFOlogical circles who celebrate him , and keeps admonishing the people in those circles to study philosophy and exercise their own critical thinking tools in order to take any story they find on the Internet with a grain of salt .\nBut what does it say about his own critical thinking ( or lack of curiosity ) when he stills considers the old Ica stones of the 1970s important enough to be mentioned in a public interview , knowing fully well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having an official endorsement of veracity ?\nHow will he succeed to convince the Mike Wests of the world who keep questioning the evidence he disclosed through To the Stars , and increase his circle influence outside the subculture of UFO aficionados who believe him unquestioningly , if he continuously keeps making mistakes such as showing an alleged image of the Washington UFO wave of 1952 as genuine photograph in front of an audience in Italy in 2018 , when any UFO researcher out there fully knows there are no real photos of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US capital that year ?\n* At the end of the day , I agree with Elizondo \u2019 s advice that advocates for Disclosure should do well in taking anything whistleblowers say with a healthy grain of salt , regardless of their past credentials .\nLest they want to make their movement as pass\u00e9 as an 80 \u2019 s line of dinosaur toys .\nSpecial thanks to Jos\u00e9 Antonio Caravaca and to Aleix de la Torre .\n( * ) Elizondo later recognized his mistake and jokingly alluded it to

"content": "Last weekend news began circulating over social media announcing the death of Betty Andreasson Luca ( nee Betty Waho ) ; a name that may not be instantly recognized outside the ( still fringe ) subculture of UFO aficionados , and yet thanks to the decades-long study of her numerous alleged close encounters with non-human entities \u2013the subject of several books written by Raymond E. Fowler , beginning with \u201c The Andreasson Affair \u201d ( 1979 ) \u2013 her story constitutes one of the most fascinating \u2013AND challenging\u2013 in the annals of UFOlogy .\nWhat makes Betty \u2019 s experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept the reality of UFOs , and even the possibility that what is currently known as the \u2018 alien abduction \u2019 experience is triggered by agencies outside the mind of abductees\u2013 is not just the fact that Betty \u2019 s accounts , which were mostly retrieved through a highly questionable use of hypnotic regression* , not only covered the whole gamut of details that became familiar to abduction research in the 80s and 90s \u2013 \u2018 missing time \u2019 , \u2018 Oz factor \u2019 , paralysis , non verbal ( telepathic ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical and gynecological procedures , insertions and removal of small \u2018 implants \u2019 and even the removal of \u2018 hybrid babies \u2019 \u2013 but that her purported recollections went far beyond what you would expect , if you were to interpret those aforementioned experiences as evidence of a highly advanced extraterrestrial race conducting genetic experiments with a sample of human families on a long-term basis .\nIndeed , the puzzling narration collected by Fowler under the course of several sessions with Betty in \u201c The Andreasson Affair , \u201d which focuses on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detonator which opened the floodgates to a whole lifetime of close encounter experiences\u2013 is nothing short of mystical : After 4 small \u2018 Grays \u2019 moving in single file who were wearing dark blue tight-fitting uniforms entered her home ( by way of passing through a solid wooden door ) asked her ( telepathically ) to come with them while the rest of the household \u2013Betty \u2019 s seven children , plus her two parents who were helping her out while her first husband was recuperating from a car crash in the hospital\u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animation \u2019 , she was transported ( without the need to physically walk ( ! )\n) to a circular metallic craft , and after all sorts of strange procedures she was taken to a ( never more adequately used ) alien realm where she ultimately was shown an allegorical vision of a giant phoenix-like glowing bird , which suddenly turned into a pile of ash from which a fat gray worm crawled out .\nAfter which a great booming voice told Betty that she had been chosen to carry a very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Andreasson Affair \u201d some years ago \u2013I was already familiar with the generalities of the story , but now I wanted to study the particulars\u2013 the thing that struck me the most was the deep ontological conflict between Betty \u2019 s personal interpretations of her own experiences , and that of the MUFON-affiliated group led by Fowler who was investigating her .\nThroughout all her life \u2013and I would assume until the very end\u2013 Betty held on to her deep Christian beliefs , and where Fowler and his associates were determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to Earth \u2019 ( pardon the pun ) extraterrestrial framework , to Betty all the signs and portents she was appointed to witness were a testament to God and his angels dutifully overwatching over Creation .\nEverything they were doing , the beings told Betty countless times , was done \u201c for the good of Man ; \u201d including the apparent manipulation of Betty \u2019 s recollection of the events , until the intelligences behind them deemed appropriate .\nIn chapter 12 of TAA it is described how Becky \u2013Betty \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in the experiences haunting her mother\u2013 developed the ability to fall into a trance and perform \u2018 automatic writing \u2019 at the age of 8 .\nThe strange symbols she would cover page after page with , Fowler mentions in passing , \u201c was found to be very similar to the so-called spirit writing practiced by the Shakers , an early American religious sect.\n\u201d The Shakers \u2013named thusly due to the ecstatic dances they would perform during religious ceremonies\u2013 are indeed a most peculiar Christian sect which originated in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1770s , establishing themselves in Massachussets \u2013where Betty Andreasson was born and lived until the late 1970s\u2013 among other places in the upper United States .\nThey practiced celibacy and held egalitarian views between genders , allowing women to hold leading positions in their communities like Mother Ann Lee , who was said to have had \u2018 the gift of spiritual revelation \u2019 .\nI saw in vision the Lord Jesus in his kingdom and glory .\nHe revealed to me the depth of man \u2019 s loss , what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefrom .\nThen I was able to bear an open testimony against the sin that is the root of all evil ; and I felt the power of God flow into my soul like a fountain of living water .\nFrom that day I have been able to take up a full cross against all the doleful works of the flesh .\nOne gets the feeling that , had Betty Andreasson lived in the early 19th century , she would have ended up being revered as another Shaker visionary .\nBut by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be coated with the veneer of technology \u2013the new religion\u2013 and Betty will remain relegated to the ill-fitting rank of \u2018 UFO abductee \u2019 for the time being .\nThere are a great deal of fascinating details involving Betty Andreasson \u2019 s experiences , and grabbing a copy of Raymond Fowler \u2019 s books \u2013despite my personal misgivings regarding his investigatory techniques and conclusions\u2013 is highly recommended .\n( * ) At the beginning on the investigation on her case Betty was hypnotized by behavioral psychologist Fred Max , but by the 1980s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team decided to train Bob Luca \u2013Betty \u2019 s second husband and a UFO abductee himself\u2013 on how to regress Betty to continue the sessions all by themselves without any supervision ;

Spotify ( and thus less videos on YouTube ) , one of his proteges of sorts has conversely been moving forward in leaps and bounds .\nThe Lex Fridman podcast , like JRE , is usually a one-on-one chat between the host and a guest \u2013 although , in this case , rather than a comedian/UFC jock , the host is an MIT computer scientist/AI researcher .\nFridman is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UFC/BJJ enthusiast\u2026and he also shares Joe Rogan \u2019 s interest in a number of the outre topics that we discuss here on the Grail , such as UFOs , and ideas that challenge the paradigm .\nAs such , it \u2019 s worth paying attention to his podcast both ( a ) as a great resource for interesting interviews on Grail-related topics , and ( b ) as a current cultural force spreading word about these ideas ( Fridman \u2019 s podcast episodes receive 1,000,000+ views on YouTube alone ) .\nOne such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a highly-credentialed/respected scientist from Stanford University with numerous patents to his name , who also has an interest in the study of anomalies .\nI recently wrote about a paper that Nolan and Jacques Vallee published on alleged materials ejected from UFOs , and we also previously covered his investigation of the \u2018 Atacama alien mummy \u2019 .\n( Nolan has also been established to be the eponymous \u2018 James \u2019 from Diana Walsh Pasulka \u2019 s American Cosmic : UFOs , Religion and Technology . )\nThe Fridman-Nolan discussion centres on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how Nolan \u2013 as a scientist \u2013 sees his role , and science in general , in engaging with these subjects and on the necessity of speculating and thinking outside the box .\nYou can view the interview below \u2013 but if you don \u2019 t have time to watch it in its entirety , I \u2019 ve also marked sections of interest and pulled out some quotes ( with approximate timestamps ) after the video embed .\n0:00 \u2013 The interview begins with a big \u2018 ridiculous \u2019 philosophical question from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is the most beautiful or fascinating aspect of human biology at the level of the human cell ?\n\u201d Nolan \u2019 s answer : \u201c The micro-machines and the nano-machines that proteins make and become \u2013 that to me is the most interesting .\nThe fact that you have this basically dynamic computer within every cell that \u2019 s constantly processing its environment .\nAnd at the heart of it is DNA which is a dynamic machine , a dynamic computation process people think of the dna as a linear code it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is the actually the epigenetic state that \u2019 s doing this amazing processing.\n\u201d \u201c I mean if you ever wanted to believe in God , \u201d Nolan says , \u201c just look inside the cell.\n\u201d Continues discussing DNA , and how it stores massive amounts of information .\n6:30 \u2013 Fridman asks \u201c How many alien civilisations do you think are out there ?\n\u201d Nolan : \u201c Innumerable .\nI would just be surprised \u2013 what a waste of all that space , just for us.\n\u201d Remembers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was young and thinking \u201c what kinds of empires have risen and fallen across that space that we \u2019 ll never know about , and isn \u2019 t that sad , to not know about something so grand.\n\u201d 8:00 \u2013 Nolan tells how he was/is inspired by ideas from science fiction , especially those writers who based their thoughts on evolution .\nMentions Larry Niven and David Brin as exemplars .\n10:45 \u2013 The UFO topic is introduced .\nFridman asks \u201c what is most fascinating to you about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\n\u201d Nolan answers : \u201c The uniformity of the stories.\n\u201d Nolan offers an excellent caveat before beginning his discussion on the UFO topic , touching on being clear that speculation is important and does not equate to belief .\n12:30 \u2013 Nolan says he is fascinated with UFO cases that include messages about ecological collapse .\nMentions Zimbabwe school children contact story .\nFridman asks \u201c Did it actually happen ?\n\u201d Nolan replies ( around 16:20 ) : \u201d I think they saw what they said they saw .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shown.\n\u201d 17:30 \u2013 Nolan on extraterrestrials possibly being here , but disguising themselves and just guiding rather than appearing .\n\u201c I think that like any good parent you don \u2019 t tell your student everything .\nYou make them learn and learning requires mistakes because if you tell them everything then they get lazy \u201d .\n18:00 \u2013 Discussion turns to his analysis of the brains of people who had UFO encounters .\nNolan ( somewhat curiously ) says the research actually began with individuals who appear to have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves on to the claims made in the UFO community that the research identified anomalies in the brains of those who see UFOs : Nolan then goes on to outline how this might be restricted to certain individuals through genetics , and says of the \u2018 ability \u2019 that \u201c if intuition is the ability to see something that other people don \u2019 t \u2013 and I don \u2019 t mean that in a paranormal sense , but being able to see something just in front of you that other people might just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a function of a higher kind of intelligence , to say well\u2026I \u2019 m not looking at something that I should just ignore , I \u2019 m seeing something and I recognize it for not what it is but that it is something different than is normally found in my environment \u201d .\nFridman identifies with this idea , noting \u201c some people are probably more receptive to anomalous information \u2013 they see the magic , the possibility in the novel thing\u2026some people are more , \u2018 wait a minute this is kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those people probably become scientists too .\nLike there \u2019 s this pattern happening over and over and over and then something weird just happened and then you get excited by that weirdness and start to pull the string and discover what is at the core of that weirdness \u201d .\n27:30 \u2013 Nolan notes how different witnesses to UFO sightings often see different things , \u201c almost as if whatever it is , is projecting something into the mind , rather than it being a real manifestation , material , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fridman puts forward an interesting thought about advanced intelligences possibly having ways to overlay an augmented reality of sorts on experiencers .\nNolan then riffs on this .\n33:00 \u2013 Question about ( Tic-Tac UFO witness ) David Fravor .\nNolan notes that he \u2019 s friends with Fravor and many others involved in the recent UFO releases , including Lue Elizondo and Chris Mellon : \u201c I saw the videos about three weeks or so before they went public , \u201d he tells Fridman .\n\u201c I was at a bar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they showed them to me , and my hair stood on end .\nHe said \u2018 this is coming out soon \u2019 .\nAnd I know one of the guys on the inside who was the Naval Intelligence who had interviewed all these pilots\u2026it was hair-raising.\n\u201d 34:45 \u2013 Fridman offers some excellent thoughts on why we should engage with anomalies in science : Nolan chimes in : \u201c If it only stimulates [ people to ask those questions , e.g .\nhow UFOs move like that ] \u2026 \u201d Fridman finishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s a powerful way to think \u2018 what is possible \u2019 , it \u2019 s inspiring .\nEven if some of the data doesn \u2019 t represent ET craft\u2026considering the possibility of these things opens up your mind in a way that ultimately can create the technology .\nFirst you have to believe the technology is possible before you can create it.\n\u201d Nolan comments that this process is exactly what happens in his lab all the time , creating instruments/tech based on what new area he needs to explore .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half dozen or more companies on that basic premise.\n\u201d 40:10 \u2013 Nolan : \u201c As I \u2019 ve said before , alien means alien .\nNot Hollywood aliens , but a whole different way of thinking and a whole different level of experience.\n\u201d 45:30 \u2013 Discussion of the difficulties in advanced aliens communicating concepts to us .\nFridman compares advanced aliens trying to communicate concepts with us , with \u201c talking to the ants about Instagram .\n\u2018 You want to look good in this picture , let me explain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracks Fridman up .\nNolan expands on this thought : \u201c You could see how religions would call them angels or devils or what-have-you , because if you \u2019 re trying to fit it into the framework of cultural understanding the first thing you reach for is God.\n\u201d 47:45 \u2013 Discussion turns to Nolan \u2019 s scientific analysis of Steven Greer \u2019 s \u2018 Atacama alien \u2019 skeleton .\n\u201c I went into it originally thinking it was a monkey , \u201d Nolan confesses .\nNolan notes that this investigation was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c You go to an expert when it \u2019 s outside your field of interest , \u201d he says .\n51:00 \u2013 Nolan tells of the pushback he got from true believers when the results showed that the skeleton was human .\n\u201c The sad part about it was individuals in the UFO community who wanted to think it was some sort of conspiracy around it \u2013 somebody had somehow convinced all of my students to lie .\nI mean , c \u2019 mon.\n\u201d Nolan then expands on the relationship between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anomalies : \u201c There \u2019 s a bigger story here , which is : there \u2019 s a hunger in the populace to discover something anomalous , something new \u2013 and science has to be both open to the anomalous but also to reject the anomalous when the data doesn \u2019 t support it.\n\u201d 53:15 \u2013 Also discusses the \u2018 Starchild skull \u2019 , which Nolan after looking at the DNA sequencing also determined to be human .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not about debunking , it \u2019 s about getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s usually the most extravagant things that are most likely to be wrong .\nSomewhere in the rubble will be something interesting\u2026so that \u2019 s what you do , you get the dross off the table.\n\u201d 55:00 \u2013 Fridman brings up Nolan \u2019 s research on materials alleged to be from UFOs : \u201c You \u2019 ve also looked at UFO materials .\nYou \u2019 re in possession of UFO materials yourself.\n\u201d Nolan is quick to clarify : \u201c Claimed UFO materials .\nAlleged.\n\u201d 1:03:00 \u2013 Discusses the material from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades since that case , Nolan notes jokingly that if the materials are a hoax , it \u2019 s definitely a \u201c long term troll \u201d .\nHe goes on to note that any analysis of the materials can \u2019 t be considered hard evidence for alien craft , but that the analysis is still worthwhile as an initial step : \u201c Is this sufficient evidence ?\nAbsolutely not .\nBut somebody \u2019 s put it forward , I have the time , it \u2019 s my time , I \u2019 ll study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of take those that I think are credible enough and do a reasonable analysis , put it out there and maybe somebody else will come up with an idea as to what it is.\n\u201d Fridman : \u201c Again I think showing up with technology that we humans would find completely novel is actually a really difficult task for aliens because it obviously can \u2019 t be so novel that we don \u2019 t recognize it for what it is .\nSo I would say most the technology aliens likely have would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s actually a hard problem how to convince ants , like you first have to understand what ants are tweeting about , like what they care about , in order to inject into their culture.\n\u201d 1:06:15 \u2013 Discussion of Jacques Vallee .\nNolan notes that \u201c the first thing that I learned from him is this notion of what he called kabuki theater\u2026I remember reading his books and thinking he uses this word \u2018 absurd \u2019 a lot .\nHe said the the things that people claim they see are absurd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land in a farmer \u2019 s field and then [ an alien ] come up and knock on the door and say \u2018 can I have a glass of water ?\n\u2019 \u2026it \u2019 s absurd.\n\u201d \u201c So he says this is put on as a show \u2013 it \u2019 s an influence campaign , right ?\nIt \u2019 s not meant to influence individuals , it \u2019 s meant to influence a culture as a whole.\n\u201d 1:11:00 \u2013 Thoughts on last year \u2019 s government report on UFOs .\nNolan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful\u2026the adults are finally stepping up and being in charge\u2026I think it was an important sea-change in the internal discussions going on in the government.\n\u201d 1:14:00 \u2013 Some discussion about the need for wide scale data collection on UFOs , an order of magnitude beyond what we currently do .\nFridman notes though that the easiest way to do that is to make it a defence issue , but that comes with drawbacks : \u201c If you make it about \u2018 what are the Russians , what are the Chinese doing ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question of geopolitics , it gets touchy , because now you \u2019 re kind of taken away from the realm of science and making it military\u2026 This is what makes me as an engineer truly sad \u2013 that some of the greatest engineering work ever done is by Lockheed Martin , and we will never know about it.\n\u201d 1:21:30 \u2013 Fridman asks a question about the government having something even more impressive \u201c of extraterrestrial origin \u201d in their possession .\nNolan says \u201c I \u2019 ve not seen anything personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who I don \u2019 t think can lie , then\u2026yes.\n\u201d Some discussion of government secrecy on the UFO topic follows .\n1:26:00 \u2013 Does he believe the Bob Lazar story ?\nNolan : \u201c I don \u2019 t believe in the Bob Lazar story to be quite honest.\n\u201d Nolan goes on to note that he prefers looking at cases that have data or material he can analyze , rather than historical stories : 1:29:00 \u2013 Discussion turns to Avi Loeb and the mystery of \u2018 Oumuamua \u2019 .\nNolan notes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s \u2018 Galileo Project \u2018 .\n1:33:00 \u2013 Fridman asks Nolan what advice he would give to young scientists about researching things outside the mainstream .\nNolan replies , \u201c if you believe in something , you believe that an idea is valuable , or you haven \u2019 t approached something , don \u2019 t let others shame you into not doing it .\nAs I \u2019 ve said , shame is a societal control device to get other people to do what they want you to do , rather than what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c I just point to my successes\u2026I reverse shame them .\n\u201d", "author": "Greg", "url":

the Invisible Visible: The Archives of the Impossible Conference (March 3-6, 2022)", "content": "That is how Professor Jeffrey Kripal chose to inaugurate the Archives of the Impossible Conference on March 3rd at Rice University in Houston , Texas , where scholars and laypeople from all walks of life gathered for this unprecedented event .\nAnd in truth Kripal \u2019 s words may seem farfetched , but the goal of the movement he and his colleagues are starting \u2013if successful\u2013 would be no small feat if they manage to change one iota in the traditional posture of Academia , when confronted with experiences and events we currently store under the daunting label of \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only academics who paid attention to such things ( from a very safe distance ) regarded them as folklore or psychological delusions , and the rest chose to frown upon and look the other way when asked about things like UFO sightings , ghost apparitions or psychic phenomena .\n\u201c It \u2019 s impossible , ergo it can \u2019 t be \u201d they would pedantically answer as they resumed writing their grant application seeking to get fundings for research in a well-trodden avenue of human knowledge , while steering clear of the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests of the unexplained .\nKripal & Co. \u2019 s response : Yes , it is impossible .\nAnd yet it is real\u2026 so what do we do about it ?\nWhat they and others are bravely proposing , is that it is high time universities and higher centers of learning get their heads out of the sand and deal with these enigmas that ruthlessly challenge our understanding of reality once and for all , lest they keep fostering an information vacuum which is always eventually filled by charlatans or well-intentioned amateurs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief systems rather than conducting a useful search for the truth .\nHere be monsters , fellow travelers , so better to arm yourselves with a good roadmap and a compass before venturing into the wild .\nWhat sort of roadmap , would you ask ?\nWell , that \u2019 s where Kripal \u2019 s brainchild comes in : During a casual conversation with Dr. Jacques Vallee \u2013one of the subjects of his book Authors of the Impossible who has become a close friend of Jeff \u2019 s ever since\u2013 the celebrated investigator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his massive archive of files and research notes he \u2019 s gathered in close to half a century of searching for an answer to the UFO enigma ( an answer he \u2019 s humble enough to recognize it has eluded him yet ) .\nIt is an all-too-common curse in the quest for understanding these forbidden topics that , once the researcher dies , their relatives or surviving spouses simply toss all their books and case files that took them a lifetime to gather into the trash bin .\nThus , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build a library of Alexandria out of sand .\nIf this were the subject of a comic book then the artist might have drawn a proverbial light bulb turning on above Kripal \u2019 s head right at the moment he listened to Vallee \u2019 s bemoans ; a few months and dozens phone calls later ( or in our allegory just a transition panel ) Kripal had managed to convince his superiors at Rice University to store and archive Vallee \u2019 s files in perpetuity at Fondren Library .\nNot only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others on board who have graciously donated their papers and other invaluable research materials to Rice , making them available to the public thanks to the enthusiastic help of dozens of grad students in charge of cataloguing these mountains of material \u2013much of which is still waiting to be parsed and processed* .\nNow , after years of careful archival work , interested researchers will be able to peruse through the thousands of letters received by Anne and Whitley Strieber after the publication of Communion ; the careful scrutiny of which forced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has more to do with the afterlife , than with little green men visiting our world from other planets .\nThey will also be able to study Ed May \u2019 s papers on remote viewing and the Stargate project at SRI \u2013a subject that it is still deeply controversial and divisive , even among people who are not skeptical to paranormal topics\u2013 or Stanley Krippner \u2019 s parapsychological publications archive .\nAll this , along with Vallee \u2019 s collection , is but a fraction of what it is currently stored at Fondren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conference was thus designed to commemorate the public opening of these collections with 3 days of roundtables and plenary presentations given by some of the same people who have donated their papers to Rice .\nThe webpage designed by the University is now hosting all the recorded sessions and I urge everyone to check them out .\nHere is for example Vallee \u2019 s presentation given right after Kripal \u2019 s inaugural speech , in which he nonchalantly shoots down the illusion that hard materialist sciences can reveal the ultimate truths of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should instead have faith in the power of new ideas : And here is my personal favorite , given by Chicano author John Phillip Santos about the importance of borderlands ( both physical and sociological ) when dealing with the paranormal : At the end of the conference , Kripal gave one final admonition to the audience : \u201c Go forth !\nConfuse the world !\n\u201d And in truth many people will scratch their heads at what these piles of yellowing papers and deteriorating tapes really mean .\nThey certainly won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardcore skeptics who will cry on their deathbeds that ESP and all of this \u2018 woo \u2019 is a bunch of poppycock .\nBut if the Archives of the Impossible manage to open up an honest and open-minded dialogue between those who have devoted their lives studying these \u2018 damned events \u2019 \u2013to use an appropriate Fortean terminology\u2013 and those in academic circles who \u2019 ve always had a secret interesting in these subjects \u2013just like Vallee \u2019 s colleagues in the 70 \u2019 s\u2013 then we will manage to enter a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ultimate solution to these mysteries , but that at least will allow us to look for the answers out in the daylight , instead of hiding in the shadows for fear of ridicule .\nHere \u2019 s to the end of Invisible Colleges .\n( * ) Jacques Vallee \u2019 s collection , while being the first to be admitted to the Archives of the Impossible , will also be the last to be fully accessible to the public because the files have

"title": "Strange Lights and Sacred Sites: Were ancient monuments built at locations associated with anomalous light phenomena?", "content": "My curiosity regarding the relationship between the earth , seismic activity and strange lights was piqued in 1957 , when I was a schoolboy in Leicestershire in central England .\nIn that year and county there was a significant earthquake , in which I saw the school walls bulge ( but fortunately not collapse ) .\nA teacher who had taken a school party out on a field trip to nearby Charnwood Forest \u2013 a dramatic , fault-ridden and ancient upland landscape where later Triassic sediments sit directly on top of Precambrian rocks \u2013 stated that he and the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing the sky just before the quake struck .\nIt was no accident , then , that many years later a colleague and I chose to conduct an investigation of reports spanning a few centuries telling of strange phenomena , including curious lights , in our home county .\nIt formed a two-part article entitled \u2018 Portrait of a Fault Area \u2019 ( Devereux and York 1975 ) .\nAlthough fairly primitive , this geographical study nevertheless clearly indicated that over the centuries modern \u2018 UFOs \u2019 ( as the current fashion has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light \u201d or \u201c meteors \u201d in Leicestershire shared a common distribution with faulting , seismic activity and unusual meteorology .\nOne of the earliest modern investigators to raise awareness of such \u2018 earth lights \u2019 was the American , Charles Fort .\nIn assembling his compendious record of unusual events , Fort began to spy possible connections that virtually no one before him had the range of data or wit to perceive .\nHe linked strange aerial lights with earthquakes , predating modern geological confirmation of \u2018 earthquake lights \u2019 ( EQLs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to the December 1896 earthquake in the Hereford \u2013 Worcester region of Britain ( Fort 1923 ) .\nHe found reports describing such effects as \u201c a great blaze \u201d in the sky and a flying \u201c luminous object \u201d coincident with the quake .\nFort acidly commented that \u201c the conventional scientist \u201d of his day had a \u201c reluctance toward considering shocks of this earth and phenomena in the sky at the same time \u201d .\nExcerpted from Paul Devereux \u2019 s The Powers of Ancient and Sacred Places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or your favourite online bookseller .\nJohn Keel , a later but similarly far-sighted American writer , came to the conclusion that \u2018 UFOs \u2019 were more likely to be \u201c soft \u201d lightforms than \u201c hard \u201d metallic craft .\nAs early as the 1960s , he was associating their appearance with areas ( \u201c windows \u201d ) of geological faulting , earthquakes and geomagnetic anomaly .\nIn France at about the same time , Ferdinand Lagarde was also noticing a significant correlation between reported \u2018 UFOs \u2019 and geological faulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solely to this approach within ufology at this time , American author Vincent H. Gaddis published Mysterious Fires and Lights ( 1967 ) , which had chapters such as \u201c Earth \u2019 s Glowing Ghosts \u201d .\nHistorical literature has revealed that people from all cultures and times have seen unexplained light phenomena ( Devereux 1982 , 1989 ) .\nTo the Irish they were fairy lights , to the Scots they were simply gealbhan ( balls of fire ) , to Malaysians , pennangal ( the spectral heads of women who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were local deities or the lanterns of spirits , to Africans they were devil lights , to Brazilians the \u201c Mother of Gold \u201d leading to buried treasure , to Chinese Buddhists they were Bodhisattva Lights .\n( The Indians and Chinese sometimes built temples where lights appeared with some regularity . )\nEuropeans visiting some of these lands also reported seeing strange lights \u2013 they were not just local lore .\nOn a visit to Gabon in 1895 , for instance , the writer Mary Kingsley saw a ball of violet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banks of Lake Ncovi ; it hovered until joined by another , similar light .\nThe two lightballs circled each other until Kingsley approached them in a canoe .\nOne then flew off back into the trees while the other floated over the lake surface .\nAs Kingsley paddled quickly after it , it went down into the water , still glowing as it sank .\nLocals later told her such phenomena were aku , devil lights .\nIn Europe there had been debate about unexplained lights from at least the medieval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular myth today is that unidentified aerial phenomena ( UAP ) are extra-terrestrial craft , then it was that they were dragons .\nBut some questioned this .\nIn the 13th Century , for example , Albertus Magnus said the \u201c dragons \u201d were in actuality \u201c vapours \u201d that could roll into a ball and float up and down .\nIn 1590 , Thomas Hill said they were \u201c fumes kindled \u201d giving the simulacrum of a flying dragon .\nIn 1608 , Edward Topskell argued that \u201c dragons \u201d were really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere are also early modern reports from Britain , such as the account given in his Journal of 1830 by the \u201c peasant poet \u201d , John Clare .\nHe told how he encountered a lightball while walking one evening between the villages of Ashton and Helpston in Cambridgeshire .\nThe light came towards him .\n\u201c I thought it made a sudden stop as if to listen to me , \u201d he wrote .\nIt crackled and was surrounded by a luminous halo : Clare described the light as having \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it darted away Clare promptly took to his heels .\nHe already knew that there was locally \u201c a great upstir \u201d about the lights , with up to fifteen at a time being seen over Deadmoor and Eastwell Moor flying back and forth , both with and against the wind .\nClare said that his close encounter robbed him of \u201c the little philosophical reasoning \u201d he had about them .\nIn 1977 , Michael Persinger and Gyslaine Lafreni\u00e8re published Space-Time Transients and Unusual Events .\nUsing a statistical approach , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c seismic-related sources \u201d .\nThey argued that the enormous energies built up in tectonic strain , even without actual release in earthquakes , were sufficient to produce glowing , ionised , lightforms in the atmosphere above such areas .\nBodies of water , especially reservoirs , could also produce strain on underlying geology .\nOver subsequent years , Persinger and the U.S. geologist John Derr , together and individually , examined specific \u201c windows \u201d of recurring reported light phenomena , and amassed an impressive body of data to support this \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study was of the Yakima Indian reservation in Washington State , USA , where , in the 1970s , fire wardens in lookout posts observed and photographed a range of unusual light phenomena ( along with weird ground-based poltergeist-type happenings ) .\nThey saw large orange-coloured lightballs , smaller \u201c ping-pong \u201d balls of light , luminous columns and flares , and white lights with smaller , multi-coloured lights apparently connected to them .\nGlowing clouds and flashes in the sky were also noted .\nDerr and Persinger showed that three-quarters of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vicinity of faulted ridges and they correlated outbreaks of the lights with seismic activity .\nAnother area where nature similarly lent researchers a hand is the Hessdalen valley near Trondheim , Norway .\nFrom late 1981 , local people saw lights spring into visibility near rooftops , or hover just below the summits and ridges of the surrounding mountains .\nThe lightforms included spheres and inverted \u201c \u2019 bullet \u201d and \u201c Christmas tree \u201d shapes .\nColours were mainly white or yellow-white , though small , flashing red lights on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were also reported .\nStrong , localised white or blue flashes in the sky were also observed .\nAll rather similar to Yakima .\nIn 1984 , a group of researchers formed \u201c Project Hessdalen \u201d and conducted monitoring in Hessdalen using radar , magnetometers , spectrum analysers and other instrumentation .\nThe group conducted further sessions in 1985 and 1986 .\nMany photographs ( some sequential ) were taken of the lights , and radar anomalies were recorded .\nAround a decade later a new Project Hessdalen was inaugurated using more sophisticated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Erling Strand , it is still operating and real-time observation can be conducted from anyone \u2019 s laptop by linking to their automatic station ( www.hessdalen.org ) .\nIn 1980 , Kevin and Sue McClure published Stars and Rumours of Stars , a thorough account of reported light phenomena in the Barmouth-Harlech area of north-west coastal Wales in 1904-1905 .\nBeriah Evans , a local journalist of the time , published accounts of witnesses \u2019 sightings , including his own : \u201c Between us and the hills there suddenly flashed forth an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole circumference dazzling sparklets like flashing rays from a diamond \u2026 \u201d .\nGlittering diamond-shapes were seen on roofs , \u201c bottle-shaped \u201d lights hung over hilltops , ruby-red lights popped out of the ground , rose into the air and fused together , and columns of light emerged from the ground .\nLondon newsmen from the national daily papers who visited to report on the kerfuffle lost their initial cynicism when they saw the lights for themselves .\nThe Daily Mail correspondent saw yellow balls of light of \u201c electric vividness \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barmouth-Harlech road .\nA Daily Mirror journalist found himself engulfed in a \u201c soft , shimmering radiance \u201d .\nLooking up , he saw \u201c a large body \u201d overhead that had \u201c suddenly opened and emitted a flood of light from within itself \u201d .\nAs many of the reports contained location details , it seemed to me that this Welsh outbreak would be worth testing for geological links .\nSo I teamed up with our Dragon Project geological adviser , Paul McCartney .\nIt was our good fortune that a recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , enabling us to correlate exact sighting information with exact faulting information .\nIt was found that there is the deep-rooted Mochras Fault almost linking Barmouth and Harlech , and that most of the lights events were strung out along it like scintillating beads on a thread .\nSome sightings occurred off the main fault , but these were associated with tributary faulting .\nNo reported light phenomenon occurred further than 700m ( 765 yards ) from a fault , and incidence increased with proximity to faulting so that most events occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faulting .\nIndeed , some lights emerged directly out of the Mochras Fault .\nFurther , it was found that the Welsh events began immediately after a local earthquake ( in October , 1904 ) .\nAlthough this particular outbreak was an exceptional event in the area , the lights still appear occasionally .\nHarlech is adjacent to the Lleyn Peninsula , one of Britain \u2019 s most active seismic zones .\nIn 1984 , it was the epicentre of a significant ( 5.5 Richter-scale ) earthquake .\nA local resident told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a brilliant white light \u201c the size of a small car \u201d float in from the sea and disappear into sand dunes .\nIn 1982 , I published Earth Lights ( with Paul McCartney ) .\nIt was heavily attacked by UFO enthusiasts of an extra-terrestrial persuasion , and even by normally more reasonable researchers who hadn \u2019 t quite got their heads around this \u2018 new \u2019 approach to anomalous aerial lights .\nIn the same year , academic Helmut Tributsch published When the Snakes Awake , in which he recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in association with earthquakes .\nThe following year author Jenny Randles cited earth lights , or what she called unidentified aerial phenomena ( UAP ) sightings and made tectonic associations in her The Pennine UFO Mystery .\nIn 1985 , David Clarke and Granville Oldroyd published Spooklights \u2013 A British Survey .\nOne of its well-documented UAP haunts was at Burton Dassett , in south Warwickshire , the focus of outbreaks of light phenomena in 1922 and 1923 .\nA reporter from the Birmingham Post , among other witnesses , saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few feet above the ground .\nClarke and Oldroyd discovered that the location sits directly on the Burton Dassett fault , and that the mysterious light briefly reappeared on the night of 25 January , 1924 .\nThat very night , there was a powerful earth tremor around Hereford , 60 miles ( 97km ) to the west .\nThis tectonic coincidence was noted by the local Leamington Chronicle at the time .\n( This was a year after Fort had published his observations of apparent links between aerial lights and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I published Earth Lights Revelation .\nIt included a section by David Clarke and Andy Roberts on Project Pennine , their study of the hill and moorland country running along the spine of England , an effort in which they were assisted by numerous other researchers .\nA geography of light-haunted moors , hills , valleys and reservoirs was mapped by the project , and phenomena described that ranged from balls of light to glowing hillsides .\nClarke and Roberts expanded on this work in their Phantoms of the Sky ( 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aegis of the then Princeton-based International Consciousness Research Laboratories ( ICRL ) , I was able to conduct some field expeditions with my wife Charla Devereux , another member of ICRL .\nWe included a few of what in America are called \u201c spook light \u201d locations .\nThese typically involve extremely long straight sections of road or former railroad corridors cutting through forests .\nThe spook lights we investigated turned out to be distorted glimpses of distant vehicle headlights .\nWe paid two field visits to the famed \u2018 Marfa lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with the quantum physicist , Hal Puthoff .\nThis turned out to be more complex .\nWe conclusively showed that most of what people think are the Marfa lights seen from a designated viewing point are in fact distorted car headlights , 40 miles ( 64km ) away , on the road going south to Presidio , or closer vehicles negotiating tracks leading to ranches out on the range , giving the appearance of lights dancing back and forth just above the slightly undulating ground .\nBut there are reports of strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dating back to the 17th Century , and witnesses ( including priests and teachers ) we interviewed reported close encounters with spheres of lights .\nAn \u2018 active \u2019 area was seemingly the Chisos Mountains to the south of Marfa .\nThere , I personally witnessed an anomalous light but it flickered out before photographs could be taken .\nFinally , Erling Strand of Project Hessdalen and I investigated reported \u201c min-min lights \u201d in the remote Kimberley region of Australia .\nWe gained insights from Indigenous Australians , and witnessed at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shimmering fan of golden light emerging soundlessly and momentarily from the desert surface ) .\nWe managed to film only one of them , though \u2013 a moving white light that appeared as our magnetometer registered a strong geomagnetic reading \u2013 we identified this as relating to a powerful earthquake 800 miles away , so either that triggered the appearance of the light via geoelectrical changes , or it was a remarkable coincidence .\nSome of these exploits , among others , were the subject of a 1996 Channel 4 documentary on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-titled Earth Lights for Discovery Channel ) .\nIt screened in November and marked an extraordinary coincidence that Fort would have hugely enjoyed : within twenty-four hours of transmission people began reporting bizarre light phenomena in Cornwall .\nThere were soft , silent nocturnal luminous displays , rectangles of light moving jerkily through the heavens , and moon-like spheres that slowly dissolved .\nIt went on all week , at the end of which Cornwall experienced its strongest earthquake of the century .\n( There \u2019 s nothing like having Mother Earth as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were later logged by a member of the British Geological Survey .\nIn 1997 , Peter Brookesmith and I co-authored UFOs and Ufology , in which we tried to sort out all the strands that intertwined in the scene formerly known as \u2018 ufology \u2019 , including earth lights research and \u201c alien abductions \u201d ( an altered state of consciousness issue , we decided , not an extra-terrestrial one ) .\nIt was welcomed by genuine researchers but rubbished by diehard extra-terrestrial believers .\nWhile most reported sightings of strange aerial phenomena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mundane objects , artificial or astronomical , or else mirage effects , hoaxes , or psychosocial factors affecting a witness \u2019 s interpretation of a perception , there can be little doubt that there is a rump of reports that relates to genuinely unexplained luminous phenomena .\nIt is at least a percentage of these core sightings that I think is comprised of earth lights , mystery lights , anomalous luminescences , or whatever we choose to call them .\nThese light phenomena seem to have electro-magnetic ( EM ) properties \u2013 Persinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields that can trigger hallucinations and trance states in close witnesses .\nAlso , there are accounts of poltergeist-like events accompanying some outbreaks of light phenomena ( such as at Yakima ) with objects flying around , door latches moving of their own accord , and gravel crunching as if trod by ghostly feet .\nInterestingly , similar effects have been occasionally noted during particularly vivid aurorae events ( Grant 1984 ibid . )\nSo , overall , the association of unusual light phenomena and geological faulting is fairly well established by various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights were noted by past peoples and given explanations that were culturally relevant to their times .\nThis , as documented in The Powers of Ancient and Sacred Places ( available from Amazon US or Amazon UK ) , seemingly included the building of monuments where lights were seen .\nTake , for example , Castlerigg Stone Circle , in Cumbria , England .\nSituated about a mile east of the town of Keswick in the Lake District of England , the siting of this magnificent stone circle is amongst the most impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of rugged Lakeland hills .\nThe site itself is well preserved , with its stones forming a flattened circle 33.5m ( 110ft ) across its longest diameter .\nInside the main ring of stones is a mysterious rectangular setting of up to ten stones , often referred to as \u2018 The Cove \u2019 .\nA gap flanked by two large stones in the northern arc of the circle was probably an original entrance .\nIn all , there are thirty-eight surviving stones at the site , the heaviest weighing around fifteen tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dragon Project ( see The Powers of Ancient and Sacred Places for more on the Dragon Project ) , all the Castlerigg stones were checked for any magnetic anomalies with liquid-filled compasses .\nOnly one of the thirty-eight stones affected the compass needle : the leaning westernmost stone .\nIt \u2019 s inwards-facing side strongly deflects a compass needle in one area , and attracts it in another .\nBut the main reported \u2018 energy \u2019 interest relating to this site occurred in the early years of the 20th Century .\nWriting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1919 , a Mr T. Sington described an experience he and an acquaintance had around Easter time some years earlier .\nThe two men were returning to their hotel in Keswick in darkness , after an ascent of Helvellyn .\nHere is Sington \u2019 s account : Sington concluded his account by wondering why the site of the stone circle had been selected .\n\u201c Suppose , owing to some local condition at present unknown , \u201d he mused , \u201c such lights have occurred from time to time near the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the inhabitants , who , awestruck , would have attached great significance to them , and might then have selected the site as a place of worship or sacrifice.\n\u201d So , for his time , Sington \u2019 s thinking was remarkably perceptive .\nExcerpted from Paul Devereux \u2019 s The Powers of

the Mystery of Crank Caverns", "content": "Since 2019 , I \u2019 ve been lucky enough to have been a contributor to Hellebore Zine .\nCurrently in its sixth bi-annual issue , Hellebore is a collection of writings and essays devoted to British folk horror , its themes and inspirations .\nIn 2020 , I was asked to contribute to The Hellebore Guide to Occult Britain : an illustrated travel guide covering the history of magic and the occult in the UK .\nI researched and wrote content for the North West and North East sections of the book .\nSome of the ground I covered was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not so much .\nOf all the legends and locations I read and wrote about however , one has stuck with me .\nA nagging fascination for this place has remained , intensified even , in the time between my setting down a few hundred words on it for The Hellebore Guide and now .\nWhich is why , today , I \u2019 ve decided that it \u2019 s time for me to dig back into my research and share it with you .\nIt all began as simply as this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across a weird place name .\nCrank ( formerly Grank and , in the 13th century , Gronk ) is a small village in Merseyside , England , near the slightly larger village of Rainford , in the Metropolitan Borough of St Helens .\nCrank , it turns out , is about 15 miles ( 24 km ) North East from my own home .\nThe Rainford Delph Quarry was a sandstone quarry near Crank , in use from the mid-1700s until the early 20th century .\nExcavated at multiple levels , mines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunnels in several places .\nThis now long-abandoned network of tunnels is known locally as Crank Caverns .\nA wealth of folklore has grown up around the caverns , or perhaps more accurately , has emerged from within them .\nSo , what is strange about Crank Caverns ?\nI \u2019 ll quote from my own short entry on them from The Hellebore Guide : These seventy words represent both my jumping off point , and my ultimate , word-count restricted , distillation of all that I uncovered .\nThere was much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , confusing , and , as is often the case with folklore and Urban Legend , contradictory .\nThere was no room to tell it .\nNo time to explore any of it in depth .\nSo , now , let \u2019 s make room , and take time .\nLet \u2019 s explore these weird caverns in depth .\nVia the remote safety of words on a screen , of course .\nMy years of researching odd little bits of local folklore and history have taught me a few tricks to uncover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of which is this : always check with the local library .\nSo , in January 2021 , I browsed St Helens Library \u2019 s online archive , and then dropped them an email .\nA week or two later I received a reply : A few days on , I received a collection of photocopied documents , one of which was an amateur expedition report dated , as the librarian had said , from 1938 , having been published in the St Helens Reporter newspaper .\nThis was a first-hand account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degraded through copying that they were all but black \u2013 from a group who had recently visited Crank Caverns .\nThe reporter recorded that the team found the caverns overgrown and wholly abandoned when they arrived .\nThree prospective entrances were soon discovered to be blocked by cave-ins and debris , but eventually they dug through some looser rubble and found a small , narrow tunnel .\nThis hole proved to lead into a tunnel below , which the men proceeded to drop down into .\nFor more than half an hour they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSome so low they were forced to stoop or crawl , some whose high ceilings were timbered with rotting beams .\nMany of the entrances to further tunnels had been sealed with now immovable stone blocks , quarried therein .\nThey saw stalactites and stalagmites , stone walls covered with a \u201c smooth phosphorescent precipitate of calcite \u201d , and discovered one passage which they assumed to have been natural , rather than man-made .\nThe twine proved an effective means of navigation and , after another half hour \u2019 s journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the open-air .\n\u201c [ W ] ith scarred hands and arms \u201d , but otherwise unscathed .\nThe piece concludes : The next piece of this photocopied jigsaw comes in the form of a kind of rebuttal to this first report .\nAgain , in the St Helens Reporter , the piece entitled \u2018 Man Who Worked in Crank Caverns \u2013 He Clears up Some Mysteries \u2019 , was published two weeks after the 1938 expedition piece .\nThe interviewee is a Mr Rigby , \u201c an alert man of 82 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having been born \u201c next to the old chapel at Crank \u201d in 1855 .\nMr Rigby started work as a mason at the age of thirteen , and the stone he worked came from Crank Caverns .\nStone from the quarry was , he reported , put to a great many uses , from pavements to gravestones .\nAs to the strange , labyrinthine passageways the previous report had thought to be anomalous : Most of the interview takes the form of the kind of \u2018 Reminiscences of an old Gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers for many years Mr Rigby explaining to the modern newspapermen how different life used to be back in the Old Days .\nOne interesting and relevant point made though , was how many abandoned , forgotten , and repurposed tunnels this old gentleman knew of in the local area .\nWhat is particularly interesting to me about these two reports is the fact that , even though someone with first-hand knowledge of the caverns and their purpose was still living at the time , they had already passed into the realm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is worth pointing out that in 1938 , the average UK life expectancy was 61 years .\nSo , while Mr Rigby was certainly not the oldest British man alive at the time , he was definitely an outlier .\nOne of very few who could remember , and recount what they knew of Crank Caverns , and of the many other lost workings which riddled the ground beneath the area .\nThe original reporter claimed to have \u201c searched records going back several centuries , but there was no mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked it \u201d .\nMy own research came to similar conclusions \u2013 Mr Rigby \u2019 s brief accounts of the quarry , its design , and purpose , seemingly being just about as far back as could be gone to in terms of surviving written records .\nBut not quite .\nPublished in the St Helen \u2019 s Newspaper & Advertiser in September 1933 , was a piece entitled \u2018 Lost in Crank Caverns \u2013 Two Hours in the \u201c Underworld \u201d \u2019 .\nThis was , in fact , the extra clipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrongly recorded as dating from 1938 .\nThis article , and the expedition it chronicled , therefore predated the other by five years , and seems to have served as its blueprint to some extent .\nTwo unnamed reporters from the Advertiser embarked on a journey , not into Crank Caverns themselves , but some adjacent ( and adjoining ) passages as part of a \u2018 Behind the Scenes \u2019 series of reports .\nThe men crawled along a stone passage filled with enough earth that they were forced to \u201c emulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis passage sloped down , and eventually led to a drop of about 6 feet ( 1.8 m ) .\nThis description of the entrance and the drop off seeming very similar , if not identical , to the one written of half a decade later .\nHere the men were able to rest on some boulders and thought to have a smoke , only to discover that they had lost their cigarettes en route .\nThe candle was lit and placed as a beacon on one of the boulders , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they went , the men continued on into the maze of tunnels .\nThe men climbed these steps and found another passage \u201c reduced once again to its original rabbit hole dimensions \u201d .\nOnward they crawled , for over half an hour until , at last , they came to a dead end .\nPhysically unable to turn back , the men dug with their bare hands .\nThey made some slow progress , and then the earthen floor gave way beneath them .\nThe steps which they had climbed had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the network above the place where they had entered .\nChoosing a path from several now available to them , the men were delighted to discover their lost cigarettes , signalling that they were on the right track .\nThe piece \u2019 s conclusion gives a fascinating summary of the local lore which had led to the exploration : Before I came into possession of the archive articles quoted above , I had already read several short first-hand accounts of explorations near Crank .\nI came across these online , when doing my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and best , online write-ups I came across came from ludchurchmyblog.wordpress.com , which states : In \u2018 Crank Caverns \u2019 , posted in 2012 , the site owner wrote an account of their own visit there .\nUseful , and informative as this post was , it was the comments included below it which really drew my interest .\nSeveral of the comments stated they remembered being able to access the small , crawl-through tunnel ( \u201c the Mousie \u201d \u2013 although exactly which entrance this nickname refers to seems a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to the drop into the initial cavern when they were younger .\nPeople also stated that they knew of other entrances to the tunnel network , notably via the Stork Inn pub cellar , and St Marys Church in Billinge .\nSome of those commenting claimed to know where these entrances were , having been shown them by the landlord or priest respectively .\nIn time , others countered that they knew the landlord and/or the priest in question , and that these entrances do not exist .\nIt is noticeable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they become more and more dismissive of the idea that the tunnels have , or ever had , any real depth .\nWhat begin as pleasant , interesting , shared reminiscences , become dismissive denials within a few years .\nThe ludchurch post lead me to sthelens-connect.net where I found a thread on the caverns with a host of locals discussing them .\nOne notable post from 2004 , the year the thread was begun , contains the following : An extract from another post , this time from 2009 : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to feature in many people \u2019 s childhood memories of the caverns , mostly ( it seems ) from the 1960s and 70s , but some claimed to have visited more recently , like one 2005 poster : Several posters in the sthelens-connect.net thread promised to share maps and photographs of the lower tunnels , proving the truth of their extent beyond all doubt .\nThen nothing happened .\nTime and time again .\nPhotos and maps were not uploaded .\nPeople who agreed to meet others in person to show them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the annoyance and scorn of everyone else in the thread .\nWhat \u2019 s especially interesting about the sthelens-connect.net thread , is that it chronicles the 21st century decline of Crank Caverns .\nAlthough begun in 2004 , the latest posts date from 2021 , and the thread is 34 pages long .\nPosters comment on the fact that the caverns are being gated off , bricked up , and filled in more and more .\nIt is mentioned that people believe parts of the caverns to have been \u201c dynamited \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some say they remember seeing earth and rubbish tipped into them by council workers during the 1980s .\nDespite all of this , urban explorers and curious amateurs continued to venture into what remained of Crank Caverns , chronicling their expeditions not just in the sthelens-connect.net thread , but on forums like 28dayslater.co.uk and derelictplaces.co.uk and , of course , posting videos on YouTube .\nIn 2013 a person with the username chocolate2013 posted a pair of hand drawn maps on sthelens-connect.net .\nThe maps show maybe half a dozen chambers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show ten passages marked with highlighter which \u201c were once entrances/tunnels which lead further in but are now either fully or partly blocked \u201d .\nThen , in 2020 , in one of the last posts in the thread to date : And the reply comes : \u201c Brexit and Coronavirus.\n\u201d Published online in 2007 under the heading \u2018 Merseyside \u2019 s Underground Mysteries \u2019 is a tale of Crank Caverns penned by one Mr Thomas Slemen ( copyright Tom Slemen 2001 , according to the disclaimer in its footer ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ who vanished into the caverns whilst exploring .\nNo date of this occurrence is given .\nAccording to Slemen , only one child survived and , upon their return , told a tale of \u201c small old men with beards who killed his three friends and chased him \u201d .\nDuring his escape , the child is said to stumbled over human bones , which we may assume are to be taken as evidence of cannibalism ( if the small , bearded men are supposed to be human ) .\nBecause of previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s testimony was apparently enough for \u201c two heavily armed soldiers \u201d to enter the caverns in search of the evil little old men .\nInside , the soldiers are said to have found a heap of human bones and \u201c the ruins of an ancient church of some unknown denomination .\nThe interior of the church was lit by three large candles and grotesque gargoyles formed part of an altar \u201d .\nThe soldiers are said to have reported a feeling of being watched , and to have heard voices \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The grisly denouement reads as follows : Tom Slemen is the author of the Haunted Liverpool series of books \u2013 currently numbering thirty four volumes , but probably thirty five or six by the time this piece is published .\nHailing from Liverpool as I do , I have come across Mr Slemen \u2019 s writings many times before .\nNotably , I found his work particularly difficult to contend with when I was writing my own book 800 Years of Haunted Liverpool , published by History Press ( UK ) , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of books , in 2008 .\nI say difficult to contend with because , to be frank , Slemen \u2019 s works represent an absolute nightmare for anyone wishing to research Liverpool lore in any meaningful way .\nHis stories typically contain no sources or references , an emphasis on drama over detail , and are basically Campfire Tales whose origin is more often than not impossible to trace .\nThere is northing at all wrong with a good Ghost Story or Weird Tale , but having to wade through a mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fact , to get to real historical data is less than ideal .\nSlemen \u2019 s tales also quickly seep into local lore and Urban Legend .\nSo much so that , if you find yourself in the position of trying to get some anecdotal folklore out of a group of Scousers ( or , indeed Merseysiders ) , nine times out of ten you will end up having something from one Tom Slemen \u2019 s many , many books recounted to you instead .\nA clear example of this comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of William McKenzie \u2019 s tomb .\nInterred in 1851 , McKenzie \u2019 s grave in the churchyard at Rodney Street , Liverpool , is marked with an impressive fifteen foot ( 4.57 m ) pyramid shaped tombstone .\nSlemen wrote a story many years ago about how MacKenzie was entombed upright within the pyramid , having sold his soul to the devil .\nThe small print of this contract apparently reading that the Fiend could only collect once William was beneath the ground .\nThis now often repeated story has very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite the fact that a plaque on the monument states clearly that it was erected in 1868 , seventeen years after McKenzie was interred in an entirely conventional manner .\nSlemen \u2019 s story of the human-flesh eating gnomes of Crank Caverns has likewise passed into local lore .\nThe tale is referenced and recounted many times in articles , posts , and threads relating to the caverns online , but can not be traced back any further than the 2001 copyrighted tale .\nThe mention of soldiers , rather than police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest , however .\nAccording to a Crank Caverns page on Facebook : More information comes from The History of Billinge ( Billinge Historical Society , 2002 ) : So , although no date is given of when the killer-gnome hunt supposedly took place , we can assume that it was somewhere in the early 1940s .\nNevertheless , absolutely no record of any such occurrence exists in St Helens Library \u2019 s archive .\nInto the Well 21st century red herrings aside then , we return to the folklore written of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1930s , we can assume that when the reporter wrote of \u201c Sinn Feigners \u201d he was referring to Irish Nationalists but also , almost certainly , specifically of Catholic Irish Nationalists .\nLiverpool , Merseyside , and the surrounding areas saw an influx of Irish immigrants during the mid 1800s during the Great Famine ; a crisis caused ostensibly by potato blight , but escalated to a catastrophe by the British government \u2019 s deliberately callous policies and actions .\nIn Liverpool especially , but also the surrounding areas , communities became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass migration .\nTo quote from P. Ingram \u2019 s Sectarianism in the North West of England ( 1987 ) : I have not been able to find any historic record of the Billinge haystack burning , of those responsible for the alleged crime , or their fate .\nThe well which they were supposedly cast into , however , is a feature of the local lore of the caverns .\nAn \u201c artisanal well \u201d near Crank Caverns , is mentioned in the 2012 ludchurch blog posting , and in several of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some have suggested that this may have been a shaft ( the \u201c old shaft that was at the bottom of the woods \u201d now filled in with shredded black plastic ? )\nwhich led down into the chamber described in the 1938 report as \u201c the bed of a subterranean stream \u201d .\nWhen completely flooded , it is possible that water from this chamber may have been forced upward through the shaft and out of a well-head , thus fitting the definition of an \u201c artisanal well \u201d .\nIt seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might once have been reached via one of the passages marked as being \u201c now either fully or partly blocked \u201d on the 2013 hand-drawn map .\nCould this chamber , when only partially flooded , have also been the Underground Lake \u2013 or Blue Lagoon \u2013 which so many local explorers share childhood reminiscences of ?\nIt seems possible , though not easily provable in any conclusive way .\nThe Subterranean Church , complete with altar , seems real enough ; apparently having been visited by the 1933 expedition .\nA chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been natural , or at least pre-existing , but later enlarged and broken into by the miners .\nThe \u201c altar \u201d , it has been suggested , may have been deliberately constructed by miners as a resting place , rather than an actual place of worship .\nEqually though , it is perhaps worth noting that miners have long been known to create shrines and even chapels within their places of work .\nAn extant 2nd century CE shrine to Minerva \u2013 Goddess of war , knowledge , and craftsmanship \u2013 stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Handbridge , Chester , some 30 miles ( 48 km ) south east of Crank .\nTalk of the caverns being used for Catholic Mass during the Reformation , and of the \u201c Sinn Feigners \u201d cast into them , brings us back to the tunnels said to lead to them .\nMore crucially , it brings us to where those tunnels are supposed to originate .\nThe History of Billinge ( Billinge Historical Society , 2002 ) , gives us the following information on The Stork Inn \u2019 s history : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true or not ) of the stories about tunnels \u2013 now bricked up \u2013 beneath the pub .\nSt Mary \u2019 s in Billinge is a Roman Catholic Church , established in 1828 .\nLocal lore states that tunnels can be accessed from the church , and via a crypt in its cemetery , which wind their way to Crank Caverns .\nEven more conspicuous though , are tunnels rumoured to connect to the caverns from Birchley Hall , Billinge .\nBirchley Hall is a Grade II listed Elizabethan house built circa 1594 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the county of Lancashire , which was a stronghold for Roman Catholics during their persecution at the hands of Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I. Catholics , especially priests , were driven underground , and Catholic literature was vigorously suppressed .\nClandestine printing presses were set up at Birchley Hall during the early 1600s , and Catholic literature was printed there for secret distribution .\nFrom the Wikipedia entry for Birchley Hall : Many historic houses in England , Wales , and Ireland which were under Catholic ownership during the Reformation have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes .\nThese were hidden spaces , often with very cunningly concealed entrances and exits , in which priests ( or known active Catholics ) could be concealed should the Queen \u2019 s men come calling .\nHere are the origins of the secret rooms hidden behind bookcases , and the eyes peeping through those of a portrait , in all good Scooby Doo mysteries .\nFittingly , more often than not , the rooms from which these hidden spaces are accessed are said to be haunted .\nThis , I have long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with explaining away strange noises heard , or apparent disappearances witnessed , by untrusted visitors , rather than actual supernatural occurrences .\nThough no tunnel connecting Birchley Hall to Crank Caverns has been proved to exist , still the local folklore maintains it as a fact , as well known as the Underground Lake and the Subterranean Church .\nAnd so , I believe , we might begin to draw some conclusions about the roots of the \u201c unchristian worship \u201d supposedly practised in the caverns .\nIt seems possible that what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Catholic persecution which took place in the area during the 1600s .\nThe increasing sectarianism of the mid 1800s may have caused these old stories to resurface , and to evolve into new tales .\nSt Marys was , after all , only a few decades old at the time of the surge of Irish Catholic immigrants into England \u2019 s North West .\nThe record of \u201c Sinn Feigners \u201d supposedly thrown down a well shows us that the area around Crank was not immune to the sectarianism of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic fact that there were hidden places and tunnels in the region were people once conducted secret rituals , unsanctioned by the Protestant Church .\nEveryone had also heard the stories of there being a Subterranean Church , hidden somewhere in those ancient , mysterious abandoned mines .\nWeren \u2019 t there even bricked up tunnels in that old pub cellar , supposed to date back centuries ?\nThe dots were all there , just waiting to be joined .\nIt is now April 2022 , and Crank Caverns are no longer open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can walk in the surrounding woods , and you can visit the graffiti covered , litter strewn entrances .\nYou can even , if you are so inclined , scramble your way through the Gated Mousie ( if you \u2019 re lucky enough to find it without a padlock ) and explore a handful of a dead-ended , mined chambers .\nThough this is by no means advised .\nEven so , the more ancient network of tunnels said to stretch on for miles are now wholly inaccessible .\nAlready , it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never really existed .\nAs we have seen from the evidence presented above , Crank Caverns had already passed into local legend by the 1930s .\nTheir having been used by the military to store ammunition during the 1940s may well provide the reason some of the tunnels having been blocked ( or \u2018 dynamited \u201d ) after that date .\nPerhaps it was as simply a means of ensuring that the ammunition stored there remained dry , even if some of the adjacent chambers flooded .\nPost 1970s , the local landowners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it upon themselves to fill-in or block off as much of the network as possible .\nIn all probability , this has simply been done to stop amateur explorers ( and especially children ) getting lost , trapped , or injured therein .\nTales of flesh-hungry cave dwellers , of ghosts , and black magic rituals , may also have served as a means of keeping people out of the old mines for a time .\nHowever , in the 21st century , with Urban Explorers and Ghost Hunters keen to find new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ podcast from , old-fashioned deterrents as \u201c beware the haunted mines \u201d are no longer effective .\nInstead , they draw ever more interest and attention .\nIn that sense , it is not difficult to sympathise with the 2020 sthelens-connect.net poster who wrote \u201c Don \u2019 t blame the guy getting it filled in .\nToo many idiots these days spoiling everything \u201d .\nWhile Crank Caverns may be nothing more than a series of dead ends today , it is worth recalling the words of old Mr Rigby , as recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 , a poster on the sthelens-connect.net thread wrote : The truth is this : the earth beneath our modern 21st century crust of concrete and tarmac is riddled with caverns , tunnels , and passages .\nTheir ground-level entrances blocked for decades , centuries , and longer , if they ever even existed .\nThe origins and uses ( intended or adopted , human or otherwise ) of these light-less spaces below now long-forgotten , or else never known .\nWho can say what once dwelled down there and perhaps , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does .\nAll of which puts me in mind of a favourite passage of mine from Bram Stoker \u2019 s 1911 novel The Lair of the White Worm :", "author": "John Reppion", "url":

even ran clandestine missions for the CIA during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America is a fictionalized story of that era ) .\nBy the 1980s Lear established himself in Nevada ( where he remained until his death ) and it was then when he became very interested in the UFO phenomenon ; particularly , in the stories that began to proliferate among American researchers after the story of the ( alleged ) crash of a flying saucer in Roswell , New Mexico has resurfaced from public opinion thanks to the work of Stan Friedman , Bill Moore and other investigators .\nIt was then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered its most paranoid phase , because unlike their predecessors from the 1950s and 60s who also kept insisting the US government knew a whole lot more about UFOs than they publicly admitted through their PR campaign with the Air Force \u2019 s Blue Book project , UFOlogists in the 80 \u2019 s were now not only convinced the government kept whole squadrons of crashed saucers and their pickled occupants hidden away in heavily secured military bases like Area 51 \u2013whose existence was still officially denied despite the fact the Air Force was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it safe from curious eyes\u2013 and under the control of a secret cabal known as \u2018 Majestic 12 \u2019 , but that the government was also aware of the harrowing experiences narrated by \u2018 abductees \u2019 who claimed to be submitted to painful medical and gynecological procedures at the hands of emotionless beings with cold , black eyes ; and that either they were powerless to stop the aliens from kidnapping innocent civilians from their very homes \u2013hence the reason for the coverup and official denial\u2013 or , even worse , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a dark pact that not only threatened the freedoms of American citizens , but the entire fate of mankind itself .\nIt was into all this menagerie of disinformation that Lear dove in , and merrily helped to crank the lever of the rumor mill through \u2018 data dumps \u2019 uploaded into the nascent world wide web via bulletin board systems ( BBS ) and Usenet groups , in which he poured in his theories of how every unsubstantiated story he came across fit together into the \u2018 big picture \u2019 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So even if you are relatively new in your interest in UFOs and have never even heard of the name \u2018 John Lear \u2019 , his impact is still indelible in the field to this day through the permanence of mythologies involving underground alien bases , nefarious genetic experimentation on abductees to create human-alien hybrids , and even the enduring public fascination with John Lazar and his claims of reverse-engineering programs of extraterrestrial technology \u2013the fact that Lazar was open about his friendship with Lear when he was interviewed for a position inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his would-be employers seemed to have already know ) not only not hindered his candidacy , but it seems to have been one of the reasons why he got the job in the first place .\nWas someone counting on Lear to \u2018 spill the beans \u2019 as he was fond to do ?\nLast year our good friend and collaborator Adam Gorightly published the book Saucers , Spooks & Kooks though Daily Grail Press , which delved deep into this wacky era of UFO history .\nSo as a special treat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small excerpt from the book which might help you get a sense of just how influential John Lear was in the shaping of modern UFO narratives \u2013for better or for worse .\nGrailers are welcomed to check out the many recordings of radio appearances Lear made over the years in shows like Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell or Dark Matters Radio with Don Ecker \u2013although listeners are advised to take EVERYTHING coming from his mouth with a huge bucket of salt .\nI would also strongly encourage you to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulyas \u2019 s The Saucer Life in which John Lear \u2019 s involvement with the OH-KRILL papers and his relationship with Bill Cooper are discussed .\nGodspeed and farewell to you , o Baron Munchausen of Saucerdom .\nYou weaved webs of lies and fantasy so sticky you ended up trapped by them yourself , but without you UFOlogy loses much of its chutzpah .\nMay you manage to evade the soul-catching machines on the Moon .\nAlthough Paul Bennewitz lit the initial Dulce Base fuse , it took the better part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viral when John Lear burst on to the scene with his hair on fire .\nLear\u2014who seemingly added some measure of credibility as a Dulce Base promoter\u2014 was an airline captain and former CIA contract pilot , as well as the son of William Lear , inventor of not only the Learjet , but also the eight-track tape player .\nOn the June 11 , 1994 edition of Don Ecker \u2019 s UFOs Tonight radio program , Bill Moore stated that the bulk of John Lear \u2019 s Dulce Base information came courtesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Greys \u201d that first appeared in Bennewitz \u2019 s \u201c Project Beta \u201d report , describing the aliens who had entered into a secret treaty with the U.S. government .\nAccording to Moore : In early November 1987 , a mini-conference , comprised entirely of UFO researchers , was organized by Tom Adams and held in Crestone , Colorado .\nAmong those attending were John Lear , Linda Howe , Christian Lambright , David Perkins , Gary Massey , Lockheed engineer John Andrews , and Jim Speiser , founder of the ParaNet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was at this Crestone \u201c meeting of the minds \u201d \u2014according to Bill Moore\u2014that the Dulce Base story was fleshed-out using Paul Bennewitz as the primary source of information , or at least that was the scenario that Moore laid out in his interview with Don Ecker .\nWhat Moore was most likely referring to as the \u201c Dulce Base story \u201d later evolved into \u201c The UFO Cover-Up \u201d , a controversial seven-page document that Lear posted to ParaNet in December 1987 .\nDuring the Crestone conference , Lear suggested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up with a joint statement addressing the current state of ufology .\nInitially everyone was receptive to this idea , and on the second day they gathered in a meeting room to come to a consensus as to what this group statement would say .\nAs the discussion progressed , everyone seemed in agreement that some form of unidentified aerial phenomenon was involved with the cattle mutilations , but John Lear wanted to take it several steps further and definitively declare that Earth was under attack from an alien race .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about where Lear wanted to take our statement , but I was trying to be polite , and I said , \u2018 I can \u2019 t quite get behind that one , John .\nI \u2019 m not signing my name to that.\n\u2019 And from there this whole idea of putting out a statement quickly fell apart .\nLear got miffed ; he thought he could come away from our conference with this Crestone Manifesto , and it didn \u2019 t happen\u2014so he was kind of pouty the rest of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening he and Linda Howe suddenly decided to take off and go on a road trip together , leaving the conference early .\nAnd I said to her : \u2018 What ?\nYou can \u2019 t leave now , we still have another day.\n\u2019 And she said , \u2018 Well , we have to go right away to Roswell to see Clifford Stone .\nIt \u2019 s very important .\nHe has some information for us.\n\u2019 And that really seemed out of character for Linda , and raised a few eyebrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nShe \u2019 d stay to the bitter end if there was some sort of gathering happening .\nAnd we thought it must be really damned important whatever Clifford Stone had to tell her .\nOn their way to Roswell , Lear and Howe had a stop-over in Albuquerque where they \u201c had dinner with Col. ( Ernie ) Edwards who kept track of Dr. Paul Bennewitz for the Air Force and met with Condor ( Robert Collins ) \u2026who showed us some transcripts regarding EBE3 , one of the living aliens sequestered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the messages said , \u2018 EBE3 wants to see the ocean .\nWe had better comply or he \u2019 ll disappear again.\n\u2019 \u201d Howe and Lear \u2019 s next stop was Roswell where they met up with another spooky ex-military type , the aforementioned Sgt .\nClifford Stone , who claimed that as a child growing up in Southern Ohio he had encountered extraterrestrials , and that these encounters had come to the attention of the U.S. government , who monitored Stone throughout his youth and into adulthood .\nDuring the Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in short order ( or so Stone claimed ) he was whisked away to a top secret movie-screening room at Fort Belvoir and shown a film of a UFO retrieval , then afterwards placed on a special military team assigned to crash-retrievals , during the course of which Stone identified no less than fifty-seven different alien races .\nIn the summer of 1986 , Stone had been in correspondence with Paul Bennewitz , receiving what could best be described as two rather lengthy and rambling letters in which Bennewitz went into exhaustive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dulce , perhaps comparing notes about the different aliens that Stone himself had allegedly encountered during his crash-retrieval assignments .\nIt was Stone \u2019 s involvement with Bennewitz that appears to have been at least one of the factors that motivated Howe and Lear to skip out early from Crestone to rendezvous in Roswell with Stone .\nAll of these peculiar peregrinations seemed have the singular focus in mind of finding out more of what Bennewitz knew about the ETs and the alleged Dulce underground base .\nNot long after his road trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet with Bennewitz .\nAccording to Christian Lambright : Following his interactions with Lear , Bennewitz changed his phone number and withdrew from the front lines of ufology .\nLambright suspects that the cause behind Bennewitz \u2019 s self-imposed ufological exile had something to do with his meeting with Lear , not to mention that by this time Bennewitz was teetering on the edge of a psychological meltdown .", "author": "red pill junkie", "url": "https://www.dailygrail.com/2022/04/liars-leeriness-controversial-ufo-figure-john-lear-dies-included-excerpt-of-saucers-spooks-kooks-by-gorightly/", "published": "Tue, 19 Apr 2022 20:07:38 +0000", "published_utc": 1650413258, "collection_utc": 1650406797}, {"id": "dailygrail--2022-04-19--News Briefs 19-04-2022", "date": "2022-04-19", "source": "dailygrail", "title": "News Briefs 19-04-2022", "content": "\u2022 Also : Sandy Hook families may not buy Infowars \u2019 sudden bankruptcy filing .\n\u2022 Russian warship sunken in @ @ @ @ @ carrying a piece of the \u2018 true cross \u2019 \u2013 a treasured Christian relic \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2022 SETI astronomers just simulated what an alien message might look like .\n\u2022 @ @ @ @ @ on Earth began much earlier than we thought .\n\u2022 Why does evolution keep turning @ @ @ @ @ Monkeys can sense their own heartbeats , an ability tied to mental health , consciousness @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 Time might not exist , according to physicists and philosophers \u2013 but that \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ the Day :", "author": "Greg", "url": "https://www.dailygrail.com/2022/04/news-briefs-19-04-2022/", "published": "Tue, 19 Apr 2022 12:49:22 +0000", "published_utc": 1650386962, "collection_utc": 1650406798}, {"id": "dailygrail--2022-04-20--News Briefs 20-04-2022", "date": "2022-04-20", "source": "dailygrail", "title": "News Briefs 20-04-2022", "content": "\u2022 Another species of hominin may still be alive .\n\u2022 Scientists think they \u2019 ve uncovered the mystery of the Easter Island statues .\n\u2022 $ 1 million Shroud of Turin challenge issued : \u2018 If the Turin Shroud is a forgery , show how it was done \u201d .\n\u2022 The harrowing of hell : Did Jesus have a near-death experience ?\n\u2022 Psych out : When a shadowy estate in Maine became the world epicenter of psychics and psychedelics .\n\u2022 A copy of the semi-mythical original VARO edition of M.

Furth , Chief , Office of Naval Research , Washington , 25 , D.C. \u201d and which had the words \u201c HAPPY EASTER \u201d scrawled upon it .\nBut first a slight digression is necessary , for those not familiar with the background to the mystery .\nHoping to capitalize on the growing interest of flying saucers , in 1955 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UFO \u2013 a controversial book whose author , Morris Ketchum Jessup , had been an instructor of astronomy and mathematics at the University of Michigan and at Drake University , and who possibly completed his doctorate degree in astrophysics .\nBesides these credentials , Jessup was also an amateur archaeologist who went on expeditions to the dense jungles of Central America and participated in studies of the ancient ruins discovered there .\nWith ( or despite ) this scientific background , Jessup \u2019 s book explored many things for which science offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier times were attributed to supernatural agencies .\nAs such , his pioneering work is a catalogue of all kinds of extraordinary occurrences ( more commonly referred to today as Fortean phenomena ) : meteorological oddities , itemized falls of organic matter from the skies , mysterious marks and imprints left on the ground , instances of disappearing people , ships and planes , anachronistic ( out-of-place ) objects , and other evidence of a technologically advanced \u2018 mother culture \u2019 in pre-historic antiquity .\nIn short , he was an early proponent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronauts \u2019 .\nJessup linked the building of the \u2018 improbable \u2019 ancient monuments with superior neighbors who visited the Earth millennia ago .\nAncient visitors , he theorized , who possessed a mastery of the universal gravitational field .\nThe controlling of gravitational field reactance , he further speculated , was the means of propulsion in modern-day sightings of UFOs .\nIn both his book and on the lecture circuit Jessup insisted that \u2013 when it came to future space travel \u2013 modern rocketry was a complete waste of time and money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exotic methods of propulsion should be explored .\nIn particular , he called for extensive research into Einstein \u2019 s Unified Field Theory , convinced that applications of this knowledge ( levitation , etc . )\nhad been employed by those meddling with terrestrial affairs as far back as antediluvian times .\nAccording to some researchers , it was this appeal to the government to investigate UFT technologies that so disturbed the anonymous sender of the manila envelope to the ONR , shortly after a cheaper paperback of The Case for the UFO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much as a letter of explanation , the parcel that arrived at the Office of Naval Research contained only a battered copy of Jessup \u2019 s book , marked throughout with hand-written annotations and frequent underscoring in three distinctive colors of ink \u2013 blue , blue-violet and blue-green .\nThis \u2013 and a perceived difference in handwriting styles \u2013 led certain higher-ups at the ONR to conclude that the book had been passed back and forth between three individuals whom they referred to as \u2018 Mr .\nA \u2019 , \u2018 Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 , each of which had added their own comments to Jessup \u2019 s text .\nAlthough it is not known what Admiral Furth thought of his gift ( other than the obvious fact that he didn \u2019 t toss it into the nearest wastebasket ) , at some point a Captain Sidney Sherby ( who obtained the book from a Major Ritter ) , and Commander George W. Hoover ( Special Projects Officer , ONR ) \u201c indicated direct interest in some of the material therein.\n\u201d This might have been because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondents seemingly contained intimate insider knowledge of the UFO phenomenon , and at the time , both officers were interested in anti-gravity research .\nWhatever the reason , so intrigued were they by the utter strangeness of the notations , they eventually contacted Jessup , inviting him to visit the ONR in Washington D.C. in order to discuss these puzzling comments .\nAccording to some accounts , as Jessup studied the contents he was bewildered by the alien tone of the annotated voices .\nThe seeming familiarity the persons had with esoteric technologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people had the answers to all the questions posed in his book .\nThey knew things that NO one should know .\nBut the events described were simply too fantastic to believe .\nWas it a hoax to discredit the emerging field of ufology ?\nMystified at first , as he continued to read , he became increasingly alarmed .\nWhy all the fuss ?\nWhy on earth would the Navy be so interested in unsolicited material that was obviously the product of a deranged mind ?\nFlipping through the pages , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least one piece of the mystery , this being the identity of one of those who did the annotating .\nYes , he was sure of it .\nThe idiosyncratic phraseology , repeated misspellings , careless punctuation , and unnecessary capitalization all matched perfectly with the language and peculiar grammatical style of a series of perplexing letters that , a year previous , had arrived in his own mailbox .\nNot Seeing is Believing Not long after the publication of his book , Jessup had received correspondence from a person who identified himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were filled with cryptic references to a secret naval experiment in 1943 that rendered a ship and its crew completely invisible while at sea .\nFrom a nearby merchant vessel , the letter writer claimed to have witnessed first-hand the vanishing battleship , along with the horrific effects the intensified electromagnetic fields had on its unsuspecting crewmembers .\nAlthough Jessup eventually dismissed the man as a harmless crank , here on page 8 of the marked-up copy of his book was the following comment by the one previously labeled as \u2018 Mr .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ been scratching his head when he left the Office of Naval Research on that day , but at the officers \u2019 request , he produced the letters that he had received from the enigmatic Allende .\nWhether or not the ONR was looking for an intelligence leak , or some type of a cipher in the lengthy annotations that could be used to pass sensitive information under the wire , remains unclear .\nBut if they were looking for more oblique references to experiments conducted by the Navy involving Einsteinian physics , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the delusional ramblings in the annotated book , the Allende letters contained mind-boggling descriptions of Navy tests with sophisticated electromagnetic camouflage , along with the nightmarish results of unified field theory technologies on the human guinea pigs that participated in the experiment .\nThose who went \u201c stark raving , gibbering , running mad \u201d after being \u201c caught in the flow \u201d or \u201c stuck in the green.\n\u201d For as the letter explicitly warned ( with some alterations to the nonstandard grammar ) : \u201c The experiment was a complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d But if the tale of a Navy destroyer enshrouded in a shimmering greenish mist prior to gradually vanishing from the perception of human observers was a hard cookie to swallow ( replete with hysterical sailors \u201c going blank \u201d , \u201c freezing \u201d , \u201c burning \u201d , and \u201c getting stuck \u201d , or even more terrifyingly , their bodies becoming fused to metal bulkheads ) , another claim by Allende must have seemed utterly preposterous .\nAccording to him , the same hyper-fields were also responsible for the accidental , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perplexity of the Navy \u201d ) of the USS Eldridge ( the alleged ship in question ) from its berth in Philadelphia to Norfolk , Virginia , where it suddenly appeared before disappearing again \u2013 only to reappear at eyeblink speed back at the Philadelphia shipyard .\nHowever , to \u2018 prove \u2019 this freakish event really occurred , he offered some vague references to tiny articles printed in ( unnamed ) regional newspapers around the time , which mentioned seamen disappearing before the disbelieving eyes of waitresses in a beer joint near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic claims made by Allende sparked enough interest that the ONR \u2013 or at least a couple of its officers \u2013 took the marked-up paperback to the Varo Corporation in Garland , Texas , a high-tech firm engaged in aerospace research contracts for the military , and had them clandestinely reproduce a small number of copies .\nThe laborious task of re-typing the entire book along with all the copious notes , interjections , underlining , etc .\n( using mimeograph stencils so that they appeared separately in red ink ) , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as appendices , was said to have been given to a Miss Michael ( ? )\nAnn Dunn , the personal secretary to the president of the company .\nPerhaps not surprisingly , leading researchers of the Jessup-Allende case afterwards found no record of Miss Dunn having ever been employed there .\nEven so , around 25 copies were produced ( some say 127 ) , spiral bound between pale-blue cardstock covers , which were to be circulated among certain military personnel .\nAccording to the unsigned introduction to the Varo edition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration of further pursuit of this unconventional material.\n\u201d The anonymous author ( s ? )\nof the introduction also states that no attempt was made using ultraviolet light or other known methods to read material that was deleted ( i.e .\nmarked-out ) , and that , although the discussions and underscoring of \u2018 Mr .\nA \u2019 , \u2018 Mr .\nB \u2019 , and \u2018 Jemi \u2019 might seem to be in the form of a code , a superficial examination had thus far not revealed any .\nAnd so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dark rumors circulating in the UFO community abou a certain document in the possession of top military brass , through which \u2013 if a copy were to surface \u2013 the truth about UFOs would finally be known .\nAs microfilm and other facsimile copies of the Varo Edition eventually \u2018 found \u2019 their way into the hands of a few persistent civilian UFO researchers , it \u2019 s not hard to understand why they considered it to be \u201c the fantastic key to the flying saucer mystery.\n\u201d The odd , scientific-sounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the document represented a leak from shadowy government insiders , while the bizarre phraseology and slip-slop grammar , not to mention the arrogant mockery or cold indifference to humankind , convinced others that the marginalia were the conversations of alien beings themselves .\nIn that the annotators at times referred to themselves as gypsies \u2013 \u201c and we are a discredited people , ages ago\u2026 yet , man wonders where \u2018 we \u2019 came from \u201d \u2013 it was even supposed that these mysterious wanderers might be related to underground survivors of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranded \u2019 on earth due to some cataclysmic event .\nAfter surreptitiously interacting with our species , they were now telepathically illuminating Dr. Jessup , convincing his scientifically trained mind of their unknown existence .\nFloating derelict worlds , navigable space contrivances , vaulted undersea metropolises , time freezes , abductions , showers of decayed ground-up organic matter from the inhabitants of celestial hydroponic-tanks \u2013 all of the suppositions in his book were real .\nThat the government was interested in these things was tantamount to proof .\nAnd if handled properly \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navy had stumbled upon during the Philadelphia Experiment \u2013 controlled transport of manned spaceships , at irrelevant speeds to any desired point the instant it is desired , was possible .\nNot long after mimeographed copies began making the rounds outside of military channels , darker aspects of possessing \u201c the fantastic key \u201d were reported , and were soon embroidered into the legend .\nAs researchers pondered such things as tremendously compacted tough plastics and metal lamination , measure-markers , sheets of diamond , burning coats , magnetic nets , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mowing the lawn , incidents of \u2018 bad luck \u2019 plagued their efforts .\nThose who acquired a copy of the Varo reprint were kept under constant surveillance .\nBorrowed copies disappeared in the mail .\nHomes ( where the book was ) were destroyed by fire .\nWorse still , there were fatal heart attacks and premature deaths among prominent ufologists .\nSurprisingly , no one seemed to notice the similarities between the scribbled remarks interspersed with the text by the three annotators , and those sinister UFO silencers known as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarthy-complexioned and speaking in a stilted , robotic manner , an analogue with the MIB might explain the idiosyncrasies of the annotators , as well as the awkward composition of their scrawls .\nEven the clich\u00e9s and colloquialisms associated with the MIB phenomena are to be found in the conversations between these brothers \u201c of a different blood \u201d \u2013 those who speak the black tongue of their fellow gypsies .\nAnd like copies of the Varo edition , on numerous occasions the MIB , too , were said to appear and disappear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiencing a strange chain of events that he believed were connected to his involvement with the Allende letters , Jessup \u2013 who at first was baffled by the comments , and then skeptical \u2013 now began to think that they might be worthy of further investigation .\nIn fact , those around him thought that he had become obsessed with the matter , as he devoted considerable time to re-annotating one of the Varo copies that was given to him by the ONR for his cooperation in its printing .\nAs he grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his good friend , the well-respected naturalist and UFO researcher Ivan T. Sanderson , for safe-keeping in the event that something \u201c unpleasant \u201d were to happen to him .\nWas he being overly dramatic , those close to him wondered ?\nSix months later they would get their answer .\nMost published accounts of the Allende Letters and the Varo Edition begin with the discovery of the dead body of Morris Ketchum Jessup , slumped over the wheel of his white Chevy station wagon as a sunset flared through the coconut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Florida on April 20 , 1959 .\nThe medical examiners would call his death a suicide from acute carbon monoxide poisoning .\nA hose protruding from the rag-sealed rear window was attached to the exhaust pipe .\nDue to the mysterious circumstances that surrounded his death \u2013 such as no autopsy having been performed ( his body was donated to medical research ) \u2013 there were allegations of foul play .\nWhat new information had he dredged up that someone wanted suppressed ?\nBut in the midst of a great deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his death , there came the news of suicide notes that had been received by various associates of his .\nEvidently Jessup had carried out his own death , with the intent of communicating certain findings from beyond the grave during a pre-arranged s\u00e9ance on Long John Nebel \u2019 s popular all night radio show .\nMany were stunned by this new turn of events .\nWhat had caused him to go off the deep end ?\nIf the man who had frightened formal science had taken his own life , was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it artificially induced by some flashy comic book technology in a Manchurian Candidate-type scenario , with the suicide notes being part of the cover-up of murder by government agents ?\nMight his bizarre behavior \u2013 the \u201c endless stream of coincidences \u201d and \u201c unreality \u201d that he claimed to experience \u2013 be symptoms of a mind-control process ?\nBut another question was worth asking : was Allende \u2019 s bunkum \u2013 whether a deliberate hoax or the delusions of a mental patient \u2013 directly responsible for the death of a devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1960s , books like Gray Barker \u2019 s The Strange Case of Dr. M.K .\nJessup , Invisible Horizons by Vincent Gaddis , Uninvited Visitors by Ivan T. Sanderson , and Allende Letters : New UFO Breakthrough by Brad Steiger and Joan Whritenour further fueled the persistent rumors that Jessup had been silenced by an alphabet-soup government agency , due to his involvement in the ONR/Varo incident .\nHowever , perhaps owing to the moderate success of these and other publications featuring the mystery ( along with the buzz the story created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a balding , near penniless drifter marched into the headquarters of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization ( APRO ) in Tucson , Arizona and introduced himself as Carl Meredith Allen , A.K.A .\nCarlos Miguel Allende .\nNot happy about others cashing in on his story , he admitted to fabricating the entire thing .\nHe had done so , he claimed , because he was at the time frightened by Jessup \u2019 s book and his public urging for further UFT research , which he felt was dangerous .\nHe then produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had underlined in brown ink certain of his earlier annotations , calling them \u201c the crazyest [ sic ] pack of lies I ever wrote.\n\u201d Well , not everything was false , he told them .\nThe instantaneous teleportation of the ship really occurred , and could be verified by other witnesses if they could be found .\nAnd then there were those old newspaper articles that mentioned a sailor doing a literal disappearing act during a tavern brawl .\nMuch like the ship in question ( although presumably without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would reappear later to recant his \u2018 confession \u2019 in its entirety .\nDespite Allen/Allende \u2019 s retraction , for the next decade the story that he had initiated fizzled \u2013 only to reappear in a big way with the 1979 publication of The Philadelphia Experiment : Project Invisibility , by Charles Berlitz and William Moore .\nAlthough the book was highly entertaining and well researched , critics accused the authors of plagiarizing key elements from a dramatic fictional account of the PX legend that was published a year earlier .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and embellished the tale with a fantastic conspiracy , it \u2019 s possible that some of the information they unearthed offered something of value : in particular , a clue as to the identity of a scientist who conducted a series of tests attempting to apply the UFT hypotheses for military applications .\nUnless it was just another of Moore \u2019 s canards , the scientist in question went by the alias of Dr. Franklin Reno , a pseudonym apparently created from a road sign in Venango County , Pennsylvania that offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt should be mentioned that this Dr. Reno ( or Rinehart ) was the same scientist who supposedly confided certain technical details to Allende .\nHowever , with regards to this new information about Project Rainbow ( the alleged code name for the PX ) , Bill Moore \u2019 s detractors would point out that years ago he publicly confessed to have been recruited by government spooks to knowingly pass on disinformation so as to discredit certain UFO researchers .\nThis fact alone would seem to undermine his credibility .\nAt any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he certainly has an uncanny ability to ferret out information that others aren \u2019 t able to obtain \u2013 although conveniently , perhaps , many of these breakthroughs come from anonymous sources that can \u2019 t be corroborated .\nA perfect example of this is the elusive newspaper report on the strange circumstances surrounding the tavern brawl .\nThe authors claim to have received a photocopy of a clipping that was sent anonymously , which \u2013 if authentic \u2013 would seem to verify some of Allende \u2019 s claims about \u201c daffy dames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nUnfortunately , the source didn \u2019 t include the all-important name of the regional paper .\nWhy not , one has to wonder , if they \u2019 re sending the clipping anonymously ?\nAlso , it seems a bit odd that in the undated article , the actual name of the beer-joint where the incident occurred is never mentioned by name .\nThat the authors mention the \u201c significant fact \u201d that \u201c the column width is a bit greater than was used by any of Philadelphia dailies in the 1940s \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut even if this wasn \u2019 t more \u2018 trickery \u2019 on Moore \u2019 s part to smoke out the source ( as in the case of his later MJ-12 shenanigans ) , he was negligent in not checking certain details supplied by genuine sources , as was the case with a Miami housewife named Anna Genzlinger .\nAfter mistaking carbon monoxide concentration with blood-alcohol levels in the medical examiner \u2019 s report on Jessup \u2019 s death , Mrs. Genzlinger passed this erroneous information on to Moore \u2013 who , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood contained a lethal amount of alcohol at the time of his death .\nCombined with certain medications that he was taking , this would have essentially incapacitated him , a point cited by the authors as further evidence that he may have been murdered because he knew too much about the Philadelphia Experiment , as opposed to committing suicide because of untreated chronic depression .\nIn reality , Jessup \u2019 s blood-alcohol was negative , as Mrs. Genzlinger later corrected in her own book about the astronomer \u2019 s mysterious life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jessup Dimension , the mystically-oriented Mrs. Genzlinger , when not investigating the strange occurrences and peculiar coincidences of the Jessup/Allende affair by more normal means , attempted to use her psychic abilities to obtain information from Jessup , who she believed to be in a \u201c holding pattern \u201d ever since his tragic death .\nWhile searching through a facsimile copy of the Varo Edition at the constant urging of her subconscious , she was stunned by a particular paragraph where the author asks : \u201c Could you freeze a man and instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause him to be invisible\u2026 Could you freeze the crew of a ship , and remove them from the vessel ?\n\u201d To which \u201c Mr .\nB \u201d responds in his particular delicate shade of ink : But was he only guessing ?\nOr was it , as she was beginning to believe , that Jessup knew more than he was letting on , whether through direct involvement or by accidental observation ?\nAnd if so , had the scientist been made to forget certain key memories ?\nDelving further into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( at least to her own satisfaction ) that during the relevant years of 1943-1944 Jessup had been involved in some kind of classified work for the government .\nThat this involved studying sources of crude rubber in the headwaters of the Amazon for the USDA didn \u2019 t jibe with the level of investigation that he was subjected to by the FBI for a sensitive position .\nBeing informed that microfilm records for that time frame were badly deteriorated only reinforced her suspicions that the mysterious rubber corporation was a cover for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by filing additional FOIA requests , she was told that the documents were being withheld to protect material that was exempt from disclosure .\nHowever , around this time , a promising new lead turned up .\nA close friend of Jessup \u2019 s named Dr. J. Manson Valentine stated privately that Jessup had discovered something \u201c unbelievable \u201d which , unfortunately , he couldn \u2019 t prove .\nAccording to Dr. Valentine , Jessup had also been approached by the Navy to continue working on the PX , but that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adverse effects of space-time distortion on humans .\nDespite these new revelations , the Department of the Navy continued to send form \u201c response \u201d letters to public inquiries about the so-called Philadelphia Experiment , stating that in view of present scientific knowledge they didn \u2019 t believe such things were possible except in the realm of science fiction .\nWith their Xerox machines humming , others who were skeptical of the story offered a more prosaic explanation of the invisibility cloak involved .\nOne of them , seasoned ufologist Jacques Vallee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a distorted and/or exaggerated account of an actual experiment , which used massive generators to create the powerful electromagnetic fields required for degaussing a ship ( in order to make them undetectable to the magnetically triggered proximity fuses of mines and torpedoes ) .\nAs part of his article in the Journal of Scientific Exploration ( \u201c The Anatomy of a Hoax : The Philadelphia Experiment 50 Years Later \u201d ) Vallee cited as evidence the testimony of a former sailor who said he was there when the experiment was supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshall Barnes later attacked Vallee \u2019 s journalistic integrity , claiming that the \u2018 witness \u2019 who said that nothing unusual happened with the Eldridge had made other statements that proved to be false when checked against Navy documents .\nAccording to Barnes , by allowing this disinformation ( misinformation ? )\n, Vallee , himself , was promoting research fraud .\nEvidently , the bad luck associated with the Varo Edition even applies to the most respected of researchers !\nBarnes was also one of the investigators who debunked Al Bielek \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been one of the Naval technicians who \u201c fell through time \u201d when he jumped off the Eldridge during the Philadelphia Experiment .\nHis fantastic tales of time-travel , hyperspace radiation burns , aliens and UFOs in the underground caverns of Montauk AFB were said to be sheer lunacy .\nAnd , obviously still having an axe to grind , Barnes next launched an internet campaign targeting the producers of A & E channel \u2019 s investigative television show The Unexplained , after feeling that they did a hatchet job on him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims made by professional debunkers of the PX .\nFor the program , he had also arranged a demonstration using diffraction film to create a mirage effect of optical invisibility by refracting light \u2013 suggesting that a similar effect could be achieved with intense electromagnetic fields , such as those allegedly produced during the Philadelphia Experiment .\nWith all the pranksters , proto-ostension sufferers , and CIA psyopsers we \u2019 ve encountered thus far , enter Mr./Ms .\nSmyth and the \u2018 real \u2019 story of the legendary Philadelphia Experiment .\nIn attempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of experiments that had the long-term goal of creating a new military arsenal ( of electromagnetic countermeasures including optical , magnetic and radar invisibility ) , according to Smyth , tests involving Einstein \u2019 s UFT technologies were all failures .\nDespite taking precautions , attempts to both eliminate a real ship \u2019 s magnetic image and create a ghost magnetic image of a ship where there was no ship had catastrophic results , with the crewmen involved suffering burns , toxicity and \u201c severe \u201d psychosomatic ailments .\nYet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoting the \u2018 secret \u2019 that the experiment was a success in a circular intel caper \u201c where truth was afforded real invisibility.\n\u201d In this way , \u201c while denying the validity of UFO sightings it doesn \u2019 t hurt to have a little mystique , an aura of astonishing achievement leak out \u2013 because if we \u2019 re ever really confronted by an aerial enemy , terrestrial or otherwise , we can always turn around and say that we \u2019 ve had it all along , which will keep people from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a couple of chapters of which have been posted on the Internet by \u201c Akronos Publishing \u201d ) , Smyth claims that the mysterious Dr. Reno ( or Rinehart ) was really Lou Gebhardt , one of those involved in the project , and it was he who \u2018 handled \u2019 Allen/Allende , and also ( or someone impersonating him ) , William Moore .\nInterestingly enough though , as far back as 1963 , an anonymous source calling himself \u201c Colonel B \u201d wrote to researcher Gray Barker ( see The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) claiming that the ONR was interested in Allende \u2019 s notations because he \u201c DID COME CLOSE to some of the circumstances of ACTUAL experiments.\n\u201d When I finally managed to obtain a copy of the Varo Edition \u2013 and after spending considerable time attempting to decipher the annotations and emphasized passages using the key-words \u201c HAPPY EASTER \u201d \u2013 I eventually began to appreciate it for what it most definitely is : a remarkable literary achievement .\nWith the peculiarity of his writing style , and descriptions of things almost beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s decidedly mediocre prose ( his \u2018 scientific \u2019 approach to unraveling many historical enigmas ) into a work of epic proportions .\nAnd whether or not he was a master leg-puller , had been handled as part of an intel caper , or suffered from a psychological disorder , there was certainly a touch of genius involved \u2013 in that he had convinced so many people that his scribbled ramblings were of potentially great importance .\nWith that being said , having been made aware of Einstein \u2019 s curious inactivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can \u2019 t help but wonder , \u201c What if ?\n\u201d when Allende spoke of \u201c a truth too huge , too fantastic , to not be told.\n\u201d Especially when today , concepts like anti-gravity propulsion , mercury-based plasma vortex engines , and magnetic field disruptors are used to explain the sightings of enormous , totally silent black triangular craft seen by hundreds of reliable witnesses .\nWith relation to the PX , these massive objects are often described as being able to hang motionless in the sky prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually disappear before one \u2019 s gaze .\nBut as to the underlying science of these genuine unknowns , I sometimes think about poor Miss Dunn having to laboriously retype Jessup \u2019 s entire book , along with the annotations of \u2018 Mr .\nA \u2019 , \u2018 Mr .\nB \u2019 and \u2018 Jemi \u2019 on mimeograph stencils .\nUnlike the teleportation machinery mentioned , quicker methods of producing the Varo Edition were still a thing of the far distant future .\nUpdate , 28 April 2022 : This essay was originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 .\nThe author , Blair MacKenzie Blake , has recently posted an exciting update to the story at the

platforms for well-known artists and musicians to connect with their fan base .\nAs one example , the Instagram feed of Jimmy Page \u2013 the legendary guitarist for Led Zeppelin \u2013 has shared a number of personal anecdotes and photos direct from the man himself , despite his mostly private lifestyle .\nOne such shared memory would no doubt have grabbed the attention of those interested in the occult and/or ancient Egypt : Page posted a well-known stereogram picture of a zeppelin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1931 , along with an image of himself in front of the Great Sphinx , with a tantalising caption noting that he first visited the site in 1977 , and it \u201c was the first of what was to be a succession of intense visits to the pyramids of Giza and the Sphynx.\u2063 \u201d I say \u2018 tantalising \u2019 , because as many know , Jimmy Page has long been fascinated with occultist Aleister Crowley ( see \u201c Occult Rock \u201d for more ) and his revelatory experience while honeymooning in Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kelly , where Crowley claims they both came into contact with supernatural entities \u2013 firstly Rose , who went into trance states , proclaimed prophetic messages allegedly from the Egyptian god Horus , and led Crowley to a museum to show him the Stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu ( exhibit number 666 , natch ) .\nCrowley says he was subsequently contacted by a supernatural entity named Aiwass , who dictated a text , Liber AL vel Legis ( aka The Book of the Law ) , which became the foundational document for his philosophy/religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he became interested in Crowley and the occult at a young age , reading Magick in Theory and Practice at age 11 ( or in other interviews , at age 15 ) , which sparked a lifelong fascination with the infamous British occultist .\nAs Led Zeppelin grew to be one of the biggest rock bands on the planet , Page employed his new-found wealth to snap up all manner of memorabilia and artefacts associated with Crowley , from rare publications and items of his personal wardrobe , right through to Crowley \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boleskine House .\nAt one point , Page apparently even attempted to purchase the ancient Stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu ( known in Thelema as the Stele of Revealing ) .\nAfter engaging the legendary album art design team HipGnosis ( Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey \u2018 Po \u2019 Powell ) \u2013 perhaps best known for the iconic cover art for Pink Floyd \u2019 s Dark Side of the Moon \u2013 for Led Zeppelin \u2019 s upcoming album Houses of the Holy ( 1973 ) , Page requested that \u2018 Po \u2019 try and buy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 1973 photographing the pyramids during the design phase of the Dark Side of the Moon project .\nEgypt was preparing for another Arab-Israeli war , and the museum in Cairo was deserted and surrounded by sandbags in case of an air strike .\nIts director had never heard of Led Zeppelin , but he agreed to give Po a private viewing of the stele .\n\u201c He escorted me through a series of underground catacombs , walking by torchlight for what seemed like miles , \u201d says Po , \u201c glimpsing dust-covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt was very spooky , and like something out of Raiders of the Lost Ark .\nWe finally came to a box and opened it up and inside was the Stele of Revealing .\nI got chills just looking at it.\n\u201d Po tried to bid for the artifact .\n\u201c I said , \u2018 How much do you want ?\nFive thousand dollars , ten thousand.\n\u2019 I went up to twenty-five thousand dollars , but the director insisted it wasn \u2019 t for sale.\n\u201d Eventually , he offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,000 , if Jimmy Page wrote a letter confirming he \u2019 d buy it .\n\u2026Po \u2019 s failed bid to buy the original was a rare instance of someone saying no to Led Zeppelin .\nBring It On Home : Peter Grant , Led Zeppelin and Beyond \u2013 The Story of Rock \u2019 s Greatest Manager , by Mark Blake ( 2018 ) Whether Page assented to the $ 2,000 plaster copy is unknown , though he is seen holding a facsimile of the artifact , in front of a wreathed portrait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segment of Kenneth Anger \u2019 s Lucifer Rising film ( which Page originally created the soundtrack to , before a falling out with Anger \u2013 the linked version on YouTube has placed Page \u2019 s soundtrack over the original film ) .\nThirty one years after his bid to purchase the Stele of Revealing failed , Page returned to to Cairo to view the artifact , on the 100th anniversary of Crowley \u2019 s channelling of The Book of the Law \u2013 a visit that has been noted on his Instagram account on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 ) with some accompanying images ( including a photo of the # 666 catalogue card number ) : So what would the \u201c intense \u201d experiences be that Page referred to in his post ?\nPerhaps he was simply referring to the emotional effects of visiting artifacts and locations that act as a touchstone for his Crowley obsession .\nBut he could also have been suggesting magickal , paranormal , or at least liminal experiences , as he has previously discussed the alternative states of consciousness associated with ritual magick .\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests whether he felt like the music he was creating and playing was tapping into some \u2018 other \u2019 energy , Page replied \u201c I \u2019 m reluctant to get into it because it just sounds\u2026pretentious .\nBut yeah , obviously , you can tell that from the live things .\nIt was almost a trance-state sometimes.\n\u201d ( When Giants Walked the Earth : A Biography Of Led Zeppelin , by Mick Wall ) .\nMore explicitly , in an interview with Paul Kent in 2003 , the rock guitar god said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u201c I found that [ Crowley \u2019 s ] system

"title": "In Search of Six-Fingered Men (and Women): Indicators of a lost civilization?", "content": "In our Monday news briefs we posted a link to an extraordinary story , which detailed recent discoveries at the archaeological sites of Gobekli Tepe and Karahan Tepe that suggest most of the remains of an unknown , extraordinarly ancient civilisation still lie buried beneath the soil of eastern Turkey ( as in , possibly 13,000 years ago \u2013 three times as long ago as the building of the Great Pyramid ) .\nI posted a Twitter thread pointing out some of most eye-opening parts of the article , but here I just wanted to touch on perhaps the weirdest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people today , most might think of \u2018 the six-fingered man \u2019 that Inigo Montoya is seeking revenge against in The Princess Bride ( aka Count Rugen ) .\nBut having an extra digit is a well-known and reasonably common condition , referred to as polydactyly or polydactylism , caused by genetic mutation and occuring in between 1 in 300 and 1 in 3000 births ( though it doesn \u2019 t always result in a fully formed and functional finger ) .\nBut polydactyly has been observed throughout earlier times in history \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times feared , but in both cases usually within mythical or supernatural frameworks .\nIn \u201c Six Fingers in Art and Archaeology \u201d ( available online within this PDF ) , archaeologist Richard Barnett noted that though the topic had received virtually no attention from scholars , his own research had found that polydactyly was represented in ancient art , literature and artifacts from multiple locations including Egypt , Malta , Jordan and Iran .\nThough it was \u201c most often recorded in divine or heroic representations \u201d , he noted it also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people as well , such as on sarcophagi with images of the deceased .\nThe same appears to have been true in the New World , where Native Americans tribes are thought to have revered people with extra toes or fingers .\nThe Pueblo culture of Chaco Canyon \u201c decorated rocks throughout the regions with images of polydactyly and even had those with an extra appendage decorate walls by smooshing their feet into wet clay \u201d .\nAnd sculptures at the Maya site of Palenque ( PDF ) also portray individuals with six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most well-known ancient mention of polydactyly though is in the Bible , where in 2 Samuel 21:20 we find one of a number of stories under the \u2018 War Against the Philistines \u2019 involving battles against \u2018 giants \u2019 , or at least very large men ( redolent of the David vs Goliath story ) : It is in this passage that we find a possible link to the Karahan Tepe six-fingered carvings that I think many fringe researchers in alternative archaeology , ancient alien theory , or Biblical literalism might jump on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that these Biblical \u2018 giants \u2019 \u2013 and via this passage , people with six-fingers \u2013 might have been members of a lost civilisation , or a hybrid alien species , or the offspring of angelic beings , respectively .\nThis comes from a couple of passages in the Old Testament referring to a race of giants that lived before ( and after ) the great flood : The Nephilim were on the earth in those days \u2014 and also afterward \u2014 when the sons of God went in to the daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them .\nThese were the heroes that were of old , warriors of renown .\n( Genesis 6:4 ) So they brought to the Israelites an unfavorable report of the land that they had spied out , saying , \u201c The land that we have gone through as spies is a land that devours its inhabitants ; and all the people that we saw in it are of great size .\nThere we saw the Nephilim ( the Anakites come from the Nephilim ) ; and to ourselves we seemed like grasshoppers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Numbers 13:32-33 ) See , as an example of these associations , this segment from Ancient Aliens : A number of alternative history theories have also linked the culture that built Gobekli Tepe with the Nephilim \u2013 so the news that there are representations of six-fingered individuals there will surely be taken by some as supportive evidence for this idea .\nObviously , we don \u2019 t need to go as far as suggesting the presence of six-fingered statues at Karahan Tepe is proof of ancient aliens or angelic hybrids \u2013 polydactyly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetic mutation , so we don \u2019 t need to reach for out-of-the-box theories .\nHowever , the link is still interesting : polydactyly can be passed down within families as a genetic trait ( see below ) , so is it possible that just such a genetically distinct group with a high rate of polydactyly was responsible for the culture currently being unearthed in Turkey ( and perhaps helped spread civilization elsewhere ? )\n, and the mentions in the Bible and other stories , and artistic works , were mythical memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets of their ancestors that continued to exist and intermingled with other populations ) ?\nOf course , representations showing six-fingers could sometimes just be dumb mistakes by the artist ( or in some cases , mistakes by the observer , such as seeing a non-anatomically-correct depiction of a thumb as an extra finger ) , but when we find many of these images grouped together ( such as at Chaco Canyon , and apparently at Karahan Tepe ) , we would have to think that it is purposely describing people/beings actually having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases still be a symbolic or mythical representation of course .\nBut the relatively large amount of these images found at a number of very ancient sites seems to suggest that , from the very beginnings of human civilisation , people or beings with six fingers were revered for whatever reason .\nI don \u2019 t want to make too much of it , but it still seems like a thread worth pulling on to some extent .\nAs author Jim Vieira notes in the video below that provides a comprehensive look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with his pet research topic of ancient tales of giants ) : What do you make of all this ?\nIf you \u2019 re an academic you can pick away at pieces of this , but it \u2019 s tough to start talking about hybrids and gods and the supernatural and be taken seriously .\nSo you know I like to think of myself as a goodwill ambassador from the lunatic fringe and I just try to piece together this information\u2026I think there \u2019 s something to this , it is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , strapped down to a chair and forced to listen to me talk about this for an hour , will say \u2018 there \u2019 s something to this story , I don \u2019 t know truly what it is but it seems like there \u2019 s something here .\nI don \u2019 t agree with all Vieira \u2019 s theories ( or even all of the evidence presented in this video ) , but overall the topic is fascinating and Vieira \u2019 s lecture does a good job of displaying the impressively @ @ @

aviation ( the new Pentagon office is building relationships with the FAA and even NASA ) .\nAs such , the new identification group \u2013which has recently picked a new director\u2013 has the primary goal of bringing up UFO sightings from anecdotal data to rigorous science by standardizing reporting systems across all government departments and continue to reduce the stigma such reports still carry .\nIf you think you missed the part in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of a non-human presence in our world was seriously entertained by these G-men , it \u2019 s because they clearly aren \u2019 t considering it : Listening to Moultrie and Bray take turns to give their preliminary expositions it is evident that , just like Quintanilla and their predecessors , these Pentagon officials fully believe any ambiguous object in the sky can likely be identified with enough data as either \u2018 air clutter \u2019 ( drones , balloons , etc ) , adversarial platforms , or other natural phenomena .\nLacking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular report , they toss those \u201c unresolved \u201d cases on a convenient \u2018 Other \u2019 bin where they will probably keep everything from a party balloon passing by someone \u2019 s cockpit in the wink of an eye ( more on that later ) to even the notorious Tic-Tac sightings of the USS Nimitz in 2004 which captured the imagination of the entire world ; and rightly so , given the testimony of the pilots who came forward and the peculiar morphology and maneuvers of the object they claimed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are carefully constructing with the cases they are gathering , they were clear in their lack of interest to include in it whatever information has been gathered by civilian UFO groups like MUFON .\nWhich is in a way understandable due to legitimate concerns of \u2018 garbage in/garbage out \u2019 results when improper standard data gathering procedures are taken ; but remains nonetheless frustrating because \u2013just like Blue Book before them\u2013 it furthers the bias displayed by these government groups into focusing exclusively on a certain type of reports ( in the 1960s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the 2020s , only those filed by trained personnel and on secured/restricted zones ) .\nWhen asked expressly about it , Bray and Moultrie revealed the Pentagon is seeking cooperation from ally nations who have independent studies of UFOs abroad \u2013and they are even aware of a similar program to the UAP task force being carried out in China\u2013 but it is clear the exchange of information is very limited , and neither the Americans nor other nations are eager to share what they may or may not have learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealing too much .\nThe aura of secrecy is indeed something that has permeated the UFO narrative since the very beginning , and has aided to spawn such levels of speculation and mistrust toward government institutions to such degree , that nowadays we all feel the whole edifice of modern democracy is about to tumble down .\nBut Bray and Moultrie were emphatic during their public testimony that , despite their full commitment to public openness and transparency , if there is still a lot of secrecy regarding the cases investigated by previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do \u2013so they stated before the Committee\u2013 with covering up the existence of alien life from the public .\nInstead , they showed far more concern with safeguarding the vanguard military systems and modern multisensory arrays which are now permitting US vessels to detect and track the presence of UFOs within restricted airspace .\n\u201c We do not want our adversaries to know what we potentially can see or understand , or why we came to the conclusions we make , \u201d Bray said during the public part of the hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed session in which the most sensitive aspects of those sensor systems were probably revealed in more detail .\nThis is hardly the \u2018 Disclosure \u2019 UFO enthusiasts are hoping for , to say the least .\nAdding insult to injury , Bray also showed to the audience a video of a UFO taken by an aviator on board a Navy plane , perhaps as a way to demonstrate the reduced and fragmentary level of information they had to work with when piecing together the reports of most of the cases they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( taken with a regular cell phone ) showed what appeared to be a metallic looking spherical object for a fraction of a second ( a mylar balloon , perhaps ? )\nas the Navy plane passed beneath it at great speed ( the UFO , Bray explained , was flying at a very low speed in contrast ) .\nThe fact that the task force representatives didn \u2019 t even bother to make a low-speed version of the video , enlarge the object or even highlight its position on the screen for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and may have been intended to counter the mounting speculation fueled by Elizondo \u2019 s public comments that the US government is in possession of indisputable high quality footage of UFOs in close proximity which he was privy to before he quit \u2013or maybe it \u2019 s just a sign that video editing skills are not part of the requirements needed to land a job in the Pentagon .\nAnd speaking of videos , the biggest winner in this official exercise in transparency and accountability ( without even being present ! )\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the second and last video presented during the open audience was taken on board a Navy ship using an IR camera , which was originally leaked by filmmaker Jeremy Corbell , and promoted by him during every TV appearance he was a guest on , as \u2018 the best evidence \u2019 the US government had on UFOs .\nUnfortunately for George Knapp \u2019 s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and director of Bob Lazar : Area 51 & Flying Saucers , Bray confirmed to the Congressional Committee what Mick West had been saying all along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013the UFOs are nothing but drones , and their \u2018 pyramidal \u2019 shape is the result of a distortion caused by the lens of the camera , commonly known as bokeh .\nUnsurprisingly , Corbell has not backed down from his original claim and continues to maintain his anonymous informants were telling him the truth \u2013perhaps because he never cared to entertain the possibility he turned himself into an expendable pawn in a match between secret factions in the UFO camp .\nGiven the forgetful and forgiving nature of the UFO field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corbell continues to have a fruitful and profitable career in the obscure subculture of UFO conventions ( Roswell mummy anyone ? )\nyet outside sporadic appearances on Fox News I suspect his mainstream career is pretty much weaponized into oblivion by now .\nBut perhaps that should be the least of his worries , given how Congressman Darin LaHood asked Moultrie and Bray about possible legal and penal consequences for disseminating \u2018 self-serving \u2019 misinformation to the public with regards to UFOs .\nThis rather Orwellian mentality should probably not concern average citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013imagine the hornet nest you would create if you punished people for believing in weird shit\u2013 but maybe Moultrie was talking out of concern for the leaking of sensitive UFO-related material withheld by the DoD ; especially if it is material unauthorizedly leaked to the mainstream for promotional or commercial purposes .\nThe Q & A session with the two Pentagon bureaucrats felt disappointing when I watched it live .\nBut on a second viewing I \u2019 ve got to admit I was in hindsight pleasantly surprised with the line of questioning taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013after all , this is the first time in five decades the subject of unidentified flying objects has been brought back to the US House of Representatives .\nCongressman Adam Schiff , for example , who seemed to have been the only one who brought a copy of the UAP Task Force preliminary report which was released last year , was sure to take Bray to task by forcing him and his auxiliary staff to try and pause their first crappy iPhone UFO video so they could appropriately explain what anyone was supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nHe also was curious about the terminology used by the report in which it was stated that some of the objects reported were capable of \u2018 stationary flight \u2019 and some also didn \u2019 t show any \u2018 discernible means of propulsion \u2019 .\nBray was forced to concede that they are not aware of any US adversaries ( read Russia or China ) capable of doing that but speculated on how the apparent lack of visible propulsion systems could very well be the result of sensory artifacts ( lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jamming interference ) .\nQuintanilla would have been proud .\nCongressman Jim Himes was even bolder in asking if Bray \u2019 s team was in possession of any materials , organic or inorganic , that couldn \u2019 t be explained .\nHere Bray conceded his team has apparently recovered physical material from UFOs , but was adamant none of these artifacts or any other \u2018 emanations \u2019 detected by their sensory arrays suggest a non-terrestrial origin .\nThis bucket of cold water will certainly not deter those who were already promoting these initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of UFOs *cough Maussan cough* I particularly liked Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi \u2019 s questions , which forced Bray to reveal there have been at least eleven near-collisions with UFOs that his task force is aware of .\nBray also confirmed there has been no attempt to discharge weapons against these objects ( smart move ) and ( curious enough ) not even any attempt to establish any communications with them .\nBray tried to deflect the question by alluding to the small size of most of the objects reported in the sightings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though the literature is ripe with cases of miniature UFOs\u2013 and yet the Tic-Tac encountered by the Nimitz aviator was the size of a jet fighter .\nWhy not trying to \u2018 hail \u2019 the object instead of just chasing it down ?\nBut perhaps the boldest of the questions came from Congressman Mike Gallagher , who has instantly become a new hero of the UFO community due to his apparent knowledge of the modern mythos .\nNot only did he exposed Moultrie and Bray \u2019 s ignorance about previous official attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013project Sign and Grudge ( so what else don \u2019 t they know ? )\n\u2013 but his inquiry seemed carefully targeted into expressly shedding light into any possible \u2018 black projects \u2019 withing the government which have allegedly looked into the UFO problem behind the curtain .\nHe directly requested Moultrie and Bray to look into the famous Malmstrom AFB UFO incident of 1967 , in which an unidentified object allegedly interfered with the nuclear weapons stored within that installation , and he even successfully submitted the controversial Wilson memo to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFor those of you not wasting you time in the murky UFO subculture ( lucky bastards ) the Wilson memo is considered by some activists \u2013especially the younger members in the field\u2013 to be convincing evidence of ultra-secret programs withing the government with zero oversight seeking to harness the secrets of UFO recovered technology .\nMany pundits already criticize Gallagher for giving unwarranted importance to such an improbable piece of UFO lore \u2013after all , if the Wilson memo is true and Bob Lazar is also telling the truth , then Elizondo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasting their time and the answer to the UFO mystery has already been found .\nWhy keep analyzing blurry videos when you have a bunch of crashed saucers stored in Area 51 , yo ?\n\u2013 but on the other hand perhaps it is high time the people running the US government turned around and recognized how the rampant lack of oversight in special access programs ( SAPs ) is one of the reasons why conspiracies like these gain such a strong acceptance among the public .\nThe fact a big number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the person freely elected by the people to run the country ) would NOT be necessarily briefed on whatever secrets the military industrial complex may or may not have on UFOs , is in many ways a bigger societal problem than the supposed UFO cover-up itself .\nPerhaps Gallagher \u2019 s little stint might at least help kickstart a movement to correct that , even if the memo turns out to be bogus .\nThere is a lot more that could be said about these \u2018 historical \u2019 hearings \u2013for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two most visible leaders of the modern Disclosure movement , not even mentioned during the procedures ?\n\u2013 but in the end I feel the most important thing which could be extracted from last Tuesday \u2019 s exercise is how the public should stop looking for answers to the UFO question from the US government .\nYes , they have more resources ; but even those are limited and the ones in charge are not interested in losing their jobs and pensions by pursuing any possible obscure lead they might find on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTheir purpose is clear : to keep their citizens safe , and EVERYTHING else is secondary \u2013that , mind you , doesn \u2019 t make them \u2018 the baddies.\n\u2019 They \u2019 re just doing their job with what they \u2019 ve got .\nAs such , we should instead encourage that independent scientific organizations such as SCU , the Galileo Project or many others , gain as much access to the data guarded by AOIMSG as they can possibly get ; already Moultrie showed a concern to ensure their info doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red tape as to become inaccessible to people who might be in a better position to exploit it .\nOtherwise , those \u201c unresolved cases \u201d might linger in the \u2018 Other \u2019 bin indefinitely\u2026 just like it happened to Blue Book .\nAre there any private groups with privileged access to UFO information ( even possible recovered materials ) that remain impervious to US Congressional oversight ?\nMaybe , but who the hell cares ?\n?\nThe US government doesn \u2019 t have a complete dominion on the atmosphere last time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other things that have to be addressed aside from adding more cameras and sensors like Avi Loeb wants .\nA new scientific revolution needs to happen before we can begin to ask better questions \u2013and it is already happening , if you know where to look .\nA careful study of history shows that most of the time once the cultural breakthrough happens , political oversight slowly drags on trying to catch up with the new paradigm .\nWhy do we think UFOs would be any different ?", "author": "red pill junkie", "url":

Ariel Phenomenon (Film Review)", "content": "As I wrote on a previous article when the trailer for Ariel Phenomenon came out , I tend to end up being disappointed with UFO-related documentaries because they are not intended for me as the main audience .\nThe filmmakers are more interested in convincing skeptics ( good luck with that ) or tantalize undecided viewers with the possibility those silly flying saucers \u2013which have invaded our pop culture in anything from cereal boxes to Hollywood blockbusters\u2013 might be actually real after all .\nLike , for real .\nI was , however , expecting something more from this particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain personal connection with it for a very long time : I was already in college in 1994 when the story of an alleged UFO landing in some remote school in Zimbabwe attained global attention .\nLike almost all who are obsessed with this phenomenon I became instantly enamored with the small children which were the witnesses of this close encounter ; they all looked so unbelievably cute with their neat school uniforms , their sincere voices with a tinge of British accent ( the remnants of African colonialism ) and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best to respond to the questions of investigators and TV reporters , it was almost impossible not to believe these children were sincere .\nMy interest in the Ariel case was rekindled in 2016 , when I was fortunate enough to accompany my friend Greg Bishop to the Open Minds UFO Conference in Arizona .\nAs luck would have it , that was the year Emily Trim \u2013one of the Ariel school children , and in many ways the main protagonist of the film\u2013 was invited to give a presentation ; the raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how difficult it has been for her to live with this experience , even more than 20 years after it happened , caused the whole audience to give her a standing ovation .\nOf all the available DVDs of the conference \u2019 s presentations , her is the only one I bothered to buy .\nSo , like I said , I was expecting quite a lot from this documentary which has been officially released today , and I am happy to report my expectations were fulfilled .\nThe film , directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with historic footage along with modern interviews , gives the viewer proper context on the strange wave of UFO sightings that befell upon the fledgling African republic of Zimbabwe ( which was at the time suffering from riots and protests over the dictatorial rule of President Mugabe ) .\nIt was under these circumstances that the Ariel close encounter took place , and Tim Leach ( a BBC war correspondent stationed in the country at the time ) was not only responsible for the international notoriety the case took initially , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychiatrist John Mack to investigate it .\nMack , whose academic credentials had turned him into the most notorious personality championing the phenomenon known as \u2018 alien abductions \u2019 as something that deserved serious scientific scrutiny , also brought the Ariel case to the attention of the American mainstream media , including Oprah .\nAll this kitschy popularity didn \u2019 t sit well with Mack \u2019 s colleagues at Harvard who felt he had gone too far with this \u201c alien hobby \u201d of his .\nThe movie spends considerable time showing Mack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after being run over by a truck driver due to his own imprudence ( he forgot to look to the opposite way before crossing the street ) \u2013 as something of a martyr figure who was put under investigation and was even close to lose his tenure , until the Dean dropped all charges and issued a public apology .\nLeach \u2019 s career also suffered greatly for paying attention to a story his bosses at the Beeb considered to be poppycock , and here it is interesting to notice how often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left \u2019 to act far more reactionarily than the \u2018 conservative right \u2019 .\nAs an example of this , the film shown an interview with a certain Arnold Relman , MD \u2013who I nicknamed the \u2018 Grand Inquisitor \u2019 while watching the film\u2013 who was the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine at the time , and was appointed by the Dean of Harvard University to look into John \u2019 s practice for fear of any \u2018 violation of medical standards \u2019 ( BS , they were worried about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry King ) .\nSpeaking with an insufferably arrogant tone to the camera , Relman kept complaining on how Mack \u2019 s theories were dangerous because they promoted \u201c the cult of mysticism and magic.\n\u201d And at one point he says , \u201c If ( Mack \u2019 s patients ) were ( abducted ) then the whole world as we know it is upside down !\n\u201d Yeah well\u2026 maybe it is ?\nI am aware many pundits in the UFO world will take issue with the fact Randall the director is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain highly controversial even among believers of the phenomenon\u2013 with the Ariel case , and yet no one could deny both the people who claim to have been taken by spindly gray beings from their bedroom and the Ariel children suffered a similar social stigma throughout their lives .\nSomething confirmed by the numerous testimonies of Ariel witnesses collected by this film , confessing how difficult it has been for them to live with the weight of their close encounter experience for most of their lives , without rarely having the chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories .\n\u201c My husband doesn \u2019 t even know about it , \u201d Emma Kristiansen , one of the witnesses , bravely confesses in front of the camera .\nImagine the sense of alienation ( pun not intended ) of carrying that kind of secret all of your life and being afraid to share it with your own partner !\n\u2013if you have been a victim of abuse , I am sure you can .\nNo clearer example of this struggle could have been shown than in the story of Emily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case back in 2016 , and who is in many ways the emotional backbone keeping the whole thing glued together .\nShe became an artist , and her expressionistic paintings perfectly capture her inner struggles of not only having witnessed something which openly defies the stability of reality , as Grand Inquisitor Relman feared , but the silent despair of not being able to talk about it with her own family .\nHaving been raised in a deeply religious and conservative household , she and her brother \u2013who was also a witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviewed for this film\u2013 were never allowed to openly discuss what they have witnessed with her missionary parents , for whom their Christian faith and Western acculturation simply did not allow for any sort of filing box in which to categorize their children \u2019 s experience .\nOne of Emily \u2019 s most striking paintings is that of a girl with pigtails \u2013such as the ones she used to have when she went to school at Ariel\u2013 with her mouth zipped shut .\nAnd yet , there are other cultures in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences might be easier and more natural .\nThe documentary transforms into a journey of healing for Emily , who decides to accept an invitation to go back to Zimbabwe to participate in the 25th anniversary of the school .\nWalking across the old school ground where she used to play as a girl and having the chance to reconnect with a few of her schoolmates and former teachers \u2013who by the way seemed to have all taken the best attitude possible of believing their students saw something , while not necessarily taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been incredibly therapeutic to her .\nThe other part of the healing process came from her meeting with some local tribal leaders and \u2018 medicine men \u2019 , who kept assuring Emily that what she and the other kids went through is no different from the kind of spiritual experiences their people have had for generations .\n\u201c If you want a message to be delivered , it has to be delivered to children , \u201d Duke Monzowa ( son and apprentice of Village chief Goromonzi ) tells the camera .\nComparisons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film \u2019 s approach to exploring different cultural interpretations to the UFO phenomenon ( closer to spiritual/mystical events than the nuts-and-bolts explanations favored by Western researchers ) felt pleasantly reminiscent to another documentary I highly recommend : Witness of Another World .\nMonzowa \u2019 s words help us make yet another inconvenient comparison I can not help to think of \u2013one that sadly wasn \u2019 t made by this documentary\u2013 between the Ariel case and another highly notorious event in which children were the primary witnesses : I am of course talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which many of the things reported by the Ariel witnesses were also present : flashes of light , buzzing sounds like that of bees , and ( more importantly ) some type of telepathic communication in which the children received terrible visions .\nIn the case of the Ariel children , the visions seemed to have been connected to environmental collapse and our mistreat of the natural world ; in the case of Fatima , the second \u201c prophecy \u201d revealed to Lucia ( the main witness ) was interpreted by the Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with human bodies wringing in a sea of melting sulfur .\nBut what if those visions were not of an eternal torment bestowed by a vengeful god , but another vision of things that have yet to pass ?\nMight not the scenes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the fall of the atomic bombs in 1945 seem as an infernal realm to an illiterate child in the year 1917 ?\n* Once again , cultural interpretation is of paramount importance when dealing with this phenomenon .\n\u201c ( These ) are spiritual messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monzowa tells a nervous Emily .\n\u201c You have to share it .\nYou have to shout !\n\u201d he firmly says while laughing to reassure her .\nShe laughs back in response and nods her head .\nThe little girl with the cute pig tails is finally zipping open her mouth and speaking up .\nLike her , many other of the Ariel witnesses \u2013now spread all across the world due to Zimbabwe \u2019 s political turmoil in the 1990 \u2019 s\u2013 are also finding the courage to raise their voice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep black eyes of the strange entities that appeared before them almost three decades ago .\nMost of that message will not be pleasant to our ears , who have grown so used to the comforts brought by modern technology .\nAnd yet , the warning received by the Ariel children is clear : our world and our own survival are in danger precisely because we have grown too \u201c technologed \u201d , to use the very words of Emma back when she was a young girl answering the questions of Dr. Mack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technophilic approach exhibited by most UFO enthusiasts , who firmly believe the disclosure of alien-reversed technologies is the only thing that can save us now ; but it most certainly agrees with the stern messages given by other \u2018 primitive \u2019 cultures who are not impressed by our plastic gadgets and see them instead as distractions to the larger world of Spirit .\nWho is right , the people who built atom bombs or the people who have lived on this planet for thousands of years ?\nWhen talking about the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cameras , Dr. John Mack adamantly said , \u201c this event should persuade people.\n\u201d 28 years ago I really believed that .\nBut now it \u2019 s 2022 and the Ariel school children have grown into adults much older than I was in 1994 , and neither I nor they have gotten any definitive answers about what \u2019 s really going on .\nOh sure , some of the stigma surrounding the phenomenon has been lifted as of late , but almost all of that new openness is reserved to military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely perceived in terms of advanced technology .\nIf those Navy aviators were talking about apocalyptic visions of the future instead , I very much doubt there would be any US Congressmen willing to risk their political necks by discussing about it on the record .\nAnd yet documentaries like these are thankfully being made to remind us that the UFO mystery is bigger , richer , and far deeper than paranoid discussions of national security and \u2018 counterintelligence threats \u2019 .\nListening to the voices of these children-turned-adults , it is clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end managed to bravely live with the uncertainty of their experience , and somehow incorporate it into their personal belief system to give them a profound sense of humility .\nIt is perhaps this humility shared by children of different backgrounds , races and social circumstances , what may be behind the whole point of this fascinating encounter in the end .\n\u201c The world is a beautiful and strange place .\nAnd we \u2019 re just human beings .\nWe can \u2019 t know everything.\n\u201d Those are the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is a lesson we can all be reminded of every time we stop looking at our cell phones and raise our gaze into the night sky .\nAriel Phenomenon is now available for renting .\nGo watch it now .\n( * ) : Another old case which has recently gotten a lot of attention thanks to the book Trinity by Jacques Vallee and Paola Harris , also involves children as witnesses and the witnesses claim to have had received telepathic visions of tall buildings collapsing , which are strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to take place\u2026 like 9/11 .", "author": "red pill junkie", "url":

conspiracy theorists", "content": "The radicalisation of politics in the United States continues apace with Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Kandiss Taylor making the news for suggesting that corrupt officials might face death by firing squad if she is elected .\nIt wasn \u2019 t the first outrageous thing the \u2018 Jesus , Guns , Babies \u2019 candidate has said , after previously also making the somewhat backward argument that Native Americans had sacrificed their lands and lives so that modern Americans could worship Jesus .\nSo it \u2019 s not particularly surprising to discover that a key part of Taylor \u2019 s campaign platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Stonehenge-like granite monument constructed some four decades ago near Elberton , Georgia , that has for many years attracted the attention of conspiracy theorists who believe it contains a message from [ insert your evil secret society of choice ] about the mass killing of the population of Earth .\nIn a pinned tweet with a campaign video , she promises to \u201c DEMOLISH the Georgia Guidestones \u201d if elected governor , due to its links to a hypothesised Satanic Regime/Luciferian Cabal : \u201c Over four billion people have been injected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create \u2013 ask yourself why \u201d , Taylor says , as the video shows the Georgia Guidestones \u2019 infamous inscription \u201c Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 \u201d \u2013 likely riffing on an anti-vaxx conspiracy suggesting that the COVID-19 vaccine has been designed to kill off a large proportion of the population of Earth .\nTaylor , who ran a losing campaign for the US Senate in 2020 , also makes reference to the toppling of Confederate statues , as well as perhaps to the installation of a statue of Baphomet at the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c We \u2019 ve watched as people have destroyed our history and monuments , and in their place they have erected statues to their own gods .\nThe New World Order is here , and they told us it was coming.\n\u201d \u201c It is a war between good and evil , \u201d Taylor says , as the video ends with her standing before the controversial monument , with the overlaid text \u201c Executive Order 10 : Demolish the Georgia Guidestones \u201d and a link to more information on her website .\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following message : For decades , the Global Luciferian Regime has seeped its way into our Government .\nThey demoralized us with humiliation rituals as they tore down our historical monuments , persecuted our children , locked us down in our homes , and forced us into becoming walking science experiments through a global vaccination program .\nThey erected statues spelling out the exact plans they had for us , and today we the people of Georgia , say no more .\nIt \u2019 s time for us to return the favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Georgia , I will move to DEMOLISH the Demonic plans of our enemy .\nThe Satanic agenda is NOT welcome in our state .\nSupport my fight by contributing , and watch as I turn the Georgia Guidestones into dust !\nAs I \u2019 ve discussed previously , the fixation that a number of conspiracy theorists have with the Georgia Guidestones being an advertisement for a global depopulation program is a born out of a misunderstanding about the function of the monument : rather than a billboard for a coming , purposeful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beacon for survivors of any future apocalypse ( probably nuclear , given when it was created ) to guide them in how to reconstruct society , and is based on Masonic myths related to stone monuments bearing knowledge and wisdom for survivors of the Great Flood .\nIt \u2019 s still worth being concerned about some of its messages ( \u201c Guide reproduction wisely , improving fitness and diversity \u201d certainly has a flavour of eugenics about it ) , but the message about maintaining population below 500 million is meant as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rebuilding process , not as a threat to people of today .\nAnd yes , it is kind of an absurd suggestion to say that a secret society would create a billboard of sorts to explicitly advertise its plans to exterminate 90 % of the world \u2019 s population \u2013 but it \u2019 s worth noting that the start of Taylor \u2019 s video features a text grab of the writings of Christian conspiracy theorist Michael A. Hoffmann II ( Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare ) related to what he called \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain point during a conspiracy , he says , where secret societies explicitly brag about/make it known what they are doing because they are no longer afraid of consequences and want to reinforce their dominance over the general public .\nThankfully ( at least in terms of the Georgia Guidestones ) , there is little chance of Kandiss Taylor being elected to office , as there are two more high-profile Republican candidates well ahead of her in the pecking order .\nBut it is just one more reminder of how conspiracy theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remain a major talking point in American society and politics .", "author": "Greg", "url":

"date": "2022-05-30", "source": "dailygrail", "title": "Q&A with Ariel Phenomenon Director Randall Nickerson", "content": "Recently I wrote a review for the new UFO documentary Ariel Phenomenon , which would be greatly enjoyed by anyone who has been following TDG for any number of years , since instead of trying to make a case for extraterrestrial visitation it strives instead to present the \u2018 human angle \u2019 to the alien mystery As a plus to our readers , the director Randall Nickerson was also kind enough to answer a few questions via email .\nHere they are : \u2022 Of all the plethora of stories of close encounters with non-human intelligences from all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nRN : I chose this case because of the plethora of witnesses , which made it unique .\nAnd the fact of the witnesses are children was particularly fascinating to me .\n\u2022 What was the most challenging aspect about presenting this story in film format ?\nRN : Getting the funding was the biggest hurdle [ the film was produced thanks to a successful crowdfunding campaign ] .\nThe hardest part was that I had to shoot it , and I \u2019 m glad I did , but it was challenging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , film it , record sound .\n\u2022 Were there any of the children who refused to appear in the film ?\nIf so , why ?\nRN : Yes , a lot of them were spoken to but didn \u2019 t feel comfortable being in an interview on camera .\nThey didn \u2019 t want the ridicule , they didn \u2019 t want to interrupt their lives .\nThere were more people that said that , than were in the film .\n\u2022 Are there instances of repeating contacts or manifestations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are aware of ?\nRN : I \u2019 m not at liberty to discuss this , that \u2019 s something that \u2019 s up to them to share .\n\u2022 The story of Emily [ one of the witnesses ] and her return to Ariel feels like the emotional backbone of the whole movie , and showed that her journey toward healing was very arduous .\nBut what about even more negative outcomes ?\nAre there cases of substance abuse , broken relationships , etc , among some of the Ariel witnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trauma of the experience ?\nRN : That is a question for them , and they \u2019 d have to be ready to discuss that themselves .\nBut yes , those are a few ways that this , or any kind , of trauma effects experiencers \u2019 lives .\n\u2022 Were there things about the story you didn \u2019 t know before embarking on this project that totally surprised you ?\nRN : Yes \u2013 I didn \u2019 t know about Tim Leach [ the BBC correspondent to brought attention to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mack ] , I didn \u2019 t know that so many individuals from the press interviewed the children , and I didn \u2019 t know there were witnesses outside of Ariel , not specific to the school .\n\u2022 Were there things you wanted to include in the movie but were unable to ?\nRN : Absolutely \u2013 the other witnesses that were from outside of Ariel school , I interviewed about 70 of them , from before and after the day of the event .\nBut it just wouldn \u2019 t fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell , and we had to decide on what to focus on .\n\u2022 Were there unexpected/synchronistic events that happened to you or your crew during the production of the project ?\nRN : Oh yeah .\nWhich one ( s ) should I start with ?\nA lot of moments on the African production trips .\nA lot of dangerous wildlife that didn \u2019 t bother us but could have .\nOne night we were far off in the dark , Chris and I , where jaguars and lions roam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up so easily .\nThere are dozens of stories like that from my adventures in Africa over the three trips I took for the film .\nI got chased by an elephant , a rhino , a female lion .\nIt was a lot .\nBut it all turned out well .\n\u2022 Are there any other UFO/paranormal cases you would like to get involved with in future projects ?\nRN : Definitely .\nBut I can \u2019 t discuss these projects right now at the risk of others covering them .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about .\n\u2022 Have you had anomalous experiences yourself ?\nRN : I have .\nThat \u2019 s a whole story in itself , but at this time I \u2019 m keeping the story about the Ariel School students , because that \u2019 s who this story is about , and they \u2019 ve the important ones right now .\nMy story will be told eventually .\nWe are very grateful with Randall for answering our questions , and the fact there are aspects about the Ariel case he didn \u2019 t have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( like the witnesses outside the school ) doesn \u2019 t surprise me in the least .\nMy gut tells me not only that we will never know the full story of what really went on that school playground in Zimbabwe in 1994 , but also that we haven \u2019 t heard the last from the Ariel witnesses , who may be now ready to share more about their incredible experiences .\nAriel Phenomenon is available for online rent at the official website .", "author": "red

personalities from various vanguard disciplines , ranging from transpersonal psychology , remote viewing , to the study of life after death .\nAnd now it was the turn of my friend and mentor Greg Bishop , one of the most reasoned voices in the field of UFOlogy \u2013which unfortunately tends to pay far too much attention to those making sensationalistic claims .\nThe subject of the above interview is the role the government of the United States has played in the creation and dissemination of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects ; something Bishop is keenly aware of after writing the seminal book Project Beta , which explored the tragic story of Paul Bennewitz : an American engineer who had a deep interest in UFOs and came to believe he had uncovered evidence of nefarious alien incursions at the Kirtland Air Force base in New Mexico .\nBut rather than dissuading him , the government agencies operating at Kirtland encouraged Bennewitz in his delusions , thus propelling him into a

promoting some Navy videos an anonymous source leaked to him as \u201c the best available evidence \u201d the US government had on the existence of UFOs , only to be finally confirmed they were unmanned aerial vehicles ( drones ) swarming the Navy vessels from a ship with a Hong Kong flag .\nAs Greg has said in many interviews , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful about falling into the trap of shady government agents who lure naive researchers by appealing to their ego and sense of self-importance ( \u201c oh wow , if this spook is contacting me that means I \u2019 m special !\n\u201c ) , and if those spooks end up telling you exactly what you want to hear to confirm your personal bias about the UFO phenomenon , that should be seen as a red flag that you \u2019 re about to be Bennewitz

\u2019 ?\nThat \u2019 s one of the theories that has been bandied about since an initial teaser trailer for the new movie from award-winning film-maker Jordan Peele was released earlier this year that \u2013 while not showing much \u2013 did show plenty of characters looking up at the sky ( and a short scene that appeared to show the top of the head of a small \u2018 grey \u2019 alien ) before ending with one of the lead characters being pulled up into the sky .\nWell the final trailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop on 22 July , seems to confirm that it \u2019 s all about them UFOs ( and related topics , as we \u2019 ll discuss below ) , as it explicitly shows what appears to be a stonking great flying saucer chasing another lead character down a dirt road in broad daylight .\nCheck it out : For those that don \u2019 t mind knowing a bit before seeing the actual movie , the international trailer offers some additional context : The trailers certainly bring more of the same creepy vibes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Us .\nBut two elements in particular piqued my interest , as they seem to reference ( knowingly or not ) cases from ufological history\u2026.one from half a century ago , another more recent .\nThe first is alluded to not just by the movie \u2019 s setting \u2013 a horse ranch \u2013 but also possibly in several scenes in the trailers : a panicked horse running , a horse \u2019 s head crashing through a windscreen ( I think ? )\n, and lastly a horse possibly being used as \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the poster for the film which shows a horse levitating in the sky ( see the image at the top of this post ) .\nThose who know their UFO history , in particular the topic of \u2018 mutes \u2019 ( livestock mutilations ) , might see a call-back here to the famous case of \u2018 Snippy the Horse \u2019 \u2013 one of the original \u2018 mutes \u2019 , dating back to 1967 .\nOn September 9 of that year , on a ranch near the town of Alamosa in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 3-year-old Appaloosa ( according to a number of sources , \u2018 Snippy \u2019 was not actually the horse \u2019 s name ) was found two days after it had gone missing .\nBut , shockingly , the corpse was found with the neck and head of the horse completely stripped of flesh , while the rest of the body was intact .\nSo the story goes , no blood was found on or around the body , and a number of darkened patches like scorch marks were found in the vicinity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards away was a shrub which was squashed nearly flat , and six small , round indentations in the ground in the shape of a circle .\nAnd so the legend emerged ( to William of Occam \u2019 s horror ) , that aliens were responsible .\nIn the decade following , it was cattle , not horses , that became the \u2018 stars \u2019 of the livestock mutilation story , with thousands of reported cases \u2013 so much so that most people now refer to the mystery as \u2018 cattle mutilations \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern cases was that of a horse .\nLinda Moulton Howe \u2019 s 1980 documentary on the phenomenon A Strange Harvest catapulted the phenomenon into mainstream conversations , where it has remained ever since .\nAs for Snippy , there is no resting in peace just yet : a few months ago Snippy hit the news again due to the horse \u2019 s skeleton being bought as a feature for a roadside UFO attraction , the UFO Watchtower .\nAnd it \u2019 s possible that Peele \u2019 s Nope might bring the myth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus again , 55 years after Snippy \u2019 s mysterious death .\nThe other element of the trailers for Nope that reminded me of a part of UFO history was the setting up of cameras to monitor the ranch for UFO activity , bringing to mind the infamous Skinwalker Ranch and the alleged paranormal activity \u2013 including livestock mutilations \u2013 reported at that location .\nThe ranch first came to public prominence in the book Hunt for the Skinwalker , authored by Colm Kelleher and George Knapp ( we reviewed the book and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , though over time the mythology has grown and more recently it has featured in Jeremy Corbell \u2019 s documentary with the same name as the book , and even has its own History Channel series devoted to it , The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch .\nThe latter coverage \u2013 since the ranch changed hands from Robert Bigelow to Brandon Fugal \u2013 also feels right in line with Nope \u2018 s apparent storyline of the ranch owners trying to get the best UFO footage out there in the mold of online influencers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be interesting to see how Jordan Peele ends up treating the subject when the movie is released next month .\nBetween the UFO-related topics that are likely to be covered , Jordan Peele \u2019 s excellent sensibilities for making creepy horror cinema , and appearances by two of the greatest voices in movies ( Keith David , 40 years on from his role in John Carpenter \u2019 s The Thing , and Michael Wincott ) , I \u2019 ll definitely be checking Nope out at the first opportunity !", "author": "Greg", "url": "https://www.dailygrail.com/2022/06/jordan-peeles-nope-borrowing-from-ufology-old-and-new/", "published": "Tue, 21

Time When NASA Was Asked to Look into the UFO Problem, and Said NOPE", "content": "Earlier this month NASA officially announced they are commissioning an independent study on UAPs ( the sanitized acronym replacing UFOs everyone has to use now to be taken seriously ) .\nThe goal of the study , which will focus on available data \u2013including what has been gathered by civilian organizations\u2013 and is expected to spend no more than US $ 100,000 , is to create \u2018 an open roadmap \u2019 for future inquiries on UFOs \u201c by applying the tools of science to shed light on their nature and origin.\n\u201d Indeed , that \u2019 s what they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you NASA was once expressly asked by the White House to conduct a scientific study on UFOs\u2026 and they flat out refused ?\nIt all started back in 1976 , when Jimmy Carter was running for president .\nUnlike most politicians , Carter didn \u2019 t shy away from the UFO question and was in fact very open about his own close encounter sighting , which happened in 1969 while he was still governor of Georgia .\nCarter , who was perceived as an outsider by Washington D.C. \u2019 s hoi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform of renewed transparency in government ; a breath of fresh air after the stench of the CIA mind-control programs and Watergate still lingered in the corridors of power .\nThat pledge of openness was also extended to UFOs : During a campaign stop on March 31 , candidate Carter made a promise to release all available data which might be withheld by the government to the public , provided it didn \u2019 t compromise national security .\nCivilian UFO organizations were elated , especially because it was around this time that stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US military \u2013including the diminutive bodies of their non-human occupants\u2013 were beginning to attain prominence in the field .\nResearcher Leonard Stringfield gathered dozens of such claims from different retired or acting military personnel , but unfortunately these compelling accounts were never substantiated by any tangible evidence .\nIn 1977 Carter was inaugurated , and the White House began to be flooded with letters from private citizens and groups demanding the new president to make good on his \u2018 UFO pledge \u2019 .\nAccording to Richard Dolan \u2019 s UFOs and the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Press Secretary Jody Powell and Science Advisor Frank Press were entrusted to look into the matter of a possible cover-up of UFO information .\n\u201c Within the first months of the new administration , \u201d Dolan writes , \u201c they asked the CIA and Pentagon if they were withholding documents ; both agencies said no.\n\u201d The correspondence of concerned citizens enquiring the White House about UFOs was turning critical .\nAccording to Dolan , the Congressional Liaison Office directed by Frank Moore received over 9000 letters .\nOverwhelmed and understaffed , Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On July 21 , Press wrote a letter to Dr. Robert A. Frosch , NASA administrator , suggesting the space agency to become \u201c the focal point for the UFO question \u201d : answering all UFO-related letters from the public , but also conducting an active search program .\nIn essence , as Dolan put it in his book , Press was asking NASA to launch a successor to the Air Force \u2019 s project Blue Book .\n\u201c Since it has been nearly a decade since the Condon report , \u201d Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small panel of inquiry could be formed to see if there any new significant findings.\n\u201d It is clear that both Frosch and his NASA colleagues weren \u2019 t interested in the slightest to jump to the UFO bandwagon at the request of the Carter administration .\nBy that time , they were too busy planning the launching of the Voyager 1 and 2 space probes , which were designed to collect information about Jupiter and the outer planets in the solar system , and eventually venture into deep space .\nIt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility of intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe \u2013which is why both Voyager craft carried a golden disc with recorded sounds intended to offer a glimpse of life in planet Earth and human civilization , in case they were ever found by extraterrestrial beings in the future\u2013 but that is different from assuming ET has actually landed on our world .\nBy the 1970s the Condon Report mentioned by Frost on his letter had done an effective job in convincing most scientists that investigating UFO reports carried no scientific value .\nOn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second letter to Frosch , further requesting NASA to take the lead on the UFO situation .\nThe White House \u2019 s intentions to set up a new \u201c UFO office \u201d became public .\nOn his Forbidden Science journal ( Vol .\n2 ) , Dr. Jacques Vall\u00e9e mentions how Peter Sturrock , a physics professor at Stanford University and a longtime collaborator of his , wrote a letter to Press offering his services as consultant ; a valiant gesture that was unfortunately not taken into consideration , because both Press and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in investigating UFOs \u2013they just wanted to get rid of the PR problem they represented .\nResponding to Press and the White House , Frosch had accepted the request to respond to UFO-related mail from the public , but regarding the possibility to launch Blue Book 2.0 , he had asked for more time to address the situation .\nInside NASA , a sad game of bureaucratic \u201c tag game \u201d began : Frosch delegated the problem to Karl Henize , of the science division , who in turn passed it on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of astrophysics .\nAs Vallee describes it in Forbidden Science , Vol .\n2 : At the same time , Frosch had began to make inquiries through the grapevine with other government agencies ; both the CIA and the Air Force were advising NASA to avoid the UFO hot potato at all costs .\nOn September 1st , according to Dolan \u2019 s book , Colonel Charles Senn , Chief of USAF Community Relations Division , wrote to Lt. General Duward Crow of NASA : On September 30th , Vallee had a meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Office of Scientific and Technology Policy ( Frank Press \u2019 s assistant ) on Washington D.C. ( the encounter appears in both the prologue of Vallee \u2019 s Messengers of Deception , as well as in page 398 of Forbidden Science , Vol .\n2. )\n.\nSince the publication of his seminal Passport to Magonia in 1969 , Vallee had disavowed the extraterrestrial origin of the UFO phenomenon as it is maintained by the majority of people interested in the phenomenon \u2013including skeptics .\nHe asked Schneider why was NASA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astrophysicists , was picked by the Carter administration to conduct a new look into a phenomenon which has never been proven to be neither technological in nature nor originated in space , when other government agencies might be better equipped with dealing with the most confounding physical aspects of UFOs ; like the Department of Energy , or even the National Institute of Health , given the physiological responses found among close encounter witnesses .\nIn Messengers of Deception , Vallee writes Schneider \u2019 s response : to the public UFOs have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the one looking into it .\nIt was clear to Vallee the White House was addressing the UFO problem the same way their predecessors have always had \u2013as a public relations issue , and nothing more .\nIn Forbidden Science , Vol .\n2 , Vallee offers more intriguing details about this meeting : Indeed , the Carter administration was dealing with other uncontrollable reactions elsewhere : The energy crisis of the 1970s was not over , things in the Middle East between the Arabs and Israelis were beginning to heat up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the American-supported Shah were beginning ; a situation which escalated into the Islamic revolution that would bring the Ayatollah Khomeini into power and climaxed with the hostage crisis of 1979 .\nUFOs were simply not a top priority .\nNot even when Prime Minister Eric Gairy of Grenada delivered a speech before the United Nations asking for an international effort to investigate the phenomenon .\nHis pleas fell into deaf ears , and by late October NASA scientist Herbert Rowe wrote to MUFON to tell them that \u201c at the present moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study UFOs .\nThree days before Christmas , Frosch replied to Frank Press to officially decline the White House request .\nAccording to Frosch , they would agree on continuing to respond to mail inquiries from citizens , but a check with the CIA had convinced him that there was no evidence to the UFO reality , and he emphasized the problem of devising a \u201c sound scientific procedure \u201d to investigate what could clearly be an elusive phenomenon .\nA White House press release on December 27 officially accepted NASA \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter any further .\nIt is as if UFO enthusiasts all across the United States had received a lump of coal that Christmas .\nWhy did President Carter decide to forget about his UFO pledge so easily ?\nAccording to Dolan \u2019 s book , shortly after his election in November 1976 , Carter met with then-CIA director George Bush so the president-elect could be briefed on issues of national security .\nIt was during this meeting , according to Daniel Sheehan \u2013an attorney associated with Citizens Against UFO Secrecy ( CAUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in controversial UFO politics ( he is currently representing whistle-blower Luis Elizondo against the supposed attempts to discredit him\u2013 when Carter ( allegedly ) asked Bush to be briefed about whatever information the agency may have on UFOs .\nBush refused , claiming the President hadn \u2019 t the proper \u2018 need-to-know \u2019 , but that he was willing to hand over their UFO material if Carter kept him at the head of the CIA .\nCarter refused .\nThere \u2019 s also another story gathered in Dolan \u2019 s book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an anonymous source , referring to a close aide to Carter who one day walked into the Oval office in June of 1977 , shortly after the President had been briefed on matters related to UFOs .\nAccording to the source , the president was \u201c sobbing , with his head on his hands , nearly on his desk.\n\u201d The allusion being that whatever answers Carter did get from the gatekeepers of the UFO cover-up withing the government , they deeply disturbing .\nRegardless of whatever Carter may or may not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White Hose , 44 years have passed and now it seems as if NASA is willing to reconsider the potential scientific value of photographs and videos \u2013given how there is little more than that which have been publicly disclosed since the publication of the 2017 New York Times article , which sparked the current renewed interest in UFOs .\nThere \u2019 s a chance NASA officials have been secretly briefed on the issue , along with members of Congress and the Senate , which means they may know more about the confounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which seem to defy our understanding of physics .\nBut perhaps the biggest difference between 1977 and today , is that NASA is now fully aware that their predecessors were lied to by the CIA and the Air Force , when they were told there was no evidence to the reality unidentified flying objects .\nHere is hoping they do manage to learn from past mistakes .", "author": "red pill junkie", "url": "https://www.dailygrail.com/2022/06/that-time-when-nasa-was-asked-to-look-into-the-ufo-problem-and-said-nope/", "published": "Mon, 27

morning an explosive device was detonated by as-yet unknown individuals , completely shattering one of the four main pillars of the modern megalithic monument .\nAnd due to the significant amount of structural damage this caused , since then officials have now levelled the rest of the stones as well .\nBarely a month ago , I wrote about the enduring ability of the Georgia Guidestones to terrify conspiracy theorists , after a Republican Georgia gubernatorial candidate , Kandiss Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 which she claimed was \u2018 Satanic \u2019 \u2013 one of her leading campaign promises .\nThis position will no doubt put some focus on Taylor for possibly instigating the incident .\nHowever , the list of possible perpetrators would be a long one : while the Guidestones were certainly reviled by the burgeoning right-wing/Christian conspiracy crowd , revelations in recent years that the original mystery architect ( pseudonymously known as \u2018 R.C .\nChristian \u2019 ) was almost certainly one Herbert Kersten , a Republican supporter with an alleged history of racist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader David Duke and the eugenicist views of Nobel Prize-winning physicist William Shockley , could perhaps just as easily have made the monument a target of left-wing activists .\nPersonally , the destruction of the Georgia Guidestones saddens me .\nWhile the man behind them seems to have held some particularly odious views , for the most part the monument itself had a positive message of living in harmony with nature ( Kersten was , surprisingly , also an ardent conservationist\u2026he might perhaps be seen as an early \u2018 eco-fascist \u2019 ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , if humanity survives any future apocalyptic event .\nOn the flip-side , the Guidestones did contain some hints of his more awful views \u2013 the instruction \u2018 Guide reproduction wisely , improving fitness and diversity \u2019 sits rather uncomfortably once one is aware of his alleged eugenicist leanings .\nNo doubt too , the fact that the Georgia Guidestones incorporated archaeoastronomical principles and appears to have been inspired by Masonic myths ( see my article \u2018 Beyond the Apocalypse : The true message of the Georgia Guidestones \u2018 for a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation for me personally .\nIt was in many ways a modern work of art , inspired by ancient principles and myths .\nIt was also a work that took skilled craftmanship by those commissioned to create , from its construction through to the sandblasted engravings upon them \u2013 a source of much pride to a number of families in the area who had been involved in its creation , who will no doubt be devastated to see this act of vandalism destroying that legacy .\nFrom what I have seen on social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Guidestones \u2019 demolition by braindead conspiracy theorists and Fundamentalist Christians who wrongly believe the monument to be \u2018 Satanic \u2019 ( there \u2019 s some serious irony in the fact that it was apparently created by a racist Republican ) .\nOthers with more tempered views might still see the demolition of the stones as overall perhaps the best thing that could have happened , in light of the archaic racist views of the man behind them .\nEither way , the Georgia Guidestones are gone .", "author": "Greg", "url":

alterations in consciousness ( including mystical experiences , out-of-body experiences , and ego-dissolution ) ; ( 6 ) emotional responses ( including positive , rewarding , difficult , and challenging ) ; and ( 7 ) statements of profundity .\nThe most common somatic effects were somaesthesias ( 37.5 % of reports ) and an auditory ringing ( 15.4 % ) : If some of those descriptions sound similar to the NDE , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives ( dead or alive ) and visions of \u201c previous lives \u201d were described in 75 ( 2.0 % ) and 31 ( 0.8 % ) experiences , respectively .\n( For more on this topic , see \u201c Are Near-Death Experiences Caused by the Release of DMT in the Dying Brain ?\n\u201c ) More common visuals in the reports predominantly consisted of fractals , shapes , patterns ( 32.6 % of cases ) and vivid colours ( 25.2 % ) .\nArchitecture and structural features of the \u201c DMT world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimensions ( 25.2 % ) , rooms ( 15.4 % ) and a tunnel ( 10.3 % ) .\nReports of profound , mystical and ego-dissolution experiences were common , along with an acceptance/removal of the fear of death .\nIn terms of \u2018 locations \u2019 visited and architectural themes encountered , the most-reported environment was \u2018 alternate or higher dimensions \u2019 ( 25 % of all experiences ) , followed by simply \u2018 rooms \u2019 ( waiting room , medical examination room , a nursery etc ) at 15 % .\nMany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at small percentages , including astronomical environments ( 5 % ) and ancient places/cultural themes ( 1.9 % ) .\n( I was surprised to find that only 0.4 % of reports mentioned \u2018 impossible objects , tesseract , or 4-dimensional objects \u2019 , given how many times I have heard about this aspect . )\nOne of the most common experiences , however , was that of contact with an entity : encounters were found in 45.5 % of trip reports .\nEntity interactions were predominantly positive : around 35 % of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive \u2019 ( welcoming , healing etc ) , 32 % of interactions were of a \u2018 guide \u2019 or teaching type , while just 11 % were \u2018 negative or difficult \u2019 .\nInterestingly , 9 % of DMT entity encounters described a \u2018 medical-type interaction \u2019 , including examinations , implantations of a device , surgery and probing .\nThis will surely interest those who have considered a link between DMT entity encounters and the \u2018 alien abduction \u2019 phenomenon .\nEven more interesting perhaps were the descriptions of the entities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 machine elves \u2019 have become the defacto term for DMT entities , and beyond that there has been much talk about alien or insectoid beings ( perhaps on the basis of Dr Rick Strassman \u2019 s research , as presented in his book DMT : The Spirit Molecule ) , the study found that the most predominant term describing DMT entities was \u201c Feminine \u201d ( e.g .\n\u2018 Goddess \u2019 , \u2018 Mother Nature \u2019 , \u2018 feminine presence \u2019 ) , with almost one in every four accounts of entities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common descriptions were \u201c Deities/Divine Beings \u201d at 17 % , \u201c Aliens , Celestial Beings and Extraterrestrials \u201d at 16 % , and \u201c Animal or creature-based \u201d entities at 9 % .\nIndeed , \u2018 machine elves \u2019 as a specific description only featured in 2.9 % of the reports , \u2018 insectoid/praying mantis/arachnoid \u2019 in 2.3 % , and \u2018 Grey alien \u2019 in 1 % .\nHowever , other previously reported archetypes were more common : a \u2018 Jester , joker or clown \u2019 type entity was present in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and \u2018 Robot or machine entity \u2019 in 6.7 % .\nWhile these results seem to indicate that we should put \u2018 machine elves \u2019 to bed as a term describing DMT entities , it should be noted that the survey no doubt has some biases \u2013 not least that the vast majority of respondents were male , but also that analysing reports from a web forum comes with distinct limitations : Nevertheless , the multiple studies that have now been conducted on DMT trip reports that have analysed the encounter aspect all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide variety of \u2018 taxonomies \u2019 when it comes to DMT entities , and it may be well past time to move on from \u2018 machine elves \u2019 .\nFor those interested in more details , the paper offers a comprehensive breakdown of the elements reported in each of these thematic domains \u2013 far too many to expand on here , so I recommend you read the entire paper , or at least click through from

modern\u00a0history", "content": "Reports of Loch Ness monster sightings keep coming .\nThe latest report , accompanied by a video , is of a 20-30ft long creature occasionally breaking the water \u2019 s surface .\nAlthough the video clearly shows a moving v-shaped wake it does not reveal the underlying source .\nThe witnesses certainly saw something , but what ?\nThere have been over 85 theories of what the Loch Ness monster is , ranging from the prosaic ( wind slicks , reflections , plant debris and boat wakes ) to the zoological implausible ( anacondas , killer whales and the ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghost dinosaurs ) .\nThe people who came up with these theories were not necessarily that familiar with the loch .\nMany early suggestions by foreign zoologists implied they thought the loch was saltwater , which explains suggestions of sunfishes , whales , sharks and rays .\nSome theories have been reinvented independently , showing the ingenuity of each generation of Nessie inventors .\nFor example , the idea that the Loch Ness monster was originally a swimming elephant from a visiting circus , resurfaced three times , in 1934 , 1979 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed the idea was original .\nHowever , it was the notion of the Loch Ness monster as a prehistoric reptile that really captured the public \u2019 s imagination in the 1930s .\nNessie \u2019 s modern genesis really started in April 1933 .\nThe first eyewitness reports of a strange animal in the loch started in 1930 .\nYet it would only be in August of 1933 that witness George Spicer , who saw Nessie on land , first suggested that the creature was a reptile .\nUntil then informed commentators assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loch , it was some sort of vagrant freshwater animal like a seal that had made its way from the Moray Firth .\nSpicer just described it as a prehistoric reptile .\nHe claimed it had a long neck which allowed a journalist five days later to suggest it was a plesiosaur , a type of long-necked marine reptile from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods .\nOne ( but not the only one ) popular image of the Loch Ness monster was born .\nThe fact that the plesiosaur image of Nessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel Loxton and Donald Prothero \u2019 s ( 2013 ) theory Nessie originated with the highly popular 1933 King Kong film with its portrayal of a man-eating , long-necked , swamp-dwelling reptile .\nIt \u2019 s more likely that King Kong only influenced rather than created the modern Nessie .\nThe very first sightings of the Loch Ness monster were in 1930 and although there were more sightings in 1933 , they started in April before King Kong was screened in Scotland .\nMost reports of the Loch Ness monster don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nessie investigator ) Roy Mackal said in 1976 there were over 10,000 reports of the Loch Ness monster but gave no evidence to back this , and a table in his book Monsters of Loch Ness only contains 251 reports .\nI know of 1,452 distinct encounters .\nOnly about 20 % of the reports mention a neck of any length , so it is not the monster \u2019 s normal form .\nAlso less than 1 % of creatures in the reports are described as reptilian or scaly .\nSo I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported phenomena of the Loch Ness monster is founded on , it is not based on glimpses of a prehistoric reptile .\nIn reality , the Loch Ness monster has multiple identities .\nIt may not be a walrus , moose , camel or visiting extra-terrestrials , as some have suggested , but could be a myriad of anthropogenic ( boats , wakes , debris ) and natural ( animals , vegetation mats ) and physical phenomena ( wind effects , reflections ) .\nThe Loch Ness monster can vary in colour from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matt or glossy , furry or scaly .\nIt can have humps and manes , it can have horns and travel at great speed or not move at all .\nNo one identity captures the variety of Nessie \u2019 s reported features .\nThis suggests that Nessie is a function of human psychology rather than nature .\nAnd perhaps it is human psychology rather than nature that has sustained the idea of Nessie since the 1930s .\nSo what did the latest witnesses see ?\nThe reality is we have too little information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was happening in the video footage .\nThe problem with the vast majority of Nessie reports , is that they simply lack details you need to identify an animal .\nAnd any details that are reported may be misinterpretations .\nThe fact that the visible wake moves indicates it was an actual animal ( rather than snagged vegetation ) .\nBut was it a 20-30ft animal or some waterfowl or an otter under the water that created a large wake in smooth water ?\nWe will simply never know .\nArticle by Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mathematics and Statistics ,

and Gaia: When Earth System Science Gets Entangled with the Paranormal", "content": "When it comes to scientific ideas , most of them are forgotten almost as soon as they are published in a peer-reviewed journal ; but there are precious few of them which serendipitously arrive at just the exact moment and time , and those are the ones that manage to change the whole world .\nSuch is the case of the Gaia hypothesis , which was originally proposed by polymath and environmental pioneer James Lovelock .\nThe family of the UK scientist reported last week that he had just died peacefully on his 103rd birthday .\nThe first sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is measured by how much it is rejected at the time it is proposed .\nThe second sign is in how simple and obvious it feels to younger generations .\nIn 1972* Lovelock proposed such an idea when he conceived the whole planet Earth as if it were a giant superorganism , with its myriad of complex biological and non-biological systems acting in tandem as a single entity towards a of delicate balance .\nThe Gaia hypothesis arrived in the wake of the 60 \u2019 s counterculture movement , when youths in developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preoccupied with the world \u2019 s survival not only from the risk of nuclear war between the two superpowers , but also because of the increasing levels of industrial pollution and other dangerous imbalances caused by overpopulation .\nThe fact Lovelock decided to name his revolutionary idea after the Greek goddess of Earth perhaps made it both easier for it to capture the imagination of the hippie movement , as well as equally unappealing to older folks who scoffed at it as \u2018 New Age nonsense \u2019 at best** , or \u2018 Neopaganism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why nowadays these ideas are known under the more sober title of \u2018 Earth system science \u2019 .\nAnother inconvenient thing with ideas that change the paradigm , is they often take a life of their own and move in directions not intended by their original creators .\nWith the case of Gaia , New Agers regarded it as scientific \u2018 proof \u2019 that the Earth is not only alive , but also endowed with some sense of planetary consciousness ; Lovelock was deeply against such \u2018 mystical \u2019 interpretations and rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree-huggers \u2019 are not the only ones who embraced Gaia and ran with it .\nAmong researchers of Forteana , there have always been a few who suspect strange manifestations \u2013from lights in the sky to all sorts of things that go bump in the night\u2013 have something to do with the planet itself .\nEven the patron saint himself ( Charles Fort ) in his introduction to Lo !\n( 1931 ) predicted that : \u201c Someday there may be organic science or the interpretation of all phenomenal things in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the first researchers to propose the planet having a bigger impact in paranormal phenomena than we give it credit for was Ivan T. Sanderson with his twelve \u2018 vile vortices \u2019 which he proposed in 1968 \u2013the Bermuda triangle being the most famous one\u2013 where all sorts of unexplained disappearances and other manifestations allegedly take place .\nBy 1975 Jacques Vallee \u2013after departing from the \u2018 nuts-and-bolts- interpretation of UFOs with his seminal Passport to Magonia\u2013 wrote The Invisible College ; in it he proposed that UFOs operated as a \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exerting control on humanity \u2019 s mythologies and religious movements .\nTo Vallee , UFOs are not spaceships but archetypal objects in the Jungian sense of the word , that are both physical and psychic in ways we have failed to grasp since we \u2019 re too dazzled by their displays and obsessed with the promise of advanced technology .\nThat same year , paranormal raconteur John Keel went even further than Vallee did with The Eighth Tower , directly connecting Lovelock \u2019 s Gaia hypothesis with his own theories about what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy fields in the electromagnetic scale which are \u2018 sentient \u2019 , and from which \u2018 ultraterrestrial beings \u2019 emerge from time to time in order to play tricks with hapless humans .\nWhether we talk about a cultural thermostat or a superspectrum , the real question is whether we are dealing with a system that is either as automatic as the ones regulating tidal waves , or if it is actually controlled by some sort of intelligence .\nAnd if that is the case , has it our best interests when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keel , the ultraterrestrials are a pernicious influence in our planet ( he doesn \u2019 t shy away from equating UFOlogy with demonology ) which we must understand in order to free ourselves from their grip .\nWhile Vallee refrains from casting such moral judgments , he does agree with Keel that we need to focus on how UFOs manipulate our perceptions , lest anonymous groups with a secret agenda learn those secrets first \u2013something he warned us about in Messengers of Deception .\nBy the 1980s pioneer cattle mutilation researcher David Perkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and applied it to the new mystery which was making headways in the American southwest .\nAfter studying dozens of unexplained cow carcasses which could not easily be attributed to predation or other simpler causes \u2013and yes , even the idea of aliens coming to our world to steal a cow once in a while is too simplistic once you take a hard , unbiased look at the phenomenon\u2013 Perkins began to think about the mutilations as the work of \u201c unrecognized forces of Nature \u201d ( his own term ) manifesting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple glance devoid of any logic .\nAncient cultures throughout the world have always acknowledged these forces , and although they use different names for it , they can all be recognized under a simple umbrella term : the Trickster .\nAccording to psychologist Carl Jung , the trickster is an archetype that is , \u201c God , man and animal all at once .\nHe is both subhuman and superhuman , a bestial and divine being both superior and inferior to man.\n\u201d Enter psychologist George P. Hansen with his book The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nUsing an anthropological approach and applying it to paranormal phenomena Hansen saw in UFO sightings , ghostly apparitions , and cryptid phenomena , a trickster-y mechanism focused on attacking the rigidity of orthodoxy in order to inject novelty and reinvigorate society .\nIf Lovelock saw Gaia as a set of physical systems set to preserve the health of the superorganism , Hansen now proposed a sort of \u2018 paraphysical system \u2019 set to \u2018 disrupt \u2019 the stagnation of human culture .\nIn Greek mythology Hermes is not only considered the embodiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the will of the gods , a keeper of secrets\u2026 and a stealer of cattle .\nDoctors are aware of the importance of pain as alert signals that something is wrong in the organism .\nIf you suddenly experience an acute tooth ache , that is your body \u2019 s way of telling you have a cavity and it \u2019 s time to pay a visit to the dentist \u2019 s office ( ouch ) .\nWithin Lovelock \u2019 s Gaian perspective the bleaching of coral reefs is equally seen as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean .\nNow that we \u2019 re combining Gaian ideas with \u2018 Hermeneutics \u2019 , might there be also an ulterior motive behind the \u2018 aches \u2019 of paranormal manifestations , outside that of confusing us like Keel proposed in Eighth Tower ?\nTo David Perkins one motive behind unsolved cattle mutilations*** could be to alert us about a dangerous imbalance within our ecosystem brought upon by our increasing addiction to beef and dairy products .\nCattle ranches consume an excessive amount of water and land resources which are increasing the deforestation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention all the greenhouse methane expelled into the atmosphere by cow belching .\nIn an interview on the podcast Radio Misterioso , Perkins mentions the three \u201c C \u2019 s \u201d which James Lovelock thought were the biggest threat to Gaia : cows , cars , and chainsaws .\nPerhaps Gaia is using Hermes to tell us we should quit eating burgers ?\nAnother way Hermes might be tricking us for the sake of Gaia might be in the way of fomenting memes of extraterrestrial visitors that will eventually inspire us to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star systems**** , leaving ol \u2019 tired momma Gaia alone so she can recover and make room for the next explosion in biological evolution .\nPerkin \u2019 s colleague Christopher O \u2019 Brien \u2013author of numerous books , including Stalking the Trickster which Perkins wrote the foreword of ) thinks such an idea makes more sense than the Disclosure advocates \u2019 notion that ETs are just waiting for us to get our act together before they roll the red carpet and welcome us to the Galactic Federation with arms and tentacles open \u2013meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few more cows and abducting humans to pass the time .\nThere are many more things which could be said about the appeal of combining the Gaia hypothesis with Forteana or the way all could be tied together through human consciousness , and to be sure there are other authors who have come up with similar theories as Perkins and Hansen \u2013like Terence McKenna and Lyall Watson to name but a few more\u2013 but for now if there is anything I \u2019 d wish the reader of this essay to take from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as Lovelock elevated environmental science by seeing the interconnectedness between the living and the nonliving within our planet , so too should different disciplines within the paranormal also strive to seek the connecting elements within each other .\nJust as you can not save the coral reefs if you don \u2019 t pay attention to the atmosphere above the seas , you will never understand Bigfoot if you don \u2019 t pay attention to the elusive lights above the forests .\nKeel ultimately believed that Gaia was insane , but perhaps there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the absurdity is just Hermes \u2019 way to make us pay attention and look at our old problems with fresh new eyes .\nAnd\u2026 perhaps just as David Perkins suspects , the answers might turn out to be right under our noses .\n( * ) In his book Gaia : The Practical Science of Planetary Medicine ( Oxford 1991 ) , Lovelock writes that the first time he thought about the concept of Gaia was in 1965 : \u201c The personal revelation of Gaia came to me quite suddenly \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dictionary and other sources , the first time Lovelock publicly proposed the term Gaia was in 1972 .\nBy 1974 he and Lynn Margulis developed a view of Earth \u2019 s atmosphere as \u201c a component part of the biosphere rather than as a mere environment for life \u201d ( J. E. Lovelock and L. Margulis Tellus 26 , 2\u201310 ; 1974 ) .\nIn 1979 Lovelock published the book Gaia : A New Look at Life on Earth which fully cemented the idea in popular culture .\nAccording to David Perkins in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he first learned about Gaia \u201c and went to the races with it.\n\u201d ( ** ) Famous biologists Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Dawkins publicly criticized the Gaia hypothesis , claiming it was nothing but a catchy metaphor and didn \u2019 t conform to Darwinian principles .\n( *** ) According to Perkins , \u201c In the late 70s and early 80s I was still pursuing the nuclear connection [ to cattle mutilations ] \u2026 that somebody or something was drawing our attention to the various aspects of nukes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just one of many he works with simultaneously .\n( **** ) Lovelock himself was skeptical of the possibility of our species \u2019 adapting to an extraterrestrial ecosystem in our current condition .\nHis last book , Novacene , explored the possibility of humanity circumventing the calamity of environmental collapse by embracing the Singularity and a transhuman future .\nMaybe if we evolved into spindly biological robots ( ahem ) that would do the trick ?", "author": "red pill junkie", "url": "https://www.dailygrail.com/2022/08/the-marriage-of-hermes-and-gaia-when-earth-system-science-gets-entangled-with-the-paranormal/",

searches for evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence have been restricted almost solely so far to SETI , looking out across vast interstellar distances hoping to detect a signal from a faraway civilization .\nBut what if instead of looking out there , we looked\u2026here ?\nCould it be that we might find evidence of advanced alien technology on Earth itself ?\nWhile the question might bring to mind dubious stories of crashed flying saucers from the mid-20th century , it does appear that at least one highly-credentialed Harvard professor believes we could find an alien space probe here on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean \u2013 if we just go and look .\nAnd that \u2019 s exactly what he plans to do .\nAs might be expected , that \u2019 s not exactly what the scientific proposal says though \u2013 instead , it \u2019 s \u2018 officially \u2019 a search for a meteor that fell into the Pacific Ocean north of Papua New Guinea in 2014 .\nIn a paper posted to arXiv at the end of July 2022 ( \u201c An Ocean Expedition by the Galileo Project to Retrieve Fragments of the First Large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard astrophysicist Professor Avi Loeb , and co-authors Amir Siraj and Tim Gallaudet , lay out the case for an under-sea search to find pieces of the object .\nWhy this meteor ?\nFirstly , because of where it came from : it is the first to slam into Earth that has been identified as being of interstellar origin ( that is , it wasn \u2019 t in an orbit around our Sun , like most comets , asteroids and meteors that we come across ) .\nAfter Siraj and Loeb first identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our solar system in 2019 , earlier this year the United States Department of Defense ( US DoD ) confirmed their theory when it released a formal letter validating the interstellar origin of CNEOS 2014-01-08 at the 99.999 % confidence level .\nIn the paper , the researchers note that a space mission to retrieve material from an interstellar object \u2013 similar to the OSIRIS-REx2 mission that landed on the ( non-interstellar ) asteroid Bennu and will return material from it in late-2023 \u2013 have a cost of at least $ 1 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meteor on Earth would be far cheaper ( just over $ 1 million ) .\nTheir plan , they explain\u2026 The paper itself is filled with dry scientific analysis and technical calculations , but those are used to bring attention to , and explain , two anomalies related to the meteor : its speed , and the strength of the material it is composed of .\nBecause , compared to other space rocks , \u201c CNEOS 2014-01-08 is an outlier both in terms of its LSR [ Local Standard of Rest ] speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all stars ) and its composition ( tougher than all 272 other bolides in the CNEOS database ) .\n\u201d On that latter point , the researchers note that in the range of strength of various astronomical objects including comets , and carbonaceous , stony , and iron meteorites : This discussion of the anomalous properties of the meteor is then followed by somewhat of an odd non sequitur , given that at no point in the paper have they suggested anything along these lines : \u201c Of course , this result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meteor was artificially made by a technological civilization and not natural in origin.\n\u201d To understand why this statement was made , it \u2019 s firstly important to remember that Avi Loeb has become famous in recent years firstly for his controversial suggestion that the recently discovered interstellar body \u2018 Oumuamua could be an alien spaceship or probe , and secondly for his creation of the Galileo Project , an effort to look for evidence \u2013 both on Earth and in space \u2013 of \u2018 extraterrestrial technological civilizations \u2019 ( ETCs ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ is explicitly named in the title of this new arXiv paper .\nAnd so despite the paper \u2019 s calm assurance to scientists reading it that the Galileo Project team aren \u2019 t suggesting anything crazy like \u2018 alien tech \u2019 as an explanation for CNEOS 2014-01-08 , in other channels , Avi Loeb is\u2026less shy about his hopes for what it might turn out to be .\nIn a blog posted at Medium a couple of weeks before the arXiv paper was posted , simply titled \u201c Interstellar Artifacts \u201c , Loeb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 to find evidence of alien technology : As in the paper , Loeb discusses how \u2018 space archaeology \u2019 could be done out in space , or here on Earth : we could either prepare a rocket to chase another \u2018 Oumuamua-type object when it is detected ( which Loeb says is certainly a plan the Galileo Project is serious about : \u201c The Galileo Project aims to design a space mission that will rendezvous with the next \u2018 Oumuamua and get high quality data that would allow it to decipher its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look here on Earth at much less cost by mounting a search to recover debris from an interstellar object that hit Earth .\nThe money quote in the Medium article , however , is one that explictly notes that this is a search that has the potential of discovering that the \u2018 meteor \u2019 was actually an alien space probe : \u201c The Galileo Project plans an expedition to retrieve the fragments of this meteor from the ocean floor in an attempt to determine the composition and structure of this unusual object and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in origin.\n\u201d [ my emphasis ] Elsewhere in his blog post , Loeb points out that the number of alien space probes in our galaxy \u201c could be extremely large if they are self-replicating , a concept enabled by 3D printing and AI technologies \u201d .\nAnd , perhaps in reference to the estimated half-metre size of CNEOS 2014-01-08 , he notes that \u201c NASA launched more small spacecraft than large ones\u2026 In addition , the launch of faster objects increases the specific energy requirements and therefore may be restricted to smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Loeb \u2019 s views on CNEOS 2014-01-08 , as presented in his blog post , make the concluding remarks in the arXiv paper hit a little different .\n\u201c The best way to decipher anomalies is to gather additional data \u201d , the researchers note .\n\u201c Altogether , anomalous properties of interstellar objects like CNEOS-2014-01-08 and \u2018 Oumuamua , hold the potential for revising conventional wisdom on our cosmic neighborhood.\n\u201d Or even our cosmic neighbors\u2026", "author": "Greg", "url":

representations of dreams and nightmares have changed over\u00a0time", "content": "As Netflix \u2019 s new series , The Sandman , notes , we spend a third of our lives in sleep and dream .\nIn popular culture , The Sandman is a folkloric being who helps us drift off to the land of nod where he controls whether we have nightmares or dreams .\nHe is also the centre of Neil Gaiman \u2019 s popular comic book series ( 1989-96 ) , which the new series is based on .\nThe embodiment of dream as a mythological or literary character has variously been presented as benevolent or sinister , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the nature and meaning of dreams and nightmares .\nThese conflicting personifications of dream ( and nightmare ) reflect our ambiguous cultural ideas of dreaming .\nDreaming has been associated with supernatural messages , divinatory arts and psychotherapeutic insights .\nWhile seemingly at odds with modernity \u2019 s emphasis on rationalism , dreams and works of dreamlike fantasy such as The Sandman continue to provide a much-needed sense of enchantment in our modern age .\nPersonifications of dream go back far in history .\nAs befits an entity who rules the shifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfixed , referred to as Morpheus , Onieros , Dream King , and the Sandman , among others .\nAncient Greek and Roman civilisations understood dreams to be both the messengers and messages .\nIn Homer \u2019 s The Iliad , Zeus sends an onieros , a personified dream , to the Greek camp at Troy to encourage Agamemnon to fight .\nIn Hesiod \u2019 s The Theogony the oneiroi are the dream children of Nyx or Night .\nIn Roman mythology , Morpheus served Somnus , the god of sleep .\nAlthough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to classical poets .\nIn Ovid \u2019 s Metamorphosis he is one of Somnus \u2019 s thousand children , a shapeshifting dream and \u201c master mimic \u201d who moved \u201c on noiseless wings \u201d .\nMorpheus reveals the psychological sophistication of classical mythology , a rich body of stories that not only accounted for the operation of the natural world but also the interior workings of the human mind .\nBy the 19th and 20th centuries , Morpheus , or The Sandman , had become a more benevolent character .\nNo longer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently evoked as someone who could reunite lost lovers in dreams .\nSuch sentiments are found in Alexander Pushkin \u2019 s poem , Morpheus , and in Roy Orbison \u2019 s song In Dreams , where the Sandman becomes \u201c a candy-coloured clown \u201d who sprinkles stardust .\nThe Chordettes 1954 hit Mr Sandman asked him to send them a dream lover before they got too old .\nYet the Sandman has also taken on menacing aspects .\nIn E.T.A .\nHoffman \u2019 s disturbing story , The Sandman ( 1816 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand in the eyes of children who won \u2019 t go to sleep , causing them to bleed .\nHe then puts them in a bag and takes them to his owl-beaked children who peck out their eyes as food .\nThis more malevolent embodiment of nightmare was updated in the character of Freddy Krueger , star of the Nightmare on Elm Street horror film franchise .\nGaiman \u2019 s Sandman combines both caring and threatening aspects .\nA figure committed to protecting dreamers and The Dreaming , the place where we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and punishes dream creations who challenge his benignly authoritarian rule .\nThese personifications of dream and nightmare encourage the unsettling sense that such things come from outside us .\nMany ancient civilisations credited oneiromancy , the interpretation of dreams in order to foretell the future as a form of supernatural power .\nSuch ideas are put to dramatic use in Shakespeare \u2019 s Julius Caesar .\nOneiromancy persisted and was updated for an increasingly urban and literate population in the 19th- and 20th-century development of dream books .\nThese popular publications , intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an A-Z of dream images that helped dreamers interpret their dreams and foretell their future .\nThe uninvited , uncontrollable and nonsensical nature of dreams disturbed our modern championing of rationality and reason , causing them to be dismissed as mere unconscious mental play .\nWhen the 19th- and early 20th-century pioneers of psychotherapy engaged with dreams , they attempted to rationalise the meaning and function of their seemingly random and illogical content .\nSigmund Freud \u2019 s The Interpretation of Dreams ( 1899 ) argued dreams provided insight into psychological repression and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual nature .\nApplying rationalised interpretations , dreams were not mental junk but telling insights into the forbidden wishes of individual minds .\nNo longer external influences delivered by divine messengers , dreams were firmly grounded within us .\nInterestingly , the sinister nature of Hoffman \u2019 s Sandman story attracted Freud \u2019 s attention in his 1919 essay , The Uncanny .\nYet it is Freud \u2019 s former friend and rival , Carl Jung , to whom Gaiman \u2019 s idea of The Dreaming owes a greater debt .\nMorpheus \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fictional expression of Jung \u2019 s notion of the collective unconscious , a place of archetypal figures , symbols , and images that repeatedly appear in all our dreams .\nLike all good works of fantasy , The Sandman questions the dominant story western society has repeatedly told itself for over three centuries : that we have become rational , disenchanted , free of the fantastical ideas of the past .\nAs the glut of fantasy serials on Netflix suggests , such a world requires the compensatory enchantment of fantasy , fiction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tori Amos \u2019 s Tear in Your Hand , we will be hanging out with the Dream King for the foreseeable future .\nThis

in popular culture , but eventually festered on and mutated into a myriad of right-wing anti-government mythologies ; like Project Blue Beam , which would make use of classified military technology to simulate a bogus alien invasion that would facilitate the establishment of the New World Order , or the construction of FEMA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed \u201c any minute now \u201d ) where citizens would be sent in if they resisted the NWO \u2018 globalists \u2019 .\nThe old conspiracy theories of the 1990s are the roots that permitted Alex Jones and the modern Q-Anon to blossom in the 2020s .\nBut Norio is no tinfoil-hat conspiracy loon .\nHe prefers the term \u201c conspiratologist \u201d ( a neologism coined by Gary Schultz ) in order to distance himself from the crowd who type in all caps and keep maps tangled with colored threads in their basement office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experiences he had while he was actively investigated the claims of Bob Lazar , could have made anyone spiral down into madness \u2013like being chased down by an unmarked black helicopter while he was escorting a Japanese TV crew to film alleged UFOs near Area 51 .\nSo it is a credit to Norio that for whatever reason , either his cultural origins or his other life interests ( he \u2019 s an accomplished musician and his love for his adopted home of Albuquerque , New Mexico , is shown in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully managed to peer into the Abyss and turn away just in time , before the Abyss consumed him entirely .\nNowadays Norio is not a full-fledge skeptic because he still believes there IS something going on which causes people ( like his own parents ) to experience UFO events occasionally .\nBut the things he observed around people like Bob Lazar \u2013things you will NEVER hear Jeremy Corbell mention in an interview\u2013 convinced him that , aside from the genuine mystery , there is also an ongoing effort to exploit UFOs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems .\nAnd the spread of misinformation becomes fertile soil for opportunists who will always be there seeking to profit from the confusion .\nPerhaps the only way to inoculate oneself from the modern heirs to 1990s Conspiranoia ( we all know who they are ) is to pay attention to what happened before they arrived to the scene , in order to better understand how anti-government mentality and disparaged mythologies crosspollinate with the UFO lore until one can \u2019 t tell shit from shinola , as Terence McKenna used to say .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and singing Country music wouldn \u2019 t hurt either , as I \u2019 m sure Norio would agree .\nMany thanks to filmmaker Justin Jay Jones .", "author": "red pill junkie", "url":

"date": "2022-09-02", "source": "dailygrail", "title": "From global consciousness to global apocalypse: could Putin\u2019s advisor Anton Vaino use a psi experiment to justify war?", "content": "Six years ago , Russian president Vladimir Putin appointed a new chief of staff , Anton Vaino .\nBefore his promotion to the upper echelons of the Kremlin , Vaino had served as a diplomat , as well as writing a number of journal articles on economics and society ( he is said to have a masters in economics ) .\nOne of those articles , \u2018 The capitalisation of the future \u2019 , proposed a number of new ways of organising and understanding society .\nKey to these changes was a new device he called a \u2018 nooscope \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global consciousness and \u201c detect and register changes in the biosphere and in human activity \u201c .\nIf that sounds familiar , you might have previously heard about the Global Consciousness Project ( GCP ) , a parapsychology experiment which attempts to detect \u201c global consciousness \u201d by looking for its influence on physical systems .\nThe experiment is conducted by monitoring a worldwide network of random number generators ( RNGs ) , looking for \u201c meaningful departures from expectation \u201d in the data that are coincident in time with major global events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of major figures etc ) .\nDr Roger D. Nelson , who developed the idea of the GCP during his time at Princeton University , said of the experiment : The GCP researchers believe that the evidence they have collected \u201c suggests an emerging noosphere or the unifying field of consciousness described by sages in all cultures \u201d .\nThe \u2018 noosphere \u2018 mentioned by the GCP \u2013 an obvious inspiration also for Vaino \u2019 s \u2018 nooscope \u2019 \u2013 is an idea that was first popularized in the early 20th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Russian geobiochemist Vladimir Vernadsky .\nAt its most simplest , it can perhaps be described as a continuation of terms like geosphere and biosphere , but adding worldwide collective consciousness as the next layer beyond geological and biological systems ( noosphere originating from the Greek word noos , meaning \u2018 the mind \u2019 ) .\nIt is seen as the next step in planetary evolution : from geology , to the emergence of biology , to the development of an overall interlinked global consciousness .\nFrom some this is somewhat spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is more material and technical ( e.g .\nthe internet ) \u2013 and sometimes it \u2019 s seen as a mix of both .\nReturning to Vaino , this week investigative journalist Dave Troy posted a Twitter thread with some disturbing suggestions regarding Vaino \u2019 s philosophy and his influence on Putin : Vladimir Putin believes the Westphalian nation-state model is obsolete , and is ushering in his radical idea of a replacement , based on the idea of the \u201c Noosphere \u201d first popularized by 20th c. Russian \u201c cosmist \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westphalian nation-state model is obsolete , and is ushering in his radical idea of a replacement , based on the idea of the \u201c Noosphere \u201d first popularized by 20th c. Russian \u201c cosmist \u201d Vladimir Vernadsky .\nVernadsky , a scientist much admired in both Russia and Ukraine , theorized that Earth must undergo three distinct phases .\nGeosphere ( bare rock ) , Biosphere ( hosting life ) , and Noosphere ( hosting consciousness ) .\nVernadsky said \u201c to expect ruthless struggles , shocks and tremors , and even an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Biosphere ( Bio=life ) to Noosphere ( Noos=mind ) .\nPutin seems to have latched onto this as a mystic prophecy .\nTroy says Putin has married Vernadsky \u2019 s noosphere idea \u2013 with its intrinsic apocalyptic transition period built in \u2013 with the occult-political theories of Alexander Dugin to produce a \u201c Eurasianist ethnocentric noocracy \u201d , as a way to push back against what he sees as the failures of democracy and the hegemony of the West .\nWhat Troy finds concerning is that in recent weeks , multiple Kremlin-fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d \u2026 If you \u2019 re thinking that someone like Putin wouldn \u2019 t buy into all this internet-consciousness apocalyptic mumbo-jumbo , it pays to remember that he is a Boomer \u2013 see the whole QAnon movement for the gullibility factor on weird prophetic ideas with that group \u2013 and he already has dipped his toes into Alexander Dugin \u2019 s occult-fascist ideas .\nHowever , unless Troy is sitting on more details , it still seems a long bow to draw .\nRussia is currently not doing particularly well , relatively speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it \u2019 s not surprising that its propaganda channels might be foreshadowing an apocalyptic event ( nuclear strike , nuclear plant accident etc ) as part of a possible future strategic move .\nNo \u2018 noosphere \u2019 needed to explain that , really .\nFurthermore , Troy works a little too hard to tie in New Age ideas as being key to the danger .\nSome of the links between people he puts forward as being important to the development of this situation seem tenuous in reality \u2013 and are , ironically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followers ( mentioned in the thread as useful idiots for disinfo propaganda ) tend to create important connections from rather tangential links in order to prove their own beliefs to themselves .\nHowever , it remains a fact that Anton Vaino \u2013 a man with some fringe ideas that tie in global consciousness and world domination \u2013 has the direct ear of the

of an Afterlife: The Next Phase", "content": "At the start of 2021 , wealthy Las Vegas businessman Robert Bigelow announced a million-dollar essay competition , asking for summaries of the best scientific evidence for the survival of consciousness beyond death .\nFor the last few decades Bigelow has been an active funder of research into \u2018 fringe science \u2019 topics running the gamut from UFOs to the paranormal , and with this essay competition ( along with the creation of the Bigelow Institute for Consciousness Studies , or BICS ) he stated he was trying to bring some focus ( and financial resources ) to a fundamentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by mainstream science .\n\u201c We \u2019 re trying to do something we think and hope is good for everybody \u2019 s work , \u201d he told journalist George Knapp .\n\u201c So many people have spent their lives in this field and haven \u2019 t received much recognition\u2026it \u2019 s not a field that attracts masses of people as researchers .\nSo we \u2019 re trying to stir the pot and create some excitement.\n\u201d Now , the second phase of Bigelow \u2019 s support for the search for evidence of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun , with the announcement of the BICS Challenge Grants Program for 2023 by Robert Bigelow and Colm Kelleher at this year \u2019 s International Association for Near-Death Studies ( IANDS ) conference , with another $ 1million on offer : While the initial competition was a vehicle for researchers and writers to summarise the best evidence for an afterlife so far , the BICS Challenge Grant Program is more about providing support for scientists and researchers to design experiments and uncover new , convincing evidence .\nThe $ 1million in grants is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following way , to allow multiple groups to investigate different areas : \u2022 12 grants of up to $ 50,000 ( $ 600,000 ) \u2022 4 grants of up to $ 100,000 ( $ 400,000 ) The grants will only be given to research that is on \u2018 the survival of human consciousness beyond permanent bodily death \u2019 , and exclusively focused on \u201c contact or communication with the \u2018 Other Side \u2019 .\n\u201d BICS also prefers that the research should \u201c preferably break new ground.\n\u201d Preliminary proposals/letters of intent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2023 , with applicants then being picked from those to submit official proposals by April 1st .\nGrantees will be announced on 1st of August 2023 , with final reports being due at the start of May 2024 .\nThe program is open to researchers across the globe .\n\u201c If this is successful , \u201d Bigelow noted at the program \u2019 s announcement , \u201c then we go on to Phase 3 \u201d .\nHe then intimated that funding at that level might possibly be closer to around $ 5million per year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the essay competition showing there are many different areas of research that have offered evidence for survival of consciousness , this next phase is targeting \u2018 contact \u2019 or \u2018 communication \u2019 with deceased personalities .\nThat is , things like mediumship , channeling , remote viewing , automatic writing , hypnotic regression and lucid dreaming \u2013 rather than some of the very interesting research into things like veridical near-death experiences where people access information about their surroundings that they should not have been able to access ( e.g .\nseeing things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconscious and near-death ) .\nListening to the initial presentation , and the questions afterward , I was also left a little confused by Bigelow \u2019 s talk of wanting \u2018 wisdom \u2019 and \u2018 guidance \u2019 as part of the evidence .\nFor me , anomalous perception of verifiable information from apparently deceased individuals should be key to any type of proof in these experiments , but the intimation seemed to be of wanting things that would be more ambiguous or nebulous ( what one person perceives as \u2018 wisdom \u2019 might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platitude ) .\nSo it would be good to have more clarity on this element .\nAnother notable part of the presentation was Bigelow \u2019 s response to a question about whether this sort of research requires safeguards .\nWhen I heard the question , I assumed it was about ethical safeguards , but Bigelow seemed to answer in terms of weird/scary/dangerous paranormal phenomena happening to people involved in the research ( the so-called \u2018 hitchhiker effect \u2019 ) .\nHe noted that since the formation of BICS in March 2020\u2026 He then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to have occurred as a result of his involvement with Skinwalker Ranch , saying \u201c it also happens in a sister area or another subject , the same kind of thing\u2026 so you don \u2019 t know exactly how to predict what \u2019 s going to be happening , sometimes it \u2019 s adverse in a very small minority of instances \u201d .\nA later question returned to the topic somewhat , and Bigelow then elaborated in far more depth on the \u2018 hitchhiker effect \u2019 , saying it was a topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on by researchers \u201d into evidence for the afterlife , but\u2026 \u2026if any of you have done a lot of research then you understand there there is a dark side to some of it .\nOkay i see a head or two nodding\u2026we know that this has to be taken very seriously .\nThere are philosophies and policies , procedures in your own heart and your own mind that you have to adopt and embrace \u2013 love is the most powerful component of all as to the objectivity of the entire end result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side to other features .\n\u2018 Earthbound spirits \u2019 , according to the research , outnumber vastly all the other levels combined , and they \u2019 re an amalgam of different kinds of human kinds of of attitudes , just as bad as anybody walking on the face of the Earth that \u2019 s already incarnated .\nYou don \u2019 t want to go down those paths , there \u2019 s ways of avoiding them and ways of not giving them power \u2013 but you have to respect them you have to respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side is to try to help them to try to elevate them , and it \u2019 s a matter of function of whether you want to be helped or not as to whether you \u2019 re going to make any progress on the other side .\nThat \u2019 s what the literature and the research say .\nWe \u2019 ve had to deal with these kinds of things , so we \u2019 re not novices entirely in this field , even though we \u2019 ve been in a relatively short time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing [ your experience ] because this is a very important thing .\nIt \u2019 s real , it \u2019 s not to be laughed at or joked about , and if you do it \u2019 s because you haven \u2019 t done any research or you haven \u2019 t done enough , you haven \u2019 t talked to enough people , you haven \u2019 t read enough or you haven \u2019 t had anything happen to you or somebody that you know .\n\u2026All of our studies and all of our research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened happened with some scary things that happened to people that we were connected with , government people\u2026but in our particular experience people didn \u2019 t get physically hurt fortunately .\nOne can certainly see Bigelow \u2019 s critics and skeptics latching on to such comments to paint him as being irrational and unscientific \u2013 but it does also suggest that his own experiences in the paranormal over the last couple of decades have resulted in a number of strange experiences that have had a significant effect on him .\nIn any case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the researchers who submit proposals for this second phase \u2013 hopefully we will see some well-constructed experiments that can stand up to scrutiny if they produce positive evidence .", "author": "Greg", "url": "https://www.dailygrail.com/2022/09/robert-bigelows-search-for-evidence-of-an-afterlife-the-next-phase/", "published": "Sat, 10 Sep 2022 07:04:48 +0000",

Mexico Suffers Major Tremor on Anniversary of *Two* Previous Deadly Earthquakes", "content": "The great painter Salvador Dal\u00ed once said , \u201c There is no way I \u2019 m going back to Mexico .\nI can \u2019 t stand to be in a country that is more surrealist than my paintings.\n\u201d And the \u2018 magical realism \u2019 of my country made itself evident once again today , September 19th ; a date that forever looms in the minds of many of us because it has become a constant reminder of the frailty of our lives when confronted with the powerful \u2013and often inexplicable\u2013 forces of Nature .\nMexico sits atop powerful tectonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of their devastating movements since time immemorial .\nWith the advent of modern science men began to better understand the mechanics behind such natural phenomena , and one of the axioms of modern Seismology is that earthquakes are unpredictable , and do not follow regular patterns .\nAnd yet this seems to contradict the regularity of tremors during the month of September in the Mexican territory in recent years , which sometimes are followed by the appearance of luminous phenomena which some people interpret as \u2018 Earth lights \u2019 ( read two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here ) .\nIf someone were to ask me \u201c when have you felt the more scared in your life \u201d I could immediately offer an answer : September 19 , 1985 .\nI was eleven years old and getting ready for school inside the bathroom I shared with my two older sisters , when the younger one of my siblings ( who was on the other side of the bathroom behind a pair of French doors ) suddenly said \u201c est\u00e1 temblando !\n\u201d ( \u201c it is trembling \u201d ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pulling my leg but after a few seconds I sensed it too .\nAnd as if to dissipate any question in my mind the tremors kept coming in wave after wave .\nGetting stronger .\nAnd stronger .\nAnd stronger .\nI can \u2019 t tell how long the tremors lasted .\nThey seemed to go on forever , in that moment of visceral terror in which your whole world is literally shaking and nothing feels safe anymore .\nLong enough at least for me to rush down the stairs and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only source of comfort and reassurance I could think of .\n\u201c Mommy mommy it is trembling !\n\u201d I cried when I found her , and I could see in her eyes she was just as scared as I was and couldn \u2019 t hide it \u2013not the kind of thing a child ever wants to see in the face of their parents .\nMy mom didn \u2019 t utter a word ; she just held me in her arms , and I remember we just stood there hugging each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHad our home been located near the areas close to ground zero , perhaps that is where some of the makeshift civilian rescue parties would have found our bodies , just as they did with the thousands of victims ( how many God only knows , because the government will never tell us ) who perished that day .\nNow that my mom is gone , I keep thinking about that a lot .\nYou would think a grown man would be able to handle things better , but on September 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 1985 fatality ) I was working on some commission when around noon I felt a certain dizziness , and before I could wonder if it was a true tremor or I just needed a break , all the windows began to rattle in the most horrific way .\nI skedaddled into the garden dumbfounded ( not the smartest move , I know ) as I saw all the neighboring houses drunkenly swaying all around me .\nThe material damages caused by the 2017 earthquake were considerable , and the casualties were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thousands of 1985 .\nThe aftermath was also not as apocalyptic-looking as in that decades-past event \u2013or maybe I was no longer looking at them through the eyes of such an impressionable young kid\u2013 but it was nonetheless a stark reminder of how sturdy-looking structures can collapse like a bundle of toothpicks in the blink of an eye .\nBack then a few seismologists appeared on TV to remind the public that , despite the appearances , earthquakes remain random chaotic events governed by laws which follow no regular pattern .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincidence \u2019 and nothing else .\nAuthorities used the event to further press into the populace a culture of preparedness , so every year on the same date , at 12:19 pm the seismological sirens are activated , and a general drill is performed .\nMany offices and businesses lucky enough to be around a functioning siren do perform the drill but may others do not .\nSo what are the odds , I ask you , that in 2022 \u2014exactly 5 years after the 2017 quake , and 37 years after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced in several regions of Mexico almost an hour after the annual drill was performed ?\n?\nIn any other place in the world , the odds are infinitesimal* , but in a surrealist country like Mexico\u2026 pretty darn good !\nThis new \u201c anniversary quake \u201d caught me ( once more ) working in front of my laptop , and although it didn \u2019 t felt as strongly as the ones in 2017 or 1985 , by now I did the right thing of quickly exiting the house to join all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all showing the same mixture of nervous bemusement and incredulity in our faces as we were thinking the same thing : \u201c No way , AGAIN ?\n!\nWTF\u2026 \u201d And again professional seismologists are shown on TV nervously laughing while saying \u201c oh well , he he\u2026 one of those things !\n\u201d Because what the hell else are they going to say .\nMeanwhile civilians are alleviating their anxiety by producing and sharing funny memes ( \u201c In Mexico Seismology is not a branch of science , but of Astrology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cerveza says Mexico , \u201d etc . )\nLook , nobody is saying we should go back to the age of superstition and soothsaying through bone throwing and looking for omens in birds in flight \u2013though I \u2019 m sure many of my witchy friends would have a thing or two to say on the matter .\nAll I \u2019 m saying is that , if 48 years of living in a magical realm as Mexico have taught me anything , is that when it comes to the accuracy of scientific laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ randomness of seismic activity ) Mother Gaia will always have the final word .\nIn the meantime , it \u2019 s time to replenish the supplies of the emergency kit held in every Mexican household : namely Tequila and some pieces of warm \u2018 bolillo \u2019 bread \u201c para el susto \u201d \u2013a folk remedy used to cure anxiety that should also not work according to

the five UK terrestrial television channels showed uninterrupted coverage of the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II .\nFrom 8 am until 5 pm BBC 1 , BBC 2 , ITV , and Channel 4 \u2019 s programming was wholly dedicated to the procession , services , and eventual laying to rest of the coffin at Saint George \u2019 s chapel , Windsor .\nAt approximately 2:55 pm , ITV \u2019 s live coverage of the funeral was interrupted by a whispered , female voice which appeared to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that she \u2019 s\u2013 \u201c .\nThe final word of the interruption was interpreted by some as \u201c trapped \u201c , by others as \u201c travelling \u201c .\nTwitter user @ goulcher posted a clip of the strange TV interruption on the micro-blogging site at 4:19 pm .\nThere has already been plenty of speculation on Twitter and elsewhere as to the possible meanings and origins of the eerie interruption .\nThe ghost of Princess Diana has been put forth as a possible culprit by some , although this seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt is , however , worth noting that Diana being alive and soon to return to the public sphere has very recently become a part of QAnon conspiracy theory .\nMessages like the one below were shared on Telegram , Reddit , Facebook , and elsewhere , as the rolling coverage of Royal Funeral went out live .\nOthers have suspected that the ghostly voice might have been the work of a broadcast intrusion prankster , along the lines of previous broadcast intrusions that have featured everyone from Max Headroom to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting level \u2013 and wholly at the other end of the explanation spectrum from \u2018 Diana \u2019 s ghost \u2019 \u2013 plenty of people have put forth the theory that the interruption was nothing more than someone in the TV studio whose whispered words were accidentally picked up on a microphone during the live broadcast .\nThe fact that the male presenter who can be heard on the clip seems to be aware of his words and those of the whispering woman overlapping does seem to bear this theory out .\nFurthermore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the clip mentioning his fellow presenter Emily Morgan by name .\nThis would suggest that Emily Morgan is about to go on air , adding her own commentary to the proceedings .\nAlthough I have been unable to find the original broadcast online \u2013 with or without the interruption \u2013 on ITV \u2019 s own streaming service or YouTube channel , I did find the following quote on their website : ITV News \u2019 Correspondent Emily Morgan , who was on the A4 as the hearse went by , said : \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A4 a hush descended .\n\u201c As it came past me there was a spontaneous eruption of clapping , people cheering .\nI don \u2019 t think anyone expected that to happen , it was a real outpouring of love and grief .\n\u201c There are still people standing here now .\nI think they \u2019 re finding it difficult to walk away , to accept that this moment , for them at least , is over.\n\u201d Given the wording of the interruption ( \u201c That death is irreversible , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] \u201d ) it does seem possible , likely even , the words quoted on the ITV page are some kind of second draft of whatever was accidentally broadcast .\nAnother candidate for the explanation of an in-studio \u2018 hot mic \u2019 is grief expert Julia Samuel , who some have noted was also on the broadcast talking about how to explain death to children , including that they know that the deceased loved one will not be returning ( ie .\nthat death is irreversible ) .\nWhatever the ( likely mundane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , the fact that they were whispered , and the timing of their breaking through the live audio in such a eerie manner will still surely have left many people spooked , and will likely lead to some ongoing modern folklore about the ghostly voice that interrupted the Queen \u2019 s funeral broadcast .", "author": "John Reppion",

memorabilia , if that \u2019 s how you roll ) , a new Kickstarter project will surely be of interest : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are raising money to reproduce the \u2018 lost \u2019 tarot deck of the legendary occultist and artist Austin Osman Spare !\nThe back story : almost a decade ago , curator and artist Jonathan Allen discovered a 79-card , hand-painted tarot deck created circa 1906 by the famed 20th century artist and mystic , which had lain virtually unnoticed in the collections of The Magic Circle Museum in London .\nIn 2016 , our good friends at Strange Attractor Press published Lost Envoy \u2013 the Tarot Deck of Austin Osman Spare , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought after collectible ) that featured over 200 full colour images reproducing the lost deck in its entirety alongside written contributions from a host of writers and occultists .\nAnd now , by popular demand , Strange Attractor Press are aiming to produce a physical edition of the deck itself , along with a paperback edition of Lost Envoy \u2013 but they need funding to do so , hence this Kickstarter campaign .\nWe \u2019 ll be working with one of the world \u2019 s most experienced printers of playing cards to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the overlapping divinatory motifs found on many of the cards \u2013 a distinctive and unique feature of the original deck \u2013 are reproduced as accurately as possible .\nThe deck \u2019 s missing Strength card , of which only a black and white photograph survives , will be recreated in full colour and included in the facsimile deck .\nWe \u2019 ll be offering bonus materials , including an enamel badge of one of the unique marginal motifs , a set of postcards and a cloth bag , and a few extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will only be available to Kickstarter backers .\nOnce published , the deck will be exclusively available directly from Strange Attractor Press and no other online sellers .\nInterested in getting a deck for yourself ( and perhaps some extra kit and a paperback copy of Lost Envoy ?\nHead on over to the Austin Osman Spare Tarot Deck & Book Kickstarter campaign and choose your reward !", "author": "Greg", "url":

word \u2018 megaliths \u2019 is intimately associated with the stone circles of the British Isles \u2013 not least due to the overwhelming space that Stonehenge takes up in the layman \u2019 s mind when people think about ancient stone monuments .\nThose with a bit more knowledge might also think of France , specifically the amazing stone rows of Carnac , or they may have heard the recent news about a massive megalithic complex being discovered in Spain .\nBut the surprising truth is that cultures right around the world , from Africa to the Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldest written record of the word \u201c megalithic \u201d dates from 1849 , used by the British antiquarian Algernon Herbert in his work Cyclops Christianus ; Or , An Argument to Disprove the Supposed Antiquity of the Stonehenge and Other Megalithic Erections in England and Britanny .\nMegalith simply means big stone , and megalithic monuments are , therefore , monuments constructed of big stones .\nSo far as descriptive names go , it does the job , but it is not wonderfully illuminating nor specific , though a key component of megalithic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed without the use of mortar .\nThe majority of megaliths were set in place somewhere between 4,000 BCE ( the end of the New Stone Age or Neolithic period ) and 500 CE ( the end of what we call Ancient History ) , though there are plenty of exceptions .\nNevertheless , most of us understand that , when talking about megaliths , we \u2019 re typically dealing with \u201c prehistoric \u201d ( another not-quite-specific-enough 19th-century antiquarian word ) monuments .\nMegaliths have been divided into five subcategories : \u2022 Tumuli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained chambers ) \u2022 Circles ( either surrounding Tumuli and Dolmen , or standing alone ) \u2022 Menhir ( distinct single standing stones , though often forming part of a larger group ) .\nThe exact meaning and purpose of many of these megalithic monuments remain mysterious ; no less intriguing today than they were to our antiquarian forebears .\nBelow are just a few of the most fascinating , and varied , examples of the known megalithic monuments around the world today .\nThe Federal Republic of Ethiopia is home to many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is at Sakaro Sodo , in the Gedeo Zone , in the south of the country .\nSome of these upright , phallic stones ( carved with stylised veins and foreskins , as well as faces and other designs in some cases ) stand as high as 20 feet ( 6 metres ) above ground .\nFirst studied by French researchers in the 1990s , the menhir were originally believed to have been erected circa 1100 CE .\nFurther research conducted by Dr. Ashenafi Zena in 2021 , however , places their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100CE .\nDr. Ashenafi Zena , who was born in Ethiopia and works with the State Historical Society of North Dakota and Hawassa University , also found that obsidian artefacts from the site originated some 186 miles ( 300 km ) away in northern Kenya .\nThis would seem to indicate that the people who erected the monuments at Sakaro Sodo obtained this obsidian through trade .\nThese impressive monuments appear to coincide with the arrival of domesticated animals in the region , and with the beginnings of more complex social and economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erected in acknowledgement of beliefs and practices already much older than the emerging society which created them .\nThe Senegambian Stone Circles can be located in West Africa , across Gambia and Senegal .\nMore than 1000 circles and tumuli are spread across an area 217 miles ( 350km ) long and 62 miles ( 100 km ) wide ; the largest concentration of stone circles found anywhere in the world .\nClose to 30,000 rust-red laterite stones make up the monuments , and this rock is believed to have been quarried using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wassu site in Gambia are believed to be around 1,000 years old , but the date of the stone circles themselves has not yet been properly ascertained .\nEstimates of the date of the monuments \u2019 construction range widely from 300 BCE to 1700 CE , though later material may , in fact , be proof of ongoing use and repair rather than of the original construction .\nAccording to UNESCO : \u201c Together the stone circles of laterite pillars and their associated burial mounds present a vast sacred landscape created over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prosperous , highly organized and lasting society.\n\u201d The Lothagam North Pillar Site is located on the west side of Lake Turkana in Kenya .\nThere , a burial mound which holds the remains of hundreds of individuals is surrounded by a series of ( mostly collapsed ) megaliths , stone circles , and cairns .\nThe cemetery site dates from between 3000 BCE and 2300 BCE , believed to have been created by Africa \u2019 s earliest nomadic herders who returned to the same spot to inter their dead and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone beads , ivory , animal teeth , rings , and pendants have been found buried with human remains .\nLarge sandstone slabs used to cover many of the burials are believed to have been transported to the site from some distance away , indicating that a great deal of time , effort and planning was put into the construction of the site .\nThe burial site is believed to have been in use for around 500 years , the people who created it having been forced to range further afield when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suited to herding and grazing their livestock .\nMsoura Stone Circle in Northern Morocco is made up of 167 monolithic stones surrounding a tumulus approximately 200 feet ( 60 metres ) long , 200 feet wide , and 20 feet ( 6 metres ) high .\nWhen visited and excavated by the Roman general Quintus Sertorius circa 82 BCE , Plutarch claimed that the burial mound was found to contain the body of the giant Antaeus , son of Gaia and Poseidon .\nThe general is said to have hastily replaced the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amends for the desecration .\nWhile this tale is certainly to be taken with a generous pinch of salt , it would seem to indicate that the gravesite and monument already appeared old enough in the 1st-century BCE to have been taken as a possible resting place of a figure incorporated into Greek mythology some six or seven centuries earlier .\nIn reality , the gravesite at Msoura is just one of several such burial mounds found throughout Northern Africa , albeit an especially impressive one .\nIt is now widely believed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief or king estimated to have died in the 4th or 3rd-century BCE .\nThe Torajan people of the highlands of South Sulawes , Indonesia , practice an animist faith which they call \u201c Alok ta \u2019 dolo \u201d ( \u201c belief of the ancient people \u201d ) , or Alok for short .\nIn Alok the sky represents the Father , and the earth represents the Mother .\nIn respect of the Mother , the Torajan dead are not buried in the earth but instead laid to rest in caves , natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large boulders .\nThese burial sites are decorated and closed with beautifully carved doors .\nLo \u2019 ko Ma \u2019 ta is considered as the largest stone boulder burial site , but other notable examples can be found at the cave of Tampang Allo , and outside Kalimbuang Bori Village .\nKalimbuang Bori is also home to some of the best examples of the region \u2019 s menhir monoliths ; being the location of the largest menhir stone field in the highlands .\nThese megaliths are still erected as a lasting representation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are dedicated .\nThe height of each stone indicates how many water buffaloes were slaughtered for their funeral ceremonies .\nWhile not grave markers in the true sense , each stone nevertheless represents a distinct individual and serves as a lasting reminder of their legacy .\nIn West Sumba , also in Indonesia , the Marapu people likewise continue a similar practice .\nThis , perhaps , gives us some insight into the possible intended purpose and meaning of similar , more ancient , monuments elsewhere .\nIshi no H\u014dden is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u014cshiko Jinja Shinto shrine , located in the city of Takasago , Hy\u014dgo Prefecture in the Kansai region of Japan .\nMentioned in the 7th-century CE text Harima Kokudo Fudoki , Ishi no H\u014dden \u2019 s origin , age , and purpose remain complete mysteries .\nThe 500-ton carved block of tuff ( volcanic rock ) sits in a rectangular carved pond , which fills naturally with rainwater .\nThe base of the monument has been deliberately carved in such as way so that the huge block of stone appears to float @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 feet ( 6.4 metres ) wide , 24 feet ( 23.6 metres ) thick , and 19 feet ( 5.7 metres ) high , the strange monument is surrounded on three sides by unprocessed bedrock , but it is possible to walk all the way around and to view each of its carved sides .\nMasuda no Iwafune ( the \u201c Rock Ship of Masuda \u201d ) is another highly unconventional and mysterious Japanese megalith .\nLocated on a hill near Okadera railway station , in the city of Kashihara , Nara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as an overturned boat or ship carved from granite .\nThere has been speculation that the 800-ton monument \u2013 measuring 36 feet ( 11 metres ) long , 26 feet ( 8 metres ) wide , and 15 feet ( 4.6 metres ) high \u2013 once served as an astronomical observation point .\nA ridge line across the top of the monument seems to run parallel to the mountain ridge in Asuka , lining up with the sunset on a certain day of the year .\nThis day was important in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it signalled the beginning of the agricultural season .\nThis theory has been rejected by most scholars , however .\nA more popular theory is that the stone represents the unfinished and abandoned remains of what was to be an impressive tomb entrance .\nA latticework of marks on the stone \u2019 s base are taken as evidence of the laborious process by which its sides were flattened .\nHa\u02bbamonga \u02bba Maui ( \u201c The Burden of Maui \u201d ) is a stone trilithon ( a structure consisting of two large vertical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set horizontally across them ) located in Tonga , on the eastern part of the island of Tongatapu .\nHa\u02bbamonga means \u201c a stick with loads on both ends , carried over the shoulder \u201d and Maui is a superhuman cultural hero in Polynesian mythology .\nBelieved to have been constructed circa 1200 CE , the common consensus is that the trilithon once served as the gateway to the royal compound of Tu\u02bbit\u0101tui , the eleventh Tu\u02bbi Tonga ( King of Tonga ) .\nThe monument is 17 feet ( 5.2 metres ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) wide , and 19 feet ( 5.8 metres ) long , and is made of coral limestone .\nIn 1967 , the then ruler , King Taufa \u2019 ahau Tupou IV asserted that the monument also held astronomical significance ; indicating the position of sunrise at solstices and equinoxes .\nThis theory is supported by the research of Tongan historian Tevita Fale , who pointed out that a V-shaped carving on the lintel seemed to have been deliberately aligned with these solar events .\nThis claim was , however , met with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereafter .\nG\u00f6bekli Tepe ( meaning \u201c Potbelly Hill \u201d ) is a Neolithic site in the Southeastern Anatolia Region of Turkey .\nIts foundations constructed circa 10,000 BCE , the site is contains the archaeological remains of ( at least ) six distinct circular structures .\nHuge carved stone pillars there \u2013 the world \u2019 s oldest known megaliths \u2013 having once supported their roofs .\nWidely believed to be the oldest human-made stone structure in existence , unlike so many megalithic sites , G\u00f6bekli Tepe is not a monument or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a settlement .\nPossibly .\nThat is , until recently , G\u00f6bekli Tepe was known as \u201c the world \u2019 s oldest temple \u201d \u2013 a moniker given to the site by its original excavator , the German archaeologist Klaus Schmidt , in the 1990s .\nSchmitt believed that the site was effectively a Stone Age Cathedral and a place of pilgrimage for Neolithic people who feasted and sacrificed there .\nExciting names like the Cult of the Dead , and Neolithic Skull Cult , have subsequently been linked with the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excavations and analyses seem to point toward the idea that G\u00f6bekli Tepe may be the remains of a Stone Age village .\nWhen the people who built G\u00f6bekli Tepe lived in the region , the climate was substantially hotter and wetter than it is today .\nThis meant that the area was perfect for grazing animals , both wild and ( semi ) domesticated , and that both cereals such as barley and wheat , and trees like pistachio and almond grew plentifully .\nGrinding stones and mortar and pestle found at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once processed on a large scale there .\nArchaeozoological evidence shows that gazelle were hunted , butchered , and eaten on site , again on a large scale .\nIn recent years it has even been speculated that cisterns found carved into the bedrock under the site may have been used for storing rainwater .\nToday , 95 % of the G\u00f6bekli Tepe site remains unexcavated , meaning that there is still a great deal to be learned about this fascinating ancient site , its purpose , and its uses .\nKarahan Tepe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) East South East of G\u00f6bekli Tepe , in \u015eanl\u0131urfa Province , Turkey .\nA piece published in the Turkish daily newspaper the Daily Sabah in 2020 reported that \u201c Excavations [ at the Karahan Tepe site ] have uncovered 250 obelisks featuring animal figures \u201c .\nDiscovered in 1997 , excavations on the Karahan Tepe site did not begin properly until 2019 .\nThough the obilisks discovered there are officially called T-shaped , they also ( to me , at least ) seem to bear a fair resemblance to mushrooms .\nSimilar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G\u00f6bekli Tepe , reinforcing the links between the two sites .\nInterviewed in 2019 , Professor Necmi Karul of Istanbul University , head of the excavations , had this to say : \u201c Life in G\u00f6beklitepe is not only limited to a period of \u2018 T \u2019 -shaped stones .\nIt reflects a much longer process , there is a settlement of 700 to 800 years .\nIt is certain that Karahantepe is somewhere in this period .\nIt may cover a longer period of time or it may begin before .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at least we can say that this process coincides with a significant time period , a contemporary period .\nThis means 11,500 years before today .\nWe believe that the fact that Karahantepe is within the Tek Tek Mountains National Park will provide an opportunity for different projects integrated with archaeology.\n\u201c By 2021 , excavations had uncovered the remains of prehistoric structures at the site which closely resembled those at G\u00f6bekli Tepe .\nA statue of a human figure with a leopard on its back also appears to correspond with similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site .\nIn truth , Karahan Tepe and G\u00f6bekli Tepe are just two of many Neolithic archaeological sites found across the Ta\u015f Tepeler ( \u201c Stone Hills \u201d ) uplands of the Southeastern Anatolia Region of Turkey , twelve of which contain the same characteristic T-shaped obelisks .\nMany of these sites contain evidence of mud brick houses surrounding more substantial , more permanent stone structures .\nThough evidence for these mud-bricked houses has not yet been uncovered at Karahan Tepe and G\u00f6bekli Tepe , the assumption is that these sites followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the group .\nThe Cromlech of the Almendres is a megalithic complex in \u00c9vora , in the Portuguese Alentejo , the largest existing group of structured menhirs in the Iberian Peninsula , and one of the largest in Europe .\nDating from the 6th-century BCE .\nExcavations of the site have unearthed megalithic and neolithic construction phases ; meaning that the site was used , maintained , and modified over a period of more than 2,000 years .\nA circuit of 95 granite monoliths , some of which are carved with circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of approximately 230 feet ( 70 metres ) by 131 feet ( 40 metres ) .\nAgain , the argument has been made that the stones may have been deliberately aligned with certain astronomical and solar events ; the deliberately flattened tops of certain megaliths seemingly lining up with the spring equinox sunrise and the Winter Solstice .\nThe Locmariaquer megaliths are a Neolithic complex in Locmariaquer , Brittany .\nA tumulus passage grave there known as Er Grah is thought to have been originally constructed circa 5000 BCE but expanded to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later .\nThe Broken Menhir of Er Grah is the name given to a huge stone which once formed part of a path to the tomb .\nThe menhir is believed to have toppled over circa 4000 BCE , possibly due to an earthquake in the region .\nMeasuring 67 feet ( 20.6 metres ) and weighing in excess of 300 tons , the Broken Menhir has been proved to have had to have been transported several kilometres to the site where it now rests from where it was originally obtained .\nExactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Neolithic people remains a mystery .\nThe Table des Marchand is a burial chamber , excavated and subsequently restored/rebuilt within a cairn in 1993 .\nEngravings within depict an axe and a plough drawn by oxen .\nAbove we \u2019 ve listed just a small sampling of some of the amazing ancient megalithic sites that can be found across the globe

skeptics still being skeptical and the believers still firm in their beliefs .\nBut now a new exhibition which opens today at the Cathedral of Salamanca , Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter one way or another

then , very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo choose simple words ; go slowly.\n\u201d Mantel notes that in many memoirs , readers are often expecting a revelation of sexual abuse in the writer \u2019 s past .\n\u201c That \u2019 s the usual horror , \u201d she notes , before continuing .\n\u201c Mine is more diffuse .\nIt wrapped a strangling hand around my life , and I don \u2019 t know how , or what it was.\n\u201d She then tells her story : I am seven , and I am in the yard at Brosscroft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , near the back door .\nSomething makes me look up : some shift of the light .\nMy eyes are drawn to a spot beyond the yard , beyond its gate , in the long garden .\nIt is , let us say , some fifty yards away , among coarse grass , weeds and bracken .\nI can \u2019 t see anything , not exactly see : except the faintest movement , a ripple , a disturbance of the air .\nI can sense a spiral , a lazy buzzing swirl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not flies .\nThere is nothing to see .\nThere is nothing to smell .\nThere is nothing to hear .\nBut its motion , its insolent shift , makes my stomach heave .\nI can sense \u2014 at the periphery , the limit of all my senses \u2014 the dimensions of the creature .\nIt is as high as a child of two .\nIts depth is a foot , fifteen inches .\nThe air stirs around it , invisibly .\nI am cold , and rinsed by nausea .\nI can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if pinned to the moment , I can not wrench my gaze away .\nI am looking at a space occupied by nothing .\nIt has no edges , no mass , no dimension , no shape except the formless ; it moves .\nI beg it , stay away , stay away .\nWithin the space of a thought it is inside me , and has set up a sick resonance within my bones and in all the cavities of my body .\nI pluck my eyes away .\nIt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nGrace runs away from me , runs out of my body like liquid from a corpse .\nI move from the spot .\nMy body weighs heavy , my feet have to be hauled up from the ground as if they were sticking in gore .\nI walk out of the sunlight , through the Glass Place , into the enclosed dimness of the cold kitchen .\nI say , Mum , I want to come in now , can I do some drawing ?\nI see myself through her eyes : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen in , my chest heaving to control the thick taste of blood and sick that \u2019 s in my mouth .\nI pray , let her not look at me .\n\u2018 Yes , \u2019 she says , sweetly , her back turned .\n\u2018 Of course you can.\n\u2019 It is the best yes I have ever heard .\nIt is the best yes I have ever heard in the course of my life .\nIf I had been sent out again , into the secret garden , I

never the same afterwards , I was always doomy after that : and what was it anyway ?\nI don \u2019 t know .\nSomething intangible had come for me , to try its luck : some formless , borderless evil , that came to try to make me despair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , and I think about it privately , then I scarcely laugh at all .\nWas Mantel \u2019 s \u2018 sensitivity \u2019 to an unseen world a consequence of some sort of neurological condition ?\nShe remarks that she regularly suffered from migraines , and that is was \u201c within the migraine aura that my words came out wrong , that the door disappeared into a black space : it was within the aura that I heard the dull hum and the muttering on the left-hand side of my head.\n\u201d Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphysical fancies \u201d , it is

could be how humanity first finds extraterrestrial life", "content": "If an alien were to look at Earth , many human technologies \u2013 from cell towers to fluorescent light bulbs \u2013 could be a beacon signifying the presence of life .\nWe are two astronomers who work on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence \u2013 or SETI .\nIn our research , we try to characterize and detect signs of technology originating from beyond Earth .\nThese are called technosignatures .\nWhile scanning the sky for a TV broadcast of some extraterrestrial Olympics may sound straightforward , searching for signs of distant , advanced civilizations is a much more nuanced and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saying \u2018 hello \u2019 with radios and lasers The modern scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence began in 1959 when astronomers Giuseppe Cocconi and Philip Morrison showed that radio transmissions from Earth could be detected by radio telescopes at interstellar distances .\nThe same year , Frank Drake , launched the first SETI search , Project Ozma , by pointing a large radio telescope a two nearby Sun-like stars to see if he could detect any radio signals coming from them .\nFollowing the invention of the laser in 1960 , astronomers showed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant planets .\nThese first , foundational attempts to detect radio or laser signals from another civilization were all looking for focused , powerful signals that would have been intentionally sent to the solar system and meant to be found .\nGiven the technological limitations of the 1960s , astronomers did not give serious thought to searching for broadcast signals \u2013 like television and radio broadcasts on Earth \u2013 that would leak into space .\nBut a beam of a radio signal , with all of its power focused towards Earth , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just picture the difference between a laser and a weak light bulb .\nThe search for intentional radio and laser signals is still one of the most popular SETI strategies today .\nHowever , this approach assumes that extraterrestrial civilizations want to communicate with other technologically advanced life .\nHumans very rarely send targeted signals into space , and some scholars argue that intelligent species may purposefully avoid broadcasting out their locations .\nThis search for signals that no one may be sending is called the SETI Paradox .\nThough humans don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cosmos , many technologies people use today produce a lot of radio transmissions that leak into space .\nSome of these signals would be detectable if they came from a nearby star .\nThe worldwide network of television towers constantly emits signals in many directions that leak into space and can accumulate into a detectable , though relatively faint , radio signal .\nResearch is ongoing as to whether current emissions from cell towers in the radio frequency on Earth would be detectable using today \u2019 s telescopes , but the upcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to detect even fainter radio signals with 50 times the sensitivity of current radio telescope arrays .\nNot all human-made signals are so unfocused , though .\nAstronomers and space agencies use beams of radio waves to communicate with satellites and space craft in the solar system .\nSome researchers also use radio waves for radar to study asteroids .\nIn both of these cases , the radio signals are more focused and pointed out into space .\nAny extraterrestrial civilization that happened to be in the line of sight of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signals .\nAside from finding an actual alien spacecraft , radio waves are the most common technosignatures featured in sci-fi movies and books .\nBut they are not the only signals that could be out there .\nIn 1960 , astronomer Freeman Dyson theorized that , since stars are by far the most powerful energy source in any planetary system , a technologically advanced civilization might collect a significant portion of the star \u2019 s light as energy with what would essentially be a massive solar panel .\nMany astronomers call these megastructures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to detect them .\nAfter using the energy in the captured light , the technology of an advanced society would re-emit some of the energy as heat .\nAstronomers have shown that this heat could be detectable as extra infrared radiation coming from a star system .\nAnother possible way to find a megastructure would be to measure its dimming effect on a star .\nSpecifically , large artificial satellites orbiting a star would periodically block some of its light .\nThis would appear as dips in the star \u2019 s apparent brightness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect similarly to how distant planets are discovered today .\nAnother technosignature that astronomers have thought about is pollution .\nChemical pollutants \u2013 like nitrogen dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons on Earth are almost exclusively produced by human industry .\nIt is possible to detect these molecules in the atmospheres of exoplanets with the same method the James Webb Space Telescope is using to search distant planets for signs of biology .\nIf astronomers find a planet with an atmosphere filled with chemicals that can only be produced by technology , it may be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light or heat from cities and industry could also be detectable with large optical and infrared telescopes , as would a large number of satellites orbiting a planet .\nBut a civilization would need to produce far more heat , light and satellites than Earth does to be detectable across the vastness of space using technology humans currently possess .\nWhich signal is best ?\nNo astronomer has ever found a confirmed technosignature , so it \u2019 s hard to say what will be the first sign of alien civilizations .\nWhile many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might make for a good signal , ultimately , nobody knows what extraterrestrial technology might look like and what signals are out there in the Universe .\nSome astronomers support a generalized SETI approach which searches for anything in space that current scientific knowledge can not naturally explain .\nSome , like us , continue to search for both intentional and unintentional technosignatures .\nThe bottom line is that there are many avenues for detecting distant life .\nSince no one knows what approach is likely to succeed first , there is still @ @ @ @ @ @

"content": "Of all the weird theories that came out of the insane Pizzagate and QAnon conspiracies , \u2018 adrenochrome harvesting \u2018 may be one of the most bizarre ( and that \u2019 s saying something ) : the claim that the \u2018 cabal \u2019 of evil globalists/Satanists/Democrats/name your bogeyman that rules the world are abducting , torturing and killing children in order to gather a chemical from their blood/glands to use as a reality-altering drug or elixir of youth .\nAs crazy as the idea sounds , it serves a useful purpose for the survival of the conspiracy theory itself : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 blood libel \u2018 ( originally used against Jewish people ) to motivate hate against a certain group , simply by using the idea of children being hurt to trigger an emotional response .\nProtection of children is such a primal human urge that it seems to over-ride the brain \u2019 s logic circuits , with conspiracy theorists willing to overlook quite obvious flaws in the conspiracy theory once they \u2019 ve been hooked by the emotional bait .\nBut it should be pointed out that adrenochrome is actually the name of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxidation of the hormone and medication adrenaline .\nAnd blurring the lines between fiction and reality even further , in a fascinating thread on Twitter , neurobiologist , chemist , pharmacologist , and writer Dr Andrew Gallimore explains that adrenochrome \u2013 which \u201c boasts perhaps the coolest name of any drug \u201d \u2013 is name-dropped \u201c in some major works of 20th century literature \u201d as well : In Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , Hunter S. Thompson claimed that adrenochrome \u201c makes pure mescaline seem like ginger beer .\nYou \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much.\n\u201d And , alongside Synthemesc ( mescaline ) and Vellocet ( likely amphetamine ) , Drencrom was one the three varieties of drug-laced milks ( Moloko Plus ) served at the Korova Milk Bar in Burgess \u2019 A Clockwork Orange .\nHowever , Burgess only claimed that it would \u201c sharpen you up \u201d , which is probably much closer to reality than Thompson \u2019 s hyperbole\u2026 Adrenochrome even gets a mention in Aldous Huxley \u2019 s classic mescaline trip report , The Doors of Perception , claiming it can produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mescalin intoxication \u201d , although Huxley never actually tried the drug .\nIndeed , Thompson \u2019 s account may be to blame as one of the major origin points for the conspiracy theory , as in his book he states that \u201c there \u2019 s only one source for this stuff , the adrenalin glands from a living human body.\n\u201d In his Twitter thread , Gallimore \u2013 who has recently released a new book , Reality Switch Technologies , which details how psychedelic molecules interface with the human brain and \u201c switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 then discusses the scientific background of adrenochrome .\nThe \u2018 chrome \u2019 part of its name , Gallimore notes , isn \u2019 t because it is related to the element chromium , but actually refers to the molecule \u2019 s chromophore , which gives it a deep purple colour .\n\u201c Chromophores are parts of molecules with delocalised electrons that selectively absorb light of a specific frequency , \u201d Gallimore explains , \u201c giving the molecules the colour of the light that \u2019 s reflected.\n\u201d Gallimore then points out that scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mid-20th century : Although undoubtedly exaggerated for fictional purposes , Thompson \u2019 s claim that adrenochrome would make you crazy is not entirely fantastical , and the history of adrenochrome in psychopharmacology has some pedigree , with some major names studying the drug during the 1950-60s .\nAbram Hoffer , who worked with Humphry Osmond on the effects & potential uses of LSD in the early years , hypothesised that schizophrenia was caused by errant metabolism of adrenaline leading to an excess of the adrenochrome in the brains of psychotics ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported detecting adrenochrome in the blood of normal individuals , but DMT-discoverer Stephen Szara failed to replicate the results in his own subsequent study .\nThe hypothesis has now almost completely fallen out of favour .\nTo test the physiological and psychological effects of adrenochrome , Hoffer administered the molecule to a range of living organisms , from spiders to fish to birds and , finally , to mammals , including humans .\nResults were unimpressive compared to the known psychedelics of the time , such as LSD and mescaline , and generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter , anxiety and paranoia , with some mild perceptual changes .\nHowever , a 1957 German study reported \u201c very impressive \u201d visual hallucinations of colour and movement , and Stan Grof completed a small placebo-controlled trial in 1963 with both healthy and \u201c neurotic \u201d patients .\nGrof described a \u201c psychotic reaction \u201d in all subjects given 30mg adrenochrome , including thought disturbances and minor visual , auditory , and tactile hallucinations .\nUnfortunately , these studies all date back to the 1950s and 60s , and there \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the selection of more interesting psychedelics in the 21st century .\nErowid \u2019 s encyclopedic trip report database , however , contains just five adrenochrome reports , Gallimore points out \u2013 with none of them being particularly enticing or impressive experiences .\n\u201c A lot like the come-down from a 4 day meth binge , \u201d one person reports .\nAnother noted incapacitating headaches for days afterwards .\n\u201c Overall , \u201d Gallimore concludes , \u201c it seems highly unlikely that adrenochrome will be making a comeback as a drug of choice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molecules available for those with a penchant for interesting states of consciousness.\n\u201d Perhaps most importantly though , in terms of the emergence of adrenochrome as a key element of the Pizzagate and QAnon conspiracy theories , Gallimore points out a simple but damning fact ( for the conspiracy theory ) about the chemical : \u201c Adrenochrome is simple to synthesise from adrenaline , which is readily available , and certainly doesn \u2019 t need to be extracted from the blood or adrenal glands of children.\n\u201d If you \u2019 re interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the brain , you can order Reality

due to her efforts to include sections directly related to UAPs in the latest American defense bills , along with Senator Marco Rubio ( R-FL ) and Congressman Ruben Gallego ( D-AZ ) .\nAnd yet in this ad Gillibrand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but never mentions the issue of unidentified objects making flyovers over American military vessels , including the ones which brought notoriety to the formerly classified AAWSAP/AATIP programs which have become the matter of much heated debate and controversy over the last five years \u2014my , time sure does fly when you \u2019 re waiting for Disclosure , doesn \u2019 t it ?\nAs we have explored in previous articles , it was not too long ago that when a political candidate was asked something about UFOs , it was either to discredit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make an easy joke that would lighten up the mood .\nThe New York Times article on December 2017 changed all that \u2014even though more recently the Gray Lady seems to be on a fast-track to discredit much of what they had originally endorsed with that historical article , citing anonymous sources said to have read the last UAP report demanded by Congress , which allegedly claims most sightings can be attributed to foreign ( man-made ) technology or floating junk\u2026 like Batman balloons .\nIn fact , the only presidential candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know to have ever bothered to take the UFO question seriously was President Jimmy Carter , and as we explained on another previous article , when he tried to make good on his promise to the American people to exert more transparency on the subject and re-start another official investigation program , he was denied any cooperation by NASA and the Air Force .\nAnd yet there is another candidate whose name will hardly be found in any history books about modern American politics but managed , nevertheless , to carve a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history : Gabriel Green , who ran for United States President \u2014twice !\n\u2014 at the behest of the \u2018 space brothers \u2019 and the Amalgamated Flying Saucer Clubs of America ( AFSCA ) of which he was the founder and president .\nGabriel Green ( 1924-2001 ) was a native of California and a professional photographer , who once claimed to have had over seventy UFO sightings under his belt \u2014incidentally , Green never seemed to have attempted to take a single picture of the flying saucers his otherworldly friends drove to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that there \u2019 s no hoaxed photos tarnishing his record .\nHe was the editor of a newsletter named Thy Kingdom Come , and as the name suggests Green \u2019 s philosophical ideology was a mish-mash of spirituality and Christian morals all wrapped up with a space-age veneer to better fit the times of post-war America .\nA nice little taste of this mindset that was so predominant in the Contactee movement can be given with the song When You See Those Flying Saucers by the Buchanan Brothers \u2014Seriously , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you even call yourself a student of Ufology ?\nOne of the most interesting aspects of Green \u2019 s philosophy \u2014although not necessarily the easiest one to grasp\u2014 is the concept of \u2018 prior choice economics \u2019 , a theory developed by one Addison Brown ( a.k.a .\nJohn Believer ) who is said to be inspired by the \u201c universal principles of Nature \u201d which the people in other planets were said to follow in order to maintain themselves in harmony with the Cosmos and the Creator .\nApplying those principles not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effortlessly from planet to travel using \u2018 free energy \u2019 and non-destructive principles ( Steven Greer anyone ? )\nbut when applied to economics it allowed for a fair distribution of industry-generated wealth which would cover the needs of all citizens without raising any taxes or engaging in debt , installing on Earth the closest thing to the Kingdom of Heaven in material form ; all this , mind you , without resorting to the \u2018 godless \u2019 ways of Communism which were counter to the universal peace message the spacemen were eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever you say .\nAnother of Green \u2019 s personal beliefs , in strong alignment with protestant morals , is that \u201c God only helps those who help themselves.\n\u201d Yes , the space brothers were eager and willing to come to the aid of humankind , but not as saviors or leaders but simply as guides after we had made the earnest decision to change our negative ways and stop following the path to self-destruction .\nIt was probably because of this that Green \u2014at the behest of the space brothers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1960 as an independent .\nBelow is a paid newspaper ad that was part of his campaign , and even though Green is promoted as \u201c the Space Age president \u201d and there is a nice Adamski-type flying saucer on the top banner of the ad , the only reference to flying saucers one can find in this ad full of too-good-to-be-true promises \u2014 \u201c Inspired leadership !\n\u201d \u201c Every man a Richman tomorrow !\n\u201d \u201c A passport to paradise !\n\u201d \u201c The true stairway to the stars !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsorship .\nMore subtly , there is also a promise for the public to be \u201c told the truth rather than kept on planned ignorance of the most vital information of all history \u201d ( I wonder what could THAT be ) .\nAlas , the dream of \u201c free energy \u201d which could bring about Utopia within our lifetimes was not enough to woo the voters \u2014not to mention that whatever little press coverage Green managed to get in mainstream media was solely focused on his flying saucer beliefs .\nAccording to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on The Saucer Life independent or \u201c other \u201d votes only amounted to 0.02 % of the total count in the 1960 election in which Kennedy beat Nixon .\nYet that didn \u2019 t seem to have discouraged Green , who ended up running for president a second time in 1972 with Daniel Fry ( another famous Contactee of the saucer golden age ) as his vice-president .\nIronically he ended up having more votes in Iowa than in his home state of California , where they only got 21 votes .\nGreen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he attempted to win the Democratic nomination for California seat in the Senate in 1962 , though .\nHe got much better publicity which barely touched on the topic of flying saucers , and he ended up receiving 171,379 votes which , even though they amounted to only 8 % of the total , is still an impressive number for an outsider operating outside of the party structure with possibly less-to-none economic support to finance his campaign .\nGabriel Green died in Sept. 8th , 2001 , just when the world wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society , including the way we choose and elect our political leaders .\nOne can \u2019 t help but wonder : what would have happened to Green \u2019 s aspirations if social media tools like YouTube , Twitter or podcasting would have been available to him ?\nIn an age in which presidents are allowed to say the most egregious things \u2014like how we should nuke hurricanes or inject bleach into our bloodstream \u2014 you can NO longer say in this day and age there are ideas that are too wacky for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s public endorsement didn \u2019 t secure Bernie the Democratic ticket , but if there is something that the rise of Q-Anon should have taught us , is that conspiracy thinking has a way to infect the corridors of power if you give them enough time and a big enough platform .\nGreen \u2019 s biggest mistake might have been that he was too ambitious ; if he had planned his career more methodically and started with , say , Congress instead of the Presidency of the Senate , then who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biography wouldn \u2019 t have ended only in books like \u201c A is for Adamski \u201d alongside other forgotten characters of the Contactee movement .\nWhatever you may believe or disbelieve about UFOs , one inescapable truth of history is that absurd ideas can change the world , despite their basis on reality .\nIn the XXth century the son of a wealthy land-owner named Francisco Madero launched the Mexican Revolution because he believed in spirit communication and mediumship .\n10 years later on the other side of the globe , another charismatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he swayed the German people with irrational ideas regarding the superiority of the Aryan race .\nHere I am finishing this article without any certainty on whether Gabriel Green \u2019 s story should be seen as an inspirational or a cautionary tale \u2014there \u2019 s a certain inexhaustible optimism in him that I find somewhat endearing , and I would almost always prefer grassroot movements

"content": "Throughout the Autumnal Spooky Season on Twitter , I noticed an odd trend .\nQuestions like \u201c why are there no dinosaur ghosts ?\n\u201d , \u201c why do people never report seeing caveman ghosts ?\n\u201d , \u201c why are there no ghosts older than Victorian times ?\n\u201d , and \u201c how long do ghosts live ?\n\u201d seemed to keep cropping up online .\nWith these kinds of questions buzzing around , I thought it would be interesting to see whether I could dig up some truly old ghosts .\nGhosts that have been haunting us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even millions of years .\nAccording to the British National Trust , some of the oldest ghosts haunting the properties and estates which they look after are to be found at the Treasurer \u2019 s House , York , UK .\nThe spectres of marching Roman soldiers have been seen in the cellars of the historic property , most notably in 1953 .\nEighteen-year-old apprentice Harry Martindale was working on fitting a new central heating system when he witnessed the figure of a helmeted Roman soldier emerge from a wall .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees up , as if walking at some since-buried ground level .\nThe spectral soldier was followed by a horse , and at least nineteen others , who travelled in a procession through the opposite wall .\nThis shocking apparition left young Harry in such a state that he was forced to take two weeks off work .\nNevertheless , Martindale kept quiet about his encounter until the 1970s when he was interviewed by a group of academics for a television documentary .\nGhostly Romans are a feature of many haunted UK sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being another of the locations where the long-gone occupiers \u2019 ghosts have been , and continue to be , seen .\nIn October 2021 , Dr Irving Finkel , curator of the Middle Eastern department at the British Museum , and author of The First Ghosts : Most Ancient of Legacies , spoke to the UK press about a fascinating discovery .\nAn ancient Babylonian clay tablet created circa 1500 BCE , which had been in the British Museum \u2019 s collection since the 1800s , had recently been found to contain an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quoted in the Guardian as saying \u201c It is a Guinness Book of Records object because how could anybody have a drawing of a ghost which was older ?\n\u201c .\nHalf of the front of the small tablet is missing , but its back holds instructions for dealing with a ghost which \u201c seizes hold of a person and pursues him and can not be loosed \u201d .\nEssentially directions for laying a ghost , or for an exorcism .\nThe image of the ghost ( a bearded male figure ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fittingly , it was all but invisible .\nOnly by lighting the tablet a certain way , from a certain angle , was it possible to view the image of the spirit .\nThe instructions for quieting the troublesome spirit essentially amount to pairing it up with another lonely ghost so that the two will be occupied with each other and will move on together , ceasing to bother the living .\nHaving described the process for pairing the two in detail , the tablet leaves the would-be ghostbuster/matchmaker with the wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you !\n\u201d .\nWhy do we never see \u201c caveman \u201d ghosts ?\nWell , one theory is that we do , and have been doing for a long , long time .\nHairy Hominids is the term Cryptozoology commonly uses to describe the category of creatures which the likes of Bigfoot , Yeti , Almas , etc belong to .\nBipedal , humanoid , hair/fur-covered beasts which appear solid one moment , and yet seem ethereal the next .\nSimilarities between folkloric Indonesian Orang-Pedek ( literally \u201c short person \u201d ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homo floresiensis ( \u201c Flores Man \u201d ; also nicknamed \u201c Hobbits \u201d ) have been noted by many .\nArchaeological evidence of Homo floresiensis was discovered in 2003 at Liang Bua on the island of Flores in Indonesia .\nPartial skeletons of at least nine individuals have been recovered from the site since then , including one complete skull .\nThe oldest of these remains is believed to date from 60,000 years ago .\nIn Bukit Duabelas , Sumatra , the Orang Rimba people refer to an apparently identical creature to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short ghost \u201d ) ; being thought of as spectral or even demonic as opposed to flesh and blood creatures .\nIn European folklore , Trolls , Gnomes , Fauns , and other supposedly mythical creatures which dwell in forests , caves , and other wilderness areas also share characteristics with pre-humans , or early humans .\nHuge hairy Wild Men ( also known as Wodewose ) featured heavily in the literature ( and presumably the folklore ) of the High Middle Ages and later .\nIn 2018 UK newspaper the Bristol Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelling from Exeter to Bristol Temple Meads spotted \u201c a bigfoot \u201d from their window seat .\nAn outbreak of similar sightings took place in 2012 in Tunbridge Wells , Kent , UK \u2013 where an 8-foot ( 2.4 metres ) \u201c apeman \u201d was reported by several witnesses .\nWhilst in the USA and other heavily forested countries , arguments for as-yet-undiscovered populations of flesh and blood Hairy Hominids will always be made , in England , there really is no real possibility of such .\nSo , could such encounters the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghosts of long-deceased human ancestors/cousins ?\nIt is certainly a theory .\nWhile Dr Finkel \u2019 s Babylonian ghost is not in there , the excitingly named \u201c Vivaron , the snake-demon \u201d is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the Oldest Ghost .\nSightings of a huge ( 6-9 metres / 19-29 feet long ) ghostly rattlesnake-like creature have been reported on the land surrounding what is now known as Ghost Ranch ( formerly \u201c Rancho de Los Brujos \u201d \u2013 Witches \u2019 Ranch ) in New Mexico \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1500s .\nArchaeological excavations undertaken in the area since the late 1940s have unearthed more than a thousand dinosaur and prehistoric reptile specimens .\nAmongst these finds was the skeleton of a Triassic phytosaur \u2013 a huge ( 9 metre / 29 foot long ) crocodilian ancestor/cousin with an elongated , serpentine body .\nSpeculation that the ghostly snake creature sighted in the area could be the spectre of this prehistoric monster soon led to Vivaron , the snake

Breakthrough\u2019 in Nuclear Fusion Announced", "content": "For most of my life I \u2019 ve heard of nuclear fusion as the \u2018 holy grail \u2019 that could solve most of our energy problems , freeing us from our dependency of oil and fossil fuels .\nNuclear fission is the messy method employed in bombs and current reactors that split heavy atoms like Plutonium or Uranium , and end up with lots of dangerous \u201c mutant goo \u201d that lasts thousands of years ; whereas fusion is the process favored by Mother Nature to light up stars in space , that merges the lightest atoms in the periodic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Helium , releasing far more energy than fission and producing only a small amount of small-lived radioactive waste .\nFusion is the key to Star Trek , baby !\nThere \u2019 s only a tiny problem : Since stars tend to be ginormously heavy , and we haven \u2019 t figured out the secret of Gravity yet , scientists have been tried to overcome this by heating up hydrogen atoms into temperatures even hotter than the sun itself , with hopes of creating and sustaining a chain reaction that will generate more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start the reaction .\nThis is the promise I \u2019 ve been hearing since I was a child \u2014I \u2019 m turning 50 next year , dear reader\u2014 and in all this time the promise of fusion has remained on the horizon : within our sight but unattainable , like the sun it tries to mimic .\nThis Tuesday the US Department of Energy announced on Twitter \u201c a major breakthrough \u201d achieved by scientists working at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California on December 5th .\nUsing a method that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot like what Doctor Otto Octavius used in Spiderman 2 , the team of scientists fired up an array of 192 powerful lasers into a BB-sized fuel pellet of deuterium and tritium ( heavy isotopes of hydrogen ) , and for the first time they obtained more energy than what they initially put into the experiment .\nIn a brief moment lasting less than 100 trillionths of a second , 2.05 megajoules of energy \u2014 roughly the equivalent of a pound of TNT \u2014 bombarded the hydrogen pellet .\nOut flowed a flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fusion \u2014 which carried about 3 megajoules of energy , a factor of 1.5 in energy gain .\nThis crossed the threshold that laser fusion scientists call ignition , the dividing line where the energy generated by fusion equals the energy of the incoming lasers that start the reaction .\n\u201c You see one diagnostic and you think maybe that \u2019 s not real and then you start to see more and more diagnostics rolling in , pointing to the same thing , \u201d said Annie Kritcher , a physicist at Livermore who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a great feeling.\n\u201d 3 megajoules of energy , according to BBC science journalist Eme Stallard , is just the equivalent of what you \u2019 d need to boil 15 to 20 kettles of water ( what a British way of explaining things to the public !\nBut since the Gringos insist on using football fields as a unit of measure , I \u2019 ll allow it ) so it may not seem like a lot , but it is still a quantum leap of progress compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in 2014 \u2500the equivalent of what a 60-watt bulb consumes in less than 5 minutes .\nSo , does that mean nuclear fusion plants will finally cross the threshold between science fiction and science reality ?\nWell\u2026 not exactly .\nEven though everyone who \u2019 s been on the record discussing on this story ( whether directly involved in the experiment or not ) keep praising it as an incredible milestone , the scientists keep insisting fusion is still at a highly experimental stage , and the Livermore method ( which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other labs ) is nowhere near ready to be scaled into an industrial stage , which would require far more efficient and faster lasers \u2500Kenneth Chang in his column for The New York Times explains how the 2.05 megajoules of energy fired upon the fuel pellet don \u2019 t take into account the 300 megajoules taken from the electric grid which were needed to generate the laser pulse itself .\nBummer .\nThe silver lining in this new announcement \u2500if you can call it that\u2500 is that instead of telling us nuclear fusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists can confidently predict it is \u201c just a few decades \u201d away .\nDouble Bummer .\nHere \u2019 s the thing : These experiments take up so long because they are difficult to prepare and cost BILLIONS of dollars , and so far only governments are picking up the tab .\nThe Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is not even focusing on investigating revolutionary forms of energy ; they are more interested in ( you guessed it ) designing new weapons \u2500triple Bummer !\nSo here is my humble suggestion to all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old vinegared Gen-Xer : Stop it with the damn art-defiling climate protests that serve no-one and only make you look dumb ; instead go into the office headquarters of Exxon , Shell , BP and all the major oil companies which have greatly profited from burning our planet without any regard for your future , and demand them to invest a large chunk of their early yearnings into funding fusion experiments \u2500fusion at least has the benefit that it will be more appealing to big corporations than solar or wind , because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages at least .\nYour generation can not longer afford another \u201c few more decades \u201d of uncertainty while the world keeps heating up .\nRemember that in comic books , as it is often in life , villains have to be forced by the hero to do the right thing .", "author": "red pill junkie", "url":

Apocalypse\u2019 and the Ugly Battle Between Alternative and Mainstream Archaeology", "content": "With the release of the Graham Hancock-helmed Ancient Apocalypse on Netflix , \u2018 fringe archaeology \u2019 has certainly hit the mainstream in a big way .\n* A hit across the world , the eight-part documentary series takes viewers on a globe-trotting adventure , visiting spectacular ancient monuments and slowly unveiling its core message : that a \u2018 lost \u2019 advanced ancient civilization may have been destroyed by a comet/asteroid strike , and that the same thing could also happen to us at any time .\nThose who have read Graham \u2019 s books , from the almost three decades-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more recent America Before and Magicians of the Gods , will be familiar with most of the topics discussed and the ancient sites visited , such as the Indonesian mountain-top ruins of Gunung Padang , the jaw-droppingly ancient Gobekli Tepe in Turkey , the inundation of the world after the last Ice Age , the controversial Younger Dryas Impact Theory , and so on .\nAncient Apocalypse showcases the ancient sites it visits beautifully \u2013 the series is pure eye candy for those who have a love of history , with superb high-res @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only seen before via photos , and new angles via drone shots to boot .\nAdd in computer reconstructions of what sites might have looked like ( though I feel it \u2019 s important to emphasise the \u2018 might have \u2019 in some of those cases ) , and the visuals make this series worth watching even with the sound turned down .\nWith the sound up though , viewers are in for a further treat : Graham Hancock \u2019 s excellent narrative voice .\nThose who have listened to him talk on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get points across superbly with his fluid and eloquent speaking style .\nAnd he certainly has some exciting theories , with Ancient Apocalypse laying out the case for a \u2018 lost \u2019 civilization of antiquity that left a message of warning for future generations .\nHowever , for me , the entire experience of watching Ancient Apocalypse was soured by a couple of things .\nFirstly , the constant framing of archaeologists as \u2018 the enemy \u2019 .\nThere is nothing easier , and perhaps more profitable , than creating an opponent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into \u2018 us vs them \u2019 .\nWe have seen that in the discourse of the social media era , where toxic \u2018 influencers \u2019 and politicians have gained huge audiences mainly by framing their opponents as evil , and dehumanising them .\nIt \u2019 s an extremely dangerous path to take , and I was uncomfortable every time it happened in this series .\nI \u2019 m not sure whether this was an intentional strategy by producers , or an outgrowth of Graham being on shows like the Joe Rogan Experience where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( just in the opening minutes of Ancient Apocalypse we are told by Graham that his ideas are upsetting to \u201c so-called experts \u201d ; at another point he notes \u201c the extremely defensive , arrogant , and patronizing attitude of mainstream academia \u201d ) .\nCertainly , more than a hint of this attitude was present in Graham \u2019 s last book , America Before ( and it made me uncomfortable then too ) .\nAlthough this adversarial approach of course stretches right back to his run-ins with the likes of Egyptologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be said , may have benefited both of them publicity-wise ) , it now almost seems to be the dominant message that Graham wants to communicate , rather than the actual theories .\nAnd that \u2019 s not to say Graham doesn \u2019 t have reason to be antagonistic towards some archaeologists and skeptics ( more on that below ) .\nBut in this series , the aggravation needle is pinned on max\u2026nearly every episode makes a point of it , and demonises \u2018 archaeologists \u2019 in the process .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the series .\nIt generalises from some archaeologists who have taken cheap shots at him , and some archaeologists who have suppressed new knowledge in their role as gatekeepers , to simply \u201c archaeologists \u201d \u2013 when in reality , Graham himself does have much respect for the work done by most , as he made clear in his most recent interview with Joe Rogan : On Graham \u2019 s last note above , about gatekeeper roles : Heresy is necessary for science to move forward .\nOrthodoxy becomes entrenched in many ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peer pressure , group-think , and simply just \u2018 seeing what you \u2019 re looking for \u2019 .\nBut there is also a danger \u2013 especially in modern times , with the \u2018 democratisation \u2019 of information-sharing via the internet ( it \u2019 s notable that there are a number of instances in Ancient Apocalypse where they cut to interviews with various podcasts such as the JRE and London Real ) \u2013 to take all heretical ideas as being likely .\nThat \u2019 s not how science works , and experts are \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely know their stuff .\nThey may get stuck defending incorrect ideas that have become mainstream at times , but in most cases they are right .\nContrarianism should be used as a helpful tool to break apart those incorrect ideas that have managed to ingrain themselves in orthodox thought , not be a fundamentalist ideology in which you blindly believe every idea that opposes orthodoxy .\nGraham himself , in his book America Before , noted that his theory about an advanced civilization who saw an apocalypse coming , was \u201c pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach .\nAnd as an outsider you should expect to be challenged \u2013 not take offence at it .\nYou are taking on an accumulated body of knowledge that many people have reached consensus on , and even if that consensus is wrong \u2013 as some inevitably will be \u2013 to overturn it you should be expected to present solid evidence of why it is wrong , and be able to withstand the heat of close examination of your theory .\nAnd there is equally a need , as a heretic , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sense of humour ) about your own views .\nOtherwise how are you different to the sneering orthodoxy that you \u2019 re taking exception to ?\nOn the flipside , as someone who has spent multiple decades watching orthodox archaeology attack Graham \u2013 sometimes using straight-up ad hominem \u2013 I also found it easy to understand how he might have gradually become entrenched in a view of \u2018 orthodoxy as the enemy \u2019 .\nAnd with the release of Ancient Apocalypse , some of the reactions to the series from \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his point ( though , in a vicious circle , some of that reaction might have been sparked by his own caustic approach in the series ) .\nOne archaeologist intimated Graham \u2019 s alternative views are delusions resulting from his use of cannabis and ayahuasca .\nOther critiques have said he is peddling \u2018 a dangerous racist myth \u2018 ( or more explicitly , simply that he is \u201c a racist POS \u201c ) .\nStill more commentary has gone fully-hyped panic alarm , saying Ancient Apocalypse is \u201c the most dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be , but they don \u2019 t have much sense of psychology and how to get the public on your side\u2026if someone said a show was the most dangerous thing on Netflix , I am watching the crap out of that show .\nAs someone who has met Graham and known him for quite a long time ( though not what I would describe as a close personal friend ) , these attacks themselves seem hysterical and completely false .\nIn recent years , orthodox archaeologists/skeptics have leaned heavily into the \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy .\nThe field no doubt has a long history of association and influence from these ideas , so those old theories should always be treated with caution \u2013 and the motivations of modern \u2018 influencers \u2019 pushing these ideas closely scrutinised \u2013 but it does not automatically mean \u2018 all alternative history theorists are racist POS/Nazis \u2019 , and many orthodox archaeologists and fringe critics have fallen into this trap ( whether mistakenly , or purposefully ) .\nThe exact same accusation could probably be leveled at the fields of archaeology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a history of either promoting racist views or being used by racists for their own ideologies .\nAnd with Graham being himself part of a multi-racial relationship and family \u2013 and a long-time supporter of Indigenous rights and what most would describe as \u2018 left-leaning \u2019 ideas \u2013 anyone throwing that accusation at him , on a personal level , is plain wrong and to be honest looks a bit stupid .\nAdditionally , as Graham points out in the series , there are many real examples of archaeology and historians getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas for longer than necessary , such as \u2018 Clovis first \u2019 being overturned ( despite how many archaeologists now use it as an example of how they do embrace new theories , I \u2019 m old enough to know how long that took and the opposition it faced \u2013 even some of Graham \u2019 s critics openly note that there was a \u2018 Clovis mafia \u2019 that defended the incorrect , orthodox view at the time ) .\nEven with theories that might not have the same historical significance , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 of the Giza pyramids put forward by Robert Bauval some 3 decades ago , there seems to be no end of vigorous and illogical pushback simply because they are non-orthodox theories being put forward by outsiders to the profession .\nThe Need for a Devil \u2019 s Advocate And this is where I think the advantage of having a Graham Hancock out there writing books and making documentaries is clear : he is at his best when he lends his eloquent voice to outsider ideas of substance ( they might not necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious attention ) and fresh ideas within archaeology itself that are challenging the orthodox view .\nFrom the Sphinx weathering theory put forward by John Anthony West and Robert Schoch , and the afore-mentioned Orion Correlation Theory of Robert Bauval , through to discoveries of ancient ruins in the Americas , the Cerutti mastodon controversy , the Younger Dryas Impact Theory , and the idea of there being lost , flooded cultures of the Ice Age .\nWhen he is being \u2018 good trouble \u2019 , I think Graham brings much to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove a single over-arching theory that connects all the dots , however , there seems to be too much spurious \u2018 connecting the dots \u2019 and reliance on weaker theories/poor research that detracts from the other , fascinating material he has included \u2013 and this was my second issue with Ancient Apocalypse .\nFor example , I found things like the Gobekli Tepe \u2018 asteroid warning \u2019 evidence that was presented in episode 5 extremely weak ( I have written about this topic previously ) \u2013 and numerous episodes relied on similarly weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Including evidence of this quality not only wastes the audience \u2019 s time , it is detrimental to yourself , as it provides an easy point of attack and could lead audiences to reject all of what you present through \u2018 guilt by association \u2019 .\nIt \u2019 s kind of ironic , because Gobekli Tepe itself seems like a win for Graham \u2013 a megalithic culture back in the time frame of 10,000 years ago , as he predicted in his early work \u2013 and there is no need to over-reach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely speculative star-map presented by researcher Martin Sweatman .\nDitto for other areas where his writings now seem prescient , such as the idea that flood myths might be historical memories .\nAnd Graham \u2019 s high-profile warning of the dangers of a civilization-ending asteroid strike is itself a worthy mission on its own and has plenty of evidence \u2013 and spectacular locations and imagery \u2013 that could have been used .\nI have a ( probably naive ) dream of Graham Hancock and archaeologists working together \u2013 not necessarily agreeing , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humour \u2013 that engage the public in both learning more about what we know of our past , as well as learning to challenge what we know at the same time and engaging in some healthy speculation .\nAs I \u2019 ve said previously , whether archaeologists like it or not , Graham Hancock is one of the best publicists for the field ( I \u2019 ve heard of many orthodox archaeologists , who currently have a dislike for Graham and/or his theores , who nevertheless admit that they first got interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archaeology could use his ideas as a springboard to both engage with his audience , and lead them to explore ideas in more detail and perhaps even eventually contribute to the profession .\nSadly , with Ancient Apocalypse and its aftermath , that seems unlikely .\nAs I said , I found the series unnecessarily aggressive towards archaeologists ( and even in the ongoing debates there has been what I feel \u2013 in this modern \u2018 social media pile-on age \u2019 \u2013 was some poor and potentially dangerous behaviour , such as Graham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Serpent Mound contact who denied him filming rights , while obscuring his own peoples \u2019 details , and other people organising a pile-on of fake negative reviews of academics who critique the series ) .\nThere is a point when , in discussing outre ideas , that we have a duty to reinforce that they are speculation \u2013 we \u2019 re noting anomalous evidence , and throwing out some speculative ideas \u2013 not that they are very likely true , and that archaeologists are therefore the enemy for resisting these ideas .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in negative , real-world consequences for those being attacked .\nAs researcher Steph Halmhofer has pointed out , this casting of archaeologists as an enemy , and Graham as a victim , is similar to tactics used in conspiracism to build an audience , through \u2018 us vs them \u2019 reinforcement , and the idea that truth is being purposefully hidden ( so the evidence you \u2019 re presenting is just the tip of the iceberg\u2026even when there isn \u2019 t always an iceberg ) .\nWhen the likes of the awful Daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ideas to harvest segments of your audience for political reasons , you should perhaps realise that you might be venturing into the wrong territory\u2026 But as noted , the bad behaviour hasn \u2019 t been isolated to one side .\nA number of archaeologists and skeptics have , for many years , acted obnoxiously and not served as any sort of advertisement to the field for people inspired by Graham Hancock \u2019 s books .\nAnd the attacks in the media against the show , many coming from a few archaeological opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orthodox views in a good light ( and if anything , in this day and age of contrarianism and anti-expert sentiment , have likely driven many more people to side with Graham Hancock ) .\nBut there \u2019 s still some hope .\nI \u2019 ve seen a number of archaeologists who have engaged with the popularity of the series , and welcomed the \u2018 good trouble \u2019 that Graham Hancock might bring to the field ( while still taking issue with how he portrayed them in the series , and fair enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University archaeologist Bill Farley : As Farley says , \u201c there \u2019 s nothing wrong with thinking big and dreaming big , and I agree with those who have said that can be helpful in pushing a science to broaden its horizons and broaden its mind \u201d .\nHowever , it \u2019 s also important to make clear to your audience that you are offering a mix of interesting science and speculation , and it is absolutely imperative that you don \u2019 t persuade your audience that those who hold views that don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 the enemy \u2019 .", "author": "Greg",

Next Year", "content": "There are few close encounter cases as famous as the story of Betty and Barney Hill , the interracial couple who in the 1960s became the first publicly known case of what would later be called \u201c alien abduction \u201d \u2014 classically described as a type of close encounter in which the entities take the witnesses aboard their craft against their will ( usually subjugated by some sort of mind control ) to perform a series of painful medical procedures ( even though no two experiences are exactly alike ) .\nIn fact , over the years the popularity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the controversy surrounding it , and the numerous attitudes taken towards it by people on both sides of the UFO camp ; ranging from people who believe everything about the experience as retrieved from the memories of Betty and Barney , both consciously and throughout the hypnosis sessions conducted by psychiatrist Dr. Benjamin Simon ( an expert in trauma who used hypnosis in his practice to alleviate the stress of war veterans ) , should be taken literally ; to those who think the Hills suffered from a shared delusion triggered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning from their delayed honeymoon in Niagara falls ( about one mile south of Indian Head , NH ) which was furthered fueled by Betty \u2019 s dreams over the course of weeks after the sighting took place \u2014never mind the fact that the Air Force did confirm their radars had indeed tracked an unidentified object around the time the Hills claimed to have had their otherworldly detention .\nWhich is why the recent announcement that streaming giant Netflix is planning to release a movie called White Mountains about the Hills case fills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be written by the screenwriting partners of Becky Leigh and Mario Kyprianou .\nThe writing duo also penned the 2014 movie , The Republic of Rick .\nWhat \u2019 s on Netflix also reports that the feature will be produced by Higher Ground Productions , the production company of former president and first lady Barack and Michelle Obama .\nNetflix had formed a partnership with the former first couple , and this film will be a new addition to their growing roster of films after titles like Kevin Hart \u2019 s Fatherhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The logline for the film reads , \u201c After an interracial couple in the 1960s has a horrifying encounter with a UFO , they set out to discover if it actually happened , or if it is just a case of folie \u00e0 deux\u2013madness for two.\n\u201c First red flag for me is that the movie is produced by the Obamas .\nThroughout the years I \u2019 ve written on several occasions on how former president Barack Obama has always treated the UFO subject as a comedy punchline , even after the phenomenon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was forced to admit that Yes , there are things out there that reputable witnesses like Navy pilots report from time to time which escape mundane explanations .\nWill White Mountains signal a total 180-degree on his attitude toward UFOs , now that they \u2019 ve gotten a new shiny coat of paint and a flashy new acronym \u2014Unidentified Anomalous ( n\u00e9e \u2018 Aerial \u2019 ) Phenomena , or UAP\u2014 which increases their respectability ?\nMaybe\u2026 But it still feels like exploitation for personal gain .\nAnother aspect of this project that gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the granddaughter of Barney who is a known UFC fighter , is also involved with the production .\nNow , I have absolutely nothing against Angela ( and for the interests of disclosure , I am not a fan of mixed martial arts ) but I seem to recall that when she began to talk about his grandfather and the UFO case he was famous for ( this was on a podcast broadcast seven years ago ) she distinctively gave the impression that members of her side of the family did not fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact it was their opinion that Barney had somehow been \u2018 bewitched \u2019 by his wife Betty .\nFrom the looks of more recent interviews though , it seems she either changed her claims somehow or she clarified it more : The \u201c other grandmother \u201d being Barney \u2019 s first wife , with which he fathered two sons ( before she divorced her and married Betty ) who have never been interviewed by the media about the case as far as I know .\nIncidentally , in that old podcast interview Angela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family wanted nothing to do with her grandfather \u2019 s UFO story , \u201c unless money was involved ; \u201d I guess a Netflix deal would definitely change that\u2026 Yet it still seems odd that Kathleen Marden \u2014Betty \u2019 s niece who is a prominent UFO researcher and co-wrote the book Captured !\nWith Stanton Friedman about her uncles \u2019 experiences\u2014 doesn \u2019 t seem to be involved with this project .\nWhy wouldn \u2019 t the producers want someone who actually knew Barney ( unlike Angela , who was born in \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ?\nSo , once again , I eagerly await the release of White Mountains with some trepidation .\nNo doubt it will be a top-notch cinematic production that will explore racial tensions in the United States in the mid-XXth century , and the implications thereof within an interracial couple who also happened to be heavily involved with the civil rights movement .\nBut how the UFO component \u2014which is the sole reason Betty and Barney are remembered outside their family circles\u2014 will be treated , here it is hoping it will at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap joke .\nOh , and good luck to whomever is charged with trying to outperform James Earl Jones !",
