9/11 Truth", "content": "Noam Chomsky has been one of the leading dissident voices on the American left for decades .\nAccordingly , people put a lot of stock in what he has to say on a plethora of topics .\nAs with any leading figure , Chomsky \u2019 s following contains a cultic subset that takes his word as gospel warranting no critical scrutiny .\nUnfortunately , Chomsky has demonstrated very poor reasoning when asked about the anomalies of 9/11 that appear to undermine the official story repeated by media and government .\nThe following excerpt was a response given by Chomsky to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypotheses of 9/11 , pejoratively labeled \u201c conspiracy theories.\n\u201d We will proceed by parsing the various premises contained in this statement .\nThis scrutiny will show how Chomsky \u2019 s deceptive framing and exclusion of evidence distorts his conclusions , especially given more recent revelations .\nDisappointingly , Chomsky has given no indication of updating or amending his views as he has made similarly dismissive comments on other occasions .\nHe has continually diminished the importance of expert opinions concerning the building collapses .\nHe has also given the same erroneous counterfactual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in multiple talks .\nUnfortunately , the substance of Chomsky \u2019 s arguments evaporates upon close analytical scrutiny , revealing a vacuous adherence to the official account .\nThis analysis is not an exhaustive examination of all the oddities that are difficult to reconcile with the official account of 9/11 ( e.g.\n, suspiciously timed war games , indications of insider trading , Bush family connections to the company that ran security in the WTC complex , etc. )\n.\nIt is a more modest charge .\nThe purpose of which is merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by Chomsky to bolster the mainstream narrative are fallacious and misleading .\nArchitects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth ( AE911 ) is the group of \u201c a thousand people \u201d that Chomsky and his interlocutor were referring to .\nIncidentally , today ( 2022 ) they number over 3,500 experts .\nChomsky gives a subtle slight by remarking on how they are \u201c basically unknown.\n\u201d This is irrelevant as it does not reflect the quality of their credentials or relevance of their expertise .\nAfter all , how many architects or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt is also important to highlight the fact that since the time of these comments by Chomsky , AE911 has attempted essentially what he recommended : They even commissioned an independent study of the World Trade Center 7 ( WTC 7 ) collapse , which found the officially sanctioned explanation by The National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) completely untenable : There was even an attempt to engage NIST to amend its conclusions , based partially on the findings of the UAF study : Chomsky \u2019 assertion that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d the \u201c claims about technical facts \u201d made by AE911 cues his followers to ignore the issue altogether .\n[ 1 ] It is an odd statement since it is perfectly legitimate and commonplace to repeat expert opinions without possessing their expertise ourselves .\nChomsky often accuses 9/11 Truth researchers of claiming to be experts in engineering and physics after spending an hour on the internet .\n\u201c Now there happen to be a lot of people around who spent an hour on the internet and think they know a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of actual experts is not the same as pretending to be such an expert .\nChomsky likes to conflate the two in an attempt to strawman the Truth movement .\nAlso , one doesn \u2019 t require advanced degrees in engineering to recognize that NIST is not offering substantive rebuttals to AE911 \u2019 s attempt to engage them in a constructive technical dialogue .\nA layperson can see that NIST is avoiding the issue , presumably because they don \u2019 t have a counterargument of scientific merit .\nBy skirting this issue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official narrative .\nA controlled demolition would have to be explained as either unconnected with the terrorist events or somehow compatible with the mainstream hypothesis that no powerful domestic actors were involved .\nBoth seem like challenging cases to make .\nNC : \u201c And they also diverted their efforts to a sideshow \u2013 invading Afghanistan for which there was very little purpose\u2026 and getting themselves caught up in that .\nAnd delaying the invasion of Iraq , which they wanted in the first place .\nSo , they [ Bush administration officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , short of lunacy \u201d .\n[ 1 ] Afghanistan was no sideshow .\nIn fact , there were plans to invade prior to 9/11 .\nChomsky reiterates the prevarication that the intervention in Afghanistan was only done as a response for the September 2001 terrorist attacks .\nHad this been the case , would we expect planning for an imminent invasion before the attacks even occurred ?\nIt seems highly doubtful to say the least .\nConsider the following proof of a pre-9/11 plan to invade : \u201c The first draft of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Presidential directive , was circulated by the NSC staff on June 7 , 2001 and I am told some five more meetings were held that summer at the Deputy Secretary level to address the policy questions involved , such as relating an aggressive strategy against the Taliban to U.S.-Pakistan relations .\nBy the first week of September , this process had arrived at a strategy that was presented to Principals and later became National Security Presidential Directive ( NSPD ) -9 .\nThe objectives of the new strategy were : \u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so \u2014 diplomatic , military , economic , intelligence , information and law enforcement ; \u2022 To eliminate sanctuaries for al-Qaeda and related terrorist networks \u2013 and if diplomatic efforts to do so failed , to consider additional measures .\nThe essence of this strategy was contained in NSPD-9 .\nIt was the first major substantive national security decision directive issued by this Administration .\nIt was presented for decision by principals on September 4 , 2001 \u2013 7 days before September 11th .\nThe directive was signed by the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preamble to reflect the events of 9/11 , on October 25 , 2001 \u201d [ 5 ] .\nAs Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld explained in 2004 , the rationale for this pre-9/11 plan was to combat terrorism : This quote proves that the global war on terror was conceived before the attacks of 9/11 occurred .\nEven if we take Rumsfeld \u2019 s anti-terrorist pretext at face-value , we are still left with a reason intervention was desired prior to Sept. 11 , 2001 .\nBut the question arises : How seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only out of anti-terrorist stratagems that such a plan arose ?\nIt is important to remember that Afghanistan had long been viewed as geostrategically important due to its location relative to oil producing regions \u2013 hence the value of securing it for U.S. interests .\nSpeaking at a Cato Institute conference in 1998 , future Vice President Dick Cheney gave an indication of why such a massive operation against the Taliban might have been a priority : This strategic importance was because , \u201c The only way to get that fuel [ from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India or the Gulf of Oman \u2014 from where it could be shipped to Western markets \u2014 was by building a pipeline through Afghanistan.\n\u201d [ 7 ] It seems that Rumsfeld was only giving us part of the story .\nThe reason terrorism warranted a major military operation was because it was stifling geostrategic objectives and corporate access to a crucial region of the world .\nWestern oil and gas interests had been courting the Taliban to exploit the central Asian energy reserves through the construction of trans-Afghan pipelines : \u201c The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $ 4.5 billion pipeline network to transport Caspian Sea oil and gas across Afghanistan to the Indian subcontinent \u201d [ 8 ] .\nOsama bin Laden threw a wrench in the works when his network attacked U.S. embassies , provoking the Clinton administration to launch airstrikes into Afghanistan : Given all this , it is curious that Chomsky would characterize such a \u201c strategically significant \u201d country as a mere sideshow \u201c for which there was very little purpose.\n\u201d Chomsky \u2019 s counterfactual thought experiment is problematic at multiple points .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : First , it assumes that Bush administration officials ( and stateside ancillary parties ) would not have been bound by any limitations in concocting or facilitating the 9/11 attacks , had they played a role in them .\nIn other words , Chomsky supposes they would have had complete freedom to attribute the attacks to anyone they wished ( i.e.\n, Iraqis ) .\nBut this is unlikely to have been the case .\nIf the administration desired an actual attack on the U.S. to be successful , it would have probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sincere conviction to carry out such an attack .\nThis means there would have been a limited pool of terrorists that could have been indirectly supported to unknowingly fulfill the administration \u2019 s desire for a successful attack .\nThe conspirators within the Bush administration could have then ignored warnings of the impending crime and stifled our ability to respond defensively as we normally would have .\nThis hypothetical scenario matches the apparently intentional ignorance and obstruction of intelligence-sharing that could have thwarted the attack .\nThis extreme level of negligence does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsistency of such disinterest in the light of Rumsfeld \u2019 s previous statement about the administration \u2019 s pre-9/11 view that terrorism was an urgent foreign policy priority .\n[ 5 ] Hence , it looks more like willful ignorance than fumbling neglect .\nSecond , Chomsky \u2019 s argument assumes Bush administration planners would not have crafted or effectuated such a plan in concert with any foreign elements .\nNotice how he frames it in his comments : \u201c .\n.\n.\nsuppose the Bush administration had done it.\n\u201d It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct contact or intent to work for the interests of the Bush administration ; as any American administration would be viewed as evil to a sincere jihadist .\nIt is a general truism that a suicidal terrorist would not waste his life on a plot that would knowingly serve the interests of his enemy .\nBut it is entirely possible that the hijackers were indirectly enabled by their enemy to facilitate a desired result ( i.e.\n, a successful attack ) .\nHad this been the case , the hijackers would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind any assistance they were receiving that made the crime possible .\nThe identities of the intermediaries ( primarily Prince Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud ) that connected the Bush administration to the hijackers give indications that this was probably the case .\nIn fact , they provide reasonable grounds to suspect that the faction of ideologues surrounding Bush , with significant connections to prominent Saudi elites , could have conspired to create opportunities ( through backchannel support ) for the hijacking plot to come to fruition .\nThe network of connections that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this hypothesis is probably correct , given the nature of the relationships and aims of the participants .\nThere was a preponderance of neoconservative ideologues that populated the Bush administration .\nMany of them were associated with a foreign policy think tank called The Project for the New American Century ( PNAC ) , which was formed in 1997 : \u201c Of the twenty-five people who signed PNAC \u2019 s founding statement of principles , ten went on to serve in the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush , including Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rumsfeld [ Secretary of Defense ] , and Paul Wolfowitz [ Deputy Secretary of Defense ] .\n\u201d [ 11 ] Other Bush administration officials had PNAC connections as well : John Bolton ( Under Secretary of Arms Control and International Security Affairs , Ambassador to UN ) ; Scooter Libby ( Assistant to the Vice President for National Security Affairs , Chief of Staff to the Vice President ) ; Peter Rodman ( Asst .\nDefense Secretary for International Security Affairs ) ; Henry Rowen ( Defense Policy Board member ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Defense Science Board ) ; Abram Shulsky ( Director of the Pentagon \u2019 s Office of Special Plans ) ; Stephen Cambone ( Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence ) ; Devon Gaffney Cross ( Defense Policy Board member ) ; Paula Dobriansky ( Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs ) ; Jeane Kirkpatrick ( Representative to UN ) .\n[ 12 ] PNAC was focused on advancing American interests abroad through projection of military presence and capability .\nIn September of the year 2000 ( about a year before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bush administration assumed power ) , PNAC released a prescriptive report titled , Rebuilding America \u2019 s Defenses : Strategies Forces and Resources for a New Century .\nParticipants in its production included \u201c six of whom [ that ] subsequently assumed key defense and foreign policy positions in the Bush administration.\n\u201d The document outlined the following concerns : In the same report , PNAC acknowledged that such a desired transition would be accelerated by a cataclysmic assault on the United States : \u201c Further , the process of transformation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to be a long one , absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event \u2013 like a new Pearl Harbor \u201d .\n[ Rebuilding America \u2019 s Defenses , PDF p. 63 , Original p. 51 ] Notice how similar this sentiment is to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld \u2019 s admission that such a traumatizing attack was needed to justify the coveted plan to invade Afghanistan : Rumsfeld essentially explained why the 9/11 attacks were a necessary pretext to launching a desired military campaign .\nHe inadvertently revealed why an administration bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a motive for allowing \u2013 or enabling \u2013 such attacks on U.S. soil .\nThis is ample evidence that the people in key positions of the Bush administration ( and their ideological acolytes ) were conscious that a national tragedy like 9/11 would have advanced their goals .\nThis doesn \u2019 t mean that everyone in the Bush Administration with connections to PNAC would have been directly involved in the conspiracy .\nBut certainly there was a common ideological culture within the institutional hierarchy of the executive branch that makes a plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plausible .\nObviously , there would have been varying degrees of participation .\nThe central players would have had key roles in planning and implementation , while the more peripherally involved actors would have known to look the other way and allow things to unfold in a desirable fashion ( e.g.\n, willful neglect of warnings ) .\nPerhaps this complicit culture of intentional ineffectuality was ultimately behind the breakdown of intelligence-sharing that could have prevented the attacks .\nThe flow of crucial information seems to have been thwarted from high levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experience of then-acting Counterterrorism Czar Richard Clarke : Such deliberate stifling of bureaucratic cooperation would also explain the puzzling failure of crucial information to have reached Clarke as well : Another part of this network of potential conspirators was the Saudi elite and their terrorist beneficiaries : Consider Prince Bandar \u2019 s connections to both the hijackers and Bush administration neocons .\nDoes it seem likely that such a person would be working against the wishes of the Americans he had become so close to ?\nSenator Bob Graham mentions some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the links in the chain from \u201c Bandar Bush \u201d to the hijackers was Osama Bassnan : Note the peculiar fact that Hazmi and Midhar were the same hijackers that Richard Clarke seems to have been deliberately kept in the dark about .\nThe fact that these two specific men were also linked to Prince Bandar may be more than a random coincidence , given his comradery with the upper echelons of the Bush White House that were clamoring for a pretext for war .\nClarke speculated that the reason he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIA had been attempting to infiltrate al-Qaeda and did not want their operation interfered with .\nBut this seems an unlikely explanation as the whole point of infiltration would be to stop a terrorist event like 9/11 from occurring in the first place .\nIt strains credulity to posit a scenario in which the CIA allowed a massive plot to proceed because they were making efforts to get people inside the terrorist organization for the specific purpose of neutralizing just such an attack .\nUnsurprisingly , the CIA has denied the existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumes an absurd level of incompetence .\nPerhaps Clarke wanted to avoid the more uncomfortable possibility that the plot was desired and enabled by the administration , which is probably the ultimate reason he was cut out of the loop of vital intelligence .\nIt is noteworthy that both Clarke and Tenet identified the White House as a source of the obstructive sabotaging of intelligence sharing that crippled an appropriate response .\nTenet was mystified by the apparent disinterest of the Bush administration in the warnings sent by the CIA .\n[ 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprioritized and all his reports involving terrorism were \u201c bounced back \u201d .\n[ 14 , 15 ] Remember , Rumsfeld claimed that terrorism was a deemed a foreign policy focus of the administration even before 9/11 , as evidenced by the NSPD-9 .\n[ 5 ] Rumsfeld also admitted that 9/11 was a useful pretext for attacking Afghanistan .\nHow does one square this hyper focus on terrorism as a central plank of foreign policy with the negligent obstruction and disinterest in warnings of imminent terrorist threats ?\nA natural inference that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were allowed to happen precisely for the reasons outlined by Rumsfeld and PNAC .\nAnother connection from Prince Bandar to 9/11 hijackers was Omar al-Bayoumi .\nAdditionally , he has been shown to have been connected to the House of Saud as a member of their intelligence services : The significance of Prince Bandar as a crucial bridge within an ad hoc criminal network ( that connected American neoconservative political operatives to foreign hijackers ) reflects an elementary principle of Social Network Analysis ( SNA ) deployed by law enforcement specialists : \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically looking at people who form points or nodes in the network and they have identifiable links between one person and another .\n.\n.\n\u201d [ 22 ] This type of investigative approach is important , since \u201c analysts are predominantly using SNA as a way of identifying individuals who were not previously on the radar of law enforcement agencies \u201d ( Ibid. )\n.\nAs we will see , Prince Bandar has been intentionally kept off the radar .\nIt is rational to suspect the reason for this was to hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 9/11 attacks .\nHis connections have potentially damning implications about the extent of the criminal network in which he seems to have been situated .\nHowever , a cursory examination of his ties to powerful players in Washington makes the revelations of supportive financial flows to 9/11 hijackers ( through Bayoumi and Bassnan ) warrant extreme suspicion and scrutiny .\n[ 17 , 20 , 21 ] Were these connections merely fortuitous coincidences ?\nDoes Bandar \u2019 s personal closeness to the Bush administration and sympathies for their objectives make it likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betray those relationships ?\nThis seems highly improbable .\nBy ignoring these relationships , Chomsky offers an inadequate analysis .\nHe doesn \u2019 t take into account the probable indicators of a social network based on shared interests that could have been fertile ground for a conspiracy to ensure the success of the 9/11 plot .\nThe Enemy of My Friends\u2026 Chomsky echoes the conventional interpretation of Bush not wanting to alienate the Saudis .\nThis is a commonplace observation : \u201c Immediately after the attacks , the Bush administration downplayed the Saudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful Saudis to the funding of Islamic extremism and terrorism .\nThe Bush White House didn \u2019 t want to upset its relationship with one of the world \u2019 s largest oil-producing nations , which was also an American ally with enormous political influence in Washington .\n.\n.\n\u201d [ 23 ] Similarly , the Saudis didn \u2019 t want bin Laden captured because of fear that he would reveal information about high level-Saudi funding for previous terrorist operations .\n[ 24 ] If captured and interrogated , he could potentially bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the dynamic between the Saudis and U.S. is perhaps more complicated than Chomsky lets on .\nIt is true that there were sometimes very public tensions between Crown Prince Abdullah and the Bush II administration regarding the American position on the Israel-Palestine conflict .\nYet it is hard to know how much of that acrimony was for show ( with the purpose shoring up common cause with a very popular anti-Israeli Arab sentiment ) .\nEven granting such areas of tension , would the fear of alienating the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from perceived complicity in 9/11 , given that they were heavily dependent on the U.S. at an existential level ?\n\u201c After all , the House of Saud has long been virtually dependent on Washington \u2019 s protection for its very survival .\nArms and security guarantees supplied by Washington represent a formidable obstacle to any Saudis seeking to take their country down a different path , and have played a significant , perhaps decisive , role in keeping the regime in power .\nWashington is the ultimate sponsor and guarantor of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals , training for regime security forces , and the large-scale presence of its own troops and military apparatus.\n\u201d [ 25 ] This shows a fundamental reliance of the House of Saud on Washington .\nThe two countries had grown into a symbiotic relationship .\nThis is because : As a result of being so-tethered , the House of Saud would have been equally as worried about alienating Washington as vice versa .\nTherefore , if the people in power in the United States had wanted \u201c a new Pearl Harbor \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support from the Saudi government to the attackers might not be so hard to imagine .\nThey would have known they weren \u2019 t acting inappropriately with respect to their benefactors in Washington by supporting an operation that was ultimately desired .\nAs demonstrated above , we know that the Bush neocons wanted to enhance American global hegemony through expanded and improved projection of military power .\nIt was explicitly observed that they would need a traumatic event to rouse public support for such an agenda .\nIt is also worth remembering that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al-Qaeda within Saudi Arabia , which made dealing with them a very delicate issue for the ruling elites .\nThis conflict of ostensibly incompatible interests ( i.e .\ndepending on the U.S. to remain in power while needing to placate a largely anti-U.S. population ) was even tangentially acknowledged in the PNAC report mentioned above : \u201c Although Saudi domestic sensibilities demand that the forces based in the Kingdom nominally remain rotational forces , it has become apparent that this is now a semi-permanent mission .\nFrom an American perspective , the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saddam pass from the scene.\n\u201d [ 13 ] However , an increased American military presence in the Gulf region ( the likes of which would be justified by \u201c a new Pearl Harbor \u201d ) could be viewed as desirable to the Saudi ruling class .\nIt would give them the security of having a powerful protective ally nearby to bolster their hold on power while simultaneously facilitating a reduced U.S. military footprint within Saudi borders , which could diffuse domestic hostility to the Kingdom .\nHence , it is conceivable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as agreeable to the Saudi regime .\nSo , while the House of Saud may not have wanted to stir the hornet \u2019 s nest of domestic tensions themselves , it is far from clear that they would have been alienated by the United States blaming bin Laden \u2019 s network for the crimes of 9/11 , precisely because the \u201c Saudis are his worst enemies.\n\u201d \u201c Saudi-born Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden has long called for the overthrow of the Saudi royal family to punish it for allowing U.S. military bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monarchy in 1990 over the Gulf War , when the kingdom invited U.S.-led coalition troops onto Saudi soil to defend its oil fields and to prepare to attack Iraq.\n\u201d [ 28 ] Bin Laden had been excommunicated from the house of Saud and living in Afghanistan since 1996 : \u201c 1994 \u2014 The Saudi government officially strips bin Laden of his citizenship , freezing all the remaining assets he has in the country .\nHis family disowns him as well.\n\u201d [ 29 ] This suggests that bin Laden \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily reflect badly on a government that had previously rebuked him as a persona non grata .\nAnd the House of Saud would not have been antagonized by one of their principle enemies ( bin Laden ) catching the wrath of the American military behemoth , so long as he wasn \u2019 t put in a position to incriminate any of them ( i.e .\nthrough the opportunity to stand trial and testify ) .\nChomsky \u2019 s massive elisions make his reasoning on this uncogent .\nBack-channel support from Saudi elites for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a good way to persecute a figurehead of anti-government sentiment while achieving aims of American friends that wanted a pretext for military interventions .\nSo , blaming bin Laden ( who the Saudi ruling elite viewed as an enemy , even stripping him of his citizenship ) would likely have been within the Saudi regime \u2019 s self-interest , insofar as members of that regime themselves would not have been publicly culpable for the 9/11 crime .\nIt would have channeled perceived responsibility for the attacks away from the Saudis that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implicate , while bringing more American military force against one of the kingdom \u2019 s most hated adversaries ( who had been based in Afghanistan , not Saudi Arabia ) .\nIn fact , the U.S. government and media were very quick to blame bin Laden without any substantive evidence linking him to the attacks ; so , it didn \u2019 t seem to be against their perceived self-interest to do so : Interestingly , this is compatible with Osama bin Laden \u2019 s own statements in his first interview after the attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States .\nAs a Muslim , I try my best to avoid telling a lie .\nI had no knowledge of these attacks.\n\u201d [ 31 ] This dovetails with the dubious translations of bin Laden \u2019 s supposed confession in which certain words may have been added to make it sound more incriminating than it actually was in the original Arabic .\n\u201c Arabist Dr. Abdel El M. Husseini , one of the translators , states , \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s translation .\nThis translation is very problematic .\nAt the most important places where it is held to prove the guilt of bin Laden , it is not identical with the Arabic\u2026 .\nProf. Gernot Rotter , professor of Islamic and Arabic Studies at the Asia-Africa Institute at the University of Hamburg sums it up : \u2018 The American translators who listened to the tapes and transcribes them apparently wrote a lot of things in that they wanted to hear but can not be heard on the tape no matter how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ 32 ] Of course , this does not decisively prove that bin Laden was being honest in his denial of involvement .\nBut it does suggest that as a possibility worthy of serious consideration .\nAfter all , the mere ideological affiliation of the hijackers with bin Laden doesn \u2019 t entail that he would have been involved in every operation in which they participated .\nApparently , the FBI didn \u2019 t see a necessary connection .\nThe organizational structure of al-Qaeda was a distributed network as opposed to a centralized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is plausible that an operation could have been undertaken without bin Laden occupying a central role in its planning or execution .\nHowever , the question of bin Laden \u2019 s involvement does not affect the relevance of the information that follows , insofar as it does not negate the evidence of a social network that included both Saudi and American participants as potential conspirators .\nA crucial piece of background information neglected by Chomsky is the well-documented fact that the principle elite Saudi connection to the hijackers was Prince Bandar .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the Bush administration and agreed with their agenda .\nThe importance of this can not be overemphasized .\nAs mentioned before , it is difficult to believe that Prince Bandar ( or the Saudi regime ) would have done anything against the wishes of the U.S. , given the history of his loyalties and the Saudi government \u2019 s dependence on the U.S. \u2013 especially if they could have blamed a common enemy like bin Laden .\nFar from alienating the Saudi ruling class , the attribution of the 9/11 attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ire of the Americans onto a shared adversary of the Saudi regime .\nIt clearly satisfied the desires of the U.S. neocons in power at the time , to which the House of Saud were largely beholden .\nChomsky had it backwards .\nBin Laden was known to be behind the terrorist attacks against U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998 , so he was already in the crosshairs .\nThe difficulties that bin Laden created in Afghanistan ( provoking airstrikes from Clinton and scaring away Unocal ) turned bin Laden into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a problematic stumbling block to corporate and strategic U.S. interests .\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had already disowned him for working against the legitimacy of their rule .\nAside from not wanting to cause tumult among the restive Arabs that felt some solidarity with al-Qaeda , the House of Saud would have been simpatico with the U.S. regarding bin Laden .\nChomsky completely misses this nuance in his assessment .\nTo the extent that the official narrative was believed , it is hard to imagine an American public so-indoctrinated would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ostensibly at odds with bin Laden ( i.e .\nthe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ) .\nThis paramount necessity to narrow the focus on bin Laden and al-Qaeda is evinced by the fact that an active effort was made to shield the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from being implicated .\nAny supportive connections to the hijackers ( e.g .\nfunding ) were effectively downplayed or ignored in the official investigation of the 9/11 Commission : Such coordinated misdirection was probably intended to prevent the public from seeing the uncomfortable ( and potentially incriminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the House of Saud , and the terrorists .\nIt seems less likely to have been about alienating the symbiotically dependent Saudi regime , as Chomsky would have us believe .\n[ 25 , 26 ] It was relatively easy for Bush ( et al . )\nto direct the American population \u2019 s thirst for revenge towards Afghanistan ( rather than Saudi Arabia ) , as bin Laden had been operating from there for some time .\nThey clearly intended to focus the attention on bin Laden and Afghanistan while deflecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saudi Arabia .\nThe propagandistic utility of declaring a \u201c war on terror \u201d was its broad applicability ( not narrowly identified with one specific country ) : \u201c The naming of the campaign [ the War on Terror ] uses a metaphor of war to refer to a variety of actions that do not constitute a specific war as traditionally defined.\n\u201d [ 34 ] It was used as an umbrella policy that could encapsulate any operation in any country , so long as a rhetorical link with terrorism could be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexibility to selectively frame interventionist justifications , the Bush administration exercised confident control over which countries to demonize .\nThey obviously assumed they could guide the narrative to keep the Kingdom in the clear .\nAll of this makes Chomsky \u2019 s insistence that Saudi involvement precludes a Bush administration role in the attacks misguided , to say the least .\nIt depends on which Saudis we are talking about .\nChomsky has done his listeners a disservice by offering up transparently inadequate arguments against skeptics of the official 9/11 story .\nHe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expert testimony that has accumulated against the official explanation of the WTC 7 building collapse .\nThis issue has to be dealt with when comparing the merits of alternative hypotheses .\nIf pre-planned demolitions were involved , how does the official story ( which Chomsky prefers ) explain this ?\nCould it have been completely disconnected from the terrorist operations on 9/11 ?\nIf so , how could it have been a surprise to people that were employed there ?\nThis is a counterfactual point that Chomsky completely misses : Barry Jennings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the New York City Housing Authority , was called in to WTC 7 to assist the emergency response coordination on the morning of 9/11 .\nAfter being trapped in the building for an extended period , he managed to get out .\nWhile fleeing the area , he heard about the collapse : \u201c That \u2019 s when I found out Building Seven came down ; I was so surprised.\n\u201d [ 36 ] A normal aboveboard building demolition would have been known and expected by the people with occupational responsibilities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , someone in Jennings \u2019 position would have known about a legitimately sanctioned demolition before being called to work there .\nWhile in the building , Jennings witnessed a quickly abandoned workplace , not a scene you would anticipate had a planned demolition been scheduled for the near future : How likely would the people that so quickly vacated their work stations have even been there on a day when a demolition was planned ?\nOne could speculate that perhaps the building had been wired for destruction at some time in the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 9/11 made them decide to do it ahead of schedule .\nObviously , it makes sense that the employees of WTC 7 evacuated their work stations after the first tower had been hit by the airplane .\nHowever , it seems highly improbable that anyone would have even been allowed to report to work in a building that was in the process of being prepared for demolition , let alone one that had already been fully rigged for destruction .\nThis is an important and revealing counterfactual deduction often missed in discussions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building that had been wired for a controlled implosion would have been staffed by anyone other than the workers preparing the demolition .\nYet , the physical evidence points to a preplanned and professionally orchestrated destruction ( as indicated by the UAF study , to which NIST has no rebuttal ) .\nImagine a normal office building : Would employees be allowed to come to work in city hall if it had been rigged with explosive charges ?\nWould factory workers be allowed to continue on an assembly line had their entire facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of bringing it down ?\nAs counterintuitive as that would be , all indications are that WTC 7 had been functioning as a normal work setting for the offices within it up to the morning of the attacks .\nErgo , this was not an aboveboard implosion prepared under the normally expected protocols .\nThis is a very problematic anomaly that the officially sanctioned narrative does not even attempt to account for .\nThus , Barry Jennings \u2019 testimony is another important piece of information that Chomsky shows no awareness of or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Is a professional demolition more probable on a hypothesis that includes high-level domestic U.S. involvement ?\nOr , is it more likely on the official account that portrays al-Qaeda operatives as having sole responsibility for the events of that day ?\nI submit the former is more likely .\nClearly there are ambiguities and gaps in knowledge that deprive of us of a smoking gun either way .\nBut this need not prevent us from weighing the balance of evidence and assessing whether or not one hypothesis can be rendered most probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have .\nIf a demolition is more likely on the physical evidence , those advocating for the official story are obligated to offer a plausible scenario of how such a secure building ( that included CIA , DOD , IRS , SEC and U.S. Secret Service offices ) could have been accessed to rig an elaborate system of explosives capable of causing a symmetrical collapse .\n[ 35 , 37 ] Chomsky \u2019 s negligence of this line of inquiry reveals the intellectual bankruptcy of his approach to 9/11 .\nChomsky has violated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by eliding relevant background information .\nHe has straw-manned skeptics in the truth movement by representing their position simply as \u201c Bush did it.\n\u201d The Truth movement is not monolithic as it contains many different hypotheses that challenge the official narrative , from the outright outlandish to the more conservative and reasonable .\nThere is a plausible hypothesis that Chomsky refuses to properly entertain : It is well-established that several prominent members of the Bush administration had an ideological commitment to remaking the United States \u2019 global preeminence through militaristic means , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members at high levels of the executive .\n[ 11-13 , 38 ] These people also have demonstrable ties to the Saudis ( e.g .\nPrince Bandar ) that gave back-channel support to some of the hijackers .\n[ 16-21 ] Presumably , the U.S. political players around Bush ( and their domestic networks of power elites ) would have had a greater ability to prepare professional demolitions in a highly secured facility than al-Qaeda operatives alone would have had .\nChomsky is ignoring the possibility that these war-hungry American ideologues ( who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) conspired with powerful Saudi associates to enable terrorist hijackers to successfully attack the territorial U.S. while setting the buildings up for maximal destruction to increase public trauma and gin up a pro-war patriotic sentiment .\nThe history of associations and ideological affinities among the neocons that populated the Bush White House make a conspiracy arising from such ranks very plausible .\nKey players from this group that occupied the apex of the Executive hierarchy were intimately connected to powerful Saudis that gave material support ( through intermediaries ) to terrorists involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entail a conspiracy in the strict sense of the word .\nBut the official story is also about a conspiracy .\nBoth scenarios involve a group effort to orchestrate and effectuate a criminal plot .\nThe main difference is that this alternative account ( that incorporates prominent U.S. political networks ) has greater explanatory power with regards to certain data points that are problematic and unexpected on the establishment narrative .\nIt is true that the fragmentary nature of the information we have leaves many unanswered questions as to specifics .\nBut this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more generic theory of U.S. power elite involvement that renders the anomalous evidence ( e.g .\ncontrolled demolition , domestic political need for an attack , social networks connecting administration officials to Saudis with terrorist links , etc . )\nmore probable than the mainstream account ( that restricts responsibility to al-Qaeda ) does .\nAs we have seen , much of the data that Chomsky neglects is more consistent with this alternative hypothesis than with the officially sanctioned one .\nAs a result of his omissions and distortions , Chomsky \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the official account .\nIt is sad to see such a valued figure reduced to blatant sophistry .\nIn this statement , Chomsky slips into a common rhetorical tactic of 9/11 Truth debunkers when discussing the multitude of architects , engineers and other experts that have publicly doubted the NIST account of the WTC building collapses .\nHe downplays the significance of the number of experts ( over 3,500 as of 2022 ) that have voiced skepticism about the official account .\nThe obvious point implied by his emphasis on the \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have publicly questioned the official story is that this number is only a small fraction of the total pool of such qualified professionals , most of whom have not publicly voiced this skepticism .\nHence , the insinuation is that such skepticism is unwarranted , since it is only expressed by a minority of the people that work in those areas .\nThis rhetorical strategy implicitly relies on a series of misleading conflations and the formal logical fallacy called affirming the consequent .\nFormally , it can be expressed as the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A ] If a person is an expert that publicly criticizes the official 9/11 story , then [ B ] they doubt the official 9/11 story .\nPremise 2 . )\n[ B ] An expert doubts the official 9/11 story .\nConclusion : Therefore , [ A ] that expert will publicly criticize the official 9/11 story .\nObviously , the conclusion in this argument form does not follow .\nOne can visualize it in a Venn diagram ( see below ) .\nIf all members of A are members of B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all members of B belong to A .\nThere may be many more experts that doubt the official story , but for one reason or another ( careerism , fear of ridicule , peer pressure , etc . )\n, refuse to voice their objections .\nAnother crucial consideration is that not all experts in relevant fields have even looked into the issue and scrutinized the data .\nThe only germane opinions are the ones of experts that have evaluated the data in a scientifically dispassionate way .\nIf that group became our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be that B would be a relatively large subset ( if not coterminous with C ) .\nWe can also represent the totality of those with relevant expertise as the biggest set [ D ] , becoming the outermost circle in the Venn diagram .\nBy tacitly appealing to this totality , Chomsky may be covertly treating set C as coterminous with set D , and contrasting that fallaciously conflated set with A .\nBut the only ratio that matters is that of subset B ( i.e .\nall the relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set C ( i.e .\nthe entire pool of relevant experts that have evaluated the data in a scientifically dispassionate way ) .\nUnfortunately , this ratio is not easily accessible as we lack data on these numbers .\nYet , acknowledgment of these categorical distinctions is crucial for any honest appeal to expert testimony .\nDisappointingly , Chomsky \u2019 s comments evince a fallacy of category conflation .\nWhile this conflation is not explicitly stated in Chomsky \u2019 s remarks , it is strongly implied by the fact that he calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architects and engineers \u201d as if it has supportive relevance to his dismissal of their concerns .\nAccording to Chomsky , the reason offered by truthers for the ( relatively ) small number of vocal advocates within the relevant expert communities is that they are afraid of government reprisal : \u201c [ T ] he scientists and engineers and professional societies and physicists are so intimidated by the government that they \u2019 re afraid ; they don \u2019 t have the courage to take this position.\n\u201d [ 39 ] This might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to determine how common this explanation actually is within the 9/11 Truth community .\nBut it is irrelevant , since it is entirely plausible that straightforward careerism ( and its concomitant reputation management ) might act as a disincentive to engagement and dispassionate analysis by those with the technical qualifications to do so .\nThe threat of being labeled a conspiracy theorist for merely considering an alternative position on the building collapses might be perceived as enough of a nuisance to many professional engineers and physicists to discourage them from looking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many in set D are excluded from subset C. However , given the myopic bias that plagues the official explanations advanced by NIST ( and derivative parties ) , it wouldn \u2019 t be surprising if B encompasses a majority of the members of set C. It would certainly be a mistake to infer that A : D ( an undoubtedly small ratio ) accurately reflects B : C ( which may be very large ) .\nYet this conflation is strongly implied by Chomsky \u2019 s emphasis of the small size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of 9/11 Truth .\nHowever , once these substantive categorical nuances are introduced , A : D becomes largely irrelevant to assessing the evidential weight of credentialed opinion on the issue of the WTC building collapses .\nThe ratio of B : C is the only one that matters , no matter how difficult it may be to ascertain .\nAnother rhetorical tactic employed by Chomsky is the insinuation that a prevalent research modality of 9/11 Truth advocates is characterized by the false assumption that sufficient expertise ( in engineering and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained after devoting only a minimal time and effort on superficial investigation .\n\u201c Now there happen to be a lot of people around who spent an hour on the internet and think they know a lot of physics \u201d ( Ibid. )\n.\nHowever , this may be a hasty generalization , as we have no statistics on how pervasive this attitude has been within the 9/11 Truth movement .\nMore importantly , Chomsky should acknowledge the crucial distinction between the citation of expertise and the claim to possess said expertise .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no relevant technical qualifications , to note that the scientific objections of AE911 to the NIST report have not been answered in a substantive way .\nInstead , NIST has transparently deflected and avoided the criticisms of its work .\nIt is a natural inference to assume that NIST is behaving this way because they have no rebuttals on scientific grounds , as no other reason makes sense .\nSadly , Chomsky refuses to properly represent the problematic issues of the officially sanctioned 9/11 story .\nThrough fallacious reasoning , exclusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has revealed himself to be an unreliable analyst of these important historical issues .\n3 . )\n\u201c University Study Finds Fire Did Not Cause Building 7 \u2019 S Collapse on 9/11.\n\u201d AE911Truth , www.ae911truth.org/wtc7 .\nAccessed 29 Dec. 2021 .\n5 . )\nTESTIMONY of U.S. SECRETARY of DEFENSE DONALD H.

Booker Elementary School , 20 minutes and a world away in a predominantly black area of Sarasota .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a few minutes late , Bush would have been in his limousine , with its advanced communications , when the first plane hit the World Trade Center at 8:46 a.m. and CNN began almost immediate coverage .\nYet Bush didn \u2019 t learn of the crash until after he arrived at the school , where journalists \u2019 cell phones already were ringing with the news .\n\u201c It mystifies me why they didn \u2019 t call the president \u2014 he \u2019 s totally surrounded by state of the art communications equipment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Sarasota Magazine columnist waiting at the school .\nOf the many accounts of how Bush learned about the first crash , the most baffling comes from the president himself .\nAt least twice he has said that he was watching TV when the first plane hit .\n\u201c I was sitting outside the classroom waiting to go in , and I saw an airplane hit the tower , \u201d Bush told a town hall meeting in Orlando that December .\n\u201c And I used to fly myself , and I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one terrible pilot.\n\u2019 And I said it must have been a horrible accident.\n\u201d Bush repeated the story a month later at a similar forum in California , even though his version seems impossible \u2014 no footage of American Airlines 11 hitting the north tower surfaced until the next day .\nAccording to other accounts , Bush first heard the news from chief of staff Andrew Card or political adviser Karl Rove \u2014 both of whom were with him \u2014 or national security adviser Condoleezza Rice in Washington .\nMiller , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he and others in the receiving line were told to wait while Bush took a phone call from Rice .\nWhen Bush came over a few minutes later , \u201c it was nothing different from the normal , brief greeting with the president , \u201d Miller says .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think he was aware at the time , maybe , of the seriousness.\n\u201d Sticking to his schedule , Bush entered the classroom about 9 a.m. and , judging by a videotape of the event , seems to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five minutes later , Card slips in and whispers in Bush \u2019 s ear that a second plane has hit the trade center .\nTo journalists and others glued to a TV in a nearby room , the second crash was electrifying .\n\u201c The feeling among the reporters \u2014 me certainly \u2014 was that this was an enormous , world-shaking event , and here I \u2019 m stuck in this school , \u201d Plunket recalls .\nSome of the president \u2019 s aides clearly felt the same way .\nSarasota County Sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main office , said a Marine carrying Bush \u2019 s phone immediately turned to him and asked , \u201c Can you get everybody ready ?\nWe \u2019 re out of here.\n\u201d But no one left .\nInstead , the tape shows , Bush remains seated for at least five more minutes , although his expression by turns is somber , pensive , distracted and angry .\nThen he loosens up a bit and even appears to linger in the classroom .\nOne of the many unanswered questions about that day is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush to a secure location , as it apparently did with Vice President Dick Cheney .\nA staff report of the 9/11 commission concludes that agents physically removed Cheney from the White House at 9:36 a.m. and led him into an underground shelter about 10 a.m .\nBut the report acknowledges \u201c conflicting evidence \u201d on the exact time , and White House photographer David Bohrer told ABC that Cheney was evacuated just after 9 a.m. \u2014 right after the second plane hit .\nThat would jibe with the account of Transportation Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission indicates Cheney already was in the bunker when Mineta arrived about 9:20 a.m. Mineta \u2019 s account also suggests it was Cheney who was most involved in an early and dramatic decision : to shoot down any errant planes .\nIn his testimony , Mineta said that about 9:25 a.m. he heard an unidentified man in the bunker reporting on the progress of a plane heading toward the Pentagon .\nWhen the plane was 10 miles out , the man \u201c said to the vice president , \u201c Does the order still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c And the vice president whipped his neck around and said , \u201c Of course the order still stands.\n\u2019 \u201c Nevertheless , American Flight 77 continued on and hit the Pentagon .\nThe president , meanwhile , had left the classroom about 9:15 a.m. but remained in the school for 20 minutes , engaging in spotty conversations with Cheney .\n\u201c There was not an open line of communication between the president and vice president on the morning of 9/11 but rather a series of calls between the two leaders , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the commission he had to use a cell phone and was frustrated by communications problems that morning .\nAs soon as the second plane hit , the Secret Service should have whisked Bush out of the school , an expert on the agency says .\n\u201c With an unfolding terrorist attack , the procedure should have been to get the president to the closest secure location as quickly as possible , which clearly is not a school , \u201d says Philip Melanson , author of The Secret Service : The Hidden History @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re safer in that presidential limo , which is bombproof and blastproof and bulletproof.\n\u201d The limousine had another advantage .\n\u201c There \u2019 s the idea of protecting the president and then there \u2019 s the idea of command and control , \u201d Melanson says .\n\u201c In the presidential limo , the communications system is almost duplicative of the White House \u2014 he can do almost anything from that but he can \u2019 t do much sitting in a school.\n\u201d The Secret Service won \u2019 t discuss security measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant information has been provided to the 9/11 commission and we are awaiting final reports before making any comment , \u201d spokesperson Ann Roman said .\nAbout 9:30 a.m. \u2014 still in the school and still on his original schedule \u2013 Bush stood before students , teachers and others and told them the nation had been the target of an \u201c apparent terrorist attack.\n\u201d \u201c Unfortunately , I will be returning to Washington , \u201d he said .\nOr would he ?\nSecret Service agents and Card felt the situation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnesses agreed that the president wanted to return to Washington and only grudgingly agreed to go elsewhere , \u201d the commission staff report said .\nAgents apparently toyed with the idea of taking Bush back to the Colony \u201c because they might not be able to get the planes ready , \u201d recalls Katherine Moulton , the resort \u2019 s president .\nShe says an agent called her from the school and assured her the hotel was \u201c fully protected against anything that might happen.\n\u201d Instead , the motorcade left the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sarasota airport , where Air Force One was waiting .\nA backup plane , a Boeing 757 , was 60 miles away in Tampa .\nMiller , the Bradenton congressman , hurried up the rear steps of the presidential jet while Bush went up the front .\nHe paused in the doorway to wave to photographers , raising further questions about security that day .\nShortly before 10 a.m. , Air Force One took off \u201c like a rocket , \u201d one White House staffer recalled .\nMiller said he and Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the House aboard , were instructed to \u201c buckle up tightly \u201d and told they were going to Washington .\nSome passengers later said the plane seemed to be doing big , slow circles over Sarasota , though Miller thought it flew due north for about 45 minutes .\nThen it turned west ; he could see the beaches of the Florida Panhandle far below .\nAnother mystery of 9/11 is why Air Force One flew at least an hour without a fighter jet escort even though one had been requested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission staff report .\nDuring the time the 747 was unescorted , one hijacked plane was still in the air , other planes were missing and at least one threat had been reported against Air Force One itself .\nFighters already had been scrambled to protect Washington , and jets were readily available in Florida that morning : The North American Air Defense Command had two F-15s on alert at Homestead Air Force Base near Miami and another pair at Tyndall Air Force Base , near Panama City , according to Maj. Douglas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine by what glitch the protection was not provided to Air Force One as soon as it took off , \u201d Melanson says .\n\u201c I would have thought there \u2019 d be something in place whereby one phone call from the head of the security detail would get the fighters in the air immediately.\n\u201d As Air Force One headed toward a still-secret destination , Miller and others in the VIP area got periodic updates from Rove and a White House aide .\nBut \u201c communications were a real problem , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor and everyone had been warned not to use cell phones .\nFinally , about 11:30 a.m. , Miller and Putnam were summoned forward to see the president .\nBush pointed out that they now had an escort \u2014 F-16s had been scrambled from a base in Texas \u2014 and said a threat had been received from someone who knew the plane \u2019 s code name .\n( The White House later said there was no such threat . )\nBush \u201c was very serious , very determined , much cooler than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was very emotional because we just didn \u2019 t know at that time the full magnitude of what was happening.\n\u201d About 11:45 a.m , Air Force One landed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana , where \u2014 in contrast to the loose security in Sarasota \u2014 it was immediately surrounded by soldiers and armored equipment .\nBush was driven to a secure location to tape a speech to the nation while Miller , Putnam and others waited for the backup plane from Tampa .\nIt would have been one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , or for the next several days : At 9:45 a.m. , Transportation Secretary Mineta had ordered all civil aircraft to land , the first shutdown of civil aviation in U.S. history .\nAs Miller and most other VIPs headed to Washington on the backup flight , Air Force One continued its odyssey .\nFrom Louisiana , Bush flew on to Offut Air Force Base in Nebraska and finally back to Washington that evening .\n\u201c It was , \u201d he later said with remarkable understatement , \u201c an interesting day.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Florida on 9/11 ?\nIn the days and weeks after the terror attacks , news organizations in the Sarasota area reported several incidents suggesting he was .\nBut like so many things that day , rumor often superceded reality .\nOne of the most tantalizing stories appeared Sept. 26 in the weekly Longboat Observer , which said Longboat Key fire Marshal Carroll Mooneyhan had overheard a \u201c strange exchange \u201d between a receptionist at the Colony and a security guard .\nAs related

record of an interview and turned them away .\nTo conspiracy buffs , the incident bore an eerie resemblance to a successful ruse used 8,000 miles away in Afghanistan .\nOn Sept. 9 \u2013 two days before the U.S. attacks \u2013 Ahmed Massoud , the pro-American leader of the Northern Alliance , had been assassinated by two men posing as journalists and carrying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were the men on Longboat Key planning to kill Bush in similar fashion ?\nThe problem with this theory is that Mooneyhan denies he ever told the Observer about any men in a van seeking an interview .\n\u201c How did they get that information from me if I didn \u2019 t know it ?\n\u201d Mooneyhan asks .\nThe Observer sticks by its story .\nAll the paper and Mooneyhan agree on is that he chatted with a reporter \u2014 he says they were friends \u2014 and that both were questioned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n( The agency wouldn \u2019 t comment . )\nThe Observer also reported that two Middle Eastern men who lived in a Longboat Key mobile home park left shortly before 9/11 , saying they were going to a wedding but never came back .\nThat aroused suspicion because \u201c wedding \u201d is sometimes a code word for an al-Qaida attack .\nBut Martin Sharkey , the deputy Longboat Key police chief , recalls that the men really had gone to a wedding in Jordan and returned \u201c to find their names or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FBI and said , \u201c We \u2019 re not involved in anything.\n\u2019 I remember that was checked out and those people were back here working.\n\u201d A Sarasota TV station reported another incident : Omer Zainelabden called Sarasota police on Sept. 10 to say that a friend named \u201c Gandi , \u201d who had made threatening remarks against the president in the past , had just arrived in town .\nZainelabden , a Sudanese , then disappeared \u2014 perhaps nabbed by immigration authorities in a post 9/11 sweep of Muslim men .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 , hours after Bush left town .\nAnd Zainelabden , who had a history of heavy drinking , was still in Sarasota months later , other records show .\nBut while many reports were questionable at best , it soon became known that some of the 9/11 hijackers had spent time on the west coast of Florida and taken flight lessons there .\nThat lends credibility to the account of Darlene Sievers , a longtime bartender at the Holiday Inn on Longboat Key .\nSievers was watching TV after the attacks when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lead hijacker Mohamed Atta \u2014 the man she swears had been in the hotel \u2019 s lounge just a few weeks before .\nAtta , she recalls , came in during happy hour , sat down by himself at the bar and ordered a $ 4 rum and Coke .\nA few minutes later another man , wearing a brown , aviator-style jacket , sat down next to Atta .\nHe didn \u2019 t speak English and didn \u2019 t want anything to drink , so Atta asked for the check , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two men walked out together .\n\u201c I was sort of dumbfounded he left me a $ 16 tip with no conversation , \u201d Sievers says .\nAfter seeing Atta on TV , Sievers told her son , who called the Sheriff \u2019 s Office , which notified the FBI .\n\u201c They called me twice and did spend some time out at the Holiday Inn \u2014 I felt they were taking it seriously , \u201d she says although she never heard anything more .\nThe dining room manager and a waiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been torn down , said they too had seen Atta on other occasions .\nIt is certainly possible \u2013 Atta and Marwan Al-Shehhi , who piloted the second plane to hit the World Trade Center , trained at a flight school in Venice , just a half hour away by car .\nWhat were the two men doing at the Holiday Inn that evening ?\nWere they making final plans for the attacks that would transform the president \u2019 s routine day in Florida into one that would forever alter his presidency ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ she remains convinced that one of the men was Mohamed Atta .\n\u201c I can remember people \u2019 s drinks , \u201d she says , \u201c and I \u2019 ll never forget those piercing black eyes.\n\u201d \u2014 Times researchers Kitty Bennett and Cathy Wos contributed to this report , which also

history\u2014to experience as much as we can take in .\nThreescore-ten is not nearly enough , but some extraordinary people manage to encompass and give order to a lot of it .\nAnd some even more extraordinary people manage to rise above their own lives to interpret creation and the fabric of the universe as having consistent meaning across cultures and throughout the ages .\nDavid Ray Griffin was Professor of Philosophy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School of Theology and Claremont Graduate University , from 1973-2004 .\nWith his senior , Dr. John Cobb Jr. , he co-founded the Center for Process Studies in 1973 .\nGriffin has stated that \u201c the task of a theologian is to look at the world from what we would imagine the divine perspective , one that would care about the good of the whole and would love all the parts.\n\u201d Not only was David an outstanding theologian and one of the two best-known living scholars of Alfred North Whitehead \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cobb ) : His books also spanned the related fields of postmodernism , theodicy ( defence of God against evil ) , primordial truth , panentheism , scientific naturalism , parapsychology , Buddhist thought , and the mind-body interaction .\nAbout the time that he retired in 2004 , he was approached by some people who admired his candor , and pointed to evidence that the 9/11 event was highly suspicious .\nAt first David thought that 9/11 was simply blowback from the way America had treated the Middle East \u2014 but upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was indeed a very serious likelihood that the US had contrived 9/11 as a false flag operation to manufacture consent to occupy Afghanistan and Iraq for their oil .\nThis injustice fired his energy to research in depth , then write a dozen scholarly books on 9/11\u2014books that were not acknowledged in the media but which engaged in a cat-and-mouse game with the purveyors of the official 9/11 narrative , who continually adapted their story to cover up the weaknesses that David tracked and revealed as their tattered narrative evolved .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was The New Pearl Harbor : Disturbing Questions about the Bush Administration and 9/11 , published by his much-appreciated Interlink press in March 2004 .\nThat best-seller was followed in 2005 by a devastating takedown of the Bush Administration \u2019 s whitewash Commission titled The 9/11 Commission Report : Omissions and Distortions , which exposed 115 problems in \u201c the 571-page lie \u201d .\nFollowing these early 9/11 works , David was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in both 2008 and 2009 , and was named among \u201c The 50 People Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on September 24 , 2009 .\nIn November , 2008 , David \u2019 s seventh book about 9/11 , The New Pearl Harbour Revisited , was one of only 51 books awarded as \u201c pick of the week \u201d that year by Publishers Weekly .\nWhat followed was extraordinary .\nAs the foremost book reviewing tool in the English language , Publishers Weekly \u2019 s spotlight should have led to reviews in the New York Times , the Times Literary Supplement , Library Journal , and many other top reviewing sources\u2014but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give it a pass .\nIn 2011 , David and I founded an organization called the 9/11 Consensus Panel , comprised of more than 20 professionals expert in various aspects of the 9/11 attacks .\nIn 2018 , the 51 consensus points that were developed during this unique evidence-based reviewing project were published under the title 9/11 Unmasked : An International Review Panel Investigation ( 2018 ) .\nDuring that seven-year project , David addressed the existential crisis of climate change , penning his encyclopaedic 2015 reference , Unprecedented : Can Civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took that book to the COP21 Paris climate summit in 2015 , and presented it there , following up with a YouTube documentary on that enormous gathering of humanity \u2013 the largest meeting since World War II . )\nDavid then turned his attention to US imperialism \u2013 writing Bush and Cheney : How They Ruined America and the World in 2016 , and producing the incredible work of scholarship , The American Trajectory : Divine or Demonic , in 2018 .\nDavid was at last able , in 2019 , to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans : A Systematic Theology .\nIt is a magnum opus of enormous breadth and depth .\nIn it , for example , he confronts the science vs religion issue , showing that some scientists\u2014former atheists\u2014have been overwhelmed by the extent of exceedingly precise ratios between the chemical elements of earth that are required for life , to now saying that the universe was \u201c fine-tuned for life , \u201d thus reflecting a \u201c fine-tuner \u201d ( or divine creator ) .\nIn 2022 , as he approached the end of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostate cancer , David wrote the beautiful and crowning reflections of his maturing theology , James and Whitehead on Life after Death .\nIn the spirit of James and Whitehead , he explains that the universe is not separate from , but is within God , and is itself the very nature of God .\nThis evolving world view requires a new understanding of the divine reality \u2013 panentheism , meaning \u201c all in God \u201d .\nThe causal principles of the universe exist naturally , being inherent in the nature of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of God .\nThis chapter on the infinitely fine-tuned nature of the universe to support life is a transporting gift .\nBut he was not done yet !\nForthcoming in March , 2023 , from the publisher Clarity Press , is David \u2019 s America on the Brink : How the US Trajectory Led Fatefully to the Russia-Ukraine War \u2013 which was completed during the last days of his life .\nIn total David Ray Griffin has written 50 books and more than 200 essays .\n( He was once asked if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! )\nIn all of his books \u2013 and most notably those on American imperialism \u2013 he read and cited recent scholarly investigations from top university presses , effectively overriding the propaganda that has passed down through many years .\nPaul Craig Roberts wrote : \u201c David has served truth to the
