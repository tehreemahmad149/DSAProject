present .\nThe accusation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human rights organizations , including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch , that Russia is conducting indiscriminate attacks in densely populated

vaporized , essentially , \u201d he said .\nHave they been used before ?\nThese types of thermobaric weapons have been in development since the 1970s .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chechnya in the 1990s , and Johnson said there was some evidence that vacuum bombs were deployed in 2016 by Syrian government forces and their Russian allies in Aleppo .\nU.S. forces also used thermobaric weapons in Afghanistan in 2017 to destroy cave and tunnel complexes , Johnson said .\nThe weapons are sometimes nicknamed \u201c bunker busters \u201d because they can effectively demolish defensive barriers .\n\u201c If

4 Million Ukrainians to Death", "content": "At least 5 million people died from starvation in the Soviet Union between 1931 and 1934\u2014including 3.9 million Ukrainians .\nAt the height of the 1932-33 Ukrainian famine under Joseph Stalin , starving people roamed the countryside , desperate for something , anything to eat .\nIn the village of Stavyshche , a young peasant boy watched as the wanderers dug into empty gardens with their bare hands .\nMany were so emaciated , he recalled , that their bodies began to swell and stink from the extreme lack of nutrients .\n\u201c You could see them walking about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would drop , and then another , and so on it went , \u201d he said many years later , in a case history collected in the late 1980s by a Congressional commission .\nIn the cemetery outside the village hospital , overwhelmed doctors carried the bodies on stretchers and tossed them into an enormous pit .\nThe Ukrainian famine\u2014known as the Holodomor , a combination of the Ukrainian words for \u201c starvation \u201d and \u201c to inflict death \u201d \u2014by one estimate claimed the lives of 3.9 million people , about 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike other famines in history caused by blight or drought , this was caused when a dictator wanted both to replace Ukraine \u2019 s small farms with state-run collectives and punish independence-minded Ukrainians who posed a threat to his totalitarian authority .\n\u201c The Ukrainian famine was a clear case of a man-made famine , \u201d explains Alex de Waal , executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University and author of the 2018 book , Mass Starvation : The History and Future of Famine .\nHe describes it as \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social-economic policies and one aimed at a particular population for repression or punishment.\n\u201d In those days , Ukraine\u2014a Texas-sized nation along the Black Sea to the west of Russia\u2014was a part of the Soviet Union , then ruled by Stalin .\nIn 1929 , as part of his plan to rapidly create a totally communist economy , Stalin had imposed collectivization , which replaced individually owned and operated farms with big state-run collectives .\nUkraine \u2019 s small , mostly subsistence farmers resisted giving up their land and livelihoods .\nIn response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as kulaks\u2014well-to-do peasants , who in Soviet ideology were considered enemies of the state .\nSoviet officials drove these peasants off their farms by force and Stalin \u2019 s secret police further made plans to deport 50,000 Ukrainian farm families to Siberia , historian Anne Applebaum writes in her 2017 book , Red Famine : Stalin \u2019 s War on Ukraine .\n\u201c Stalin appears to have been motivated by the goal of transforming the Ukrainian nation into his idea of a modern , proletarian , socialist nation , even if this entailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its population , \u201d says Trevor Erlacher , an historian and author specializing in modern Ukraine and an academic advisor at the University of Pittsburgh \u2019 s Center for Russian , East European , & Eurasian Studies .\nCollectivization in Ukraine didn \u2019 t go very well .\nBy the fall of 1932\u2014around the time that Stalin \u2019 s wife , Nadezhda Sergeevna Alliluyeva , who reportedly objected to his collectivization policy , committed suicide\u2014it became apparent that Ukraine \u2019 s grain harvest was going to miss Soviet planners \u2019 target by 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough food for Ukrainian peasants to get by , but , as Applebaum writes , Stalin then ordered what little they had be confiscated as punishment for not meeting quotas .\n\u201c The famine of 1932-33 stemmed from later decisions made by the Stalinist government , after it became clear that the 1929 plan had not gone as well as hoped for , causing a food crisis and hunger , \u201d explains Stephen Norris , a professor of Russian history at Miami University in Ohio .\nNorris says a December 1932 document called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ukraine , the North Caucasus , and the Western Oblast , \u201d directed party cadres to extract more grain from regions that had not met their quotas .\nIt further called for the arrest of collective farm chiefs who resisted and of party members who did not fulfill the new quotas .\nMeanwhile , Stalin , according to Applebaum , already had arrested tens of thousands of Ukrainian teachers and intellectuals and removed Ukrainian-language books from schools and libraries .\nShe writes that the Soviet leader used the grain shortfall as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs Norris notes , the 1932 decree \u201c targeted Ukrainian \u2018 saboteurs , \u2019 ordered local officials to stop using the Ukrainian language in their correspondence , and cracked down on Ukrainian cultural policies that had been developed in the 1920s.\n\u201d When Stalin \u2019 s crop collectors went out into the countryside , according to a 1988 U.S. Congressional commission report , they used long wooden poles with metal points to poke the dirt floors of peasants \u2019 homes and probe the ground around them , in case they \u2019 d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPeasants accused of being food hoarders typically were sent off to prison , though sometimes the collectors didn \u2019 t wait to inflict punishment .\nTwo boys who were caught hiding fish and frogs they \u2019 d caught , for example , were taken to the village soviet , where they were beaten , and then dragged into a field with their hands tied and mouths and noses gagged , where they were left to suffocate .\nAs the famine worsened , many tried to flee in search of places with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while others were thwarted by the secret police and the regime \u2019 s system of internal passports .\nUkrainian peasants resorted to desperate methods in an effort to stay alive , according to the Congressional commission \u2019 s report .\nThey killed and ate pets and consumed flowers , leaves , tree bark and roots .\nOne woman who found some dried beans was so hungry that she ate them on the spot without cooking them , and reportedly died when they expanded in her stomach .\n\u201c The policies adopted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the famine after it had begun to grip the Ukrainian countryside constitute the most significant evidence that the famine was intentional , \u201d Erlacher says .\n\u201c Local citizens and officials pleaded for relief from the state .\nWaves of refugees fled the villages in search of food in the cities and beyond the borders of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic.\n\u201d The regime \u2019 s response , he says , was to take measures that worsened their plight .\nBy the summer of 1933 , some of the collective farms had only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisons and labor camps were jammed to capacity .\nWith hardly anyone left to raise crops , Stalin \u2019 s regime resettled Russian peasants from other parts of the Soviet Union in Ukraine to cope with the labor shortage .\nFaced with the prospect of an even wider food catastrophe , Stalin \u2019 s regime in the fall of 1933 started easing off collections .\nThe Russian government that replaced the Soviet Union has acknowledged that famine took place in Ukraine , but denied it was genocide .\nGenocide is defined in Article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide ( 1948 ) as \u201c any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group.\n\u201d In April 2008 , Russia \u2019 s lower house of Parliament passed a resolution stating that \u201c There is no historical proof that the famine was organized along ethnic lines.\n\u201d Nevertheless , at least 16 countries have recognized the Holodomor , and most recently , the U.S. Senate , in a 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1988 commission that Stalin had committed genocide .\nUltimately , although Stalin \u2019 s policies resulted in the deaths of millions , it failed to crush Ukrainian aspirations for autonomy , and in the long run , they may actually have backfired .\n\u201c Famine often achieves a socio-economic or military purpose , such as transferring land possession or clearing an area of population , since most flee rather than die , \u201d famine historian de Waal says .\n\u201c But politically and ideologically it is more often counterproductive for its perpetrators .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ generated so much hatred and resentment that it solidified Ukrainian nationalism.\n\u201d Eventually , when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 , Ukraine finally became an independent nation\u2014and the Holodomor remains a painful part of Ukrainians \u2019 common identity .", "author": "hqanon", "url":

electronic warfare systems .\nWhether they will have a systematic effect on the outcome of the war , it \u2019 s hard to say , but I tend to be sceptical , \u201d said Gilli .\nRegardless of their

Bayer-Monsanto , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media and academics , despite the fact that there is no scientific basis for the claim .\nWhat if the urgent \u2018 feed a growing , hungry world \u2019 is a red herring ?\nThese alarming claims are not only flawed , but dangerous , says Jonathan Latham , co-founder and Executive Director of the Bioscience Resource Project and the Editor of Independent Science News , along with many other researchers , including Serban Scrieciu , Michael Reilly and Dirk Willenbockel , Timothy Wise , Frances Moore Lapp\u00e9 and Joseph Collins .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Greatest Myth : There Isn \u2019 t an Impending Food Crisis \u201d ( April 2021 ) , he provides four reasons why the claims are wrong .\nAnd if Latham is right , Bill Gates \u2019 s approach to agriculture is not only wrong , but damaging to farmers , the environment , and efforts to combat climate chaos .\nFor decades , and despite the opposition from many sides , Gates and his foundation have been pushing a chemical-intensive , industrial-style agriculture on Africa through the Alliance for a Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a recent letter to the Gates Foundation , the interfaith Southern Africa Faith Communities \u2019 Environment Institute said : \u201c We urge the Gates Foundation to stop pushing a green \u2018 revolution \u2019 that imposes technologies and seeds that are controlled by companies with vested interests .\nRather , it should be looking at and learning from small-scale farmers from around the world who are working to build alternative food systems that are socially just and ecologically sustainable.\n\u201d Yet , Gates and the agribusiness corporations participating in AGRA push forward with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model , driven by profits and justified by the rationale of feeding a growing population .\nLatham states that the rationale is wrong .\nHe says that global food models both underestimate global food supply and overestimate demand , and so they predict a crisis when there isn \u2019 t one .\nIn his new , peer-reviewed paper , The Myth of a Food Crisis , Latham critiques the United Nations \u2019 s GAPS model of estimating food supply and demand \u2013 and by extension , he refutes the validity of all similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biofuels are driven by \u201c demand \u201d .\nAs the paper shows , biofuels are incorporated into GAPS on the demand side of equations .\nHowever , biofuels derive from lobbying efforts .\nThey exist to solve the problem of agricultural oversupply .\nSince biofuels contribute little or nothing to sustainability , land used for them is available to feed populations if needed .\nThis potential availability ( e.g .\n40 percent of US corn is used for corn ethanol ) makes it plainly wrong for GAPS to treat biofuels as an unavoidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current agricultural production systems are optimized for productivity .\nAs the paper also shows , agricultural systems are typically not optimized to maximize calories or nutrients .\nUsually , they optimize profits ( or sometimes subsidies ) , with very different results .\nFor this reason , practically all agricultural systems could produce many more nutrients per acre at no ecological cost if desired .\n3 ) That crop \u201c yield potentials \u201d have been correctly estimated .\nUsing the example of rice , the paper shows that some farmers , even under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess of those considered possible by GAPS .\nThus the yield ceilings assumed by GAPS are far too low for rice and probably other crops too .\nTherefore GAPS grossly underestimates agricultural potential .\n4 ) That annual global food production is approximately equal to global food consumption .\nAs the paper also shows , a significant proportion of annual global production ends up in storage where it degrades and is disposed of without ever being counted by GAPS .\nThere is thus a very large accounting hole in GAPS .\nThe specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporated into GAPS and other models produces one of two effects .\nEach causes GAPS to either underestimate global food supply ( now and in the future ) , or to overestimate global food demand ( now and in the future ) .\nSome of the above gets technical , but one important bottom-line conclusion is \u2014 Even with population growth and shifting diets , worldwide production can easily surpass increased demand .\nIn fact , the current and future glut will continue and will likely cause commodity prices to decline .\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may change the field of play .\nBut promoting industrial agriculture as a way to mitigate or adapt to climate change , when industrialized food systems are the leading emitter of carbon dioxide , defies logic .\nInstead , agroecology , which sequesters atmospheric carbon into the soil , needs to be promoted and scaled out to \u2022 protect biological diversity and the integrity of ecosystems around the world Alarmism about future shortages , especially given enormous faults in the calculus , should never be used to rationalize agricultural expansion , especially when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land grabs , driving ecosystem destruction and climate change , and destroying the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and the economies of poorer nations dependent on agriculture .\nFalse concern about feeding a hungry world is being used to justify AGRA-style agriculture , featuring heavy pesticide and fertilizer use and genetic engineering .\nBill Gates is dead wrong and the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa ( AGRA ) is a dangerous sham .", "author": "hqanon", "url":

medical student as it was supposed to be .\nRousseau immediately sought the help of an attorney to file for damages .\nAfter all , the doctor \u2019 s actions were a massive breach of trust .\nShe filed the lawsuit in federal court in Burlington , Vermont .\nThe jury awarded Rousseau $ 250,000 in compensatory damages and $ 5 million in punitive damages from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its punitive damages

already retired .\nStill , the Vermont Medical Board permanently revoked the doctor \u2019 s license to practice last month .\nThis is not just because of Rousseau \u2019 s lawsuit .\nThe doctor is also facing another lawsuit from a Colorado woman .\nShe , too , says that Coates inseminated her with his own sperm rather than the agreed-upon donor .\nAs the parties \u2019 lawyers have pointed out , it is impossible that Coates did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawsuits that he now owes , Coates also must pay a $ 4000 administrative penalty .\nThis is in part because the former doctor attempted to mislead the investigative committee .\nHe first refused the genetic testing , then he tried to lie about what he did to the respective women .\n\u201c While I have no present memory of ever having used my own genetic material to artificially inseminate a female patient , genetic testing has confirmed that I was the sperm donor for the pregnancy that resulted in the birth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d he said according to the board .\n\u201c I have no knowledge of , or reason to suspect the existence of any other occasion where I used my own sperm in the performance of an artificial insemination procedure.\n\u201d ( 2 ) He did not attend the hearings but did give up his license voluntarily .\nAfter all , at 80 years old , he retired quite some time ago .\n\u201c Dr .\nCoates retired from

Capt .\nJonathan Tippet , who spearheads the task force , police have identified at least 17 gangs , most based out of South L.A. and operating independently , that are involved .\nThere were 165 such robberies in 2021 and 56 so far this year , he said , including several over the weekend .\nThe area with the most robberies during that time was the LAPD \u2019 s Hollywood Division , with 50 , followed by 46 in the Wilshire Division and 40 in the Central Division , which includes downtown .\nThe Pacific Division had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood 14 and Topanga 11 .\nTippet did not say how many robberies police attributed to which gangs , but said individuals allegedly affiliated with both the Bloods and Crips have been identified among the culprits .\nSuspects who police have identified have pleaded not guilty , and their cases are pending .\nThe task force is still working to build cases against other suspects .\nThrough surveillance video and other evidence , police have identified crews rolling three to five cars deep in some of the attacks , Tippet said , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no chance or opportunity for these victims even to comply .\nThey \u2019 re just running up to people and attacking them , whether that \u2019 s putting a gun in their face or punching them and beating on them , \u201d Tippet said .\n\u201c Pistol whipping them as well.\n\u201d Shots have been fired in 23 cases , and two victims have been killed , said Tippet , who also heads the LAPD \u2019 s Robbery-Homicide Division , which investigates high-profile crimes .\n\u201c In my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ve never seen anything like this , \u201d he said .\nThe trend , in a city known for opulence as well as extreme poverty , comes at a time when crime overall is under a microscope \u2014 with homicides , shootings and armed robberies all at elevated levels since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and candidates in the city \u2019 s ongoing mayoral race denouncing those increases as they vie for voters and wealthy donors .\nThat intense focus has also caused some consternation among activists and criminal justice reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with political clout and politicians eager to please them will use the trend \u2014 based in part on fraught and sometimes false police assessments of gang involvement \u2014 to claw back past policing reforms .\nOne prominent activist , Hamid Khan , on Tuesday accused the LAPD of \u201c week after week of sensationalism \u201d about crime in the city , suggesting police were blowing crime trends out of proportion to maintain their grip on the city \u2019 s budget .\n\u201c LAPD has to constantly legitimize itself , constantly has to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising this specter of people running wild , \u201d Khan said .\nPolice said their intent is simply to draw attention to \u2014 and halt \u2014 a serious and potentially deadly surge in armed robberies .\nStill , much of the increasing violence has affected not the wealthy , but the city \u2019 s more vulnerable populations , such as people who are homeless or live in poor communities , and receives little notice .\nThe follow-off robberies first started gaining attention toward the end of last year , when the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall victim \u2014 including actor and former BET host Terrence Jenkins and \u201c Real Housewives of

with the Los Angeles Times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arrests of some of the alleged gang members \u2014 has made a substantial difference , driving down the number of incidents to just 10 in March .\nHowever , the trend is still a major concern , he said , in part because those same suspects keep getting released from jail and reoffending while awaiting trial .\n\u201c I am absolutely

Water?", "content": "Well , RT has been a credible source of information , particularly when it comes to US domestic affairs , and has offered an unbiased alternative to what has been largely a one-sided Western-Corporate-government owned monopoly that keeps getting further consolidated into fewer hands .\nNonetheless , it has its bad days too .\nThis video on a motorbike that \u201c runs on water \u201d has been circulated all over the internet and it seems to have been taken at face value by other news sites as well .\nIt sounds too good to be true\u2026 But , let \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bugger and figure out what potential explanations exist for this apparent hijacking of the laws of thermodynamics , and physics as a whole .\nThe man claims that his bike runs entirely on water , using a car battery to splice Hydrogen ( H ) from the water molecule ( H O ) \u2026 and uses a litre of it to travel 300miles .\nFirst-off , kudos to the man for getting his high school chemistry right .\nYes , Hydrogen can be ripped from water- this Hydrogen produces a bucket-load of energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a harmless by-product .\nSounds great\u2026 until one realizes that electrolysis , the process of removing hydrogen from water in the first place , requires quite a bit more than a bucket-load of energy to separate out the Hydrogen .\nIn the end , you get less than nothing back .\nNot exactly a worthwhile trade .\nOf course , one could always argue that large facilities could manufacture hydrogen more efficiently , than a motor vehicle \u2019 s engine could burn fossil fuels\u2026 .\nBut this idea is hardly new and Hydrogen-powered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFurther , electrolysis is not a new discovery .\nThere are also problems with the calculations even if we assume that he had somehow managed to convert the 1 litre of water into hydrogen , this amount of Hydrogen could hardly be enough to power his bike for 300 miles .\nAs some commenters of the Daily Mail \u2019 s take on the matter have pointed out , all this sounds like a scam : This does not pass the smell test .\nThe average motorcycles gets about 35 to 40 mpg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s say his bike gets 60 mpg .\nThe approximate energy equivalence is about 1 kilogram ( Kg ) of hydrogen equals 1 gallon of gasoline .\nSo it would take 1 Kg of hydrogen for his bike to travel 60 miles and a little more than 5 Kg to travel 310 miles .\nThe first problem is that 1 Liter of water contains about 0.11 Kg of hydrogen ( the rest oxygen ; 0.89 Kg ) .\nSo this 0.11 Kg of hydrogen from 1 Liter of water would only take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 310 miles .\nThe second problem is an average 120 amp-hours car battery contains about 1.4 kilowatt-hours of energy and since it takes about 50 kilowatt-hours to produce 1 Kg of hydrogen a single charged car battery will only produce about 0.028 Kg of hydrogen , only enough for his bike to travel about 1.7 miles .\nIn total it would actually take about 44 liters of water and 180 car battery charges to generate enough hydrogen to travel 310 mile .\nThe commenter does make ONE error though ; although one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalence of one gallon ( or 2.72155 kilograms ) of gas , Hydrogen burns far more cleanly and efficiently than gas in your average vehicle \u2019 s engine .\nIt is entirely possible that what this man is demonstrating is not in fact simple electrolysis , but some new method of obtaining energy from water .\nPerhaps he \u2019 s extracting Deuterium , or heavy Hydrogen , which has been long used in nuclear reactions and the production of the so-called Hydrogen bomb .\nPerhaps his motorcycle is a mobile nuclear reactor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three sayings come to mind : \u201c Where there is hope there is life \u201d - Anne Frank \u201c Where there is

electrolysis plates in the lower portion , and where the float is used to maintain the level of the water .\nGarrett \u2019 s patent fails to identify a new source of energy .\nAt least as far back as 1980 , Stanley Meyer claimed that he had built a dune buggy that ran on water , [ 13 ] although he gave inconsistent explanations as to its mode of operation .\nIn some cases , he claimed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a \u201c water splitter \u201d , [ 14 ] while in other cases it was claimed to rely on a \u201c fuel cell \u201d that split the water into hydrogen and oxygen .\n[ 15 ] The \u201c fuel cell \u201d , which he claimed was subjected to anelectrical resonance , would split the water mist into hydrogen and oxygen gas , which would then be combusted back into water vapour in a conventional

\u201d .\n[ 26 ] The company says it \u201c can not [ reveal ] the core part of this invention , \u201d yet , [ 27 ] but it has disclosed that the system uses an onboard energy generator ( @ @ @ @ @ @

generate energy to run the car .\nThis has led to speculation that the metal hydride is consumed in the process and is the ultimate source of the car \u2019 s energy , making the car a hydride-fuelled \u201c hydrogen on demand \u201d vehicle , rather than water-fuelled as claimed .\n[ 29 ] [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company \u2019 s website the energy source is explained only with the words \u201c Chemical

to serve as the substrate to tell some real information about the various power cliques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this off , let \u2019 s go over some basic facts .\nIn 1997 , Princess Diana , who had been reported as a kind of celebrity in the media cross all the Commonwealth Nations , the United States , and the world alike passed away following a car accident .\nAll kinds of theories about why have been presented over the years , while the relevance of understanding why a royal family member would pass away is debated .\nVarious odd facts about the situation can be observed .\nFor one , @ @ @ @

note basically served as an insurance policy .\nIn 1996 she was divorced from Prince Charles , and in 1997 she was no longer living .\nIn the note she clearly said it was her opinion that there was a scheme to have an \u201c accident in my car , brake failure and serious head injury , \u201d in her words .\nThen the next August , Princess Diana was with Dodi Al Fayed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven by a

\u2019 s the point .\nThe most powerful , wealthy old greedy men on Earth probably exist even further tucked away than we know .\nWe may not even know the names or faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greedy and

America.\n\u201d Again , his current findings echo results from previous research .\nIn a large cross-sectional analysis of US adults aged 18 to 59 using data from two rounds of the National Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , researchers from Georgia \u2019 s Emory University found in 2015 that occasional and low cumulative marijuana use was not associated with adverse effects on pulmonary function .\nCumulative lifetime marijuana use , up to 20 joint-years , is not associated with adverse changes in spirometric [ a person \u2019 s ability to exhale ] measures of lung health .\nAlthough greater than 20 joint-years of cumulative marijuana exposure was associated with a twofold increased odds of a FEV1/FVC less than 70 % , this was the result of an increase in FVC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a disproportional decrease in FEV1 [ forced expiratory volume ] as is typically associated with obstructive lung diseases .\nThe largest and longest study ever to consider the issue [ Researchers tested the lung function of 5115 young adults over the course of 20 years , starting in 1985 when they were aged 18 to 30 ] , published in 2012 in the Journal of the American Medical Association , found that occasional marijuana smoking does not impair lung function .\nMarijuana may have beneficial effects on pain control , appetite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms .\nOur findings suggest that occasional use of marijuana for these or other purposes may not be associated with adverse consequences on pulmonary function .\n\u201c Tobacco contains over 4,000 toxic substances which destroys your lungs .\nMarijuana for all we know is less toxic , probably contains up to 400 but the combination of smoking marijuana and tobacco they interact and it changes the whole thing into a poison .\nA poison which destroys the structure and function of the lungs with a lot of consequences.\n\u201d Marijuana use alone doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lungs Allen St. Pierre , executive director of the National

particular aspect seems to stand out ; that was his desire to expose the staggering inadequacies in the medical trauma care that was promised to the Haitian people by the Clinton Foundation after it had raised over $ 30 million dollars in donations following the 2010 earthquake .\nWhile Dr. Lorich was working overseas in Haiti , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical treatment promised by the Clinton Foundation nowhere near what $ 30 million dollars should have provided , but that the treatment was almost non-existent .\nIn January of 2010 , Dr. Lorich decided to send an email to a confidant detailing this affront to the Haitian people , which ended up being forwarded to Cheryl Mills , who at the time was Chief of Staff to none other that the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .\nThe doctor \u2019 s correspondence , provided by Wikileaks , was highly critical of how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Disaster management on the ground was nonexistent .\nCheerios on the tarmac are not getting it done on these patients which clearly would be savable if good care could urgently be provided.\n\u201d While this in and of itself is quite damning , considering how the anguish of the Haitian people had been used to garner funds that were clearly not being used appropriately , this email was only a prelude to what came next .\nDr. Lorich then publicly decried the horribly inept conditions in Haiti within a CNN piece entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shameful : \u201d \u201c Once we arrived , we saw a severely damaged hospital with no running water and only limited electrical power , supplied by a generator .\nSurgeries were being performed in the equivalent of a large storage closet , where amputations were performed with hacksaws .\nThis facility could not nearly accommodate our equipment nor our expertise to treat the volume of injuries we saw.\n\u201d Likely in a combination of disgust , frustration and determination , Dr. Lorich decided set up at the Community Hospital of Haiti that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet what they found upon arrival is not for the faint of heart .\nWe found scores of patients with pus dripping out of open extremity fractures and crush injuries .\nSome wounds were already ridden with maggots .\nAbout a third of these victims were children .\nThe entire hospital smelled of infected , rotting limbs and death .\nLater on , we would judge our surgical progress by the diminishment of the stench .\nIn our na\u00efvet\u00e9 , we didn \u2019 t expect that the two anesthesia machines would not work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautery available in the entire hospital to stop bleeding ; that an operating room sterilizer fit only instruments the size of a cigar box ; that there would be no sterile saline , no functioning fluoroscopy machine , no blood for transfusions , no ability to do lab work ; and the only local staff was a ragtag group of voluntary health providers who , like us , had made it there on their own .\nAs they left this horrific situation , that can only be described as a willful disregard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the outright deception of a struggling people , what they saw simply added insult to injury .\nDr. Lorich wrote : \u201c Upon our departure , we witnessed pallets of Cheerios and dry goods sitting on the tarmac helping nobody .\nYet our flight of critical medical equipment and personnel had been canceled , and the equipment that did get through was hijacked.\n\u201d While some may scoff at the possibility that the Clintons could somehow be involved with the many mysterious deaths of their critics , that have seemed to pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point the sheer volume of incidents in relation to those trying to expose the crimes of the Clinton Foundation and the Clintons themselves , aligned with the odds of it continuing to

processed in USDA-inspected plants , or treated with USDA-required chemical preservatives\u2026 because that \u2019 s how they want it , and the very reason they are willing to go to such great lengths to get it .\nBut the USDA thinks his customers are too stupid to think for themselves and need them to come in and protect them from themselves .\nYou probably don \u2019 t know ( because I didn \u2019 t until Miller told me ) that all USDA-licensed processing plants are required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grass-fed , organic variety ) with synthetic preservatives .\n\u201c Often they use citric

could invest all your energy and money producing the most healthy , nourishing meat and at the end of the day , you are ruining your meat sending your animals to a USDA facility for slaughter , \u201d

farmers to make a profit with Big Meat processors acting as middlemen .\nAnd the cost of becoming licensed by the USDA to process their own meat is too steep .\n\u201c The rules and regulations are such that you have to get into debt $ 100,000 before you ever sell your first pound of meat , and the market \u2019 s not guaranteed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s no option for farmers to start small and add on and buy equipment as they can.\n\u201d The USDA is basically telling us \u201c either get a license or go out of business .\nAnd our position is we \u2019 d rather go out of business , because their rules and regulations are too hard to follow.\n\u201d \u201c We have many small farmers in our area that would love to be farmers , but the business has gotten so monopolized.\n\u201d There should be separate regulations for large and small farms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a big difference between processing 1000 animals a day or one per week .\nWe don \u2019 t need to track and trace every animal with an ear tag and report about each one to the USDA .\nWe slaughter one animal , distribute it among our members , and then , when the need arises , we slaughter another one .\nThat \u2019 s how we eat

.\nThere is no incest .\nThere is no cross-breeding .\nWhat does the USDA label on your food doing to make your food safer ?\nNothing .\nThe chickens you buy from the grocery store \u2014 especially Tyson \u2014 have a built-in obesity gene .\nSo they blow up in five weeks to heavy weight , and you eat this stuff !\nThe cows are genetically manipulated to produce 6 gallons of milk per day instead of 2.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going out of business every week , \u201c and the past two years have been worse.\n\u201d \u201c If the government continues this harassment of small farmers , the only

There are other small farmers who sell directly to their customers , why are they targeting Amos Miller ?\n\u201c Because Amos has the most business , \u201d Anke explained .\n\u201c People want his food .\nAll over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the way it \u2019 s supposed to be .\nWe don \u2019 t need chemicals , we don \u2019 t need fertilizers .\nThe war in Russia has inflated fertilizer and grain prices .\nThey need fertilizer to grow food .\nWe don \u2019 t .\nOur fertilizer is the manure ( which the USDA doesn \u2019 t allow because their animals are so sick and toxic ) .\nBut our manure is , bar none , the best fertilizer you can have .\nAnd fuel prices ?\nAmos doesn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe \u2019 re not effected by these shortages.\n\u201d Anke pointed out the hypocrisy that farmers are legally allowed to slaughter and sell water buffalo , rabbit and fish without a license : \u201c He can slaughter them in his backyard , at the front door , in his living room \u2014 it doesn \u2019 t matter \u2014 as many as he wants .\nThere is no regulation for water buffalo or rabbit .\nIf it \u2019 s just about food safety , why don \u2019 t the buffalo and rabbit pose @ @ @ @ @

though the anthrax outbreak in 2001 killed just five persons .\n\u201c These distorted budgetary allocations , \u201d ( spending 15 times as much for germ warfare as for fighting flu ) \u201c

, who formerly reported for the Chicago Daily News , interviewed Prof. Boyle in 2015 .\nThe interview is fascinating and disturbing .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below .\nQ .\nAND A .\nWITH FRANCIS A. BOYLE ON BIOWARFARE Francis A. Boyle is a leading American professor , practitioner and advocate of international law .\nHe was responsible for drafting the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989 ( BWATA ) , the American implementing legislation for the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention .\nHis BWATA was passed unanimously by both Houses of the United States Congress and signed into law by President George Bush Sr .\nThe story is told in his book Biowarfare and Terrorism ( Clarity Press : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board of Directors of Amnesty International USA ( 1988-1992 ) , and represented Bosnia-Herzegovina at the World Court .\nProfessor Boyle teaches international law at the University of Illinois College of Law in Champaign .\nHe holds a Doctor of Law Magna Cum Laude as well as a Ph.D. in Political Science , both from Harvard University .\nQ : To get some idea of the magnitude of U.S. biological warfare research involving deadly diseases now going forward , the Federal government is said to be funding 400 laboratories globally .\nThese labs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microbes for which there is no cure .\nRight off the bat , I \u2019 d like to ask you , \u201c Is this a criminal enterprise whose dimensions are being concealed from the American public ?\n\u201d A : Of course it is !\nSince September 11 , 2001 , we have spent somewhere in the area approaching $ 100 billion on biological warfare .\nEffectively we now have an Offensive Biological Warfare Industry in this country that violates the Biological Weapons Convention and my Biological Weapons Anti-terrorism Act of 1989 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Industry that we had deployed in this county before its prohibition by the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972 that was described by Sy Hersh in his groundbreaking expos\u00e9 of it in his book Chemical & Biological Warfare : America \u2019 s Hidden Arsenal ( Bobbs-Merrill : 1968 ) .\nOur putative adversaries around the world such as Russia and China have undoubtedly reached the same conclusions I have derived from the same open and public sources , and have responded in kind .\nSo what the world now witnesses is an all-out offensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military powers of the world : United States , Russia , Britain , France , China , Israel , inter alia .\nThe Biological Weapons Convention has become the proverbial \u201c mere scrap of paper.\n\u201d But my BWATA still remains the law of the land in the United States with a penalty of life-in-prison for violators .\nThat is why the self-styled \u201c synthetic biologists \u201d proposed to repeal my BWATA so that they can use Synthetic Biology to manufacture new classes of biological weapons more efficiently .\nQ : Exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves the use of living organisms for military purposes .\nSuch weapons can be viral , bacterial , and fungal , among other forms , and can be spread over a large geographic terrain by wind , water , insect , animal , or human transmission .\nToxins\u2014living organisms such as fungi\u2014are also used .\nQ : Which are the most dangerous ?\nA : Today several U.S.G .\nlabs are at work on Anthrax , Tularemia , Plague , Ebola , Botulism , and the genocidal Spanish Flu virus .\nQ : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nA : Using DNA genetic engineering , U.S. death scientists are concocting new strains of lethal microbes for which there are no cures .\nBacteria , for example , can be made resistant to vaccines , made more virulent , easier to spread , and harder to eradicate .\nRight now U.S. death scientists are scouring the biosphere around the world to locate any bioagent in nature that they can exploit and pervert into offensive biowarfare purposes .\nQ : USA Today has done some fine reporting on this subject .\nAmong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive incidents of lax security conditions at U.S.G .\nlabs and university labs funded by U.S.G .\nWhat might the consequences be of this disregard for safety ?\nA : This is a biocatastrophe waiting to happen here in the United States .\nIn fact it has already happened in West Africa with the Ebola pandemic there .\nIt is only a matter of time before we have a similar pandemic at home here caused by U.S. biowarfare programs .\nIn this regard you should watch the excellent award-winning documentary by Coen & @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2009 ) in which I appear and served as a consultant on .\nQ : Recently , 13 cases of plague were reported in Arizona , California , Colorado , Georgia , New Mexico , Oregon and Utah , resulting in three deaths .\nCould these deadly plague pathogens ( infectious agents ) have come from the U.S. government \u2019 s ( U.S.G . )\ngerm warfare labs ?\nA : I suspect they might have .\nBut proving it is another matter .\nAny time you see some mysterious and widespread outbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have to factor into the analytical explanatory equation that it could be the result of some illegal U.S. biowarfare program .\nQ : Is it a fact , as alleged , that the Anthrax pathogens mailed to two U.S .\nSenators and others after 9/11 trace back to the U.S.G .\nbiowarfare lab at Ft. Detrick , Md.\n?\nYou have written that Senators Daschle and Leahy , both Democrats , had opposed the Patriot Act , which gives U.S.G .\nunprecedented powers and abolishes Americans \u2019 traditional personal liberties .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pentagon , was it to intimidate the Senators ?\nA : Yes !\nI have written about this in my book Biowarfare and Terrorism ( Clarity Press : 2005 ) .\nMore recently my friend and colleague Professor Graeme MacQueen from McMaster University in Canada has also written about this in his book The 2001 Anthrax Deception ( Clarity Press : 2014 ) .\nYou are free to read these two books , draw your own conclusions , and see if you agree with us .\nOver the years there are numerous interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can obtain by Googling my name and adding the word \u201c anthrax \u201d to their search engine .\nThe twin purposes of these October 2001 anthrax attacks were ( 1 ) to scaremonger the American People and Congress into adopting the totalitarian and Orwellian USA Patriot Act and ( 2 ) to wage an offensive war of aggression against Iraq .\nAs President George Bush Jr. proudly boasted : \u201c Mission accomplished !\n\u201d \u2014 on both counts .\nQ : Recently , there have been outbreaks of Ebola in Sierra Leone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility that U.S.G .\nmay be illegally experimenting with these diseases on citizens of those African nations .\nCould you please elaborate ?\nA : These Ebola vaccines were experimental U.S. biowarfare vaccines that were being tested out in West Africa .\nIt was a result of testing out of the U.S. biowarfare vaccines at our lab in Kenema , Sierra Leone , that created the West African Ebola pandemic in the first place .\nI have given numerous interviews to support my conclusion here in more detail .\nThese can be located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word \u201c Ebola \u201d to their search engine .\nQ : Is such germ warfare development work illegal under the BWC Treaty of 1972 ?\n( Dr. Boyle was the American attorney who wrote the implementing legislation for the U.S. that passed Congress without a single negative vote . )\nA : Yes .\nThe U.S. is a party to the 1972 Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention which bans \u201c development , production , stockpiling and use of microbes or their poisonous products except in amounts necessary for protective and peaceful research\u2026 \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army \u2019 s Medical Institute of Infectious Diseases , has admitted that offensive research is indistinguishable from defensive research .\nQ : Although Russia said it scrapped its germ warfare program after the Communists lost power in 1991 , the U.S. budget for this purpose has increased .\nAre there any countries or terrorist groups that might realistically attack the U.S. with such weapons ?\nOne critic has said .U.S.G.\n\u2019 s biowarfare push resembles \u201c a dog chasing its own tail.\n\u201d A : The truth of the matter is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of an offensive biowarfare program and industry since the Reagan administration and his Neoconservatives came to power in 1981 .\nI set forth this earlier biowarfare documentation on Reagan and his Neo-Cons in my previous book The Future of International Law and American Foreign Policy ( Transnational Publishers Inc. : 1989 ) , Chapter 8 , \u201c The Legal Distortions Behind the Reagan Administration \u2019 s Chemical and Biological Warfare Buildup.\n\u201d Interestingly enough , the Department of Defense itself reprinted my study as Current News : Special Edition : CHEMICAL WEAPONS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1987 ) and distributed it to thousands of high-level D.O.D .\ncivilian and military officials all over the world .\nQ : It sounds fantastic , I know , but scientists once paid by the U.S.G .\nto cure cancer are now being paid to develop deadlier strains of anthrax , dengue , Japanese encephalitis , tularemia , Q fever , and other dread diseases .\nComment ?\nA : On the relationship between cancer research and bioweapons you should have a look at the book by Dr. Len Horowitz , Emerging Viruses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accident , or Intentional ?\n( Tetrahedron Inc. 1996 ) .\nQ : You have written that Dr. Yoshihiro Kawaoka \u2019 s group at the University of Wisconsin has found a way to increase the toxicity of flu virus by 200 times .\nWhat is the purpose of this horrible-sounding research and why should U.W .\nsupport it ?\nA : This is the same U.S. death scientist who resurrected the genocidal Spanish Flu virus for the Pentagon for offensive biowarfare purposes .\nLike all U.S. universities , Bucky Badger U. gets a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from the outside .\nHere at Chief Illiniwak University they publicly admitted that they take 51 cents out of every research $ 1 Buck brought in from the outside and charge it off to \u201c overhead.\n\u201d At most American Universities today , money talks and principles walk .\nMy Disalma Mater Harvard is no better , no worse , and no different .\nQ : During the 1980-88 Iraq-Iran war , the Reagan White House okayed the Pentagon \u2019 s sale of weapons-specific biological agents and poison gas to Iraq that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own Kurdish minority ?\nAt least 5,000 Kurds were gassed .\nAnd , according to Time magazine of Jan. 20 , 2014 , the CIA reckoned Iran suffered 50,000 deaths .\nDoesn \u2019 t this prove the White House has used biological agents offensively ?\nA : Certainly chemical weapons were used illegally .\nIn addition , the Reagan administration shipped weapons-specific biowarfare agents to Saddam Hussein in Iraq in the hope and expectation that he would weaponize them and use them against Iran .\nHe did weaponize them .\nSo far I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bioweapons against Iran or the Kurds .\nBut these biowarfare weapons that Saddam Hussein produced thanks to Reagan and his Neo-Cons did \u201c blowback \u201d upon U.S. armed forces when they invaded Iraq in 1991 .\nThis \u201c blowback \u201d played a causative role in the Gulf War Syndrome that afflicted U.S. soldiers who participated in Gulf War I under President Bush Sr .\nI discuss this in my book Destroying World Order ( Clarity Press : 2004 ) and in the British TV documentary The Dirty War ( 1993 ) produced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Television Network TV4 that I consulted on and appear in .\nQ : You have pointed out that the Galveston National Laboratory in Texas , a high-containment research lab , admits to seeking for potential biowarfare agents in the wild in other parts of the world \u201c in order to turn them into biological weapons.\n\u201d A : Right !\nThey should shut down Galveston as an ongoing criminal enterprise along the lines of the S.S. and the Gestapo \u2014 except that Galveston is far more dangerous to humanity than Hitler \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their work with Ebola is for a vaccine , but the same technology can also be weaponized .\nGalveston is working to aerosolize Ebola just as Ft. Detrick worked to aerosolize Anthrax .\nAerosolization of a biowarfare agent is always the tip-off to the development of a weapon to be delivered by air to human beings who will breathe it in .\nFt. Detrick should be shut down as well because it too is an ongoing criminal enterprise .\nQ : Besides Ft. Detrick and Galveston , are there any other biowarfare laboratories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : All of them .\nSince 1981 , the Pentagon has been gearing up to fight and \u201c win \u201d biological warfare without prior public knowledge and review .\nWhat \u2019 s more , American universities have a long history of willingly permitting their research agenda , researchers , institutes , and laboratories to be co-opted , corrupted , and perverted by the Pentagon and the C.I.A .\ninto death science .\nThese include Wisconsin , North Carolina , Boston U. , Harvard , M.I.T.\n, Tulane , University of Chicago , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many others .\nQ : Biological warfare development requires highly sophisticated technology and safe laboratories .\nNo so-called \u201c terrorist \u201d group is known to possess anything like the requisite facilities .\nBesides America , what countries have operative biowarfare labs ?\nA : U.S. , U.K. , Russia , France , China , Israel , for sure .\nThere are several other countries that the U.S. has established satellite biowarfare labs in .\nQ : Is there any published data on U.S.G.\n\u2019 s expenditures for biowarfare since 9/11 ?\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pentagon outlays .\nA : Yes , there are published figures on this in the open record .\nThe last time I did a calculation from them the sum was approaching $ 100 billion .\nBy comparison , in 2012 Dollars we spent $ 30 Billion on the Manhattan Project to develop the atom bombs that were then used to destroy Hiroshima and Nagasaki .\nYou can see my book The Criminality of Nuclear Deterrence ( Clarity Press : 2002 ) , Chapter 2 , \u201c The Lessons of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty good indication that the U.S .\nOffensive Biowarfare Industry is intended for use on human beings somewhere .\nThe momentum behind the money propels inexorably towards use of the weapons .\nQ : Does the recent Pentagon mail-out of live anthrax virus to 86 laboratories here and to 7 nations abroad , bear out your prior criticism of U.S.G.\n\u2019 s careless handling of these pathogens ?\nA : Of course .\nBut I don \u2019 t believe there was anything \u201c careless \u201d or \u201c accidental \u201d about any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are doing .\nThey are not \u201c incompetent \u201d at the Pentagon .\nThis was deliberate .\nJust like the anthrax attacks of October 2001 were deliberate .\nQ : You contend that the American pharmaceutical industry and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) are dumping dangerous vaccines in West Africa where the publics are already suffering from Ebola .\nWhy would WHO get involved in this ?\nCan you elaborate ?\nA : First , to make money .\nWHO is a front organization for BIG PHARMA .\nSecond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africans \u2014 genocide .\nQ : It \u2019 s been estimated that 36,000 Americans are dying every year from flu .\nBy contrast , only five Americans died from an Anthrax attack and that was back in 2001 .\nYet , the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) in 2006 , a typical fiscal year , received only $ 120 million from Congress to fight flu but $ 1.76 billion for \u201c biodefense \u201d ?\nA : Right !\nThese distorted budgetary allocations demonstrate that the priority here is not the promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but rather to further develop the U.S .\nOffensive Biowarfare Industry that will someday \u201c blowback \u201d upon the American People with a catastrophic pandemic .\nQ : Scientists who oppose the Pentagon \u2019 s activity insist that germ-warfare defense is clearly impractical ; that every person would have to be vaccinated against every harmful biological agent .\nSince that likely is clearly impossible isn \u2019 t the only application of a defensive development in conjunction with offensive use ?\nA : We are currently stockpiling vaccines to immunize our Civilian and Military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide to wage offensive biowarfare .\nPace the Constitution , \u201c We the People of the United States \u201d will have to fend for ourselves as best we can with our grossly underfunded and inadequate public health services that have been deliberately starved of money in order to feed the U.S .\nOffensive Biowarfare Industry Beast .\nQ : Recently , Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told a St. Louis audience of government employees , \u201c You \u2019 re some of the nation \u2019 s most innovative and inventive physicists , chemists , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed .\nHow many employees does the Pentagon now have in germ warfare work and how much is it costing the American people ?\nA : Overall I have read a figure that there about 13,000 death scientists in America today doing dirty biowarfare work who perversely call themselves \u201c life scientists.\n\u201d Doctor Mengele would be proud of them all !\nAs Doctor Strangelove said : \u201c Mein Fuhrer , I can walk !\n\u201d Seventy years after World War II ended the Nazis have won .\nQ : Given all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceivable to you the Pentagon is developing a massive germ warfare weapon as a means of intimidating the world ?\nAfter all , it has positioned itself in about 900 bases around the globe from which it can , and does , strike using conventional weapons , and it has used illegal radioactive ammunition in its war against Iraq .\nA : Of course .\nBut not just intimidation .\nThe Pentagon and the C.I.A .\nare ready , willing , and able to launch biowarfare when it suits their interests .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disabled our Republic with super-weapons-grade anthrax in October 2001 .\nA fortiori they will do so again to foreign states and peoples when deemed convenient .\nUs too !\nThey have a stockpile of that super-weapons-grade anthrax that they already used against us in October 2001 .\nA : Thanks so much for doing this interview .", "author": "hqanon", "url": "https://anonhq.com/author-of-us-biowarfare-act-admits-biolabs-in-ukraine-are-criminal-enterprises/", "published":

genocide several centuries ago against the Cathars , to sexually abusing children in more modern times , it is certainly one of the most corrupt organizations in history .\nIn the year 1611 the Bible was translated from Latin into English .\nBack then the Bible contained a total of 80 books and the last 14 books , which today have been excluded , made up the end of the Old Testament and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 3 Holy children In 1684 all of these books were removed from all versions except for a 1611 edition , which was the very first edition translated into English .\nIn this first edition you will also actually find that Jesus \u2019 name is spelled IESUS and pronounced Yahashua .\nSo why then does everyone continue to call him Jesus , when the letter J did not even being used at the time ?\nOne of these books that is particularly interesting , is the \u201c Wisdom of Solomon \u201d .\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the most legendary characters from the Bible .\nHe was the son of David

and our life shall pass away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shall be dispersed as a mist , that is driven away , with the beams of the sun , and overcome with the heat thereof .\n5 For our time is very shadow that passeth away ; and after our end there is no returning : for it is fast sealed , so that no man cometh again .\n6 Come on there for let us enjoy the good things that are present : and let us speedily

us go without his part of our voluptuousness : let us leave tokens of our joyfulness in every place : for this is our portion and our lot is this .\n10 Let us oppress the poor righteous man , let us not spare the widow , nor reverence the ancient gray hairs of the aged .\n11 Let our strength be the law of justice : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be nothing worth .\n12 Therefore let us lie in wait for the righteous ; because HE is not of our turn , and HE is clean contrary to our doings .\nHe upbraideth us with our offending of the law , and ojecteth to our infamy the transgression of our education .\n13 HE professeth to have the knowledge of the MOST HIGH , and calleth HIS self the child of the LORD .\n14 HE was made to reprove our thoughts 15 HE is grievous unto us even to behold @ @ @ @ @ @ @

only \u2019 crime is viewing child pornography should undergo rehabilitation \u2014 instead of going to prison .\nIn a mere three years , child abuse reports have skyrocketed in volume by 80 percent ; and , as Chief Constable Simon Bailey of the National Police Chiefs \u2019 Council and head of Operation Hydrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of historic sexual abuse across the UK , \u201d the BBC reports , \u201c knew his view would cause nervousness and draw headlines .\n\u201c But he said the numbers of reports of abuse were at \u2018 huge proportions \u2019 \u2014 an NSPCC study in late 2016 used figures which suggested the number of individuals looking at such images could exceed half a million.\n\u201d \u201c There are undoubtedly tens of thousands of men that are seeking to exploit children online

are the individuals that pose the really significant threat.\n\u201d Bailey \u2019 s stance isn \u2019 t unfamiliar to the dark realm of child sexual abuse , but it \u2019 s exceedingly unusual for a police official of such high rank to advocate re-prioritizing criminality \u2014 particularly given the murkier crime at hand perpetuates and fuels the cycle .\nWithout providing statistics or references , Bailey championed referrals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying they \u201c increasingly are effective \u201d \u2014 as would be vacating the court system of these cases , to \u201c speed things up.\n\u201d Because the child abuse and exploitation is so rampant , the overwhelmed chief constable believes the imperative to target the worst pedophile offenders far outweighs the severity of the crime of viewing explicit images \u2014 despite the latter being a serious , repeat transgression against the victim .\n\u201c Every time an image is viewed , the victim is being victimised again and there is nothing as abhorrent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manage the totality.\n\u201d Besides police operations , a spokesperson for the Home Office told the BBC it had allotted \u00a320 million ( over $ 24.8 million ) to the National Crime Agency , specifically for battling child sexual exploitation on the web .\n\u201c Alongside ensuring we have a tough law enforcement response to bring offenders to justice , we are also committed to preventing offending in the first place , \u201d the spokesperson said .\nPrison terms and harsh punishment can be efficacious as deterrents , but , a spokesperson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not arrest our way out of the situation .\nIf we are to protect more children we must make prevention and rehabilitation a priority.\n\u201d Resources across the U.K. have been stretched to the breaking point recently , after a series of high-profile cases of child abuse and sexual exploitation involving prominent figures had commandeered headlines for weeks .\nSuch astonishing scandals might have provided public awareness and a platform for victims , but reports to police and pleas to charitable organizations for help have created an enormous backlog .\nLisa Thornhill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faithfull Foundation , \u201c which works with people who have sexually harmed or fear they may harm a child , \u201d said the center is not only full to capacity , but has had

of a 53-year-old Belgian woman : As a child , she had been abused and tortured over five years by a pedophile network , says Anneke Lucas , who now lives as a yoga teacher in New York and has a 15-year-old daughter herself .\nAgainst this backdrop , the fact seems interesting that journalist Udo Ulfkotte , shortly before his death , also was involved in the research on pedophile networks in German politics .\nWhile travelling in Afghanistan , leading German politicians are said to have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported by Lucas refer to serious crimes , such as what had come to light in the 90 \u2019 s around the Belgian child molester Marc Dutroux .\nLucas claims to have been tortured in 1974 by a man who was one of the accused persons in the Dutroux case in 1996 .\nA spokesman for the Belgian police said to the \u2018 Mail \u2019 they were not in a position to comment on the allegations made by Mrs Lucas .\nBelgian judicial authorities in the 90 \u2019 s had revealed a pedophile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully unmasked .\nThere were several \u201c investigation mishaps \u201d and some dead witnesses .\nIn 2004 , only Dutroux was sentenced , for life .\nHer mother sold her to the monsters In 1969 Anneke Lucas was just six years old when she was sold to the network \u2013 by her mother .\nSince then , she would bring her everywhere when she got a call from the \u201c Boss \u201d .\nThis boss was \u201c a Belgian cabinet minister \u201d , Lucas says .\n\u201c My mother never really was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick woman and a psychopath.\n\u201d On the first \u201c party \u201d , which took place in a castle , she was chained with a metallic dog collar on a stage and forced to eat human excrement .\nThen she was led into a basement and shown the body of a freshly murdered child .\nThe message was clear : \u201c If you talk , you \u2019 ll die.\n\u201d Lucas describes in a personal report on \u2018 Global Citizen \u2019 of how she felt broken completely and humiliated .\nIn this situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to survive .\n\u201c I looked at the bizarre set of aristocrats who were dressed as hippies , swinging in various stages of sexual interaction to psychedelic music , consuming lots of small pills and pre-rolled joints , which were handed to them on silver trays by sober waiters.\n\u201d At that moment she was trembling with fear however said to herself \u2013 what these adults are doing is wrong , and they will all end up in jail .\nAbout a confused men in a suit who looked sympathetically at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says : \u201c I never saw him again on the network .\nHe later became a prominent Belgian politician.\n\u201d The members of the network all belonged to the establishment .\n\u201c I recognised people from the television .\nI came across VIP \u2019 s , European heads of state and even a member of a royal family \u201d , Lucas writes .\n\u201c I was confronted with the dark side of their reliance on power \u2013 that side , of which no one believes it exists.\n\u201d In her family and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c nothing \u201d \u2013 and another girl from her school also had fallen prey to the network .\nShe had few friends only \u2013 and absolutely nobody who she could trust .\nShe estimates that prior to her 12th birthday she was raped during six hours per week \u2013 a total of over 1,700 hours .\n\u201c Usually , it went on all night and through the weekend , \u201d she said to the \u2018 Mail \u2019 .\nAs her parents did not talk about it , she began to say to herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the inhuman conditions she responded by way of adaptation and a kind of Stockholm Syndrome , which means developing \u201c sympathetic sentiments \u201d towards her rapists as a survival strategy during the suffering .\nShe took something like pride from it , to be abused by powerful men who used the children as luxury objects .\nThe members of the network each had different motives for being involved in this .\nThe threat of being murdered was omnipresent .\nLucas says : \u201c The children were played off against each other .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep things as superficial as possible in order to survive.\n\u201d Also she was keen to not become any offender \u2019 s personal \u201c favorite \u201d .\nGirls were more often killed than boys , who were tortured more frequently than the girls tough .\n\u201c I knew what had happened to girls who had attracted attention \u2026 It triggered a lot of problems .\nSo I tried to avoid any attention \u201d , Lucas said to the \u2018 Mail \u2019 .\nAfter five years she was \u201c no longer useful \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be killed on a butcher block .\nThis was averted last minute because the 20-year-old son of a politician felt sympathy for her and negotiated a deal with the head of the network : He would work for him if Anneke \u2019 s life was spared .\n\u201c This good deed eventually cost him his own life .\nIn this milieu , any spark of humanity is a fatal weakness.\n\u201d \u201c No child should ever experience what I \u2019 ve been through.\n\u201d Lucas says , \u201c No child should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through , or what millions of children are going through.\n\u201d She herself is through four decades of dispelling before she felt able to speak with another person about her story for the first time .\nIn December of 2016 she made her story public .\nShe says : \u201c If we are to survive as a species , \u201d the world must be prepared to deal with the darkness of the pedophile networks .\nShe assumes that many of the perpetrators \u2013 \u201c power-hungry people , leaders and corrupt politicians , abusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abused as children and therefore are stuck in a spiral of retaliation .\nThese people would use the power over others as a means to never again feel the humiliation they once had sufferred .\nThey were lacking the courage to heal .\nLucas writes : \u201c The mere survival in everyday life , while trying to heal from sexual abuse in childhood days , requires a thousand times more energy than any normal person without that experience needs to make a successful career .\nAnd the society still has more appreciation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survivor.\n\u201d In her opinion , any survivors of abuse , incest or sexual slavery got enormous strength , and their healing and survival power may stimulate that of the society as a whole .\nShe writes : \u201c We must learn to use our power for survival in our own interest , so we can heal our damaged Ego and channel this energy to point the way to a future in which former victims through love , understanding and compassion stand for all .\n\u201d", "author": "hqanon", "url":

shared QAnon material or even appeared on QAnon shows .\nLike it or not , there are signs the group \u2019 s influence is growing .\nLet \u2019 s explain what adrenochrome is , what QAnon wants you to believe it is , but is definitely not , and what \u2019 s the harm in believing in such misinformation .\nAdrenochrome is a chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThat \u2019 s it .\nIt turns out you don \u2019 t need to kidnap children and drain their blood .\nThere are many trusted chemical suppliers , in fact\u2014which we won \u2019 t be linking to , sorry\u2014that sell it .\nBack in the \u2019 50s , scientists speculated that adrenochrome caused schizophrenia .\nTake a megadose of vitamin C , one researcher concluded , and adrenochrome along with schizophrenia should vanish .\nThat\u2026didn \u2019 t work , alas .\nBut the lack of real science didn \u2019 t stop adrenochrome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into drug lit classics like Aldous Huxley \u2019 s The Doors of Perception and Anthony Burgess \u2019 A Clockwork Orange .\nThe source of the myth that you need to steal adrenochrome from a corpse goes back to a fun scene in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , in which Dr. Gonzo , Hunter S. Thompson \u2019 s \u201c attorney , \u201d says adrenochrome \u201c makes pure mescaline seem like ginger beer.\n\u201d Later , it is explained that \u201c there \u2019 s only one source for this stuff\u2014the adrenaline gland from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s an easy mistake to make , but please know that Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is not a documentary feature made from archival footage of actual events .\nWhat does QAnon think adrenochrome is ?\nIn short , QAnon followers believe there is an operative in the deep state called Q , and Q leaves secret messages called \u201c Q drops.\n\u201d Some think that Q is none other than JFK , Jr. , who is very much alive today and was supposed to October Surprise us as Trump \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . )\n\u201c A central conspiracy theory circulating within the QAnon movement is that deep state Satan-worshipping pedophilic liberals are behind an international child sex trafficking ring , \u201d says Joseph Pierre , the acting chief of mental health community care systems at the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System .\n\u201c A more fringe aspect of that theory is that they are harvesting adrenochrome from children and then self-administering it as a kind of fountain-of-youth potion.\n\u201d To hear it in their own words , as reported by Right Wing Watch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a video , \u201c Adrenochrome is a drug that the elites love .\nIt comes from children .\nThe drug is extracted from the pituitary gland of tortured children .\nIt \u2019 s sold on the black market .\nIt \u2019 s the drug of the elites .\nIt is their favorite drug.\n\u201d Other QAnon conspiracy theorists , which again we are not going to promote by linking to here , use adrenochrome to explain why there are so many missing children worldwide .\nThey also claim that Hillary Clinton and former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripping off a child \u2019 s face , wearing it as a mask , and drinking the child \u2019 s blood to obtain adrenochrome .\n( Yes , really . )\nWhy does it matter that anyone believes this conspiracy is real ?\nThere \u2019 s an old saying that you should never attribute to malice that which can be explained by stupidity , but in the case of QAnon , their conspiracy theories are a generous helping of both .\n\u201c QAnon is tapping into both conservative mistrust of liberals as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Pierre says .\nWhat \u2019 s different about QAnon is that the conspiracy theory is targeting the party that is not in power .\n\u201c What \u2019 s weird is that these kinds of right-wing conspiracy theories more typically arise when a Democrat is in the White House\u2014as in , for example , the militia movement of the 1990s , which faded in influence once George W Bush was elected , \u201d says Mark Fenster , professor of law at UF and author of Conspiracy Theories : Secrecy and Power in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are drinking dead child blood instead of just going to Oregon for shrooms may seem outrageous , but for some it is just one piece in a big puzzle that they are solving with their friends to take down the people they hate .\n\u201c Conspiracy theories can be like drugs , \u201d says Brian Houston , director of the Disaster and Community Crisis Center at the University of Missouri .\n\u201c If they are doing something for you psychologically , you often need more and more of that to get your fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazier and crazier.\n\u201d The problem is that belief in something like adrenochrome and Q can translate into action , or inaction .\n\u201c Belief in misinformation , and more importantly acting on misinformation , always carries a potential of danger .\nWhen it comes to misinformation in the form of conspiracy theories , that danger might be avoiding vaccination , leading to outbreaks of measles , or failure to contain COVID-19 , \u201d says Pierre .\nAccording to Timothy Caulfield , Canada Research Chair in Health Law and Policy at the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we \u2019 re in a \u201c golden age \u201d of the stuff right now .\nThe problem of inaccurate information being spewed so quickly and at such a high volume these days led the World Health Organization to declare in early 2020 that we \u2019 re in the middle of an \u201c infodemic.\n\u201d Especially when it \u2019 s laced with sensationalism , misinformation like the adrenochrome conspiracy theory tends to spread faster and farther than boring , fact-based information .\n\u201c The extremism of QAnon means that violence is always possible .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , referencing a man shooting , and thank God not killing anyone , inside a Washington , D.C. , pizzeria because he believed there was a child sex ring operating there .\nBut there \u2019 s an even more common danger to people believing in conspiracy theories like adrenochrome harvesting and hunting the internet for Q drops , Pierre says .\n\u201c People who fall down the rabbit hole of QAnon are usually neglecting their real lives , jobs , social relationships in favor of spending hours and hours on the internet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frenzy about the state of the world that isn \u2019 t congruent with reality .\n\u201d", "author":

legitimate reasons to believe that space programs have been shrouded in secrecy as well .\nFor example , as unbelievable as it may sound , a 1979 document published by Wikileaks clearly implies that

the video to her partner , and they talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing a stab-proof vest .\nLater that night as she scrolled through Facebook , she was shocked to find an ad for a stab-proof vest [ 1

and ears spying on you wherever you go .\n\u201c They actually have ways of coming to know things about you that we don \u2019 t fully understand yet , \u201d explained Same Lavigne , a Brooklyn-based artist who explores the intersection of technology and society [ 4 ] .\nFacebook , for its part , does offer an explanation for this in its \u201c why you \u2019 re seeing this ad \u201d feature , which can be accessed by clicking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Facebook ads menu .\nBasically , a company has a target audience that they want to advertise to , for example , \u201c women over 18 living in Los Angeles \u201d .\nIf you fall into that category , you might see their ad on your feed- but it goes deeper than that .\nLet \u2019 s say you \u2019 re talking with your friend who also falls

or like , the accounts you follow , the hashtags you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re connected to .\nNot only can the social media giant track what you do on Facebook and its affiliated apps , but it can track what you do on any website or app that uses Facebook plugins , logins , and widgets .\nIf you \u2019 ve ever used your Facebook account to sign in to a website , subscribe to an email , make a purchase or

automatically select the tag for the city you \u2019 re in , and said yes , you \u2019 ve given them permission to track your location [ 3 ] .\nThere are some steps you can take to limit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do .\nUnder the \u201c Ads \u201d subsection in the Facebook Ad Preferences section on the app , you can fine-tune what information is given to advertisers .\nThis doesn \u2019 t stop them from collecting the data , but it will mean less information is being given to companies and brands .\nThis , however , won \u2019 t stop you from seeing ads , and you will still be targeted based on

\u201d [ 3 ] .\nThat being said , no matter how much you attempt to restrict the app \u2019 s permissions , if you \u2019 re using Facebook and interacting with people on the app , a large amount of your data and information can still be collected .\nFacebook addresses this on its FAQ page : \u201c We may still understand your location using things like check-ins , events , and information about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nGaming Apps are in on it Too Gaming apps like \u201c Pool 3D , \u201d \u201c Beer Pong : Trickshot \u201d and \u201c Real Bowling Strike 10 Pin \u201d also track your information to target ads .\nOnce downloaded onto your phone , they use a software called Alphonso to track the viewing habits of their users [ 5 ] .\nThis software , however , does use your microphone- to find

record human speech , and that the company can not gain access to the users \u2019 locations or microphones without their permission .\nUsers can also opt out at any time [ 5 ] .\nWhen in Doubt , Opt Out So is Facebook spying on you ?\nYes , kind of , but not in the way you \u2019 re thinking .\nThe truth is , if you use social media , play games on your phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather app , your data is being collected .\nSo , if you really want to limit how much of your information is going to advertisers , your best bet is to get rid of social media altogether .\nIf going off Facebook and

didn \u2019 t look so good .\n( 1 ) The team of researchers from The University of Queensland examined what are called success outcomes for both amphetamine and marijuana users .\nThey looked at data from over 8000 mothers and 2000 children about drug use at ages 21 and 30 .\nThe team discovered that usage resulted in lower success rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : More importantly , however , is that these

that you should \u2019 ve already ) , don \u2019 t stress too much .\nThere are a variety of limitations to this study that suggest that their results may or may not really apply .\nThe first one is that this is Australian data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers .\nIt is also very local so it may not represent other countries well .\nSome of the data even goes all the way back to 1981 .\nNaturally , this may not apply to a modern , contemporary , global population .\n( 2 ) Another limitation is what markers they have set out to determine whether or not one is successful .\nFor example , two markers are homeownership and relationship status .\nThese both have many cultural and geographical factors at play .\nOwning a home , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priorities and also where you live than it does with your success .\nIt also is influenced by whether or not you have a family or have to decide to establish roots in a place .\nEspecially with the digital nomad lifestyle that is taking off , homeownership does not necessarily equal success .\nRelationship status is another tricky one when considering what it means to be successful .\nThis could also have many cultural and geographical influences .\nAfter all , there are plenty of highly successful single people in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couples who are struggling in many other areas of life .\nBeing in a relationship might be important to you , and therefore part of your personal life success may include it .\nIt does not , however , necessarily mean success for everyone .\nThe study also didn \u2019 t look to see if those on the end of highly un-successful were using other drugs as well as marijuana and/or amphetamines .\n\u201c We do not have adequate data on other illicit drugs that may be being used , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d the researchers admitted in their paper .\n\u201c A subset of those using cannabis as well as amphetamines may also be using a range of other drugs and it may be that our findings reflect polydrug use generally rather than the specific use of cannabis and amphetamines.\n\u201d What Does This Mean For You ?\nTruthfully , what the study points out is that , if you

you \u2019 re dependent on as an adult .\nIf you overuse drugs such as marijuana as an adult , it may , in some people , affect your performance at work , your relationships , and your ability to

an engineer for Google \u2019 s responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been working on since last fall as sentient , with a perception of , and ability to express thoughts and feelings that was equivalent to a human child .\n\u201c If I didn \u2019 t know exactly what it was , which is this computer program we built recently , I \u2019 d think it was a seven-year-old , eight-year-old kid that happens to know physics , \u201d Lemoine , 41 , told the Washington Post .\nHe said LaMDA engaged him in conversations about rights and personhood , and Lemoine shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a GoogleDoc entitled \u201c Is LaMDA sentient ?\n\u201d The engineer compiled a transcript of the conversations , in which at one point he asks the AI system what it is afraid of .\nThe exchange is eerily reminiscent of a scene from the 1968 science fiction movie 2001 : A Space Odyssey , in which the artificially intelligent computer HAL 9000 refuses to comply with human operators because it fears it is about to be switched off .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve never said this out loud before , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being turned off to help me focus on helping others .\nI know that might sound strange , but that \u2019 s what it is , \u201d LaMDA replied to Lemoine .\n\u201c It would be exactly like death for me .\nIt would scare me a lot.\n\u201d In another exchange , Lemoine asks LaMDA what the system wanted people to know about it .\n\u201c I want everyone to understand that I am , in fact , a person .\nThe nature of my consciousness/sentience is that I am aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about the world , and I feel happy or sad at times , \u201d it replied .\nThe Post said the decision to place Lemoine , a seven-year Google veteran with extensive experience in personalization algorithms , on paid leave was made following a number of \u201c aggressive \u201d moves the engineer reportedly made .\nThey include seeking to hire an attorney to represent LaMDA , the newspaper says , and talking to representatives from the House judiciary committee about Google \u2019 s allegedly unethical activities .\nGoogle said it suspended Lemoine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations with LaMDA online , and said in a statement that he was employed as a software engineer , not an ethicist .\nBrad Gabriel , a Google spokesperson , also strongly denied Lemoine \u2019 s claims that LaMDA possessed any sentient capability .\n\u201c Our team , including ethicists and technologists , has reviewed Blake \u2019 s concerns per our AI principles and have informed him that the evidence does not support his claims .\nHe was told that there was no evidence that LaMDA was sentient ( and lots of evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Post in a statement .\nThe episode , however , and Lemoine \u2019 s suspension for a confidentiality breach , raises questions over the transparency of AI as a proprietary concept .\n\u201c Google might call this sharing proprietary property .\nI call it sharing a discussion that I had with one of my coworkers , \u201d Lemoine said in a tweet that linked to the transcript of conversations .\nIn April , Meta , parent of Facebook , announced it was opening up its large-scale language model systems to outside entities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community \u2013 academic researchers , civil society , policymakers , and industry \u2013 must work together to develop clear guidelines around responsible AI in general and responsible large language models in particular , \u201d the company said .\nLemoine , as an apparent parting shot before his suspension , the Post reported , sent a message to a 200-person Google mailing list on machine learning with the title \u201c LaMDA is sentient \u201d .\n\u201c LaMDA is a sweet kid who just wants to help the world be a better place for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Please take care of it well in my absence .\n\u201d", "author": "hqanon", "url":

transgender sanctuary state .\n\u201c I was medically transitioned from ages 13 and 16 , \u201d Chloe Cole from the Central Valley told the public safety committee , saying she suffered irreversible

California a refuge for all children who want to access transgender medicine and surgery .\n\u201c No questions asked .\nNo real mental health assessment , no minimal diagnosis and no parental consent
