private funding of the election processes in the various states , thus allowing partisans like Mark Zuckerberg to choose the umpires to supervise elections .\nSince the Democratic majority in the Senate is based on the voter fraud that enabled the election of Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock in the 2020 runoff , the Democrats are essentially ratifying the cheating that allowed them to win the Senate and then using that skullduggery to stop enforcement of integrity safeguards in all other elections .\nWhat are Republicans to do in the face of this blatant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember that the best defense against voter fraud is a landslide .\nWe need to win by a margin sufficient to defeat their phony votes and their cheating .\nIt looks like Biden is up to the task of so destroying our

.\nAnd we can do it .\nWe are on track to win the House and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House by at least sixty seats and will win the Senate by 55-45 .\nWe will likely defeat incumbent Democrats Raphael

back the program .\nOn his support for the filibuster , the West Virginia Democrat is also on solid ground politically .\nBy 67-26 his constituents agree with his position .\nSo why doesn \u2019 t

Biden that no other Democrat is willing to pursue .\nWith the rest of the Party and the hopefuls for 2024 reluctant to turn on Biden and afraid to confront the extreme left , Hillary is becoming the sole source supplier of such a position .\nShe recognizes that no other prominent Democrat will be willing to take on the left because they all frightened of it .\nWhether they are senators and governors who will have to pass through primary elections to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must win primaries to get the \u2019 24 nomination , they all recognize that becoming the anti-left candidate is a recipe for disaster .\nBut Hillary has no such fears .\nShe doesn \u2019 t have to win any election or any primary for the next year or two .\nAnd she realizes that as the dismal failure of the Biden presidency becomes apparent even to progressive true believers , Biden bashers and critics of the tactics and views of the extreme left will come out of the woodwork .\nShe gets it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a growth industry .\nBiden will be protected from Democratic criticism until the 2022 elections .\nDemocrats will continue to rally to his side to salvage what they can from the coming midterm debacle .\nBut once Biden leads the Democratic Party into the crushing defeat of losing both houses by good margins , the party will open fire on him .\nAnd Harris will be one of the casualties .\nA consensus will develop \u2014 as it is already doing so in private \u2014 that Biden must go .\nInitially , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcing that he will only serve one term .\nBut , as the country descends into leaderless inflation and then recession , the need for more drastic steps will come into focus .\nBut until November 2022 , Hillary Clinton will be out there warning of the coming disaster and summoning moderates or disillusioned leftists to her banner .\nNobody else will dare to walk where she treads .\nPete Buttigieg can \u2019 t because he is in the Administration charged with doling out goodies from the various spending plans .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and puts him in a position to collect IOUs to win the \u2019 24 nomination .\nNo black candidate can follow suit because they all must strongly support the extreme left .\nAnd the Progressives like AOC may criticize Biden for incompetence , timidity or failure to deliver but they can \u2019 t follow Hillary \u2019 s critique of the defects of their underlying positions and programs .\nKnocking the left will be Hillary \u2019 s schtick and she will amass followers each day .\nThe Left will have no place left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly embrace Hillary \u2019 s critique of the left and put aside their ideology to support Hillary \u2019 s view .\nEven their personal distaste for her will take a backseat to the obvious need for the party to change direction to avert its destruction .\nIts the perfect play for her .\nHer entire political career is based on one fundamental proposition : That she is too unpopular and unlikable , and her record too compromised to be elected on her own merit .\nSo , she always advances masked in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She \u2019 s showing courage in the face of marital scandal .\nShe \u2019 s the first woman to run for president .\nShe stands on Bill \u2019 s impressive record of achievement .\nShe is standing up and fighting for Obama , even having once run against him .\nNow she \u2019 ll advance under a covering barrage against the nutty Democratic left .\nNot its goals or programs ( that would get her in trouble ) but against their tactics and lack of pragmatism .\nObviously , I know the Clintons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough nor sufficiently flexible to invent this play .\nBut Bill is .\nAnd , with him recovered from Monica enough to assert command in Hillary \u2019 s orbit , don \u2019 t discount how far he could go even with this flawed product .\nSUBSCRIBE TO RECEIVE DICK \u2019 S VIDEOS & COLUMNS FOR FREE \u2014 CLICK HERE !\nView Dick \u2019 s most recent

"The New Useful Idiots Many conservatives these days are channeling Neville Chamberlain , the former UK Prime Minister whose failure to stand up to Hitler helped bring on World War II , often recycling the arguments for appeasement that he used to undermine British preparedness and hasten Nazi aggression .\nParticularly among conservative cable commentators , the legacy of Ronald Reagan is being trashed by a new kind of isolationism .\nLargely spearheaded by Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson , the case for letting Putin help himself to Ukraine is growing , shattering the national security consensus that has dominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , the modern \u201c useful idiots \u201d that have always enabled authoritarian regimes to sap the will and resolve of defenders of freedom are hard at work .\nHere \u2019 s what they are saying : 1 .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not our fight.\n\u201d This chyron , recently displayed on the TV screens of America , even on conservative news channels , is as misleading as it is dangerous .\nDid not Pearl Harbor and 9/11 teach us anything ?\nCan any true conservative maintain that when Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tens of millions of people , taking away their freedom , that this is somehow \u201c not our fight ?\n\u201d Whether the challenge comes in Ukraine or in Taiwan , the battle is the same and the imperative for free nations to unite and stand up to repression is the same .\nThe fifty million people whose human freedoms are in peril in Ukraine and the twenty-three million at risk in Taiwan do not want to fall under the sway of Moscow or Beijing and the US must stand with them .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ want another war.\n\u201d No sane person can possibly advocate that the US battle Russian troops on their own border six thousand miles away .\nBut those who cower before that specter are knowingly misleading us .\nNobody is proposing anything of the sort .\nEconomic sanctions and a US oil embargo against Russian petroleum and gas would be a significant blow to their economy .\nRussia sells the US about 25,000 barrels per month , making it the third largest source of foreign oil after Canada and Mexico .\nCancelling the Nord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Germany foreign ministry and the EU ( but not by Biden ) would be the most effective thing we can do .\n3 .\n\u201c Putin is right.\n\u201d Some apologists for Putin even say that he is right to fear Ukrainian membership in NATO and liken it to what we would say if Mexico allied with Russia .\nBut the comparison is specious .\nNATO is a purely defensive alliance , obliging its members to fight only if one of their number is invaded .\nWe are not planning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never come into play .\nRemember that when Hitler marched into the Rhineland , shattering the Treaty of Versailles , Lord Lothian , the appeasement-minded UK ambassador to the US said that he had merely walked into \u201c his own backyard.\n\u201d Soon he was marching into France .\n4 .\n\u201c Russia just wants to extend its sphere of influence.\n\u201d To the diplomat , the Russian threat to Ukraine is a move on a global chessboard .\nBut to fifty million freedom-loving Christians , it is a very personal threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be extinguished .\n5 .\n\u201c Why worry about the Ukraine border when our own is being violated ?\n\u201d The argument that domestic priorities can blind us to a major erosion of American power is an old one , usually parroted by the left .\nBut now conservatives have taken up the chorus .\nDefending global freedom and securing our own borders are hardly mutually exclusive .\n6 .\n\u201c We must not be the policeman of the world \u201d .\nYes , but we do have to defend our vital national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggression is paramount .\nGet

completely off the rails .\nOne could dismiss an eccentric view here or there from any host .\nBut as war now rages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Vladmir Putin is coming true , Fox \u2019 s top host is doubling down on his own support of the Russian dictator .\nAnd he is making claims that are patently false .\nAs I have written before , Carlson is smarter than this .\nI don \u2019 t know his motive , but I do know it \u2019 s a problem that he is seeking to win over normally sane rational Fox News viewers , and by osmosis , some Newsmax viewers .\nThis week as Russian tanks poured into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I call them \u201c takeaway \u201d provinces ) , Carlson used his powerful prime time perch to attack any defense of the democratic nation of Ukraine , and to claim he himself was a victim of the left .\nCarlson said , \u201c The very same politicians who claim the United States is systemically racist , a white supremacist hellscape , defined by slavery , in other words an evil nation .\nThose people are always the first to claim that you hate America if you dare to disagree with them.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting the stage for him to attack U.S. policy in support of Ukraine , and paint anyone who criticizes him as part of the looney left .\n\u201c For months , we have criticized Joe Biden \u2019 s lunatic push for war with Russia , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Nothing about that makes sense .\nIt \u2019 s not foreign policy ; it \u2019 s self-harm , and it \u2019 s a lie.\n\u201d Biden \u2019 s push for war ?\nBiden is an incompetent and nincompoop , no doubt .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war with Russia .\nPutin has been lusting after a war in Ukraine .\nIt is Vladmir Putin who saw with his own eyes Biden \u2019 s weakness , first in Afghanistan , and then in these opening salvos of Russia \u2019 s move against Ukraine .\n\u201c Russia is not America \u2019 s greatest international rival , \u201d as Tucker claims , by every measure that is of course China.\n\u201d Russia , not China , controls the world \u2019 s largest nuclear arsenal , not China and not even the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States .\nChina is an emerging threat , and a dangerous one .\nAnd we should take steps to prepare against it .\nBut Russia , as Putin \u2019 s recent actions show , is an immediate threat to the United States and our allies .\nBut then Tucker claims , \u201c Ukraine is not our vital ally .\nWe have no legal or moral obligation to defend Ukraine \u2019 s territorial integrity even as we surrender our own to the rest of the world , letting millions in in a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy , despite what Joe Biden endlessly claims .\nUkraine is a corrupt eastern European autocracy that has spent millions of dollars lobbying politicians in Washington , and by the way made Joe Biden \u2019 s family rich .\nThose are not Russian talking points.\n\u201d Well , they are Tucker talking points for sure .\nHere \u2019 s the truth .\n\u2022 Ukraine is not \u201c vital \u201d to the U.S. ?\nI guess the Sudetenland , Austria , Czechoslovakia and the Polish corridor weren \u2019 t either , until they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles we now call World War II .\n\u2022 We have no legal or moral obligation to defend Ukraine ?\nIn 1995 , while I worked at the Clinton White House , we signed the Budapest Memo pledging \u201c to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine \u201d and \u201c to refrain from the threat or use of force \u201d against the country .\nWith those assurances in their pocket , the Ukrainian government agreed to give up the 1,900 strategic nuclear warheads on its soil , a force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third largest nuclear arsenal .\n\u2022 As for a moral obligation , President Ronald Reagan based his entire foreign policy on a determination to free the captive people of Eastern Europe , culminating in his famous admonition to \u201c Mr .\nGorbachev \u2013Tear Down this wall.\n\u201d \u2022 Carlson says \u201c Ukraine is not a democracy \u201d , setting up a phony moral equivalency between Kiev and Moscow .\nOnce Ukraine became independent as the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991 , Russia moved swiftly to put in place a puppet government .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ukrainians took to the streets in the dead of winter to demand a fair election .\nAfter three months of frostbite in the sub-zero ( Centigrade ) temperatures , they won and got a new election that the freedom candidate Viktor Yushchenko won with 52 % of the vote .\nSince then , Ukraine has been a functioning democracy with the parties alternating their turns in power .\nIn fact , Yushchenko \u2019 s longtime rival , the pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych won the election of 2010 and served as president until 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream of allegations of corruption .\nThe major source of corruption in Ukraine has been the United States as the Biden family moved in to make a killing .\nDon \u2019 t blame the victim \u2013Ukraine \u2014 for the corruption fostered by Hunter Biden .\nCarlson has been waving the white flag warning against committing U.S. troops to defend Ukraine .\nBut there are no U.S. troops within several hundred miles , and none are in danger of even stubbing their toe in Ukraine .\nWe are watching appeasement in action on Fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt \u2019 s not an invasion .\nIt \u2019 s an incursion .\nIt \u2019 s not important , Ukraine is not a vital ally .\nIt \u2019 s none of our business .\nIt \u2019 s Europe \u2019 s problem .\nThese talking points must be dear to Putin \u2019 s heart as they split the conservative freedom-loving Republicans in America and sap the very limited reservoir of courage and resolve in Joe Biden \u2019 s heart .\nOffering a coward a way out is like buying a drunk

Evil In Ukraine", "content": "Twice so far in the still young 21st-century , we have witnessed a public policy debate they can be reduced to the simple choice between good and evil .\n9/11 was the first and the invasion of Ukraine is the second .\nIn confronting the evil of Russia \u2019 s invasion , we must heed Jesus \u2019 s advice and be \u201c as wise as a serpent , \u201d though not \u201c gentle as the dove.\n\u201d In thirty years of experience in facing communist/Russian propaganda in elections in Mexico , Taiwan , Poland , Hungary , Moldova , Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ve discerned certain patterns in how our adversary fights against human freedom .\nI find myself now applying these lessons to Tucker Carlson \u2019 s and Vladimir Putin \u2019 s defense of the invasion .\nThe Russians of today are apparently not as skilled in combat as their forebears , but their expertise in propaganda and psychological warfare is unparalleled .\nWhen Americans battle to persuade public opinion of their cause , they instinctively rely on what they have learned from advertising .\nWe go right to the heart of the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut the Russian counter is based on the perspective of left-wing journalism which , in turn , draws on the same theory as animates criminal defense attorneys in American court rooms .\nAs Americans hammer away at their central premises , the Russian/Communist model tries to carry the argument by nibbling at the edges .\nJust as a prosecutor assembles evidence to meet his burden of proof , the defense attorney seeks , not to disprove , but to discredit , distract , and divert the state \u2019 s case .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent acolyte Tucker Carlson first defended the invasion as a justified response to NATO creeping ever closer to the Russian frontier .\nThey even tried to persuade the world that the U.S. , which possess thousands of nuclear warheads based around the world and thousands move under its seas , needed to put missiles in Ukraine with which to bombard or at least threaten Moscow .\nWhen their argument failed , they resorted to more typical Russian/Communist strategy by raising the issue of biolabs in Ukraine supposedly in preparation for a campaign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great side issue !\nNow they can exploit our disgust at how Dr. Fauci lied to us all about viral experimentation and secretly funded the Frankensteinian effort to develop COVID .\nIf the government lied to us then , they argue , they probably are lying now when they say that there are no bioweapons in the labs and that they are there to provide a quick antidote to their victims should Russia attack with biological weapons .\nWhy are they in Ukraine ?\nBecause that \u2019 s where the invasion is and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used .\nBut the charge lingers in the air .\nWas there really something up with the labs in Ukraine ?\nIs Kiev part of a web of American deception ?\nMemories of government lies over Vietnam come flooding back .\nSuddenly , the underlying issue of the Russian invasion , Putin \u2019 s land lust , the brutality of civilian carpet bombing , and the threat Russia poses to our country are put aside while we all focus on bio-labs .\nIt was the same story in the war on terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghraib prison , Guantanamo , water boarding , and the Patriot Act .\nThe outrage of 9-11 was buried under the news clippings .\nOn the Fox News Channel , we see the two styles of advocacy collide .\nAt 9 PM , Sean Hannity lays out the case against the Russian invasion with his usual force and moral clarity .\nBut at 8 PM , Tucker Carlson does his best to sow doubts , send up false flag flares , unleash red herrings to distract us from the real issue : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country and take it over since North Korea invaded the South or North Vietnam attacked its neighbor .\nCarlson can defend his coverage as investigative journalism .\nBut in World War II , we all learned the difference between informing America and aiding our enemies .\nWith Carlson \u2019 s video clips regularly broadcast on Russian television to justify the invasion , Tucker must rein it in lest he offer aid and comfort to the enemy .\nGet Your FREE , Gold And Silver Precious Metals Investment Material .\nNo Fee For Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOW !\nSUBSCRIBE TO RECEIVE DICK \u2019 S VIDEOS & COLUMNS FOR FREE \u2014 CLICK HERE

"\u201c China is underwriting this war .\nIn Ukraine.\n\u201d So said a former top Trump Administration official in a private phone conversation with me over the weekend .\n\u201c Xi and Putin are joined at the hip , and it is foolhardy to believe that they can be separated , \u201d he explained .\nHe likened Xi Jinping to a fascist and , at the same time , a Leninist who is intellectual leader of the emerging Putin-Xi mind meld .\n\u201c He truly believes in world revolution and wants , above all else , to topple the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite willing to suffer negative consequences for his country to advance his global agenda .\nBut he emphasized that China is extremely vulnerable to economic sanctions .\nCiting its dependence on foreign trade , he said that China might not be able to survive a global embargo should its policies goad the U.S. and the EU to such action .\nFor the moment , he urges immediate action by the U.S. and the EU to punish China economically for not opposing \u2014 and , in fact , subsidizing \u2014 Putin \u2019 s Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATO meeting will lead to a resolution to take economic action against China .\n\u201c Don \u2019 t just step on China \u2019 s toes , \u201d he advised .\n\u201c Crush their toes.\n\u201d He also said : \u2022 He said that the chances that Putin might use nuclear weapons is \u201c not zero , \u201d describing Putin as \u201c obsessed with Ukraine \u201d and implying that he has megalomania .\n\u2022 He noted that Obama believed that nuclear weapons were obsolete and stripped us of our tactical nuclear weapons , limiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escalation matching Russia \u2019 s action should Putin use such battlefield nukes in Ukraine \u2022 But , he added , that If Putin moves , in desperation , to WMDs in the war , the US need not follow suit but would have to take on Russian troops directly .\nHe argued that our conventional military would be quite enough to directly confront Russia \u201c bombing the hell out of their supply lines \u201d and , as a first step , \u201c wiping out their army in Syria.\n\u201d \u2022 He credits the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what China is doing to help Putin .\n\u2022 But , above all , he emphasizes that Beijing is now the senior partner in their relationship .\nI mentioned to him \u2014 and he agreed \u2014 my belief that if China invades Taiwan or even if it is directly linked to Russian attacks in Ukraine that global condemnation of Beijing would rise to such a crescendo that more direct economic action against China would be politically feasible .\nI pointed out that the US economy weathered quite nicely our drastic increase of about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even suggested that we might suspend debt repayment to China , an annual flow of about $ 20 billion .\nWith international outrage at China \u2019 s actions , the global financial community is likely to permit America to suspend its debt repayments without unduly damaging our credit rating .\nGet Your FREE , Gold And

"content": "A Slogan For Trump And The GOP : Had Enough ?\nAs we approach the elections of \u2019 22 and \u2019 24 , Republicans have so many , many targets : inflation , gas prices , illegal immigration , fentanyl flowing in through open borders , crime and murder surging , killings of police officers , the war in Ukraine caused by U.S. weakness , the domination of education by the radical left that shuts out parents from decision making , the stifling of charter schools , runaway government spending , enormous deficits and federal debt , increasingly rising interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unjustified and unneeded restrictions on our liberty left over from COVID , Iranian progress toward nuclear weapons , encroachments on the Second Amendment , the counter-culture and so many more .\nHow to summarize them for a political campaign ?\nWhat slogan can possibly express the range of our concerns and the fact that all these problems did not exist when Trump was president , and the Republicans ran Congress ?\nMy suggestion is : Had enough ?\nThe ideas of Marshall McLuhan , so well elucidated in his 1964 classic Understanding Media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Massage , explain how any good political slogan acts as a catalyst , stimulating the voter to take an inner mental trip through his own mind and find the ideas the slogan elicits .\nThe power of the slogan rests entirely on what is in the voters \u2019 minds .\nIf all it brings is a shrug , it does not work .\nBut if the voters \u2019 grievances are so many and so deeply felt that the slogan triggers a lengthily list of heartbreaks and headaches , it has hit home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on by the misgovernment of the Biden Administration will likely unleash a torrent of anguish if catalyzed by the right slogan .\n\u201c Had enough ?\n\u201d has a good track record as a successful slogan .\nIn 1946 , facing the daunting task of ending decades of Democratic Congressional majorities , the GOP scarcely knew where to turn .\nPost-war inflation and the unemployment of retiring servicemen coupled with the growing menace of Stalin \u2019 s Russia , post-war food shortages , the corruption of the Truman Administration and a nation-wide railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose a singular focus , they asked voters if they had \u201c had enough \u201d of Democratic rule .\nIt turned out they had .\nThe GOP captured control of both houses , gaining fifty-six sets in the House and twelve in the Senate .\n\u201c Had enough ?\n\u201d will have a different meaning for each voter as it resonates with his or her specific problems and word view .\nJust as Trump \u2019 s successes and Biden \u2019 s failures have no one focus but proceed across a broad spectrum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enough ?\n\u201d gives voters the intellectual leeway ,

continue its policy since 1945 of pricing oil exclusively in dollars or will it accept other means of payment , specifically Chinese Yuan ?\nIf the Saudis join Russia in accepting Yuan as payment for oil , it will undo the dollar supremacy on which our entire financial system has been predicated for eighty years .\nIf the dollar is no longer the preferred global currency , for example , the US may have to convert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade and may not be able to borrow money and run deficits with impunity .\n( Our ability now to do so is unique in the world ) .\nOur current rate of inflation is due to a traditional interaction of too much demand and too little supply .\nBut , if the dollar is dethroned as king , we will begin to see inflation due to a possibly permanent loss of confidence in the value of the dollar , a catastrophic economic consequence .\nThe future of the dollar rests in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader MBS , ( Saudi Arabia \u2019 s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud ) .\nMBS is terrified of the potential of an Iranian nuclear bomb \u2014 as we all should be \u2014 and is opposed to the giveaway deal Biden is trying to conclude with Tehran .\nHe hopes to use his leverage over the dollar in the good cause of stopping the deal .\nFurther , he is alienated by US antipathy toward Saudi Arabia stemming , in part , from the murder of Saudi dissident and Washington Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s secret police while he had been lured to the Saudi consulate in Turkey by promises of the paperwork he needed for his wedding .\nHe was suffocated and his body dismembered .\n( The subtext here is that with the increase in U.S. energy production , the Saudis are afraid of losing their leverage over the US .\nNow they are hoping that their flirtation with China and the threat to dethrone the dollar can restore Saudi leverage ) .\nThe background of the U.S. so the relationship is interesting .\nOn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1945 , a sick and dying FDR ordered his vessel to make a stop in Saudi Arabia so he can confer with the king .\nFDR understood the coming importance of oil in the global economy and got a pledge from the king to only deal in dollars .\nBased on this decision , The whole global economy oriented itself to dollar supremacy and has remained there ever since .\nPerhaps until now .\nJust as FDR \u2019 s prescience in understanding the importance of oil and the dollar , helped create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so , now , Biden \u2019 s profligacy in spending and taxing has so undermined confidence in the tower that FDR \u2019 s work is being undone .\nThis development might

the various April and May Senate and Governor primaries come around , the Trump brand will be sorely tested as the former president is wading into controversy , making risky endorsements in closely fought primaries .\nSo how are his favored candidates doing ?\nSo far , pretty damn well .\nTrump has staked out Senate endorsements in .\nAlabama , Alaska , North Carolina , Ohio , and Pennsylvania .\nAlthough none of the Trump candidates posted leads at the time of his endorsement , four of the five now show the Trump-endorsed candidate in first place .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ JD Vance in the Ohio Senate primary ( to be held May 17 ) appears to have lifted Vance into a lead over previous front runner former state treasurer Josh Mandel .\nBefore Trump came out for Vance on April 15 , an April 13 poll had Mandel in the lead by five points .\nBut after Trump laid hands on Vance , the author led an April 18 poll over Mandel by seven points , a total turn around .\nTrump \u2019 s magic touch is also working in North Carolina \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Budd has opened up a lead of between ten and thirteen points over former Governor and Charlotte mayor Pat McCrory who Trump accuses McCrory of RINOism ; In one of America \u2019 s most closely watched Senate primaries .\nTrump \u2019 s backing of Dr. Oz has tilted the race in the doctor \u2019 s favor in the May 17 primary .\nBusinessman David McCormick had led Oz by 18-11 on Eagle Consulting \u2019 s April 7th poll .\nThen the Trump Bomb hit , and Oz went from a 7-point deficit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn the primary Trump wants to win the most \u2014 his bid to oust Lisa Murkowski in Alaska \u2014 the jury is still out on how Kelly Tshibaka , Murkowski \u2019 s opponent is doing .\nThe most recent poll , by Cygnal had Kelly clinging to a 51-49 lead , a very unusual finding of zero undecided voters in the August 16 primary .\nOnly in Alabama has Trump \u2019 s endorsement not paid off .\nAfter backing Congressman Mo Brooks \u2014 and then reportedly reconsidering his endorsement \u2014 Trump , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong come-from-nowhere opponent Michael Durant , Air Force pilot and the author of Black Hawk Down , an autobiography of his military career .\nDurant leads the race handily .\nIn endorsing in such highly controversial races , Trump is , indeed performing a high wire act .\nShould his candidates lose , the anti-Trump boo-birds will have a field day and the Trump brand will face charges that is has faded since the 2020 election .\nBut so far , so good .\nGet Your FREE , Gold And Silver Precious @ @ @

Dick Morris on May 2 , 2022 Churchill famously described Russia as \u201c a riddle , wrapped in a mystery , inside an enigma.\n\u201d The truth of his observation is evident as the world struggles to divine how Putin will extract himself from the predicament he has created for himself without destroying the world in the process .\nI am not Vladimir \u2019 s political advisor , but perhaps I can offer a suggestion of the course on which he may be embarked .\nRussia has hewed to the phony narrative that Ukraine is Nazi .\nThey dismiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Jewish by saying , as the Russian foreign minister has , that Adolf Hitler himself had Jewish blood .\nWhen Putin launched his invasion , he cited de-Nazification as one of his goals .\nAnd , since then , Russian propaganda has repeatedly depicted the Kiev government as controlled by Nazis .\nThe city of Mariupol , on the Black Sea , where the most intense fighting has waged in recent days is defended by Ukraine \u2019 s Azov Brigade , which is accused by Russia of being Neo-Nazi in origin .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend a huge steel mill In Mariupol that is so heavily fortified that the Russians have been unable to subdue it .\nBut they are trying their best .\nPutin could be timing his attempts to take Mariupol to coincide with May 8th ( VE Day ) \u2014 celebrating the 77th anniversary of Germany \u2019 s conquest in World War II ?\nCould he be planning , in the usual massive celebration in Moscow , to announce the successful de-Nazification of Ukraine with the capture of Mariupol ?\nMight he then declare that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull his troops out ?\nOr , more darkly , if the Azov Brigade refuses to yield , might Putin strike their steel mill redoubt with tactical nuclear weapons , a strike he would attempt to justify as a necessary step in de-Nazification ?\nWhile the global community could be expected to be fierce in their reaction to a nuclear strike , exiling Russia from the planet , the Russian people might buy the explanation .\nWhen Hitler invaded Russia in 1941 , Ukraine was his first target because of its proximity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union .\nEmbittered by Stalin \u2019 s deliberate starvation of many millions of Ukrainians in the 1930s , vast numbers of them rallied to the German side .\nIt was only several months later that they came to realize Hitler \u2019 s goal was not to liberate Ukraine , but to kill millions more to make room for the growing population of Germany , saying he needed Lebensraum ( Living Space ) .\nThe Ukrainians turned on Hitler and mounted some of the most successful and deadly guerrilla resistance fighting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s initially pro-Nazi stance remains a staple of Russian propaganda .\nIn Ukraine , as Faulkner said about the American South \u201c the past is not past .\nIn fact , it hasn \u2019 t even passed.\n\u201d So , the narrative of de-Nazification will strike deeply into the memory banks of millions of Russians and retroactively justify \u2014 to them \u2014 the invasion and even the use of nuclear weapons .\nGet Your FREE , Gold And Silver Precious Metals Investment Material .\nNo Fee For Life IRA Program Now Available @ @ @ @ @ @ @

would think the Earth was shifting under our feet with the report that the Supreme Court had decided to overrule Roe v. Wade .\nThe fact is that not much will change .\nThe Mississippi law under review only bans abortions after 15 weeks , almost up to the start of the second trimester .\nIt does nothing to limit them before 15 weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t know you are pregnant after four months , you need more than a pregnancy test .\nYou need to have your head examined .\nEspecially with the 15 week deadline publicized and well known , it is almost inconceivable that a pregnant woman would be surprised to learn that she is with child after 15 weeks .\nAnd , even then , the possible court decision does not make abortion illegal .\nIt just lets the states do so if they wish .\nAt least half the states will likely vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a little bus fare , likely to be available from the millions being donated to pro-choice groups , would solve the problem .\nThe CDC reports that 92.7 percent of all abortions take place in the first 13 weeks weeks of gestation , when the procedure would still be legal in all states .\nOnly 6.2 percent are done between the 14th and 20th week and less than 1 percent thereafter .\nOf the 629,000 abortions a year in the US , only 4,400 were after 13th week , let alone after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states outlawed abortion the number of abortions outlawed before the 15th week is likely less than one thousand a year !\nSo what is all the fuss about ?\nIncendiaries on the left and the right have made a good living off the issue for 50 years and there \u2019 s no reason for them to stop now .\nHyperbole will run well ahead of fact as this debate evolves .\nBut the plain fact is that the court decision won \u2019 t amount to much .\nGet Your FREE , Gold And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fee For Life IRA Program Now Available \u2014 CLICK HERE NOW !\nSUBSCRIBE TO RECEIVE DICK \u2019 S

in Missouri and nominee Joe Donnelly in Indiana when they shot themselves in the head with unforced errors that cost them \u2014 and us \u2014 the seats .\nNow , we look prepared to give away yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominating Kathy Barnette in the Pennsylvania Republican Senate Primary .\nAkin , you \u2019 ll recall , single-handedly re-elected McCaskill when he said that women who were victims of \u201c legitimate rape \u201d rarely get pregnant and by implication , did not need abortions .\nMourdock lost his seat when he said that when a woman was raped , it was because \u201c God intended it to happen \u201d and , therefore , opposed abortion .\nRIP .\nBut let \u2019 s not allow a crazy primary result to saddle us with another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot every time she speaks .\nIf Kathy Barnette beats Dr , Oz , Trump \u2019 s candidate , in Tuesday \u2019 s Republican primary for Senate , we will have to spend the entire campaign explaining away her self-inflicted verbal wounds like : \u2022 She said it was \u201c OK \u201d to discriminate against Muslims and compared the religion \u2019 s world view to those of Hitler and Stalin .\n\u2022 She argued that accepting homosexuality would lead to acceptance of incest and pedophilia and called pedophilia the \u201c Cornerstone of Islam.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ be allowed into the U.S. Who needs to drag this record around when we are trying to capture the Senate ?\nWe have serious business here and don \u2019 t have time to defend nutty comments .\nSo , let \u2019 s get on with it and give Donald Trump the Senate he needs to govern , not

"By Dick Morris on May 18 , 2022 As Ukraine remains in a life-and-death struggle for its existence , Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky. , took to the Senate floor last week to temporarily block U.S. aid to this embattled nation .\nThe bill up for passage would provide immediate military and humanitarian assistance \u2013 some $ 40 billion to Ukraine .\nThe timing is critical as numerous cities remain under Russian siege , and as Ukraine is finally gaining momentum in repulsing Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2019 s savage invasion .\nPaul is indifferent to the emergency situation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package would \u201c doom the U.S. economy.\n\u201d It would do nothing of the sort .\nThe Senate bill is a mirror of a House bill that passed with a strong bipartisan majority .\nThere is also strong bipartisan support in the Senate .\nPaul knows he is using Senate privilege to effectively delay the passage of the bill and prevent the immediate assistance to the heroic Ukrainians defending their homeland .\nThey are also defending our freedoms .\nPaul \u2019 s decision to take this callous action reminds us of Republican isolationist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 40s , thundered against aid to Britain as Nazi armies conquered most of Europe and prepared to invade England .\nThese senators said the conflict in Europe was not \u201c our fight \u201d and objected to sending millions in aid to Britain .\n\u201c Why do we want to spend our resources helping a nation three thousand miles away ?\n\u201d they asked , \u201c when we have an economic depression here at home ?\n\u201d No surprise the isolationists won popular support for their ostrich position .\nThen came the rude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1941 .\nAmerica realized two oceans were not sufficient insulation from world conflict anymore .\nRand Paul and a small band of Republican congressmen are using the same arguments and the same phony construct to oppose aid to Ukraine .\nIt is a message that Fox News \u2019 Tucker Carlson has been pushing for weeks : Why are we spending money on Ukraine when we need money for cancer research , roads and bridges , border security \u2014 and as we struggle to keep gas prices down and fight inflation .\nCarlson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Fox News has been abetting his position with little or no coverage of Russia \u2019 s war on Ukraine during its prime-time hours .\nFox \u2019 s audience is becoming increasingly blind to the reality of this war , opening the door for Rand Paul and others .\nThankfully most Americans see the real danger Vladimir Putin poses to all of us .\nWe have seen with our very own eyes the massacres on the streets of Bucha and across occupied Ukraine of innocent men , women and children .\nMass graves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concentration camps .\nPutin could not capture Mariupol so he decided to level the city , killing perhaps tens of thousands .\nWe have not witnessed atrocities like this since Stalin and Hitler paraded their armies across Europe .\nThe Ukrainians are not asking , as Paul claims , that America be the \u201c world policemen.\n\u201d They are asking only that we provide the tools \u2013 weapons , ammunition , and essentials like food \u2013 to support their sacrifice .\nPaul would do well to read Putin \u2019 s several speeches since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he makes clear Russia is at war with the West and the United States .\nEven dovish Europe sees the threat .\nAnd Sweden and Finland , which have long bragged about their neutrality and had no interest in joining NATO , suddenly have done an about-face .\nToday , Helsinki authorities are prepping their bomb shelters and bunkers for war , perhaps a nuclear one .\nThey are leaving nothing to chance .\nBut as in the 1930s , America seems very far from the fighting , and quite safe .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rand Paul argued in his recent Senate speech .\nHe even claimed in the same speech that we need to learn the lesson of the Soviet Union , which he says collapsed for economic reasons , not from a military defeat .\nBut so much of what he says about Ukraine makes little sense ; Paul should re-read his history books .\nThe Soviet Union collapsed because President Reagan , ignoring worries about the federal deficit , began a massive military build-up .\nHe also funded advanced weaponry like Stinger missiles for Afghan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costly missile defense program .\nAmerica simply outspent the Soviets .\nAnd Reagan \u2019 s massive spending \u2013 which Paul would have abhorred \u2013 paved the way for the \u201c peace dividend , \u201d decades of prosperity and the first balanced budgets in decades .\nAmerica is now faced with an enemy openly talking about using weapons of mass destruction against NATO .\nThe lesson of history could not be clearer : If we don \u2019 t fight those who would invade their neighbors , we will be stuck fighting them on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Rand Paul and Tucker Carlson said our early support of Ukraine would be a slippery slope to direct U.S. involvement against Russia .\nBut they have already been proven wrong on their predictions .\nEarly U.S. and European support to Ukraine has paid off , and Russia is either stalled or in retreat .\nThe truth is , $ 40 billion is a small amount to stop a much larger and more costly war .\nRand Paul can worry about the deficit , but he should not delay assistance to these heroic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us .\nGet Your FREE , Gold And Silver Precious Metals Investment Material .\nNo Fee For Life IRA Program Now Available \u2014 CLICK HERE NOW !\nSUBSCRIBE TO RECEIVE DICK \u2019 S VIDEOS & COLUMNS FOR FREE \u2014 CLICK HERE !\nView Dick \u2019 s most recent videos in case you missed them !\nHow The New Deal Defeated The Great Depression \u2013 Dick Morris TV : History Video !\nRussia Has Made One Of The Stupidest Mistakes In History \u2013 Dick Morris TV : Lunch Alert !", "author": "Dick Morris", "url": "https://www.dickmorris.com/rand-pauls-dangerous-stall-on-ukraine-aid/", "published": "Wed, 18 May 2022 12:00:54 +0000", "published_utc": 1652889654, "collection_utc": 1652912809}, {"id": "dickmorrisblog--2022-05-18--81 of 84 Trump-Endorsed Candidates Won \u2013 Lunch Alert!", "date": "2022-05-18", "source": "dickmorrisblog", "title": "81 of 84 Trump-Endorsed Candidates Won \u2013 Lunch Alert!", "content": "By Dick Morris on May 18 , 2022 Click Here to give me your thoughts and continue the discussion .\n@ @ @ @ @ any friends or family who may be interested in viewing my video .\nGet Your @ @ @ @ @ Precious Metals Investment Material .\nNo Fee For Life IRA Program Now Available \u2014 CLICK @ @ @ @ @ RECEIVE DICK \u2019 S VIDEOS & COLUMNS FOR FREE \u2014 CLICK HERE !\nView Dick @ @ @ @ @ in case you missed them !\nHow The New Deal Defeated The Great Depression \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ Video !\nRussia Has Made One Of The Stupidest Mistakes In History \u2013 Dick Morris @ @ @ @ @ The Real Story In The Pennsylvania Primary \u2013 Dick Morris TV : Lunch Alert !", "author": "Dick Morris", "url": "https://www.dickmorris.com/81-of-84-trump-endorsed-candidates-won-lunch-alert/", "published": "Wed, 18 May 2022 11:00:21 +0000", "published_utc": 1652886021, "collection_utc": 1652912809}, {"id": "dickmorrisblog--2022-05-19--Abortion Decision Has No Impact On GOP Chances In Fall Elections", "date": "2022-05-19", "source": "dickmorrisblog", "title": "Abortion Decision Has No Impact On GOP Chances In Fall Elections", "content": "Abortion Decision Has No Impact On GOP Chances In Fall Elections By Dick Morris on May 19 , 2022 A comparison of polling before and after the May 3 , 2022 , leak of the Alito opinion striking down Roe v.

in-person meeting in years , is mulling the possibility of negotiating a global pandemic treaty which would regulate how nations respond to crisis such as the Covid virus posed .\nConservatives are warning about a power grab by the global body in which the proposed treaty would tell member states how to enforce lockdowns , quarantines , masking requirements , and immunization programs .\nTo stem a potential global backlash , the WHO is downplaying the talks and saying the treaty is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience indicates that such conjectural notions have a way of making it into international law without anyone noticing or being able to object .\nDefenders of a treaty like to reassure us .\nSuerie Moon , co-director of the Global Health Center at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva , said that \u201c even if the text for a treaty on pandemic preparedness is reached , it would have to be signed , ratified , and enforced by the member states themselves .\nAny treaty will have to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent years , UN global organizations have treated as decided international law agreements that have neither been ratified nor , in many cases even been submitted to national legislatures for approval .\nExamples include the Global Covenant to Limit Clutter in space , the human rights laws embodied in the International Criminal Court treaty , certain provisions of the Law of the Sea Treaty .\nThe body of international law that is binding on nations , is not limited by legislative approvals and actions .\nA kind of common law has evolved which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in any treaty .\nUnder the terms of the Vienna Convention \u2014 ratified by the U.S. \u2014 when a nation signs a treaty but has not yet ratified it , that nation may not take any action that would violate the treaty until the signature is either rescinded or the treaty is ratified .\nThe Small Arms Treaty , which would regulate sales of handguns and the like , has never been even submitted to the U.S. Senate , but many judges feel bound by its terms and the National Rifle Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the potential for firearms confiscation are seeping into regulatory and judicial decisions in many states .\nSo be on the lookout for a Pandemic Preparedness Treaty to supersede U.S. state and federal law that might be enforced through the Vienna Convention

fair trial in D.C .\nThe situation presents a grim metaphor : During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Justice recognized that it could not get a fair trial from an all white jury in the south when the charges involved racist crimes .\nThat led to a prosecutorial strategy to avoid such juries .\nIn fact , the DOJ simply bypassed local laws and chose to prosecute even crimes like murder not under the criminal law of each state , but under the federal civil rights statutes thereby assuring a fair trial before an out of state jury \u2014 or no jury at all .\nProsecutors should attempt to bring @ @ @

deserting the Democratic Party in droves .\nCoupled with the increasing defection of Hispanics , the Democratic Party label is battered and bleeding .\nA John Jordan survey of May 25-30 , 2022 conducted by McLaughlin and Associates , shows that President Trump has completely erased his deficit among young voters .\nThe Jordan-McLaughlin survey , examined political attitudes among two generations : Generation Z ( aged 18-30 ) and Millennial ( aged 30-41 ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen Z by a five point margin : Biden : 43 and Trump : 38 .\nBut , if the election were today , they would flip and back Trump by 4 points .\nTrump : 52 , Biden : 48 .\nGen Z voters are now part of the Republican base !\nThe Millennials , the sons and daughters of the 60s activist Boomer generation are more liberal than their younger Gen Z peers .\nBut , they too are deserting Biden .\nWhile Biden carried Millennials in 2020 by a whopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut in half \u2014 to ten points \u2014 if the

issue , Biden \u2019 s ratings are terrible among Gen Z voters and only marginal among Millennials COMPARISON OF BIDEN AND TRUMP ON ECONOMIC ISSUES 1 .\nThe economy , making a living , the cost of living , gas prices , inflation , and the economy are not only the most important issues to these young voters .\nThey are the only issue .\nDemocrats can try to win by riding the issue du @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the economic issues .\nBut it is a futile hope as long as Republicans keep talking about the economic questions .\nDemocrats want to talk about the Court decisions on abortion , the Uvalde student massacre , the war in Ukraine , not that these are winning issues , but they are distractions from the economy .\nRepublicans must be insistent at dragging the discussion back to the economy .\nAnd they will find it easy as people shop or buy gas .\n2 .\nNothing else really matters .\nYounger voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must talk about the economy and nothing but .\nDespite their overall drift to the right over economic issues , Gen Z and Millennial voters remain very liberal on social policy .\nMost of the issues popular on the right are unpopular with these voters .\nTheir polling responses are from another planet on social populist issues .\nParticularly Millennials do not share any of the Republican perspectives on social issues .\nWe tested a variety of social issues and after explaining them , giving both sides point of view , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to vote for Trump or more likely to vote for Biden .\nHere are the results : Best to stay with the economy issue !\n15 % of Biden voters said the economy made them more likely to vote for Trump .\nWhat Trump himself could not accomplish in office nor could his public relations handlers , Joe Biden has accomplished : he has made Donald Trump acceptable to voters despite their concerns about his personality .\nThe worse Joe Biden looks and the worse economy is the better Donald Trump looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a frame around a portrait of Donald Trump that makes him look brighter and better .\nWe asked Millennial and Gen Z voters this question : Q .\nAt first , like many young people I did not like Trump while he was president or during his campaign , but the more I see now of what has happened after he left office I \u2019 m giving Donald Trump a new look and liking him better .\nAt the end of the survey , after reading the respondents , all the positives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked again how they would vote ( called the \u201c informed ballot \u201d ) .\nThere was a decided shift to Trump suggesting that even

Bore Responsibility For January 6", "content": "The conclusion that seems to be emerging from the hearings of the phony January 6 committee is that somehow Donald Trump was directly responsible for the riot .\nThis conclusion is despite his plea to the demonstrators to go home peacefully and patriotically .\nIf this was inciting to riot it \u2019 s hard to believe what would not be .\nThe charge , as echoed in The Wall Street Journal , is that Trump inciting his base by lying about the election and trying to \u201c con them \u201d into believing that he won the election .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges but let me try .\nIn my view , the facts are these : If all votes legitimately cast by eligible voters were accurately and fairly counted , Joe Biden would have received more votes than Donald Trump .\nHowever clear election irregularities in the swing states of Pennsylvania , Michigan , Arizona , Georgia , and Wisconsin must be taken it into account .\nBut they never were .\nDemocratic Secretaries of State in Pennsylvania Michigan Arizona and Wisconsin stopped any investigation into the irregularities .\nDespite numerous accurate reports of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ineligible voters , double voting , postdated ballots , and many other types of shenanigans , the administrative officials in charge of the election refused to investigate it , which was their duty .\nThe various state legislatures also neglected their duty to assure that the voting was honest .\nDespite Republican majorities in Pennsylvania , Michigan , Arizona , Georgia and Wisconsin there was no legislative audit of the voting until after the election results that were in , and Biden declared the winner .\nThe state courts too , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs the triers of fact , they should have appointed special masters and given them subpoena power and enough staff to investigate the allegations of fraud .\nInstead , they delayed and dithered while the secretaries of state and the Democratic governors declared that Biden had carried that state .\nWhen Trump \u2019 s people sought to appeal to the federal courts , the jurists cited the fact that the state courts had to be the triers of fact and that the federal courts could only adjudicate legal issues on the appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats used objections to stand to block adjudication of the lawsuit brought by Texas and other states .\nSo those who saw the election as fraudulent had no alternative but to demonstrate .\nThe state legislatures , the federal courts , and the state courts all refused to investigate the facts and render a fair and impartial verdict .\nSo their only option was to protest the final certification of the electoral count in the US Congress .\nA score of Republican senators pled with the vice president to do so but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no investigation .\nAfter election Day , state audits in Georgia and Arizona revealed major irregularities sufficient to invalidate the election margin in at least those states .\nDon \u2019 t confuse the Arizona audit with the Arizona recount .\nThe recount showed no mathematical error in the tabulation , but the audit showed that these counts were based on tens of thousands of fraudulent votes .\nBut no audit could offer a final verdict because of the secret ballot .\nNo one could determine if the fraudulent votes were for Biden or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Democrats had conceived of a plan to get away with these irregularities in sufficient number to deliver these states to Biden .\nThese facts make clear that Trump was not attempting to con anybody by saying that he won the election .\nHe was just stating his opinion based on the evidence .\nSince then , the various audits have only confirmed that opinion .\nTo say that Trump was repeating a big lie is , itself to articulate a big lie .\nThat the demonstrations turned violent despite Trump \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the video of his remarks played at the Jan 6 Committee hearing

you are to vote for Trump and the Republicans .\nThe opposite used to be true , but Biden \u2019 s poor performance in office and the inflation and economic crisis he has spawned have changed all that .\nJohn Jordan , John McLaughlin , and I conducted a survey of 800 Generation Z and Millennial likely voters at the end of last month to see how they had changed since they mainly voted for Biden in 2020 .\nThe transformation is enormous .\nGeneration Z voters , who are now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump , his biggest gain in any age group .\nIn the 2020 election , they backed Biden by 3 points .\nNow they vote for Trump against Biden by 6 points , an incredible nine-point swing .\nHere \u2019 s what \u2019 s happening among voters still in their 20s .\nThose who are still in college or have not yet turned 25 , have been liberal and stay liberal .\nBut a light seems to turn on in their minds as soon as they turn 26 .\nThey suddenly turn conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we asked them and here \u2019 s their explanation : By almost two to one , they say \u201c When I was younger , I was more ideological and idealistic but as I grew older and have had to support my family and make a living I \u2019 ve grown more realistic and conservative in my thinking.\n\u201d So , if you \u2019 re worried about the indoctrination young people go through in college and are concerned that the campuses are breeding a nation of liberals , relax .\nAs soon as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change and see the wisdom of our point of view .\nMillennials , who are now in the 30s are more of a problem .\nThey are the sons and daughters of the baby baby boomer generation who became 60s radicals , marching and burning their draft cards .\nThey have gone on to become the most left-wing generation in our country .\nBut they too can not ignore the economic catastrophe of the Biden presidency and find themselves drifting more towards Donald Trump .\nWhile they voted overwhelmingly for Biden in 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut Biden \u2019 s margin among them in half and now trails by ten .\nIt is turning out that Joe Biden is the best friend Republicans have .\nAs a result of his disastrous presidency and the terrible economy , voters are coming to appreciate Donald Trump much more .\nBy a margin of 66 to 32 voters in their 30s , the millennials , agree that \u201c like many young people I did not like Trump when he was president or running for office .\nBut now that I see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a new appreciation for him and find myself liking him more and more.\n\u201d , Metaphorically , many voters saw a portrait of Donald Trump that they did not like but when Joe Biden put a frame around the portrait with his terrible presidency , it made the picture look a lot better .\nWhat Donald Trump could not do , and his handlers could not achieve , Joe Biden has managed to accomplish : he made Trump likable .\nMake a no mistake , those under 40 are not socially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the leftists .\nThey are largely pro-choice and in favor of gun control .\nMost to do not object to sex and diversity education even among young children .\nThey say climate change is a major threat and feel the Republicans don \u2019 t do enough to counter it .\nThey split down the middle on immigration with half saying that too many illegal illegals are coming in and half saying too many good people are being kept out out .\nHalf support teaching Critical Race Theory in schools .\nBut none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their vote .\nThe only issue they are concerned about is the economy and inflation .\nFaced with the necessity of overcoming these headwinds to feed their children \u2014 and their infants \u2013establish their careers , and buy their first home , they have become economic conservatives while still being social liberals .\nObviously , this dramatic shift among young voters will help propel the Republicans into a massive victory in 22 and likely in 24 .\nBut it \u2019 s long-term implications or even more significant .\nThese young voters will of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our country .\nThe legacy of Ronald Reagan is that voters who came to be politically conscious during his presidency became largely Republican and conservative offsetting the more liberal values of the millennial generation that preceded them .\nAnd , of course , The scar left by the great depression shaped the political views of an entire generation , now , sadly , dying out .\nIt \u2019 s a little bit like cutting down a tree and looking at the rings in its trunk .\nTraumatic events like droughts or forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tree .\nIn fact , in the forests of Siberia you can see , in any tree , evidence of a meteorite strike that happened in 1908 .\nYou can bet that the meteorite strike of Biden \u2019 s failure and the massive inflation it \u2019 s causing will remain indelibly imprinted in the minds of voters now forming their political opinions .\nCombined with the Democrats \u2019 increasing aversion to reality as they embrace the radical green revolution sending gas prices soaring and the economy tanking , the scars we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be with for a long , long time , making good Republicans out of them .\nJohn Jordan , who Is my guest today , John McLaughlin , who was Trump \u2019 s pollster and I have now conducted four surveys to examine how strong the base of the Democratic Party is and how to undermine it .\nIn the first survey we examined Hispanics and found that their patriotism was leading them to despise the left that tears down the country , demeans its heroes and accuses us of racism .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ancestors came here often at risk of their lives , are not about to see this country deteriorate into a nation like the one they left .\nThe shift has been so remarkable that it \u2019 s very possible now that Democratic congressman in the Rio Grande valley will be defeated and Republicans elected .\nAmong mothers , the second leg of the Democratic base , we found that social issues like teaching about gender change and transsexuality to fourth graders were driving them crazy .\nAs Democrats sided with Edu-crats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voice in the education of their children , pushing them into our arms .\nAmong black voters , we found that men were growing increasingly disenchanted with the left since it seems only to address the problems of black women .\nNot black men .\nA black woman becomes vice president and only a woman of color , not a man , is considered for the Supreme Court .\nThese trends , combined with our current findings about young voters bespeak a tectonic shift in the parties and make up of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Silver Precious Metals Investment Material .\nNo Fee For Life IRA Program Now Available \u2014 CLICK HERE NOW

Out", "content": "Abortion Extremes Will Cancel Each Other Out The recent Supreme Court decision on abortion is not likely to have a big impact at the federal level , but its impact on state races might still be significant .\nThe decision very clearly kicks the issue back to the states and Democratic efforts to codify Roe and make it a voting issue in Congress are not likely to succeed or to register much with the public .\nHowever , at the state level particularly , in governors \u2019 races in swing states like Pennsylvania , Michigan , Ohio , North Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue could tip the balance in favor of the Democratic candidates for governor .\nBut it may not .\nThe positions of the two political parties on abortion are extreme polar opposites .\nThe Democrats favor abortion on demand at any point in the pregnancy including the moment of birth .\nShoot them on the way out .\nRepublicans oppose abortion at any moment during the pregnancy including the moments after conception and they apply the ideology even in cases of rape , incest , or the danger to the life of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with much public approval .\n[ Watch My Video \u201c The Extremes On Abortion Will Cancel Each Other Out \u201d \u2014 CLICK HERE ! ]\nThe PEW research organization published its definitive finding last week when they gave voters six choices on abortion three pro-choice and three pro-life .\nIt asked voters they believe that abortion should be legal or illegal in all cases , legal or illegal in most cases with a few exceptions , or legal or illegal with many exceptions .\nOverall , the pro-choice point of view got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro-life got 40 % .\nBut , more significantly , the absolutes at each end got very few votes .\nThe purist pro-life position has only 9 % of support and the purist pro-abortion position gets only 17 % support .\nSo only 26 % of the voters opted for either of the extremes while 72 % had nuances to their opinions .\nBut neither side in the abortion issue will permit nuance to dominate or even to be heard .\nIn a typical campaign , the Democrat will accuse the Republican of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rape involved and the Republicans will reply that the Democrat supports abortion right up to the instant of live birth .\nBoth positions will turn voters off massively and they will offset each other neutralizing the issue for both sides .\nAnd many voters \u2014 particularly in pro-abortion states \u2014 are likely to tune out once they realize that the court decision will have no impact in their own state because their rights to abortion are already well protected by state legislation .\nThis \u201c not in my backyard \u201d philosophy is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue .\nSo , overall the Democratic hopes that

would run for president in 2024 , Hillary answered : \u201c No , out of the question .\nFirst of all , I expect Biden to run .\nHe certainly intends to run .\nIt would be very disruptive to challenge

become hard to ignore and speculation that he \u2019 s too old and too out of it to be president multiplies .\nStep Two : The Democrats get massacred in the \u2019 22 election losing both houses , losing the Senate by 55-45 , and losing key governors \u2019 races in New York , Georgia , North Carolina , Michigan , Wisconsin and Pennsylvania .\nStep Three : Shell shocked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pelosi

Step Four : It becomes clear that Harris is too weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her poor polling shows it .\nWith Harris polling in the low 20s and unable to unite the party , she follows Biden and announces that she won \u2019 t run in \u2019 24 .\nStep Five : Unleashed , the left wing of the Democratic Party demands that its candidate head the ticket .\nBut Sanders is too old and Warren too unpopular , so

on The New York Post on July 5 , 2022 Donald Trump is definitely running for president again in 2024 and will easily win the Republican nomination and retake the White House , his self-proclaimed \u201c secret adviser \u201d claims in a provocative new book .\nPurchase The Return : Trump \u2019 s Big 2024 Comeback \u2014 CLICK HERE NOW !\nDick Morris , a veteran political consultant who advised Bill Clinton for years , says he served as an unpaid , back-channel adviser to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eugene Morris , was the longtime real estate lawyer for Trump \u2019 s dad , Fred , and then son Donald .\nSo they have a longtime connection .\nIn his new book \u201c The Return : Trump \u2019 s 2024 Comeback \u201d ( Humanix Books ) , Morris claims that voters who have buyer \u2019 s remorse over President Biden and the Democrats \u2014 historic inflation and gas prices and fears of a recession , among other things \u2014 will welcome Trump back to the Oval Office because of his superior policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump Win ?\nYes and yes !\nI have spoken with the former president dozens of times since he left office , and our conversations were always either about how he was cheated in 2020 , or how he would get back in in 2024 , \u201d Morris writes .\n\u201c He has never , for a moment , taken his eye off the ball \u2014 getting back in the White House !\n\u2026 But can he win ?\nNot only can he win , he will win , and nobody else can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45th president , he will be our 47th as well !\n\u201c Accept no substitutes .\nOnly he can put together the coalition that generated 74 million votes in 2020 .\nAnd we don \u2019 t want a bleached-out , kinder , nicer , gentler Donald Trump , either !\nWe want and need the same Donald Trump who won in 2016 , increased his vote share in 2020 by eleven million votes , and in between , was one of our truly great presidents.\n\u201d The controversial image maker \u2014 whose own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s re-election campaign in 1996 amid a prostitution scandal \u2014 called Trump \u201c one of America \u2019 s great presidents \u201d with \u201c immense achievements.\n\u201d \u201c But the greater tribute is how he defied almost every establishment in the country to achieve what America needed , and our people demanded , \u201d writes Morris .\nHe said voters like Trump \u2019 s more popular tax , energy and immigration policies better than those of Biden and the Democrats , while crediting the ex-president with bringing more Hispanic voters into the GOP fold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by getting Congress to pass a massive tax cut , skillfully crafted to aim at the middle class , the working poor , and small businesses .\nThe establishment said cut taxes on the wealthy , and it will trickle down to the rest of society .\nBut Trump knew that trickle-down doesn \u2019 t always happen .\nSo he made sure his tax cuts were the first in recent history to target the lower middle class \u2014 the working class .\nTrump signed a law giving a tax credit of $ 2,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , Biden and other Democrats will have to defend four years of record inflation , surging crime and increased illegal immigration at the southern border .\n\u201c Proving that Trump would do better ?\nThat one is easy .\nWe know that Trump would do better , because when he was president , he did do better , \u201d Morris said .\n\u201c Coming off four years of no inflation , little illegal immigration , and for the first three years of his term , little rise in crime , who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again \u2014 where Biden failed ?\nBiden can \u2019 t change his position .\nThe Democrats are stuck with their record of inflation , illegal immigration , and rising crime , and no amount of maneuvering or clever talking points can get them out of it.\n\u201d Morris said Trump has been vindicated by making America \u2019 s energy dependence from foreign oil a greater priority than the Democrats \u2019 push for climate change , with gas prices at nearly $ 5 a gallon at the pump .\n\u201c The environmental establishment wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind and solar energy .\nBut Trump pointed out that we have worked hard for forty years to be energy independent , \u201d he said .\n\u201c So why would we give that power away ?\nEspecially for solar panels that don \u2019 t work when it \u2019 s cloudy , and wind turbines that don \u2019 t turn on calm days .\nInstead , he said , let America be the OPEC of the future and use our energy power for democracy and human rights.\n\u201d He said America was energy independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morris \u2019 book , Trump told The Post , \u201c I \u2019 ve known Dick Morris for a longtime and his father was a great real estate lawyer who represented me very well .\nDick is a very talented person , and I would ask for his advice and opinions on matters of politics .\nIt \u2019 s what he loves and does best , and he \u2019 s very good at it.\n\u201d Purchase The Return : Trump \u2019 s Big 2024 Comeback \u2014 CLICK HERE NOW !\nOn another issue important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republicans have a strong hand to play as the law-and-order party and paint Biden and the Democrats as soft on crime during the fall midterms and in 2024 .\nHe said the left wing of the Democratic Party \u2019 s campaign to defund the police is a gift to Trump and the GOP .\n\u201c The crime issue is particularly toxic for the Democrats , because it is obvious to voters that it was not nearly as bad a problem before Biden was elected .\nBack in 2019 , and before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and faded in popular consciousness .\nBut after Biden \u2019 s election , the movement to defund the police , and the vilification of dedicated , responsible , fair , and hardworking police officers has set the crime rate soaring .\nSo who is to blame ?\nFigure it out !\n, \u201d Morris said .\n\u201c The Left wants to cut the number of uniformed police and replace them with social workers and psychologists to stem violence and escalation .\nSo the next time you worry that a criminal is trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wait for a social worker to arrive , \u201d he said .\n\u201c The Left \u2019 s goal is not to reduce crime by cutting the number of murders , rapes , and robberies .\nIt is to reduce punishment , incarceration , and harsh sentencing by decriminalizing crime.\n\u201d He said decriminalization of marijuana makes sense , but Democrats have gone overboard with policies such as eliminating cash bail .\n\u201c By meting out short sentences and allowing defendants to avoid showing up for trial without sanctions , the Left is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all criminal behavior \u2014 the decriminalization of crime !\nCrime and punishment are being replaced by crime and looking the other way , \u201d said Morris .\nBut Morris downplays the Jan. 6 , 2021 , riots at the Capitol building in the book , written before the recent revelations during congressional hearings about Trump \u2019 s role in the incitement of demonstrators .\nHe said the Democrats in Congress overplayed their hand by impeaching Trump over his supporters breaching the Capitol building .\n\u201c The conduct of the January 6 mob was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at insurrection that the media reported , \u201d the Trump pal claims .\n\u201c There is a fiddling-while-Rome-burns quality to the hearings .\nMuch ado and much distraction about nothing .\nThe more attention the issue draws , the more it becomes apparent that the Democrats are not talking about the concerns that bedevil the average person \u2014 high prices and inflation at the pump , \u201d he said .\nMorris likened the Democrats \u2019 obsession with Trump and the Jan. 6 protests to Republicans in Congress moving to impeach President Bill Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which hurt the GOP in the 1998 midterm elections because voters thought they made a mountain out of a molehill .\nThe book also was written before the Supreme Court rulings that tossed out restrictions on concealed guns , overturned the federal right to abortion and scrapped executive power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions on power plants without congressional approval , which could galvanize Democrats to go to the polls .\n\u201c I do not think any of this term \u2019 s Supreme Court rulings will have an adverse effect on Trump \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in \u2019 22 or \u2019 24 , \u201d he said .\n\u201c The abortion decision has the most potential impact but , since state laws remain in force , the impact is largely theoretical and when people see how it works out they \u2019 ll see that very little has really changed.\n\u201d He said the court \u2019 s decision tossing out New York \u2019 s concealed gun carry law \u201c has to be viewed in the context of woke pro-criminal reforms like defunding police .\nPeople will see the reasonableness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t protect us , we should have the right to protect ourselves.\n\u201d The court \u2019 s decision to restrict the president \u2019 s authority to impose environmental regulations to rein in pollution won \u2019 t hurt the GOP because \u201c the high gas prices have worn out the welcome \u201d of

Originally Published on The New York Post on July 5 , 2022 Donald Trump is definitely running for president again in 2024 and will easily win the Republican nomination and retake the White House , his self-proclaimed \u201c secret adviser \u201d claims in a provocative new book .\nPurchase The Return : Trump \u2019 s Big 2024 Comeback \u2014 CLICK HERE NOW !\nDick Morris , a veteran political consultant who advised Bill Clinton for years , says he served as an unpaid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His father , Eugene Morris , was the longtime real estate lawyer for Trump \u2019 s dad , Fred , and then son Donald .\nSo they have a longtime connection .\nIn his new book \u201c The Return : Trump \u2019 s 2024 Comeback \u201d ( Humanix Books ) , Morris claims that voters who have buyer \u2019 s remorse over President Biden and the Democrats \u2014 historic inflation and gas prices and fears of a recession , among other things \u2014 will welcome Trump back to the Oval Office because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Run ?\nWill Trump Win ?\nYes and yes !\nI have spoken with the former president dozens of times since he left office , and our conversations were always either about how he was cheated in 2020 , or how he would get back in in 2024 , \u201d Morris writes .\n\u201c He has never , for a moment , taken his eye off the ball \u2014 getting back in the White House !\n\u2026 But can he win ?\nNot only can he win , he will win , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was our 45th president , he will be our 47th as well !\n\u201c Accept no substitutes .\nOnly he can put together the coalition that generated 74 million votes in 2020 .\nAnd we don \u2019 t want a bleached-out , kinder , nicer , gentler Donald Trump , either !\nWe want and need the same Donald Trump who won in 2016 , increased his vote share in 2020 by eleven million votes , and in between , was one of our truly great presidents.\n\u201d The controversial image maker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Clinton \u2019 s re-election campaign in 1996 amid a prostitution scandal \u2014 called Trump \u201c one of America \u2019 s great presidents \u201d with \u201c immense achievements.\n\u201d \u201c But the greater tribute is how he defied almost every establishment in the country to achieve what America needed , and our people demanded , \u201d writes Morris .\nHe said voters like Trump \u2019 s more popular tax , energy and immigration policies better than those of Biden and the Democrats , while crediting the ex-president with bringing more Hispanic voters into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economic establishment by getting Congress to pass a massive tax cut , skillfully crafted to aim at the middle class , the working poor , and small businesses .\nThe establishment said cut taxes on the wealthy , and it will trickle down to the rest of society .\nBut Trump knew that trickle-down doesn \u2019 t always happen .\nSo he made sure his tax cuts were the first in recent history to target the lower middle class \u2014 the working class .\nTrump signed a law giving a tax credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morris writes .\nMeanwhile , Biden and other Democrats will have to defend four years of record inflation , surging crime and increased illegal immigration at the southern border .\n\u201c Proving that Trump would do better ?\nThat one is easy .\nWe know that Trump would do better , because when he was president , he did do better , \u201d Morris said .\n\u201c Coming off four years of no inflation , little illegal immigration , and for the first three years of his term , little rise in crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 and will again \u2014 where Biden failed ?\nBiden can \u2019 t change his position .\nThe Democrats are stuck with their record of inflation , illegal immigration , and rising crime , and no amount of maneuvering or clever talking points can get them out of it.\n\u201d Morris said Trump has been vindicated by making America \u2019 s energy dependence from foreign oil a greater priority than the Democrats \u2019 push for climate change , with gas prices at nearly $ 5 a gallon at the pump .\n\u201c The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go to wind and solar energy .\nBut Trump pointed out that we have worked hard for forty years to be energy independent , \u201d he said .\n\u201c So why would we give that power away ?\nEspecially for solar panels that don \u2019 t work when it \u2019 s cloudy , and wind turbines that don \u2019 t turn on calm days .\nInstead , he said , let America be the OPEC of the future and use our energy power for democracy and human rights.\n\u201d He said America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAsked about Morris \u2019 book , Trump told The Post , \u201c I \u2019 ve known Dick Morris for a longtime and his father was a great real estate lawyer who represented me very well .\nDick is a very talented person , and I would ask for his advice and opinions on matters of politics .\nIt \u2019 s what he loves and does best , and he \u2019 s very good at it.\n\u201d Purchase The Return : Trump \u2019 s Big 2024 Comeback \u2014 CLICK HERE NOW !\nOn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Trump and the Republicans have a strong hand to play as the law-and-order party and paint Biden and the Democrats as soft on crime during the fall midterms and in 2024 .\nHe said the left wing of the Democratic Party \u2019 s campaign to defund the police is a gift to Trump and the GOP .\n\u201c The crime issue is particularly toxic for the Democrats , because it is obvious to voters that it was not nearly as bad a problem before Biden was elected .\nBack in 2019 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the headlines and faded in popular consciousness .\nBut after Biden \u2019 s election , the movement to defund the police , and the vilification of dedicated , responsible , fair , and hardworking police officers has set the crime rate soaring .\nSo who is to blame ?\nFigure it out !\n, \u201d Morris said .\n\u201c The Left wants to cut the number of uniformed police and replace them with social workers and psychologists to stem violence and escalation .\nSo the next time you worry that a criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , call 911 and wait for a social worker to arrive , \u201d he said .\n\u201c The Left \u2019 s goal is not to reduce crime by cutting the number of murders , rapes , and robberies .\nIt is to reduce punishment , incarceration , and harsh sentencing by decriminalizing crime.\n\u201d He said decriminalization of marijuana makes sense , but Democrats have gone overboard with policies such as eliminating cash bail .\n\u201c By meting out short sentences and allowing defendants to avoid showing up for trial without sanctions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequences of all criminal behavior \u2014 the decriminalization of crime !\nCrime and punishment are being replaced by crime and looking the other way , \u201d said Morris .\nBut Morris downplays the Jan. 6 , 2021 , riots at the Capitol building in the book , written before the recent revelations during congressional hearings about Trump \u2019 s role in the incitement of demonstrators .\nHe said the Democrats in Congress overplayed their hand by impeaching Trump over his supporters breaching the Capitol building .\n\u201c The conduct of the January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely the attempt at insurrection that the media reported , \u201d the Trump pal claims .\n\u201c There is a fiddling-while-Rome-burns quality to the hearings .\nMuch ado and much distraction about nothing .\nThe more attention the issue draws , the more it becomes apparent that the Democrats are not talking about the concerns that bedevil the average person \u2014 high prices and inflation at the pump , \u201d he said .\nMorris likened the Democrats \u2019 obsession with Trump and the Jan. 6 protests to Republicans in Congress moving to impeach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex scandal , which hurt the GOP in the 1998 midterm elections because voters thought they made a mountain out of a molehill .\nThe book also was written before the Supreme Court rulings that tossed out restrictions on concealed guns , overturned the federal right to abortion and scrapped executive power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions on power plants without congressional approval , which could galvanize Democrats to go to the polls .\n\u201c I do not think any of this term \u2019 s Supreme Court rulings will have an adverse effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Republicans in \u2019 22 or \u2019 24 , \u201d he said .\n\u201c The abortion decision has the most potential impact but , since state laws remain in force , the impact is largely theoretical and when people see how it works out they \u2019 ll see that very little has really changed.\n\u201d He said the court \u2019 s decision tossing out New York \u2019 s concealed gun carry law \u201c has to be viewed in the context of woke pro-criminal reforms like defunding police .\nPeople will see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government won \u2019 t protect us , we should have the right to protect ourselves.\n\u201d The court \u2019 s decision to restrict the president \u2019 s authority to impose environmental regulations to rein in pollution won \u2019 t hurt the GOP because \u201c the high gas prices have worn out the welcome \u201d of the greenies and \u201c taught the public the dangers of a blind obedience to their wishes.\n\u201d Morris did say Trump and the Republicans have to move on from claiming the 2020 election was stolen and advised them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail

Party .\nBut Donald Trump faced no real dissension in the Republican party and now is on track to win re-nomination in 2024 , perhaps almost unanimously .\nHenry Kissinger said \u201c a statesman \u2019 s task is to bridge the gap between his own vision and his nation \u2019 s experience .\nIf his vision gets too far ahead of his country \u2019 s experience , he loses his mandate but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional , he loses control of events , \u201d Nobody ever accused Donald Trump of being too close to the conventional and , as a result , he never lost control of events .\nThrough a major Russian hoax scandal , two impeachments , several government shutdowns , and endless congressional investigations , it was Donald Trump \u2019 s agenda that the country debated and Trump \u2019 s priorities that got adopted .\nDemocrats could not break the Republican ranks .\nThey made lots of noise but had little impact .\nTrump , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never lost \u2014 and still hasn \u2019 t lost \u2014 control of his own party as Johnson did .\nWhen he was defeated in the election of 2020 , maybe , it was not through an intra-party revolt despite the media \u2019 s endless efforts to foment one .\nThe Republican ranks held .\nBut Boris Johnson had no such good fortune .\nAfter he was elected , he fulfilled , in spectacular fashion and with incredible success his central mission of separating the UK from the EU .\nIn doing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round of socialism , the dysfunction that had laid it low in the post-World War II years until Margaret Thatcher liberated it .\nNow , in the guise of European unity , it was back , once again strangling the UK economy and stifling its initiative .\nBut after Johnson succeeded , he had nothing else to do .\nHe was unable to focus on an issue of similar magnitude .\nNo crusade animated his final years in office .\nHis was a caretaker government , a sharp contrast to Trump \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBecause of the lack of momentum in the Johnson Administration , his political immune system was weakened and compromised .\nSo , he succumbed to a variety of small scandals \u2014 opportunistic infections hyped in the media because Fleet Street had nothing else much to cover .\nHe mishandled the COVID crisis and violated his own quarantine rules .\nHe spent public funds on some possibly personal expenses .\nHe appointed a minister despite a prior charge of sexual harassment .\nBig deal .\nBut the Tory members of Parliament deserted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump .\nNothing has broken his base or his hold on his party .\nIn my new book , The Return : Trump \u2019 s Big 2024 Comeback , I predict that he will be re-nominated and re-elected with solid support from his own party and independents .\nBasically , not because his

"Hillary Clinton Will Run Against Trump Again It will be one of the great political re-matches of all time .\nHillary Clinton will run again for president in 2024 to stop Donald Trump .\nPurchase The Return : Trump \u2019 s Big 2024 Comeback \u2014 CLICK HERE NOW !\nIn fact , events are unfolding just as I predicted in my new book \u201c The Return : Trump \u2019 s Big 2024 Comeback.\n\u201d Increasingly , Democrats and big media like The New York Times know that Biden can \u2019 t run again in 2024 .\nI share some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own supporters say about Biden behind his back .\nIt \u2019 s pretty shocking .\nThese insiders know better than most that Biden \u2019 s quickly declining mental abilities , coupled with an economy spiraling out of control , means disaster for the Democrats in \u2019 24 .\nAlready they are bracing for a GOP tsunami this year , which will sweep Congress giving Republicans control of both the Senate and the House .\nAs I explain in \u201c The Return , \u201d the Democrats look at everything through a prism that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name is Donald Trump .\nThey fear Trump \u2013 and believe they must stop him at all costs .\nSo here \u2019 s what will happen : 1 .\nBiden will resist but ultimately have to cave to left-wing and media pressure and not run again .\n2 .\nThe Democrats also know Kamala Harris is also a disaster and can not be their candidate .\nTrump will easily defeat her .\n3 .\nThe Democrats , increasingly desperate , will search for a candidate who can both unite the party and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people like Calif. Gov .\nGavin Newsom , Colorado Governor Jared Polis , and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg .\n4 .\nWith Harris out , a Black candidate may emerge .\nThe short list here includes Sen. Cory Booker , D-N.J. , or , if she wins the Georgia governorship , Stacy Abrams .\n5 .\nThe far left \u201c progressive \u201d wing of the party will look to Bernie Sanders , Elizabeth Warren , or Alexandria Ocasio Cortez .\nAOC is the one who will take off , and she will wreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic Party .\nShe will do surprisingly well .\n6 .\nAs leftist candidates emerge as front-runners in the Democratic primary , pressure will grow on Hillary Clinton to enter the race .\nMuch like Biden \u2019 s surprise entrance in 2020 , Democrats will see her as their savior , an experienced politician able to bridge the left and more moderate wings of the party .\nIt is clear to me that Hillary \u2019 s recent spate of media interviews , as well as opinion pieces penned by long-time Clinton cronies touting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 are a prelude to her announcement she \u2019 s running .\nWhen that happens , we will enter a new phase .\nTrump is preparing for Hillary \u2019 s run \u2013 and knows he needs to create a new majority that will enable him to beat her and win in 2024 .\nAs I explain in \u201c The Return , \u201d it \u2019 s Trump \u2019 s to lose and he won \u2019 t .\nPurchase The Return : Trump \u2019 s Big 2024 Comeback \u2014 CLICK HERE NOW !\nGet Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Investment Material .\nNo Fee For Life IRA Program Now Available \u2014 CLICK HERE NOW !\nSUBSCRIBE TO RECEIVE DICK \u2019 S VIDEOS & COLUMNS FOR FREE \u2014 CLICK HERE !\nView Dick \u2019 s most recent videos in case you missed them !", "author": "Dick Morris", "url": "https://www.dickmorris.com/hillary-clinton-will-run-against-trump-again/", "published": "Tue, 19 Jul 2022 18:00:59 +0000", "published_utc": 1658268059, "collection_utc": 1658312696}, {"id": "dickmorrisblog--2022-07-20--Hillary Always Advances In Disguise \u2013 Lunch Alert!", "date": "2022-07-20", "source": "dickmorrisblog", "title": "Hillary Always Advances In Disguise \u2013 Lunch Alert!", "content": "Click Here to give me your thoughts and continue the discussion .\nPlease forward this email to any friends or @ @ @ @ @ in viewing my video .\nGet Your FREE , Gold And Silver Precious Metals Investment @ @ @ @ @ Life IRA Program Now Available \u2014 CLICK HERE NOW !\nSUBSCRIBE TO RECEIVE DICK \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ FREE \u2014 CLICK HERE !\nView Dick \u2019 s most recent videos in case you @ @ @", "author": "Dick Morris", "url": "https://www.dickmorris.com/hillary-always-advances-in-disguise-lunch-alert/", "published": "Wed, 20 Jul 2022 16:00:58 +0000", "published_utc": 1658347258, "collection_utc": 1658355875}, {"id": "dickmorrisblog--2022-07-21--The Truth About Climate Change \u2013 Lunch Alert!", "date": "2022-07-21", "source": "dickmorrisblog", "title": "The Truth About Climate Change \u2013 Lunch Alert!", "content": "Click Here to give me your thoughts and continue the discussion .\nPlease forward this email to any friends or @ @ @ @ @ in viewing my video .\nGet Your FREE , Gold And Silver Precious Metals Investment @ @ @ @ @ Life IRA Program Now Available \u2014 CLICK HERE NOW !\nSUBSCRIBE TO RECEIVE DICK \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ FREE \u2014 CLICK HERE !\nView Dick \u2019 s most recent videos in case you @ @ @", "author": "Dick Morris", "url": "https://www.dickmorris.com/the-truth-about-climate-change-lunch-alert/", "published": "Thu, 21 Jul 2022 11:00:13 +0000", "published_utc": 1658415613, "collection_utc": 1658442368}, {"id": "dickmorrisblog--2022-07-22--Chivalry: The Christian Response To Muslim Aggression \u2013 History Video!", "date": "2022-07-22", "source": "dickmorrisblog", "title": "Chivalry: The Christian Response To Muslim Aggression \u2013 History Video!", "content": "", "author": "Dick Morris", "url": "https://www.dickmorris.com/chivalry-the-christian-response-to-muslim-aggression-history-video/", "published": "Fri, 22 Jul 2022 18:00:32 +0000", "published_utc": 1658527232, "collection_utc": 1658528770}, {"id": "dickmorrisblog--2022-07-22--Michigan Dem.

Trump", "content": "There is a secret Democratic master plan to derail Donald Trump and prevent him from becoming president again .\nI explain this strategy in my new book : The Return : Trump \u2019 s Big 2024 Comeback .\nDemocrats have realized that they need to weaken Trump now to head off his efforts to run again .\nThey are using the January 6 committee to besmirch and weaken Trump and they are getting their media acolytes to promote potential Republican rivals of the former president .\nThe January sixth committee is trying to imply that Trump led an \u201c insurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reverse the results of the 2020 election .\nThey are really mirroring the tactic of communists who habitually blame the other side for doing the things they themselves are doing .\nHaving manipulated the results of the 2020 election by massive chicanery , they now accuse Trump of doing the same thing .\nBut even the most partisan Democrats must realize that they can do little to impair Trump \u2019 s popularity among his MAGA base .\nThe real purpose of the January 6 committee is to weaken Trump to attract rivals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perception of a diminished Trump whose momentum is dwindling , they hope to encourage other candidates in the Republican Party to enter the field .\nWhile the Committee proceeds with its nefarious work , the media publicizes every move of potential opponents of Trump .\nNo matter how anathema people like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis may be to Democrats , they are better than Trump and easier to beat .\nThe Republican party is blessed with a very deep bench of qualified candidates who may \u2014 at some point \u2014 run for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party that has people like Ron DeSantis , Ted Cruz , Josh Hawley , Nikki Hailey , Tom Cotton , and so many other talented candidates in reserve .\nBut the Democrats want to lure them into the 2024 presidential primaries now under the ancient Roman theory of divide and conquer .\nRepublicans must not fall into this trap .\nWe must not be inveigled into turning on one another and damaging our chances .\nThe stakes are too great to let infighting weaken us .\nAttractive potential candidates like Ron DeSantis must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic media and be tempted to challenge Donald Trump .\nIt would only serve the ends of the Democratic Party .\nSimilarly , well-meaning Republicans who fear that Trump \u2019 s personality might drive away supporters , must realize that , in casting about for alternatives to the former president , they are doing the bidding of the Democrats .\nLike him or not , Donald Trump is going to be the Republican candidate for president in 2024 if he chooses to run ( which he will ) .\nAnything that weakens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden and the Democrats from ruining America .\nWe do not have the luxury of being picky .\nTrump is the candidate we have got \u2014 and we are damn fortunate and blessed to have him .\nYou either help him or hurt him .\nAnd , in seeking a better candidate \u2014 although none exists \u2014 you are doing the Democrats a great big favor .\nWe all would do well to remember how , in 1980 , Ted Kennedy sapped President Jimmy Carter \u2019 s strength by putting him through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronald Reagan was elected president .\nOur Republican slogan should be : Unite !\nNo primary !\nDonald Trump for President !\nPurchase The Return :

feigned independence .\nBut she was conning us all along .\nShe was really holding out to fulfill a corrupt bargain with her richest supporters and major campaign donors .\nAt the expense of the average taxpayer , she held back her approval of the Democratic reconciliation package so her rich supporters could skate by paying minimal taxes .\nHer conduct was so odious that it makes even the Washington swamp look bad .\nHer goal was to preserve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers of hedge funds .\nThe Democrats had eliminated this loophole and Sinema , doing the bidding of her financial backers , refused to agree to the Democratic bill unless carried interest was restored .\nThis tax loophole costs the rest of us $ 14 billion and confers benefit on a few thousand very rich people .\nHedge fund investors who make investments that earn them money get to pay taxes on their winnings through the capital gains tax , usually paying only 20 % of their earnings , a tax break from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income where the rate tops out at 37 % .\nThey deserve this tax break .\nAfter all , they paid income tax on the money they invest so paying any tax at all on their winnings is really double taxation .\nBut at least they have only to pay 20 % not the full 37 % .\nBut those who work as managers of hedge funds typically invest no money of their own at all .\nThey are paid a straight salary by their hedge fund for managing the invested money .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ money is at risk , the \u201c carried interest \u201d tax loophole lets them pay only the capital gains tax rate rather than the rate on ordinary income .\nIt is a total giveaway and ripoff for the taxpayer .\nThese managers have not already paid taxes on their investments since they haven \u2019 t made any .\nTheir income should be in the same category as any other worker who is paid for his labor .\nThe carried interest loophole serves no public purpose and is a total payoff to a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sinema has lots of hedge fund managers in her state who likely give her massive amount of campaign money .\nAnd this is their quid pro quo .\nThat Sinema made such a stink about the deletion of carried interest that she used her power to withhold her vote so the entire package would fail to get the needed 50 votes in the Senate was a total outrage and she deserves to be called out for it .\nCarried interest has survived this long because it was protected by Senate Majority Leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With Wall Street in his state , Schumer said it was his duty to protect hedge fund managers , his constituents .\nBut this year , he gave in to pressure from the left of his party and went along with killing carried interest .\nHis sudden enlightenment was immediately offset by Sinema \u2019 s selfishness and corruption

covered the \u2019 22 primaries as if they were about Trump \u2019 s revenge on those who accepted the 2020 election results or voted to impeach him .\nEager for a horse race , they count up Trump \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pennant race .\nBut the fact is that Trump is really bringing his revolution to the innards of the Republican Party changing it forever and making it a working class party .\nTargeting RINOs and habitual losers , Trump is making his party anew and it is going to come out stronger than it ever was .\nSome fret that Trumps primary candidates may win their nominating contests but will do poorly in November against the Democrats .\nThis analysis is flawed because it does not realize that off-year elections are largely about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generating by getting rid of the established Republicans and electing a new breed will propel GOP voters to go to the polls .\nFor example , in Connecticut , the Republican Party is addicted to defeat .\nThey have gone from

in tomorrow \u2019 s Republican Senate Primary ( on August 9 ) .\nShe is no sacrificial lamb but a true conservative who puts America first and is on the path to defeating \u201c liar \u201d Dick Blumenthal who got elected by falsifying his Vietnam record .\nHe glorified his exploits but the fact is that he never set foot in Vietnam .\nPolls show that only 42 % of Connecticut likely voters

"Defund The New IRS Agents Next Year As if the Mar-a-Lago raid was not enough to doom the Democratic Party they are passing a bill this week hiring 80,000 new IRS agents to go through our garbage , spy on us , tap our phones , subpoena our bank accounts , monitor all our financial transactions , all with the goal of catching us in a lie on our tax returns and soaking us for back taxes , fines , penalties and even imprisonment .\nAnd the Democrats think this is popular !\nThey believe that the public is anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shrink the deficit and think they will approve of these tactics .\nOf course , they say that they are only aimed at rich people we all understand that the threshold of being rich drops down to the level of a limbo bar when the IRS is applying it .\nSo , what are the Republicans going to do ?\nThey can \u2019 t stop it from passing because it \u2019 s part of the reconciliation package but next year they can take bold action .\nHere \u2019 s what I propose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even just one \u2014 when the 2023-24 budget comes up for a vote in Congress , I believe that we Republicans should defund the extra IRS agents .\nStrike out the appropriation .\nThe reconciliation bill now passing is only an authorization .\nTo spend the money and hire the agents , they need an appropriation , and we can stop them .\nA simple majority will be enough to strike the appropriation because we will use the same reconciliation bill tactics that the Democrats used to hire them in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we in Congress will refuse to pass an appropriation bill that includes money for the IRS agents .\nA government shut down is inevitable .\nRepublicans are gun shy about government shutdowns because they \u2019 ve lost their shirts in four the last five .\nI oversaw Clinton \u2019 s attempts to be beat them when they shut down the government in 1995 and 1996 .\nBut this shut down will be over the specific hiring of the extra IRS agent and I think we Republicans will have the public solidly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win .\nThe agents will be defunded , and this threat will be lifted from our brows .\nPurchase The Return : Trump \u2019 s Big 2024 Comeback

devastating defeat in the Wyoming house primary into something , is considering running for president either in the Republican primary or as an independent .\nBut the key question is : if Cheney runs as an independent who will she hurt more Trump or the Democrats ?\nThe conventional wisdom is clear : if two Republicans are running \u2014 Trump and Cheney \u2013it benefits the Democrats .\nBut perhaps the conventional wisdom is flawed in this case .\nIs the polarization of opinions about Donald Trump such that the real division among voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versus anti-Trump ?\nIn that case having two anti-Trump candidates \u2013 the Democrat and Liz Cheney \u2013 would actually help split the never Trump vote and help elect Trump president .\nBut Cheney has an ulterior motive for running as an independent .\nIf she were to run as an independent , it would fit right in with the Democratic game plan to take Trump down .\nAs I stress in my book The Return , the Democrats know they can \u2019 t use the political process of elections to keep Donald Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year with Biden \u2019 s record staring in their faces .\nSo , they are bent on using the judicial system and the criminal justice system to take Trump out citing his ties to the January 6 mob and saying that he was leading an insurrection against the American government .\nThey hope this will trigger the 14th amendment prohibition against such candidates holding public office .\nBut they need a spokesman .\nThey need someone in the public light to make the case for disqualifying Trump on the grounds of sedition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t go on forever .\nIf Cheney runs as an independent , she gets a platform and a spotlight to continue to excoriate Trump and pedal the nutty fiction that he was that he was trying to overthrow the government .\nPart of the Democratic strategy is to use a Washington grand jury , packed with Democrats , to indict Trump possibly leading to his disqualification under the 14th amendment .\nLikely such an indictment would be tossed on appeal , but the Democrats hope that an indictment would knock Trump out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public will shrug its shoulders and blame any indictment on partisan overreach , just like they did with two impeachments that did not dent Trump \u2019 s popularity .\nHe \u2019 d still win and become the 47th President of the United States .\nPurchase The Return : Trump \u2019 s Big 2024 Comeback \u2014 CLICK HERE NOW !\nGet Your FREE , Gold And Silver Precious Metals Investment Material .\nNo Fee For Life IRA Program Now

After Judge\u2019s Ruling", "content": "A ray of light has burst forth from the chambers of U.S. District Court Judge Aileen M. Cannon making a Trump indictment very unlikely .\nAt last , we find a jurist with a real world understanding of the stakes involved and the meaning for the country of a possible criminal proceeding against the former president .\nUntil Judge Cannon \u2019 s ruling granting Trump \u2019 s lawyers \u2019 request for the appointment of a special master to review the documents seized in the Mar-a-Lago raid , I felt that the case was in the grip of bureaucrats who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in bringing any sense of proportionality to the controversy over the archives .\nHere we faced the possibility of a former president and a future candidate for president facing prosecution for what amounts to an overdue library book .\nThe Archives of the United States is , in essence , a library with some of the nation \u2019 s most important documents .\nBut , like most libraries , it is also cluttered with trivia .\nWe had been faced , before Judge Cannon spoke , with the possibility that some bureaucrat/librarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Justice Department to indict Donald Trump for failing to return documents to the library .\nNobody seems to have equated the potential punishment \u2014 catastrophic to our political system \u2014 with the largely record-keeping crime .\nBut then Judge Cannon proved that at least one judge had a proper sense of proportionality .\nShe wrote , of the possibility of a Trump indictment , quoting a previous court ruling that : \u201c A wrongful indictment is no laughing matter ; it often works a grievous , irreparable injury to the person indicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erased .\nIn the public mind , the blot on a man \u2019 s escutcheon , resulting from such a public accusation of wrongdoing , is seldom wiped out by a subsequent judgment of not guilty .\nFrequently , the public remembers the accusation , and still suspects guilt , even after an acquittal.\n\u201d And , because the stigma might fall on a former president , the judge wrote , \u201c It is in a league of its own .\nA future indictment , based to any degree on property that ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputational harm of a decidedly different order of magnitude.\n\u201d At last , we find a judge who grasps that all violations of the law are not equal and that it would be disproportionate and smack of judicial authoritarianism to indict a former president for the issues at stake in the Archive controversy , If there were any implication or accusation that President Trump had jeopardized the national security by mishandling the documents , it would be a different story .\nBut if his offense is that he consigned the documents to gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to the basement of the National Archives , is this worth a prosecution ?\nAn indictment ?\nThe repetitional damage to a former president and , perhaps a future presidential candidate , makes the only possible answer a resounding \u201c NO !\n\u201d Now that a judge has seen the issue in a perspective unavailable to the tunnel vision of the bureaucrats at the Archives and the politicians at the Department of Justice it appears likely that this cup will pass from our lips .\nPurchase The Return : Trump \u2019 s @ @ @

Presidents", "content": "The Tale Of Two Presidents Only once in our history have two presidents run against each other : In 1892 former President Grover Cleveland defeated President Benjamin Harrison for reelection .\nHarrison had defeated Cleveland in his predecessor \u2019 s re-election bid four years earlier .\nSo , inevitably the contest between Presidents Biden and Trump will revolve around a comparison of their respective records in office .\nBut this contrast would be a disaster for Biden that he can \u2019 t allow to happen .\nInflation , real income growth , job creation , border control , crime and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iranian , and North Korean imperialism were all incomparably better under Trump .\nSo , the Democrats have to go to Plan B : Vilify Trump as a person , attack his supporters , and change the race from President Trump versus President Biden to Donald versus Joe .\nThroughout his administration about 20 % of the American electorate said they approved of the job Trump was doing as president but disapproved of his personality and temperament .\nNow , in a bid for these swing voters , Biden hopes to make Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between their two presidencies .\nThe first step in his strategy was the raid at Mar-a-Lago , which put the former president squarely in the crosshairs of the FBI .\nThe second step was his speech last week in which he used his presidential podium to excoriate his predecessor personally .\nWhen Biden approached the podium to the strains of Hail to the Chief and stepped to the microphone to speak it was as if he were stepping into the ring of a SmackDown wrestling match .\nWhen he figuratively removed his presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare-knuckled brawler he is .\nThe presidentially came off with the robe as he began to deliver the most undignified and disgraceful performance by a president in recent history .\nStep three in Biden \u2019 s effort to get people to ignore the comparison of their presidential records will be the indictment of Donald Trump on the spacious grounds that he retains archive records in his basement .\nThis is rather like indicting somebody for having overdue library books .\nThe Archives are really just a library and the librarian \u2019 s nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t brought his books back .\nThere are no national security implications in the archives issue .\nNobody even alleges that Trump sent our data to our enemies .\nFor four years as president and two as former president he could \u2019 ve shared any of the secrets with Russia China or any other enemies but obviously didn \u2019 t do it .\nSo , we are left with a finicky librarian who wants his papers back and , for that , we are about to see a former president be indicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden \u2019 s strategy .\nGet everyone talking about Trump \u2019 s indictment so Joe can go on as one of the most failed presidents in history and still get four more years to do it again .\nPurchase The Return :

make Donald Trump the issue so as to deflect criticism of Biden \u2019 s record and to blunt how poorly it stacks up next to Trump \u2019 s .\nThe document raid was Act One in this unfolding strategy .\nThe disgusting and undignified Biden speech in Wilkes-Barre , PA was Act Two .\nSpeaking from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Inferno , he made the case that Trump and his supporters \u2014 all 75 million of them \u2014 were a threat to democracy and that they were using political violence to dominate our system .\nHis goal was simply distraction so that attention focuses on Trump \u2019 s personality and style rather than his \u2014 and Biden \u2019 s records .\nBut lurking behind these motivations may be a darker one \u2014 to hide and obfuscate evidence that the DOJ and the FBI let themselves be used as partisan instruments in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our democracy !\nPurchase The Return : Trump \u2019 s Big 2024 Comeback \u2014 CLICK HERE NOW !\nGet Your FREE , Gold And Silver Precious Metals

For President", "content": "In my new book , The Return : Trump \u2019 s Big 2024 Comeback , I predict Hillary Clinton will run for president in \u2019 24 and outline the steps that I think she \u2019 s going to take to set up her candidacy .\nDo I know Hillary or what ?\nEach day now she seems to be reading my book and following the game plan I outline just like she used to when I was working for her .\nBut don \u2019 t freak out !\nthis story ends with her losing to Trump by a lot !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Clinton and try to run for president in 2024 the same way he ran in 1992 .\nHer husband ran as the Democratic Party was recovering from shellshock after by the massive defeats of Walter Mondale and Mike Dukakis in the preceding years .\nBill capitalized on that bitter feeling of defeat by saying that he would move the Democratic Party back to the center and appeal to a new group of voters .\nHe enlisted my help in doing so .\nTo prove his moderation , he left the campaign trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sign a death warrant allowing the state \u2019 s first execution in decades .\nHe required teachers to take competency tests and fired those who failed .\nHe advocated building a wall on the southern border and in fact built almost 200 miles of it .\nHe more than doubled the number of deportations of illegal immigrants .\nAnd , in one of the most classic moments of campaign history , he criticized black activist and singer Sister Souljah for saying , after the Los Angeles riots of 1992 , \u201c If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why not have a week and kill white people ?\n\u201d Now , Hillary is looking to capitalize on the likely defeat the Democrats are facing in the coming Congressional elections as surely as Bill capitalized on Mondale \u2019 s and Dukakis \u2019 losses .\nTo position herself to do so , she is dropping comments that point to a moderating of her views such as her statement this week that the American people do not want open borders and her comment a few weeks ago that both parties should tone down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c semi fascists.\n\u201d She won \u2019 t make an overt move to run until after the Democrats lose the Congressional and Senate elections this year .\nAfter that wipe-out , party leaders will force Biden to withdraw from the 2024 race and announce that he will not seek re-election .\nUntil then , she \u2019 ll pose as a party loyalist who supports Biden and wouldn \u2019 t dream of running if he is in the race .\nBut , after he loses and announces that he \u2019 s not running again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a \u201c new Democrat \u201d just like Bill did saying that she represents the only way to free the party from the quagmire of defeat .\nOnce Biden is forced out of the race , the ultra-leftist candidates \u2014 like Bernie Sanders , California \u2019 s Governor Gavin Newsome , and even New York Congresswoman AOC will poll near the top of the heap in a Democratic primary field .\nParty stalwarts , fearful of a Trump return to office , will beg her to intercede and run for president just as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nShe \u2019 ll accede to their entreaties and run in the primaries as a moderate alternative .\nBut she \u2019 ll lose most of the primaries because the party \u2019 s base has moved so far to the left .\nHowever , the establishment will step in to rescue her by awarding her a disproportionate share of the appointed super delegates .\nIn November of 2024 , however , she will lose badly to Trump .\nThe worsening economy will seal the Democratic Party \u2019 s fate and her ongoing scandals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to haunt her .\nAnd Donald Trump will be the 47th \u2014 as well as the 45th \u2014 president of the United States .\nPurchase The Return : Trump \u2019 s Big 2024 Comeback \u2014 CLICK HERE NOW

Russia scandal ?\nThe phony charge that Trump was in cahoots with the Kremlin ?\nWell , in a huge development last week , we learned how the phony charge came to be created .\nUntil now , we thought that Hillary and her negative research team dreamed it up .\nBut now we learn that the FBI itself may have been the source of many of the completely inaccurate and made-up stories , accounts of

that Igor Danchenko , the Russian oligarch who was the main source that former British spy Christopher Steele tapped to compile his phony dossier of made-up charges against Trump , was actually a FBI

"content": "In 2021 , the American Association of Public Opinion Researchers reported that , in the 2020 election , our nation \u2019 s polling firms had their \u201c highest error rate in forty years.\n\u201d The Association found that the average poll conducted in the two weeks before Election Day , was wrong by 4.5 points , always in favor of Joe Biden .\nNow America \u2019 s polling firms are at it again .\nAn analysis by John McLaughlin of McLaughlin and Associates of recent Senate and governor polls reveals the same pro-Democratic bias in their results .\nIn Wisconsin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Ron Johnson is locked in a close race against radical progressive Democratic challenger Mandela Barnes , the most recent poll by Siena College found Barnes four points behind Johnson and , in the governor \u2019 s race , Democratic incumbent Tony Evers five points ahead of GOP challenger Tim Michaels .\nThe Wisconsin survey sampled five points more Democrats than Republicans , even though , in 2018 , the most recent Congressional election year , an equal number of Democrats and Republicans actually voted .\nSo , is Johnson narrowly winning by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality ?\nWe \u2019 ll see on election day .\nIn Ohio , its much the same story .\nThere , the Emerson Poll of 1,000 likely voters taken on Sept 13th , showed Republican JD Vance only four ahead of Democrat Tim Ryan .\nBut he \u2019 s likely further ahead .\nIn 2020 , Republicans accounted for eight points more of the voter turnout .\nBut Emerson \u2019 s poll only had one point more Republicans in its sample .\nSo , a race that everyone rates as a cliff-hanger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet .\nA September 12th Quinnipiac Poll in Georgia sent shock waves around the country when it showed Democratic Senator Rafael Warnock six points ahead of Republican Hershel Walker .\nBut , in this game , the scorekeeper may have gotten it wrong .\nQuinnipiac Poll included an equal number of Democrats and Republicans in its sample even though , in 2018 , five points more Republicans voted than Democrats .\nSo , the survey would appear to be too pro-Democrat by five points .\nAnd , understandably given the sample , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the gridiron star Hershel Walker actually winning or is he way behind ?\nThese pro-Democratic polls are not errors .\nThey are political bias intended to dry up donations for Republican candidates .\nTheir misleading information has succeeded in planting in the conventional wisdom a consensus that the Democrats have staged a comeback and powered by the abortion issue , are within striking

Association of Public Opinion Researchers reported that , in the 2020 election , our nation \u2019 s polling firms had their \u201c highest error rate in forty years.\n\u201d The Association found that the average poll conducted in the two weeks before Election Day , was wrong by 4.5 points , always in favor of Joe Biden .\nNow America \u2019 s polling firms are at it again .\nAn analysis by John McLaughlin of McLaughlin and Associates of recent Senate and governor polls reveals the same pro-Democratic bias in their results .\nIn Wisconsin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Ron Johnson is locked in a close race against radical progressive Democratic challenger Mandela Barnes , the most recent poll by Siena College found Barnes four points behind Johnson and , in the governor \u2019 s race , Democratic incumbent Tony Evers five points ahead of GOP challenger Tim Michaels .\nThe Wisconsin survey sampled five points more Democrats than Republicans , even though , in 2018 , the most recent Congressional election year , an equal number of Democrats and Republicans actually voted .\nSo , is Johnson narrowly winning by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality ?\nWe \u2019 ll see on election day .\nIn Ohio , its much the same story .\nThere , the Emerson Poll of 1,000 likely voters taken on Sept 13th , showed Republican JD Vance only four ahead of Democrat Tim Ryan .\nBut he \u2019 s likely further ahead .\nIn 2020 , Republicans accounted for eight points more of the voter turnout .\nBut Emerson \u2019 s poll only had one point more Republicans in its sample .\nSo , a race that everyone rates as a cliff-hanger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet .\nA September 12th Quinnipiac Poll in Georgia sent shock waves around the country when it showed Democratic Senator Rafael Warnock six points ahead of Republican Hershel Walker .\nBut , in this game , the scorekeeper may have gotten it wrong .\nQuinnipiac Poll included an equal number of Democrats and Republicans in its sample even though , in 2018 , five points more Republicans voted than Democrats .\nSo , the survey would appear to be too pro-Democrat by five points .\nAnd , understandably given the sample , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the gridiron star Hershel Walker actually winning or is he way behind ?\nThese pro-Democratic polls are not errors .\nThey are political bias intended to dry up donations for Republican candidates .\nTheir misleading information has succeeded in planting in the conventional wisdom a consensus that the Democrats have staged a comeback and powered by the abortion issue , are within striking distance of keeping Senate control .\nGet Your FREE , Gold And Silver Precious Metals Investment Material .\nNo Fee For Life IRA Program Now Available \u2014 CLICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 S VIDEOS & COLUMNS FOR FREE \u2014

Fears Trump Like Nothing Else", "content": "NY Case Proves Left Fears Trump Like Nothing Else We are about to find out if Donald Trump ever littered or jaywalked in his entire life .\nHe is under scrutiny for everything else with prosecutors throughout the country \u2014 all motivated by partisanship \u2014 filing all manner of lawsuits and criminal investigations against him .\nCould this have anything to do with his imminent announcement of his candidacy for reelection in 2024 ?\nOr with his dominance in the Republican party primaries this year ?\nOr with his lead over Biden in several national polls ?\nIf you answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re on the right track .\nIn my book , \u2018 The Return \u2019 , I predicted Trump would continue to rise in the polls and present an immense problem for Biden and the Democrats .\nI also warned the Democrats were preparing major legal hits against Trump .\nThe Mar-a-Lago raid was one .\nNow the latest attack on Trump is the new civil lawsuit against him and his family by the opportunistic New York attorney General Letitia James .\nThe charge against him is that he overestimated the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks .\nThe Letitia James lawsuit is particularly pernicious and vicious in that it goes after Trump \u2019 s children and family .\nConsider that Hunter Biden is walking around free , unmolested , and actually still doing business deals \u2013 as the Trump children face being dragged into court to testify , under oath , about the arcane details of their financial lives .\nObviously , Democratic prosecutors are trying to win in court what they think they can \u2019 t do at the ballot box come 2024 .\nLike so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central command , these prosecutors are deploying every resource to try to stop Donald Trump .\nThe height of his \u201c persecution by prosecution \u201c is the huge national crisis being fomented by the FBI because they claim he did not \u2014 in effect \u2014 return his library books on time .\nWere there the slightest evidence or even accusation that Trump betrayed national secrets or compromised national security in his handling of the archive documents , these allegations could be taken seriously .\nBut by simply asking what was in the documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are compelled to ask : Who cares ?\nIn four years as president and two years as former president there has never been one shred of evidence that Trump played fast and loose with our national secrets .\nThere \u2019 s no reason to assume that he did so now .\nBut none of these pinprick lawsuits and investigations will inhibit Trump from announcing for president .\nAnd as I explain in The Return , nor will they impede his chances any more than did all the previous charges , from Stormy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University students .\nIn the Archive scandal , the FBI is in more immediate danger than is Trump due to the revelation that the Bureau paid Igor Danchenko as an informant .\nAnd we know Danchenko concocted all manner of tall tales to frame Donald Trump in the phony Russia collusion scandal .\nA newly elected Republican Congress will likely blow the Bureau sky high as it investigates the Danchenko scandal .\nFor the rest of the garbage charges , Trump will be overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from an outraged public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Return lays out the plan .\nPurchase

Pennsylvania ( Dr. Oz ) , and Georgia ( Hershel Walker ) .\nMOW \u2019 em down !\nIt all comes down to these three crucial races .\nIn Ohio , JD Vance , and in North Carolina , Budd , are also close but ahead .\nSo , for God \u2019 s sake ( literally ) .\nPlease get out your credit card and make donations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 25 , $ 50 , $ 100 .\nSmall donors are the key to their success All of them are being outspent on media by 3:1 or 4:1 by their Democratic rivals .\nThey are parsing out their TV budgets , knowing they need more , but not able to afford it .\nAll are behind right now .\nAnd we must win them all .\nBlake Masters won his debate by a smackdown this past Thursday .\nHe made Democratic incumbent Mark Kelly pay for his vote against hiring 16,000 new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 87,000 new IRS agents .\nBut the highlight of the debate was his victory on abortion .\nAbortion !\nEver since he Dobbs decision , the Democrats have gained over the issue , closing the lead Republicans initially amassed due to Biden \u2019 s terrible policies .\nIn this debate , however , Masters found the Master Key to winning the issue .\nAfter Kelly launched a full-scale attack on him for denying women abortions , Masters pointed out that he favored allowing abortions in cases of rape , incest , or danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also said he supported the just passed Arizona law allowing them , for any reason , within the first fifteen weeks of pregnancy .\nHis reply left Kelly with nothing to say .\nAnd then came his counter punch : That Kelly was an abortion extremist for his support for abortions up to the date of delivery where \u201c we are talking about a live baby .\nThen , the moderator moved in for the kill and asked Masters if he thought Biden was an illegitimate president and if he believed Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expecting Masters to hem himself in by admitting to being an \u201c election denier.\n\u201d But Blake slipped the punch and said that if the Intel agencies had not dishonestly claimed that the Hunter Biden laptop was \u201c Russian disinformation , \u201d Trump would have , indeed , won .\nWe don \u2019 t know yet the impact of the debate but Masters entered the duel six points back and likely pulled even .\nPlease Donate To Blake Masters For Senate \u2014 CLICK HERE !\nDr. Oz likely trails John Fetterman by single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has been catching up steadily as Oz attacks Fetterman over the crime rate \u2014 homicides are up 37 % \u2014 and his votes to pardon dozens of murderers .\nThe crime issue has probably closed the gap .\nAnd now Oz is pivoting to inflation and the economy .\nThis focus will , I think , give him a lead .\nBut he is hurting over abortion in the face of Fetterman \u2019 s withering attacks on the issue .\nHe needs to run an ad saying that he doesn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows abortions up to the 24th week ( halfway ) .\nIf he doesn \u2019 t do so , he will continue to bleed votes over abortion .\nBut he can \u2019 t afford both to attack on inflation an defend on abortion .\nThat \u2019 s why he desperately needs your help right now .\nPlease Donate To Dr. Oz For Senate \u2014 CLICK HERE !\nPolls had

come out that the woman is not someone Walker met in the locker room , but is the mother of his other child .\nShe just did not want more children and the Democrats acted as if paying for her abortion was the crime of the century .\nBut , as Churchill said , \u201c a lie can make it halfway around the world while the truth is getting its shoes on in the morning.\n\u201d That \u2019 s why Walker needs your donations .\nWarnock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran a summer camp at which children were being abused and , when state inspectors came to investigate , he denied them access and was arrested for

A Republican Surge", "content": "Even as fears have mounted among Republicans that the storied \u201c red wave \u201d they had anticipated is ebbing , October brings good news : The Red Wave is back !\nThe temporary cloud cast over Republican chances by the Dobbs decision appears to be dissipating , allowing the basic GOP surge that I predicted in my new book , The Return : Donald Trump \u2019 s Big 2024 Comeback , to manifest itself .\nThe generic ballot ( \u201c all things being equal do you plan to vote for the Democratic or Republican candidate for Congress in your district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rasmussen , seven points in the GOP \u2019 s favor , a three-point gain since last week .\nSuch a margin indicates a big Republican win \u2014 upwards of thirty seats .\nShould the Republican advantage continue to grow \u2014 as it likely will \u2014 the margin could approach wipeout status .\nGenerally , in a midterm election , partisan preferences grow stronger as the voting approaches .\nThe abortion issue that animated the Democratic surge over the summer , appears to be fading .\nThree factors I believe the count for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the prospect of higher energy prices due to the OPEC production cut .\n\u2022 The Democrats may have peaked too soon on the issue gaining in August as opposed to October .\n\u2022 The Republicans have learned how to handle the issue by embracing current law in their state and pledging not to change it .\nIn most states , current law allows abortions in case of rape , life of the mother , and very early in pregnancy .\nThe Republican surge is animated by decisive debate victories on Friday in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Michigan ( Governor ) , and Wisconsin ( Governor ) .\nGeorgia had been trending Democrat before the debate under the weight of Hershel Walker \u2019 s scandals , but likely no more .\nTudor Dixon , the Republican candidate for Governor of Michigan , seemed like a hopeless case , but now , on the strength of a decisive win in her debate with incumbent Democrat Gretchen Whitmer the race seems winnable .\nThe Republican Governor \u2019 s Association , after waiting to commit , now is pumping millions into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s surge , former president Obama has announced plans to campaign against her in Michigan .\nAnd , in Wisconsin , Republican Tim Michaels clearly defeated a largely passive and obviously aging Democratic governor Tony Evers .\nWalker was supposed to lose the debate because , as a football hero , he \u2019 s not necessarily very articulate .\nComing up against an experienced pastor , Senator Raphael Warnock \u2019 s chances seemed dim .\nBut Walker surprised everyone with a strong performance .\nWhatever the issue he pivoted to bring it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on abortion he indicated new flexibility and backed it in cases of rape or a danger to the life of the mother .\nBut , above all he seemed to have mastered his new trade of politics and was able to spar with the best of them .\nThe most important debate will come next week in Pennsylvania Senate race between Dr. Oz and stroke-impaired John Fetterman on October 25th .\nFetterman won \u2019 t release his medical records and recent on camera interviews indicate that he mispronounces words and can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is printed out in front of him .\nWhatever his medical prognosis , he can not recover from his radical positions on pardoning and releasing one in three Pennsylvania prison inmates and on defunding the police .\nOther than the Oz-Fetterman race , we now lead in all contests for seats currently held by the Republicans .\nNorth Carolina is close but Ted Budd holds a consistent lead .\nAnd , despite a less than stellar debate performance , JD Vance is ahead in Ohio .\nIf the Republicans win the Oz race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of GOP Senators .\nSo , we would need at least one pickup .\nAdam Laxalt , the Republican candidate in Nevada , has led in every poll .\nBeyond that pickup , the chances of Walker in Georgia and Masters in Arizona look increasingly bright .\nAnd there are long shots for Smiley in Washington State , Levy in Connecticut , and O \u2019 Dea in Colorado that are polling well .\nSo strong is the Republican tide that President Biden is going to deep blue Oregon to campaign in the governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State , Republican Lee Zeldin is coming on strong as well .\nHe is running an ad pledging not to change the New York abortion law , eliminating Democratic governor Kathy Hochul \u2019 s best issue .\nThe message is : If you are a Republican , whatever

?\nIs the Republican Party , in its own inimitable fashion about to blow this election ?\nWith the House in their pockets and the Senate within reach , the GOP may have figured out a way to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory .\nAnd their possible defeat would come from making the same mistake twice !\nRemember how , in 2020 , the Democrats piled up huge leads among those who voted early , sometimes weeks before election day , while .\nRepublican operatives wrote ads and conducted polls and generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn to election day to get out their vote .\nBy the time the Republicans showed up , the Democrats had already piled up leads that were insurmountable through early voting .\nWhile the Democrats went door-to-door to sign up their voters , Republicans sat back and waited .\nIt \u2019 s like in baseball , when one team scratches out runs through walks , singles , stolen bases and sacrifice flies while the other team waits for the three-run homer that never comes .\nYou would have thought that the Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut now , in 2022 , the same thing is happening .\nAs of today , October 23rd , 7,460,000 people have already voted , 1.67 million in person one 5.8 million by mail .\nAnd , in states that register voters by party , 2.1 million of these early voters have been Democrats ( 50 % ) while only 1.2 million have been cast by Republicans ( 30 % ) .\nPolling by John McLaughlin , John Jordan , and me shows that , in Pennsylvania , 14 % of Fetterman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one percent of Oz supporters .\nIn Arizona , twice as many of Democrat Kelly \u2019 s voters have already voted \u2014 10 % \u2014 as opposed to only 5 % of Republican Masters \u2019 supporters .\nThe central message of my new book The Return : Trump \u2019 s Big 2024 Comeback is that the Republican Party must change its political tactics to match the new rules Democrats unveiled in 2020 .\nIt matters very much when a person votes .\nWhen Democrats ask a voter to cast his ballot two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow up if he doesn \u2019 t come through with two or three or even ten visits to remind him .\nBut with election day voters , there is no margin for error .\nIf even five percent of Republican voters don \u2019 t show up , because the kids got sick , things piled up , the flu , or just too many things to do , the Party risks losing Senate races that are now on razor edge in Arizona , Pennsylvania , Georgia , Nevada , North Carolina , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Senate or even the House .\nSo , why are the Republicans living so dangerously ?\nScarred by their 2020 experience , they worry that early votes for Republicans will be lost or misplaced .\nThese worries about voter fraud are strong enough to get them to urge their devoted followers to stay home and only come out only on Election Day .\nHow shortsighted can you get ?\nNone of us can foretell the future , certainly in our own lives , and guarantee that in two weeks the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to vote no matter what .\nWho can make that kind of prediction , especially with the life of the country hanging in the balance ?\nThe answer is to provide sufficient ballot protection through volunteer poll watchers , not to let the voters stay home .\nTwo days after we were defeated in the election of 2020 campaign manager Jared Kushner called to boast to me : \u201c Boy did we sure did a great job on Election Day.\n\u201d He was right .\nTrump pulled out 11 million more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , by using early voting , Biden pulled out 15 million more .\nSure , we need to stop

primary for the 2024 nomination \u2014 while Trump has a free pass to the GOP nod \u2014 is more than the Fake News media can tolerate .\nSo now , the fake news is resorting to its ultimate invention : fomenting a primary between Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump .\nThe nominal basis for their speculation is a joke the president told at his rally three days ago describing the Florida governor as Ron \u201c DeSanctimonious \u201d .\nThis was no more than Trump being Trump , giving vent to a cute joke at the expense of a fellow politician .\nTrump no more intends to stir up a battle with DeSantis

Democrats did far more damage .\nHow can we expect to win when we fail to fund our candidates ?\nSo many of us were armchair warriors , decrying President Joe Biden \u2019 s policies but not reaching deep enough into our own wallets to put our money where our mouths were .\n2 .\nWe did not get out the early vote .\nAs I pointed out in my book , The Return : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not afford to let the Democrats pile up votes in October and even in September and wait for a massive Election Day turnout to bail us out .\nHow could we have expected Oz to win when early voting left him behind by 700,000 votes to 100,000 ?\nMany of our voters refused to vote early by mail because they were afraid that their votes would be \u201c misplaced \u201d by fraudulent Democrats .\nBut they didn \u2019

the Democratic game by casting early votes ourselves .\nHow can we expect our candidates to make up deficits of hundreds of thousands of votes before polls open ?\nWe all know people who planned to vote on Election Day but did not .\nThe kids got sick , work piled up , the day went by too fast .\nFor Democrats , no problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so with Republicans who wait for Election Day , for whom there is no tomorrow .\n3 .\nIf there is one man to blame for the Senate failures in 2022 , it is Minority Leader Mitch McConnell .\nActing out of a combination of personal pique and political opportunism , he gutted too many of our candidates because he feared they would not back him for majority leader .\nBy trash-talking and withholding funding , he made it next to impossible for Blake Masters to win in Arizona , Oz to prevail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hampshire and Leora Levy to defeat Blumenthal in Connecticut .\nHis obstinacy also made it harder for Herschel Walker in Georgia , Ted Budd in North Carolina , J.D .\nVance in Ohio and Ron Johnson in Wisconsin .\nIn the meantime , his PAC spent millions for Lisa Murkowski , whose opponent was a Republican .\nHe appealed for donations saying that his PAC was where to give to stop Biden \u2019 s senators .\nBut McConnell was determined that Trump \u2019 s Senate candidates would not win so they would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for majority leader .\nAnd he may have succeeded only in electing himself minority leader again .\nIn Donald Trump , we have a unique candidate for 2024 .\nHe is a hybrid candidate \u2014 part challenger and part incumbent .\nAs a challenger , he can attack Biden \u2019 s record and make bold promises for the future .\nAnd as a part-incumbent , he can show that he always delivers on his promises .\nHow do we know DeSantis can create jobs while holding down inflation ?\nWith Trump , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do we know DeSantis can persuade Mexico to hold potential illegal immigrants south of the border ?\nWith Trump , we know .\nHow do we know DeSantis can stand up to Russia , China , Iran and North Korea ?\nWith Trump , we know .\nDon \u2019 t throw away the best president we Republicans have had since

\u2013 The GOP Did Not Lose The Midterms", "content": "Don \u2019 t Let The Media Con You \u2013 The GOP Did Not Lose The Midterms One of the biggest media hoaxes is that the Republicans lost the midterm elections\u2026and that it was a sign voters are tiring of Donald Trump .\nThe Republican candidates for the House got 52,690,787 votes while Democrats only got 48,096,016 votes \u2014 almost a 5 million-vote Republican majority .\nThis margin of victory , against the backdrop of President Joe Biden \u2019 s 7.1 million-vote defeat of Trump in 2020 , indicates a 12-million vote shift between 2020 and 2022 , the largest gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections going back to before 2000 .\nWe entered the 2022 elections with 22 seats to defend in the Senate , including six vacancies .\nThe Democrats only had to defend 11 seats and had only one vacancy .\nDespite those odds , Republicans held all but one of their seats .\nThe only defeat we suffered was at the hands of our own expectations .\nAnd none of it was Trump \u2019 s fault .\nThe Republican victory in the popular vote in the House shows that the Senate losses were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of local defeats in specific states more likely due to bad and underfunded campaigns than to Trump .\nIndeed , the pattern suggests that Mitch McConnell \u2019 s decision not to fund Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania , Don Bolduc in New Hampshire and Blake Masters in Arizona was the main culprit in their losses .\nThe main tactical reason for the Senate defeats was the Democrats \u2019 advantage in early voting combined with their control of Election Day machinery .\nIn Pennsylvania , for example , Democrats had banked a 300,000-vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polls even opened .\nSuch a handicap was almost impossible to overcome , especially with the Democratic secretary of state gladly tolerating machine breakdowns that lengthened lines around the block on Election Day .\nIn Arizona , where the Democratic candidate for governor , Katie Hobbs , controlled voting as secretary of state , machine breakdowns led to long lines on Election Day .\n4,500 Arizona voters signed in at polling places but did not vote , turned off by the hours-long wait to cast ballots .\nTens of thousands more likely saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept driving .\nThese lines did not do much to tamp down Democratic votes \u2014 they had voted early \u2014 but sapped GOP turnout .\nWhy didn \u2019 t Republicans vote early ?\nWe were too stupid .\nFrightened by the prospect of voter fraud , our people would not mail in their ballots .\nAnd too ingrained in the Election Day voting habit , they didn \u2019 t take advantage of in-person early voting either .\nThis kind of suppression of our vote played a key role in our Senate defeats .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscured , likely deliberately , by the absurd delay in vote counting .\nBut 2022 was one of the best years for Republican House candidates ever , so don \u2019 t let the media con you into

Washington Times Op-Ed that Trump \u2019 s \u201c electoral map is shrinking \u201d in the wake of the November 8th Congressional election results .\nHe claims , due to Republican defeats in key states , that \u201c Georgia could be off the table for Mr. Trump \u201d and that Arizona \u201c may no longer be in play \u201d for the former president .\nHe adds that Pennsylvania is \u201c likely a much heavier lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basing his doomsday worries on Republican Senate defeats in two of the three states .\nBut Senate races are particularly susceptible to flawed and underfunded campaigns .\nWalker was outspent 2:1 in the Georgia Senate race while Republican Arizona Senate candidate Blake Masters was outspent by upwards of 4:1 .\nAnd , in Pennsylvania , John Fetterman spent tens of millions more than his GOP opponent Dr. Oz .\nDid this gross disparity in funding ( in part the result of Mitch McConnell \u2019 s near-sighted refusal to fund pro-Trump candidates ) have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed Trump unpopularity ?\nTo determine how much underfunding contributed to these Senate defeats ( as opposed to a Trump drag on the ticket ) , let look at the House race results .\nAfter all , the 435 House contests , taken together , are the only real national results to study in the 2022 contests since every district in every state , not just certain ones , was in play .\nArizona ?\nRepublican federal House candidates got 1,323,000 votes while their Democratic opponents won only 1,003,000 .\nIn Georgia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 2,043,942 \u2014 1,873,650 .\nAnd in Pennsylvania , Republicans got 2,692,000 votes to Democrats \u2019 2.418,000 .\nTrump was obviously a key factor in all these races , but Democratic out-spending of their rivals was much less pronounced in House than in Senate races .\nNationally , how toxic could the Trump brand be when Republicans won 53 million votes for their House candidates while Democrats only managed 48 million ?\nTrump \u2019 s Republican Party got 5 points more votes the House races of 2022 having lost the popular vote in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turnaround is the greatest two-year performance since the 1990s .\nDespite the evidence of Trump triumphs in House races , Democrats and fellow-traveling RINO Republicans are quick to worry that the former president will drag us down in 2024 .\nThey are quick to advise us that Trump \u2019 s time has passed and that we should turn the page to run Ron DeSantis instead .\nBut this data reveals the flaw in letting the other party decide who we should run

Americans Are Immune From Inflation Question : Why was inflation not more of an issue in the recent election ?\nWhy did Democrats escape a lot of the blame for sky-high price hikes ?\nAnswer : Because the Democrats made sure that 37 % of the American people did not feel full impact of inflation .\nTheir government benefits or their private incomes included cost-of-living adjustments and other protections against rising prices .\nThe elderly and those on fixed incomes typically feel the impact of inflation most severely .\nBut cost-of-living adjustments , ( called COLAs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inflation .\nEven though prices rose by nine percent in 2022 , their incomes also rose by 9 % at the end of the year .\nWhile the elderly blanched at rising prices throughout the year and had to lay out money to pay for them over the months of 2022 , at the end of the year , a few weeks before the election , they got big fat checks from the Social Security Administration reimbursing them for inflation .\nOther federal benefits are also indexed for inflation such as disability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicaid reimbursement .\nThese core Democratic constituencies did not feel the inflation of 2022 nearly as much as the rest of us did and , as a direct result , didn \u2019 t vote to turn out their Democratic benefactors .\nLikewise with unionized private sector worker , most of whom were protected by COLAs , also saw that their paychecks were shielded from inflation .\nIn fact , we begin to understand more easily why the Democrats found inflation to be not much of a problem and , indeed , may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other 63 % of Americans , without COLA protection , were left awash in a deep sea of inflation .\nBut the Democratic Party took care of its own affording islands of protection , through cost of living adjustments .\nThe worse inflation became , the more valuable the COLAS were .\nIndeed , many of these constituencies came to celebrate inflation as their benefits rose at year \u2019 s end .\nWhat damage inflation inflicted on the US economy !\nSavings shrank , productivity was imperiled , investments were distorted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the Democrats felt no pain from big spending , growing deficits , and a crushing national debt .\nLike a dentist \u2019 s patients who , on Novocaine , do not feel his drill , they happily benefited from government spending and borrowing with no pain .\nThere was no political incentive to curb inflation and even some incentive to accelerate it .\nThe analysis below , generously provided by Rick Manning and Robert Romano of Americans for Limited Government , shows how widespread COLAs are throughout government benefits .\nInformation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who received Cost of Living Adjustments : There are 57 million seniors but about 52.7 million collect Social Security and Medicare , which include COLA adjustments .\nAnother 5.6 million are either early retirees or young survivors who also collect Social Security .\nThere are also 89.9 million Americans who receive Medicaid that also includes COLAs , but 6.4 million are seniors and also included in the above 54 million , and 40.9 million are children in CHIP and so are not of voting age .\nThe remaining 42.6 million are adults , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SNAP beneficiaries get COLAs too but they appear to be a subset of the Medicaid population ( individuals tend to receive both , for example 89 percent of SNAP children also get Medicaid ) .\nThat said , another 1.6 million children collect SNAP but don \u2019 t have Medicaid .\nThere are also 12 million who receive Social Security because of a disability but they are most likely on Medicaid with the disability waiver , too , so no need to count them twice .\nThere is the possibility of Social Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disability waiver , but it won \u2019 t change the bottom line by that much .\nBottom Line : there are 99.6 million adults who are some form of public assistance that get COLAs as a part of the benefit .\nIf you include children who are also on COLA-based programs , the number rises to 137.8 million .\nThere are still some overlaps not accounted for here ( for example early retirees who might have collected Medicaid too but that would be very rare ) but I think that \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that constitutes about 37 percent of the working age population that receive COLA-adjusted public assistance .\n( See Here : https : //data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU00000000 ) Purchase The Return : Trump \u2019 s Big 2024 Comeback \u2014 CLICK HERE NOW !\nGet Your FREE , Gold And

.\nTrump \u2019 s lead over DeSantis has grown from 18 points in early December to 23 points now .\nPlus , the most recent Mclaughlin Poll shows Trump three points ahead of Biden in a general election

reality has set in and has exposed how fatuous his promises were .\nIndeed , the administration has been exposed for falsely saying that it created 1 million new jobs when the actual figure turns out to be only 10,000 .\nOn the heels of this disappointment , Biden \u2019 s rating has crashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 39 % approval , the lowest of his presidency .\nMeanwhile , Trump has been through a firestorm of negative publicity including the myth that he was somehow repudiated in the \u2019 22 election , the narrow loss in the Georgia runoff , the phony story about hosting a white supremacist for dinner , and his misinterpreted comments about \u201c terminating \u201d the constitution .\nThrough all this , his ratings are up , and everybody else \u2019 s are down .\nSo , get a late

"This month , scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory announced they had achieved energy gain in a fusion reaction for the first time in history .\nThe gain occurred for a split second and the energy produced was only greater than that in the lasers used to trigger the reaction , and not the total electrical energy use to power the system , but it was truly \u201c one small step for man and one giant leap for mankind.\n\u201d Nuclear fusion \u2014 how God powers the sun and the stars \u2014 is a limitless energy source that does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planet \u2019 s temperature or pose a danger to world peace .\nThe New York Times writes : \u201c When researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California announced last week that they had achieved the first controlled nuclear fusion reaction to produce more energy than it took to start , they brought humanity one step closer to the decades-long dream of harnessing the power of the sun \u2014 not by absorbing its rays from 93 million miles away , as solar panels do , but by igniting , in effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times explains : \u201c Like fission , the nuclear reaction that powers today \u2019 s nuclear plants , fusion produces emissions-free electricity , but without the long-lived toxic byproducts or risk of catastrophic accidents.\n\u201d It also \u201c yields several times more energy by weight than fission and millions of times more than the combustion of fossil fuels : A few paper clips \u2019 worth of reactants ( isotopes of hydrogen , the most abundant element in the universe ) could produce enough energy for a person \u2019 s lifetime.\n\u201d Nuclear fusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitting that it was successfully demonstrated two weeks before the anniversary of our divine salvation in Jesus \u2019 birth .\n\u2022 Fusion will eliminate the need for the wrenching economic and social changes that ending fossil fuel electricity will cause .\n\u2022 It will end the power of oil and natural gas , that has enabled a new form of imperialism by giving Russia and Iran and Saudi Arabia the power to hold the world hostage .\nEnergy will no longer be a scarce resource to be defended \u2014 or conquered \u2014 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectancy by avoiding the necessity of producing the toxic fumes we all inhale .\nPrometheus stole the gift of fire from theta mankind gods and brought it to man .\nHe was punished , the ancient Greeks wrote , by being bound to a rock while his body was attacked each day by a giant eagle .\nThe scientists at Livermore face no such risk , but their gain is as profound .\nFor fusion to happen on Earth , the NY Times notes , \u201c fuel has to be heated to more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotter than the core of the sun \u2014 which poses extraordinary engineering challenges.\n\u201d The scientists at Livermore bombarded a tiny pellet of fuel with an arsenal of the world \u2019 s most powerful lasers .\nReplicated on Earth to generate unlimited energy .\nOne scientist said , \u201c Sometime in the next decade or two , we are going to build the first commercial fusion reactor and then humans are going to spend the next 10 million years building better fusion reactors because fusion is really just an amazing energy source , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extremely cheap .\n.\n.\nyou can build it anywhere and scale infinitely.\n\u201d Purchase The

starts his 2024 campaign .\nBut two serendipitous events have come to his rescue and dumped two potent issues in his lap : the Twitter file expose and the big spending , budget-busting omnibus bill Senator Mitch McConnell let the Democrats pass , effectively disempowering the new Republican House majority .\nTwo great issues to ride : Free speech and fighting McConnell .\nBoth issues strike deeply responsive chords with Republican and Independent voters \u2014 deep enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomination , regardless of what DeSantis decides to do .\nThe Twitter/FBI free speech issue gives Trump the unique status of victim-in-chief of the greatest government effort to fix and rig a presidential election in our history .\nForget Maricopa County , Fulton County , Philadelphia or Milwaukee , the fraud that rigged the 2020 election occurred when the FBI and Twitter suppressed and discredited convincing evidence , on Hunter \u2019 s laptop , that the Biden family was in bed with the Chinese Communist Party .\nHad this information come out two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no way Biden could have won .\nIt did come out but was buried beneath the well-planned efforts of the FBI to discredit and denigrate it as Russian disinformation , so the mainstream media felt able to ignore and even suppress the story .\nAs the main victim of this blatant attempt to muzzle free speech and use government funds and personnel to fix and rig an election , Donald Trump has unique standing to address the issue .\nHis putative rival for the nomination , Florida Governor Ron DeSantis , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relegated to the sidelines as this battle plays out .\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell gave Trump his second Christmas present ; A bloated , pork-laden budget bill passed even as the Democrats saw the Republican moving vans headed to Washington to take over the House .\nLike Vietnamese boat people or anti-Taliban Afghanis , the Democrats are clinging to their rafts or airplane skids to pass one last spending bill before the Republicans arrive .\nThanks to McConnell \u2019 s green light , the lame duck Congress passed one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 1.76 trillion travesty filled with every earmark a congressman could want .\nThis spending bill passed with support from RINO Republicans like Mitt Romney but also with the votes of GOP senators slated to retire in a few weeks .\nWith one foot out the door , they left a legacy of inflation-inducing spending in their wake .\nMcConnell is becoming a curse word among Republicans for letting it pass as he threw away his leverage by agreeing to raise the debt limit through 2024 .\nMcConnell \u2019 s craven surrender makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the primaries of 2024 for senate and inevitably for president as well .\nFrom now on , you are either for McConnell or for Trump .\nA feud has now become a central policy division in the GOP , dividing the establishment \u2014 fat and happy to share in the spoils of spending \u2013against the grassroots , the former Tea Party Movement , determined to rein in government and contain inflation .\nIn this battle , as well , DeSantis can only root from the sidelines , even as he hesitates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIndeed , Florida benefited from almost $ 300 million of earmarks in the Omnibus Spending Bill .\nWill he turn it down ?\nOrder his counties to refuse the pork ?\nMeanwhile , Donald Trump has two great issues to ride : free speech and McConnell .\nAnd DeSantis is left behind .\nPurchase The Return : Trump \u2019 s Big 2024 Comeback \u2014 CLICK HERE NOW !\nGet Your FREE , Gold

has assured that his 2024 Senate candidates will have to survive primary fights against determined and outraged conservatives backed , encouraged , and partially funded by Donald Trump .\nRight now , McConnell himself is insulated from the vengeance of conservative voters until 2026 by his six-year term , largely assured by Trump \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the ten Republican Senators who must run in 2024 have no such protection .\nNor do the potential Republican challengers to the 23 Democrats and Independents up for re-election in 2024 .\nIf they back McConnell and defend his support of Biden

primaries .\nIf DeSantis challenges Trump in the presidential primary of 2024 , he will have to choose to be for Mitch McConnell or against him .\nIf he chooses to ally with the Kentucky Senator , he won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative base against Trump .\nAnd if he chooses to oppose McConnell , he will sacrifice a lot of potential financial backing from McConnell \u2019 s people .\nDamned if he does
