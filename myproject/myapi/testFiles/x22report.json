for this article was to see if it was possible to find the connection between the four main \u201c battles \u201d waged against Trump .\nWe all assumed they were connected , but my goal was to specifically find out how .\nThese are the 4 main \u201c battles \u201d I considered : As I was looking at each of the above from a 40,000 ft view , a specific name kept showing up .\nThat name is David Rubenstein , one of the co-founders of The Carlyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you .\nBefore we do a deep dive into Mr. Rubenstein himself , I \u2019 d like to discuss the company he co-founded , The Carlyle Group .\nThe first thing that struck me was how The Carlyle Group used political relationships for financial gain .\nNote that while Obama was President , Carlyle became the largest private equity firm by capital raised over previous five years .\nThose political relationships were not bound by a mere party label , either .\nHere is some of The Carlyle Group investments .\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as very odd .\nTo recap with a brief timeline : \u2022 October , 1997 \u2013 Carlyle acquires United Defense Industries for $ 850 million , their largest investment to that point .\n\u2022 September 11 , 2001 \u2013 Carlyle holds their investor conference , naming one investor , Shafiq Bin Laden , as their \u201c guest of honor.\n\u201d Note the Bin Laden family had invested $ 2 million into the \u201c Carlyle Partners II Fund.\n\u201d I \u2019 ll be coming back to that fund again later .\n\u2022 September 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks leading the United States into the \u201c War on Terror.\n\u201d \u2022 December , 2001 \u2013 Carlyle completes an IPO of United Defense on the NYSE .\n\u2022 May , 2005 \u2013 Carlyle sells UDI to BAE for $ 4 Billion .\nCarlyle Profits nearly $ 3.2 billion with the sale .\nthe Alwaleed connection is interesting .\nIn May of 2017 , Donald Trump made his first official foreign trip as President to visit Saudi Arabia , and in early November of 2017 , Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal was arrested for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1983 and they were divorced in December of 2017 .\nAlice has her own interesting connections .\nAlice also hosted Barack Obama in August of 2015 : Before we get back to more of David Rubenstein , let \u2019 s do a brief summary of what we have learned so far : \u2022 Carlyle group has a few \u201c shady \u201d but relevant ( to our story ) investors ( Soros & Alwaleed ) \u2022 Carlyle group has an optics \u201c problem \u201d ( United Defense investment and 9/11 ) \u2022 Rubenstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghislane Maxwell \u2022 Rubenstein \u2019 s ex wife hosted Barack Obama for a private dinner in 2015 It \u2019 s now important to take a look at the long list of David Rubenstein \u2019 s affiliations where we start to see some familiar left wing organizations come into the picture : Before digging into the above organizations , there is one advisory board Rubenstein is on that for some reason isn \u2019 t listed above .\nIt can instead be found in his bio on The Carlyle Group \u2019 s website : Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 2015 Advisory Board meeting at Tsinghua University : Just so we \u2019 re clear , David Rubenstein chairs an advisory board for Tsinghua University in China .\nThis is the university that Xi Jinping graduated from and is the premier training university for future leaders of the CCP .\nThis connection is massive .\nWe will touch on it again when we discuss the Covid-19 pandemic and Rubenstein \u2019 s connection to it .\nThe picture below was taken in October 23 , 2013 .\nRubenstein also has a few ties to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife Alice Rogoff and her own connection to Ghislane Maxwell ) .\nFirst , both Rubenstein and Epstein were members of the Trilateral Commission .\nThere is also this story from the Mockingbird Paper outlining an Epstein connection to the Carlyle Group through Les Wexner .", "author": "x22report", "url":

March 1 , news broke that Hunter Biden \u2019 s longtime business partner and friend Devon Archer was sentenced to a year in federal prison for defrauding a Native American tribe .\n\u2022 Attorney

evidence proves that Mr. Biden intended to violate FARA , which the government must prove in order to secure a criminal conviction .\n\u2022 I think that misstates the law .\nTo support a FARA conviction against Hunter Biden , the DOJ would only need to prove : \u2022 That Hunter Biden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a foreign government ; \u2022 That Hunter Biden failed to notify the U.S. Attorney General that he was acting as an agent of a foreign government ( before said action took place ) ; and \u2022 That Hunter Biden knowingly agreed to operated within the U.S. subject to the direction or

The battle over documents and e-mails in the Michael Sussmann case just got hotter .\n\u2022 Back in August 2017 , Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee , explaining how his firm was retained to gather \u201c lots of facts about Donald Trump.\n\u201d He admitted that Fusion GPS met with reporters leading up to the 2016 election to spread opposition research against then-candidate Trump .\n\u2022 Now the stories have changed .\n\u2022 Fusion GPS is no longer an opposition research firm , and they weren \u2019 t hired to dig-up dirt against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you believe , after the phony dossier and the Alfa Bank hoax , that Fusion GPS was retained to provide legal advice to the Hillary Clinton Campaign .\nRemarkable .\n\u2022 there were flurry of filings from interested entities in the Sussmann case , seeking to intervene to petition the court to keep these emails and documents secret .\nThe DNC , Rodney Joffe , Perkins Coie , and Hillary for America all filed motions to intervene and memorandums in opposition to Durham \u2019 s motion to compel .\n\u2022 Notably , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GPS wasn \u2019 t retained for opposition research .\nHillary for America , for example , asserted \u201c attorney-client privilege and work product protection over communications and work product of its attorneys ( at Perkins Coie ) and their consultant ( Fusion GPS ) .\n\u201d In support of that motion , Hillary for America included declarations from John Podesta , Robby Mook , and their attorney , Marc Elias .\nDeclarations which contradict the public record .\n\u2022 John Podesta declared that to his knowledge , Perkins Coie has \u201c consistently maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perkins Coie ( Sussmann in particular ) assisted in distributing to the press the materials and allegations prepared by Fusion GPS and other researchers .\nCompare Podesta \u2019 s declaration to Sussmann \u2019 s December 2017 testimony ( h/t FoiaFan ) : Not to be outdone , Robby Mook ( Hillary \u2019 s campaign manager ) told the court that he believed that contractors for Perkins Coie \u2013 which would include Fusion GPS \u2013 were providing \u201c legal services and legal advice \u201d to the Clinton campaign .\nUnfortunately for Hillary for America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purposes of privilege .\nClinton lawyer Mark Elias also submitted a declaration , stating the role of Fusion GPS was to \u201c provide consulting services in support of the legal advice \u201d Perkins Coie and Elias were providing their clients .\nThis contradicts the Elias \u2019 s own statements cited above .\nFusion GPS , in its filing today , made similar arguments : \u201c Elias retained Fusion to expressly support his legal advice .\n.\n.\nand the retention specifically contemplated the need for such advice for potential and ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fusion GPS , which previously refused to produce correspondence in the Alfa Bank ( Fridman , et al . )\ncase .\nHaving already produced thousands of pages of materials requested by grand jury subpoenas , they \u2019 re all desperate to keep these remaining records secret .\nWe can \u2019 t help but think the information is damaging .\nHow damaging might it be ?\nDamaging enough for this fight .\nWe also can \u2019 t help but believe Hillary for America , Fusion GPS , Sussmann , and the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these records secret .\nHere \u2019 s a quick rundown of why ( Durham \u2019 s motion to compel goes into more detail on the legal arguments , if you \u2019 re curious ) Durham will likely get these documents and e-mails : \u2022 The actual work was political , not legal .\n\u2022 Fusion GPS shared its findings with the U.S. government and the press ( related to # 1 ) .\n\u2022 The \u201c privilege \u201d was always a pretext .", "author": "x22report", "url": "https://x22report.com/hrc-panics-all-assets-deployed-how-is-evidence-legally-introduced-we-have-it-all-ep-2756/", "published":

that the Christchurch shooter did !\nWe \u2019 ve got the hash marks : We also have the \u201c 14 \u201d and the \u201c Fish \u201d symbol used on both guns .\nThe number 14 is somewhat commonly used in Neo-Nazi circles , and it also has meaning within the Illuminati cultists too .\nYou might be familiar with the infamous photo of John Podesta with the 14/Fish symbolism written on his palms

Ten Percent to Fifteen , Three Predictable Problems Will Surface Soon \u2022 Last Friday the Biden administration raised the mandatory amount of biofuel , specifically ethanol , that must be blended within the U.S. gasoline supply .\nThe previous amount of 10 % was raised to 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EPA ) .\nThis is likely to lead to two sets of bigger issues , less food and higher gas prices .\n\u2022 \u2666 First issue .\n\u2013 The Renewable Fuel Standard ( RFS ) is a government mandate , passed in 2005 and expanded in 2007 , that requires growing volumes of biofuels to be blended into U.S. transportation fuels like gasoline and diesel every year .\nApproximately 40 percent of corn grown in the U.S. is used for ethanol .\nRaising the amount of ethanol required in gasoline will result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nWith farming costs and outputs already under pressure this could be problematic .\n\u2022 \u2666 Second issue \u2013 The EPA enforces the biofuel standard by requiring refineries to submit purchase credits ( known as Renewable Identification Numbers , or RINs ) to the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) proving the purchases .\nThis enforcement requirement sets up a system where the RIN credits are bought and sold by small refineries who do not have the infrastructure to do the blending process .\nThey purchase second-hand RIN credits from parties that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets up a secondary income stream , a trading market for the larger oil companies , refineries and importers .\n\u2022 The RIN credit trading platform is similar to what we might expect to see if the \u2018 Carbon Trading \u2019 scheme was ever put into place .\nHowever , now that the biofuel requirements for blended gasoline have gone from 10 % to 15 % , the price of the RIN credits will likely jump .\nThis will cost refineries billions in additional expenses , \u2026 .\nwhich will mean the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase , \u2026.. which will mean the cost of the gasoline at the pump will go higher .\n\u2022 \u2666 Third Issue \u2013 \u201c Ethanol is a valuable source of octane in finished gasoline , but it is chemically different than petroleum gasoline and can not be used in concentrations above 10 percent in small engines \u2014 like outboard boat motors , motorcycles , lawnmowers , generators or chain saws \u2014 or in any cars made before 2001 .\nComplicating matters further , most cars on the road today still aren \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 10 percent ethanol .\nRetail stations also must have compatible infrastructure in order to sell gasoline with higher ethanol blends.\n\u201d This issue is known within the industry as \u201c The Blend Wall.\n\u201d \u2022 The net result of Joe Biden \u2019 s EPA raising the mandatory amount of biofuel that must be present in the U.S. gas supply is this : \u2022 ( 1 ) Less food as more corn is needed for ethanol .\n\u2022 ( 3 ) Vehicle engines breaking down at a much higher rate .\n\u2022 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Hillary for America , the DNC , Fusion GPS and other parties will make frivolous and unsubstantiated claims of attorney-client privilege in attempts to defy federal grand jury subpoenas .\nAny such claims these same litigants advance in future cases as they attempt to thwart subpoenas by making this same claim is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already established record they lie about this , and so future judges will be granting Durham any in camera reviews he requests .\n\u2022 Durham established there was a coordinated joint venture between the DNC , HFA , Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS to create fake Trump/Russia collusion hoaxes that were then to be given to federal agencies to get the Trump campaign targeted for law enforcement and intelligence investigations .\nOnce a successful handoff of a hoax was accomplished , the Clinton campaign would then orchestrate a media leaking campaign publicizing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targets of federal investigations .\nDurham established all of this on the record .\n\u2022 Durham established via sworn testimony that not only was Hillary Clinton aware her campaign was manufacturing fake Trump/Russia hoaxes , she gave her own personal approval to move ahead and give these hoaxes to the news media .\nShe and her campaign left a social media record behind them after the hoaxes were given to the FBI , calling attention to the hoaxes and raising their visibility as a way to affect the 2016 presidential campaign .\n\u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealing classified/nonpublic data off of federal agency databases and using the stolen data to construct these hoaxes .\nAnd the Clinton campaign was paying for it all .\nThe FEC even fined the Clinton campaign and the DNC for trying to hide the payments for the hoaxes by laundering the payments for the dirty tricks operation through their Perkins Coie law firm .\n[ There \u2019 s been a fantastic new plot twist to this point # 4 , which I \u2019 ll be addressing in a minute ! ]\n\u2022 As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @

because the law says if a person is raped the abortion is allowed .\nthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEED to cross state lines from Ohio to Indiana b/c state law in Ohio allows for the rape exception .\nThe minor

issued by Obama .\nIn order to understand the significance of these amendments , we need to fully understand what Executive Order 13618 entails so we know what is actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on here is that during national security and emergency situations , such as those that would cause a continuity of government situation , there were numerous entities involved in carrying out the responsibilities for secure communication .\nExecutive Order 13618 essentially provided for every single agency in our government to play a role in secure communication during emergency situations .\n13618 even goes on to say \u201c All agencies \u201d : Now that we know Executive Order 13618 is all about , let \u2019 s look at how it was actually amended by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is important .\nInstead of using an interagency policy process to make recommendations to the President with respect to the use of authorities assigned to the President under the Communications Act of 1934 , the FMR EO set things up to outright delegate the President \u2019 s authority to the Director of the OSTP \u201c if the President takes the actions , including issuing any necessary proclamations and findings , required by that section to invoke those authorities.\n\u201d This executive order is once again referencing the war powers of the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaim a state of war , the FMR Executive Order triggers the delegation of authority to take over priority communications , suspend or amend rules relating to certain emission stations or devices , suspend rules and regulations regarding wire communications , close any facilities deemed necessary , and/or have the government take over the use of any such facility , station , or apparatus as described .\nThey would have the legal authority to essentially take over any and all forms of communications required .\nIf President Trump and his FMR Executive Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government plan like devolution , they would need to be able to securely communicate as the operation unfolds .\nThe first step he took to ensure they had proper communication was to delegate his authority to direct such use of the secure communications networks .\nNot only did this executive order delegate authority to prioritize defense and security communications , but it also consolidated involvement away from all those extra agencies and placed it solely within the Federal Mission Resilience Executive Committee .\nSo the same Committee that is implementing and executing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access , and responsibility to perform the National Security and Emergency Preparedness communications .\nObama \u2019 s EO 13618 created a process for emergency communication involving all sorts of red-tape through deep state agencies and Trump shred that order to pieces and consolidated it into the hands of those implementing and executing the devolution plan .", "author": "x22report", "url":

will gushingly report that \u2013 soon !\n\u2013 you \u2019 ll be able to do it in less than 15 minutes .\nWhat they never tell you is that you can not do this at home .\nBecause private homes do not have the capability to \u201c fast \u201d charge an EeeeeeVeeeee .\nThe very \u201c fastest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private home is in around eight-nine hours , on a 240 volt ( dryer-type ) outlet .\n\u2022 You will never be able to \u201c fast \u201d charge an EeeeeeeeeVeeeee at home .\nNot without completely rewiring the home to commercial-grade capacity .\nThis means you will always have to drive to wherever the \u201c fast \u201d charger is \u2013 and wait there .\nThis means spending time getting to ( and from ) the \u201c fast \u201d charger .\nWhich means spending more time \u201c fast \u201d

about ?\nThey do not tell you that while it might be \u201c faster \u201d it is less .\nAs in , not a full recharge .\nJust enough to get going again .\nBut not very far \u2013 before you \u2019 ll need to stop ( and wait ) again .\nThe farther you drive , the shorter the service life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limit of its range , you will have heavily discharged its battery pack .\nIf you want the battery pack to last you should avoid doing this , because regularly discharging a battery is likely to reduce the life of the battery .\nMeaning , its capacity to hold the charge ( and so , deliver the range ) it advertised when new .\nThis is why hybrid cars are designed to always keep the battery partially charged .\nEven so , a hybrid car \u2019 s battery pack eventually loses its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced .\nIf you don \u2019 t have a garage , where will you plug in your EeeeeeeeeeVeeeeeee ?\nWill you be able to run an extension cord from inside your house \u2013 or apartment \u2013 to wherever the EeeeeeeeVeeeeee is parked ?\nDid you know that leaving an EeeeeeeeeeVeeeeeee garaged outside \u2013 in the cold \u2013 will result in the EeeeeeeeeeeVeeeeeee \u2019 s range when you parked it being less when you get up the next day to drive it ?\nThis is because EeeeeeeeeeeeeVeeeeeees burn power even when they aren \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powered heating ( and cooling ) systems that are always on \u2013 to keep the battery from getting too cold ( or too hot ) .\nThat means needing to keep the EeeeeeeeeeeVeeeeeeee plugged in , to avoid loss of charge while it \u2019 s just sitting \u2013 especially if it is sitting outside , in the cold ( or heat ) .\nFinally \u2013 for those who are considering an EeeeeeeeeeeeeVeeeeeee because they believe that they are thereby reducing their \u201c carbon footprint \u201d : You are probably increasing it .\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not last as long as non-EeeeeeeeeeVeeeeees \u2013 because EeeeeeeeeeeVeeeeeeee battery packs do not last as long as non-EeeeeeeeeeeVeeeees do and cost more than it \u2019 s worth to replace them when they can no longer power the EeeeeeeeVeeeee .\nThat means a new EeeeeeeeeeeeVeeeeeeeeee sooner .\nWhich means new raw materials ( and carbon dioxide \u201c emissions \u201d ) to make the new EeeeeeeeeeVeeeeee \u2013 which will be just as prematurely disposable as the old EeeeeeeeeeVeeeeee .\nTwo , because EeeeeeeeeeeVeeeeeeees are energy hogs .\nEven the small ones like the Tesla 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a Honda Civic sedan \u2013 has more than 1,000 pounds of battery pack , which it uses to deliver the speedy 0-60 times it touts .\nBut that entails a probable doubling of the size of the battery pack that would otherwise be needed to deliver adequate ( rather than \u201c ludicrous \u201d ) speed \u2013 and also uses twice ( or more ) the power needed to keep it charged up .\nAlmost all of that power \u2013 especially the commercial-grade power available at \u201c fast \u201d chargers \u2013

"If you are the opponents of Donald Trump you must be thinking what in the heck is going on ?\nDoes this man not understand the word former ?\nCarter , Reagan , Bush Sr , Clinton , Bush Jr , Obama\u2026.every single one of them eventually faded publicly , some a little more than others but for the most part they checked out .\nDonald Trump is anything but checked out .\nIn fact , you get the sense he is everywhere all at the same time .\nHe \u2019 s issuing statements left and right on every conceivable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , borders , endorsements , and a host of other topics .\nWe \u2019 re talking about a former President who has one more rally coming up in the next week after just completing his 26th since the 2020 election .\nThis guy seems like he is everywhere still to this very day .\nIs this how a former President conducts himself ?\nWhen I think of Donald J. Trump the last word that comes to mind is former .\nRegardless of your position on his actual status politically there is no arguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But why is he doing this ?\nAnd I am not looking for all the common answers : \u2022 Because the election was stolen \u2022 Because the real insurrection was November 3rd , 2020 \u2022 Because the commies are trying to take over I get it .\nAll those things are true and I don \u2019 t want to diminish the importance of any of them .\nBut none of those statements answer that one simple question .\nWhy is he doing this ?\nHe is doing this because there was , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nJust watch , look , and listen .\nIn my recent 6 part Substack series Flight 1745 we cover a range of happenings within the Donald Trump geo-political sphere that will either confirm your suspicions , enhance you understanding , or flat out surprise you in ways that are both encouraging and thought provoking .\nOften times we spend so many cycles on what \u2018 they \u2019 did when we should be spending far more time on what is being done right before our eyes by what the history books will call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 .\nAnd don \u2019 t kid yourself .\nThat is precisely what we are experiencing , a \u2018 Trump Era \u2019 .\nThe definition around era is open to interpretation , but for example purposes let \u2019 s say it \u2019 s 10 or more years .\nI believe the Trump era when all is said and done will likely have lasted from 2015-2030 .\nFrom the moment he came down the escalator until at least 2 years into the term of whomever follows him after he leaves office at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new administration is often a reflection of both the incoming and outgoing administration and the current administration is a picture perfect example .\nI am quite sure that even many democrats are looking back at the first Trump term with ever-growing fondness .\n\u201c Another type of war , new in its intensity , ancient in its origin , that would require a whole new kind of strategy , a wholly different kind of force , forces which are too unconventional to be called conventional forces.\n\u201d When I heard those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ezra Cohen-Watnick I knew then and there something was up .\nNo incoming Active Secretary of Defense for Intelligence gives a \u2018 vision \u2019 speech of that magnitude knowing good and well he will only serve for 2 months .\nNothing about what took place between November 3rd , 2020 and January 20th , 2021 was conventional .\nWe had the entire spectrum of events from high-level DOD personnel changes , a fake insurrection , alternate electors , and a fake inauguration .\nBut there \u2019 s the scene on the stage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common mistake in trying to understand Donald Trump is misconstruing what is coming out of his mouth with what is actually taking place .\nThere are far too many evil actors out for blood for him to even consider telegraphing his next move , even if it \u2019 s a source of frustration for folks like you and I .\nIn constructing a good plan it is important to surround yourself with individuals that are bought into the plan , even if it means they eventually play a role that shows them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That \u2019 s right .\nYou have to be willing to play the role of the loyalist as well as the betrayer .\nHaving a circle of folks to play these various roles is critically important .\nBecause in order to win Trump would have to create the consistent illusion of mass chaos and convince most everyone that the left hand had no idea what the right hand was doing .\nIn this series we \u2019 ll see that was far from the case .\nWe look into the role of 9 individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrative but the actual events that have us on the brink of generational victories .\nSome of the faces will be familiar but a few may make you pause and wonder why .\nFor those familiar with my \u2018 Flight 1745 \u2019 Substack series you will be seeing largely new information in this 3 part series with small amounts of re-coverage for contextual purposes only .\nThe difference being is that in this series our focus will be on understanding this idea of an OmniPresidency and it \u2019 s impact .\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the list but for this series , here are the 9 key players .\nAs we approach what appears to be the inevitability of a second dose of Donald Trump you \u2019 ll see a framework that was put together and the key decisions that were made along the way .\nThese decisions consistently have the Trump fingerprints on them and in some cases even though he may not have been directly involved you still get the sense he was .\nThe two we \u2019 ll start with in this issue are Larry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ll give a brief profile for each .\nLarry Ellison is the co-founder of the Oracle Corporation , and he was also the company \u2019 s CEO until September 2014 when he stepped down but remained on as CTO and remains so today .\nOver nearly a 40 year span , Oracle has become an incredibly successful tech company , now employing over 136,000 people .\nOracle is all about data and database that can operate at a scale that not even the federal government can rival .\nLarry Ellison is 4th on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America and as most everyone knows , Oracle and Larry Ellison are big supporters of President Trump .\nEzra Cohen-Watnick is an American intelligence official who served as the acting under secretary of defense for intelligence during the Trump Administration .\nHe previously served as the acting assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict , national security adviser to the United States attorney general and as a former senior director for intelligence programs for the United States National Security Council ( NSC ) .\nCurrently , he is adjunct fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy as well as the chair of the Public Interest Declassification Board where he was appointed by Trump and continues to serve under Biden ) .\nSo why start with these two ?\nI believe Larry and Ezra are undeniably linked .\nBelow are 3 facts about events that took place in sequential order by month .\nSo yes , it is significant that Ezra was fired from the NSC , hired by Larry Ellison and Oracle , and then the first Q post appears .\nBut having worked in technology for over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Q technology platform was this : Why is it that this Q message board was never able to be brought down ?\nEven to this day some 2 years into a Biden presidency why do we still have a completely secure and active Q message board ?\nWouldn \u2019 t it be ridiculously easy with the resources of the CIA , NSA , and CISA to take down this message board tomorrow if they so chose ?\nThe answer is of course yes , it would be very easy .\nYou and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing the Biden administration wanted more than for that stupid Q message board to go away but they can \u2019 t make it go away no matter how hard they try .\nI contend the reason for that is because it sits behind enterprise level firewalls and data encryption that not even foreign state actors with sophisticated threat technology could even begin to penetrate .\nBut something that flew under the radar with the firing of Ezra from the NSC was the fact that this was actually a second if not a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at this excerpt from the Atlantic which was published on July 23 , 2017 ( 9 days before his firing ) .\nSo this brings to mind another key question .\nWhy would Trump block the firing of Ezra in March only to approve it in August ?\nWhat happened between March and August that suddenly swung the pendulum against keeping Ezra on ?\nActually , that wasn \u2019 t the case at all .\nThis was a simple case of Trump not being done using Ezra .\nThe services of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPhase 1 was making sure Devin Nunes had the goods he needed to begin spinning up the \u2018 spying \u2019 narrative that was so critical to the success of the overall plan .\nBecause remember , it was March 22 , 2017 that Nunes had the impromptu press conference where he claimed he had seen evidence that communications between President Donald Trump and members of his transition team were \u201c incidentally collected \u201d during surveillance operations of foreign targets .\nAnd then on Thursday afternoon , March 29 , 2017 it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for intelligence Ezra Cohen-Watnick and White House national security lawyer Michael Ellis provided Nunes the intelligence documents , indicating a direct thread between the administration and the original news conference .\nAt his daily press briefing , Press Secretary Sean Spicer declines to comment , saying he chooses to focus more on the \u201c substance \u201d than the \u201c process.\n\u201d So McMaster had it out for Ezra and wanted him gone much earlier than August but that was not going to happen so Trump blocked the initial firing .\nPhase 2 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ezra in August ) was the handoff of Ezra to Oracle in September .\nEzra would report to Safra Catz ( CEO ) and Larry Ellison ( CTO ) .\nFor some context without getting too far into the weeds here are a few headlines and sources that underscore the history of mutual support between Trump and Oracle .\n\u2022 Oracle and Ellison offer software to White House to study hydroxychloroquine \u2013 New York Times Article Let \u2019 s say you were a guy in your mid-30s with no background whatsoever in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be practical or even possible that you would land a director position reporting directly to the CEO of the largest software database company in the world ?\nThat is not a \u2018 until you an land on your feet again \u2019 job but rather a title that was planned .\nWhat Ezra started doing during that late 2017 timeframe was quite significant in my estimation .\nIn fact , 2017 wasn \u2019 t the first time that Larry and Ezra would cross paths .\nIf you fast forward to November of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news again at almost precisely the same time related to the exact same subject\u2026..the election of 2020 ( Phase 3 ) .\nThis only makes sense when you begin to understand the deep ties between Donald J. Trump and Larry Ellison which I detailed out over my various other articles on Substack .\nBut sometimes the dead giveaway can come straight from the enemies camp and in this case it was the Washington Post who also reported on the November 2020 call that Larry Ellison participated in but they brought up some critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out otherwise .\nRead this excerpt\u2026.. ( remember , this was never meant to be revealed and ONLY came out to the public as part of legal discovery related to an entirely different case ) .\n\u2022 It is the first known example of a technology industry titan joining powerful figures in conservative politics , media and law to strategize about Trump \u2019 s post-loss options .\n\u2022 Eshelman asks , \u201c Why was he on call with Senator Graham ?\nIs he part of the data/analysis solution , is he a potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second point is key .\nEshelman is not talking about shots in the dark .\nHe \u2019 s talking about a solution that appeared to already exist .\nA couple final points to round things out .\nThere is zero chance ( and I mean zero ) that Larry Ellison ( 4th richest man in America ) is going to participate in a phone call about overturning a U.S. Presidential Election unless he already knew what the end result would eventually be .\nWhen Larry hired Ezra back in 2017 there was likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my free Substack series .\nThe goal was not only to catch the steal but to prevent any future theft from even being a possibility .\nI have contended for quite some time that the activity that was taking place between September of 2017 and November of 2020 was perhaps the most consequential period that may forever fly under the radar\u2026.which is just as well .\nLarry and Ezra were participating in their slice of the OmniPresidency where the end is already known from the beginning .\nWell , if they had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so the election could be overturned ?\nBecause it was never meant to be overturned\u2026.at least not yet .\nDonald Trump was and is in the midst of something that will make his 2016 victory look like a junior high class treasurer election by comparison .\nOnly in retrospect will any of us truly appreciate it .\nDon \u2019 t let your personal frustrations cloud the much bigger picture of what is taking place .\nIt \u2019 s tough work correcting the past while simultaneously forging the path ahead .\nBesides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are talking about a guy that trademarked the phrase \u2018 Make America Great Again \u2019 just a few days after Romney lost to Obama .\nThat \u2019 s right .\nBack in 2012 .\n( Washington Post Article ) .\nLike Churchill before him , the future will end up being kind to Donald Trump\u2026.because he intends to write it .",

seeing the worst paycut in 25 years under Biden .\n\u2022 The New York Post reported on real wage destruction under Biden : Americans battered by soaring inflation since President Biden took office have effectively suffered the steepest pay cut in a quarter-century , according to data released by the Federal Reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dallas published new findings that calculated \u201c real wages

viewed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valid .\nBelieving in this theory earlier led to the deplatforming of many prominent people , including legitimate , respected doctors .\n\u2022 And this is just what \u2019 s happening on social media .\nWhat happens when your money is censored ?\n\u2022 Look no further than the Canadian trucker protest that took place in early 2022 .\nThe Canadian government sought to require vaccination of every trucker that entered its country .\nAt the sight of this obvious intrusion of human rights , the truckers decided to protest the mandate by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by blockading the

Benjamin Harrison declared \u201c Columbus Day \u201d as a one-time celebration the following year to honor the contributions of Italians and Italian Americans in the United States .\n\u2022 President

particular moments in our history where rules for certain events are unwritten and have helped so many presidents expand their powers , leading some to wonder precisely how wide-ranging presidential

exercise greater control was over events and not people .\nDid you catch that ?\nControl over events and not people .\nThis is why President Trump can successfully make his impact felt long after he has left office .\nBut as is always the case , various formal and informal checks , developed over time that have curbed some presidential efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the shifting strength of

limitations as well .\nSome examples are , presidents had relatively short terms , had to get re-elected , and they could be impeached .\nBut what the framers could not possibly have foreseen was the

control than the framers could have imagined .\nIt \u2019 s important to understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama or Biden with a pen in their hand versus Donald Trump .\nIt can be summarized in one word .\nTime .\nI have a 3-phrase combination I use often , as I believe it does a good job of summarizing the Trump framework of operation .\nAs the midterm elections approach all the chatter is about weather \u2018 they \u2019 re going steal this or that \u2019 .\nThe various narrative battles rage over Durham and his role , mass arrests vs. plea bargains , varying views on COG ( continuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case may be .\nBut as I have said for the better part of a year the plan is in execution and has been for at least 6 full years now so this idea that Trump is \u2018 reacting \u2019 to anything is a long distant thought .\nThe collective enemy is the only one that has been reacting and continues to do so .\nTrump has done and continues to do his part .\nOur part is very simple , vote and do so with a smile because you should be .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ important as those that cast them .\nPay close attention .\nThis is a pretty amazing and largely untold end-to-end story .\nThe Department of Commerce v. New York from 2019 was a case decided by the Supreme Court dealing with the 2020 United States Census .\nThe case revolved around the decision of the United States Census Bureau under the Trump administration to include a question asking whether respondents are United States citizens or not on the standard census questionnaire sent to all households .\nSuch a question had been purposely omitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials and sociologists widely fear it would reduce participation in the census .\nIt has been used on the \u201c long form \u201d American Community Survey sent to a subset of households and used for statistical estimation .\nThe Supreme Court case was a culmination of three separate cases decided between September 2018 and March 2019 .\nAdditionally , many state and city officials have raised concerns that inclusion of the question would significantly depress response rates , which in turn would affect the quality of Census data .\nDue to the urgency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government expedited the case to the Supreme Court .\nOn June 27 , 2019 , the Court decided that the Enumeration clause allows for a citizenship question to be added .\nVictory , right ?\nHowever , it also stated that such additions can be reviewed by courts noting that the administration \u2019 s explanation for adding the question \u201c appears to have been contrived \u201d .\nUnable to meet certain legal deadlines when the case was remanded to the District Court , the Trump administration announced it would issue an Executive Order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Commerce instead to tally immigration numbers .\nA final court order was issued in July 2019 barring the administration from adding the question to the 2020 Census or delaying the Census any further .\nWhat in the heck was that all about ?\n\u2022 Yes , you can include the question\u2026 .\nkind of .\n\u2022 Your explanation for doing so was bogus so we \u2019 ll make you slow walk it through the courts .\n\u2022 Then I will write an executive order and we \u2019 ll figure this out one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that back .\nNo , you can \u2019 t include the question .\nTHERE IS ALWAYS A WAY What Trump and Ross did with the 2020 census is a picture-perfect representation of the above \u2019 45 knows \u2019 framework .\nBut how much do you want to bet this flew right past 95 % of the population ?\nWithout reading the EO in its entirety here is a key excerpt which is in response to the Supreme Court forcing his administration to exclude the citizenship question : Collecting Information About Citizenship Status in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Trump speak to the EO click on the link below .\nTrump went on to say he would use the most comprehensive databases available ( Dept .\nof Homeland Security , Social Security Administration , etc . )\nand \u201c leave no stone unturned \u201d .\nHe also said that because of the executive order the longstanding obstacles to data sharing are now removed and will allow for far more accuracy than \u201c asking the single question alone \u201d .\nSo , Trump dispatches and empowers Wilbur Ross to work with both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assemble accurate citizenship data .\nNeither the president nor his Secretary of Commerce were going to be deterred in their quest to make sure they were empowered to collect census data as outlined and mandated by Article I , Section 2 of the Constitution .\nBut more specifically the goal was to determine who is and is not in this country legally .\nBut I want us to stop and think about it for a second .\nDoes anyone really think that Trump did not see this fight coming long ago ?\nHe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken out , the enemy would fight tooth and nail to make sure he was not able to include it again .\nSo , he had a plan whether he won or lost the court battle because he knew the long-term importance of the moment .\nBut you know what ?\nI have every reason to think he never really wanted the question in there to begin with .\nThink about the brilliance of that approach .\nWould you tell someone you were here illegally ?\nOf course not .\nTrump knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to truth about who is and is not here legally .\nThe citizenship question was never the story .\nNor was the story that Trump and Ross would figure it out somehow .\nThe real story was about the actual counting itself and that story did not kick in until well after data collection had started .\nThe Trump administration can stop counting Americans for the 2020 Census almost a month earlier than originally planned , the Supreme Court decided Tuesday , seemingly ending a months-long counting process mired by coronavirus-driven delays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administration .\n\u2022 The U.S. Census Bureau has repeatedly changed its deadline for residents to submit their Census forms and for workers to finish up their in-person counts .\n\u2022 After Covid-19 forced door-to-door outreach to pause in the spring , the Bureau extended the deadline for Census counting from late July to October 31 , but officials later abruptly moved it up to September 30 before eventually settling on October 5 .\n\u2022 Several advocacy groups sued the administration last month , arguing a September 30 stoppage would lead to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge in California issued an injunction and ordered the Bureau to stick with its original October deadline .\n\u2022 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to overturn that injunction , insisting the Bureau needs to stop collecting raw data immediately so it can meet a legal requirement to finish processing data by the end of the year .\n\u2022 Tuesday \u2019 s ruling allows the administration to stop counting operations while the court case winds its way through the federal appeals process .\n\u2022 The Census Bureau plans to finish up counting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bureau said in a statement issued shortly after the Supreme Court \u2019 s decision .\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor was the only judge to dissent from the decision .\nCensus Bureau officials are not sure they can meet their end-of-year data processing deadline even if counting is stopped early , she wrote , so stopping counting now might not help .\nShe also argued : \u201c meeting the deadline at the expense of the accuracy of the Census is not a cost worth paying.\n\u201d No other justice signed on to Sotomayor \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overview of the ruling .\nVIDEO > > DID WE MISS ANYONE ?\nAre we still tracking ?\nActually , this gets much more interesting .\nSo , we covered the citizenship question .\nWe covered the early end to the census and counting .\nWhat we have not covered is what you and I are about to see take center stage November 8th and its key to everything .\nYou see when Wilbur and Donald decided to end the census early , they changed history , potentially for a long time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick look inside the numbers and we \u2019 ll first focus on population growth alone .\nWe \u2019 ll use the U.S. overall and then a few keys states as regional examples .\n\u2022 The United States : The smallest population growth by percentage in 80 years .\nAgain , the population growth statistics were just low across the board but especially in high density urban areas .\nBut what does all this really mean functionally when the counts come in low ?\nWhat it means is that when population growth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that state is not able to garner federal funding in all sorts of categories like housing subsidies or school lunches .\nThese are the types of funds ( in billions ) that keep inner city populations dependent on government and in turn the government has all the control .\nBut even more important than funding is that states may actually gain or lose seats in the House of Representatives through Reapportionment ( or redistricting ) .\nSo , stopping the count early was a genius move by Trump and Ross .\nAs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruling to approve stopping the count , Sonia Sotomayor ( although liberal ) had quite the foresight when she said , \u201c meeting the deadline at the expense of the accuracy of the Census is not a cost worth paying.\n\u201d The states were sounding the alarm but there was nothing they could do .\nIs it possible that Sotomayor knew something ?\nWHAT WAS THAT QUESTION AGAIN ?\nYou seek folks , when Trump brought on Wilbur Ross , they both knew the fight ahead of them would be for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few simple web searches away from understanding the history between these two gentlemen and it will help you to perhaps better understand that winning can be ugly .\nIt \u2019 s a history that spans over 25 years before Trump even took office .\nWere they always on the up and up ?\nHardly .\nBut guess what ?\nWe have an enemy that if they get their way you and I will be servants if not victims of the ruling elite .\nThere was simply no way in Hades these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it meant throwing a few fastballs to the chin to get the batter to back away from the plate then they were fully prepared to do it .\nNot only were they on a mission to make sure the counting stopped early which it did , they were also on a mission to make sure that citizenship question somehow made its way back into the discussion .\nSometimes the best way to have your day in court is to make sure that day never comes\u2026 .\nYou see this is what an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so close to the deadline that they force SCOTUS to use the future as its excuse for not ruling in the present .\nBiden spun up an executive order to try and wipe all this out but by the time that happened the census was wrapped up and redistricting was largely handed over to the states .\nAs bad as it pains me to use the blessed MSNBC ( Haha ) as our proof text for exactly what a well-organized and executed plan will produce , I just could not resist .\nHere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings ( or lack of counting ) can impact the congressional landscape .\n\u2022 The number of gains in states that Biden won ?\n\u2022 The number of gains in states that Trump won ?\n\u2022 The number of loses in states where Biden won ?\n\u2022 The number of loses in states that Trump won ?\n\u2022 The number required to win back the house ?\nAnd for the first time in history the state of California lost a congressional seat .\nVIDEO > > THE BOTTOM LINE ON THE HOUSE So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2022 midterms , a couple longtime associates were framing up a plan that most had no earthly idea was even happening not to mention the impact it would have for many years to come .\nWho knew that a couple white guys with a combined age of 160 could make something as mundane as counting people so much\u2026.well\u2026fun ?\nThey \u2019 ll take your 81,000,000 fake votes and raise you about 10,000,000 fewer people in this country .\nOnly time will tell who was excluded from the count .\nBut the proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am pretty sure people on both sides know who was excluded .\nAnd for everyone out there still sounding the \u2018 we need Trump back now \u2018 alarm , it \u2019 s well overdue to start rethinking that point of view .\nUnderstand there are much bigger fish to fry and the fish currently occupying the White House is frying himself so just let that continue to sizzle .\nPlus , haven \u2019 t you heard the news ?\nThe 2030 Census is already in the planning phases , but it won \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you know\u2026.the 2nd half of the term of the candidate that wins the presidential election in 2024 .\nAny guesses on the name of that candidate ?\nThat \u2019 s right

the day after the day of the announcement of the announcement .\nHuh ?\nIn typical Donald Trump fashion standing in front of tens of thousands in Ohio , we all received not exactly what we expected but precisely what we needed .\nThe leader of the Republican party taking center stage while simultaneously recognizing the importance of the moment .\nIt \u2019 s the presumption of pretty much everyone that he will run for president for a third time .\nWhen Donald Trump burst onto the political scene in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered anything other than a joke , a complete joke .\nThere was simply no way the American people were going to buy into the concept that a reality show host was going to lead the free world .\nHad even his most ardent supporters known just how big of a visionary he was going to be , his impact on the fabric of society would be even greater .\nWhat people seem to have never understood about President Trump is that it was never his intention to lead the free world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world they are enslaved and then lead that world back to freedom .\nA task reserved for only a few qualified individuals throughout history .\nDare I say individuals that when they walk into a room force the very elite to fade into the background .\nLet us not mistake Donald Trump , the real estate mogul , or Donald Trump , the producer , or Donald Trump , the TV star of a reality show\u2026with Donald Trump the leader .\nDo you remember how excited we all were to watch Glenn Youngkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nTerry McAuliffe was obviously a child of the demonic system , so watching him being shown the door was an obvious sign of things to come .\nWith the exit of Ralph Northam , the bar was set pretty low because let us not forget this is the guy that , in his extreme compassion , said on a radio show that he thought it was critical that we keep a baby , fresh from the mother \u2019 s womb , comfortable just prior to killing it .\nSo short of Ted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Virginia was pretty much guaranteed an upgrade .\nSo , with Northam gone , the choices were either the literal spawn of Mr. and Mrs. Beelzebub or the sweater vest guy that may or may not end up being a RINO but who is at least saying you should make your own choices about your kids \u2019 education and health .\nWast that really a hard choice ?\nHaving said all that , I certainly hope and pray that none of us are buying into the flat-out lie that says somehow Glenn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how we \u2019 re going to win in the midterms without fully embracing Trump .\nBecause that is the narrative being pushed by the media .\nAnd when I say the media , I don \u2019 t mean MSNBC , CNN , CBS , and the other usual suspects .\nI mean ALL the media .\nIt was quite obvious to me that the likes of FoxNews was spouting the same narrative just with a different messaging approach that caters to the simpleton .\nWhen I say simpleton , I mean it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says to him or herself \u201c We need to embrace the good parts of Trump and ignore the bad parts of Trump just like Youngkin did .\nThat \u2019 s how we win in 2022.\n\u201d \u2022 The progressive simpleton says to him or herself \u201c Youngkin distanced himself from Trump , which is why he was so effective in his message .\nThat \u2019 s an effective recipe for Republicans , but scary for Democrats.\n\u201d Do you see how that is pretty much the exact same message delivered in two distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying hopefully they can win without embracing Trump and Democrats frightened the Republicans can win if they decide to do it without Trump .\nHoly crap is that ever a trap .\nFirst of all , this idea of a political stage even partially without Trump is catastrophically misplaced .\nDo we really need to be reminded that without Donald Trump there is no Glenn Youngkin because without Donald Trump we \u2019 d be in the 2nd year of the 2nd term of one Hillary Clinton .\nAnd what does that mean ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ CRT , BLM , and Transgender shoved at us by the truckloads we \u2019 d be experiencing something very different .\nWe \u2019 d be experiencing a much savvier politician ( love her or hate her ) capable of governing the simpletons in a way that produces a slow boil instead of a pressure cooker produced by a Biden administration .\nBiden is too stupid to understand the rate at which Americans can consume trash .\nHillary was a horrible campaigner , but you \u2019 d be a fool to think she \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump saved us from Hillary Clinton , and we can never forget it .\nSecond , literally everything Donald Trump has stated ended up being true and the more people that can tie their horses to that wagon the better because sure , they \u2019 ll be some rocky roads but once you hit that new frontier the real fun begins .\nThe Bible says that \u201c He who started a good work in you will be faithful to complete it \u201d ( Philippians 1:6 ) and abandoning Trump at this point would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst political decision imaginable .\nYoungkin was never the model because if you can \u2019 t win on stage where your opponent supports CRT and school boards turning a blind eye to a transgender raping a girl in a school bathroom , then you \u2019 re hopeless .\nCan we all stop pretending that with Trump on the sidelines these Republicans will magically find the model to govern conservatively ?\nBut much has changed even since the Youngkin victory .\nAmericans are turning to candidates like Kari Lake that doesn \u2019 t take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protecting our liberties and our sacred honor .\nEither candidates get on board , or they become irrelevant very quickly .\nTrump just moves these silly little rabbits around the chessboard like the pawns that they are .\nFor those still holding out hope that the old guard has even a shred of anything to offer us , let us use the great and powerful Lindsey Graham as our case study .\nWe all remember Lindsey \u2019 s classical theater production of \u201c Save The Judge \u201d during the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Kristine Blasey Freakshow or whatever her name is\u2026 Anyway , it was obvious acting in an environment where anyone with a functioning brain knew it was no risk whatsoever for Graham to put on that performance because we all knew the accusations were a bunch of lies .\nBut that same man back in January of 2021 suddenly turned his focus on making sure the people he serves get some lead rounds .\n\u2026.and people like Lindsey Graham are the reason we will NEVER give up our right to bear arms .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of citizens over the age of 18 are entitled to vote in federal and state elections , but voting was not always a default right for all Americans .\nOne thing to keep in mind is the United States Constitution , as originally written , did not define specifically who could or could not vote but rather it did establish \u2018 how \u2019 the new country would vote .\nArticle 1 of the Constitution determined that members of the Senate and House of Representatives would both be elected directly by popular vote .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative votes per state , typically based on the state \u2019 s population .\nThis was seen as a balance between the popular vote and using a state \u2019 s representatives in Congress to elect a president .\nBecause the Constitution did not specifically say who could vote , this question was largely left to the states into the 1800s .\nIn most cases , landowning white men were eligible to vote , while white women , black people , and other disadvantaged groups of the time were excluded from voting .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategies such as reducing polling locations in predominantly African American or other neighborhoods , or only having polling stations open during business hours , when many disenfranchised populations are working and unable to take time off .\nAnyone thinking voter suppression as myth is sorely mistaken .\nAll the tactics that are largely not happening today , unfortunately were once successful strategies .\nIt was not until the 15th Amendment was passed in 1869 that black men were allowed to vote .\nBut even so , many would-be voters faced artificial hurdles like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other measures meant to discourage them from exercising their voting right .\nThis would continue until the 24th Amendment in 1964 , which eliminated the poll tax , and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , which ended Jim Crow laws .\nWomen were denied the right to vote until 1920 , when the long efforts of the women \u2019 s suffrage movement resulted in the 19th Amendment .\nWith these amendments removing the previous barriers to voting ( particularly sex and race ) , theoretically American citizens over the age of 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later , in 1971 , the American voting age was lowered to 18 , building on the idea that if a person was old enough to serve their country in the military , they should be allowed to vote .\nWith these constitutional amendments and legislation like the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the struggle for widespread voting rights evolved from the Founding Fathers \u2019 era to the late 20th century .\nYour Vote Really Does Matter If you ever think that just one vote in a sea of millions can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the closest elections in U.S. history .\nIn 2000 , Al Gore narrowly lost the Electoral College vote to George W. Bush .\nThe election came down to a recount in Florida , where Bush had won the popular vote by such a small margin that it triggered an automatic recount and a Supreme Court case ( Bush v. Gore ) .\nIn the end , Bush won Florida by 0.009 percent of the votes cast in the state , or 537 votes .\nHad 600 more pro-Gore voters gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there may have been an entirely different president from 2000\u20132008 .\nWhile mid-term or presidential elections usually get a significant voter turnout , local elections are typically decided by a much smaller group of voters .\nA combined study collected from multiple universities found that fewer than 15 percent of eligible voters were turning out to vote for mayors , council members , and other local offices .\nLow turnout means that important local issues are determined by a limited group of voters , making a single vote even more statistically meaningful .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not 18 , or are not a U.S. citizen , you can still participate in the election process .\nYou may not be able to walk into a voting booth , but there are things you can do to get involved : \u2022 Read up on political issues and figure out where you stand .\n\u2022 You never know who might be listening .\nEven if you can not vote , you can still voice opinions on social media , in your school or local newspaper , or other public forums .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected , even if you are not able to vote yourself .\nIf you support a particular candidate , you can work on their by participating in phone banks , doing door-to-door outreach , writing postcards , or volunteering at campaign headquarters .\nMany people in countries around the world do not have the same freedoms we have , nor did many Americans in centuries past .\nNo matter what you believe or whom you support , it is important to exercise your rights .\nAt the end of the day the conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most certainly has a plan .\nAnd while even those that claim to be on this side hesitate to embrace him , that doesn \u2019 t change reality .\nDonald Trump changed America forever and he changed it overwhelmingly for the better .\nAs many of you know , I have said that the way this gets resolved is through good old fashion American traditions like what we will witness on Tuesday .\nIs fraud going on ?\nWell , of course it is , but the jig is up , and everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house and the senate in 2022 and if anyone doubts that then you \u2019 ll just have to wait and see .\nMy position has always been that the fight he is planning to win is a hundred times greater than merely winning re-election .\nHe plans to open every eye and every ear to what is taking place all around us at the federal , state , and local levels .\nCorruption that runs so deep that he knew it would take an army of patriots to be participating in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues to rage , it becomes difficult to see clearly from all the smoke , but that is when it is incumbent upon each and every one of us to choose this day whom we shall serve .\nWill we serve God ?\nOr will we serve man ?\nServing God may cost us everything but serving man will cost us eternity , which is a far greater price to pay in the end .\nI encourage you to serve God because it is only by his grace that we are able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy , which are many .\nThere can never be a point where you say enough , because those that have gone before us have died so that we might be willing to do the same for the generations ahead .\nLeave everything on the field .\nAmerica is fighting and we \u2019 re winning .\nBut we must fight for the things that matter .\nWe must fight for our heritage , our children , and our children \u2019 s children .\nPresident Trump , I believe to be an honorable man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI believe I have studied him enough to say that with a high degree of certainty .\nBut his intention was never to be the savior of America or the world .\nLeaders don \u2019 t fight all the battles but rather lead the way so that those they lead might fight as well .\nIt is only natural to fight for the things that actually mean something to you .\nThis is why in the last two years school board meetings across this country are filled with people that are standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know\u2026their children .\nTheir very bloodline is being threatened by the enemy , and that is simply a line that can not be crossed .\nBut we are turning the corner and these dreaded chains of tyranny are being trampled underfoot .\nWhen you drive to your polling location don \u2019 t forget the obvious and yet simple factors\u2026 There is so much talk of a red wave and justifiably so .\nAnd as providence would have it November 8th is a blood moon which means it will be impossible to avoid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night .\nBut the reality is that this is a red , white , and blue wave .\nThe victory parade is coming , so please tell me you will make your voice heard .\nToday

coronavirus and gain of function research in China ( and having worked with the Chinese team in Wuhan ) .\nWhat does Fauci say about EcoHealth Alliance ?\nOver two years after the COVID-19 pandemic began , and after millions dead worldwide , he \u2019 s \u201c vaguely familiar \u201d with their work .\nIn early 2020 , Fauci was put on notice that his group \u2013 NIAID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus research for the past five years .\nThis coincided with early reports \u2013 directly to Fauci , from Jeremy Ferrar and Christian Anderson \u2013 \u201c of the possibility of there being a manipulation of the virus \u201d based on the fact that \u201c it was an unusual virus.\n\u201d Fauci conceded that he was specifically made aware by Anderson that \u201c the unusual features of the virus \u201d make it look \u201c potentially engineered.\n\u201d Fauci couldn \u2019 t recall why he sent an article discussing gain of function research in China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling him it was essential that they speak on the phone .\nHe couldn \u2019 t recall speaking with Auchincloss via phone that day .\nBut remarkably , Fauci did remember assigning research tasks to Auchincloss Fauci was evasive on conversations with Francis Collins about whether NIAID may have funded coronavirus-related research in China , eventually stating \u201c I don \u2019 t recall.\n\u201d The phrase \u201c I don \u2019 t recall \u201d was prominent in Fauci \u2019 s deposition .\nHe said it a total of 174 times : According to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t recall \u201d 174 times , including when asked about emails that he sent , interviews that he gave , and other important information .\nFor example , Fauci couldn \u2019 t remember what anyone said on a call discussing whether the virus originated in a lab : \u2022 During that same call , Fauci couldn \u2019 t recall whether anyone expressed concern that the lab leak \u201c might discredit scientific funding projects.\n\u201d He also couldn \u2019 t recall whether there was a discussion about a lab leak distracting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , that they agreed there needed to be more time to investigate the virus origins \u2013 including the lab leak theory .\n\u2022 What else couldn \u2019 t Fauci remember ?\nWhether , early into the pandemic , his confidants raised concerns about social media posts about the origins of COVID-19 .\n\u2022 Yet Fauci did admit he was concerned about social media posts blaming China for the pandemic .\nHe even admitted the accidental lab leak \u201c certainly is a possibility , \u201d contradicting his prior claims to National Geographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated.\n\u201d \u2022 Fauci also couldn \u2019 t recall whether he had any conversations with Daszak about the origins of COVID-19 in February 2020 , but admitted those conversations might have happened : \u201c I told you before that I did not remember any direct conversations with him about the origin , and I said I very well might have had conversations but I don \u2019 t specifically remember conversations.\n\u201d And he couldn \u2019 t recall telling the media early on during the pandemic that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an animal to a human.\n\u201d \u2022 Fauci said he was in the dark on social media actions to curb speech and suspend accounts that posted COVID-19 information that didn \u2019 t fit the mainstream narrative : \u201c I \u2019 m not aware of suppression of speech on social media.\n\u201d Yet it was Fauci \u2019 s proclamations of the truth , whether about the origins of COVID-19 to the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine , that led to social media companies banning discussions of contrary information .\n\u2022 Regarding those removals of content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a US Government/Social Media effort to curb \u201c misinformation.\n\u201d But he conceded the possibility numerous times .\n\u2022 Then there \u2019 s the issue of masks .\nIn February 2020 , Fauci informed an acquaintance that was traveling : \u201c I do not recommend that you wear a mask.\n\u201d Fauci would later become a vocal proponent of masks only two months later .", "author": "x22report", "url": "https://x22report.com/optics-are-important-foreign-emoluments-clause-in-focus-operators-active-ep-2942/", "published": "Wed, 07 Dec 2022 00:21:51

that , this article will try to shed some light on the range of happenings , but first\u2026 .\nSomeone needs to inform Mitch McConnell that he and his pathetic uniparty friends have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWho would have ever known that infiltrating the grounds at Mar-a-Lago was as simple as pretending you were with the popular guy .\nIt was funny watching Trump set his white supremacy trap for the

just say there is no room in the Republican party for antisemitism or white supremacy and anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , in my judgment , are highly unlikely to ever be elected President of The United States \u201d .\nMitch , are your sure that is your position on Donald Trump ?\nBecause that certainly is an interesting take coming from a sitting Senator who consistently praised a man ( Robert Byrd ) that helped to start a chapter and ascended to the title of Exalted Cyclops in the Klu Klux Klan ( KKK ) .\nThe last time I checked current President Biden and former Presidents Obama and Clinton all three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOne last question Mitch .\nWas it you that wrote the below tribute article to Senator and former Klansman Byrd ?\nI just wanted to make sure you were aware that you , Obama , Biden , and both Clintons are currently occupying the same white supremacy pool in which you \u2019 re attempting to throw Donald Trump .\nOne of the major benefits of being Omnipresident is you have this unusual knack for knowing where all the bodies are buried .\nFortunately , Mitch McConnell has become lowing hanging fruit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McConnell continues to self-ripen year-after-year .\nAND YOU THOUGHT IT WAS ALL ABOUT VOTES ?\nOn November 15th , 2022 , Donald Trump stepped to the podium and delivered what is probably the most important speech he has ever given .\nA speech nobody wanted but one everyone needed .\nIf you were like me , after the first 1-2 minutes when you realized that the US Marines were not standing behind the curtain , well you tuned out .\nGiven the hype , it was perhaps about the biggest let down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red wave \u2019 never happened in early November and then the speech was anything but a big reveal , I went into a fog .\nAlthough not quite as intense , it felt similar to the fog I felt in November of 2020 .\nIt was the \u2018 what just happened ?\n\u2019 fog .\nLeading up to the speech many were convinced ( including myself ) that Donald Trump was getting ready to deliver a message so massive that all our dreams of deep state actors in chains , a 2020 election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into office were on the brink of fulfillment .\nThe mind is a powerful tool and if unchecked can become enemy # 1 .\nThere is the Donald Trump of our making and then there \u2019 s Donald Trump .\nOften times we put words in his mouth and insert meanings he obviously never intended .\nFor anyone that follows my work you know that my theory on how this whole thing gets fixed is based on the many relationships that Donald Trump has with private sector companies like Oracle and others .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ white hats because without control of the military this was really his only option , to use the private sector to somehow expose this corrupt system that spans every area of our lives .\nSo , I went back and watched the speech again .\nAnd then I watched it a third time .\nAfter the third watch I realized what he was telling us .\nHe was essentially saying , folks , it \u2019 s time to lay aside the fables , move into reality , and take control of this ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we allow the battles in our imaginations to take place the more we fail to see the magnitude of the one raging right here in the only place where it truly matters , reality .\nIn the minds of so many it had to be a military solution because we had convinced ourselves it was the only way .\nHow could any of this get resolved without the military stepping in and either forcing a new election or demanding adherence to the Constitution ?\nBut in that one speech he made me realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will solve this , and it requires a mind shift from Continuity of Government into something with a different set of personnel .\nIt requires the Continuity of the Governed .\nBut who will possibly lead this ?\nHow do the people rise without and uprising ?\nIt seems like there needs to be some event that precipitates citizen participation on a mass scale .\nPrecisely 17 days later we got the event we were waiting for .\nJust because you \u2019 re not \u2018 technically \u2019 in power doesn \u2019 t mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , I would argue that Donald Trump has as much if not more influence now as a private citizen than perhaps he even did as POTUS .\nMany may be asking Why the change in Elon Musk ?\nWhat made him suddenly decide to make an obvious play against the left and specifically against Joe Biden ?\nI guess I look at it differently .\nBecause is that even true ?\nIs this a \u2018 sudden \u2019 change ?\nFirst of all , even a moderate amount of research will show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides .\nHere is an example from 2017 when Elon gave a seemingly inexplicable endorsement for then Secretary of State , Rex Tillerson .\nRex was obviously about as big into \u2018 big oil \u2019 as you could get considering he was the former CEO of Exxon .\n\u201c Tillerson obviously did a competent job running Exxon , one of the largest companies in the world .\nIn that role , he was obligated to advance the cause of Exxon and did .\nIn the Sec of State role , he is obligated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I suspect he probably will .\nAlso , he has publicly acknowledged for years that a carbon tax could make sense .\nThere is no better person to push for that to become a reality than Tillerson .\nThis is what matters far more than pipelines or opening oil reserves .\nThe unpriced externality must be priced.\n\u201d Now Elon is not a rookie .\nHe knew there was absolutely no chance under a Trump Administration that Rex Tillerson was going to advocate for a carbon tax , which of course he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the policies put forth by Tillerson and Trump , the United States became a net exporter of oil .\nCarbon emissions have no impact on anything , and all these gentlemen know it .\nThey just talk the talk to keep the tree huggers at bay while the onshore and offshore pumps keep pumping .\nThe entire purpose of the Tillerson tenure was to make sure the global business relationships that companies like Exxon established with companies like Rosneft remain intact .\nPlus , the last time I checked the Tesla government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no sense to get into a back and forth with Tillerson who would have had substantial influence over those contracts .\nThere was a mutual respect there but also an understanding of reality by both men .\nBut what happens when that respect is not there ?\nWhat happens when an administration decides they want little or nothing to do with you ?\nDoes that change the calculus ?\nI wrote an article about 8 months ago about different technology executives and their connections , their relationships with each other , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBelow is an excerpt from that article as well as the accompanying video of the comments from Elon Musk .\nYou see folks , when you play in the power spaces that people like an Elon Musk , Larry Ellison , or even Donald Trump then the chess moves available are beyond anything you and I can fathom .\nBut at the end of the day , they are flesh and blood just like you and me .\nThey have all the range of emotions from elation to anger or from happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference being is that when Elon or Larry become angry or bent on \u2018 real \u2019 justice the possibilities are nearly incalculable .\nSo , when Biden decides to block the Oracle purchase of TikTok ( in the case of Ellison ) or decides to snub Tesla from the EV summit ( in the case of Musk ) the cards available to be played in response pack a very serious punch .\nIn fact , I am sure that when Biden made these decisions , he woefully underestimated the types of responses he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the responses ?\n\u2022 January 2022 \u2013 Elon Musk begins buying shares of Twitter in January 2022 , becoming the company \u2019 s largest shareholder by April with a 9.1 percent stake .\n( SOURCE : MARKET WATCH ) \u2022 April 2022 \u2013 Elon Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase which was resisted by the board with a \u2018 poison pill \u2019 strategy but ended up unanimously accepting the offer .\n( SOURCE : CNBC ) \u2022 May 2022 \u2013 Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison contributed $ 1 billion toward the Musk Twitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 May 2022 \u2013 Elon Musk was texting with Oracle \u2019 s Larry Ellison all night and \u201c into the early morning hours \u201d the day before putting the deal on hold .\n( SOURCE : NPR ) \u2022 June 2022 \u2013 Oracle and TikTok decide to move \u2018 ALL US Users Data \u2019 to Oracle servers in Austin , TX .\n( SOURCE : CNN ) \u2022 July 2022 \u2013 Elon Musk announces intention to terminate the agreement , asserting Twitter had breached agreement by refusing to crack down on spambots .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 2022 \u2013 The deal to purchase Twitter was closed and Elon Musk became the new owner and CEO , and Twitter was taken private .\n( SOURCE : MSN ) \u2022 December 2022 \u2013 Elon Musk releases the Hunter Biden laptop Twitter files and exposes massive corruption and election interference by Twitter , the Biden campaign , media , and multiple facets of the federal government which results in perhaps the biggest geo-political scandal in the last 50 years .\nWhen you lay it out in a linear fashion it becomes much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordination not between political and military components , but rather between some of the largest private corporate executives in the world .\nHere is a few more thoughts to consider in terms of the Trump/Musk/Twitter/Truth Social dynamic .\nI find it quite interesting , indeed bordering on strange that when creating a new social media platform , the Truth Social designers found it necessary to basically create a near replica of the very platform responsible for kicking their owner and president to the curb .\nWhy would a software design team take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them replicate them \u2019 approach to the graphical and functional design of the brand-new Truth Social platform ?\nThat is question # 1 .\nQuestion # 2 is how would you even go about replicating a product that took many years to build and then have it to market in less than a year ?\nSo again , why would you design it that way and how were you able to design it that way ?\nWell , this is where the \u2018 pissed off \u2019 executives dynamic comes into play once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on MySQL which is the # 1 open-source database in the world which just happens to be a product of none other than Oracle and Larry Ellison .\nThis probably also explains why Truth Social looks and acts precisely like Twitter .\nBecause when the man that gave Elon $ 1billion towards the Twitter purchase happens to be the same man that hosted a Trump fundraiser at his ranch in California then all you really have to do is put two and two together\u2026..and when you do that you find that 2 + @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of this is far-fetched then you might need to brush up on the history of Larry Ellison and Oracle .\nBy the way , if you think Larry doesn \u2019 t have a financial interest in the success of Elon , think again ( Larry Ellison and His 15 Million Shares of Tesla ) .\nI would start by reading Flight 1745 \u2013 Part 6 by Richard the Saint which will give the full meal deal on the depths and breadth of Larry and Oracle which dates back to the early 70s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season so below is just a touch of what you might find in that article .\nFor an intriguing potential military perspective on these types of initiatives I would also recommend The Wartime Presidency Part VII by SLAG from the excellent series of the same name .\nBut the overarching point here is that there are massive amounts of influence and power when the right minds apply themselves to solving a problem .\nBut the connections don \u2019 t stop on our shores .\nIt is always nice to have friends in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you remember when then President Donald Trump was all smiles when he did the sword dance as he arrived at a ceremony by Saudi Arabia \u2019 s King Salman in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia back in May of 2017 ?\nIf you recall , it was his first foreign trip as the 45th President which was quite unpopular given this had never been done before .\nIt was especially upsetting for his political enemies given the fact that the Saudis are looked at as habitual human rights abusers .\nAround that same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was deathly close to a possible Telsa buyout .\nAs it turned out that deal never transpired but the potential buyer was none other than Saudi Arabia .\nThe reason that is an interesting connection has less to do with 2017 and more to do with 2022 because if you remember correctly , after the Twitter purchase funds from Musk himself , Ellison and few other domestic investors , the final set of dollars came from Qatar Holding .\nWhat an interesting partner to jump on the Twitter acquisition bandwagon considering what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight relationship with President Trump .\nBut this didn \u2019 t seem to go over all that well with Joe .\nThis from Forbes back last month on November 12th\u2026 Well , that certainly wasn \u2019 t a very nice thing for a sitting president to say or presume about Elon .\n3 weeks later the entire world gets this gem which spawned a serious of \u2018 Twitter File \u2019 updates that would quite literally set the geo-political world ablaze\u2026.the Tweet heard round the world .\nIt continues to become increasingly sad that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any kind of government support needed to save this country , that support consistently comes from governments outside of America .\nBecause even though the cultures in Saudi Arabia or Qatar are drastically different , one thing the leadership understands is a healthy American economy means all sorts of opportunity for the other world economies .\nAnd don \u2019 t look now , but guess who is throwing in some early 2024 support for the Great MAGA King ?\nALL OF US As the battle continues to rage it becomes difficult to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is when it is incumbent upon each and every one of us to zone in on the things that can be explained with facts .\nThere can never be a point where you say \u2018 I give up \u2019 because those that have gone before us have died so that we might be willing to do the same for the generations ahead .\nLeave everything on the field .\nThe last thing

overcome it .\nAmerica is fighting and we \u2019 re winning .\nBut we must fight for the things that matter .\nWe must fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our children \u2019 s children .\nPresident Trump , I believe to an honorable man whose heart is in the right place .\nI believe I have studied him enough to say that with a high degree of certainty .\nBut his intention was never to be the savior of America or the world .\nLeaders don \u2019 t fight all the battles but rather lead the way so that those they lead might fight as well .\nIt is only natural to fight for the things that actually mean something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings across this country are filled with people that are standing up for the most precious commodity they know\u2026.their children .\nOur very bloodline is being

order for America to appreciate freedom in the way we \u2019 ve historically experienced it , we need to reach back into our history and show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commodity freedom was and still needs to be .\nAt this point , we need to deploy whatever team and tactics necessary to show the citizens of this country that in order to win this fight we must all become soldiers .\nLook around .\nLook

every day about how the government collects , analyzes , and flags your social media content .\n\u2022 Twitter \u2019 s contact with the FBI was constant and pervasive , as if it were a subsidiary .\n\u2022 Between January 2020 and November 2022 , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and former Twitter Trust and Safety chief Yoel Roth .\n\u2022 Some are mundane , like San Francisco agent Elvis Chan wishing Roth a Happy New Year along with a reminder to attend \u201c our quarterly call next week.\n\u201d Others are requests for information into Twitter users related to active investigations .\n\u2022 But a surprisingly high number are requests by the FBI for Twitter to take action on election misinformation , even involving joke tweets from low-follower accounts .\n\u2022 The FBI \u2019 s social media-focused task force , known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2016 election , swelled to 80 agents and corresponded with Twitter to identify alleged foreign influence and election tampering of all kinds .\n\u2022 Federal intelligence and law enforcement reach into Twitter included the Department of Homeland Security , which partnered with security contractors and think tanks to pressure Twitter to moderate content .\n\u2022 It \u2019 s no secret the government analyzes bulk data for all sorts of purposes , everything from tracking terror suspects to making economic forecasts .\n\u2022 The # TwitterFiles show something new : agencies like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content to Twitter through multiple entry points , pre-flagged for moderation .\n\u2022 What stands out is the sheer quantity of reports from the government .\nSome are aggregated from public hotlines : \u2022 12.An unanswered question : do agencies like FBI and DHS do in-house flagging work themselves , or farm it out ?\n\u201c You have to prove to me that inside the fucking government you can do any kind of massive data or AI search , \u201d says one former intelligence officer .\n\u2022 \u201c HELLO TWITTER

\u2022 14.Twitter personnel in that case went on to look for reasons to suspend all four accounts , including @ fromMA , whose tweets are almost all jokes ( see sample below ) , including his \u201c civic misinformation \u201d of Nov. 8 : \u2022 Just to show the FBI can be hyper-intrusive in both directions , they also asked Twitter to review a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except here it was even more obvious that @ ClaireFosterPHD , who kids a lot , was kidding : \u2022 \u201c Anyone who can not discern obvious satire from reality has no place making decisions for others or working for the feds , \u201d said @ ClaireFosterPHD , when told about the flagging .\n\u2022 17.Of the six accounts mentioned in the previous two emails , all but two \u2013 @ ClaireFosterPHD and @ fromMA \u2013 were suspended .\n\u2022 18.In an internal email from November 5 , 2022 , the FBI \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compiles and sends on complaints , sent the SF field office a long list of accounts that \u201c may warrant additional action \u201d : \u2022 19.Agent Chan passed the list on to his \u201c Twitter folks \u201d : \u2022 Twitter then replied with its list of actions taken .\nNote mercy shown to actor Billy Baldwin : \u2022 21.Many of the above accounts were satirical in nature , nearly all ( with the exceptions of Baldwin and @ RSBNetwork ) were relatively low engagement , and some were suspended , most with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter : \u2022 22.When told of the FBI flagging , @ lexitollah replied : \u201c My thoughts initially include 1 .\nSeems like prima facie 1A violation 2 .\nHoly cow , me , an

\u201d meeting with DHS , DOJ , FBI , and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence : \u2022 25.The Twitter exec writes she explicitly asked if there were \u201c impediments \u201d to the sharing of classified information \u201c with industry.\n\u201d The answer ?\n\u201c FBI was adamant no impediments to sharing exist.\n\u201d \u2022 This passage underscores the unique one-big-happy-family vibe between Twitter and the FBI .\nWith what other firm would the FBI blithely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classified information ?\n\u2022 27.At the bottom of that letter , she lists a series of \u201c escalations \u201d apparently raised at the meeting , which were already \u201c handled.\n\u201d \u2022 About one , she writes : \u201c Flagged a specific Tweet on Illinois use of modems to transmit election results in possible violation of the civic integrity policy ( except they do use that tech in limited circumstances ) .\n\u201d \u2022 29.Another internal letter from January , 2021 shows Twitter execs processing an FBI list of \u201c possible violative content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most tweets contained the same , \u201c Get out there and vote Wednesday !\n\u201d trope and had low engagement .\nThis is what the FBI spends its time on : \u2022 In this March , 2021 email , an FBI liaison thanks a senior Twitter exec for the chance to speak to \u201c you and the team , \u201d then delivers a packet of \u201c products \u201d : \u2022 32.The executive circulates the \u201c products , \u201d which are really DHS bulletins stressing the need for greater collaboration between law enforcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 33.The ubiquity of the 2016 Russian interference story as stated pretext for building out the censorship machine can \u2019 t be overstated .\nIt \u2019 s analogous to how 9/11 inspired the expansion of the security state .\n\u2022 34.While the DHS in its \u201c products \u201d pans \u201c permissive \u201d social media for offering \u201c operational advantages \u201d to Russians , it also explains that the \u201c Domestic Violent Extremist Threat \u201d requires addressing \u201c information gaps \u201d : \u2022 35.FBI in one case sent over so many \u201c possible violative content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other in Slack for the \u201c monumental undertaking \u201d of reviewing them : \u2022 36.There were multiple points of entry into Twitter for government-flagged reports .\nThis letter from Agent Chan to Roth references Teleporter , a platform through which Twitter could receive reports from the FBI : \u2022 37.Reports also came from different agencies .\nHere , an employee recommends \u201c bouncing \u201d content based on evidence from \u201c DHS etc \u201d : \u2022 39.Twitter for instance received reports via the Partner Support Portal , an outlet created by the Center for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DHS .\n\u2022 40.\n\u201c WHY WAS NO ACTION TAKEN ?\n\u201d Below , Twitter execs \u2013 receiving an alert from California officials , by way of \u201c our partner support portal \u201d \u2013 debate whether to act on a Trump tweet : \u2022 41.Here , a video was reported by the Election Integrity Project ( EIP ) at Stanford , apparently on the strength of information from the Center for Internet Security ( CIS ) : \u2022 42.If that \u2019 s confusing , it \u2019 s because the CIS is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners \u201d with the Cyber and Internet Security Agency ( CISA ) at the DHS : \u2022 43.The EIP is one of a series of government-affiliated think tanks that mass-review content , a list that also includes the Atlantic Council \u2019 s Digital Forensics Research Laboratory , and the University of Washington \u2019 s Center for Informed Policy .\n\u2022 44.The takeaway : what most people think of as the \u201c deep state \u201d is
