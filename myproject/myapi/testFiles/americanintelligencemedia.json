abandoned Judaism for a \u201c higher Torah \u201d ( Jewish Law ) based on the Zohar , which was the most important work in the Kabbala , the Jewish mystical movement .\nHence its members are also called themselves Zoharists .\nJacob Frank was a proponent of an antinomian anarchist approach that rejected all the prohibitions and restrictions of Jewish law , including the laws of incest .\nFrankists were master infiltrators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double life .\nThey practiced sexual orgiastic ecstasy as a sacrament .\nAfter Jacob Frank was imprisoned for thirteen years in the fortress

debauchery with his messianic blessing .\nIn business that meant say whatever it took to get the deal even if it meant breaking those promises when expedient .\nSabbatian Frankists are well documented in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israeli academics .\nIn a nutshell , these groups practiced incest , pedophilia , adultery and homosexuality and were otherwise depraved .\nThe Talmud states that the Messiah will come only in an age that is completely guilty or completely innocent ( Sanhedrin 98a ) .\nFrom this epigram , the Frankists would declare , \u2018 Since we can not all be saints , let us all be

was certainly worth hiding .\nBritish Lord Victor Rothschild did just that in 1973 .\nIn 1973 , British Lord Victor Rothschild ordered an official family timeline .\nThis occurred just after The Rothschild Report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended a complete overhaul of research and development investing by the British government with a focus on computers , communications and biowarfare .\n\u201c a detailed Rothschild family tree was commissioned which traced the family back to \u2018 Uri Feibesh \u2019 in 1450.\n\u201d Dubiously , \u201c Feibesh \u201d should be spelled \u201c Feibesch.\n\u201d Why misspell it ?\n( Thwarts searches . )\nRemarkably , neither the misspelling \u201c Feibesh \u201d nor the correct spelling \u201c Feibesch \u201d appears anywhere else in the Rothschild Archive !\nThis opening statement is an evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The year \u201c 1450 \u201d is also wrong .\nNumerous genealogies show that the Rothschilds ancestry includes : Prior to Uri , the ancestry trail goes cold .\nWhy would the Rothschild Archive not disclose Uri \u2019 s full name , including \u201c Bacharach ?\n\u201d The Bacharach family is a rabbinical dynasty in Frankfurt , Worms , Poland .\nRemember Lord Henry de Worms , Lord Pirbright ?\nBritish Privy Council , Lord Rothschild collaborator .\nThe Wellcome Trust .\nBiowarfare .\nFor context , the Frankfurt Jewish community was just being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wikipedia participates in this Rothschild misdirection .\nTheir \u201c Frankfurter Judengasse \u201d page states : \u201c It is likely that Jews were amongst the earliest

inhabited since the later Stone Age ( c. 2000 B.C. )\n.\nUntil the Romans arrived ( Emperor Augustus , 63 B.C .\nto 14 A.D. ) , the area had been controlled by various Germanic and Celtic tribes .\nWhy does Wikipedia misstate Frankfurt \u2019 s history so ludicrously ?\nEvidently it is because most drive-by \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it as misdirection about Frankfurt \u2019 s true history and the central role of the Rothschilds in world corruption .\nUri was the son of father Eichanan Ben Zur Bacharach Zur Roten Rose ( 1496-1550 ) and mother Fogele Rose \u201c Tzipora \u201d Bacharach ( born Worms Haas-Grotwohl ) ( 1505-1550 ) .\nEichanan had alias names Elchanan ben Uri , Han , Hon , Hane , Elkan , Elchanan Bauer .\nEichanan was the son of father Uri Feibesch ( Fajsch ) Zu Bacharach

\u201c Barcharach \u201d to \u201c Rothschild \u201d is suspicious since the Bacharach name would normally be retained , and since Mayer Amschel would otherwise have thought so little of his Bacharach family heritage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead !\nNotably , many Bacharachs emigrated to America in the late 1800s .\nThree Bacharachs are notable in the British Pilgrims Society \u2019 s infiltration of the

Barker Church , in all three banks as one of the largest founding shareholders and directors .\nDuring the Revolution , the British Crown-chartered shipping , fire and life insurer , The London Assurance Company ( chartered by the Bubble Act 1720 aka Royal Exchange and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a worldwide monopoly .\nThis insurance charter complemented The Bank of England charter of 1694 that was a sister Crown monopoly .\nLondon Assurance was formed by the Royal Exchange and London Assurance Corporation Act of 1919 giving the Crown ironclad control of insurance underwriting throughout the empire , including America .\nFor 34 years , John Barker , Esq .\nran London Assurance as director ( 1753 ) , deputy governor ( 1771-77 ) , sub-governor ( 1777 ) then governor ( 1777-87 ) .\nIn other

commerce , including slave and opium shipping .\nJohn Barker had a namesake nephew named John Barker Church .\nConsistent with the blood-dynasty propensity among these bankers , Barker set up his nephew John Barker Church in business in England .\nAccording to propaganda straight from UK Parliamentary archives , Church squandered his small fortune in gambling and stock speculation .\nThen , as the yarn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to \u201c John Carter \u201d and moved to the American colonies in 1774 , ostensibly to rehabilitate himself in anonymity .\nWe now believe this was just the cover story .\nJohn Carter was evidently sent to protect the London Assurance Company Crown interests of his uncle in America .\nNever mind that Parliament had just passed the Intolerable Acts in 1774 threatening martial law in Boston .\nThe Continental Congress had responded with threats of a trade boycott that would dramatically effect London Assurance \u2019 s ability to continue insuring American ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed his name to \u201c John Carter \u201d to disassociate him from his uncle so that he could be a secret London Assurance agent to manage the changing business winds .\nFrom that point on , John Carter magically had all the funds he needed to bankroll inventories for the Continental and French armies , the to fund Alexander Hamilton \u2019 s first three nascent American banks\u2014strapping America onto the demonic Crown Bank of England dead donkey from which were were striving to escape .\nIn fact , the archives show that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about John Carter and his coming out as John Barker Church .\nWe conclude that the British Crown sent John Carter aka John Barker Church to America as their Crown Agent .\nHe was tasked to ingratiate himself into one of the American families who were helping lead the Revolution .\nHe did that by eloping with Angelica Schuyler in 1777 .\nRemarkably , within two years of his arrival in Boston , he was appointed a commissar of the Continental Army .\nLogically , he bought himself into this position\u2014a stupendous achievement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Parliamentary propaganda said .\nKnowing that America would need a central bank , Carter-Church was tasked to use his funds liberally to make himself indispensable to the war effort , then offer to invest in the first banks , ostensibly for himself , but in fact for the British Crown in order to control the emergence of the new currency and bank debt .\nCarter-Church surely saw Alexander Hamilton \u2019 s courtship and marriage to Elizabeth Schuyler\u2014his wife \u2019 s sister\u2014in 1780 as kismet .\nFrom that point on , Carter-Church was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a staffer for General George Washington , with sophisticated banking ideas and goals well beyond his

and subterfuge to obscure the truth and protect a small group of banking families whose scams have fleeced every nation on earth and hidden the loot in offshore tax havens that hold the stolen wealth of the world .\nThese elite banking families own the controlling interests in the Fortune 500 companies through asset management companies , shill corporations , offshore accounts , and a thousand other \u201c old banking tricks \u201d that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammurabi of Babylon .\nThe Italian , Jewish , German , and Lombard bankers of Venice used the same old tricks of the \u201c father of

demon \u201c Mammon \u201d , hasn \u2019 t changed his ways since the cut-throat machinations of the Medici bankers laid down the principals of corporate warlord banking that are inherently immoral and work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predatory banking , and economic slavery .\nUltimately , these \u201c usury bankers \u201d convinced governments to lock people up for not paying back loans on time .\n\u201c Debtor \u2019 s Prison \u201d was the outcropping of banking families , later called merchant bankers , controlling governments and economies that reached beyond \u201c national \u201d limitations .\nAs commerce , trade , and mercantilism took over the world , bankers continued to have the upper hand and indeed made and destroyed kings and kingdoms with loans from their family banks .\nThese @

Knights of Malta , CFR , RIIA , the United Nations , and many other elite globalist groups .\nThe Inventors of Bank Fraud and the Demise of Babylon Money was first developed in the ancient world in temples that kept track of the storage of grain and food for the next season , which was initially a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service fee or interest .\nCoins and money were developed to represent the value of human labor and stored resources .\nEventually , temples began to use their excess grain stores , and hard coins , to make loans to others as investments .\nThis money was used for the benefit of the group , not the personal gain of the individual .\nWhen the control of money left the domain of the temple , the positive uses for surplus grain and coin were \u201c turned to the dark-side \u201d , and demons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple for the control of money and the lives of the people .\nUntil we have the full picture of the evolution of money ( Mammon ) , we will be unconsciously subject to these powerful demonic forces that are controlling our personal and global economic lives .\nThe story of money in the Western world begins around 2000 BC when the Babylonians had evolved into a highly developed commercialized society , complete with a sophisticated monetary and credit system .\nBarley and silver functioned side by side in a dual monetary system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exchange and standards of value .\nHistorically , barley preceded silver as the chief form of currency .\nA legal ratio established the value of silver in terms of barley and vice versa .\nCreditors accepted payments in either silver or barley , depending upon a debtor \u2019 s preference .\nSilver grew in importance relative to barley , and later Babylonian gold became a competing metal currency .\nThe Code of Hammurabi ( 2123-2108 BC ) specified grain money for certain payments and metal for others .\nMerchants who insisted upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe penalties .\nThe standard monetary unit was a shekel , equal to 180 grains of barley , or a fixed weight of silver .\nSilver was melted into small ingots that circulated as money and was usually tested for fineness at each transaction .\nSome of the ingots bore the image or super-scription of the god whose temple guaranteed the fineness of the silver .\nTemples lent goods from their stores for repayment in-kind as a general practice .\nThese loans charged no interest as long as they were repaid on time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business of sorts , making loans in silver and grain , and holding deposits of customers that earned interest .\nThese customers could pay obligations by writing drafts on these deposits .\nThe statutory rate of interest was 20 percent , but silver loans often earned 25 percent and grain loans more than 33 percent .\nBills of exchange were carved on clay tablets .\nIt is believed that traders began marking their own shekels in order to avoid the time-consuming process of weighing each transaction .\nMerchants who \u201c issued \u201d their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrons as IOUs .\nAny returning customers could then trade the marked shekel for a quantity of goods or services and the merchant would know that their standard weight secured the payment .\nThis method eventually developed into a coinage system where rulers and states developed their own sovereign currency as a standard for exchange .\nSince land was such an essential part of Babylonian life , banking firms at the time were heavily involved in real estate matters .\nBanking firms like the House of Egibi acted as land managers , renting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms dealt strictly with royal-owned lands .\nFor example , the House of Murashu , operating in the last half of the 5th Century BC , became successful by \u201c renting royal lands to tenant farmers and acting as agents in converting agriculture profits into metal.\n\u201d With prosperity came merchant bankers and a larger sector of the population participating in commercial and financial operations , whose transactions were based on a silver standard and modeled on promissory notes .\nContracts were written including a notarization by witnesses with the location and date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and totaled for an amount payable which could be loaned to the purchaser .\nAfter a debt was repaid , the creditor would break the promissory clay tablet .\nPrivate Babylonian banks also supported venture capitalists seeking commercial enterprises .\nA group of investors would pool their resources and give the capital to an individual to carry out commercial transactions to make a profit that would be divided among the initial investors , thus the model for corporations came into being .\nIn Babylon , at the time of Hammurabi , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the temple .\nTemples took in donations and tax revenue and amassed great wealth .\nThey redistributed these goods to people in need such as widows , orphans , and the poor and allowed people to take interest-bearing loans .\nThe loans were made at reduced below-market interest rates .\nSometimes arrangements were made to make food donations to the temple instead of repaying interest .\nOnce these systems of usury were established and the grip of Mammon was creating a cultural transformation based upon money , people naturally fell into debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt .\nThe debtor being imprisoned for debt could nominate his wife , a child , or slave to work off the debt .\nThe situation got so out of hand that King Hammurabi decreed that no one could be enslaved for more than three years for debt .\nOther cities , with residents racked by debt , issued moratoriums on all outstanding bills .\nThe worship of Mammon was taking hold of the cultures that embraced usury and focused on \u201c money that makes money from no labor \u201d \u2013 evil usury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Warlord Banking Families \u201d came into existence in Babylon in their initial form ; the Houses of Egibi , Murashu , Ea-iluta-bani , and Borsippa were such banking families .\nThese \u201c banksters \u201d were classified as \u201c merchant bankers \u201d but should be seen as worshipers of Mammon who turned culture significantly toward materialism and belief in greed and harmed and killed many people in the process .\nMammon in the New Testament of the Bible is commonly thought to mean money , material wealth , or any entity or devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greedy pursuit of personal gain and self-aggrandizement .\nIn the Middle Ages , Mammon was often personified as a demon and sometimes included in the seven princes of Hell who govern the \u201c Seven Deadly Sins.\n\u201d Mammon in Hebrew means \u201c money \u201d and is the god of material things , essentially the \u201c materialism \u201d of our time that seems to control most Westerners .\nThe Seven Deadly Sins lead to Hell , and Mammon is seen as one of the most powerful demons who herds humanity on the paths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their accompanying demons are often listed as : The word mammon can denote wealth or profit in the original Syriac dialect but also is the name of a Syrian deity who was the god of riches .\nThe Mishnaic Hebrew word mam\u00f4n means money , wealth , possessions , and \u201c that in which one trusts.\n\u201d Eventually , due to the Christian injunction against charging interest for money that is loaned to another person ( usury ) , the entire idea of money ( mammon ) became a pejorative , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , greed , gluttony , excessive materialism , and unjust worldly gain .\nThe \u201c worship \u201d of money was seen as a sin , and the work of the demon of greed , Mammon .\nLater , money becomes synonymous with hellish intent and bondage to the physical world which leads humans into the dark realms ; therefore , Christians were warned to stay away from practices of usury and the glorification of Mammon .\nIt was a common belief that usury is the work of the devil and certainly not fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be faithful with \u201c another \u201d and help them out of love , not for the purposes of money mongering for personal gain .\nThe Christian is careful not to be contaminated by the \u201c unrighteousness \u201d of wealth and money and the lure of Mammon .\nThe appearance of the demon of money and greed has changed over time .\nMammon is now a card credit or a PIN for your bank account , check , cash , Bitcoin , direct deposit , or a debit or credit to your account digitally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so engrained in Westerners that it is subconscious background noise that is seldom noticed .\nMammon rules the human will-power through tax-debt slavery , technological assaults on human lifestyles , and control of human addictions .\nThe Seven Deadly Sins are found in most Hollywood productions and the path to Hell is like a red carpet rolled out for \u201c warlord bankers and brokers \u201d who lavish themselves in the pride of greed , gluttony , lust , hatred , and war .\nMammon is global big-business , and the banking families aren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good returns on their investments , onerous usury , and global control of the flow of money .\nIt is probably fair to say that most Westerners are either overwhelmed with this system of Mammon or are blissfully ignorant and wallowing in the pigsty of materialism .\nIt is a comfortable mud-hole with scraps from the bankster elites to please the middle-class palette .\nSince Westerners have little understanding of the true history of the world , there is little or no understanding of the economic system of control that got us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where America owes banking families $ 25 trillion in debt through the U. S. Federal Reserve which creates continuous onerous debt that can never be paid off .\nEver rising debt is the usual method that banksters ( economic gangsters ) use to control entire countries through war debt \u2014 wars that the warmongering banksters often help to create .\nThe first \u201c modern \u201d bank was established in Venice with a guarantee from the State in 1157 AD and operated until 1797 acting in the interest of the Crusaders of Pope Urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bank of Venice , with an initial capital of 5,000,000 ducats .\nThis bank was the first national bank to have been established within the boundaries of Europe .\nIn the middle of the 13th Century , when certain rich Italian families saw the profits that the Venetian banking families were making , groups of Italian Christians , particularly the Cahorsins and Lombards , invented \u201c legal fictions \u201d to get around the ban on Christian usury .\nOne method of Christians effecting a loan with interest without

the Pope \u2019 s Usurers and reduced the importance of the Venetian and Italian Jews to European monarchs .\nThe most powerful Italian warlord banking families came from Florence , including the Acciaiuoli , Mozzi , Bardi , and Peruzzi families , which established branches throughout Europe .\nProbably the most famous Italian bank was the Medici bank , set up by Giovanni di Bicci de @ @ @ @ @

the start of the Lombard moneychangers in Europe , who moved from city to city along the busy pilgrim routes important for trade .\nBy the later Middle Ages , Christian merchants who lent money with interest were without opposition , and the Jews lost their privileged position as moneylenders .\nAfter 1400 , political forces turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise bankers and in 1401 , King Martin I of Aragon had some of these bankers expelled .\nIn 1403 , Henry IV of England prohibited them from taking profits in any way in his kingdom .\nIn 1409 , Flanders imprisoned and then expelled Genoese bankers .\nIn 1410 , all Italian merchants were expelled from Paris .\nLater , when modern banking practices became widespread , the Italian banking families became prominent again , especially between 1527 and 1572 when Italy produced a number of important banking family groups : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pinelli and Lomellini .\nThe Bardi , Peruzzi , and Acciaiuouli family banks , along with other large banks in Florence and Siena in particular , were all founded in the years around 1250 .\nIn the 1290s they grew dramatically in size and rapaciousness , and were reorganized , by the influx of new partners .\nThese were \u201c Black Guelph \u201d noble families , of the factions of northern Italian landed aristocracy , were always bitterly hostile to the government of the Holy Roman Empire .\nCharlemagne , 500 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a threat equal to the Vikings , and had organized a boycott to try to bring Venice to terms with his Empire .\nVenice in 1300 was the center of the Black Guelph faction which drove Dante and his co-thinkers from Florence .\nMachiavelli describes how by 1308 , the Black Guelph ruled everywhere in northern Italy except in Milan , which remained allied with the Holy Roman Empire , and was the most economically developed and powerful city-state in fourteenth century Italy .\nThe charter of the Parte Guelfa openly claimed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with Venice , the Black Guelph openly pushed for the Popes to change usury from a mortal sin to a venial sin .\nThe Venetians seemed to enjoy an effective exemption from the Catholic Popes injunctions against usury , and also from their ban on trading with the infidel \u2014 the Seljuk and Mamluk regimes of Egypt and Syria .\nA century earlier , in the 1180s , Doge ( Duke ) Ziani of

established the extraordinary , near-total dominance of trading in gold and silver coin and bullion throughout Europe and Asia .\nThe Black Guelph bankers of Florence did not simply loan money to monarchs and then expect repayment with interest , because interest was often \u201c officially \u201d not charged on the loans , since usury was considered a sin and a crime among Christians .\nThe primary conditionality was the pledging of royal revenues directly to the bankers \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national sovereignty against the Black Guelph \u201c privateers.\n\u201d Since in fourteenth century Europe important commodities like food , wool , clothing , salt , iron , etc .\nwere produced only under royal license and taxation , bank control of royal revenue led to , first , private monopolization of production of these commodities , and second , the banks \u2019 \u201c privatization \u201d and control of the functions of royal government itself .\nBy 1325 , the Peruzzi bank owned all of the revenues of the Kingdom of Naples ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most productive grain belt of the entire Mediterranean area ) ; they recruited and ran King Robert of Naples \u2019 army , collected his duties and taxes , appointed the officials of his government , and above everything sold all the grain from his kingdom .\nThey egged Robert on to continual wars to conquer Sicily , because through Spain , Sicily was allied with the Holy Roman Empire .\nThus , Sicily \u2019 s grain production , which the Peruzzi did not control , was reduced by war .\nKing Robert \u2019 @ @ @ @ @

finance papal operations .\nThey transferred collections from Europe and loaned them to the Popes in advance .\nThus , Venice controlled the papal credit and the continuing hostilities between the papacy and the Holy Roman Emperors .\nIn the Italian city-states themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the assignment of more and more of the revenues of the primary taxes to the bankers and other Guelph Party bondholders .\nFrom about 1315 , the Guelph abolished the income taxes in the city , but increased them on the surrounding rural areas into which they expanded their authority .\nThe bankers , merchants , and wealthy Guelph aristocrats did not pay taxes , but instead , they made loans to the city and governments .\nSome of the famous banks of Tuscany had failed already in the 1320s : the @

Procurators of San Marcos who controlled the collection of the taxes of the Republic .\nThe size of the Venetian bullion trade was huge : twice a year a \u201c bullion fleet \u201d of up to 20-30

stored for sale .\nVenetian bankers on the Rialto ( del Banco ) made cashless bank transfers among merchants \u2019 accounts , allowed overdrafts , gave credit lines on the spot , created @ @ @ @ @ @

charged fees to those involved in trade because exchanging currencies might be involved in a transaction .\nThese exchange fees were taken out of production and trade costs that hurt profits while the usury profits made the bankers ever richer .\nThen , the bankers made the \u201c bills of exchange \u201d even more expensive , to hedge against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being manipulated by Venetian bullion merchants .\nThus , bills of exchange in the fourteenth century cost 14 percent on average , worse than borrowing money at the set interest rate .\nUltimately , the Rialto del Bancos always gained more wealth from every deal , until of course , they went bankrupt .\nVenice switched Europe to gold by looting silver .\nEngland , for example , from 1300-1309 imported 90,000 pounds sterling in

bankers investing in trade became the basis for what would become corporations like the Dutch and British East India companies and the model for European central banks .\nIn southern Germany , two

to 1647 and Jacob \u201c the rich \u201d Fugger ( originally spelled \u201c Fucker \u201d ) became the richest man in history .\nAlso important to the Northern German city states establishing powerful banks was the influence of Dutch bankers .\nBerenberg Bank is the oldest bank in Germany and the world \u2019 s second oldest bank , established in 1590 by Dutch brothers Hans and Paul Berenberg in Hamburg .\nThe bank is still owned by the Berenberg banking family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metals from the New World , Japan , and other locales were being channeled into the Bank of Amsterdam .\nThe

traditional banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money-changing , and transferring funds were combined with the issuance of bank debt that served as a substitute for gold and silver coins .\nThis would lead to government regulations and the first central banks in Europe .\nThe success of the new banking techniques and practices in Amsterdam and London helped spread the concepts and ideas elsewhere in Europe .\nThe convenience of modern banking was becoming such a way of life that the modern person couldn \u2019 t really exist without a bank account .\nThus , the grip of Mammon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banking practices entered daily life more and more .\nThe original modern banks were \u201c merchant banks \u201d that Italian grain merchants invented in the Middle Ages .\nAs Lombard merchants and bankers grew in stature , based on the strength of the Lombard plains cereal crops , many displaced Jews fleeing Spanish persecution were attracted to the trade of banking in Italy .\nJews could not hold land in Italy , so they entered the great trading piazzas and halls of Lombardy , alongside local traders , and set up their benches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey had one great advantage over the locals .\nChristians were strictly forbidden the sin of usury , defined as lending at interest .\nThe Jewish newcomers , on the other hand , could lend to farmers against crops in the field , a high-risk loan at what would have been considered usurious rates by the Church ; but the Jews were not subject to the Church \u2019 s dictates .\nIn this way , they could secure the grain-sale rights against the eventual harvest .\nThey then began to advance payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distant ports .\nIn both cases they made their profit from the present discount against the future price .\nThis two-handed trade was time-consuming and soon there arose a class of merchants who were trading grain debt instead of grain .\nThe Jewish trader performed both financing ( credit ) and underwriting ( insurance ) functions .\nFinancing took the form of a crop loan at the beginning of the growing season , which allowed a farmer to cultivate his annual crop .\nUnderwriting in the form of a crop ( commodity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crop to its buyer , typically a merchant wholesaler .\nMerchant banking progressed from financing trade on one \u2019 s own behalf to settling trades for others and then to holding deposits for settlement of a \u201c billette \u201d or note written by the people who were still brokering the actual grain .\nAnd so , the merchant \u2019 s \u201c benches \u201d ( banco-bank ) in the great

turn the wheels of commerce into the gears of war .\nIn the 12th Century , the need to transfer large sums of money to finance the crusades stimulated the re-emergence of banking in western Europe .\nIn 1162 , Henry II of England levied a tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hospitallers acted as Henry \u2019 s bankers in the Holy Land .\nThe Templars \u2019 large land holdings across Europe also emerged in the 1100\u20131300 timeframe as the beginning of Europe-wide banking , as their practice was to take in local currency , for which a demand note would be given that would be good at any of their castles across Europe and the Levant , allowing movement of money without the usual risk of robbery while traveling .\nThe Crusades became the platform for merchant banking families to become Warlord Banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this day so that they might benefit by loaning money to both sides of the war and make a handsome profit .\nThen , once the victor is known , the Warlord Bankers set up a central banking system to create currency that enslaves the victims of the war to a debt that can never be paid off .\nThis central banking system assures that the \u201c money \u201d of a country or

you will find that it is the same old warlords and warmongers doing the same old bankster scams and frauds that have been going on since Babylonian times .\nWe will also find that even the same evil demons are worshiped in the same old fashion in many instances .\nThese rich elite believe they are above all laws and that they are global oligarchs ( lords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their slaves ( servants ) in a debt-slave , prison camp called the Kingdom of Oligarchs , Warlord Banksters , and Evil Brokers .\nThis article is the basis of what is needed as an overview of the past if you wish to understand Warlord Banksters and Brokers in the fashion that the Anonymous Patriots refer to them .\nWe have joined forces with the researchers at Americans4Innovation to help reveal the 200-year plan that these Warlord Banking Families have plotted out for the future of the world .\nThis plan began with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s propaganda and led to Cecil Rhodes and Alfred Milner , whose Round Table politics has driven war-policy for the Anglo-American Alliance .\nWhat was needed to fully understand what this 100-year plan was all about was the understanding of the genesis and development of these economic predators in the past \u2013 especially those banking families that are still powerful forces in global economics today .\nMuch of what the Anonymous Patriots reveal in our research is disconcerting to those who have not studied history outside of the mainstream propaganda found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who don \u2019 t want true history to be known .\nWe can not apologize for the grotesque and evil practices of these banksters .\nIn our research , we needed to connect to the oligarch \u2019 s insatiable desire for money \u2013 the worship of Mammon .\nBut we can point out that consciousness is all that is needed to shine the disinfecting light of day on the dark works of demon worshipers , until they melt away completely .\nSimple solutions will end Mammon \u2019 s control of nations , war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to do to melt down the economic warlords and warmongers is put an end to all off-shore accounts that fleece countries .\nThese accounts have amassed so much money that the money can not be repatriated into the countries it was stolen from without crashing that economy .\nThis type of grotesque wealth is an illness and a crime that must be dealt with as such .\nThe monarchy of England has more money in off-shore accounts than the total amount of currency in the world , according to many accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) has more gold than the total of all American gold reserves .\nThey keep this gold bullion in Swiss numbered accounts in the gold vaults of Zurich .\nAll of this wealth was acquired illegally and could be seized by those it was stolen from .\nWe know who stole it , how they took it , and where they put it .\nEvil is clever , but never wise and therefore easy to recognize in the light of day , and quite easy to stop .\nThe paths to hell are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are the paths of the same old seven deadly sins that have tempted humans since consciousness was born .\nFollowing the path of the 200-year plan of evil is easy when you know who you are dealing with and how they accomplish their machinations .\nOnce you understand the logic of evil , based solely on selfishness , it is easy to pull the rug out from underneath the people standing on that rug .\nFor instance , in America , to defeat a large part of this evil we only have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt to the Federal Reserve because it was a fraud from the beginning \u2013 a bankster fiat money scam based on onerous war-debt .\nThis type of fraud creates debt which is known from its inception to be impossible to repay \u2013 thus , perpetual debt enslavement .\n\u2018 We the People \u2019 owe the Federal Reserve nothing ; in fact , the Fed owes us .\nOnce there is no more war-debt to the Fed , we won \u2019 t need payroll taxes , just simple sales tax paid by everyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can also charge a tax for each purchase on the stock and commodity markets and then America will be richer than anyone can imagine .\nJust stop the theft from non-tax paying warlords , banksters , brokers , and warmongers and every American could be freed from debt-enslavement .\nOnce humans realize that their daily actions constitute their own personal \u201c religion \u201d , and that what they think about is what they \u201c worship \u201d \u2013 freedom can come from cutting the ties to economic predators that hinder the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual advancement .\nIf you can free yourself from the brainwashing of predator economics that is hiding under the guise of free-market capitalism and find a new way to relate to money as stored human effort , we can place the free , spiritual human being at the core of our economics , politics , and beliefs and remove the evil influences that have been spawned by money and Mammon being at the center of our lives .\nWe can become free when we love our work , and the efforts of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mammon \u2019 s tools but are recognized as the efforts of love that each human has to share with others .\nSelflessness destroys Mammon and the selfish pursuit of money when a pious soul shares money like they share love with their own children .\nAlexander Hamilton and American/British (

@ Health Organization run by the United Nation \u2019 s agency called the Health Assembly \u2013 which is a dummy organization that pretends like the Director General of WHO ( Darth Tedros ) is not in full control of WHO pronouncements .\nWHO advice is like a global medical encyclical from the supposed greatest authorities in the medical world \u2013 the Medical Pope .\nOops , Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is not a medical doctor but ultimately leads , single-handedly , the WHO \u2019 s \u201c commands \u201d concerning health emergencies of international concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down or kowtow to the leader of the world , Darth Tedros the Empire \u2019 s Pseudo-medical Sith Lord .\nThis video is available on Brighteon : https : //www.brighteon.com/1750ab41-3ec2-48de-8aea-3ad45281bb1c Dr. WHO ( Darth Ted ) is practicing medicine without a license , just like the biggest private economic donor to WHO , Bill Gates the Vaccine King .\nTedros helped Gates vaccinate most of Africa and enforce the Gates \u2019 Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa , which now controls most food production in Africa with genetically modified seeds and food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader in Ethiopia and an outspoken communist supporter , as we all saw with the way Tedros has shielded China throughout the \u201c China Virus \u201d and , to this day , has not done a thorough medical investigation to find \u201c case zero \u201d of the virus because the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee won \u2019 t let him do so \u2013 and he complies and makes excuses for them .\nTedros should know that both of the first two cases came from workers in the Wuhan BSL P-4 lab that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came from \u201c bat soup.\n\u201d Initially , Tedros the Sith Lord refused to look at the virus when some of us could already see by the reports that this Wuhan virus started spreading in late October , 2019 at the World Military Games .\nTedros told the world not to worry when the first widespread news of Covid was reported in January .\nHe refused to stop flights from China .\nHe refused to call a \u201c health emergency of international concern \u201d or an epidemic or pandemic even when faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world while the contagion spread .\nHe waited from October until March before he did anything and then downplayed the illness and even said early on that facemasks were useless against this virus but still demanded the enforcement of masks knowing that the studies all say masks harm people .\nHe has changed his mind repeatedly on almost every recommendation and it looked like he was just trying to see if there were any limits to his WHO super-powers .\nHe found out that there were only a few restrictions stopping his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has supposedly closed those few loopholes with an \u201c International Health Treaty \u201d he has created in his mind and not written down yet .\nSupposedly , over thirty nations have already agreed to Darth Ted \u2019 s \u201c International Health Treaty \u201d which , according to his own words , closes any opposition to total centralized world control via health concerns .\nOnce Tedros and his UN committees fumbled around for awhile further , the pandemic was spread by his actions ( and inactions ) and ultimately the advice given to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Covid killed many people .\nNone of Teddy \u2019 s advice as Dr. WHO did any good .\nVAERS shows the many , many vaccine adverse effects to the Covid vaccines , but the WHO remains silent .\nThe UN vaccine injury site is now out of commission but had shown over two million deaths from adverse effects from the five different Covid vaccines .\nTedros still , to this day , has not changed his conflicting advice on what to do about Covid or anything recommended by the WHO , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the healthy ( reversed the stated powers of the WHO by locking down the healthy ) , closing businesses , closing schools , discriminating against essential and non-essential businesses and people , stopping travel , etc.\n, etc.\n, etc .\nAll of these decisions , based upon WHO medical protocols , were made and delivered by Dr. WHO .\nAll of the fraudulent medical demands were instituted by ONE fake doctor \u2013 Fuhrer Tedros \u2013 who made the power of Hitler , Mussolini , Franco , Mao , Stalin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covid .\nBut get ready , Teddy Boys \u2019 new \u201c International Health Treaty \u201d will plug up all the holes he found during Covid in the United Nations World Health Organization \u2019 s global take-over of all nations , business , and economies .\nSorry , but we are too late to stop the overthrow of US sovereignty because US politicians have sold Americans out to the UN control of much of their lives , bloodstreams , health , and personal freedoms .\nEvery politician that voted the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) should be treated as traitors to the United States Constitution , which they swore to uphold .\nWe have preached and harped and yelled and screamed about these demonic laws that must be rescinded immediately because they demand that whatever the WHO advises becomes the law in America through the CDC and NIH \u2019 s mandatory compliance .\nThe laws are clear , but the Anonymous Patriots seem to be some of the few who have noticed that the UN take-over of America is already complete .\nCovid proved that the WHO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s ) demands become law in America once a stupid president or a stupid governor enacts emergency powers in relationship to a WHO declared pandemic and subsequently can become a dictator over their constituency .\nEveryone saw the fascism of the WHO become the fascism of the president and the dictatorial fascism of many governors during Covid .\nTHE LAWS SUPPORT THEIR DICTATORIAL , UNCONSTITUTIONAL ACTIONS , SO THEY WERE ACTING QUITE LEGALLY IF NOT ETHICALLY .\nThere was essentially nothing that any politician or leader was willing to do to stop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the well-known corrupt hands of United Nations ADMINISTRATORS like Fake Dr. Tedros .\nAnd on top of what Covid has already shown us about global health dominance , we now see Tedros demanding more power in a new \u201c health treaty \u201d after he has already proved himself to be incompetent and unqualified for anything but a fascist lover of Bill Gates , big-pharma , and communist China .\nTedros is not apologetic at all , but even demands more personal global power over all nations in his \u201c imagined \u201d health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committees are simply unelected bureaucratic vaccine-mongers who have sold out to pharmaceutical corporations in a plan to depopulate the world through fake-medicine and self-aggrandizement .\nThe criminal laws listed below spell out the overthrow of the US Constitution .\nThey are filled with unconstitutional tenets that abnegate all US citizens rights .\nAny politician who voted for these laws needs to answer to a military tribunal for treason .\nAny fifth-grade student would know these laws overthrow our constitutional republic .\nThese laws provide the ability for politicians to surrender all American freedoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NIH , and then , even the president can not stop the enactment of these horrible laws .\nA citizens \u2019 referendum could end these laws and win the battle for US sovereignty against the globalist \u2019 s intents of the United Nations World Health Organization .\nS.1379 \u2013 Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2019 We will quote Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus from the World Health Organization website where they recently posted a statement he made in Europe .\nI have selected relevant passages to demonstrate his polite demand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his personal hands .\nHe makes reference to his \u201c magical thinking \u201d International Health Treaty in these remarks , even though there is no such document , except in his mind .\nWHO Director-General \u2019 s remarks at the press conference with President of the European Council to discuss the proposal for an international pandemic treaty , 30 March 2021 \u201c It is now 425 days since declared COVID-19 a global health emergency.\n\u201d Translation : Tedros knows that he , and he alone , is in-charge of the WHO dictates .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty rooted in WHO , has resulted in the joint statement issued today and published in major newspapers around the world and in multiple languages , which has been signed , so far , by twenty-five heads of state and heads of government.\n\u201d Translation : They signed a document/treaty that doesn \u2019 t exist yet ?\nWords of a madman .\n\u201c \u2026The time to act is now .\nThe world can not afford to wait until the pandemic is over to start planning for the next one .\nWe must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fade and go back to business as usual.\n\u201d Translation : Sounds like Claus Swab speaking .\nNote that he implicitly indicates that the \u201c next one \u201d is coming very soon .\nHe was the WHO Director General for three years before Covid and he did no planning or preparation except to run simulations for the WHO pandemic take-over of the world : Event 201 , etc .\n\u201c \u2026Without an internationally coordinated , all-of-government , all-of-society , One Health approach to pandemic preparedness and response , we remain vulnerable.\n\u201d Translation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNote that it is an \u201c all government , all society , One Health approach \u201d , which sounds a lot like centralized globalist control of everyone under One Health Dictator .\nTedros wants it all , now .\nHe also leaves out any consideration for the sovereignty of nations in \u201c Teddy \u2019 s Globalist Health-controlled World Order.\n\u201d Teddy \u2019 s new \u201c International Health Treaty \u201d will create the longed-for New World Order with One Health , One Currency , One Medical Microchip Implant , One Religion , One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis fascist path is quite common in \u201c leaders \u201d who single-handedly want to control everything \u2013 hegemony .\n\u201c \u2026Ultimately , of course , how such a treaty is developed and what it looks like , and whether it is ratified , is a matter for our Member States [ UN Health Assembly ] \u2013 the nations of the world.\n\u201d Translation : Teddy says in other places in his statement that thirty nations have signed \u201c his treaty \u201d , but now you can see that he says that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to be developed by Member States ( even though it is already written in his head ) and ratified before a Global Medical Marshall Law take-over of the world can be effective .\nFake Doctor WHO , Tedros the Mighty , makes me think that I am in the Twilight Zone because he is supposed to be protecting people \u2019 s health but does the opposite .\nI wonder , is Dr. WHO an evil archetype of some strange sci-fi world we find ourselves in as the bombardment of pharma-wars , treaty-wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental toxin-wars on humans , food-wars , gas-wars , economic-wars , and unseen 5G wars are targeting humanity , especially in the West ?\nIn this absurdly crazy , medical sci-fi spy-thriller Tedros is the evil villain ( Sith Lord ) who allows and promotes \u201c mad human disease \u201d , bat viruses , CDC zombies , this pox or that pox , mRNA genetic modification , gene manipulation , corona/adeno/orthopox/rhino/entero/Marburg/HIV/SARS/flu viruses galore , gain of function synthetic viruses , transhuman cyborg implants , RFID chip implants , robot telemedicine , deadly lock-downs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protocols , deadly CDC & NIH biomedical countermeasures , NIH/CDC/DoD funding of BSL-P4 labs in

protocols , death by WHO ventilator protocols for Covid , etc.\n, etc.\n, and more etc .\nOf course , these are the wars waged against your bloodstream , body , soul , and spirit by invisible enemies protected by evil , demonic laws made legal by treasonous politicians , judges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a health industry focused on illness instead of health .\nThese same Pilgrims \u2019 control the world \u2019 s economies also , not just all of the different wars .\nUnfortunately , it doesn \u2019 t do any good to rail against the evil United Nation \u2019 s World Health Organization and its fascist direct , Dr. WHO \u2013 Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus \u2013 and his two unqualified committees that control the most powerful \u201c war actors \u201d in history \u2013 pharmaceutical corporations and billionaires interlocked with governmental agencies .\nThis is simply pseudo-medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world parading as doctors concerned about people \u2019 s health and bio-security .\nFor instance , \u201c We the People \u201d don \u2019 t really know what is in these evil injections \u2013 and big-pharma ain \u2019 t telling , nor are they taking any responsibilities for the injuries , illnesses , and deaths that have already arisen from the untested Emergency Use Authorization vaccines and unproven treatments .\nThis unprecedented public use of humans as lab-rats is wrong and inhumane .\nBut unfortunately , this killing is completely sanctioned by the premier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Health Organization , which has no labs , no doctors , no medical supplies and one Director General ( Dictator ) at the top pronouncing the mandates for all people on the Earth .\nIs this an Arthur C. Clark sci-fi nightmare , or what ?\nPlease wake me from this nightmare of ignorance , hatred , and scientific annihilation of humanity .\nWe might note that the Director General of WHO says that he already has many nations signed on to the idea of a \u201c international pandemic treaty \u201d that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the entire world ( so far : Albania , Chile , Costa Rica , the European Council , Fiji , France , Germany , Greece , Indonesia , Italy , Kenya , the Netherlands , Norway , Portugal , the Republic of Korea , Romania , Rwanda , Senegal , Serbia , South Africa , Spain , Thailand , Trinidad and Tobago , Tunisia , the United Kingdom , and Ukraine ) , as if the overly broad powers of the WHO was not good enough for Tedros .\nDr. WHO is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the Tigray People \u2019 s Liberation Front \u2013 a left-wing , terrorist , paramilitary group aligned with communism that overthrew the Ethiopian government but was later dismantled and made illegal .\nTedros \u2019 past is also littered with globalist grooming interventions and essentially , besides condoms and bed mosquito nets , Teddy has done little for African medicine and health concerns .\nGeneral Tedros has basically been an administrator and not a healer .\nAlso , remember that these thirty nations have \u201c signed on \u201d with Dr. WHO ( according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a treaty that has not even been written down .\nDue to the new American amendment to the UN WHO International Health Regulations ( 2005 ) , Article 12 , that is currently being purposed , Teddy won \u2019 t have to wait for his new \u201c treaty \u201d , in the form of a slippery \u201c regulation \u201d , to be ratified by member nations .\nIf the members can \u2019 t ratify the amendment in their respective nations within six months , then the amendment is automatically voted in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to stop Dr. WHO , and the American delegates to the Health Assembly are in on the overthrowing of American sovereignty .\nPharmaceutical global control has already been enacted by Tedros once through the existing International Health Regulations ( 2005 ) that enabled the take-over of the world through nefarious , incorrect health guidance and bad science from Dr. WHO and the committees of the United Nations Health Assembly .\nBy the way , Dr. Who personally selects the Board of the Health Assembly , the Emergency Committee , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , control the WHO .\nThe selections below from the WHO and IHR documents demonstrate this to be true .\nBut essentially , the Director General controls the WHO single-handedly .\nThus , Tedros is the ruler of the New World ( Medical ) Order , which has always been a vaccine cabal led by the United Nations \u2019 leadership under the propaganda guise of security , health , and peace .\nThe UN has never actualized any of those wonderful ideas .\nThe United Nations is , and always was , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relations , the Royal Institute of International Affairs ( British Round Table , of which the American version is the Council on Foreign Relations ) , the League of Nations and the International Network of Ambassadors established by the Anglo-American Pilgrims Society .\nMany people misname this group the \u201c Deep State \u201d and , over time , it has been called many other names .\nAt this point , the new mega-rich mafia is the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) that is in total support of Tedros controlling the world through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bad medical advice as a branch of corporate pharmaceutical interests .\nPandemics help the onset of the WEF \u2019 s reset .\nDr. WHO has basically said , \u201c You will be vaccinated , whether you like it or not.\n\u201d Essentially , the Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and the National Institutes for Health ( NIH ) are corporate/governmental pharmaceutical monopolies that , by the tenets of the US preparedness and pandemic laws , must follow the \u201c advice \u201d of the WHO .\nThus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United Nations \u2019 World Health Organization to suspend American constitutional rights .\nIn other words , we are at WAR and Dr. WHO is a war actor/criminal who must be arrested and tried for premeditated mass-murder for recommending health procedures world-wide that killed countless people .\nAnd now , Tedros wants all nations to agree to his yet unwritten \u201c International Pandemic Treaty \u201d that will give him more power than any person has ever held in history .\nThe life and death of millions deepens on ending and defunding the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IMF , WTO , and all the evil agencies that do the opposite of what they claim and propagandize to have as their goals .\nThe WHO kills and does not heal .\nJust look at the fact that even after Margaret Chan , former Director General of WHO ( a miserable failure of a health director in Hong Kong who led the WHO for ten years and botched the handling of Ebola and Swine Flu ) demonstrated that we were NOT prepared at all for pandemics , WHO did nothing to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was predicted and expected by the CDC , NIH , and many others .\nTedros admits that Margaret Chan had done nothing to protect the health of anybody , but in fact , made it much worse .\nTedros himself has been criticized throughout his career .\nHis actual successes amount to simply bragging about providing condoms , AIDs awareness education , mosquito nets , and lots and lots of Bill Gates and Big-pharma \u2019 s vaccines and experimental medicines for his fellow Africans .\nTedros has simply been a sock-puppet for pharmaceutical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much money running him for the office of Director General of the WHO to become the undisputed vaccine warlord of the world ( who is practicing medicine without a license on a global scale ) .\nTedros has never met a vaccine he didn \u2019 t like .\nHe has sacrificed many African nations , as a leader of the African Union , as Guinea pigs for vaccine research .\nThe crime of Gates \u2019 vaccine ( Gardasil ) sterilizing girls in Africa is well known but the many , many other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also depopulation fake-medicine crimes .\nTedros is an African medicine man on steroids dancing to the highest bidder \u2019 s tune .\nDr. WHO has never helped heal a single person in his life , he has always been a ladder-climbing administrator groomed for a fascist/communist position aligned with Big-pharma \u2013 ultimately to become the fascist medical dictator of the world .\nJust like every other agency in the United Nations , the WHO must be stopped , investigated and the criminals put to death or imprisoned for the premeditated murder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the CDC , NIH , GAVI , the Vaccine Alliance , Wellcome Trust , Bill and Melinda Gates Trust , Clinton Foundation , World Economic Forum , Rockefeller Foundation , etc.\n, must be charged with being premeditated depopulationists ( murderers ) who are committing global genocide to enhance their vaccine profits and self interests .\nOver seven trillion dollars has been given to Big-pharma so far for Covid .\nFormer director of the CDC Robert Redfield says Covid was nothing compared to the \u201c new \u201d bird flu that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c next pandemic \u201d Tedros is using as a fear tactic to push his \u201c Pandemic Treaty.\n\u201d But it doesn \u2019 t matter whether it is H5N1 or monkey-pox , or any of the gain of function man-made viruses funded by Fauci \u2019 s NIAID , the \u201c next \u201d VIRUS X

a marked increase in visits due to headaches , dizziness , nausea , stomachache , dyspnea , anger , acting out .\nThe child \u2019 s evaluation for school mask exemption initially took place at the requesting parent or parents \u2019 location of choice .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mouth , this author devised a system of referrals , a document set , a visit schedule , and a study protocol .\nAll parents were informed of the protocol and verbally agreed to allow de-identified data to be used in the study .\nThis author recruited \u201c Mask Captains \u201d comprised of parents who had completed the mask exemption assessment previously .\nEach Mask Captain was trained to provide the following services : \u2022 Provide documentation electronically for parents to complete prior to the visit with the examining physician \u2022 Request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most recent primary care physician \u2019 s office notes , and a personal statement from the parents describing the reason for the

infectious diseases \u2022 Provide chaperone service when requested by the parents \u2022 Provide original documentation to the parents and copy to the examining physician \u2022 Answer any follow-up questions for the parents The parental statement should reflect significant physical , psychological , and emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as changes which occurred when the FC was discontinued to demonstrate a significant contrast .\nThe exemptions were not provided nor promised in advance but were only provided upon completion of the assessment process .\nNo funds were collected for the service of the Mask Captains or the examining physician ; all services were volunteer based .\nOnce the student/parent completed the pre-check process , the examining physician \u2019 s role was to explain the process of obtaining a mask exemption , including the process of presentation to the school authorities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and photograph the student , provide post-examination counseling , and finally , answer questions associated with the process .\nIn the office following the examinations , the data from the examinations was logged onto a worksheet with approximately twenty-five conditions associated with prolonged FC use , tabulated , and used to construct this study .\nBecause the definition of the medical conditions which constitute \u201c medical intolerance \u201d was lacking , the author pressed the parents to describe in detail those physical and behavioral changes reported and how significantly they affected the student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s lives to understand the severity of the conditions and associated ramifications of FC use .\nRequests for exemptions for personal preferences were not provided .\nIn addition to the list of Qualifying Conditions above , an example of data used to define \u201c medical intolerance \u201d may include initiation of or modification of students \u2019 medications , reports from teachers , and the student \u2019 s and parent \u2019 s own statements .\nThe result of the study appears below .\nA total of 475 students , age four to eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data Table 2 .\n* Of those students qualifying for mask exemptions , 47.8 % complained of significant headaches , including tension type with and without vomiting , initiation or exacerbation of known migraine cephalgia , and exacerbation of cluster headaches .\nSignificantly , 46.3 % of students who qualified for exemptions complained of acute anxiety , acute exacerbation of chronic anxiety , claustrophobia , and finally , new onset or exacerbation of depressive symptoms .\nThe dyspnea/can \u2019 t breathe group demonstrated their symptomology in the classroom and with sporting activities .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppositional behaviors to sullen disrespect and mutism at school and home .\nConcentration/ distraction exploded in the attention deficit group ; although there were many new findings of inattention noticed by teachers and parents alike .\nAllergic and vasomotor rhinitis frequency was similar with obvious exacerbations due to FC wearing .\nAcne predominated in the skin changes but did not qualify for exemption .\nHowever , angular chelitis and contact dermatitis frequently qualified for exemption .\nFatigue and exhaustion were the issues most readily resolved with FC removal as the students \u2019 energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent .\nAsthma exacerbations resulted most often in modifications of chronic daily treatment or initiation of a referral back to the primary care physician to address the problem .\nApparently , the parents knew the cause of the exacerbation but were unable to effectively relay the reason for the exacerbation to the managing doctor .\nGastrointestinal upset was least frequent but clearly associated with FC use according to the parents .\nThis study reported the prevalence of symptoms described by students and parents .\nThe changes were verified by the examining physician , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for concern .\nMost students suffered from multiple adverse effects ; few suffered from a single event .\nWhile follow up of these conditions has not been completed , parents happily denoted that their children were symptom-free or symptom-reduced when FC were excluded .\nPhysical and behavioral changes followed according to the adverse event , and lack of events such as during summer vacations or after school at home , helped provide evidence that the FC use was at least an inciting event for these conditions .\nThe result of interviews with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their verbal and written concerns , and results of physical assessments is reported here .\nThis is new information presented to the pediatric medical community and may well represent a new diagnostic condition .\nAs the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen began its initial spread , pandemic emergency measures were implemented across workplaces , businesses , and schools with the intent to reduce the acute threat of the virus to the public health system quickly and effectively .\nFace mask use in the United States was initiated as an integral part of the Centers for Disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been adopted at the state , county , local school district and even school principal levels in an effort to first bend the curve of rising COVID-19 cases and deaths , then to reduce hospitalizations , then to reduce case numbers , and currently to pressure unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals to get either their primary series of vaccines or their boosters .\nDespite the unprecedented effort by the federal administration , universal masking remains a controversial topic across the country , particularly when it comes to school children , who may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damages from prolonged mask use .\nIn addition , promotion of the COVID-19 vaccine continues , even though the vaccine was produced against a now defunct alpha variant of the SARS-CoV-2 strain and has lost efficacy with time and multiple boosters .\nWith the passage of time , the effects of continuous masking in the kindergarten to senior high school age population have begun to show .\nUnfortunately , little reporting ( aside from anecdotes from parents ) have been published to date .\nThe goal , then , of this observational study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mask-induced symptoms in school-aged children .\nWhile much has been written regarding the efficacy of face mask use ( 4 ) , or even facial coverings ( including from gators to N95 masks properly fitted and used correctly ) , this observational study assumes affected children aged four to eighteen years are simply covering a portion of their face for a specified period of time ( during school hours , on the school bus to and from school , during monitored regular classroom , and after school activities such as sports , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be no comment on how effectively the face covering behavior is carried out or monitored .\nSignificantly , a comprehensive review of the undesirable side effects of mask use in adults has been recently reported by Kai Kisielinski , et.al.\n, in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health 2021 , 18 , 4344 titled : \u201c Is a Mask That Covers the Mouth and Nose Free from Undesirable Side Effects in Everyday Use and Free of Potential Hazards ?\n\u201d ( 2 ) The stated aim of that research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluate and compile scientifically proven related side effects of wearing masks.\n\u201d As such , the authors \u201c \u2026refer to the psychological and physical deterioration as well as multiple symptoms described because of these consistent , recurrent , and uniform presentation from different disciplines.\n\u201d The authors termed this collection of symptoms as Mask Induced Exhaustion Syndrome ( MIES ) .\nKisielinski \u2019 s et.al.\n, research was exhaustive , initially examining 1113 papers with a final tally of 65 scientific papers on masks qualified for a purely content-based evaluation .\nA chart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 of 42 of his paper .\n( 2 ) Interestingly , 22 of the 44 papers reviewing quantitative data were completed in 2020 , before the COVID-19 mask mandates .\nIn reviewing his work , several issues pertinent to this study are noted .\nMuch of the data from this study fits with the previously published condition described by Kisielinski , et.al , .\nThis author shall summarize them with more relevant headings .\nAccording to Kisielinski , et.al.\n, \u201c The literature revealed relevant adverse effects of masks in numerous disciplines.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Liu in 2020 , decreased oxygen , respiratory impairment , exhaustion/fatigue , and drowsiness/dizziness were all present within his study .\nControlled experimental settings with different mask types showed significant changes in pulse , O2 saturation , difficulty of breathing , dizziness , listlessness , impaired thinking , and concentration problems .\n( 5 ) Even our German colleagues have weighed in .\nAn observational study of tens of thousands of mask wearing children in Germany reported symptoms which were similar to this study : headaches ( 53 % ) and difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties ( 38 % ) , fatigue ( 37 % ) , and anxiety ( 25 % ) .\n( 6 ) Prolonged mask use with presumed elevation of carbon dioxide levels may affect heart rate , blood pressure , headache , fatigue , and concentration leading to long term consequences .\n( 7 ) Sub-threshold stimuli are also capable of causing pathological changes if the exposure time long enough .\n( 8 ) Six of ten studies of N95 mask users complained of significant headaches .\n( 2 ) A study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel caused detectable physical adverse effects , such as impaired cognition and headaches of which 28 % persisted and required medication .\n( 9,10 ) The apparent mechanism for these headaches is the trending toward hypercapnia and hypoxia contributing to cerebral artery vasodilation .\nAdditional factors include mechanical factors ( pressure from elastic ) pressing on nerves of the head and neck .\n( 10 ) Headaches were reported by 47.8 % or participants in the current study .\nBoth Masks and face shields caused fear in 46 % of children in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suppressed anger and rage , and constant distraction were present especially in the younger population of students already suffering from ADHD variants .\nEvidence of reduced psychomotor abilities , reduced responsiveness during important class interactions , and impaired cognitive performance were similarly present .\n( 12 ) Perhaps most importantly , the anxiety and psychovegitative stress reactions in children surely portend an increase in psychosomatic and stress-related illnesses , depressive self-experiences , reduced participation , social withdrawal , and lower health related self-care .\n( 12 ) \u201c Over 50 % of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressive symptoms.\n\u201d \u201c However , changes that lead to hypercapnia are known to trigger panic attacks.\n\u201d ( 13 ) Anxiety/panic/claustrophobia- ( 46.3 % ) , and concentration/distraction- ( 21.0 % ) were reported in this study .\nAll masks used during bicycle ergometer testing showed increased breathing frequency as well as shortness of breath and headaches with fabric masks .\n( 14 ) Low oxygen levels were directly correlated to new onset fatigue .\n( 13 , 15 ) The increased carbon dioxide was proven in adults during maximum load exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n( 16 ) Students who have not yet developed adult lung function are at significantly more risk for increased carbon dioxide effects ( 17 ) Fatigue and exhaustion were reported 9.5 % of the time in this study , although most were exercise related .\nIt is not surprising when students in running- intensive sports complained of weakness as well as becoming faint .\nEven in the face of the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advice against wearing masks during physical exercise , the schools continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student \u2019 s detriment .\nMasks interfere with nonverbal and verbal communications .\n( 14 ) \u201c According to experts , masks block the foundation of human communication and the exchange of emotions and not only hinder learning but deprive children of the positive effects of smiling , laughing and emotional mimicry .\nThe effectiveness of mask use in children as a viral protection is controversial and there is a lack of evidence for their widespread use in children\u2026 \u201d ( 18 ) Voice disorders can be aggravated by the need to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impaired vocal cord coordination .\n( 19 ) \u201c The mask , which originally served a purely hygienic purpose , has been transformed into a symbol of conformity and pseudo solidarity.\n\u201d Mark McDonald MD , Child Psychiatrist , in his newly published book : United States of Fear , How America Fell Victim to a Mass Delusional Psychosis , argued during a July 2021 roundtable discussion sponsored by Gov .\nRick DeSantis , \u201c \u2026there is no scientifically based medical reason to ever place a mask on a child in school .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ be child abuse.\n\u201d This is a powerful statement from a practicing child psychiatrist with enough ammunition to assist Florida Governor DeSantis in crafting his policy banning mask use in Florida schools.\n( 20 ) .\nDermatological side effects including acne , contact dermatitis , itching , and angular chelitis reported by Kisielinski et.al , were present in 11.4 % of students in this report .\nThese findings are likely due to reduced barrier function of the skin due to prolonged contact with the peri oral area compounded by the moisture of breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so called \u201c mask mouth \u201d with gingivitis , halitosis , candidiasis , chelitis , plaques and caries .\nCuriously , dry mouth is a proven effects of mask use .\n( 22 ) A contributing factor is a new form of irritant rhinitis due to fibers originating in the masks causing rhinitis , itching , swollen mucus membranes , and increased sneezing .\n( 23 ) These symptoms promote FC removal for nose hygiene further promoting dermatitis .\nMask use led to breathing problems in a British study in 100 School children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases in carbon dioxide in the inhaled air , this disease promotion effect has been proven with the creation of headaches , irritation of the respiratory tract up to asthma exacerbation as well as an increase in blood pressure and heart rate\u2026 ( 25 ) Despite listings for possible problems from such common conditions as asthma , bronchitis , anxiety disorders , physical disability , symptomatic rhinitis or acute respiratory conditions , the schools demanded mask use in this student population .\n( 7 ) New onset and asthma exacerbations were reported in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study .\nA frequent concern of parents , noted in both written and verbal accounts from this study ,

recommending unproven , unscientifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\n\u201d ( 4 ) In the advice by the WHO-UNICEF panel to decision makers on the use of mask for children in the community were these overarching guiding principles : \u2022 The best interest , health and well-being should be prioritized \u2022 The guidance should not negatively impact development and learning outcomes \u201c Based on expert opinion gathered through online meetings and consultative processes , children aged up to five years should not wear masks for source control due to loss of childhood developmental milestones and autonomy and use for children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should consider the child \u2019 s capacity to comply , the potential impact of mask wearing on learning , and psychological development among other issues.\n\u201d ( 4 , p8-9 ) In their own document , the WHO guidance on the community use of masks in children in the community\u2026 must be weighed up against the potential harms , including social and communication concerns .\n( 28 ) It is no wonder , that in verbal comments from parents , their children complain incessantly .\nThe stress of mask use comes from multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prioritizes social distancing and hand hygiene with moderate evidence and recommends wearing a mask with only weak evidence , especially in situation where individuals are unable to maintain a one-meter distance , ( 2 , 27 ) schools persist in placing students at further risk of the symptoms revealed in this study by always insisting on FC use .\nIt is cruel to demand mask use for hearing and speech impaired students and markedly counterproductive for instructors .\nFacial covering use clearly interferes with the educational , emotional , and social progress parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , peer pressure , and personal preference for FC use battle for the attention and emotional energy needed to live every day as a student .\nPatterns of health care providers behavior have begun to emerge in medical practices across the nation , fostered by the unexplained hesitancy by the medical community to both understand the problems associated with FC use , and provide workable solutions for the child and parent .\nWhen FC intolerance is noted by parents , and treatment requested from their primary care physicians and counselors/psychologist alike , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerance and encourage compliance without addressing the pressing problem at hand , referring rather handily to the instructions promoted by relevant medical societies .\nAn example of physician \u2019 s apparent reluctance to consider the negative impact of masking children can be drawn from a Heath Bulletin from the University of Utah written by Jeremy Kendrick , MD , Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Huntsman Mental Health Unit .\nKendrick asserts the following : \u201c The evidence we have does not point us to any concern that masks affect mental health negatively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note : \u201c We are experiencing a mental health crisis on top of a pandemic , and for children , this can be even harder .\nIt is a fact that kids are more anxious and depressed right now .\n\u2026There is no evidence that a child wearing a mask causes depression of anxiety.\n\u201d ( 29 , p5 of 7 of the bulletin ) Amazingly , Dr. Kendrick asserts no negative mental effects with mask use , then contradicts himself by noting a \u201c mental health crisis on top of a pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to FC use .\nHis solution is to simply require all children to wear masks in addition to appropriate counseling and medication , so they don \u2019 t experience the anxiety from looking different than their peers .\nWhile some medical professionals insist masking children is not problematic , others take a strong stance against the practice .\nContrasting the standard recommendation to mask children , Mark McDonald , MD Child Psychiatrist informed all of his patients of his professional policy via his website : \u201c Effective immediately , all forms of child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my office .\nThis includes masking of children.\n\u201d McDonald defends his policy , noting declines in speech and language development , cognitive decline , IQ point losses , and marked increases of office visits due to anxiety and depression .\n( 30 ) Indeed , the evidence presented in this paper supports avoiding FC use in children by the author .\nThe management of adverse effects of FC use early in the pandemic may have focused on perceived prevention of fearsome illnesses and death from Covid-19 .\nUnfortunately , many heath care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of facial covering use .\nWhen presented with the problem , they failed to reassess the situation and make constructive changes .\nAll the interested parents the author spoke with stated that their providers declined to issue exemptions but were not given written reasons .\nWhy ?\nClearly , parents as well as physicians who did provide facial covering exemptions disputed the standard masking policies during this pandemic .\nWhen the federal government lifted general mask requirements in spring of 2021 , the responsibility to impose FC use fell first to the states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governor \u2019 s ability to extend the emergency declaration ending state control of FC use .\nThen , by withholding State of Michigan funds from health departments , Michigan was able to control FC mandates which allowed health departments and school administrators to further enforce mandate FC use in schools .\nPerhaps employed physicians and allied health care providers suffered under the same onus as the health departments to conform to CDC guidelines which targeted healthcare facilities and schools .\nAs a result , FC exemptions were actively discouraged .\nWhile some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the masking of children , the outcome of the continued intolerance to mask wearing goes poorly addressed .\nThere seems to be little regard for the adverse effects mentioned in this document , notwithstanding the potential long-term damages mentioned elsewhere .\nThis apparent indifference by some in the health care community acutely exacerbates the anxiety and frustration plaguing the parents and provides little comfort for the affected child as they fall progressively behind in their studies and fail to deal with the associated physical and psychological damage due to physician inattention to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , a newly described diagnosis cited in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health 2021 , 18,4344 by K.

District Judge Kathryn Kimball MIzelle in Tampa , Florida struck down the federal mask mandate on airplanes and mass transit showing further evidence of inappropriate use of mask mandates .\nAn appeal by the White House is being considered .\n( 31 ) In addition , the same Federal Government is planning annual vaccine requirement starting in the fall of 2022 .\nPart of this federal planning anticipates ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Additionally , concern for progressively virulent variants must be considered .\nOngoing new vaccine development and readily available antiviral medications play a role as well .\nFacial covering use in children during the Covid-19 seasons , however , has been an unadulterated failure with severe adverse outcomes as demonstrated in this study .\nDespite all the damage and all the controversy , this author believes federal masks requirements will resume in the fall .\nAmazing , and tragic if it occurs .\nTo ensure that widespread masking policies are never instituted again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and adults alike , this author believes there are certain vital next steps that the medical community should pursue .\nFirst , recognize that the newly identified condition , Mask Induced Exhaustion Syndrome in Children-MIESC , should become the next area of intensive study .\nFuture investigators may use this author \u2019 s format to construct more detailed data sets .\nNational medical organizations such as the American Medical Association , American Osteopathic Association and all the pediatric medical associations should begin intensive evaluation of current office practices to elicit past and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong emphasis on risk-benefits .\nSecond , the loss of day-to-day skills of childhood demand further investigation and most certainly , prevention .\nOther investigators have enumerated complications of pandemic management risks such as IQ loss , social disruption , and delayed milestones ; topics not addressed in this document .\n( 20 ) Searching for the sources of practitioners \u2019 hesitancy to provide facial covering exemptions in obviously required situations will further remove barriers to learning encountered with facial covering use .\nUnfortunately , yet truthfully , as described by Kisielinski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the described symptoms constellation , MIES , in the mask-using populace , remains unclear and can not be estimated due to insufficient data.\n\u201d ( 2 ) This author \u2019 s hope is the data from this observational study will help build the database of adverse outcomes from facial covering use , stimulate further study , and add to the growing evidence of harms to our youngest citizens , especially considering future pandemic planning .\nThis study revealed a need for critical assessment of the medical , psychological , physical , and emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of the Covid-19 pandemic .\nThe apparent absence of insight of medical practitioners , failure to reassess ongoing risks , lack of evidence-based guidelines for face covering exemptions , or effect of outside forces such as federal , state , local and school level administrative mandates contributed to the harm to our children , a medical tragedy .\nDespite one-on-one pleas to primary care and specialist practitioners for facial covering relief by parents of suffering children , for the most part they only received a recommendation of tolerance .\nThis author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to practice medicine , ask the hard questions , seek the truth despite unreasonable demands by outside forces and treat your patients compassionately .\nAs I considered the effects of the interviews , of exams , of speaking with students and their parents , the overwhelming message I received was a sense of helplessness .\nAs the waning effects of the pandemic and particularly FC use became clear , the adverse effects of FC , lock downs , work related restrictions , and variability of protocols ramped up and could not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their primary care physicians , only to be met with a single unified response in so many situations : NO .\nThe parents clearly stated that their physicians were required to deny FC exemptions for no discernable reason .\nNo exceptions , no options , no discussion ;

TO LURE THE UNSUSPECTING Listen to Mike and Doug explain the findings that you will read about below .\nThe video is parked over at Brighteon : https : //www.brighteon.com/2d305a22-bc72-4b02-9a52-de623bb87213 Jun .\n08 , 2022\u2014Andrew Torba emerged meteorically , soon after the Trump election victory , replete with a canned conversion testimony that pivoted in the same breath into a blast of lukewarm Christians .\nHe went on the attack more like Saul Alinsky \u2019 s Rules for Radicals than St. Paul \u2019 s Road to Damascus ( Acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had a Christian world to save in GAB \u2019 s \u201c parallel [ Christian ] Society.\n\u201d Torba harangued in Mar .\n20 , 2021 that the British monarchy is superior to the American Republic .\nTo reinforce that , he has begun to pitch a bastardized \u201c Dominion theology.\n\u201d So-called \u201c dominion theology \u201d is not a reference to the British Crown and Commonwealth , who also call themselves the \u201c Dominion.\n\u201d Rather , dominion theology , discussed below , is an economic construct emerging from the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calvinist philosopher Rousas John Rushdoony .\nNorth later married Rushdoony \u2019 s daughter .\nRemarkably , on the very day of Dr. North \u2019 s funeral , a long article about Torba and dominion theology popped up on a nondescript Chicago blog by an eclectic writer named Mary Fairchild .\nSuspiciously , Fairchild dutifully added three long paragraphs to her \u201c About \u201d biography page suddenly discussing her alleged Christian faith .\nThose words had never been in her blog since she started it on Jun .\n07 , 2008 , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted on her site by Torba propagandists .\nThe Torba article included a discussion of the emigration of the Plymouth Pilgrims and emphasized that The Mayflower Compact ( 1620 ) \u201c is the prototype for our national liberty.\n\u201d It stated \u201c the U.S. government was never formed to establish a Christian nation.\n\u201d Remarkably , she writes \u201c God \u2019 s Word gives no commission to the church to fix the problems of the world.\n\u201d This polemic is a wolf in sheep \u2019 s clothing .\nThere are many admonitions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to preserve the world from ravages of sin , notably : Fairchild then summarized her notions of America \u2019 s political quest as : Neither of Fairchild \u2019 s \u201c quotes \u201d is real .\nIn support of these sham quotes , she cites only her Fairchild family genealogy which in turn cites a 1997 home learning guide .\nIn other words , she gave no primary sources for her novel political theory .\nThen , Fairchild ( or whoever wrote it for her ) doubled down , writing : Cornerstones ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ American constitutional republic was chosen because it protected the rights of the majority without infringing the rights of the minority .\nWhat did Fairchild hope the casual reader would conclude about Andrew Torba , GAB , Dominion theology and the American Republic in \u201c her \u201d jumble of misquotes ?\n\u2022 American governance started in the name of \u201c our dread sovereign Lord King James \u201d in The Plymouth Compact , who is \u201c defender of the faith.\n\u201d [ IN THE NAME OF GOD , AMEN .\nWe , whose names are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dread Sovereign Lord King James , by the Grace of God , of Great Britain , France , and Ireland , King , Defender of the Faith , & c. ] \u2022 Modern Christian notions of \u201c dominion theology \u201d support the supremacy of the British monarch \u2019 s rule over America .\n\u2022 Modern Christian notions of America being a \u201c Christian nation \u201d apart from British monarch are wrong , and \u201c dominion theology \u201d supposedly proves her point .\n\u2022 Andrew Torba \u2019 s \u201c dominion theology \u201d serves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the British monarchy \u2019 s Dominion .\nDr. Gary North just died and can not correct this novel use of \u201c dominion theology \u201d Torba \u2019 s British Pilgrims Society propagandists have evidently seized on the death of Dr. Gary North to repackage \u201c dominion theology \u201d into a pro-monarchy concept for evangelical Christians .\nWith North now dead , he can not correct this inversion of his ideas .\nAndrew Torba \u2019 s hackneyed pronouncements over the last 24 months present a bizarre romp of immature spiritual , political and economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTorba \u2019 s is a novel , juvenile creed .\nAt best they are the thoughts of a young Christian trying to find his way in the world , but whose hubris compels him to pontificate irresponsibly .\nFor that he could be forgiven as the pride of youth .\nActually , Torba \u2019 s writings read more like they were written by experienced third party propagandists who are only Christians in their day jobs .\nThey are lacking in humility .\nTheir task appears to be to write contradictory pieces that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not sure what is being said and simply follow the last thing they read .\nUse of chaos in perception management Such is the tactic in the use of \u201c chaos \u201d in perception management psychological warfare from Tavistock House ( UK ) .\nIt causes the hearer or reader to only remember the last story .\nJesus said , \u201c A good tree can not bring forth evil fruit ; neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .\nWherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.\n\u201d Matthew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just a month before he posted his \u201c monarchy is better , \u201d Torba posted an illustration titled \u201c Jesusland , United States of Canada \u201d allegedly showing those portions of the United States he considers to be his brand of Christianity .\nHe claims to be an American grassroots platform , but says the British monarchy is better .\n\u201c Jesusland ?\n\u201d Who says such trite stuff ?\nThis \u201c Jesusland \u201d nonsense telegraphs what the British Pilgrims Society propagandists are up to .\nThey are faking up novel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to either be : ( 1 ) associated with the British Crown , or ( 2 ) the opposite : to be opposed as a terroristic dismantling of the United States that must be put down as seditious .\nThe image shows 16 states in the United States that somebody associates with the British Crown Dominion , namely New York , California , Oregon , Washington , Wisconsin , Michigan , Illinois , Minnesota , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , Rhode Island , Connecticut , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , Vermont and Maine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen this image , you can not unseen it .\nWill \u201c dominion \u201d apply to a new United States under the British Crown , or those terroristic Christians that must be suppressed because they want to break up the United States in the name of dominion theology ?\nOnly the propagandists know .\nIn their minds , either way , they win .\nThe new \u201c dominion theology \u201d narrative being spun is that the true American government has always been ruled by the King , the true Dominion , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positing that even evangelical Christianity teaches this in \u201c dominion theology.\n\u201d But it does not .\nIn fact , Dr. Gary North , the man on whom the \u201c dominion theology \u201d label was applied , taught the opposite .\nHis friend Craig Bulkeley eulogized Dr. North with this summary : The only reference to a king in Dr. North \u2019 s thinking is God \u2019 s Kingdom The communist radical Saul Alinsky in Rules for Radicals taught his followers to have a backup plan .\nIf the British Pilgrims Society propagandists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they should be British monarchists who embrace The Mayflower Compact , then they can flip the strategy and use their redefined \u201c dominion theology \u201d to label Christians as radicals and terrorists .\nThis is a classical Hegelian dialectic : Fabricate a form of radical-sounding \u201c dominion theology , \u201d brand Christians with that label , fake up fire bomb and shooting false flags replete with \u201c dominion theology \u201d web ranting ( generated by the FBI ) , proclaim those \u201c dominion \u201d Christians \u201c terrorist , \u201d then remove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public from the radicalized Christian community trying to build \u2018 Jesusland.\n\u2019 \u201d In this backup strategy , GAB will cease to be a proponent of British monarchy and will become a digital shooting gallery to silence Christians .\nA close look at Torba \u2019 s background uncovers the telltale signs of yet another Jesuit cardboard cutout for the British Pilgrims Society .\nTo the Jesuits , \u201c dominion \u201d is a dogma Jesuit dominion that is .\nWhen British Privy Councilor Cecil Rhodes envisioned the Pilgrims Society ( which was first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the Round Table ) , he specified that it should be run like a Jesuit secret society that also employed Masonic tactics .\nAt the same time , Rhodes started the Rhodes Scholarship chaired by his business partners , the Crown banker Lord Nathan Mayer ( \u201c N.M. \u201d ) Rothschild , to train future British monarchists in their Empire cult .\nMost if not all of the founding members of the Pilgrims Society in 1902 were Sabbatian Frankists ( satanists ) , Masons , Jesuits and British Zionists .\nThey were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , head of the Church of England .\nMany of them pretended to be Christians in classical Sabbatian Frankist form .\nThis Fairchild propaganda piece probably inadvertently revealed the British Pilgrims Society \u2019 s hand .\nWe have suspected this for some time .\nThe British monarch evidently intends to lay claim over American lands claimed for the King in The Plymouth Compact\u2014the original Pilgrims !\nHence their choice of the name \u201c Pilgrims Society \u201d in 1902 .\nOn paper , Torba grew up in a blue-collar home in Moosic , Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHis brothers Alexander and Zachary attend Riverside too .\nHis neighborhood was heavily Polish Byzantine-rite Catholic .\nHe attended a large public high school , then was accepted into the $ 50,000-per-year Jesuit University of Scranton .\nHe enrolled in the Jesuit University of Scranton in the Fall of 2009 and in the first week of June 2010 he was inducted into the Alpha Lambda Delta national honor society of freshman .\nThis university costs approximately $ 50,000 per year .\nOn Feb. 07 , 2010 , Torba made the Dean \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 3.5 or better GPA according to The Times Leader ( Wilkes-Barre , PA ) .\nFour generations ago , Andrew \u2019 s great great great grandparents , coal miner Joseph and Josephine Torba , emigrated to America from Pozna\u0144 , Poland ca .\n1894 .\nJoseph was the son of Jacob Rudowig and Agnes Topolany .\nAndrew \u2019 s great grandparents were Leo A .\n( Alfred or Alfonc ) and Barbara L. Torba ( ne\u00e9 Laub ) .\nLeo worked for the Payne Coal Co. , Wilkes-Barre , Pennsylvania .\nTorba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not computers , engineering or science On Sep. 15 , 2010 , Torba received a \u201c renewable \u201d scholarship from the James F. Swift Scholarship Fund at the Scranton Area Foundation .\nPNC and Wells Fargo Banks are large donors .\nGroups funded in 2020 include the Red Cross , Boys & Girls Clubs , Catholic Services , Planned Parenthood , various YMCAs , Salvation Army , PBS , NPR .\nHe majored in philosophy with minors in entrepreneurship and political science .\n[ Note : Survivors of the Jesuit cult tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism of brain washing and mind control . ]\nWith nothing other than being \u201c fascinated \u201d by technology , Torba wrote a regular column for The Aquinas newspaper called \u201c Truthful | Tech.\n\u201d During his sophomore year he received funding to start a social media marketing company named \u201c Kuhcoon \u201d with eight employees .\nThe Scranton Area Foundation chairman , Ken Okrepkie , was adjunct faculty in the entrepreneurship program at the University of Scranton in which Torba minored .\nSince 2008 , Okrepkie has worked for Ben Franklin Technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seed capital investor that looks to globalist venture capitalists like Sequoia Capital , Kleiner Perkins and Accel Partners for their exits .\nBen Franklin Technology Partners invested twice in Immunotope sandwiched in between two grants from Anthony Fauci \u2019 s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , UNDISCLOSED Grant in Jun .\n2007 and $ 598,000 in Jul .\n2010 .\nOn the same day , Sep. 09 , 2010 , Torba announced he was starting up \u201c Kuhcoon \u201d social media with eight employees as he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOn Jul .\n24 , 2012 , Torba received another James F. Swift Scholarship to fund his senior year at the Jesuit University of Scranton .\nOn Aug. 01 , 2012 , Torba and his Kuhcoon LLC company was awarded $ 100,000 by the 10th Annual Great Valley Business Plan Competition .\nOn Nov. 11 , 2012 , Torba was the guest speaker at The Greater Scranton Chamber of Commerce .\nOn May 25 , 2013 , Andrew Robert Torba graduated from the Jesuit University of Scranton with a major in philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nDespite no background in technology , Torba was a regular columnist for the university \u2019 s The Aquinas \u201c Truthful | Tech \u201d all four years .\nIn other words , Torba was a Jesuit university groom .\nRemarkably , by Mar .\n16 , 2014 , Torba says \u201c One of our consulting clients is the largest community banks in the United States.\n\u201d This is astounding for a newbie startup .\nEvidently , Torba was being given contracts by his globalist handlers .\nOn Dec. 31 , 2014 , Midatech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targeting diabetes , was founded by Torba-GAB \u2019 s sponsor Ken Okrepkie \u2019 s Immunotope company\u2014UK partner of Anthony Fauci .\nGAB and Torba are interlocked with British Wellcome plc\u2014a key funder of biowarfare , including the patent of holder of Coronavirus\u2014the Pirbright Institute ( UK ) .\nHe is also interlocked through Midatech director Michele Luzi , who works for Mitt Romney \u2019 s Bain Capital and the World Economic Forum .\nMidatech \u2019 s chairman , Rolf Stahel , is interlocked with Fauci-co-conspirators including Wellcome plc ( now GlaxoSmithKline plc ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gates Foundation , Anthony Fauci \u2019 s NIH , DARPA , the EU , the British Pilgrims Society , Rockefeller Foundation , and others .\nOnce Torba left Kuhcoon , he started GAB .\nHe jumped from one project to the next with relative ease , as if he is merely a front man .\nHow were Torba \u2019 s GAB steps so perfectly placed as a young man with no technology background ?\nOn Sep. 16 , 2016 , Torba claimed that a Facebook whistleblower exposing censorship at Facebook \u201c pushed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Aug. 15 , 2016 .\nNote : According to Delaware corporation records , GAB AI INC. was incorporated on Sep. 09 , 2016 .\nPennsylvania corporation records reveal that \u201c Gab AI , Inc. \u201d was incorporated as a foreign corporation of Delaware on Aug. 30 , 2017 , a year later .\nGenerally , start-ups incorporate in the state of their origin .\nA Delaware incorporation is a level of sophistication reserved for lawyers with bigger plans for those they are grooming .\nDelaware is a notoriously-known tax and director liability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their London bankers .\nIt is also Pretender Joe Biden \u2019 s political roost .\nTorba \u2019 s feeble creation story reminds us of Zuckerberg \u2019 s equally feeble motivation for starting Facebook in late 2003 : \u201c I saw that Harvard didn \u2019 t have a facebook , so I made one.\n\u201d ( That just happened to be the moment when Columbus , Ohio inventor Leader Technologies had finished debugging a critical component of their five-year invention engineering , now called \u201c social networking.\n\u201d ) Our research into the Torba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week .\nOle \u2019 Andy was wiped out of some of our normal , reliable archiving channels .\nWe did not even have the name of his mother and father .\nIn our experience , when that happens , the person is hiding something that is not helpful to his or her propaganda persona .\nEventually , the dam broke and we discovered a Torba couple in Moosic , PA who filed for consumer debt bankruptcy on May 27 , 2015 ( granted Sep. 09 , 2015 ) .\nOn their public bankruptcy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrew was their son .\nHis father , Robert E.

bloodstreams of people who have received the Covid vaccine or died from Sudden Adult Death Syndrome ?\n\u2022 Could the super-permeation of graphene family substances in food , drinks , water , vaccines , medicines , cosmetics , packaging , and medicines be a planned conspiracy against human health ?\n\u2022 Are graphene oxide \u201c circuits \u201d being created in the human body to control the many nano-particle metals being injected into people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food ?\n\u2022 Can graphene oxide be \u201c pre-programmed \u201d before being inserted into injections , food , and the environment ?\n\u2022 Is the transhumanistic plan for \u201c aggressive remote-control of all things \u201d ( Internet of Things , Internet of the Body ) actually possible through new scientific \u201c mad-scientist \u201d experiments of human subjects using the Graphene Family Nano-materials ?\nThroughout the world , doctors are putting the Covid vaccine under the microscope , along with human blood from vaccinated people , and discovering the most astoundingly disgusting results that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with nano-metals , graphene and iron oxide nano-structures , and many other substances of \u201c unknown \u201d origin .\nThese substances are accumulating in blood vessels as they self-organize and self-replicate with the magnetic and electrically conductive materials found in the vaccines that are being used by the pre-programmed graphene oxide to build unidentifiable structures in blood vessels and tissue that block blood flow creating strokes and heart attacks .\nThese \u201c structures \u201d have also been analyzed and found to contain the same substances .\nGraphene oxide \u201c quantum dots \u201d , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumps over the brain-blood barrier and deposits toxic Graphene Oxide in the mid-brain , causing Alzheimer \u2019 s and Parkinson \u2019 s like symptoms \u2013 also called human spongiform encephalitis .\nGraphene Oxide flakes , sheets , webs , and 3D structures build blood clots that create vascular obstructions and heart problems leading to the \u201c vaccine death \u201d now called Sudden Adult Death Syndrome .\nMany of these new illnesses and symptoms are caused by , or exacerbated by , Graphene Oxide substances that \u201c build \u201d unwanted , and unnatural structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , man-made , sub-natural substances causing toxicity , harm , and death .\nGraphene Oxide organizes nano-metals into circuits that become sensors , activators , antennas , broadcasters , magnetic triggers , bio-electric devises , and mechanisms

bigger question is : Why did the CDC , NIH , WHO , Congress , Courts and the President sanction these crimes against humanity ?\nSadly , the answer is that this is Standard Operating Procedure for Big Pharma that is actually not an industry of health , but one of promoting illness and death \u2013 a pharmaceutical killing-field of depopulation .\nIt is easy to understand why so many people believe that Big Pharma is a depopulation syndicate of rich elite who wish to decrease the Earth \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as quickly as possible without being noticed and with complete impunity .\nSadly enough , there seems to be no other answer than the fact that this is all a planned eugenics policy of transnational pharmaceutical ( vaccine ) syndicates aligned with Big Pharma , WHO , CDC , NIH and many other agencies and organizations .\nFirst , let \u2019 s take a look at the proof that this toxic poison is in the bodies of vaccinated people via microscopic examination .\nIt is important to remember that most Covid vaccinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them , especially childhood vaccines since 2008 , flu shots , shingles and pneumonia vaccinations , as well as many medical treatments and procedures .\nHundreds of doctors worldwide are now examining the Covid vaccines , and human blood samples , under microscope and finding results that seem to be from a horrifying science-fiction movie .\nIn an article from The Defender , on August 25 , 2022 , entitled , Toxic , Metallic Compounds Found in All COVID Vaccine Samples Analyzed by German Scientists , by The Epoch Times , Enrico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists found toxic components \u2013 mostly metallic \u2013 in all the COVID-19 vaccine samples they analyzed , \u201c without exception \u201d using modern medical and physical measuring techniques .\nThe Working Group for COVID Vaccine Analysis says that some of the toxic elements found inside the AstraZeneca , Pfizer , and Moderna vaccine vials were not listed in the ingredient lists from the manufacturers .\nThe following metallic elements were found in the vaccines : \u201c We have established that the COVID-19 vaccines consistently contain , in addition to contaminants , substances the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine , \u201d their study says .\nIn an article from The Expose entitled : Covid Injection Aftermath : Study finds 94 % of \u201c Vaccine \u201d Recipients have Pre-Blood Clot Formations and Foreign Particles , by Rhonda Wilson , on 8/24/2022 the author states : \u201c An Italian study published two weeks ago in the International Journal of Vaccine Theory , Practice , and Research revealed almost everyone who had been injected had abnormalities after Covid vaccination .\nIn 94 % of vaccinees \u2019 blood , there was an aggregation of red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of various shapes and sizes .\nThe study began in March 2021 .\nUsing dark-field microscopy , the researchers analyzed blood samples from 1,006 referred to the Giovannini Biodiagnostic Centre for various disorders after being injected with Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccines .\nIn the study , authors noted that the vaccines are purported to contain at least the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 but are known also to contain foreign particles .\n\u201c Among those foreign components are metallic objects as demonstrated previously in this journal by Lee et al .\n( 2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Of the 1,006 cases analyzed , only 58 \u2013 equal to 5.77 % of the total \u2013 presented a completely normal hematological picture upon microscopic analysis after the last mRNA injection with either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine .\nThe blood of 948 \u2013 94 % of the study \u2019 s participants \u2013 showed aggregation of red blood cells and the presence of particles of various shapes and sizes of unclear origin one month after the mRNA injection .\nBlood clots found by morticians have been sent all over the world to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing that is for sure is that something is taking the injected metals and building them into \u201c killer clots \u201d throughout the body .\nThese clots have substances and structures inside of them that are \u201c unidentifiable \u201d and can not be explained by anyone .\nBut they are obviously designed to kill the host body that receives the injections .\nGraphene Oxide flakes self-organize , move towards each other , and build layers like an independent robot .\nThat is why they are used in hydrogels for the slow release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patch that can sense what the Graphene Oxide receivers are broadcasting about the chemical function of the liver , pancreas , or most any other diseased area .\nA doctor can also read a Graphene Oxide \u201c infested \u201d organ and then give electrical/magnetic commands for a hydrogel to release a specific amount of medicine .\nGraphene Oxide ( GO ) can do wonders because it is monoatomic \u2013 one atom thick , either as a \u201c dot \u201d , \u201c flake \u201d , \u201c sheet \u201d , \u201c tube \u201d , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graphene is carbon and carbon is the source of organic processes because it is seemingly amorphous , like silica in the inorganic world .\nAs GO sheets , GO hyper-connects in all directions ( superconductivity ) in length and breadth and scientists say it is 2D \u2013 which it is not .\nEven though , a sheet of GO is transparent , electro-conductive , 100 times stronger than steel , self-organizing , and self-replicating when in the presence of specific EMFs and magnetic fields .\nGraphene Oxid , GO , can be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or inorganic .\nGraphene Oxide as nano-tubes has created a diabolic industry of nano-technology that is far more evil than most people are aware of and yet touches most aspects of their life through myriad industries beyond just medical uses .\nGraphene Oxide and iron oxide ( both superparamagnetic ) are everywhere , but especially in vaccines , medicines , and food .\nThey supposedly control and target vaccine delivery but are also known for being a common adjuvant , a substance that is seen as \u201c foreign \u201d ( xenobiotic/inhuman ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen as an antigen or pathogen trying to harm the body .\nGraphene Oxide is considered toxic ( cytotoxic ) in the smallest amounts and accumulates in the body and yet it is used everywhere , including the lipid-coated nanotubes that deliver vaccines and other medicines .\nIt is also mutagenic , causing DNA damage and continuing mutation , just as mRNA vaccines have recently been proven to do .\nGraphene Oxide as nanowebs can combine dots , flakes , tubes , and sheets into animated nanowebs that self-organized , self-replicate and direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulatory system , as well as nanocircuits that target certain organs ( brain , heart , ovaries , testes , liver , etc . )\nand carry the payload inside the nanotube to the targeted organ .\nAll of these things are already happening , these are not science predictions , they are science fact .\nThese types of inhuman , mechanical , anti-life systems are being used right now , approved by the FDA , CDC , NIH , WHO , AMA , etc.\n, to target and attack cancer cells in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inject and move large amounts of Graphene Oxide with a magnet to a specific organ , inject a hydrogel and control the release of more nano-tubes from the hydrogel with a phone app to conduct telemedicine .\nThese GO nan-technologies , merged with mRNA , create the most-deadly genocide in human history because we have only seen the initial results .\nSome estimates are that over twelve million have died directly associated with the current jab .\nUntold others have terrible adverse reactions .\nThat doesn \u2019 t take into consideration the millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine death shots given out continuously for flu , pneumonia , shingles , or childhood vaccines .\nThe vaccine induced Sudden Infant Death Syndrome is now joined by the Sudden Adult Death Syndrome and the medical authorities actively look the other way as hundreds of athletes drop dead on the playing field before the audience .\nAnd still , the vaccine has not been pulled from the market and the guilty prosecuted .\nGraphene Oxide as fullerenes ( buckyballs ) is , as yet , little used .\nIt is a man-made 3D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also make other 3D geometric solids .\nThis is totally different than C-60 , a natural occurring substance which is presumed to be from meteorites .\nNaturally occurring C-60 ( fullerenes/buckyballs ) , which can be found in the rare mineraloid shungite , has nothing to do with the GO buckyballs created in laboratories .\nScientists believe that bucky-balls ( C-60 ) originate in space and are a highly developed form of carbon exposed to cosmic heat .\nThere is also C-70 , C-80 , and other carbon compounds found in space that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is one way to create Graphene Oxide \u2013 burn a steak on your barbeque and you have simple Graphene Oxide .\nIt seems quite likely that as human intelligence develops , so too does carbon develop in its many organic forms through a natural process of metamorphoses .\nWe owe our life to carbon and if more perfect forms of carbon already exist in our solar system and cosmos , then obviously we can metamorphose carbon into higher forms and functions .\nUnfortunately , our voodoo witch-doctor mad-scientists haven \u2019 t considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actively devolving into a \u201c Graphene World \u201d of one , two , and three dimensional , man-made monstrosities by injected a Frankenstein mutation ( mRNA is mutagenic ) into the new Graphene Oxide , Genetically Modified Human Being , a new species that has fallen out of the 3D world into the 2D Graphene World .\nHumans can advance to an objective view of time and enter a world of spiritual endurance ( 4D ) instead of the illusion of linear time ( 3D ) .\nModern materialistic science has devolved into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nets with 2D nanosheets/nanowebs that build \u201c fake \u201d human tissue with their 1D nano graphene dust/graphene flakes that are designed to kill human beings , ultimately leading to 0D \u2013 death .\nThis is clearly planned elimination of everyone who does not know the secret \u2013 \u201c Don \u2019 t take any injections of any kind.\n\u201d Graphene World is a world of sub-nature , a step backwards into immoral animal , plant , and mineral realms , not a step forward into higher forms of carbon in super-nature that are part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man-made sub-element that can only lead into darkness and the horrifying medical genocide we are seeing around us in all fields of medicine .\nEvery person involved in gain of function research on deadly viruses and vaccines is an enemy to humanity .\nUsing GO to deliver any vaccine is diabolical , then add mRNA and you have a truly evil group of murderers .\nThese types of experiments on \u201c uninformed \u201d humans are creating a new species of ill and dying humanity and an elite pharmaceutical syndicate that openly advocates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toxic chem-trail air , a medical industry creating illness , economic slavery , psychological subliminal programming , and the mass hypnosis of media propaganda that sold the world a fake pandemic \u2013 the fear of Virus X .\nVirus X , the highly prophesied pandemic of huge proportions , is spliced into the synthetic virus that was created in a bioweapon P-4 labs and disseminated to all other P-4 secure biolabs throughout the world .\nThis biological weapon of mass destruction was bio-engineered with funding from Dr. Anthony Fauci and the National Institutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the World Health Organization of the United Nation .\nThe United Nations is a clear Anti-American war-actor that took over American Constitutional freedoms via Pharmaceutical Terrorism with a fake pandemic supported with lies and bad protocols that killed millions .\nIt was made possible by Congress passing laws that allowed it : The All Hazards and Pandemic Act of 2019 .\nIron oxide as a vaccine adjuvant has been in most childhood vaccines since 2008 .\nGraphene Oxide is present everywhere in the environment and yet is poisonous , as proven in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medical industry pushes forward without any moral reflection on the harm being done to humans .\nThese Big Pharma doctors and drug-pushers are individuals who have devolved into immoral animals who are now below even what an animal would do to another animal .\nThe demonic forces involved in this global Pharmaceutical World War III are quite real and wish to turn all humans into machine-augmented cyborgs who can be \u201c stopped \u201d or \u201c controlled \u201d by pushing a button that activates transhuman wetworks inside the human body .\nThis nefarious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walker and is called \u201c The Aggressive Remote Control of Everything \u201d , which can only be fully accomplished by having an \u201c OFF \u201d button on every human being created by nano graphene technology .\nWhat is Graphene Oxide ( GO ) ?\nGraphene Oxide ( GO ) is a single atom carbon layer where both surfaces of the layer are modified by oxygen containing functional groups that are bonded together in a repeating pattern of hexagons .\nThere is tremendous interest in graphene and its derivatives [ graphene oxide ( GO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] due to their superior mechanical , thermal , electrical , optical , and chemical-adsorption properties .\nIn the past few years , graphene-based materials attracted much attention and were used for many practical applications in various industries .\nRecent developments on graphene synthesis from foodstuffs , use of graphene for food analyses , and graphene-based analytical methods in detection ( e.g.\n, composition , contaminants , toxins , and volatile organic compounds ) are used to help to ascertain the quality and/or safety of foods .\nThere are also antibacterial properties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packaging .\nGraphene Family Nano-materials trigger local and systemic toxic effects , induce genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo , alter the gut microbiome , cause genetic mutations , and are inedible .\nFurther toxicological and risk assessment studies are needed especially when used in food or injections of any type .\nDifferent applications have been suggested for graphene nano-materials ( GFNs ) in the food and feed chain .\nHowever , it is necessary to perform a risk assessment before they become market-ready , and when consumer exposure is demonstrated .\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Authority has published a guidance that has been recently updated to identify and characterize toxicological hazards related to GFNs after oral exposure .\nGFNs seemed to resist gastrointestinal digestion and were not able to be absorbed , distributed , and excreted , inducing toxic effects at different levels , including genotoxicity .\nAlso , dose has an important role as it has been reported that low doses are more toxic than high doses because GFNs tend to aggregate in the digestive system , changing the internal exposure scenario .\nThus , further studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect humanity from the , as yet unknown , effects of GFNs .\nAlthough Graphene Oxide \u2013 like graphene \u2013 is also a 2 Dimensional material , its properties are very different from that of graphene .\nIt does not absorb visible light , has a lower electric conductance compared to that of graphene , and demonstrates significantly higher chemical activity .\nIts high electron mobility is 100x faster than silicon ; it conducts heat 2x better than diamond ; its electrical conductivity is 13x better than copper ; it absorbs only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impervious so that even the smallest atom can \u2019 t pass through a defect-free monolayer graphene sheet with a thickness of about 0.33 nanometers .\nThere are about 3 million layers of graphene in a 1 mm thick sheet of graphite .\nHarder than diamond yet more elastic than rubber ; tougher than steel yet lighter than aluminum \u2013 graphene is the strongest known material .\nSome of the most promising applications of graphene are publicized as being in electronics ( as transistors and interconnects ) , detectors ( as sensor elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphene field-effect transistors ( FETs ) have already been created and used for nano analog communication or nano digital applications .\nAn ever-increasing number of research groups are exploiting programmable self-assembly properties of nucleic acids in creating rationally designed nano-shapes , nano-machines , and nano-electronic devices that can self-assemble for many different uses .\nThese devices include nano-routers , nano-antennas , and nano-circuit boards .\nMedical nano-technology researchers have created nano-bots , a popular term for molecules with a unique property that enables them to be programmed to carry out a specific task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body and interacts with biological blood or tissue , the GO picks up hydrogen and becomes graphene hydroxide .\nThe OH ( hydroxy ) groups can then split off a proton which leaves a negative charge affecting the whole graphene sheet and making it highly acidic and damaging to red blood cells .\nIt also is incredibly sharp and acts like razor blades cutting blood vessels , tissue , and organs .\nSelf-organizing GO tubes and sheets can block capillaries and arteries , with devastating effects when this occurs in the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body causes thrombogenicity , blood clotting , post inflammatory syndrome or systemic or multi-organ inflammations , causes alteration of the immune system , collapse of the immune system , cytokine storms , neurodegeneration , and mutagenic effects changing the DNA of the host .\nInhaled Graphene Oxide spreads evenly throughout the alveolar tract and causes bilateral pneumonias , inflammation of the mucous membranes , and loss of taste and smell .\nGraphene Oxide toxicity in the human body behaves like SARS-CoV-2 , generating the same symptomatology .\nGraphene , Graphene Oxide ( GO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire graphene-family nano-materials ( GFN ) are toxic in almost all their forms , causing mutagenesis ( cancer , chromosomal alteration ) , cell death , apoptosis , necrosis , and the release of free radicals .\nIt creates immunosuppression , damage to the central nervous system , circulatory , endocrine , reproductive , and urinary systems , which can cause anaphylactic death , and multi-organ dysfunction .\nIt increases toxicity rapidly in the lungs , creating cytokine storms leading to bilateral pneumonia , genotoxicity , and DNA damage .\nSeveral typical mechanisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been revealed in numerous studies , for instance , physical destruction , oxidative stress , DNA damage , inflammatory response , apoptosis , autophagy , and necrosis .\nIn these mechanisms , toll-like receptors , transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-\u03b2 ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-\u03b1 ) dependent-pathways are involved in the signaling pathway network , and oxidative stress plays a crucial role in these pathways .\nMany experiments have shown that Graphene Oxide nano-materials have toxic side effects in many biological applications .\nAccording to the USA FDA , graphene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxide elicit toxic effects both in vitro and in vivo .\nGraphene-family nano-materials ( GFN ) are not approved by the USA FDA for human consumption .\nGraphene Oxide has been used in a wide variety of nano-medical applications including tissue engineering , cancer treatment , medical imaging , and drug delivery .\nIts physiochemical properties allow for a structure to regulate the behavior of stem cells , with the potential to assist in the intracellular delivery of DNA , growth factors , and synthetic proteins .\nDue to its unique behavior in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer therapies .\nIt has also been used in vaccines and immunotherapy , including as a dual-use adjuvant and carrier of biomedical materials .\nIn September 2020 , researchers at the Shanghai National Engineering Research Center for Nanotechnology in China filed a patent for use of Graphene Oxide in a recombinant vaccine under development against SARS-CoV-2 .\nThe properties of graphene are exceptional from a physical , thermodynamic , electronic , mechanical , and magnetic point of view .\nIts characteristics allow it to be used as a superconductor , crystallized graphene nano-antenna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is an electromagnetic wave absorbing material , a signal emitter-receiver , and an antenna which makes it possible to create advanced nano and micrometric scale electronics .\nGraphene is a radio-modulatable nano-material .\nThe graphene molecule also has the ability to inject electrons into other biological substances depending on the electromagnetic environment and temperature .\nGraphene is activated at room temperature and above .\nGraphene can multiply radiation , acting as a nano-antenna , or else a signal repeater , a transistor .\nExposure to electromagnetic radiation can cause the exfoliation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quantum Dots ( GQD ) , whose properties and physical peculiarities are enhanced since they act by amplifying electromagnetic signals and , with that , the emission distance , especially in environments such as the human body .\nGraphene quantum dots can acquire various morphologies like hexagonal , triangular , circular , bucky-bulls , or irregular polygons and geometric solids .\nThe nightmare of Graphene Oxide circuits in human food is a Frankenstein monster that kills .\nAs Mark Wilson \u2019 s headline reads : Edible Graphene Is Here , And Electronics In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s article highlights the research conducted by Jeff Fitlowfrom Rice University thatuses a stock laser to carve edible circuits into food .\nThese researchers have successfully used a commercial laser to transform the surface carbon in foods \u2013 like toast , coconuts shells , potatoes , and Girl Scout cookies \u2013 into graphene .\nWithout using any special vacuums or clean rooms , graphene can be patterned into an impossibly thin , edible circuit .\nGraphene can be used to help fuel cells to store power , radio hardware to transmit data , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sorts of sensors , as well as deliver a preprogrammed piece of toast that can control your body .\nThese graphene circuits resemble a dark , inky tattoo , a bit like very burnt toast .\nBut , don \u2019 t forget , graphene is inedible , toxic , and a nerve poison .\nIron oxide nano-structures ( IONs ) in combination with graphene or its derivatives \u2013 e.g.\n, Graphene Oxide and reduced graphene oxide \u2013 hold great promise toward engineering of efficient nano-composites for enhancing the performance of advanced devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peculiar electrical and electrocatalytic properties displayed by composite structures in nanoscale dimensions , increasing efforts have been directed in recent years toward tailoring the properties of IONs-graphene based nanocomposites for developing more efficient electrochemical sensors .\nUnique features of IONs e.g.\n, strong magnetic properties , low toxicity , high adsorption ability for immobilization of desired biomolecules and good biocompatibility , together with elegant properties of this new member of the carbon family e.g.\n, high electrical/thermal conductivity , large surface area and electrocatalytic properties , have stimulated many interests for overcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving the performance of many current devices and methods .\nCatalytic activity of the graphene-IONs can be improved due to enhanced electronic communication e.g.\n, charge transfer between catalyst and support .\nAdditionally , synergistic effects of graphene sheets and IONs components provide nano-composite with novel physicochemical properties and consequently enhance electrochemical performance .\nAs a result , graphene-IONs nano-composites have been considered as one of the most promising hybrid materials that can boost the development of more efficient electrochemical sensors .\nDue to their tissue-like mechanical properties , hydrogels are being increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example are soft contact lenses .\nThese gel-like polymers consist of 90 percent water , are elastic and particularly biocompatible .\nHydrogels that are also electrically conductive allow additional fields of application , for example in the transmission of electrical signals in the body or as sensors .\nGraphene and graphene derivatives ( e.g.\n, Graphene Oxide ( GO ) reduced graphene oxide ( rGO ) ) have been incorporated into hydrogels to improve the properties ( e.g.\n, mechanical strength ) of conventional hydrogels and/or develop new functions ( e.g.\n, electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molecular interactions between graphene derivatives and various small or macromolecules enable the fabrication of various functional hydrogels appropriate for different biomedical applications .\nIn order to produce electrically conductive hydrogels , conventional hydrogels are usually mixed with current-conducting nano-materials that are made of metals or carbon , such as gold nano-wires , graphene or carbon nano-tubes .\nTo demonstrate the truth and efficacy of the above statements concerning the graphene family materials , we present below a series of research projects which summarize the \u201c state of the art \u201d concerning research in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much of what has been said above may have sounded alarmist , or even like wild , sci-fi fairytales of transhumanism , but the research below demonstrates that all

should certainly be \u201c not allowed \u201d by any moral scientist , doctor , or sane person .\nFor the sake of innovation , humanity is now a collective lab rat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug-doctors preaching the Gospel of Transhuman manipulation of the building blocks of DNA , human organs , tissue creation , neurological control through wetworks , and inhuman mechanical thinking that dominates \u201c precision medicine \u201d and nano-biology .\nEssentially , nano-biology should be an oxymoron instead of the current medical , experimental treatment , vaccine , or deadly medical procedure .\nMan-made toxic graphene does not belong in the human body .\nAfter reading these studies , I believe you will agree with the author that all Graphene Oxide use must end immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @

of inorganic nanoparticles is their ability to generate reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , such as singlet oxygen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radicals .\nThese ROS may then cause damage to cell membranes , organelles , and the nucleus by interacting with lipids , proteins , or nucleic acids .\nAs a result , many biochemical functions required to maintain cell viability , such as ATP production , DNA

and Europe was the rise of Seljuk Turk Islam .\nThey overran Babylon , redirected Silk Road commerce , blocking it from their enemies , then attacked the Holy Land , triggering the First and Second Crusades ( 1096-1099 A.D. , 1147-1149 A.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the evils of Babylonian bank usury and human slavery system that was disrupted , was the miraculous and well-documented discovery of the

St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the stewardship of a patroit . )\nThe Seljuk Turks disrupted the southern route of the Silk Road \u2014through Persia\u2014that had been controlled by the fake-Jewish Babylonian bankers The Seljuk Turks forced the fake Jewish ( Turkic-Persian-Sogdian-Khazarian ) banking houses of Babylon , then well known in Europe as Radhanites , to move north into Turkey .\nThese

Christian countries where usury was forbidden .\nSo in reality , we are concluding that the crowns of Europe were deceiving the public about their blood relationship with their Court Jews .\nThis deception enable their Ashkenazi-Khazarian-Sogdian-Turkic cousins to charge interest in banking so that they would be seen not to be violating the Scriptures against usury .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardened socialist British historian Sir Arthur Koestler ( 1977 ) call this \u201c the most cruel hoax which history has ever perpetrated.\n\u201d Curiously , at this very time , The Knights Templar ( 1118-1312 A.D. ) were chartering the first banks that DID NOT charge interest on loans .\nThis Knights Templar plan was wiped out when the Pope stripped the Templars of their assets and gave them to

Babylon in the 6th and 7th century B.C .\nwho actually controlled the commerce of Babylon .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob \u201d who most scholars agree was Jewish .\n( Wikipedia censors make a feeble attempt to distance Jacob from Judaism . )\nThe Egibi and Murashu families traded in gold , silver , spices , leather , perfume , currency , banking , law , accounting , debt , commodities , branded male and female slaves , boys , girls , castrated eunuchs , cattle , grain , etc .\nWe are discovering three interlocked demons from ancient Babylon : Mammon , Moloch and Ba \u2019 al .\nMany among The Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these demons .\nThey loved money and sacrificed their own , and their children , to this day .\nThe Bible confirms this multiple times .\nFor example : Leviticus 18:21 :

JESUS CHRIST : \u201c No one can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other , or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other .\nYou can not serve God and mammon.\n\u201d Babylon means \u201c sown in confusion.\n\u201d Mammon is old Aramaic for \u201c riches.\n\u201d Since nearly a millennia before Christ , these demons have directed fake-Jew dominance in banking , money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commerce , debt , tax collection , contracts , civil engineering and government , almost always for foreign kings and princes .\nThe challenge of reading Jewish history is to understand what \u201c Jewish \u201d even means .\nOriginally it was the Twelve-Tribe descendants of the biblical patriarch Jacob Deuteronomy 27 : 12 .\nThe Quran ( 7th century A.D. ) Surah 7 ( Al-A \u2019 raf ) verse 160 even states that the people of Moses were split into twelve tribes who fled Egypt in 1513 B.C .\nand settled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , later split into two \u201c half-tribes \u201d : Within 1000 years after the Exodus , \u201c Jewish \u201d merchants , traders and bankers are to be found living and working all over Europe , Middle East , Eurasia and China .\nFor example , the Book of Deuteronomy was written in the 7th century ( 641-609 BC ) .\nIndeed , the Bible called on the Children of Israel to declare a \u201c Day of Jubilee \u201d ( canceling of debt ) every seven years .\nDeuteronomy 15 called on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the sacrifice of sons and daughters in the fire , sorcery , omens , witchcraft , spells , spiritism .\nDeuteronomy 18:9-13 .\nThe Babylonian ( Radhanite ) fake-Jewish banks controlled the Chinese Silk Road trade and were only disturbed by the rise of the Seljuk Turks .\nWith that event ca .\n1000 , they rebranded themselves as \u201c Ashkenazi , \u201d constructed a new trading language , Yiddish , and took over the royal lines of \u201c Christian \u201d Europe , we believe these new facts are telling us .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ route through Khazaria , and simultaneously bifurcated the royal families of Europe into fake Christians rulers and their fake \u201c Court Jews.\n\u201d Historians tell us that Sogdian-Khazarians had large aquiline or hooked noses that set them apart in China .\nIn fact , the capital of Khazaria , Atil or Khazaran , was a western-most trading hub along the Silk Road ( at the mouth of the Volga River in present day Astrakhan , Russian Federation ) .\nCuriously , the Silk Road Turkic brother-merchants of Sogdia and Khazaria just disappeared from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sogdians , then 11th century for the Khazarians .\nMore likely , they were censored out of our collective consciousness .\nGenetically , Yiddish-speaking Ashkanazi fake Jews ( Radhanite ) emerged from four towns in modern-day Turkey , namely \u0130\u0219kenaz , Eskenaz , A\u0219hanaz , and Ashkuz .\nSir Arthur ( 1905-1983 ) rose to prominence during the emergence of a new and ruthless British banking corporatism that has now enslaved the world in onerous debt .\nThe central controller of this agenda is the British Pilgrims Society headquartered in the The City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district .\nSir Arthur was born in Budapest , Hungary to a Jewish family , lived on a kibbutz , was a Zionist , communist , Marxist-Leninist , parapsychologist , and a prolific historian and novelist .\nHe was knighted by the Queen in 1972 ( New Year \u2019 s Honours ) .\nThe \u201c hoax \u201d Koestler decries is the largely successful censorship of the true history of the Jews of Europe .\nKoestler believed that had this true history of the Jews been told , the six million Jews murdered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WWII would not have happened\u2014because they were Kazarian fake Jews who were neither Hebrew or semitic , and in fact , \u2026 they were more Aryan than the Germans !\nKoestler shows with thoroughly sourced scholarship that the Ashkenazi fake Jews of Europe are descended from semi-nomadic , Turkic , Sogdian , Khazarian traders from the Caucuses who converted to Judaism ca .\n8th century , and are not from semitic Hebrews .\nVigorous attempts are made to discredit this hypothesis , but they ring hollow .\nThey are buried in misdirection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start with snarky comments that turn off sincere scientists and overwhelm civilians .\nFor example , just look at the extensive information on their Silk Road trading partners to their east , the Sogdians .\nIt is extensive .\nHowever , these mercenary historians want us Westerners to believe that the Jewish-convert Khazarians were bereft of a rich cultural history over hundreds of years like their fellow Turkic Sogdian neighbors ?\nThis is preposterous .\nKhazarian history has been censored from our collective consciousness , we believe .\nWe believe this censorship is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the \u201c Great Diaspora \u201d as a centerpiece of their dominance of Israel and the Middle East in the 20th century .\nWe believe it is also designed to mask the Khazarian convert heritage of its banking and corporate aristocracy led by the Windsors ( Saxe-Coburg and Gotha ) , Rothschilds and other Radhanite ( Babylonian ) German families .\nThe British Pilgrims Society \u2019 s Jewish hegemony fiction dies when the truth of their fake-Jewish Turkic blood actually being Khazarian-Sogdian since ca .\n1000 , and not semitic .\nThe \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screeds that have worked so well will lose their potency as this becomes widely known .\nIn short , the argument against Kharzarian origins of fake Jews is the best fake history ( \u201c hoax \u201d ) that money can buy from mercenary historians , as Koestler\u2014a likely Khazarian-Sogdian fake Jew himself\u2014points out .\nThese historians jump through hoops to dismiss multiple new haplogroup ( DNA ) studies that discredit the classical stories of the \u201c diaspora \u201d of Israeli and Sephardic Jews \u201c migrating \u201d into the Rhineland ( Germany ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to \u201c migrate \u201d like inchworms .\nThese locations were a month \u2019 s journey by land or a single ship ride by sea .\nThose haplogroups favor Khazarian/Turkic origins of Jewish converts from the land mass spanning Turkey in the southwest , to the Aral Sea in the east , to Kiev across to Rostov-on-the-Don in the north .\nHistory shows us that the Turkic Khazarians and Sogdians to their east were great traders along the Silk Road from China into Byzantium and Europe .\nThey traded in spices , silks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , silver , luxuries and slaves .\nThese facts are undisputed .\nKhazaria became the favored \u201c northern route \u201d into China once the Moslem Seljuk Turks captured Babylon .\nWhy wouldn \u2019 t the fake \u201c Christian \u201d crowns of Europe and their fake Jew banker Rothschilds et al brothers want us to know this history ?\nWe believe the answer is because it would reveal that the \u201d Christian \u201d nobility and \u201c Jewish \u201d bankers

Muslim world to note the Slavs .\nThere were a number of others \u2013 we will bring you those reports over time beginning with four that are descriptive of the activities of certain early medieval trading groups .\nOne such group are the Radhaniya ( Radania , Radhaniyya or Radanites in English ) \u2013 a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing boundaries between the Franks , Muslims , Byzantines , the Rus and the Slavs .\nIn fact , they were able to reach Mesopotamia , Arabia , Persia , Central Asia \u2019 s various \u2013stans , India , perhaps Mongolia and even China .\nAs far as we can tell the Radhanites were principally traders carrying Western goods such as brocade , beaver pelts , marten , furs , swords but also ( newly minted ) eunuchs and , it appears , children \u2013 all to be sold into slavery .\nFrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aloe wood , camphor , cinnamon , celadon , silk ( this was before the Italians took over production ) and other products of the Orient .\nIn a way they were a more modest precursor to the Hanseatic League , the British East India Company or today \u2019 s corporations \u2013 a trading guild ( or perhaps just a loose network of trading associates ) whose members likely served as both merchants , explorers and , likely , spies for the local potentates .\nIt is possible that Ibrahim Ibn Ya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d of this group \u2013 we will likely never know for sure ( the fact that , when visiting Germany , he was surprised to see some of the Eastern wares and coins in the local markets , e.g.\n, in Mainz \u2013 suggests that perhaps he was more of a diplomat traveler than a trader himself ) .\nWhat the origin of the name is another mystery [ likely propaganda ] ( Frankish , Rhodan River ?\nThe city of al-Rayy/Rhages in Persia ?\nRhadan , a province in Persia or Mesopotamia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Slavic Rodanice ?\nOr Rod-a-niya ( as in , ominously ( ! )\n, \u2018 destroyer \u2019 of the \u2018 clan \u2019 ) ? )\nand much ink has been spilled on this topic\u2026 ( Moshe Gil \u2019 s \u201c Jews in Islamic Countries in the Middle Ages \u201d contains some of the latest attempts at shedding light on this ) .\nAs regards slaves , the Radhanites themselves being principally intermediaries dealing in all kinds of merchandise , were not the ones who would capture human cargo \u2013 rather for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various local monarchs and raiders .\nWe must remember that slavery never died out with the collapse of the Roman Empire and as the Franks and then the newly-added Saxons began to fight the Polabian Slavs , a surplus of prisoners of war would most profitably be disposed off by selling them into slavery .\nIn this fashion your enemies would never be heard from again and you would make a lot of money \u2013 a win win so to speak .\nSimilarly , local monarchs were no doubt to cash in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political opponents on long-deserved vacations ( see Bretislav in Bohemia who permitted the slave trade in Prague some one hundred years after the official adoption of Christianity ) .\nFinally , you had the various raiding nomads who continued to plague Ukraine and Russia much as the various Scythian and Sarmatian tribes before or the Mongols , Turks and Tartars after .\nOne such group was the south-Caspian based Khurasan .\nBut another one that we now come to , one that monopolized all channels of commerce ( downstream and upstream , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 most likely Varangians ( much more on that later ) .\nTheir reach was more limited than that of the Radhanites but they also penetrated far : first on the Dnieper then into the Black Sea and then all the way to Constantinople ; or , sometimes , on the Volga to the Caspian Sea and all the way to Baghdad .\nUnlike the Radhanites , the Rus captured their wares at their point of origin and delivered them all the way down to the final end users .\nThey sold beaver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as swords but also Slavs .\nThey traveled through the Khazar Khaganate and the Byzantine Empire selling some of their goods there and paying customs duties to the local rulers as they traveled even further .\nWhile the Radhanites were likely to have to hire guards for their long voyages , the Rus were both merchants and guards .\nThey liked to do things on their own and , one may conjecture , that the Rus \u2019 ultimate decision to get themselves \u201c invited \u201d to rule the Slavs ( after first being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PVL so diplomatically puts it , was simply an attempt to formalize the Rus-Slav relationship in a legal framework of \u201c ownership \u201d so as to enable the Rus to collect their bounty directly without having to resort to bothersome raiding activity .\nIt is also noticeable that , as the furs , swords , honey , wax , amber and Slavic slaves were sent to the East , the traders brought ( in addition to bartered goods ) tons of Abbasid silver dirham coins back with them , fueling the economic revitalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading collapse that occurred in the wake of the fall of the Western Roman Empire .\nThe first report comes from Ibn Khurradadhbih ( c 820 \u2013 c 911 ) and was written sometime between 840s-880s , however , it may be that what he describes relates to an earlier period perhaps in the beginning of the IX century .\nIbn Khurradadhbih was in the intelligence business working as a spymaster in the Persian province of Jibal ( his official title being the director of the Abbasid Bureau of Posts and Intelligence ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caliph Mu \u2019 tamid .\nHe is also the author of \u201c The Book of Roads and Kingdoms \u201d and that is where we find this first report .\nThe second report is one by Ibn al-Faqih ( c 903 ? )\nof Hamadan ( we have no idea who he was ) and has been dated to 903 .\nIbn al-Faqih almost certainly copied portions of the earlier Ibn Khurradadhbih report as will become clear to the readers .\nIt appears that what little survives of his writings is in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monumental treatise which , alas , has been lost to us ( it seems ) .\nFaqih \u2019 s report is also curious because , while the first report ( which predates Rurik \u2019 s takeover of Slavic tribes of later Russia ) , arguably , describes the Rus and the Slavs as separate [ but maybe not see below ] , the latter report calls apparently the same people just Slavs .\nThird , as it seems to topically fit in here , we include a report by Ibn Hawqal ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 920 \u2013 c 988 ; edited Istakhri \u2019 s Book of Roads and Kingdoms which was in turn an edition of Ibn Khurradadhbih \u2019 s version ) regarding the trade in slaves and Slavic eunuchs which was written sometime before the year 988 .\nWe note that there had been Slavs around his home town of Nisibis ( albeit in a military capacity ) already a century and a half before his writings .\nFinally , we present a report on the Rus and Slavs by Ibn Rusta ( circa 903 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a multi-volume encyclopedia of geography and history .\nIn terms of the organization , we start with reports on the Radhaniya and their trade routes , follow it up with a note on the eunuch trade and then go into the excerpts dealing with the Rus and the Slavs .\nWe note , up front , that the name for Slavs in Arabic is Saqaliba .\nFinally , note too that where possible we provide current place names but only once \u2013 if you can \u2019 t locate these in the text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any corresponding contemporary names ( meaning you should know where the place is or what it is without help from us ) .\n\u201c The routes of the Jewish merchants called al-Radhaniya ; these merchants they speak Arabic , Persian , Greek , Latin , Frankish , Andalusian and Slavic .\nThey journey from west to east , from east to west , traveling by land and by sea .\nFrom the west they export eunuchs [ more on that later \u2013 these were largely Slavic captives brought to Al-Andalus ] , young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pelts , marten and other furs and also swords.\n\u201d \u201c They set sail from Firanja [ the land of the Franks ? ]\non the Mediterranean coast and then head for Farama in Egypt [ Tell el-Farama , on the Mediterranean Coast , in the delta north of Suez ] .\nThere they transfer their merchandise to the backs of camels and travel to Qulzum [ former Clysma , at the southern end of the Suez Canal ] on the Red Sea , a distance of 25 forsakes [ parsecs ? ]\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the Red [ Eastern ] Sea to al-Jar , the port of Medina , and to Jiddah/Gudda [ Jeddah ] , the port of Mecca .\nThen they continue on to Sindh [ in Pakistan ] , India and China.\n\u201d \u201c They return from China with musk , alloe wood , camphor , cinnamon and other eastern products , docking again at Qulzum , then proceed to Farama , from where they again set sail on the Mediterranean [ Western ] Sea.\n\u201d \u201c Some of them head for Constantinople to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others go to the palace of the King of Franks .\nSometimes these Jewish merchants set sail on the Mediterranean from the land of the Franks to Antioch [ then in Muslim hands before a reconquista in 969 by the Byzantines ; now under Turkish administration ] .\nThey then proceed overland to al-Jabiya on the Euphrates , a journey of three days [ somewhere in Syria \u2013 East of Antioch ] .\nThey sail down the Euphrates to Baghdad , then down the Tigris to al-Ubulla [ East of Basra in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulf \u201c gateway \u201d to India ] , from where they sail the Arabian Gulf to Oman , Sindh , India and China .\nAll these lands are connected to one another.\n\u201d \u201c The overland routes of the Radhaniya are as follows ; the Jewish merchants also follow a land route .\nMerchants departing from Spain or France sail to as-Sus al-aqsa [ southern Morocco ] and then to Tangier , from where they set off for Ifriqiyya [ Tunisia/Tripolitania ] and then to Misr the Egyptian [ capital ] .\nFrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Israel ? ]\n, visit Damascus , Kufa [ on the Euphrates in Iraq ] , Baghdad and Basra [ southern Iraq ] , then cross the Ahwaz [ in Persia ] , Farz [ Persia ] , Kirman [ Kerman , Persia ] , Sindh and India , and finally arrive in China.\n\u201d \u201c Sometimes they take a route north of Rome , heading for Khamlij [ likely Atil close to the Caspian Sea shore ] via the lands of the Saqaliba ( Slavs ) .\nKhamlij is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They sail the Caspian Sea , make their way to Balkh [ in Bactria \u2013 today \u2019 s Afghanistan ] , from there to Ma wars an\u2013nahr [ Transoxiana or Bactria , e.g , where the city of Samarkand is ] , then to the yurt [ Wurt ] of the Toghuzghuz [ somewhere in Uighur countries or Mongolia \u2013 Toquz Oghuz means the ( Turkish ) Nine Tribes ] and there to China.\n\u201d \u201c Someone tells that it is stated in the Torah that Rayy [ Persian , close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports of the earth and the place of commerce for mankind .\n[ note that ray \u2013 also is Slavic for paradise ] \u2026 Rayy has a fine climate and its buildings are marvelous .\nIt is the gate of commerce , the refuge of those seeking liberty , the bridegroom of the Earth [ ? ]\n, the highway of the world .\nIt lies mid-way between Khurasan [ northeast Persia ] , Jurjan [ aka Gurgan in Persia on the Southeastern coast of the Caspian Sea ] , Iraq and Tabaristan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] .\nIt is the most beautiful creation on Earth .\nIt has the Surr and Sarban [ presumably meaning those of the Pashtuns but there is always the question of the origin of the Serbs ] quarters , and to it flows merchandise from Armenia , Azerbaijan , Khurasan , Khazaria and the country of the Burjan [ Bulgar \u2013 probably of the Volga variety ] .\n\u201d [ here the account begins to resemble what we know from Ibn Khurradadhbih ] \u201c Merchants sail from east to west and west to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk from the land of the Franks to al-Farama .\nThen they sail from Qulzum and cross the sea to China , carrying these products .\nThen they carry cinnamon and celadon and all the products of China until they come back to Qulzum and cross to al-Farama .\nThese are Jewish merchants .\nThey speak Persian , Greek , Arabic and Frankish .\nThey embark from al-Farama and sell the musk and aloes wood as well as everything they have brought with them from the kingdom of the Franks .\nThen they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baghdad and then to al-Ubulla.\n\u201d [ on the Tigris River , south of Badhdad ] Ibn Hawqal on the Trade in Eunuchs \u201c The country of the Saqaliba [ country of the Slavs ] is so immense that on the East side it delivers slaves to Korassan , whereas on the West side it sends them to Andalusia .\nThe Andalusians buy them in Galicia , in France , in Lombardy and in Calabria so as to make the eunuchs , and thereafter they ferry them over to Egypt and Africa .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world come from Andalusia.\n\u201d \u201c A well-known export from al-Andalus [ Iberian peninsula , Spain , Portugal ] is slaves , boys and girls captured in France and Galicia , as well as eunuchs from the Saqaliba .\nAll the Saqaliba eunuchs in the world come from al-Andalus .\nThey are castrated near this country .\nThe [ cutting ] operation is performed by Jewish merchants [ Radhanites ] .\nThe Saqaliba [ Slavs ] are descended from Japheth [ one of the three sons of Noah ] .\nTheir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very great length .\nRaiders from Khurasan [ or Khorassan ] reach them through the territory of the Bulghars .\nThey are led in captivity to that province.\n, their manhood left intact , their bodies unmutilated .\nThe territories of the Saqaliba are immense .\nThe arm of the sea which extend from the Ocean into the lands of Gog and Magog crosses their territory all the way to a point west of Trebizond [ Trabzon , east of Paphlagonia on the Black Sea in today \u2019 s Turkey ] then to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halves .\nOne of these , throughout all its length is raided by the warriors of Khurasan , who live on its borders , while the northern regions are invaded by raiders from al-Andalus via Galicia , France , Lombardy* and Calabria.\n\u201d In another translation this text continues \u201c so as to make the eunuchs , and thereafter they ferry them over to Egypt and Africa.\n\u201d [ See Ibn Khurradadhbih above on the same route ] Finally , he also says of the people of Khwarezm or Chorasmia : [ East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] \u201c Their entire wealth comes from trading with the Turks and from livestock .\nOne imports to them the greater part of the Slavic and Khazar slaves and slaves from the bordering lands in addition to Turkish slaves and furs from the Korsak foxes , sables , foxes , beavers and other types of furs.\n\u201d * Incidentally , Lombardy meant all of northern Italy all the way to Rome .\nIn fact , in the Life of Saint Zachary we have , under the year 747 , an entry indicating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and then delivered them to Saracen countries .\nWhen the papal and imperial edicts forbade this practice , the Venetians began to use Adriatic and Mediterranean pirates to acquire slaves and hand them over to the Venetians .\nMany of these slaves came from the Eastern shores of the Adriatic where we know slaves were traded as late as the 15th century in , for example , Dubrovnik .\nHowever , in case you ask , it is highly unlikely that it is for this reason that those Slavs living in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that name appears in many places and predates the events described here .\n[ Ibn Hawqal concludes this chapter with a piece of good news ] \u201c Captives from these regions are still plentiful [ ! ]\n\u201d \u201c The routes of the Rus merchants are as follows ; the Rus , one of the Saqaliba people , journey from the farthest reaches of Saqlab [ the land of the Slavs ] to the eastern Mediterranean and there sell beaver and black fox pelts , as well as swords .\nThe Byzantine ruler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchandise .\nOn their return they go by sea to Samkarsh , the city of the Jews [ Tamatarkha , former Greek colony on the Black Sea off of the Crimea ; then in the Khazar Khaganate \u2013 today in Russia ] , and from there make their way back to Slavic territory [ ? ]\n.\nThey also follow another route , descending the Don ( Tanais ) River , the river of the Saqaliba , and passing by Khamlij , the capital/city of the Khazars , where the ruler of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them .\nThere they embark upon the Caspian Sea , heading for a point they know .\nThis sea is 500 forsakes [ parsecs ? ]\nlong [ in diameter ] .\nSometimes they transport their merchandise on camel back from the city of Jurjan to Baghdad .\nThere Slavic speaking eunuchs interpret for them .\nThey [ the Rus ] pretend to be Christians and , like them [ Christians ] only pay a poll tax.\n\u201d \u201c Regarding the Saqalib merchants , they bring fox and beaver pelts from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the Byzantine king imposes a ten percent tax on them .\nThen they go by sea to \u201c Samkarsh of the Jews \u201d [ Tamatarkha , former Greek colony on the Black Sea off of the Crimea ; then in the Khazar Khaganate \u2013 today in Russia ] .\nFrom there , they either go on to the Saqaliba or take the way from the sea of the Saqaliba to the river of the Saqaliba ( Don or Volga ? )\n, until they come to the gulf of the Khazars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off ten percent .\nThen they go to the sea of Khurasan ( the Caspian Sea ) , usually disembarking at Jurjan , where they sell all their goods , which are then sent to Rayy , and the most amazing thing si that this is the emporium of the world.\n\u201d Ibn Rusta on the Rus ( and Slavs ) \u201c The Rus ( Rusiya ) live on an island in a lake .\nThis island is three days \u2019 march across and consists of forests and thickets .\nIt is pestilential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a man steps on it , it quivers underfoot .\nThey have a ruler called khagan Rus .\nThe Rus raid the Saqaliba , sailing in their ships until they come upon them .\nThey take them captive and sell them in Khazaran and Bulkar ( Bulghar ) .\nThey have no cultivated fields and they live by pillaging the land of the Saqaliba.\n\u201d [ the island may be at Gorodische where Volkhov comes out of Lake Ilmen \u2013 aka [ ? ]\nHolmgarthr ] It is clear that various raiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove into Slavic lands from both West and East .\nThe people captured were then taken to processing centers \u2013 such as Prague and then towards slave markets of al-Andalus or similar establishments in the Middle East .\nSaint Adalbert ( Voytech ) recommends the freeing of slaves to Boleslav II of Prague \u2013 slave traders sporting fashionable hats \u2013 slaves sporting leashes \u2013 source \u201c Gniezno doors \u201d reliefs Some were castrated and sold off as eunuchs \u2013 note , for example , the above reference about Slavic eunuchs serving interpreters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others were taken far into Muslim lands ( e.g.\n, the above mentioned Slavic eunuchs serving as interpreters in far off Baghdad ) , perhaps as far as the Arabian peninsula and , maybe , even further onto India and China .\nSome Slavic eunuchs thrived in their new environs functioning as dispassionate schemers and machers Of course for the wheels of medieval globalization to turn you needed a number of factors to work just right .\nTo others , their new circumstances proved more of a shock First , as elsewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to have a bunch of relatively hapless people who were isolated and ignorant of the wider world \u2013 preferably not speaking the language of the lands they were heading to .\nThese could be locals but , importantly , they could be strangers as in prisoners of war from other countries .\nSecond , you had to have brigand-raiders that would carry off the cargo .\nThese included the various Arabs ( and Muslims in general ) , the Rus , the Avars , likely also \u2013 at least initially \u2013 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turks \u201d ) and the already mentioned Khurasan .\nAs mentioned already , a great force in this trade seem to have been the Franks and , especially , the Saxons , who after ( and during ) their conversion to Christianity found a new cause in establishing marches for the Franks* among the various border tribes of the Slavs \u2013 their excursions into Polabian Slav lands were reminiscent of the later Reisen of the Teutonic Knights through the lands of the Old Prussians .\n* The brutalization of the Saxons by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -may have contributed to their subsequent brutalization of the Slavs \u2013 no doubt psychologists might have something to say about this .\nKhurasan raiders looking for slaves in a smoldering Slav village Third , things , no doubt , went more smoothly if you had coopted the local elites into this business .\nThese rulers and traders may have been looking for ways to boost their income and the rise of the various local standing \u201c armies \u201d may , perhaps , at least in part , been fueled by human chattel .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ coinage from this time in Central and Eastern Europe may too attest to this phenomenon .\nWhat can \u2019 t escape notice is that it was the continued willingness of Europeans to sell their countrymen ( though not always countrymen , e.g.\n, Franks selling Saxons , Franks and Saxons selling Slavs , one Slavic tribe selling members of another Slavic tribe ) into slavery , that was a driver of this process ( as much a backbone of this slave trade as the willingness of African chieftains to do the same a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of \u201c Christians \u201d selling other Christians to \u201c Jews \u201d was raised by Bishop Agobard of Lyons while otherwise complaining ( including about the fact that Jewish preachings were better received \u2013 by Christians \u2013 than Christian ones ) to Louis the Pious ( in 826-827 ) ( though the bishop did not similarly object to the sale of pagan slaves \u2013 perhaps he felt that would weaken his argument to a Christian ruler or perhaps he cared less ) .\n* More than a century later , in 948 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Verdun was a center of castration as the residents could make more money selling eunuchs to Al-Andalus rather than \u201c regular \u201d slaves .\n** Later , further East , Thietmar reports of the accusations of selling people ( \u201c to the Jews \u201d \u2013 again , presumably , the act of selling your own to others seemed worse ) being lobbied against Margrave of Meissen , Gunzelin of Kuckenburg in 1009 .\nSee also the Life of Saint Adalbert .\nAnother slave-dealing report dates even to the much-later times of Boleslaw III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of those reports Jewish merchants are mentioned but we know that it was the Czech rulers who sold Poles , Pomeranian dukes who sold Obodrites ( to Poles , Sorbs and Czechs ) , etc .\nIn fact , another Spanish-Jewish traveler , Benjamin of Tudela , makes the following observation ( as late as the 1170s ) : \u201c Thence extends the land of Bohemia , called Prague .\nThis is the commencement of the land of Slavonia , and the Jews who dwell there call it Canaan , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] sell their sons and their daughters to the other nations.\n\u201d While Benjamin \u2019 s sources here \u201c may not have been entirely objective , \u201d all evidence indicates that the maligned \u201c Jews \u201d \u2013 presumably , meaning the Radhanite merchants \u2013 served the same middleman role in the trade of human chattel as in the international trade of their other wares .\nWhile the Radhanites \u2019 behaviour was clearly terrible by today \u2019 s ( Western ) standards , the role of the sellers and buyers who happened to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( though some \u201c ultimate \u201d buyers may have been Jewish ) sometimes seems to be ignored \u2013 which is , let \u2019 s just say , \u201c odd \u201d ( thus no one seems to be blaming the \u201c Swedes \u201d for the acts of the Rus slave raiders even though they actually enslaved free people in the first place ; same for the Franks and Saxons or other fellow Slavs ) ) .\nWithout excusing anyone \u2019 s behaviour , one has to say that the slave trade was an acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benjamin \u2019 s sources \u2019 reference to Canaan originated from a different background is another story ) .\n* The council of Meaux-Paris in 845-846 did express concern about some pagan slaves : \u201c ( LXXVI ) Ut mercatores huius regni , christiani sive Iudei , mancipia pagana , qu\u0119 per tot populos et civitates fidelium transeuntes ad manus infidelium et sevissimorum hostium nostrorum perducunt , ex quo et ipsi infelices servi , qui , si a christianis emerentur , poterant salvari , miserabiliter pereunt et inimicorum regni maximus numerus augetur , coerceantur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fines vendere conpellantur , ne tam horrenda crudelitate et aperta infidelitate et animarum dampnis deus exasperetur et vires hostibus augeantur.\n\u201d ** \u201c Carzimasium autem Greci vocant amputatis viribilus et virga puerum eunuchim ; quod Verdunenses mercatores ob immensum lucrum facere , et in Hispaniam ducere solent.\n\u201d ( Liutprand , Antapodosis , seu rerum per Europam gestarum , 6 , 6 ) Fourth , you had to have initial processing centers such as Prague and other places \u2013 maybe in Khazaria or Rus .\nWe know that Prague got rather rich on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is involved , morals , too often give way to rationalization .\nAs per Ibrahim Ibn Ya \u2019 qub : \u201c The Rus and the Saqaliba go [ to Prague ] from Cracow , to trade , and so do Muslim merchants from the lands of the Turks , as well as Turks and Jews , with [ mathaquil al-marqatiyya [ ? ]\nweights [ ? ]\n] .\nThey carry away slaves , tin and various kinds of furs.\n\u201d Fifth , you had to have distribution centers closer to ultimate markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final product would be prepared for retail ( e.g.\n, the castration business above ) \u2013 then sold off to customers or shipped even further .\nSixth , you had to have a shipping/distribution network of traders/merchants who would be willing to take on such cargo \u2013 such as that of the Rus or of the more specialized al-Radhaniya ( which , along with its successors , continued in the business well into the middle ages in Bohemia , Poland and Germany ) .\nOf course , most importantly , you also had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soldiers , sex slaves or servants .\nSlavic slaves offered something for everyone While slaves were clearly not the only export of Slavic lands and neither were Slavs the only slaves ( see reference above to French and Spanish child slaves ) of the time , the extent of this trade seems to suggest that significant parts of the non-Slavic world may today have Slavic ancestors ( unless , of course , the arrivals were eunuchs ) .\nIt is no wonder that the Latin word servitor was replaced at this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those people who were , in effect , outmatched from birth by these global networks so as to be stolen from their families and their lands , forever , and sent to places that neither they nor any of their countrymen ( including their initial wholesellers ) likely ever dreamt of , suggests that , perhaps , at least in some cases , Slavic state formation may have been a defense mechanism against this kind of human poaching .\nWe also note that , at least some of the warrior slaves or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fate and , in relative terms , prospered in their new \u201c homelands.\n\u201d As mentioned before , there is at least one report of a Slav warrior band revolt somewhere in today \u2019 s Morocco where the mutineers set up their own town \u2013 known as the \u201c village of the Slavs \u201d .\nWe will return with some positives of what happened to some of these peoples in the future ( there are a number of interesting reports ! )\n.\nObviously the fate of those who were brought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all , children ) to satisfy the prurient or deviant desires of local elites was , ahem , not so pleasant even if some may have ultimately won freedom somehow ( some may have escaped ) .\nThe end of the Radhanite age The fall of the Tang Dynasty of China in 908 and the destruction of the Khazar Khaganate some sixty years later led to widespread chaos in Inner Eurasia , the Caucasus and China .\nTrade routes became unstable and unsafe , a situation exacerbated by Turkic invasions of Persia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silk Road largely collapsed for centuries .\nMoreover , the fragmentation of the Islamic world ( and to a lesser extent , Christendom ) into small states provided more opportunities for non-Jews to enter the market .\nThis period saw the rise of the mercantile Italian city-states , especially Genoa , Venice , Pisa , and Amalfi , who viewed the Radhanites as unwanted competitors .\nThe economy of Europe was profoundly affected by the disappearance of the Radhanites .\nFor example , documentary evidence indicates that many spices in regular use during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European tables in the 900s .\nJews had previously , in large parts of Western Europe , enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the spice trade .", "author": "Our Spirit", "url": "https://aim4truth.org/2022/10/31/cat-report-753/", "published": "Mon, 31 Oct 2022 19:31:06 +0000", "published_utc": 1667259066,
