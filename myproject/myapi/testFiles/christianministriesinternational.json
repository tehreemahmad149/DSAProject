fossils vs fossilized soft tissue", "content": "When a scientific report or an article commentary refers to soft tissue being preserved in a fossil , this could refer to one of two largely separate things ( A or B below ) : \u2022 The \u2018 Mary Schweitzer-type \u2019 discoveries , where some of the actual ( original ) soft tissue is still present , with such things as actual softness/stretchiness once the mineral matrix is dissolved , intact cells , and importantly , identifiable intact proteins such as collagen , osteocalcin , DNA .\n( The fact that they can be identified means that a good portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protein has not \u2018 fallen apart \u2019 . )\nSee Dinosaur soft tissue and protein\u2014even more confirmation !\nIn fact , the majority of reports that refer to soft tissue being preserved , even where they talk of it being \u2018 amazing \u2019 and/or \u2018 rare \u2019 , are in a different category , namely they simply mean to tell us that : \u2022 The shape/outline/features of what was soft tissue can be readily seen .\nFor example , amazement is expressed that a fossil recognizably shows the structural features of something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the skin , often in great detail .\nBut the actual soft tissue is no longer present .\nWording like soft tissue being \u2018 preserved \u2019 or \u2018 present \u2019 , or \u2018 fossilized soft tissue \u2019 usually does not mean to say that components of the actual original tissue were present .\nIt generally means that components that were once soft tissue are \u2018 preserved as stone \u2019 .\nThis is through the originally soft tissues being permineralized ( or totally replaced by mineral ) , or an impression left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may be a \u2018 cast \u2019 of such an impression , including possibly a 3D cast of the whole organ , as the cavity left behind after it decayed was replaced/filled with mineral .\nConsider : articles about fossils in general may refer to the bones of a skeleton being \u2018 preserved \u2019 without meaning thereby that they are claiming the original bone matrix and proteins are still present .\nEqually , reports of \u2018 amazing soft tissue preservation \u2019 are usually just referring to soft tissues preserved in stone .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common situation where only the bones of a creature were preserved ( as stone , in effect ) , much less commonly the soft tissue is also preserved ( again , as stone in effect ) .\nI.e .\n\u2018 preserved \u2019 in these instances does not mean \u2019 preserved as intact or original soft tissue \u2019 .\nNote that in the case of B , it is referring to actual appearances\u2014e.g.\n, something that looks like the shape of a part of the brain , or the liver , or skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea from the petrified body parts what their shape would have been like in life .\nIn contrast , A-type discoveries may not even look like part of a soft tissue organ\u2014e.g.\n, the original Schweitzer-type discoveries were in a piece of leg bone from an otherwise unremarkable T. rex fossil .\nOf course , it is possible to have a combination of A and B .\nThus , instances of B-type reports may have yet-undetected actual proteins in the fossil .\nThey may not have tested for actual soft tissue , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such preservation occurs , and finds receive favourable publicity .\nIn fact , therefore , if any of the many \u2018 soft tissue preserved in fossil \u2019 reports we see nowadays were explicitly referring to an intact piece of actual soft tissue , the report would likely trumpet that loudly , as the find would be even more sensational .\nIt would/should therefore be reasonably obvious from the original paper which type of preservation is involved .\nThe scientific literature on fossils , particularly dinosaurs , has started to refer to some type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissue ( even calling the specimen as a whole a \u2018 dinosaur mummy \u2019 ) \u2014even though the tissue in question is preserved as stone in the usual type B way.1 This is unfortunate , as mummified would normally be meant to imply that the original tissue is still present , only preserved through , e.g.\n, dessication ( drying ) .\nIt seems to be an attempt to explain the beautiful preservation , which even secular researchers usually admit requires rapid burial , by suggesting that it was mummified before being ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to creation and the Flood These two categories , A and B , actually involve two separate ( though related ) creation arguments and evidences .\n\u2022 Of course , even where there are no preserved soft tissue features , a bonebed full of the largely articulated2 fossil skeletons of large dinosaurs is also evidence for rapid processes .\nThis is because , if it took years and years to fossilize the skeleton , it would at the least be disarticulated ( i.e.\n, the bones would fall away from each other ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is additional \u2018 icing on the cake \u2019 evidence for rapid burial .\nHowever , it is of course true that there may be chemical and other reasons why some Flood-burial environments are more likely to preserve soft tissue , rather than just the bones , or fine details ; like the famous Solnhofen limestone ( see this example ) .\nIn other words , where , for instance , the details of the appearance of the skin were preserved in a dinosaur fossil , that does not necessarily mean they were buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular graveyard of fossil skeletons .\nBut it still , obviously , speaks of rapid burial or else those preserved soft tissue features would decay before being fossilized .\nNote that type B soft tissue preservation is not in and of itself an argument against millions of years , other than in the sense that rapid burial gives support to Flood geology in general , and a global Flood washes away the \u2018 millions of years \u2019 .\n\u2022 None Type A reports are primarily evidence against the fossils being tens-of-millions of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these substances just should not be there anymore .\nEvidence of rapid burial in addition would be largely incidental to this argument , in that if the evolutionist/long-ager were claiming that they were slowly buried , it would make it even harder to explain the undecayed tissues .\nReports of soft tissue preservation in fossils feature regularly in the scientific literature .\nSoft tissue preservation can mean one of two different things .\nBoth of them are relevant and important to the creation/evolution issue , and both are encouraging to biblical creationists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be written in such a way that readers are not likely to conflate the two issues .\nFor one thing , a failure to bring clarity could potentially weaken a person \u2019 s witness to an informed person familiar with the original report .", "author": "", "url": "https://creation.com/a/16131",

through his church \u2019 s monthly markets stall , which features his unique dinosaur artwork\u2014inspired by the Bible , and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds , and articles from Creation magazine .\nSteve became a speaker for Creation Ministries International in Australia in 2019 .\nSteve became interested in exploring the Christian faith around 1990 when he met a pastor/street evangelist in Cairns ( Far North Queensland ) who invited him to his church .\nWhile Steve was not interested in attending , he nonetheless asked for a Bible so that he could explore the Christian faith for himself .\nThe pastor gave him an NIV New Testament which Steve studied over the next year and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 Corinthians 15 , he became acutely aware that he was a sinner before a holy God , and that night he trusted in Jesus and committed his life to Him .\nReceiving Christ prompted Steve to purchase a complete Bible and start from the beginning .\nHe was immediately impacted by Genesis 1:31\u2014it was clear to him that God is good and that His creation was originally \u201c very good \u201d .\nSteve notes that \u201c history may be divided into two parts\u2014before Adam sinned , and after Adam sinned.\n\u201d This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s witnessing as a new Christian .\nLike most others who give their lives to Christ as adults , Steve had been educated on evolutionary principles , and hence he pondered the idea of man only appearing after billions of years .\nHe found Scripture taught otherwise : Such passages , along with the genealogical records of Genesis 5 and Luke 3 , \u201c convinced me of the truth of young earth creation \u201d .\nCreation is thus foundational to Steve \u2019 s evangelistic activity in Gladstone , where he lives .\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stall at the local monthly markets held at the city \u2019 s beautiful Botanic Gardens .\nFeaturing Steve \u2019 s dinosaur sketches on the theme \u2018 Dinosaurs of Eden \u2019 , as well as images of dinosaur soft tissue finds and ancient depictions of dinosaur-like creatures , the stall attracts considerable attention from the public .\nSteve and the team use these illustrations to show that science , history and the Bible all align with a young Earth .\nThis in turn lays a foundation for sharing that : It was the sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that resulted in death and suffering and the broken world we live in today , and our only hope is in the last Adam , the Lord Jesus Christ ( 1 Corinthians 15:45 ) .\nHe not only died for our sins on the Cross but also conquered death through His physical resurrection , and one day He will return to bring in a New Heaven and a New Earth , restored to Edenic perfection .\nWhat delighted me when I first met Steve M\u00fcller was seeing his sketches of dinosaurs in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other dinosaur artists , he draws dinosaurs with people , mammals , and modern birds .\nFor example , I have a print of his of a T. rex ( his favourite dinosaur ) chasing a chicken\u2014a humorous dig at the evolutionary belief that dinosaurs evolved into birds .\nSteve expressed that he sketches dinosaurs in these situations so as to challenge popular evolutionary assumptions .\nHe says his sketches provoke questions and provide many talking points and witnessing opportunities .\nSome of his dinosaur art has been enlarged and printed on big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully worded statements of fact designed to arouse curiosity .\nPeople can read these signs while standing outside the stall , and if they \u2019 re interested they can come in and find out more .\nSteve \u2019 s dinosaur art is a

to related articles on creation.com .\nWhile he was for many years a Christian teacher and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on creation in weekly chapel messages .\nHe endeavoured to instil a biblical worldview in staff

articles and can \u2019 t find much regarding past life regression , evidences of reincarnation , Jesus and his relation to the Essenes and their teachings , the books and claims of Dolores Cannon , etc .\nA person I know has jumped into this hook , line , and sinker .\nThey were a Christian for a long time , but now they are searching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lots of new age/ Kabbalah like/ mid-eastern spirituality .\nIt actually has threads of the Emerging Church and Rob Bell \u2019 s teaching about experiencing God , and how that experience trumps the Bible\u2014and how in the end love wins .\nThis person hasn \u2019 t met any Christian who has reviewed the past life regression/ Jesus and the Essenes books/ teachings and can speak knowledgeably as to their flaws .\nI \u2019 m proceeding cautiously to review the matter .\nI can certainly send this gentleman the Alien Intrusion movie , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I search the web for any real detailed Christian analysis of these things , I only find a few articles , and they all say the same thing : the memories are false , and the person might be demonically influenced .\nThey make clear that the Bible teaches reincarnation doesn \u2019 t happen .\nGot it .\nI believe that too , and that it isn \u2019 t true .\nWhat I \u2019 m looking for to help him is a more in-depth review of all such things which break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c supporting \u201d evidences for past life regression and related .\nFor instance , it \u2019 s likely that many of the memories actually occurred and are accurate recollections of the past , yet I can \u2019 t find clear teachings from leading Pastors about that .\nI assume they just believe demons gave them that knowledge .\nMaybe they are all uninterested and just chalk it all up to demonic influence .\nHopefully you understand the request .\nAnything you can point to would be much appreciated .\nThanks for writing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Essenes I have listened to Cannon \u2019 s claims via a few YouTube videos of her old radio broadcasts to get an idea of what her ideas are .\nFirst off , the \u2018 sources \u2019 she cites from outside the \u2018 past life regressions \u2019 in support of her ideas are unreliable .\nFor instance , The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ,1 which is a theosophical2 book whose first line opens with a blatant historical blunder : \u201c Augustus Caesar reigned and Herod Antipas was ruler in Jerusalem.\n\u201d Herod Antipas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herod the Great did .\nDoes this sound like a great historical source ?\nNot so much .\nAnd there \u2019 s also The Drama of the Lost Disciples written by George F. Jowett ( 1891\u20131969 ) , who said the first ever church was in Glastonbury , England !\nJowett was a weightlifter , not a historian .\nAnd his ideas are supportive of \u2018 British Israelism \u2019 , which says the 10 \u2018 lost \u2019 tribes of northern Israel were actually Brits .\nOn that , see Is Christianity \u2018 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u2018 Christian Identity \u2019 heresy and A brief history of the Jews .\nDrawing positively on these \u2018 sources \u2019 do not inspire confidence in Cannon \u2019 s abilities as a historian .\nOn the other hand , the most likely primary source of information we have about the Essenes is from the Dead Sea Scrolls ( DSS ) ( figure 1 ) .\nMoreover , I \u2019 d encourage your friend to get a hold of an English translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls .\nThe classical Penguin version translated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , Vermes points out that the scholarly consensus on the identity of the DSS community is that they were Essenes.4 He mentions that the consensus rests on three main points : \u2022 There is no better site than Qumran to correspond to Pliny \u2019 s settlement between Jericho and Engedi .\n[ 5 ] \u2022 Chronologically , Essene activity is placed by Josephus between Jonathan Maccabeus ( c. 150 ) and the first Jewish war ( 66\u201370 ) and the sectarian occupation of the Qumran site coincide perfectly .\n[ 6 ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization , and customs are so fundamental as to render the identification of the two bodies extremely probable as long as some obvious differences can be explained.7 And Vermes notes that these discrepancies are plausibly accounted for.8 The Essenes were a movement with different strains that developed over 200 years , so it \u2019 s unlikely that Josephus captures the full scope of their beliefs and practice .\nPlus , the Qumran materials were written by insiders for insiders , while both Josephus and Pliny were essentially observers .\nAs such , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Essenism and the Qumran sect remains in my view the likeliest of all proposed solutions.\n\u201d 9 Also , note that digital copies of the Dead Sea Scrolls are now available online.10 Why does this matter ?\nIt shows that anyone can investigate the evidence for themselves and see that there is nothing directly about Christianity in the DSS .\nNothing is said about Jesus , or Peter , or James , or Paul .\nNothing even of the church in general !\nSo , the DSS are useful for getting an \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judaism from the time when Christianity first began .\n\u2018 Unvarnished \u2019 because the materials in the collection haven \u2019 t been subject to interpolations and fights between Christians and Jews over the centuries , unlike the Apocrypha , the Pseudepigrapha , and Josephus .\nAnd , in terms of understanding Christian origins , it helps us understand some of the ideas floating around in the culture Christianity was birthed in .\nBut the DSS don \u2019 t offer much more than that in relation to Christianity .\nNow , I imagine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned the Vermes English translation would be \u2018 conspiracy \u2019 !\nExcept that would make no sense .\nWhy ?\nVermes ( who was a world-renowned expert in the DSS ) was a Catholic priest who apostatized to become basically a secular Jew in 1957 ( he had fallen in love and wanted to marry ) .11 The first edition of his English translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls was published in 1962 , five years after his apostasy .\nSo , if there was anything like what Cannon and her ilk say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DSS , why would he have left it out ?\nHe wouldn \u2019 t .\nHe had every reason to discredit Christianity .\nThe only remotely plausible reason why he didn \u2019 t is that there is no such material in the DSS .\nPut simply , the picture Cannon paints of Jesus and the Essenes is pure fiction .\nIt has no basis in publicly available fact .\nSecond , why should we believe in reincarnation ?\nI wouldn \u2019 t write off the psychological or demonic explanations as mere attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed rival hypotheses that compete in explaining the same data as the reincarnation hypothesis .\nSo , the question becomes : why should we embrace the reincarnation hypothesis over these other explanations ?\nFrom the perspective of psychology , there are two fundamental problems with the reincarnation hypothesis as an explanation for these supposed \u2018 past life memories \u2019 .12 First , it underplays the ability of the mind , especially in a highly suggestive state like hypnosis , to construct its own \u2018 realities \u2019 from the vaguest and most basic notions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do this , past-life regression \u2018 therapy \u2019 may be rather unethical , since it so easily could amount to implanting false memories in a subject .\nSecond , perhaps the strongest collection of case studies supportive of reincarnation , collected by a prominent American psychiatrist Dr Ian Stevenson ( 1918\u20132007 ) , show a distinct presence of confirmation bias .\nIn other words , he had a preconceived notion and set out to catalogue cases consistent with that notion .\nHowever , he didn \u2019 t deal with the massive body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the vast majority of people have absolutely no memory of any past lives .\nBut if this weak case is the best empirical case that can be put forward for reincarnation , why should we give credence to the likes of Dolores Cannon ?\nBut , let \u2019 s say that some of the \u2018 memories \u2019 hold up under scrutiny ; i.e .\nthere \u2019 s no way the subject could \u2019 ve known what they \u2018 remembered \u2019 , and yet we have independent confirmation that what they remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of any proven instance of this , but let \u2019 s assume it for the sake of argument .\nIf this were true , I think we \u2019 d have to admit that the purely psychological explanation is hard to sustain in these instances .\nIndeed , we \u2019 d really only need one clear-cut example of this to seriously call into question any merely psychological explanation for these \u2018 past life memories \u2019 .\nHowever , evil spirits also explain this scenario .\nAfter all , they could easily have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events , and are simply using the subject to testify to them for some deceptive spiritual agenda .\nIn the case of Dolores Cannon \u2019 s collection of \u2018 past life memories \u2019 supposedly from an Essene who knew Jesus , but tells us a radically anti-New Testament message about Jesus , that would be sufficient cause to suspect deception .\nAfter all , belief in Jesus is at stake in such matters , so a lie about it could easily sway people away from eternal life .\nAnd we already know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by what we have in the New Testament , but also by what we have in the Dead Sea Scrolls .\nWhat \u2019 s the best metaphysical context for reincarnation ?\nAnd finally , what notion of reincarnation is your friend buying into ?\nThere are many different notions .\nE.g .\nare humans reincarnated into humans , or into other animals as well ?\nReincarnation is typically associated with Hinduism ( figure 2 ) , which is largely a pantheistic tradition .\nHowever , if reincarnation is literally true , pantheism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rebirth of a soul in another body \u201d .\nBut e.g .\nmy wife and I began our bodily existence at different times .\nTherefore , we are different souls .\nWe are not the same being .\nHowever , pantheism says that everything is God .\nIn other words , everything , despite appearances , is really just one being .\nBut reincarnation presupposes that two simultaneously existing bodies that began to exist at different times can not possess the same soul .\nTherefore , they can not be the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo , \u2018 reincarnation \u2019 in any pantheistic philosophy can be nothing more than a \u2018 way of speaking \u2019 ; it must be a metaphysically empty concept .\nWhich , interestingly , does fit the classical Hindu idea that the perceptual world is mere perception .\nNow , I think this idea has all sorts of problems ( What \u2019 s wrong with Hindu pantheism ? )\n, but that \u2019 s not really my point .\nMy point is that classical Hinduism can \u2019 t really embrace a literal notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with reincarnation , but mistakenly .\nAfter all , in Buddhism there isn \u2019 t really a persisting \u2018 self \u2019 that can exist from life to life .\nSo the very notion of reincarnation is meaningless in Buddhism .\nIt \u2019 s probably just a tradition carried over as baggage from Hinduism . )\nTheism , however , can .\nAfter all , what runs the whole system of which souls get reincarnated where and when ?\nThere \u2019 s also the problem of population growth : more people are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the souls coming from for the surplus people being born ?\nIt seems to me that God could solve these logistical challenges very easily : He has sufficient knowledge and power to run the whole \u2018 reincarnation machine \u2019 smoothly .\nIn comparison , there \u2019 s no guarantee that atheistic or polytheistic worldviews could provide a logistically smooth-running reincarnation schema .\nBasically , theism provides a better ground for reincarnation than any other metaphysic for many of the same reasons theism grounds science better than any other metaphysic .\nOf course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a system would be .\nI suppose it would be easy to conceive of such a system being a means by which a soul can \u2018 get another shot \u2019 at communion with God .\nIf we fail in one life , then reincarnation gives us another shot .\nMaybe we could even combine the notions of reincarnation and resurrection and say that God will resurrect everyone in the body they achieved communion with God in .\nThe interesting thing is , though , that this system likely still needs some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found gracious communion with God .\nAfter all , our sins still need dealing with , and nobody lives a sinless life in this world , no matter how many times we \u2018 travel through \u2019 .\nAnd since God doesn \u2019 t need multiple lives to \u2018 get it right \u2019 , one life with death and resurrection would suffice .\nThis would rule out the theistic traditions in Indian religious thought , since they posit multiple divine incarnations ( of multiple gods , as well ; not just the supreme reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 lack the historical verisimilitude and evidential backing of Jesus of Nazareth .\nOne potential exception is Madhva , a 13th/14th century guru ( figure 3 ) .\nHe was the founder of the Dvaita Vedanta tradition in Hindu philosophy.13 He vehemently rejected the prevailing monism in Hindu philosophy for a radically ( for India ) theistic metaphysic .\nHe posited that Vishnu was the sole supreme reality , alone independent and infinite , and everything else depended on him for its existence .\nHe also posited the separate reality of individual souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world we perceive .\nEven more , he rejected attempts at liberation by one \u2019 s own works or knowledge , and insisted that only through the grace of Vishnu and devotion to him could souls receive liberation .\nMost interestingly , devotion to Vishnu was to be mediated through Madhva as the 3rd avatar of one of Vishnu \u2019 s sons , the wind god Vayu .\nIn fact , in his works he proclaimed himself to be the 3rd avatar of Vayu.14 On the one hand , the correlations between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially in contrast to Hindu monism , are clear , numerous , and extensive .\nMoreover , Madhva was born and established his main teaching centre on the southern coast of the Indian state of Kartanaka .\nThis is right next to Kerala , an Indian state with a strong Christian presence extending back centuries before the rise of Dvaita.15 It would be surprising if such an aberrant philosophical perspective with respect to mainstream Hinduism arose in an area close to a strong Christian presence without any influence from Christian ideas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who deny any link between Dvaita and Christianity admit that Madhva \u2019 s philosophy leaves itself open to the charge.16 On the other hand , there are important differences between Dvaita and Christianity that set Christianity apart as superior ( even aside from the concerns about borrowing ) .\nFirst , Jesus claimed to be the incarnation of an element internal to the Supreme reality , whereas Madhva claimed to be the third incarnation of a dependent being fundamentally other from the Supreme reality .\nVayu was a \u2018 son of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angelic \u201c sons of God \u201d in Job 38:4\u20137 rather than Jesus in John 1 or 1 Corinthians 8:6 .\nSecond , the main \u2018 miracle \u2019 of Madhva \u2019 s life was his teaching\u2014his philosophical system as an interpretation of the Vedic scriptural material .\nSome miracles are recorded in early biographical material on Madhva.17 However , the truth of his message is never tied to the veracity of any of his miracles , unlike Jesus \u2019 resurrection , which our earliest Christian sources state the Christian faith stands or falls on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , the historical evidence for Jesus \u2019 resurrection is incredibly strong ; much stronger than it is for any of Madhva \u2019 s miracles .\nCrucially , the eyewitnesses of Jesus \u2019 resurrection lived in adversarial contexts that made continued confession of Jesus \u2019 resurrection extremely costly for them.18 Above all , Madhva gave us his teachings ; Jesus gave us His resurrection .\nFinally , consistent with His goal to facilitate communion with Himself as easily as possible ( which both Dvaita and Christianity teach ) , the Supreme reality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth to the wider world ( Deism and divine revelation ) .\nHowever , Dvaita , after 700 years , is still a minority religious tradition within Hinduism .\nIndeed , few outside of India have heard of Madhva .\nChristianity , in contrast , has always been a missionary religion expanding beyond its prevailing territorial borders , and is now after 2000 years the most populous religious tradition in the world right at the time when the world \u2019 s population exploded .\nNearly a third of the world \u2019 s current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ .\nIndeed , with such rapid population growth over the last century , it seems that many souls have been incarnated as humans for the first time in the last century .\nThus , their access to a world religion seems pretty paramount to facilitate their communion with God .\nBut this implies that Christianity is much more likely to embody an authentic divine revelation than Dvaita .\nBut of course Christianity rejects reincarnation ( Hebrews 9:27 ) .\nSo , we have a problem : the best metaphysic around for justifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have to sacrifice a great deal of plausibility in our worldview to adopt reincarnation ( i.e .\ngo back to Dvaita ) .\nAnd on what basis ?\nWhat is the evidence for reincarnation ?\nWell , as we saw , psychology and evil spirits are at least as good explanations of the best evidence cited for reincarnation as reincarnation is .\nWhat \u2019 s the take home point ?\nThere are no good reasons to believe in reincarnation .\nThe best \u2018 evidence \u2019 people have to offer is past-life regression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be skeptical of it , from both a

uniformitarian scientists regularly discover perplexing features .\nTrue to form , they almost always apply present processes over long periods of time to explain their origin .\nSometimes , the feature can not be attributed to present processes , i.e .\nit does not comply with the uniformitarian principle .\nIn these cases , a secondary hypothesis is applied , or many hypotheses are developed by different researchers .\nThese may or may not be reasonable .\nOne of these perplexing features is clastic pipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are defined as \u201c cylindrical columns of sandstone , which vertically crosscut original bedding with sharp contacts.\n\u201d 1 Some are 100 m in diameter and up to about 100 m tall.2 Up to 100 or more pipes are sometimes found in a given area ( figure 2 ) .\nOccasionally , clastic pipes contain conglomerate or breccia , as those in Kodachrome Basin State Park , Utah , USA ( figure 3 ) .\nClastic pipes are found within sediment or remain standing after the enclosing layers have eroded away .\nClastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as flaring geometries at the top and bottom,3 and concentric rings.4 Others have unusual weathering pits up to 10 m deep at the top.5 It is believed that the pipes formed at the same time as the sediment was laid down.4 Clastic pipes have been observed at many locations of the world : Clastic pipes are common throughout the Phanerozoic of the Colorado Plateau.3 Over 100 clastic pipe locations are found in southeast Utah alone.6 Uniformitarian scientists not sure how the clastic pipes formed Since sand dikes and boils are also observed after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clastic dikes must be caused by liquefaction or fluidization related to earthquake shaking.7 It is possible they are right , but the exact origin of clastic pipes still eludes them .\nSo , many hypotheses have been developed : Apparently , there are no modern analogues , which means that clastic dikes contradict the uniformitarian principle : Sand blows or boils are really not good analogs for clastic pipes since they are small scale and commonly not cylindrical in cross-section below the ground .\nCreation scientists can agree that clastic pipes likely were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the quakes would have to be extraordinarily powerful , as would be expected during the global Flood : \u201c The depth of liquefaction recorded by the pipes [ in SE Utah ] far exceeds depths usually considered in earthquake engineering.\n\u201d 10 The sediments were apparently soft during the formation of the pipes , since there was no disturbance of the surrounding sediments and no indication of compressive strain.9,11 From the uniformitarian perspective , the sediments would have had to remain soft for millions of years .\nDepending upon the precise uniformitarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have had to remain soft for a minimum of 13 Ma if the Carmel Formation averaged 179 Ma and the Entrada averaged 166 Ma.11 But if Hornbacher is correct that the pipes are Plio-Pleistocene in age , then all the sediments in the region and the hundreds of metres eroded from the area had to remain soft for about 150 Ma.9 Neither scenario is likely .\nIt is interesting that numerous pipes are found in what uniformitarian scientists consider lithified desert sands .\nFor instance , they are common in the Navajo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erg on Earth .\nThe Navajo Sandstone is considered to have accumulated in a dry sand desert.4 However , the Navajo Sandstone does have features that indicate it was not \u2018 dry \u2019 , such as widespread soft-sediment features

numerous tracks of dinosaurs and other creatures.16 Based on these observations , it is very likely that the Navajo Sandstone is not a desert sandstone , but was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way as what is now

1\u201311 among professing Christians from those which we teach .\nTherefore , it appears that it would be helpful to review basic principles of Bible interpretation and apply them to examples of interpretation of Genesis 1\u201311 .\nThis review is not intended to be an academic course in hermeneutics for seminarians .\nRather it is offered as an approach which can be applied by any Bible-believer who wishes to be a Berean\u2014that is to examine the Scriptures to determine what is true ( Acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible so that we can know what we are to believe and how we are to act The purpose of Scripture is to make us wise for salvation and equip us for every good work ( 2 Timothy 3:15\u201317 ) .\nSo , when we approach a study of a Bible passage our objective should be to know what God has chosen to say to us , because the Bible teaches \u201c what man is to believe concerning God , and what duty God requires of man.\n\u201d 1 2 .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible is the ultimate authority on everything it teaches .\nWe can know that the Bible is true because the Holy Spirit enlightens our minds and hearts so that we accept it as the word of God ( 1 Corinthians 2:13\u201314 ) .\nMoreover , it says that it is the word of God and is true ( Psalm 119:160 ; 2 Timothy 3:16 ) and Jesus declares it to be so ( Matthew 4:4 , 7 ; John 17:17 ) .\nBut how can we show that it is true if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open and honest cross-examination ( 1 Thessalonians 5:21 ) , affirms the major principles by which cross-examination should be conducted ( e.g .\nDeuteronomy 17:6 , John 5:31\u201347 , Acts 17:10 , Galatians 2:1\u201310 , 1 Thessalonians 5:21 ) , and stands up under scrutiny , so far as such tests can be applied ( see Using the Bible to prove the Bible ?\nand Jesus Christ on the infallibility of Scripture ) .\n3 .\nThe original language texts are the word of God God the Holy Spirit has ensured that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible and that the accuracy of the text has been maintained .\nOT manuscripts were hand copied with remarkable fidelity .\nThis was demonstrated with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in the late 1940 \u2019 s .\nAlthough there are differences between the text in the Dead Scrolls and the Masoretic manuscripts2 , the Dead Sea Scrolls demonstrate the consistency between the hand-copied versions that were produced during an approximately 1,000-year period and the versions that remained buried during that period .\nSimilarly , there is extensive manuscript support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Greek manuscripts .\nWhen compared together , they provide multiple witnesses to the text of every verse in the NT .\nTextual variants do exist .\nHowever , most ( ~99 % ) are insignificant , being variants in spelling or different forms of words with the same root .\nVery few of the variants , if any , can be used to argue for a different theological position than what is presented in the published texts that have been the accepted position for five hundred years of Bible translation .\nSince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full understanding of how the editors of the printed editions compared manuscripts , we need to believe that God the Holy Spirit providentially superintended the preparation of the printed editions from which the Bible has been translated so that God \u2019 s purposes for his word will be accomplished ( Isaiah 55:11 ) .\nMost people can not read the Bible in its original ( Hebrew , Aramaic , and Greek ) languages .\nThus , we are dependent on using translations for our study of God \u2019 s word .\nTranslation can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biases , word selection ( words can have shades of meanings ) , different sentence structures , and the difficulty of translating idioms and different verb forms .\nTherefore , it is wise to use multiple faithful translations when conducting an interpretive study of the Bible .\nAlso , we should avoid being dogmatic about the rendering of a particular verse where reliable translations vary .\nThe Bible is not a \u2018 cookbook \u2019 for life , giving exhaustive detail , for what to believe and how to behave .\nThis means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we read the Bible and apply it to our lives .\nIn this regard , the Westminster Confession of Faith states , \u201c The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own glory , man \u2019 s salvation , faith and life , is either expressly set down in Scripture , or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture : unto which nothing at any time is to be added , whether by new revelations of the Spirit , or traditions of men.\n\u201d 3 Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determining a correct interpretation of a passage will require deduction by \u201c good and necessary consequence \u201d .\nAccepting the preceding assumptions , we can now consider selected guidelines for Bible interpretation .\nHowever , we should note that these guidelines do not provide a checklist like that used before flying an airplane .\nThey are guidelines to assist us when we study God \u2019 s word .\nWe need to appeal to the Holy Spirit to give us wisdom when interpreting the Bible .\nThese guidelines are presented with a general hierarchical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be applied as a set when interpreting a Bible text .\nThe Bible contains several literary genres , including historical narrative , prophecy , poetry , wisdom , theological treatises , and apocalyptic .\nWhen considering Genesis 1\u201311 , the first question we need to ask , is , what is the genre of the text ?\nAn unbiased ( if one exists ) consideration of the account would conclude that Moses includes an historical narrative which flows seamlessly into the historical narrative from Abraham to Joseph in the remainder of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned by some theologians ( and most scholars who are unbelievers ) , and they place Genesis 1\u201311 into another genre , such as \u2018 myth \u2019 .\nHowever , it is purely a subjective imposition to reject this part of Scripture as providing a description of actual events that occurred in the spatial-temporal realm and to claim that it is symbolic , figurative , poetic , or whatever else .\nOnce we understand what the genre is , the next logical step is to accept the plain sense meaning of the text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Genesis 1\u201311 , this means that we are to understand the account to be relaying information about events which occurred in space-time history .\nThis understanding is supported by Jesus who accepted the plain sense of the historical narrative passages\u2014for example , the creation of Adam and Eve ( Mark 10:6\u20139 ) and Noah \u2019 s building the ark and the Flood ( Matthew 24:38\u201339 ) .\nLikewise , writers of NT books accepted the Genesis 1\u201311 account as speaking of actual historical events : \u2022 And when they heard it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , \u201c Sovereign Lord , who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them , \u2026 \u201d ( Acts 4:24 ) .\n\u2022 The God who made the world and everything in it , being Lord of heaven and earth , does not live in temples made by man , nor is he served by human hands , as though he needed anything , since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything .\nAnd he made from one man every nation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth , having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place , ( Acts 17:24\u201326 ) .\n\u2022 For they deliberately overlook this fact , that the heavens existed long ago , and the earth was formed out of water and through water by the word of God , and that by means of these the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished .\n( 2 Peter 3:5\u20136 ) .\n3 .\nDetermine the meaning for the original audience We believe , based on the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all the Bible has timeless relevance and application for everyone\u2014believer and unbeliever ( 2 Timothy 3:16\u201317 ) .\nHowever , that does not mean that the Bible was not written to a specific audience .\nFor example , Deuteronomy was given to the Israelites before they crossed the Jordan , Romans was written to churches in Rome early in Nero \u2019 s reign ( c. 55\u201357 ) , and Hebrews was written to the scattered Jews in the second half of the 1st century likely before the destruction of the Jerusalem temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to ask of the Genesis 1\u201311 passage , are : 1 ) Who was the first primary audience ?\n2 ) What did the Holy Spirit wish to communicate to them ?\nThese questions are important to answer , so that we don \u2019 t read into the text an interpretation which is not intended by the Holy Spirit .\nThe Genesis 1\u201311 account contains references which appear to indicate that it was directed initially either to pre-Noahic or to pre-Mosaic audiences .\nFor example , the location of Eden ( Genesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the current world \u2019 s topography .\nEden was destroyed during the Flood .\nLikewise , internal evidence in Genesis 10 suggests a date for its composition that is considerably earlier than the time of Moses.4 Today many Christians have a limited knowledge about the contents of the Bible .\nThis makes it difficult for them to understand passages directly or within the broader context of Scripture .\nEven though they can read , that does not necessarily mean that they have an ability to understand what they are reading .\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an article posted on CMI \u2019 s website : Most people proficient in English could smoothly read the extract but would not have a clue what the extract is talking about unless they had some familiarity with biology and genetics .\nThis illustrates why a disciplined study of the entire Bible will help us overcome our native ignorance and help us to interpret the Bible .\nWe can not obtain a full understanding of any portion of the Bible if we read or study it in isolation from the rest of the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible says about a particular topic .\nScripture must be used to interpret Scripture ( Acts 17:11 ; 2 Timothy 2:15 ; 1 Peter 1:10\u201312 ) .\nAn example of comparing Scripture with Scripture , is found in the repetition of the genealogies found in Genesis 5 and Genesis 11 in 1 Chronicles ( 1 Chronicles 1:1 , 24\u201327 ) .\nThis demonstrates that the Jews during the Persian period ( when 1 Chronicles was compiled ) accepted the genealogies as a reliable list of the ancestors of David and subsequent kings\u2014as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has been said that a \u201c text without a context is a pretext.\n\u201d 7 It means that a text can be interpreted to mean something different from the author \u2019 s original intention or can be interpreted to mean what we want it to mean .\nBoth approaches are wrong .\nTo properly interpret a verse or passage it must be understood within the context of its surrounding text\u2014paragraph , chapter , book , and the whole Bible .\nEach book of the Bible has a primary purpose and key theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sections of chapters generally focus on a particular topic or small range of topics .\nWe must remember that the overriding context of the Bible is God \u2019 s plan for redeeming the elect of mankind .\nTherefore , the primary purpose of the Bible is to reveal man \u2019 s lostness in sin and his need for a redeemer\u2014the Anointed One , the Messiah/Christ .\nThis begins explicitly in Genesis 3:15 with the announcement , in the midst of the curse on Eve \u2019 s sin , that a descendent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpret a verse within its context , it is helpful to look for : \u2022 Repeated words or phrases .\nFor example , \u201c it was good \u201d in Genesis 1 .\nThe multiple uses of \u201c it was good \u201d , reinforces the \u201c it was very good \u201d statement in Genesis 1:31 , which indicates that everything that God had made was without any imperfection or defect .\nThus , there was no disease , or decay , or death of living creatures in the universe before Adam \u2019 s sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c and he died \u201d , in Genesis 5 .\nThis reminds us of the seriousness of Adam \u2019 s sin which brought death and decay into the universe .\n\u2022 An immediate explanation .\nFor example , the words \u201c evening and morning \u201d ( Genesis 1:5 , 8 , 13 , 19 , 23 , 31 ) define the word \u2018 day \u2019 , indicating that each of the days of creation were natural days .\nWe can broaden our scope for interpreting the word \u2018 day \u2019 as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context to consider the context of similar uses in other parts of Bible .\nWe find a parallel with the use of the ordinal for the 2nd through 6th days of the creation week8 in Numbers 7:12\u201383 and Numbers 29:12\u201338 .\nThese passages refer to offerings that were made during a series of sequential days .\nNo one could seriously suggest that the days in Numbers 7 and 29 are other than natural days and that they do not follow one another as evening follows morning .\nLikewise , in Exodus 20 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should understand the meaning of the word \u2018 day \u2019 in Genesis 1 .\n\u2022 For in six days the L made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that is in them , and rested on the seventh day .\n( Exodus 20:11 ) .\nIn the Ten Commandments , God states explicitly that he created the universe over a period of six days and set aside the seventh day as a day of rest .\nThis pattern of six days of work followed by a day of rest established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Seven-Day Week ) Thus , within the immediate context and broader context , we must understand the word \u2018 day \u2019 , as it appears in Genesis 1 , to mean a natural day\u2014what we refer to as a \u2018 24-hour day \u2019 .\nWe , at CMI , have addressed alternative interpretations of the word \u2018 day \u2019 in Genesis 1.9 Every language uses figures of speech\u2014often to make statements more interesting or memorable .\nGood Bible translations deal with the challenges associated with figures of speech , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHowever , some figures of speech are more challenging to interpret , and care must be taken to derive the meaning as intended by the Holy Spirit and the human author .\nExamples include Jesus \u2019 use of hyperbole in the Sermon on the Mount .\nIn Genesis 1\u201311 , we find figures of speech .\nSome of the idioms we can understand with no translation of the idea because they have been absorbed into our linguistic culture .\nFor example , in Genesis 4:1 , the word \u2018 knew \u2019 we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 , and in Genesis 2:17 , the word \u2018 seed \u2019 is understood to mean \u2018 descendants \u2019 .\nGenesis 3:19 contains multiple figures of speech .\nWe understand the synecdoche , in which a part represents the whole , with the word \u2018 bread \u2019 to mean \u2018 food \u2019 .\nThe words \u2018 you are dust \u2019 is a metaphor for \u2018 material essence \u2019 .\nAnd there is a chiastic structure built into the latter part of the verse .\nThe words \u2018 heel \u2019 and \u2018 head \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech , which we know from later portions of Scripture to refer to the death of Jesus which was overturned by his resurrection and the destruction of Satan who is cast into the lake of fire ( Revelation 20:10 ) .\nIt is possible that the expression \u201c evening and morning \u201d can be understood as a merism , in which parts are given which encompass a whole .\nIt could also be a metonymy in which the pair of words represent a complete unit .\nIn either case , the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the word \u2018 day \u2019 used in its immediate context\u2014i.e.\n, a day in Genesis 1 , was made up of an evening and morning and was a natural day .\n7 .\nDo not read an interpretation into the text Interpreters sometimes read an interpretation into ( eisegesis ) a text rather than reading out of ( exegesis ) the text .\nFor example , it is pure eisegesis to suggest that Genesis 1:1\u20133 describes , in stylized form , a Big Bang incident.10 Similarly , to claim that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genesis 1:2 is purely speculation with a feeble attempt to defend \u2018 deep time \u2019 for geological processes to occur.11 Since verses and passages are composed of words , it is important that we understand how particular words are being used .\nSome words appear only once ( or rarely ) in the Bible .\nAn example in Genesis 1 is the word \u2018 expanse \u2019 ( Genesis 1:6 , 20 ) .\nIt occurs only in one other place ( Ezekiel 1:22 ) .\nSome interpreters have claimed that the word should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dome and that it reflects a primitive cosmology .\nThe author of Genesis 1 was supposedly applying an ancient pagan concept which shows an ignorance of modern celestial mechanics.12 However , in Genesis 1:8 , God provides a parallel definition of the word , calling it \u2018 heavens \u2019 , which can refer to the sky , the celestial realm , or heaven .\nWe must not read a meaning into a word that the author did not intend .\nWe can illustrate this using examples in modern English .\nThe word \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ESV translation in Acts 26:2 .\nHowever , this does not mean that we believe in luck ruling our destinies through the goddess Fortuna .\nLikewise , we use the terms \u2018 sunrise \u2019 ( Numbers 2:3 ; Matthew 5 ; 45 ; Luke 1:78 ) and \u2018 sunset \u2019 ( Deuteronomy 16:6 ; 1 Kings 22:36 ) without implying that we accept the Ptolemaic model of the solar system rather than the Copernican model .\nSadly , many professing Evangelicals suggest novel or esoteric interpretations of Genesis ( particularly of Genesis 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of examples .\nThese alternative interpretations have been proposed or have gained support in the Church only since naturalistic theories of cosmology , geology , and evolution arose after about 1800 .\nThey undermine God \u2019 s word and are attempts to conform to the ever-shifting teachings of men .\nThey claim to cling to biblical authority while denying the plain sense of the Bible \u2019 s teaching .\nTo interpret a verse or passage in its historical context , we must start with information which the Bible provides elsewhere that relates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , God tells Noah to take seven pairs of clean animals into the ark ( Genesis 7:2 ) .\nTo this point in the narrative , we are not informed what is meant by \u2018 clean \u2019 .\nPresumably , the pre-Flood patriarchs had been informed of the meaning .\nWe need to turn to Leviticus 11 to gain insight into the meaning of \u2018 clean \u2019 .\nOnce we have considered the biblical context , we can expand our consideration to include ancient cultural information .\nBible dictionaries can provide additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare what multiple dictionaries say , as each can have a theological bias .\nWe don \u2019 t need to have an extensive knowledge of ancient history to understand the Bible \u2019 s teachings .\nHowever , we can mistakenly assume that the historical context is so different from our own that the text no longer applies to us .\nThus , we can lose sight of today \u2019 s relevant application of a passage .\nConversely , if we ignore entirely a consideration of the historical context , we can impose our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it read something radically different from what the author intended .\nAn example is when writers suggest that there is a problem with the account of the topography of Eden ( Genesis 2:10\u201314 ) , because it mentions four large rivers .\nEden was entirely obliterated during the Flood , and attempts to find its location in the world \u2019 s current topography are futile ( Where was Eden ?\nPart 1 , Where was Eden ?\nPart 2 ) .\n9 .\nApply the wisdom of the ages For the past 2,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere have been many dangerous misinterpretations of Scripture .\nThese have included heresies such as those which appeared in the first few centuries of the NT Church ( e.g.\n, Adoptionism , Marcionism , Gnosticism , Docetism , Nestorianism , Arianism , and Pelagianism ) .\nOthers appeared during the Middle Ages .\nIn the Modern era , old heresies are constantly being reworked ( e.g.\n, Unitarianism ) and new ones have appeared ( e.g.\n, Kenosis Theory , Prosperity Gospel , and Open Theism ) .\nEarly councils , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writings of theologians ( e.g.\n, Athanasius , Augustine , Anslem , Luther , and Calvin ) have helped to steer Christian theology and Bible interpretation in an orthodox direction .\nThus , we should respect the wisdom of those of the past who have given considerable thought to the interpretation of the Bible .\nHowever , when the fathers contradict Scripture , we are to follow the teachings of the Bible .\nThis is a principle that was re-established during the Protestant Reformation .\nJesus teaches that we must not accept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of God ( Matthew 5:21 , 27 , 33 , 38 , 43 ; Mark 7:8 ) .\nWhen considering how others have interpreted a verse or passage , we must avoid the celebrity mentality ( e.g.\n, \u201c John Calvin taught \u2026 \u201d , \u201c John MacArthur says \u2026 \u201d ) .\nEven the most godly and intelligent commentator or preacher can be mistaken .\nThe believers in Berea were credited with being noble because they examined the Scriptures daily to see if the things being taught by Paul were correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have only one final authority for all truth\u2014the Bible .\nWe must also avoid falling into consensus traps : 1 ) An appeal to the masses : \u201c Most Christians believe \u2026 \u201d .\n2 ) An appeal to experts : \u201c Most scholars say \u2026 \u201d .\nConsensus can be wrong .\nThere are numerous examples , in science and in other domains of knowledge , which demonstrate that majority opinion can be wrong .\nFor example , the belief that the sun revolved around the earth or that most ulcers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the H. pylori bacteria .\nSo , when we interpret Genesis 1\u201311 , we should judiciously consider the interpretation that has been given to the text for millennia by some of the greatest minds that have appeared since Solomon , Jesus , and Paul .\nTo properly interpret the Bible , we need to : \u2022 Trust the authority of the word of God .\n\u2022 Ask the Holy Spirit to guide us into the path of wisdom ( James 1:5 ) .\n\u2022 Remember that the Bible was not written for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sinners who need to know what to believe about God and what requirements he has for us ( Romans 15:4 ) .\n\u2022 Follow the example of Jesus , who used what was written to guide his thinking and actions ( Matthew 4:4 , 7 , 10 ) .\n\u2022 Refuse to allow our presuppositions to influence our interpretation of Scripture or to silence its voice .\n\u2022 Be humble before God \u2019 s word by accepting what it says and letting it correct our false notions .\n\u2022 Apply sensible biblical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those outlined above .\nIf we do this , we can trust that God the Holy

limbs provide on the broad surface of tree trunks . )\n4,5 But again it was the speed of adaptation , many thousands of times higher than ( their interpretation of ) the \u2018 fossil record \u2019 that surprised evolutionists.6 On small islands off British Columbia , the seeds of wind-dispersed weedy plants in the daisy family ( Asteraceae ) are rapidly losing their ability to \u2018 fly \u2019 .\nSpecifically , the embryo part of the seed is becoming fatter while the parachute-like \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is becoming smaller .\nThese changes are advantageous because they reduce dispersal\u2014otherwise , on such tiny islands , lightweight windblown seeds would be lost in the ocean ( which is why they have left fewer descendants ) .\nNote that these changes involve the loss of the capacity for long-range airborne dispersal.7 Other examples of rapid adaptation , even to the extent of producing \u2018 new species \u2019 \u2014speciation\u2014abound .\n( If a population arises from another which can not interbreed anymore with its parent population , it is generally defined as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported how evolutionists described as \u2018 alarming \u2019 the rate of change in the wingspan of European fruit flies introduced accidentally to America.8,9,10 Similarly , rapid changes have been reported recently for Drosophila fruit flies and sockeye salmon\u2014within just nine and thirteen generations respectively.11 In the case of Darwin \u2019 s famous finches , it had been estimated that from one million to five million years would have been necessary for today \u2019 s Galapagos Island species to radiate from their parent populations .\nBut actual observations of rapid finch adaptation have forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timeframe of just a few centuries.12 Not long ago , evolutionists were astonished to find that bird-biting mosquitoes , which moved into the London Underground train network ( and are now biting humans and rats instead ) , have already become a separate species.13 And now a study of house mice in Madeira ( thought to have been introduced to the island following 15th century Portuguese settlement ) has found that \u2018 several reproductively isolated chromosomal races \u2019 ( in effect , new \u2018 species \u2019 ) have appeared in less than 500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speedy changes have nothing to do with the production of any new genes by mutation ( the imagined mechanism of molecules-to-man evolution ) , but result mostly from selection of genes that already exist .\nHere we have real , observed evidence that ( downhill ) adaptive formation of new forms and species from the one created kind can take place rapidly .\nIt doesn \u2019 t need millions of years .\nShouldn \u2019 t evolutionists rejoice , and creationists despair , at all this observed change ?\nHardly .\nInformed creationists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily cause major variation in short time periods , by acting on the created genetic information already present .\nBut this does not support the idea of evolution in the molecules-to-man sense , because no new information has been added .\nSelection by itself gets rid of information , and of all observed mutations which have some effect on survival or function,15 so far even the rare \u2018 beneficial \u2019 ones are also losses of information .\nThe late-maturing , larger guppies resulted simply from a re-shuffling of existing genetic material.16 Such variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups from interbreeding with each other any more , thus forming new \u2018 species \u2019 by definition , without involving any new information .\nThe biblical account of history not only accommodates such rapid changes in body form , but actually requires that it would have happened much faster than evolutionists would expect .\nAs the animals left the Ark , multiplying to fill the Earth and all those empty ecological niches , natural selection could easily have caused an original \u2018 dog kind \u2019 ( e.g . )\non the Ark to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dingoes , etc .\nBecause there are historical records showing some of these subtypes in existence only a few hundred years after the Flood , this means that there had to have been some very rapid ( non-evolutionary ) speciation .\nSo it is encouragingly supportive of biblical history when some such rapid changes are seen still occurring today.17 And this is being repeatedly confirmed .\nBut since evolutionists mistakenly interpret all such adaptation/speciation as \u2018 evolution happening \u2019 , they are left stunned when it happens much faster than their traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n( This is , of course , easy to understand when it is realized that the standard idea about the fossil record\u2014that it is a \u2018 tape-recording \u2019 of millions of years\u2014is in fact a misinterpretation .\nThe record reflects the way in which a global Flood and some of its after-effects buried a world of plants and animals , in a time sequence which did not involve millions of years . )\nEven some evolutionists point out that evolution in the molecules-to-man sense was not observed in any of these studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolutionary ideas , the findings are often disputed , but with little success.2 Rapid \u2018 evolution \u2019 ( a misnomer , as we have seen ) is welcomed by some fossil experts who support the idea of \u2018 punctuated equilibrium \u2019 .18 This is the notion that the evolutionary history of life is one of mostly no change , \u2018 punctuated \u2019 by short , sharp bursts of evolution ( which , conveniently , happen too briefly to be recorded in the fossils ) .\nHowever , not only is this still a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of why , if fast change is everywhere , has not a vastly greater number of new species been generated over \u2018 geologic time \u2019 ?\nI.e .\nthe observed changes are still too fast for comfort .\nNot only is this rapid change not adding information , even some evolutionists point out that evolution in the molecules-to-man sense was not observed in any of these studies .\nThe finches are still finches , the mosquitoes stay mosquitoes , and the mice remain mice .\nOne evolutionary geneticist , referring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As far as I know , these are still guppies.\n\u2019 2 If we start with the Word of the One who knows all , the evidence of today \u2019 s world makes a great deal of sense .\nCreatures were to reproduce \u2018 after their kind \u2019 , so mice come from mice , lizards from lizards , daisies from daisies .\nEvolution has never occurred , nor does it occur today .\nBut organisms have a wonderful \u2018 built-in \u2019 genetic capacity for rapid change in response to environmental pressures\u2014most easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such examples of rapid adaptation give us an insight into how the Earth \u2019 s many vacant ecological niches were recolonized after the Flood\u2014a global event in real history .\nThis event buried the \u2018 world that then was \u2019 ( 2 Peter 3:6 ) .\nBecause this was already a fallen world , the fossils record death , suffering and disease .\nBecause it was a created world , the fossil record consists of the remains of

squid-like creature , sporting 10 tentacles , has been found in Montana , USA , and given the name Syllipsimopodi bideni .\nAmong the cephalods , it is more particularly called a vampyropod.1 Its discoverers claim it is ancestral to both octopuses and vampire squid .\nAn octopus has eight ( \u2018 octo \u2019 ) arms .\nSquid belong to the superorder Decapodiformes and have 10 ( \u2018 deca \u2019 ) arms ; compare the word \u2018 decade \u2019 .\nAll such creatures are mostly soft-bodied ; they don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new vampyropod does have a gladius ( or pen ) , a hard internal body part .\nAccording to Mike Vecchione , a Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History zoologist , \u201c It \u2019 s very rare to find soft tissue fossils , except in a few places \u201d .2 Yet , in the Mississippian ( Lower Carboniferous ) layer of Montana , they found this \u201c exceptionally well-preserved vampyropod \u201d with some evidence of a 2.6 cm long ink sac.3 To prevent soft tissues from decaying , special conditions have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from the elements and scavengers .\nCMI has written extensively about Noah \u2019 s Flood providing exactly such conditions ( and not just in a few places , but throughout the world ) .\nSlow and gradual processes prove to be very problematic for evolutionists attempting to explain excellent preservation .\nSquid just got a whole lot \u2018 older \u2019 Another issue with this fossil is that it \u2019 s \u2018 dated \u2019 to be 330 million years old , pushing back the previous \u2018 date \u2019 for the oldest creatures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThat approximately 33 % increase in geological \u2018 age \u2019 is because it was found in a deeper layer ( Mississippian ) than the previously deemed oldest vampyropod ( middle Triassic ) .\nIt means that , although vampyropods used to be seen as contemporary with early dinosaurs , they are now believed to have evolved much earlier than those \u2018 terrible lizards \u2019 .\nIn addition , the fossil and the artist \u2019 s impression look just like modern day squid ( see here and here ) \u2014there \u2019 s no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bideni was buried during the inundatory stage of Noah \u2019 s flood about 4,400 years ago.4 The conventional evolutionary narrative goes like this ( quoting from the new paper ) : \u201c ten sucker-bearing arms are preserved \u201d and this \u201c ten arm condition is ancestral for cephalopods and vampyropods \u201d ( some of which only have eight arms ) , therefore , its descendants \u201c have either reduced arm pair II to filaments [ \u2026 ] or lost the arm pair entirely.\n\u201d 3 Even if two arms/tentacles were lost , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to demonstrate , namely the innovation of specified complex structures .\nWhat the evolutionists do not discuss is the gradual addition of any of these arms , step-by-step , during the alleged millions of years that preceded the existence of this ancestral species , Syllipsimopodi bideni .\nThis is reminiscent of Darwin \u2019 s Origin of Species which discussed many species and variations in them , but not their origins .\nIn it he also said , \u201c If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight modifications , my theory would absolutely break down.\n\u201d 5 Here is another example where the

particularly the artist \u2019 s rendition , is readily recognised as a squid , with no sign of the significant changes one would expect over an alleged 330 million years of evolution .\nInstead , the stasis ( lack of change ) during that imagined vast time period , combined with the exquisite preservation , readily testify to a rapid burial of this creature during Noah \u2019 s Flood , about 4,400

"content": "A few years ago , some leading creationist geologists and physicists began a detailed research project into Radioactivity and the Age of The Earth ( RATE ) .\nThis RATE project began as a cooperative venture between the Institute for Creation Research ( ICR ) , the Creation Research Society of USA ( CRS ) and Creation Ministries International ( CMI ) .1 With the release of key peer-reviewed papers at the 2003 ICC ( International Conference on Creationism ) , it is clear that RATE has made some fantastic progress , with real breakthroughs in this area .\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandia National Laboratories ( he now works full-time for ICR ) , he and Dr John Baumgardner ( still with Los Alamos National Laboratory ) were both convinced that they knew the direction in which to look for a definitive answer to the puzzle of why radiometric dating consistently gives ages of millions and billions of years .\nOthers had tried to find an answer in geological processes\u2014e.g .\nthe pattern was caused by the way the magma was emplaced or how it crystallized .\nThis is indeed the answer in some cases.2,3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other cases there were many independent lines of evidence that suggested that huge amounts of radioactive decay had indeed taken place .\n( These include the variety of elements used in \u2018 standard \u2019 radioisotope dating , mature uranium radiohalos and fission track dating . )\nIt would be hard to imagine that geologic processes alone could explain all these .\nRather , there was likely to be an answer that concerned the nuclear decay processes themselves .\nFrom the eyewitness testimony of God \u2019 s Word , the billions of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would normally suggest had not taken place .\nSo it was clear that the assumption of a constant , slow decay process was wrong .\nThere must have been speeded-up decay , perhaps in a huge burst associated with Creation Week and/or a separate burst at the time of the Flood .\nThere is now powerful confirmatory evidence that at least one episode of drastically accelerated decay has indeed been the case , building on the work of Dr Robert Gentry on helium retention in zircons .\nThe landmark RATE paper,4 though technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 When uranium decays to lead , a by-product of this process is the formation of helium , a very light , inert gas , which readily escapes from rock .\n\u2022 Certain crystals called zircons , obtained from drilling into very deep granites , contain uranium which has partly decayed into lead .\n\u2022 By measuring the amount of uranium and \u2018 radiogenic lead \u2019 in these crystals , one can calculate that , if the decay rate has been constant , about 1.5 billion years must have passed .\n( This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 assigned to the granites in which these zircons are found . )\n\u2022 However , there is a significant proportion of helium from that \u2018 1.5 billion years of decay \u2019 still inside the zircons .\nThis is , at first glance , surprising for long-agers , because of the ease with which one would expect helium ( with its tiny , light , unreactive atoms ) to escape from the spaces within the crystal structure .\nThere should surely be hardly any left , because with such a slow buildup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not accumulating .\n\u2022 Drawing any conclusions from the above depends , of course , on actually measuring the rate at which helium leaks out of zircons .\nThis is what one of the RATE papers reports on .\nThe samples were sent ( without any hint that it was a creationist project ) to a world-class expert on helium diffusion from minerals to measure these rates .\nThe consistent answer : the helium does indeed seep out quickly over a wide range of temperatures .\nIn fact , the results show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zircons , these crystals ( and since this is Precambrian basement granite , by implication the whole earth ) could not be older than 14,000 years .\nIn other words , in only a few thousand years , 1.5 billion years \u2019 worth ( at today \u2019 s rates ) of radioactive decay has taken place .\nInterestingly , the data have since been refined and updated to give a date of 5,680 ( \u00b1 2,000 ) years .\nThe paper looks at the various avenues a long-ager might take by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there seems to be little hope for them unless they can show that the techniques used to obtain the results were seriously flawed .\nAnother dramatic breakthrough concerns radiocarbon .\nIt \u2019 s long been known that radiocarbon ( i.e .\ncarbon-14 , or 14C ) keeps popping up reliably in samples ( of coal , oil , gas , etc . )\nwhich are supposed to be \u2018 millions of years \u2019 old .\nHowever , with the short half-life of 14C it should decay to zero in only some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most.5 For instance , CMI has , over the years , commissioned and funded the radiocarbon testing of a number of wood samples from \u2018 old \u2019 sites ( e.g .\nsamples with Jurassic fossils , samples inside Triassic sandstone , and samples burnt by Tertiary basalt ) and these were published ( by then staff geologist Dr Andrew Snelling ) in Creation magazine and Journal of Creation .\nIn each case , with contamination eliminated , the result has been in the thousands of years , i.e .\n14C was present when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 .\nThese results encouraged the rest of the RATE team to investigate 14C further , building on the literature reviews of creationist physician Dr Paul Giem .\nIn another very important paper , scientists from the RATE group summarized the pertinent facts and presented further experimental data.6 The bottom line is that virtually all biological specimens , no matter how \u2018 old \u2019 they are supposed to be , show measurable 14C levels .\nThis effectively limits the age of all buried biota to less than ( at most ) 250,000 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the probability that before the Flood the ratio of radioactive to \u2018 normal \u2019 carbon was much lower,7 the calculated age comes right down into the biblical \u2018 ballpark \u2019 . )\nInterestingly , specimens which appear to definitely be pre-Flood seem to have 14C present , too , and importantly , these cluster around a lower relative amount of 14C .\nThis suggests that some 14C was primordial ( existing from the very beginning ) , and not produced by cosmic rays\u2014thus limiting the age of the entire earth to only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been somewhat spectacularly supported when Dr Baumgardner sent five diamonds to be analyzed for 14C .\nIt was the first time this had been attempted , and the answer came back positive\u201414C was present .\nThe diamonds , formed deep inside the earth , are assumed by evolutionists to be over a billion years old .\nNevertheless they contained radioactive carbon , even though , if the billion-year age were correct , they \u2018 shouldn \u2019 t have \u2019 .\nThis is exceptionally striking evidence , because a diamond has remarkably strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s the hardest substance known ) , so subsequent atmospheric or biological contamination should not find its way into the interior .\nThis is exceptionally striking evidence , because a diamond has remarkably strong lattice bonds ( that \u2019 s why it \u2019 s the hardest substance known ) , so subsequent atmospheric or biological contamination should not find its way into the interior .\nThe diamonds \u2019 carbon-dated \u2018 age \u2019 of about 58,000 years is thus an upper limit for the age of the whole earth .\nAgain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results reported above , which indicate the upper limit is in fact substantially less.8,9 14C workers have no real answer to this problem , namely that all the \u2018 vast-age \u2019 specimens they measure still have 14C .\nLabelling this detectable 14C with such words as \u2018 contamination \u2019 and \u2018 background \u2019 is completely unhelpful in explaining its source , as the RATE group \u2019 s careful analyses and discussions have shown .\nBut it is no problem or mystery at all if the uniformitarian/long-age assumptions are laid to one side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given in Scripture , is taken seriously .\nThe 14C is there , quite simply , because it hasn \u2019 t had time to decay yet .\nThe world just isn \u2019 t that old !\nThe 14C results are an independent but powerful confirmation of the stunning helium-diffusion results .\nIt looks like 2003 was a bad year for megachronophiles ( lovers of long ages ) , but a good year for lovers of the Word of God .", "author": "", "url": "https://creation.com/a/547", "published": "Wed, 26 Oct 2022 05:00:00 +1300", "published_utc": 1666774800, "collection_utc": 1666779278}, {"id":

what many called \u2018 The trip of a lifetime \u2019 In 2019 the idea to bring some of CMI \u2019 s ever-burgeoning research and perspectives about the history of ancient Egypt to life via a tour of Egypt , was born .\nI had the idea that maybe a handful of CMI supporters with an interest in this subject , might like to have guided tours of the sites accompanied by credentialed CMI staff members .\nWe got about building an itinerary , then a website , and sent out one email to our mailing list in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 or 30 people interested .\nAmazingly , within seven days , the tour was completely sold out ( 110 people ) .\nSo , our local tour company in Egypt suggested advertising a second tour .\nThey said , \u201c You \u2019 re here anyway , so why not add another ?\n\u201d But this sold out quickly as well , which led to a third tour being added .\nThey were due to commence in August 2020 .\nThen something called \u2018 Covid \u2019 interrupted our plans .\nEventually in August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world again , the first of three ten-day tours began .\nThey were respectively called The Khufu , Rameses and Seti tours .\nStarting in Cairo we visited the great pyramids of Khufu , Khafre and Menkaure on the Giza plateau with many of our guests opting for camel rides , which takes them past all three pyramids .\nOne can not get more Egyptian than riding a camel in front of one of the only remaining seven wonders of the ancient world !\nThis area included the Valley Temple and great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 the Dream Stele \u2019 of Thutmoses IV .\nWe told guests to pay particular attention to it , as it would later feature in presentations regarding the identity of the pharaoh of the Exodus .\nWhile in Cairo , we also visited Sakkara , where the first true pyramid was ever built , known as the Stepped Pyramid of Djoser , designed by architect , physician , priest and general polymath , Imhotep of the 3rd dynasty ( and no , he is not biblical Joseph ! )\nIt is now estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is arguably the most important archaeological site in all of Egypt .\nWhile there , we also went inside the pyramid of the 6th dynasty pharaoh , Unas .\nThe walls in his burial chamber were panelled in solid alabaster .\nThe hieroglyphics looked so precision-cut , one would think they had been carved by lasers .\nAnd they were painted in well-known \u2018 Egyptian blue \u2019 .\nOne of our CMI guides for the tour , Gavin Cox , obtained his Master \u2019 s degree in Egyptology on these specific tomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first time a pharaoh had his journey and trials to the blessed afterlife recorded in his tomb .\nIt was to become standard practice after him .\nThe Valley of the Kings and more After this we flew to Luxor ( ancient Thebes ) where we would see incredible temples and have the opportunity to enter tombs in the famous Valley of the Kings , including Tutankhamun \u2019 s .\nWe gazed upon the mummy of this minor boy king , who has arguably become the most famous name associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasures that were recovered from his tomb .\nYet his tomb was the smallest we visited .\nSome others were cut over 200 metres ( 650 feet ) into the valley \u2019 s hillsides and were sealed over .\nOne can not comprehend the wealth that some of these ancient kings were buried with if King Tut \u2019 s tomb discovery was anything to go by .\nBut alone , the artwork in these tombs was simply stunning and so well preserved considering it was all c.3,500 years old .\nOne of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip was the Nile cruise portion .\nThis ancient river has , for thousands of years , helped feed millions of people past and present .\nI suggested to many guests that they should imagine how this ancient highway was also used by the ancient Egyptians to transport the massive blocks and obelisks that we were visiting at the various sites and temples .\nSome of these blocks weighed hundreds of tons .\nAs we slowly made our way upstream , it seemed like life had not changed in thousands of years either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and irrigation practices still employed .\nWe also cruised past ancient sandstone quarries that were used to harvest some of the aforementioned blocks .\nBut , in my opinion , one of the greatest ancient monuments in the world is the temple of Rameses II at Abu Simbel .\nThis was around a four hour drive from Aswan ( the last destination of our cruise ) that also provided the great experience of driving across the Sahara and seeing and recognizing so many natural features that the Egyptians styled their monuments on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that an original pyramidion ( the very top of the pyramid ) shaped stone , called a benben ( bn-bn ) arose out of the creation floodwaters or Nu ( possibly a reference to Noah being the god of these floodwaters ) .\nIn their mythology , their creator god Atum ( possibly linguistically linked to Adam ) settled upon this rock and started his family .\nThis pyramid/benben shape is also prominent in many mounds found naturally around the landscape .\nThey are often rocky and are possibly remnants from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the environment of Egypt was much wetter and erosion occurred much faster .\nOf course , they have subsequently been carved by the winds and sands that ravage the deserts .\nMany think , like me , that they are the most likely source for the inspiration of the benben myth and the pyramids themselves .\nMost of the monuments that the ancient Egyptians built are representations of the natural world ( as are most of their gods ) , so this would make sense .\nIt was the first event in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporters from all of our seven offices worldwide , and others , in attendance .\nIn all , ten countries were represented .\nIt is genuinely hard to convey just how much our supporters seemed to appreciate this trip .\nIt was not just great fun where we all learned so much , but many commented that it was a spiritual experience for them also .\nHere are some comments that were anonymously written on the feedback forms we handed out at the end of each trip : This trip was a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a combination of many things , some personal .\nWhat I do know is that the \u201c before Egypt trip me \u201d is not the same as the \u201c after Egypt trip me \u201d .\nI felt like I lived , grew ( socially , spiritually , physically , mentally ) and experienced more in those 10 days than the past 5 years .\nI want to thank CMI for allowing us to experience this amazing journey with amazing people .\nOur ship for the

orientation of their stars .\nThis was first referred to by Spencer in 20101 for the case of an exoplanet known as WASP-17b ( The acronym \u2018 WASP \u2019 represents a British project called the \u2018 Wide Area Search for Planets \u2019 ) .\nIn theories of the formation of planets , the star first forms in a flattened disk of gas and dust .\nThe planets then form from the gas and dust in the spinning disk .\nSince the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get their motion from the spinning disk , the planet orbits would normally be expected to be lined up close to the equator of the star .\nBut in some cases exoplanets have been discovered in which the orbit inclinations are very different from the plane of the equator of the star .\nThis raises questions about how these exoplanetary systems came into this configuration .\nThese cases have been challenging for planetary scientists to explain .\nIn our own solar system , this angle between the solar equator and the ecliptic plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In mid-April of 2010 , a conference was held at the University of Glasgow for astronomers .\nThis event was the National Astronomy Meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society ( RAS ) .\nAt this meeting it was announced that scientists had discovered that in a group of 27 exoplanet cases studied , six of these planets seemed to be moving retrograde in comparison to the spin axis of their star .\nThis was quite a surprise.2 At the conference , the report on the six retrograde exoplanets was presented by Andrew Cameron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new results really challenge the conventional wisdom that planets should always orbit in the same direction as their stars spin.\n\u201d 2 Since 2010 there has been more research on similar cases , and scientists are attempting to refine their methods for investigating these stars and their exoplanet orbits .\nToday these exoplanets are referred to by scientists as \u2018 misaligned \u2019 when the plane of the exoplanet \u2019 s orbit is significantly different from the equator of the star .\nThere are many factors that complicate observations of the inclined exoplanets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be combined in order to properly determine the properties of the star .\nOnce the star \u2019 s spin axis can be determined with some confidence , then it may be possible to determine the angle between the stellar spin axis and the exoplanet orbit .\nSome key techniques involved in these determinations are asteroseismology , spectroscopy measurements of the transit light curve , and what is known as the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect ( figure 1 ) .\nThe first requirement in determining the inclination of the exoplanet orbit is that the planet must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sight .\n( In a transit , the exoplanet passes in front of the star . )\nThe transiting planet causes a dip in the light curve from the star .\nAsteroseismology is then used to analyze oscillatory modes of the star to determine a number of stellar properties , including its spin axis.3 The Rossiter-McLaughlin effect affects Doppler measurements of redshift during a transit .\nDue to the star \u2019 s rotation , one side of the stellar disk moves toward the observer ( and is blueshifted ) while the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the observer ( redshifted ) .\nAs the planet passes in front of the stellar disk , it blocks part of the blueshifted light and then blocks part of the redshifted light ( figure 1 ) .\nThis produces a measurable effect in the redshift at the edges of the star.4,5 This causes the redshift to be skewed in a manner that depends on the angle between the orbit of the planet and the spin axis of the star .\nThe actual geometry is complicated because in doing an observation , the observer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spin axis and a projection of the exoplanet \u2019 s orbital plane .\nThus , the variations in the star and the Doppler transit data are examined over a period of time and a model of the motion of the star and the planet is constructed to explain the variations in the light curve .\nThere are two angles used in reference to these cases , one is denoted by the Greek letter \u03bb ( lambda ) , which is the projection of the spin-orbit angle on the plane of the sky .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual angle desired is in a different plane .\nSo , the goal is to determine in three dimensions the angle between the stellar spin axis and the planet \u2019 s orbital axis , denoted by \u03c8 ( psi ) .3 The angle \u03c8 is known as the stellar obliquity .\nOnly some transiting exoplanets have been sufficiently studied to determine both of these angles .\nThe results can vary from different research teams measuring the two angles .\nIn 2017 Spencer listed 20 cases of inclined exoplanet orbits for 16 stars.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranged from 0 to 145\u00b0 .\n( Note that an angle \u03c8 greater than 90\u00b0 is considered retrograde , although exoplanet cases close to 90\u00b0 are often described as being in \u2018 polar orbits \u2019 . )\nIt is instructive to consider how much variation in the \u03bb and \u03c8 angles there can be from different observations and different analyses .\nA concern might be raised over whether the conclusions correctly follow from the observations .\nCan the high angles for \u03bb and \u03c8 be reproduced ?\nTo show an example we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one of the most studied cases of exoplanets and thus multiple teams have done observations and analyses .\nTable 1 shows four sets of values for the \u03bb and \u03c8 angles , along with the amount of possible error or uncertainty estimated by the various researchers .\nIn table 1 , each name under the \u2018 Source \u2019 column represents a team of researchers with a published source .\nThe Winn7 and Narita8 sources , as well as Albrecht5 all did their own original observations of the HAT-P-7 star .\nLater , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-analyzed the data .\nNote that the uncertainties in both angles is significant and is estimated very differently by different researchers .\nYet , in spite of this , the final results for angle psi are similar , with the angle estimated to be from 94.6\u00b0 to 116.4\u00b0 .\nThus , this planet is in a roughly polar orbit around its star .\nThis conclusion is certainly borne out by multiple researchers .\nIn the accepted origins scenarios for the formation of stars , disks , and planetary systems , this raises interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Creator could create an exoplanet with any orbit inclination about its star .\nBut from a naturalistic or evolutionary perspective , it requires scientists to put forward creative scenarios .\nOne common approach is to propose that a planet near the star , as it migrated in , would have its orbit altered over long periods of time by another planet ( or possibly a second star ) in a more distant but inclined orbit .\nThis is sometimes referred to as the Kozai effect.11,12 The Kozai mechanism relies on there being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are in differing planes that can perturb each other over time .\nA planet migrating inward can be influenced by tidal effects from the star as well .\nNear passes between planets can also cause an orbit inclination to change .\nPlanet\u2013planet scattering scenarios like this tend to require billions of years of time .\nPlanet\u2013planet scattering scenarios also require that there be a third object ( a planet or star ) in certain types of inclined elliptical orbits .\nIn many systems there is no observational evidence of such a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward that try to provide a mechanism for the star and the disk around it to be misaligned early during the formation of the star .\nOne approach to this suggests the magnetic field of the star can tilt the star relative to the disk.13 Another proposal is that in some systems if gas and dust falling onto a forming star falls inward with a non-symmetrical configuration it can cause the resulting star to have a different orientation than the resulting disk.13 Another view suggests that the star formed in a cluster of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stars near each other distorts , truncates , and tilts the disk before the planets form.14 Then the planet ( or planets ) form from what remains of the disk .\nThese types of scenarios might be described as \u2018 early tilt \u2019 mechanisms .\nIn these \u2018 early tilt \u2019 scenarios there is less reliance on exoplanet orbit migration .\nInstead , the orientation of the star compared to the disk is determined early while the star is young and then the planets form later .\nA potential problem with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be disrupted by the processes and so there may not be enough material left to form planets .\nAlso , all of these early-tilt scenarios depend on complex theories of star formation which are totally theoretical and not verifiable by observations .\nA number of researchers have noticed another curious correlation between the effective temperature of the star and its obliquity angle \u03c8 .\nIt seems that hotter stars tend to have more highly tilted orbits for their exoplanets .\nMore research is needed on potential causes of this correlation .\nSome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early tilt \u2019 star formation scenarios above.15 However , Winn16 and Albrecht5 have suggested it could be a tidal dissipation effect relating to the interaction of the star and the planet .\nAs the planet migrates inward toward the star tidal forces become stronger .\nIt is thought that a hot star is more likely to change the tilt of a planet orbit but a cooler star may come into alignment with the planet orbit .\nThe exoplanets with misaligned orbits will continue to motivate much research by planetary scientists .\nThe critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy exercise in science .\nHow many exoplanets have these \u2018 misaligned \u2019 orbits ?\nThere are various estimates , but it may be that approximately 40 % of transiting exoplanets which have been studied using the RM measurements could be considered misaligned .\nOut of this 40 % , only a few are likely to be actual retrograde cases .\nBenomar et al.9 summarize the problem : That there are highly inclined exoplanet orbits ( relative to their stellar equators ) is not disputed today among planetary scientists .\nThis finding has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to new theories to attempt to explain these cases .\nThe diversity of exoplanets points to God \u2019 s creativity and power .\nThough Scripture does not mention planets in Genesis Chapter 1 , it seems logical to put the supernatural creation of planets along with the creation of stars on the fourth day of the Creation Week .\nWithout acknowledging supernatural creation , scientists are forced to propose very complex scenarios to explain exoplanet diversity .\nThe variety of planetary systems God created continues to surprise and challenge scientists .\nSupernatural creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viable explanation .", "author": "", "url": "https://creation.com/a/16043", "published": "Fri,

are doing great work , may God reward you for all you do .\nBut your articles on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older articles ( by David Down ) , you placed the exodus in the 12th dynasty , now you say it was the 18th dynasty .\nWhy ?\nAnd who is the pharao of the exodus then ?\nI have also been asked about the naqada culture which secularists date to 4500 .\nWe know this date can not be accepted , but where would you place the naqada culture in a biblical timeline ?\nBefore the first dynasty or simultaneously ( if it even existed ) ?\nFrom what I have understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vizier under the Hyksos .\nYour argument is that an Egyptian Pharao would never allow a foreigner in this position .\nI disagree with you here .\nThis is how a secularist scientist would argue , but not a christian .\nWe know that God used pagan rulers many times in the bible to accomplish His purpose .\nIf God wants Joseph to be a vizier under a native Egyptian Pharao , then His will be done .\nWith men it is impossible , but with God all things are possible ( Matthew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read that the Hyksos never ruled over all of Egypt , but Joseph was set over ALL the land of Egypt ( Genesis 41 : 41 ) .\nSince the Hyksos were foreigners , why would they make another foreigner as second in command ?\nAnd even if you hold to a short sejourn ( 215 yrs ) , the datings don \u2019 t match .\nThe exodus

came , \u201c a new king , who had not known Joseph , came to power in Egypt \u201d ( Exodus 1 , 8 ) .\nPerhaps this is a better solution .\nI hope you will consider my remarks .\nThanks , Eva , for your comments and criticisms , which we will endeavour to answer !\nRegarding Egyptian chronology on CMI \u2019 s site , yes , as you notice , we have moved away from the positions laid out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some by Patrick Clark ) .\nWe will be putting a notice at the top of many of them to say that CMI no longer accepts the chronological positions laid out by the authors , and why .\nYes , we now place the Exodus in the mid-late 18th Dynasty , for multiple reasons .\nThus , we have been prepared to move away from certain held positions in the light of new evidence , rather than hold onto ideas that are no longer tenable .\nWe suggest you do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our later chronology articles to get up to speed and as to why there is much confusion on the subject .\nFor instance : see Gary Bates \u2019 s Did the Exodus lead to the Hyksos Invasion ?\nAnd especially : Egyptian chronology and the Bible\u2014framing the issues .\nAlso , one has to be careful approaching this subject from a distance .\nYou say you disagree but on what basis ?\nIf you talk to any Egyptologist and not just a lay dabbler on the topic ; when one understands ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their world and their own \u2018 blessed \u2019 land and the gods of nature that oversaw their land , it is actually completely unthinkable that they would give any land away to foreigners .\nWhile some lands were subjugated by foreigners , and apart from your wishful thinking on the subject , there is not a single occasion where this is recorded in any Egyptian texts .\nRegarding the Naqada culture , such ancient dating will be based on carbon 14 , which is more unreliable the further one goes back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Flood .\nTake a look at this article by Dr Robert Carter on the subject : How carbon dating works .\nRegarding where we would place the Naqada culture is difficult to say , but probably around the time of Babel , some 2,100 years , which is probably a pre-Dynastic date , but certainly not pre-Flood as the secular date suggests .\nYes , CMI believes that Joseph ( a non-Egyptian ) could only have come to prominence under a non-Egyptian pharaoh .\nNative Egyptians would never promote a foreigner to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is how a secularist scientist would argue , but not a christian [ sic ] .\n\u201d Please don \u2019 t assume to take the spiritual high ground with CMI , you need to read what we have written before taking that tone please .\nCMI doesn \u2019 t argue like secular/ non-Christian thinkers .\nWe start with Scripture !\nThe idea that Joseph spoke to a Hyksos pharaoh , not an Egyptian pharaoh , is not just our idea .\nIt is indicated by Scripture itself , because it makes perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Joseph , his brothers , and the pharaoh at Genesis 46:31\u201334 ; 47:1\u20136 ( please take time to read these passages as the context will be clear ) .\nThe biblical narrator is basically telling his readers that the pharaoh that Joseph was speaking to was a non-Egyptian pharaoh !\nOnly a Hyksos ( Semitic ) pharaoh would give the \u201c best of the land \u201d to shepherds !\nPharaoh didn \u2019 t \u2018 bat an eyelid \u2019 when Joseph \u2019 s brothers told him they were shepherds , which were an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not to Joseph \u2019 s pharaoh , because he wasn \u2019 t an Egyptian !\nJoseph specifically told them to say this so they would find favour with the pharaoh who obviously did not like Egyptians !\nAnd later , the non-Egyptian pharaoh puts Joseph \u2019 s family in charge of his flocks .\nBut hang on , flocks and sheepherders were an abomination ?\nThis is what Scripture is clearly telling us .\nSo , you are arguing against this clear position .\nYou state : \u201c If God wants Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egyptian Pharao [ sic ] , then His will be done.\n\u201d As with the creation/evolution debate , it \u2019 s never about what God could have done or might have done , but what He said He did .\nYours is an argument from silence and your reasoning is entirely circular .\nThis is not proof that the pharoah was Egyptian , and it appears that you might be stuck on an old idea that you are simply not willing to relinquish !\nAnyway , wouldn \u2019 t that same logic answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruling all Egypt , Joseph was given responsibility over all Egypt ?\nCan God not do anything ?\nHowever , we won \u2019 t use your line of argument !\nFirstly , remember the phrase \u201c all the land of Egypt \u201d comes from the lips of the pharaoh , thus , the Bible is simply reporting what was said .\nIt is not making a theological statement about which parts were ruled and when .\nSo , a Hyksos ruler would consider the territory he ruled as the \u201c land of Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t take that line of reasoning , the Bible still states : \u201c And every nation came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain , because the famine was severe over all the earth \u201d ( Genesis 41:57 ) .\nThis would also include native-Egyptian territory that the Hyksos didn \u2019 t rule at that time ( Upper Egypt ) .\nSo , we consider your line of reasoning entirely redundant .\nBut actually , the Hyksos did rule over most of Egypt in the sense they had economic control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The native Egyptians were relegated to Thebes ( modern day Luxor ) and were paying taxes to the Hyksos pharaoh .\nThe last ( Egyptian ) pharaoh of the 17th dynasty\u2014a period when the Hyksos ruled\u2014 ( Kamose ) wrote : You ask \u201c Since the Hyksos were foreigners , why would they make another foreigner as second in command ?\n\u201d But Joseph wasn \u2019 t a foreigner to the Hyksos , he was a fellow Semite , which is the entire point of the argument !\nAnd they were believers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another clue is that the Hyksos pharaoh lauded Joseph and his God for interpreting pharaoh \u2019 s dream .\nThis is another unthinkable thing for an Egyptian to do .\nThey believed in the many gods of nature and pharaoh \u2019 s job was to maintain \u2018 balance \u2019 or Maat between the land and the gods .\nBy lauding a single god , pharaoh would have been undermining the whole religious , economic and political system that were completely intertwined .\nIn other words , the very structure upon which his position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And even if you hold to a short sojourn ( sic ) ( 215 yrs ) , the datings don \u2019 t match.\n\u201d Actually , the short sojourn fits perfectly with Joseph encountering a Semite pharaoh and the Exodus taking place 215 years later in 1,446 .\nCMI holds to a short Sojourn of 215 years for good reasons .\nIf you hold to a long Sojourn , you need to see this article A response to a long Sojourn advocate .\nYou also state : \u201c The exodus in 1446+215 makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what ?\nYou then state : \u201c But the Hyksos are said to have been in Egypt ca .\n1640/1630\u20131530 .\nSo they came after Israel was in Egypt.\n\u201d We beg to differ with you here , and disagree with your dates !\nWe will quote Gary Bates to answer your objection ( see end of long Sojourn article ) : Additionally , in the article you commented on , Gavin wrote supporting Gary \u2019 s research that chariots were not found in Egypt prior to the Hyksos bringing them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the second chariot over Egypt ( Genesis 41:43 .\nYou might think this is a trite point but it is a hugely significant one as to the timing of Joseph \u2019 s elevation to vizier .\nYour 1661 date falls neatly near the beginning of the 2IP ( c.1677\u20131550 ) between the end of the Middle Kingdom and the start of the New Kingdom .\nHistory tells us that the 12th Dynasty Queen Sobekneferu ( 1806\u20131802 ) died with no heirs , which was a serious thing in Egypt , leaving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to a sudden end .\nThe 13th Dynasty was marked by the accession of king with a Semitic name\u2013King Khendjer .\nHe was unable to rule the entire territory of Egypt , with native-Egyptian rule centralising in the south .\nThere then followed five rulers that are commonly identified as being of Canaanite ( Semitic ) descent based on their names .\nIt would have been one of those Semitic pharaohs that would have ruled at the time of Joseph .\nWe don \u2019 t have enough historical data to pin down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been , as yet .\nRegarding whether the dates \u2018 match \u2019 for the Hyksos , 1661 matches very well .\nBut you give no evidence as to why you believe the pharaoh under Joseph was a native Egyptian ?\nWe have given biblical evidence as to why we believe this pharaoh definitely wasn \u2019 t Egyptian .\nTherefore , the native Egyptians who succeeded the Semitic Hyksos in the 18th Dynasty were the ones who \u201c did not know Joseph \u201d , because they were not Semitic , and they treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo CMI \u2019 s solution is the better solution .\nMost of what we have written is actually covered in our Tour Egypt booklet .\nIt is available as an eBook also .\nIf you are genuinely interested in the topic , we recommend reading more about this as our reasonings will be more fully explained .\nWe hope you consider our remarks , Gavin Cox and Gary Bates .", "author": "", "url": "https://creation.com/a/16129", "published": "Sat, 29 Oct 2022 05:00:00 +1300", "published_utc": 1667034000, "collection_utc": 1667038430}, {"id":

over the doctrine of heaven and the future new heavens and earth .\nMany Christians , while they look forward to being with Jesus after our physical death here on earth , do not have a real idea of what our eternal existence will \u2018 look like \u2019 or entail .\nOften , they read about the new heavens and earth described in Revelation 21\u201322 and then imagine existing forever in some sort of ethereal realm , instead of eternal existence in a real , restored , physical universe .\nHowever , the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we have to look forward to , and understanding our future state also helps us to understand what we lost when Adam fell .\nThis also has serious implications for those who want to allegorize the Creation events in Genesis in order to add millions of years of evolutionary history .\nIn 1 Corinthians 15 , Paul takes a bold stance on the Resurrection : Paul is saying that we must believe in the physical resurrection of Christ to be saved\u2014it \u2019 s that important .\nThis is because our future resurrection\u2014what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resurrection as Jesus \u2019 .\nSo the resurrection of the dead is a Gospel issue ; you can \u2019 t be a Christian and not believe that we ( believers ) will live forever with Christ\u2014in real , physical , resurrected bodies .\nBut where will those bodies live ?\nScripture \u2019 s testimony is clear and unanimous that the new heavens and earth ( hereafter NHE ) will be a physical ( yet also spiritual ) realm .\nBefore we go on we would like to point out that , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( eschatology ) to discuss the issue , we are not taking some denominational or eschatological position that falls outside of our ministry \u2019 s mandate of dealing with origins ( our reasons are explained in End-times and Early-times ) .\nAs we shall see , a fully restored creation ( as outlined in the book of Revelation and elsewhere in Scripture ) is unequivocally linked to the events in the Garden of Eden and is part of all mainstream eschatological views .\nThe doctrine of a NHE has been a standard core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mainstream ( non-cultic ) denominations throughout all of Christian history .\nThe Bible teaches that this present earth ( indeed all of creation ; cf .\nRom 8:22 ) is cursed because of the presence of sin and will be destroyed .\nPeter writes : Note that Peter is not using figures of speech .\nIndeed , just before this , he reminds his readers that God had previously judged the whole globe with a cataclysmic flood in history .\nHe does not say , \u201c It will be as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn straightforward language , he is saying that God is actually going to burn up the universe and set up a \u201c new heavens and earth in which righteousness dwells \u201d .\nAnd he uses this fact to tell his audience to live a life befitting citizens of the new heavens and earth .\nIt is not a hyperbole to call them an \u201c uncreation \u201d of the heavens and earth\u2014many judgments in the Bible are reversals of creation ; for example , the Flood reversed creation to the time before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day 2 , and Jeremiah 4:23 alludes to a future uncreation that reverses the universe back to the state described in Genesis 1:2 .\nAgain , depending on one \u2019 s eschatological stance , many of the various judgments in Revelation ( e.g .\none third of mankind killed [ 9:15 ] ) may be presented either with some symbolic meaning or a more literal meaning , but this distracts from the main point of this article\u2014what happens at the end .\nIt is not our point to discuss the details , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is that the present Creation will suffer terrible , utterly destructive judgment because of sin .\nBut the destruction is not the end of the story , because God will create a new heaven and a new earth \u201c for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away \u201d ( Revelation 21:1 ) and believers will live in that new creation for eternity .\nWhy will this world be destroyed ?\nTo destroy a whole universe seems a rather drastic solution to the problem of a fallen world .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole creation fell .\nRomans 8:19\u201323 says : When Adam sinned , the earth was cursed because of him ( Genesis 3:17\u201319 ) , and the earth was further polluted by murder , violence , and immorality ( 6:11\u201312 ; Leviticus 18:24\u201328 ; Numbers 35:33 ; Psalm 106:38 ; Jeremiah 3:2 , 9 ; 16:18 ) .\nBut it is not just the dirt on the surface of the earth ; it is the entire universe , all of creation ( Greek ktisis ) , that is cursed .\nThus , all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because the creation has been affected by the Curse and further polluted by man \u2019 s sin , it is not a suitable place for resurrected , perfect people to live .\nHow could we live among fossils , graveyards and reminders of death ( even if their inhabitants were vacated ) , and a Flood-scarred earth that bore testimony to God \u2019 s great judgment of sin ?\nHow can we live forever next to a star that has a limited lifespan or in a universe with built-in , non-eternal features that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ?\nAll of this is a reminder that death is an enemy that beset all of Creation , and a reminder that Christ has conquered death , thus , giving us something to look forward to : Just as our bodies die , and return to dust , they will be raised as new bodies that nevertheless have continuity with our former selves , likewise the earth is fallen and will be destroyed , but it will be destroyed in order to be renewed .\nThe restoration of the earth is directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Christ .\nJust as we have to die before we are resurrected , the earth must be destroyed before it is renewed .\nIt is not an \u2018 ultimate \u2019 or final destruction ; it is a destruction that clears the way for its re-creation .\nThe new world we look forward to Genesis uses the phrase \u201c heavens and earth \u201d to encompass all of the physical creation ( the universe ) .\nWhen the Bible ( 2 Peter 3:13 , Revelation 21\u201322 ) uses the phrase \u201c new heavens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarly all-encompassing meaning .\nIt is an indication of the continuity of the new creation with the old .\nBut the word \u2018 new \u2019 has the connotation of \u201c superior \u201d or \u201c improved \u201d , such that the old will be obsolete.1 We are given several images of the new world .\nIf we want to see what an unfallen physical creation looks like , the obvious place to start is Eden .\nEden is a picture of God \u2019 s ideal paradise on earth .\nIt was a place especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage in easy , pleasant work ( Genesis 2:15 ) and for the purposes of appreciating their Creator .\nAll Adam and Eve \u2019 s needs were provided for , and they were in regular , direct fellowship with God .\nThere was no sin , no death , and no barrier to mankind \u2019 s relationship with God .\nIn the NHE there is a return to a sinless state with no suffering or evil of any kind , and unlimited access to God ( Revelation 21:3\u20134 ) .\nAll of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice in paying for our sins .\nBut it is even better than the original creation , because it is not a simple return to Eden .\nRather , God will redeem the best parts of culture as well as the earth .\nThe best advance in the new heavens and earth will be that there will never be any possibility for sin or another Fall .\n\u201c Since \u2018 the wages of sin is death \u2019 ( Romans 6:23 ) , the promise of no more death is a promise a promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never die can never sin , since death is a punishment for sin .\nSin results in mourning , crying , and pain .\nIf those will never occur again , then sin can never occur again.\n\u201d 2 Will the new earth be physical ?\nAs we mentioned earlier , some people think our eternal destination is an ethereal place populated by disembodied spirits .\nBut that makes the mistake of confusing two places : the place where believers who die await the resurrection ( variously called Paradise or Heaven ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the consummation of all things eschatological .\nOn this Paul wrote : The Bible is clear that , although believers who die are \u201c at home with the Lord \u201d , they still await the resurrection of the dead , when our bodies will be transformed to be like Jesus \u2019 .\nAgain Paul says : We will also be morally perfected at that time so we will never sin .\nThe NHE will be as physical as the current heavens and earth .\nJust as the place where perfect people will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also can not be ethereal and non-physical .\nWe will need a physical , material world to live in then just as much as we do now .\nAnd the Bible \u2019 s descriptions of this world include re-created animals and trees , cities , streets , rivers , and other physical things .\nConversely , the new earth is never described in \u2018 ethereal \u2019 or ghostly terms .\nWhat about the \u2018 spiritual body \u2019 ?\nIn 1 Corinthians 15:44 , Paul says , \u201c It is sown a natural body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Some people take this to mean that when we are raised , we will be some sort of ethereal being .\nThis interpretation misunderstands what Paul means when he calls our earthly bodies \u201c natural \u201d and our resurrection bodies \u201c spiritual \u201d ( see Christ as the Last Adam ) .\nIt doesn \u2019 t refer to the \u2018 stuff \u2019 the body is made of , but of what motivates us and drives our desires .\nE.g .\nPaul previously referred to a \u2018 spiritual \u2019 person , using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obviously a physical person ( 1 Corinthians 2:15 ) .\nLet \u2019 s remember that even in our sinful physical bodies we are still spiritual beings .\nEven the Lord Jesus was referred to as a \u2018 life-giving \u201d or \u201c quickening spirit \u201d .\nThe point being made that one can be physical and spiritual at the same time .\nAnd in the same way , the NHE will be both a physical and spiritual place .\nThe spirit is not the sum of our being but part of it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of Adam from the dust of the ground , then breathed on him and this man became \u2018 a living creature \u2019 or \u2018 living soul \u2019 ( Hebrew nephesh chayyah , Genesis 2:7 ) .\nCurrently , even at our best we \u2019 re sinful , even though we \u2019 re forgiven sinners .\nIn the resurrection , our desires will be perfectly aligned with God \u2019 s will .\nNot only will we not be able to sin , we won \u2019 t want to sin .\nIt will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NHE will be made of matter , then it will take up space .\nAnd we know that space ( size ) and time are connected and related to each other .\nIt is a common belief that eternal life will be timeless , but that is not really correct .\nTime , as we understand it , began with the creation of the physical universe .\nAnd the timeframe used in the Bible is the earth \u2019 s .\nWhen the earth rotates with a light source on it , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is outside of time , because He preceded what He created\u2014only that which has no beginning in time can ever be outside of time .\nEvery created being experiences and will always experience life as a continuous series of events , one moment after another .\nWhen we sing a hymn in heaven , we will sing one word after another in time and we will need to count the bars of the song over time .\nIf we go from one place to another , it will take us time to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time will be measured , but it will certainly be experienced in some form .\nOne important theological reason that the new earth has to be physical is simply : if God does not redeem or restore the physical world , then Satan wins , because he would have foiled God \u2019 s original purpose in creating .\nWe \u2019 re told that God will undo everything Satan did , and He will make creation even better than before .\nBy the end of Revelation , sin is gone .\nIn addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grace , and Jesus is glorified as the Saviour of the nations .\nHumans are resurrected .\nWe \u2019 re not just sinless in the Resurrection ; we \u2019 re positively righteous and can never fall again .\nThe earth must similarly be restored , or there is a huge gap in how we perceive God \u2019 s redemptive work .\nWhen one reads of the restored creation and the New Heavens and Earth , particularly in chapters 21 and 22 of Revelation , it is absolutely clear that this is analogous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 .\nThey are inexorably intertwined .\nHe is sovereign and finally has His way and we can only marvel at His plan\u2014even though He knew of Satan \u2019 s plans in advance .\nThose who believe that God somehow used a process of millions of years of evolution have a huge inconsistency problem here .\nPresumably they have no problem with what is often called the \u2018 Blessed Hope \u2019 \u2014this future eternal paradise where all believers will live forever in a restored universe , recreated miraculously and instantaneously by God .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , then how could God have used a process of death and suffering to create the original ?\nSimply , is God going to restore things back to millions of years of death and suffering ?\nMoreover , if in the NHE we can see stars billions of light years away , do we then think that God \u2018 recreated \u2019 and stretched out space over billions of years again ( according to an old-Earth view of Genesis ) .\nOf course , that makes no sense .\nOne option would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as is done with Genesis 1 , but one then has to wonder why bother being saved because one can not be sure of the future state or have any real hope of what there is to look forward to .\nIn short , if God \u2019 s original design involved millions of years of death and suffering , then what is wrong with this creation ?\nWhy destroy it and create a new one ?\nThe NHE doctrine only makes sense within a creation/fall/restoration framework .\nIf God created a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes sense that God will restore it to a perfect world with no sin or death .\nBut every old-earth or evolutionary view puts death before Adam was created .\nThis does not come from Scripture but from deference to a philosophical assumption called naturalism ( the belief that natural processes can explain everything that has ever happened in the history of the universe ) .\nSo to some extent , it makes death part of God \u2019 s originally \u2018 very good \u2019 creation ( cf .\nGenesis 1:31 ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ s intended creation looks like\u2014but in the view of the compromisers , why didn \u2019 t He simply create it that way to begin with ?\nThe NHE is a powerful testimony to the original very good creation .\nPaul tells us , \u201c \u2018 What no eye has seen , nor ear heard , nor the heart of man imagined , what God has prepared for those who love him \u2019 \u2014these things has God revealed to us through the Spirit \u201d ( 1 Corinthians 2:9\u201310a ) .\nThe Bible tells us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to when we trust in Jesus\u2014eternal life in a perfect resurrection body , in a physical restored body , in perfect sinless fellowship with God .", "author": "", "url": "https://creation.com/a/9494", "published": "Tue, 01 Nov 2022 05:00:00 +1300", "published_utc": 1667293200,

the son of David , \u2026 \u2018 There is nothing new under the sun.\n\u2019 \u201d ( Ecclesiastes 1:1 , 9 ) .\nWe are reminded of this when atheists iterate and reiterate tired old discredited arguments that show gross ignorance of history .\nA common atheopathic claim goes somewhat as follows : For example , famous physicist Stephen Hawking ( 1942\u20132018 ) told the BBC : More recently , in the reboot of the famous Cosmos series , the atheistic presenter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c A mere four centuries ago , our tiny world was oblivious to the rest of the cosmos .\n\u2026 Back in 1599 , everyone knew that the Sun , planets and stars were just lights in the sky that revolved around the Earth , and that we were the center of a little universe , a universe made for us.\n\u201d 2 Vastness of space : very old news !\nHowever , such claims can be made only with an ignorance of history ( and the Bible ) .\nNot just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the leading theologians were well aware that compared to the vastness of the heavens , the earth was but a point in space .\nThey were familiar with the standard astronomy textbook of the Middle Ages ( 5th\u201315th century ) , the Almagest by Claudius Ptolemy ( c. 90\u2013c .\n168 ) : This secular knowledge was well known in the church .\nThe Roman Christian philosopher Bo\u00ebthius ( c. 480\u2013524/525 ) , in prison awaiting trial and execution for an unjust charge of treason , wrote The Consolation of Philosophy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Philosophy \u2019 .\nShe points out that just as the earth is only a point in space , how much more insignificant is any glory of any of its inhabitants : This was one of the most widely read and influential books in the West during most of the Middle Ages .\nSo churchmen were well aware of how tiny the earth is , without considering it the slightest threat to faith .\nLater in the middle ages , John Sacrobosco ( c.1195\u2013c.1256 ) wrote his Tractatus de Sphaera ( Treatise on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sphere was a hugely influential astronomy textbook that all medieval university students were required to study\u2014including theological students !\nBut somehow , antitheists for the last century or so have claimed that the immensity of the universe is news , and is a profound disproof of God .\nSeveral generations ago , C.S .\nLewis ( 1898\u20131963 ) liked to point out that the huge size of the universe often \u201c \u2026impresses people all the more because it is supposed to be a modern discovery\u2014an excellent example of those things which our ancestors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had known them , would have prevented the very beginnings of Christianity .\nActually , Ptolemy wasn \u2019 t even the first ; about 11 centuries before , King David seemed similarly aware of our tininess compared with the universe \u2019 s vastness .\nHe wrote in Psalm 8:3\u20135 : Various atheistic websites often portray the Middle Ages as the \u2018 Dark Ages \u2019 , where a backward Church persecuted scientists .\nHowever , this was the period where spectacles , mechanical clocks , and the blast furnace were invented ; universities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Dante wrote the masterpiece Divine Comedy and Chaucer wrote the Canterbury Tales ; Giotto di Bondone painted his masterpieces ; Western music was invented ; the great Gothic cathedrals were built ; and the first carnivals were held involving whole towns.1 It \u2019 s notable that even some atheists oppose this dishonesty .\nFor example , Australian skeptic Tim O \u2019 Neill is scathing about such arguments : \u201c It \u2019 s not hard to kick this nonsense to pieces , especially since the people presenting it know next to nothing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange ideas from websites and popular books .\nThe assertions collapse as soon as you hit them with hard evidence .\nI love to totally stump these propagators by asking them to present me with the name of one\u2014just one\u2014scientist burned , persecuted , or oppressed for their science in the Middle Ages .\nThey always fail to come up with any.\n\u201d 2 They often come up with Galileo\u2014laughable , since he lived at the same time as the KJV was being translated , centuries after the Middle Ages , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the only remaining excuse is that the evil Church had persecuted them so well that no one was brave enough to practise science .\nO \u2019 Neill responds : \u201c By the time I produce a laundry list of Medieval scientists\u2014like Albertus Magnus , Robert Grosseteste , Roger Bacon , John Peckham , Duns Scotus , Thomas Bradwardine , Walter Burley , William Heytesbury , Richard Swineshead , John Dumbleton , Richard of Wallingford , Nicholas Oresme , Jean Buridan and Nicholas of Cusa\u2014and ask why these men were happily pursuing science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church , my opponents usually scratch their heads in puzzlement at what just went wrong.\n\u201d Actually , for real persecution of scientists , try the fanatically anti-Christian French Revolution .\nThe ruling National Convention guillotined the great founding father of chemistry , Antoine Lavoisier ( 1743\u20131794 ) .3 \u2022 Esolen , A. , Professor of English at Providence College , Were the Middle Ages Dark ?\nPrager University videos , February 2014 .\n\u2022 O \u2019 Neill , T. , The Dark Age Myth : An atheist reviews God \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; bold in original .\n\u2022 An apocryphal story has the condemning judge say , \u201c The Republic has no need for scientists.\n\u201d So why is the universe so big ?\nThe absurd historical revisionism of modern critics almost implies that God needed a small universe to exist .\nBut if the universe were small , then these same critics would probably complain , \u201c If God is so great , then why didn \u2019 t He create anything else ?\n\u201d 8 Somehow modern antitheists like Tyson and Hawking think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profound disproof of God .\nHowever , as the Psalmist declared , the heavens are big to \u201c declare the glory of God \u201d ( Psalm 19:1 ) .\nEarth at the centre of the universe Another supposed refutation of biblical Christianity is the discovery that the earth rotates on its axis and revolves around the sun .\nAs above , Neil Tyson claimed that this was virtually unknown in 1599 .\nThis was an inexcusable blunder ; the best known founder of geokinetic ( earth-moving ) ideas , Nicolaus Copernicus ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a century previously .\nFurthermore , the Gregorian calendar , adopted in 1582 , was \u201c based on computations that made use of Copernicus \u2019 work \u201d , as pointed out by leading philosopher of science , Thomas Kuhn ( 1922\u20131996 ) .2 Copernicus certainly didn \u2019 t see his ideas as anti-Christian , because he was a canon of the church .\nCopernicus \u2019 s ideas were then popularized by Galileo Galilei ( 1564\u20131642 ) and Johannes Kepler ( 1571\u20131630 ) , and they accepted them before 1599 .\nAs early as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Like you , I accepted the Copernican position several years ago , \u201d and Kepler replied suggesting collaboration and coming out publicly .\nHowever , the main problems were that their view contradicted the scientific establishment of the day , which taught the Aristotelian/Ptolemaic view that the earth was at the absolute centre of the universe.3 Galileo saw his geokinetic view as compatible with the Bible,4 and Kepler was a devout Lutheran who claimed to be \u201c thinking God \u2019 s thoughts after Him , \u201d and saw no conflict between his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated a creation date of 3993 \u2014he , like the others , would be called a \u2018 young-earth creationist \u2019 today !\n5 The above scientists should be well known , even to Tyson .\nNot so well known , although they should be , were their medieval predecessors.6 Long before Copernicus , in the late Middle Ages , several clergy-scientists had safely proposed geokinetic ideas .\nE.g .\nthe French priest and scientist John Buridan ( c. 1300\u2013 after 1358 ) , also a notable logician who solved various versions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geokinetic ideas .\nIronically , a major reason was precisely the relative tininess of the earth that atheists have claimed was a modern discovery .\nThat is , Buridan proposed that it would be more elegant if the tiny earth rotated rather than the vast cosmos revolved around it .\nPh.D. historian of science James Hannam says : \u201c Like many medieval Christians , Buridan expected God to have arranged things in an elegant way , always allowing that he could do as he pleased .\nHowever , although there was a presumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check the empirical facts to see if God really operated this way.\n\u201d 8,9 Buridan also refuted scientific objections , such as Ptolemy \u2019 s claim that a moving earth would produce a massive wind .\nThe answer lay in Buridan \u2019 s concept of impetus , essentially the same as the modern concept of momentum , and anticipating Galileo \u2019 s idea of inertia and Newton \u2019 s First Law of Motion by several centuries.10 That is , the earth would impart an impetus to the air , which would move along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice it .\nBuridan compared it with being on a smoothly moving river boat : the boat shares its motion with everything on it , so passengers can forget they are moving .\nAnd if they looked outside at an anchored boat , they could easily think that the other boat was the one moving .\nBuridan \u2019 s student Nicole Oresme ( c. 1320\u20131382 ) , a bishop , mathematician , and physicist , refined this further .\nHe argued that the earth would impart an impetus to everything on it\u2014air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth \u2019 s rotation as well .\nOresme also realized that many of the biblical passages that were later hijacked to support dogmatic geocentrism were equivocal .\nThat is , they used the earth as a convenient reference frame because it reflected everyday perception , that is , \u201c by saying that this passage conforms to the normal use of popular speech just as it does in many other places \u2026 which are not to be taken literally.\n\u201d 11,12 Hannam says : \u201c What Oresme had done was prepare the groundwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a moving earth two centuries before Copernicus had suggested that it might actually be in motion.\n\u201d 8 \u2022 Copernicus , N. , De revolutionibus orbium coelestium ( On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres ) , 1543 .\n\u2022 See also Sarfati , J. , Galileo Quadricentennial : Myth

"christianministriesinternational", "title": "Reclaiming the rainbow", "content": "Over recent years one particular social and political movement has appropriated common words and symbols to its own cause .\nThis has been done by LGBT+ campaign groups , and the organisers of the pride marches .\nThe word gay has changed its meaning from the historical sense ; and now the rainbow has been adopted on to the so-called \u2018 pride flag \u2019 ; more commonly known as the rainbow flag .\nAlthough still professing to be a discriminated minority , the LGBT+ movement has become politically dominant in most Western nations , with pride marches often supported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies .\nAs such , the rainbow flag has become widely recognised as a symbol of gay pride , but biblically , God promised that the rainbow would be a symbol of something completely different .\nWhile society can live with a few misappropriated words and phrases , the adoption of the rainbow by a small group of people causes disquiet or even consternation to many Christian believers .\nThe reason is that it is the traditional , biblical symbol of God \u2019 s mercy to all humanity\u2014not just Christians .\nBut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now hard for people outside the LGBT+ community to use the rainbow as a symbol without the risk of giving a false impression .\nIt has also become a symbol of support for the National Health Service in the UK ; this was a deliberate move , \u201c created to be a way for NHS staff to demonstrate that they are aware of the issues that LGBT+ people can face when accessing healthcare.\n\u201d 1 The first gay pride rainbow flags were produced for the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade , held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag , designed by Gilbert Baker , had eight stripes , where each colour had a different meaning .\nBaker stated that : \u201c Pink is for sex , red for life , orange for healing , yellow for sun .\n\u2026 Green for nature , turquoise for magic , blue for serenity and purple for the spirit \u201d .2 Later this morphed into the six-striped flag , which is often used today in pride marches around the world , although flags with many more colours are appearing .\nThe flag is portrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversity , but it misrepresents the true form of Christian agap\u0113 love , which is self-less and giving , and where sexual love is confined to monogamous marriage between one man and one woman ( see : 1 Corinthians 13:4\u20137 ) .\nInstead , the pride flag associates love with sexual diversity and selfish pleasure seeking .\nThe term gay changed its meaning during the 1960s and 1970s from that of happy and carefree , to that of homosexual , or more specifically male homosexual .\nThe more traditional understanding is exemplified in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u201c The child that is born on the Sabbath day is blithe and bonny , and good and gay.\n\u201d As I was born on a Sunday , at a young age I recall being taught this stanza from the rhyme with approval .\nOf course , to think our birth day has any influence on our lives is really superstitious nonsense , but it does show how the word gay long had a different meaning unrelated to sexual orientation or activity.3,4 So , along with certain words , the rainbow has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent years , one that is in opposition to Christian values ( and on rare occasions used to vandalize Christian memorials ) .\nThis has occurred even though it has been a religious symbol for several millennia .\nWithin Jewish and Christian teaching , the rainbow has been , and continues to be , a symbol of God \u2019 s promise to humankind , never to flood the earth again .\nFollowing the judgment of the great Flood ( Genesis 6\u20138 ) God said to Noah that ( Genesis 9:11 ) : The @ @ @ @ @ @

harvest , cold and heat , summer and winter , day and night , shall not cease \u201d ( Genesis 8:22 ) .\nThe rainbow , then , is a symbol of God \u2019 s covenantal promise to all mankind , and of God

he was shown the rainbow as a covenant promise .\nLikewise , Christ experienced death , spending three days in the grave , before his resurrection and ascension into heaven through clouds into glory ( Luke 24:51 ; Acts 1:9 ) .\nWhile the Acts and Luke accounts do not mention a rainbow , the image of a rainbow forms part of a vision of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Revelation 4:2\u20136 ) .\nChrist is seen seated in the midst of glory surrounded by angels : John \u2019 s vision continues in Revelation 10:1\u20136 where he sees a mighty angel with \u201c a rainbow over his head \u201d .\nSome Bible commentators see this as another picture of Christ , with the voice described to be like that of a lion \u2019 s roar , and the message as the sound of thunder.5 Similarly , in the first chapter of Ezekiel ( 1:26\u201328 ) , a messianic vision is recorded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c likeness with a human appearance \u201d seated upon a glorious throne of fiery sapphire .\nIn verse 28 we read , \u201c Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain , so was the appearance of the brightness all around.\n\u201d So , in the Bible the rainbow is seen as a sign of the covenant promise of mercy and peace following the Flood , and it is also used symbolically to describe the glory of the soon-coming Messiah .\nClearly , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a universal symbol of God \u2019 s mercy , and of hope for all of mankind .\nIts appropriation by a pressure group profanes this divinely ordained symbol .\nWhile the rainbow is a symbol of mercy , God is not mocked (

.\nWhereas the most common pride flag has six colours , seventeenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually contained seven colours , mirroring the musical scale , which has seven major notes,6 although in reality the colours of the rainbow are continuous ; see : Rainbows , the Flood , and the Covenant .\nThe rainbow is evidence of God \u2019 s design and wonder in the world , which adds to the beauty of creation , and human existence , and should lead to praise and worship.7 The primary rainbow is produced by the refraction and reflection of white light inside many raindrops .\nThe light is separated into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the slightly different wavelengths of each colour .\nSometimes , a secondary weaker bow is visible , produced by a double reflection within the raindrops ; therefore , it is reversed and observed higher in the sky .\nThere is also a dark band between the two bows , called the Alexander band ( named after Alexander of Aphrodisias who first described it around 200 ) .\nIn this band ( region of sky ) all reflected light is directed away from the observer .\nAs Christian believers we should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a universal symbol of God \u2019 s love and mercy towards mankind , and not allow it be captured by single issue pressure groups .\nSuch mis-appropriation undermines the ability of others to use the symbol for sacred purposes .\nThe image of Christ , who is pictured in several biblical visions seated in judgement over the affairs of men , is tempered by the adornment of the rainbow as an ongoing symbol of peace and mercy to those who repent and turn to him .", "author": "", "url": "https://creation.com/a/16132", "published": "Thu, 03 Nov 2022 05:00:00 +1300", "published_utc": 1667466000, "collection_utc": 1667471126}, {"id":

not for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and preserving Scripture , surely there are possible worlds where God doesn \u2019 t inspire or preserve any Scripture .\nIf God can exist by himself , He needs no scripture .\nIf it \u2019 s possible for God to make a world with no creaturely moral agents , He needs no scripture .\nIf God can make a world where nobody ever sins , He plausibly needs no scripture .\nIf God

have to give any sinners a chance at salvation , He may still choose to .\nBut Sanders doesn \u2019 t even go this far .\nTo see why , it \u2019 s important to consider the standpoint from which the

which they are found .\nConsequently , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was believed that larger crystals require slower cooling to form .\nThis contradiction was a direct result of the misplaced idea that granite formations need multi-million-year cooling times .\nThe new study has revealed the answer to the mystery .\nFluids , such as water , play a crucial role in rapid gemstone growth .\nGranitic magma contains a lot of dissolved water .\nAs the magma cools , and the quartz and feldspar crystals form , the leftover magma becomes very watery , which drastically drops the crystallization temperature .\nIf cracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly fluid , water-rich magma instantly rushes into the new spaces .\nThis suddenly reduces the pressure and the magma cools very quickly , creating ideal conditions for the crystals to grow .\nThe key is that the crystal growth occurs in an extremely thin layer ( microns thick ) between the crystal and the liquid .\nThis growth happens very quickly but requires a runny dynamic liquid .\nLarge gemstones such as emerald can form within minutes to hours .\nThis is of course far less time than geologists once believed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lead researcher Patrick

rare-earth magnets .\nThey are much stronger than previous magnets\u2014they can hold thousands of times their own weight .\nIn fact , they must be handled with care : two magnets can attract so strongly that they pinch soft tissue dangerously or fly together with such force that shrapnel is thrown off .\nRare-earth magnets are essential for electric vehicles and wind turbines .\nThey are also important in computer hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudspeakers , and hand-powered flashlights .\nBut what is a \u2018 rare earth \u2019 ?\n\u2018 Rare earth \u2019 is the name of a group of metals called the lanthanides , plus scandium and yttrium .\nThe main rare earths in magnets are neodymium , alloyed with iron and boron ( e.g.\n, Nd Fe B ) ; and samarium , alloyed with cobalt ( either SmCo or Sm Co with a smattering of other elements ) .\nHowever , the major problem with rare earths is their availability .\nNote , NOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plentiful than tin , while neodymium is about five times more common\u2014about as plentiful as cobalt , nickel , or copper .\nThe problem is mining it : they are not in concentrated seams , so a lot of material must be mined to extract enough of the metal .\nSo the mines are quite environmentally disruptive .\nAnd at present , one country has almost a monopoly on rare earth production : China.1 Scientists have been looking for alternatives : other materials that could produce powerful magnets that would be easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of magnetic materials is called maximum energy product , also called ( BH ) max .\n( BH ) max describes the maximum magnetic field of a unit of material .\nThis is often measured in MG\u00b7Oe ( mega-gauss-oersted ) , where 1 MG\u00b7Oe = 7.958 kJ/m3 .\n( BH ) max of KS Steel , used in older permanent magnets , is only about 1 MG\u00b7Oe .\nBefore rare-earth magnets , the best were made from Alnico ( aluminium nickel cobalt alloy ) , which had a ( BH ) max ~5.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by samarium magnets , ( BH ) max ~33 MG\u00b7Oe .\nNeodymium magnets are even stronger , ( BH ) max ~50 MG\u00b7Oe .\nSo there was no known alternative to rare earth magnets on Earth .\nHowever , one candidate came from outside Earth : a mineral discovered in a meteorite , an iron-nickel alloy called tetrataenite ( FeNi ) .\nThe name comes from another iron-nickel alloy in meteorites called taenite .\nWhile taenite is cubic , tetrataenite is tetragonal ( four-fold symmetry ) .\nIn 2014 , researchers discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ~Fe Ni ) had excellent magnetic properties .\nIn particular , ( BH ) max could be up to 42 MG\u00b7Oe .\nThat is , tetrataenite is better than samarium magnets and almost as good as neodymium magnets.2 However , one obstacle is that it was thought to take millions of years to form .\nThe thinking was : it is hard to get atoms in a metal to diffuse to the correct positions to develop the needed four-fold symmetry .\nSo , it would require a vast amount of time as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small amounts of tetrataenite by bombarding iron-nickel alloys with neutrons to enable the atoms to move .\nHowever , this is energy intensive and unsuitable for mass production .\nBut materials scientists recently made a breakthrough .\nThey discovered the non-metallic element phosphorus in meteorites containing tetrataenite .\nThey realized that a small amount of phosphorus atoms enabled the nickel and iron atoms to diffuse much faster .\nSo they realized that making tetrataenite could be as simple as melting the three elements together .\nThe team leader , Professor Lindsay Greer from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Materials Science & Metallurgy , described it as follows : What was so astonishing was that no special treatment was needed : we just melted the alloy , poured it into a mold , and we had tetrataenite .\nThe previous view in the field was that you couldn \u2019 t get tetrataenite unless you did something extreme , because otherwise you \u2019 d have to wait millions of years for it to form .\nThis result represents a total change in how we think about this material.3 In fact , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis means that the formation was speeded up by an amazing 11 to 15 orders of magnitude ( magnitude = power of 10 , so the formation was accelerated 1011\u20131015 times ) .\nThe original paper concluded in the abstract : First , creationists love good operational science like this .\nThis science involves observation , testing , and repetition .\nIn fact , science depends on biblical assumptions and flourished under a biblical worldview .\nBiblical creationists founded most branches of science , and many scientific laws and quantities were named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something very different : the weak historical sciences of uniformitarian geology and evolutionary biology .\nSecond , this is only one of many examples of things wrongly thought to take millions of years , contrary to the Bible .\nLong-agers have been using such \u2018 evidence \u2019 for many years , only for it to fall flat when a much faster formation method was discovered .\nFor example , granite and large rock crystals can form much faster than evolutionists claimed , if water is present.5 Opals need only weeks to months to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not long ages.6 Water can also speed up gemstone growth by four orders of magnitude .\nUnder the right conditions , diamonds can form in minutes , not needing millions of years .\nMudstone was thought to require extremely slow settling from almost still water .\nIn reality , it can settle quickly from fast-flowing water .\nSo next time you hear of

genetically more similar to apes than to jellyfish\u2014or to bananas , for that matter .\nAnd what about the much-vaunted ape language abilities ?\nThese researchers remind us that the circumstances were artificial .\nSeyfarth says , \u201c You can teach a bear to ride a bicycle in the circus , but it doesn \u2019 t tell you much about what bears learn to do in the wild.\n\u201d 8 And furthermore

sympathetic entity called human consciousness \u201d .8 This is because , he should have added , we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Made to think , reason , love and communicate with our Creator .\nApes and monkeys , no matter how superficially similar , were not .\nAs Seyfarth concludes , \u201c They \u2019 re not furry little humans .\nThey \u2019 re just monkeys.\n\u201d 5 One increasingly hears phrases such as \u2018 humans and other animals \u2019 .\nThis seems to be intended to attack the notion that people are special , being made in the image of God .\nThe answer to the question \u2018 is man an animal ?\n\u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one .\nIn the technical biological sense , using the man-made classification criteria instituted by the creationist Linnaeus , the answer would seem to be \u2018 yes \u2019 .\nMan is obviously not a plant , or a bacterium .\nCreatures are grouped together using various criteria of similarity , which do not need to have any evolutionary overtones .\nWe obviously have backbones , which would place us in the group known as vertebrates .\nWe give birth to live young , suckle our offspring , and so on , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placental mammals .\nFurthermore , we have many features in common with the group known as primates .\nBut the problem is not so much with technical classification as with the \u2018 propagandistic \u2019 effect that labelling people as \u2018 animals \u2019 achieves .\nThe real point that evolutionists try to make , and which should be resisted , is that man is \u2018 just one more animal \u2019 .\nThe potential for confusion is particularly strong because the word \u2018 animal \u2019 , in the layperson \u2019 s understanding , means something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when people say , \u2018 animals are used to test cosmetics \u2019 , it is obvious that man is not included in this use of the term \u2018 animals \u2019 .\n( Equally , fish , insects and birds , though technically \u2018 animals \u2019 , are not usually talked about that way .\nE.g .\n\u2018 The fire injured many animals and birds \u2019 . )\nPeople are definitely not \u2018 animals \u2019 in any normal sense of that word , nor are they related to animals by common descent .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ image of their Creator , and an awesome gulf separates them from even the most similar of any other living creatures ( see main article ) .\nThe ultimate solution might be a separate kingdom in technical classification to adequately reflect that fact .\nHowever , this is unlikely to appear anytime soon in a world dominated by evolutionary thinking .\nIn the meantime , when asked whether man is \u2018 an animal \u2019 , the best way to avoid fostering evolutionary notions may be to : \u2022 Carefully point out the different @ @ @ @ @ @

, London , 2020 The subtitle of this book will be attractive to scores of readers for a variety of reasons\u2014some interested in the science , but presumably many more wanting to find out how this could affect their life-span .\nThe science-seekers are more richly rewarded than those looking to significantly extend their lives .\nIt may sound rather obvious to state that ageing is the main cause of death , but the author considers that the \u201c humanitarian challenge of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ( p. 315 ) ; he believes that only 25 % of lifespan is genetically determined ( p. 230 ) .\nSo , who is the author ?\nEvolutionist Andrew Steele obtained a PhD in physics from the University of Oxford .\nHowever , he then changed direction to study computational biology , working at the Francis Crick Institute studying DNA , and using Artificial Intelligence to predict heart attacks from medical records .\nHe recognises that many of the ailments of old age are rooted precisely in the senescence that inevitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in combatting sicknesses resulting from old age , and rightfully so .\nBut what if we were to take a step back and \u2018 heal \u2019 people before they get sick , Steele ponders ?\nThis is the thought that underlies the book \u2019 s thesis , hence its title , Ageless : The new science of getting older without getting old.2 Its 315 pages of text are divided into three parts .\nThe first lays the groundwork and describes the problem .\nThe second ( in-depth ) deals with things that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last part discusses more mundane matters , such as what steps individuals like you and I can take now , and how this topic can be put on the agenda .\nIt also links to a bonus chapter ( # 12 ) about the ethics of it all .\nThere are also 57 pages of detailed notes and bibliography ( although not especially easy to navigate ) .\nDeath , the card we are dealt ?\nFrom the Bible we know that death is an enemy that believers confidently believe will ultimately be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corinthians 15:26 ) .\nPrior to Adam \u2019 s original sin , death was non-existent in God \u2019 s perfect creation .\nNevertheless , ever since the Fall , death is a reality that comes to everyone , except for those found alive when Jesus returns ( 1 Thessalonians 4:15 ) .\nAndrew Steele relays the sobering statistic that our risk of death roughly doubles every eight years ( see the blue data points in Fig .\n1 ) \u2014this is a rule of thumb .\nA few anchor , or \u2018 calibrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig .\n1 ; not based on the doubling algorithm ) paint a slightly more accurate picture between the ages of 65 and 80 .\nSteele \u2019 s main intention is to find ways to \u2018 flatten the curve \u2019 , not merely by delaying death , but by helping people to live healthy , vigorous lives , even at a ripe old age.3 He thinks this is possible .\nInterestingly , the main objection he receives to this proposal is not \u2018 How it could be accomplished ?\n\u2019 , but \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more people lived longer ?\n\u2019 There are many people who would prefer to see the world \u2019 s population smaller , not least of whom is Sir David Attenborough ( see the section \u2018 Populations \u2019 in our article , Life on this planet is fleeting ) .\nHowever , Steele retaliates ( to this and other objections ) , by turning the question back on the sceptics ( p. 14 ) : \u201c Would you invent aging to solve one of these problems ?\n\u201d Steele is pragmatic though , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his cause ( laymen , but also scientists and politicians ) , is to help people become accustomed to the idea\u2014hence this book.4 Readers of Ageless quickly discover Steele \u2019 s strong evolutionary worldview .\nHe makes it clear that evolution is , \u201c perhaps the only true universal principle in biology \u201d ( p. 34 ) .\nAnd more strongly still , he states : That \u2019 s right !\nAccording to Steele , no matter what the facts might indicate , the evolutionary paradigm is supreme .\nHe believes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question would have to be \u2018 rethought \u2019 instead of rethinking evolution\u2014a preposterous idea if you think about it .\nThis is clear from the following : How does the latter connect with Steele \u2019 s thesis ?\nHis strategy to \u201c truly cure ageing \u201d is to address the whole \u201c complex system of components interacting in tangled networks \u201d ( p. 255 ) .\nKeep in mind that this complex system is , he believes , cobbled together by a random , chance process .\nHis is virtually a religious view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics to evolution as an intelligent entity,5 Steele believes that we need to lend evolution a hand : Natural selection is the requirement of differential reproduction .\nThat is , an advantageous alteration to a gene\u2014the result of a mutation\u2014can become established in a population only if that individual has more surviving offspring ( also carrying the beneficial change ) than its neighbours .\nAny ostensibly-beneficial mutations occurring after an ageing creature has ceased its reproduction efforts can not be passed to the next generation , and thus are irrelevant in the scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains terminology and discussion pertaining to medicine , parts and processes of the body , as well as damage to genes of the nuclear DNA , and mitochondrial DNA mutations .\nLet \u2019 s first focus on the latter .\nMitochondria are the site of formation of a lot free radicals ( reactive oxygen species , or ROS ) .6 The latter can damage DNA , including mitochondrial DNA , so some researchers see anti-oxidants ( free radical scavengers ) , which target mitochondria , as having real potential to prevent damage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that Steele sees everything , especially biology , in the light of evolution.7 Perhaps , then , we shouldn \u2019 t be surprised that he makes the following \u201c outlandish re-engineering proposal \u201d ( p. 211 ) : His idea of a \u2018 fix \u2019 is to somehow store a backup copy of the mitochondrial DNA information in the cell \u2019 s nucleus .\nHe claims that \u201c it \u2019 s actually finishing a job that evolution started , but has never quite got round to completing \u201d ( p. 211 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 allegedly goes back one billion years , when a single-celled organism got into a symbiotic relationship with a completely different unicellular life form which it had engulfed.8 In other words , the DNA of that ancient unicellular organism later became the mitochondrial DNA of all multicellular life , including ourselves.9 As already indicated , a significant problem that underlies ageing is damage to our DNA .\nThinking of our nuclear DNA , Steele informs us that \u201c an average cell is thought to take up to 100,000 hits to its DNA daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repairs , this would be catastrophic .\nSteele describes the repair mechanisms as \u201c mind-blowing , \u201d and says there are \u201c hundreds of different genes to spot problems , cry for help and excise any damage , showing us without doubt that this is of serious concern to our bodies \u201d ( p. 215 ) .\nThis is quite true of course , but he does not explain how these surveillance and repair mechanisms came about over deep time by a random , goal-less process .\nYet , he has no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolve !\nSteele points out that many genetic mutations do not get repaired because the changes do not call up a different amino acid.10 These are called \u2018 synonymous \u2019 ( or \u2018 silent \u2019 ) mutations and , until recently , most geneticists would have thought that Steele \u2019 s conclusion was right .\nHowever , it turns out , from very recent research ( reported since Ageless was published ) , that these silent changes are not so harmless after all ( see Mutations are more harmful than we thought ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no explanation for where that genetic redundancy comes from .\nIt is not something that would develop spontaneously , especially as it requires forethought .\nThe book describes some experiments that not all readers will appreciate .\nLeaving aside those involving animals , the author \u2019 s seemingly callous view of unborn human life is sad , but typical of many ardent evolutionists .\nMuch of the genetic approach to combatting ageing revolves around stem cells .\nIn some trials , they believed that they had to use embryonic stem cells ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves ) .\nSteele comments , \u201c The patients therefore needed to take immunosuppressive drugs to stop their immune system from attacking the new cells \u201d ( p. 162 ) .\nThe more pertinent point is that his ongoing discussion reveals that he has no misgivings regarding the embryonic life involved .\nThe following might initially sound positive : \u201c Unfortunately , \u2026 [ stem cells ] can only be extracted from aborted foetuses at a specific stage in development ; \u201d that is , until you read why he feels it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would severely limit the availability of this treatment \u201d .\nCMI believes that all the scientists doing such research should source the required cells for their studies without the use of aborted foetuses .\nFor much more on this ethically challenging and important issue , see here .\nMany people will be sceptical about stopping\u2014or even slowing down\u2014the ageing process .\nAnd Christians might also object on separate grounds from biology .\nAs the Apostle Paul pointed out , believers ultimately look beyond this present world .\nIt \u2019 s true that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , \u201d but \u201c we look [ forward ] \u2026 to the things that are unseen \u201d ( 2 Corinthians 4:16 , 18 ) .\nWe look forward to the eternal reality when \u201c what is mortal [ is ] swallowed up by life .\nHe who has prepared us for this very thing is God , who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee \u201d ( 2 Corinthians 5:4\u20135 ) .\nComing back to the biological objections , bear in mind that , prior to Noah \u2019 s Flood at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 900s .\nAgeless gives many lines of future research , with seemingly good prospects of making an extension to people \u2019 s lifespans .\nAt no point , though , does the author mention biblical ages or considerations .\nWhile unsurprising , such things are surely vital to any discussion of human lifespans .\nStill , Andrew Steele does end his book by providing a list of 11 things that will likely help expand our expected lifespan in the here and the now\u2014most of it readily understandable and common sense , e.g .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ is guaranteed for those whose name is in the book of Life ( see for instance Revelation

example , the gradual transformation of one family of genes to another has never been observed , indeed it can not even be observed .\nThe de novo appearance of genes from random non-coding sequence has also never been observed .\nEvolutionary conservation of genes is also an oxymoron\u2014how can proteins manage to evolve by staying the same for millions of years ?\n1 Doppelganger genes perform the same function and have highly similar structures , appearing in two distinct clades far from one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the gene which codes the protein prestin , which plays a role in echolocation , is expressed in the inner ear of whales and bats.3 While it is broadly present in a number of vertebrate animals , it is also present in species of Ascomycetes as well as Blastocystis .\nThis latter group of heterokont parasites belongs to a larger group called Stramenopiles , which includes organisms such as algae , diatoms , and water moulds .\nBesides their structural similarity , doppelganger genes also show sequential similarity with one another .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in unrelated organisms , and have the same function , albeit with totally different structures .\nThey are thought to arise via convergent evolution , although it is difficult to understand how completely different sequences can give shape to the same structure .\nDoppelganger genes pose a serious problem to evolutionary theory .\nThe same , or very similar , sequences of mutations would have had to occur in different DNA sequences in two different branches of the evolutionary tree to produce two genes that are very homologous to one another .\nTo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same kind of gene once existed in all of the organisms leading from the common ancestor of the two clades all the way up to the two clades themselves .\nAfterwards , all of these genes were lost in the intermediate species connecting the two clades during several rounds of massive gene deletion .\nThe probabilities of these events occurring are extremely low .\nA much simpler explanation is that these genes are created functional units which already existed in disjunct clades ; that is , baramins .\nThese proteins differ according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cell produces several proteins , which fulfil their function in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) or the thylakoid membrane in bacteria .\nThese proteins contain a hydrophobic signal sequence at their N-terminus which tells the signal recognition particle ( SRP ) complex to translocate them into the ER .\nThe SRP complex is a cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein\u2014a multi-unit macromolecule made up of proteins and RNA .\nThe different components of the SRP complex are shown in figure 1 .\nThe SRP consists of two domains , the S domain and the Alu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of SRP19 , 54 , 68 , and 72 , is responsible for binding the nascent signal sequence by SRP54 as it arises from the ribosome .\nThis process is called \u2018 elongation arrest \u2019 .\nThe S domain is connected to the Alu domain by the SRP RNA .\nThe Alu domain is responsible for the elongation of proteins once they exit the ribosome and consists of the proteins SRP9 and 14.4 SRP14 has a very interesting distribution in living organisms , which classifies its encoding gene as a doppelganger gene .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ primates , bats , rodents , yeast , and even protists such as Plasmodium falciparum.5 Even though there are structural differences within different groups , they perform the same function.6 The Alu RNA structure of the Archaean Pyrococcus horikoshii is so similar to that of human that even the human SRP9/14 heterodimer can bind to it.7 Interestingly , the yeast SRP has no SRP9 homologue , yet still shows elongation arrest which is dependent upon two Srp14p proteins which substitute SRP9 .\nFurthermore , yeast also contains the protein Srp21p which has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are absent in Archaea and Eubacteria .\nHowever , Nakamura et al .\nthink that the histone-like protein HBsu from Bacillus subtilis is a functional analogue in Eubacteria .\nIn B. subtilis , this protein binds the Alu domain of the scRNA , which plays a role in membrane docking , the lack of which leads to depletion of extracellular enzymes.10 Since the structure and function of SRP14 is so conserved in very different organisms , their very existence is evidence of non-evolutionary stasis .\nFurthermore , the existence of functional SRP14 analogues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eukaryotes.11 Interestingly , in primates , the SRP14 protein contains a 16-amino-acid-long segment containing 15 alanines : A PA TA in its C-terminus .\nThis poly-alanine tract could be due to the expansion of the trinucleotide GCA , with the G mutating to A or C to get threonine ( T ) or proline ( P ) .\nHowever , the presence of the poly-alanine C-terminus does not confer any differential RNA-binding onto SRP14 , although this may not be important.12 The poly-alanine C-terminus is absent in some primates , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XP_008068029.1 ) and Microcebus murinus ( the Gray mouse lemur , XP_012621845.1 ) .\nAmong bats , the only known SRP14 protein that contains a poly-alanine C-terminus is found in Myotis lucifugus , the little brown bat ( G1PG47_MYOLU ) .\nIn M. lucifugus , the poly-alanine C-terminus is somewhat different than in primates , with a sequence of A GA .\nNevertheless , both primates and M. lucifugus share a stretch of nine alanines in their C-terminus .\nAn alignment of 11 SRP14 proteins from four primate and six bat species is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matrix comparing the sequence similarity between these 11 SRP14 proteins as well as the proteins \u2019 accession numbers are found in supplementary file 1 ( see \u2018 Materials and methods \u2019 section below ) .\nEven more interestingly , M. lucifugus has an X6 isoform of the SRP14 protein ( XP_006093069.1 ) , which is at least 98 % similar in its sequence to the SRP14 protein found in three other bat species : Hipposideros armiger , Pteropus alecto , and Rhinolophus ferrumequinuum .\nIn comparison , its other SRP14 isoform is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these three species .\nThe obvious question is , how did such sequentially different variants of the same gene arise in M. lucifugus ?\nDoes evolution really say that this one sequence underwent significant change in the life of this one bat species ?\nIt makes much more sense to view both the regular and the X6 isoforms of the SRP14 genes as separately created functional units .\nIt is as if God directly created a poly-alanine SRP14 protein isoform in M. lucifugus to defy evolution .\nFigure 3 shows a secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human , M. lucifugus , and R. ferrumequinuum .\nH stands for an amino acid which is a part of an alpha-helix , E for a

the protein motif GKKKISTVVSS , from positions 63 to 74 .\nBoth bat proteins contain the secondary structure TTTTTCEEEEETTTTTTCEEECTTCCCEETCTTTT , from positions 19 to 54 .\nHowever , M. lucifugus

relationships can be visualized based on sequential similarities .\nThe caveat is that since this baraminogram is based on the sequence identity matrix of a single protein , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results

isoform in the primate apobaramin , and 9.3 \u00d7 10\u201318 for the other isoform in the bat apobaramin ( see \u2018 stats \u2019 tab in supplementary file 1 ) .\nA silhouette plot also shows that there are four optimal clusters ( supplementary figure 1 ) .\nThe maximum silhouette value is 0.756 , which indicates statistically significant clusters .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic SRP14 isoforms , the poly-alanine isoform present in the primate apobaramin , as well as the non-poly-alanine isoform present mainly in the bat apobaramin .\nThe Myotis brandtii SRP14 ( EPQ10995.1 ) differs from the other bat non-polyalanine protein isoforms sequences due to a 30-amino-acid leader sequence in the N-terminus which is absent in the other protein sequences .\nThe distribution and sequence similarities of the SRP14 protein in the SRP complex are a thorny riddle for evolution .\nIts conserved structure and function in organisms from yeast to human defy evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFurthermore , analogous proteins in archaea and bacteria contradict gradual sequential variation in this protein over time .\nBesides this , the presence of the poly-alanine C-terminus isoform of SRP14 in primates and M. lucifugus is difficult for evolution to resolve .\nSince bats and primates are disjunct clades ( apobaramins ) , it is hard to explain how the same protein could even arise through random mutations in lineages leading up to these two groups .\nThis classifies SRP14 as a doppelganger gene .\nFurthermore , M. lucifugus has two different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different structure .\nHow evolution posits significant sequential changes within a single species , but also that the SRP14 protein is conserved all throughout the evolutionary tree , is difficult to understand .\nCreation theory offers a much simpler explanation without forcing the data into an evolutionary tree .\nRather , different protein isoforms , such as those seen in SRP14 , can be seen as discrete functional units created within individual species or baramins .\nAll protein sequences were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) database .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ three SRP14 proteins in figure 4 using

will be even better than the pre-Fall state ( cf .\nRomans 5:15\u201317 and 1 Corinthians 15:45\u201349 ) .\nAdam did get a second chance .\nHe was still alive and able to receive forgiveness after the Fall .\nWhether he took it or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say .\nNo , he didn \u2019 t get a second chance in the Garden of Eden before he died .\nBut that was because he was barred from accessing the Tree of Life .\nGod didn \u2019 t allow him the means to live forever with his fellowship with God broken .\nIt only takes one sin to break our fellowship with God .\nNot only is that fair , but it may even be a grace .\nAfter all , angels don \u2019 t die .\nCould that be why God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them ( Hebrews 2:16 ) ?\nWhether or not that is true , though , there \u2019 s no reason why God must \u2019 ve offered Adam a second chance in the Garden , and good reason for him not to .\nJesus \u2019 single death suffices to restore the whole cosmos ( Colossians 1:20 ) .\nThis is not unjust .\nThe injustice only arises if there are sapient ETs ( i.e .\nETs with moral agency ) on those planets disconnected from Adam \u2019 s family .\nThat is because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all creation , it only provides salvation from sin for those moral agents he is flesh-and-blood family with ( Hebrews 2:14\u201317 , see also Aliens and the Bible ) .\nPlus , God declared his purpose in subjecting us all to sin in Romans 11:32 : \u201c For God has consigned all to disobedience , that he may have mercy on all.\n\u201d But the scheme of salvation as set out in Scripture can not apply to sapient ETs .\nTherefore , they could not have been subjected to Adam \u2019 s curse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they existed : The Fall : a cosmic catastrophe ) so that God might have mercy on them .\nThere is no mercy available to them .\nIt follows , then , that God would \u2019 ve cursed them but offered them no chance of salvation , unlike with humans who actually did sin .\nSo , this would imply God is biased toward humans , who brought sin into the world , over against sapient ETs who didn \u2019 t .\nThat fits the very definition of partiality , i.e .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ person or group \u2019 .\nAnd yet , \u201c God shows no partiality \u201d ( Romans 2:11 ) .\nThus , the existence of sapient ETs , given the Bible \u2019 s history of redemption , is inconsistent with God \u2019 s character , and specifically his impartial justice , i.e .\nhis fairness .\nTherefore , God would not have created sapient ETs given the scheme of salvation set out in Scripture .\nThe reasoning in the above paragraph mirrors very closely Mr Lamb \u2019 s \u201c four points \u201d he used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be unfair to curse beings with human intelligence for the sin of Adam \u201d in his article God , the universe , tolerance and

God \u2019 s fairness that \u2019 s at stake in this issue .\nHere \u2019 s the problem : merely stating a counterclaim using a word like \u2018 unfair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critic \u2019 s claim has merit .\nIt is reasonable for us to call for reasons for why we should take their claims seriously , especially if we have already provided a case for our claim , as Mr Lamb did .\nIt \u2019 s their

of the strangest animals God ever created", "content": "Among the strangest animals ever created Pterosaurs ( \u2018 winged lizards \u2019 ) are some of the strangest animals God ever created .\nThey are classified as reptiles , but looked more like birds .\nThey had beaks\u2014some of the weirdest-looking in the animal kingdom .\nLike other reptiles , many had sharp-pointed teeth and comparatively long tails .\nUnlike most reptiles , however , many believe they were warm-blooded , a feature shared with birds and mammals .\nAnd the epidermal scales characteristic of reptiles have never been found in a pterosaur specimen .\nHowever , since reptiles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amniotic egg other than birds and synapsids ( mammals and extinct mammal-like creatures ) , pterosaurs qualify as reptiles by this definition .\nNonetheless , leading pterosaur scholar Professor David Unwin concluded they have a mosaic of features that baffles evolutionists.1 Overall , they were excellent fliers .\nOne authority even suggests they \u201c may have been more efficient fliers than the birds and bats that fill our skies today \u201d .2 Like birds , pterosaurs had strong but lightweight hollow bones , with walls as thin as playing cards.3 Their brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized much like in birds , and had the specialized features required for flight.4 They even had the keeled breastbone as used by birds for their flight muscle attachments .\nPterosaurs \u2019 wings , however , were more like those of bats ( which are mammals ) than those of birds .\nThey consisted of a membrane of leathery skin stretched between their body and their long fourth finger , called the wing finger .\nThis bone structure differs from that in bats \u2019 wings .\nPterosaurs flapped these wings like a bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to soar like an eagle for great distances .\nFrom afar , they would have looked like birds .\nThough some pterosaurs were as small as a robin , some approached the size of a small airplane .\nThe largest known flying animal that ever lived was a pterosaur , Quetzalcoatlus ( figure 1 ) , which had a wingspan around 10\u201311 metres ( 33\u201336 ft ) .5 Its massive head with skull , including the beak , was 1.5 m ( 5 ft ) long !\nBecause of the large size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to as \u2018 dragons of the air \u2019 .6 They are also sometimes called \u2018 flying dinosaurs \u2019 , though they are not dinosaurs .\nThere have been reports , based on fossil evidence , of feather-like \u2018 fuzz \u2019 covering pterosaurs .\nThis has led to claims of \u2018 proto-feathers \u2019 .\nBut on closer analysis it appears to be from the post-mortem breakdown of skin collagen.1,7 This is the same phenomenon likely to be responsible for claims of \u2018 feathers \u2019 in some dinosaurs.8 Evolutionists claim that pterosaurs were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also were the first vertebrates to fly .\nAlmost the entire design of a terrestrial animal would have to be modified to enable it to convert from a terrestrial to a flying animal .\nThere are no viable examples in the fossil record of \u2018 preflight \u2019 animals ( before flight was perfected ) leading up to the pterosaurs\u2014or any other flying creature for that matter .\nPterosaurs are the only creatures known to have had a unique tiny bone called a pteroid .\nThis articulated at the wrist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a moveable leading edge .\nAngling this flap could increase lift by 30 % , enabling take off in a light breeze , as well as allowing advanced aerodynamic manoeuvres and smooth landings.9 Pterosaurs share with bats and/or birds several specialized features that enable flight , some mentioned earlier .\nLarge wings , ultra-light skeletons and compact bodies are common to all three .\nSo it might be tempting for a lay evolution-believer to think that at least some such features were the result of common ancestry .\nBut this would contradict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so evolutionary paleontologists must hold that such similarities \u201c were not inherited from a common ancestor , but result from convergent evolution.\n\u201d 10 This means that these specialized traits are supposed to have evolved quite independently in each of the three groups .\nSuch a notion just multiplies the improbabilities involved in the idea of any of them having evolved from non-flying ancestors .\nMuch is still unknown about these creatures .\nWhat was the function of the prominent crest which most of them had on top of the head ( figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crest varies greatly according to species suggests that its function may have been to help them identify other members of their species for reproduction .\nAnother possibility is that it helped keep them cool .\nOr it may have helped with steering ( as a rudder ) while flying .\nIt may have even combined more than one of these functions .\nAlthough pterosaur eggs have been found,11 and even some baby pterosaurs ( one a mere 2 cm long ) , we know very little about their courting , mating and baby-rearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how did pterosaurs keep warm at night ?\nHow did they thermoregulate ?\nWhat effect did this have on their geographical range ?\nDid they avoid colder climates as most reptiles do today ?\nThe fact is that \u201c many questions concerning their biology and lifestyle remain unresolved \u201d .13 The \u201c clues are so cryptic , that we are still a long way from working out just how these amazing animals worked.\n\u201d 14 While in general agreement about how well they flew , scientists are even still debating the exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or no evidence exists for their origin from any non-pterosaur group .\nEven plausible \u2018 just-so \u2019 stories have to date eluded evolutionists .\nTheir best guess about pterosaur origins is that the reptile Scleromochlus ( see figure 3 ) , was their ancestor .\nThis animal had the body of a lizard with long , thin legs like a whooping crane , very different to any pterosaur .\nAnother study makes the case for lagerpetids ( a group of small terrestrial reptiles ) as pterosaur ancestors , but adds : \u201c \u2026 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is difficult to study how flight first evolved in this group.\n\u201d 16 The fossil record of pterosaurs is substantial ; good enough to classify them into 150 different species.17 Pterosaur fossils discovered in Germany in 2001 were so well-preserved that even wing structure details were clearly visible ( figure 4 ) .\nTheir fossils have been found on every continent except Antarctica.18 In spite of this , the long progression of fossils that evolutionists would postulate led up to the pterosaurs has never been found .\nIn response , several hypotheses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been proposed .\nResearchers are forced to conclude ( from their evolutionary perspective ) that the pterosaur fossil record is \u201c extremely incomplete \u201d .19 This is even though pterosaur paleobiology has been investigated since the early 19th century and its fossil record has in recent years greatly expanded.20 The first pterosaur was a complete pterosaur , and evidence of their progressive evolution from non-pterosaurs remains elusive .\nIn short , an enormous gap exists between them and all their imagined potential evolutionary ancestors .\nThis is consistent with biblical creation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pterosaur became extinct is still debated by secularists .\nWe live in a world in which the dying out of species is a frequent occurrence , whether from loss of habitat , disease , genetic entropy , predation ( including by humans ) , or some combination of these .\nSimilarly for pterosaurs ; there was likely not a single cause .\nSome challenge whether in fact they have all become extinct .\nOne basis for this was a rock painting in Utah that to some appeared to be a pterosaur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a coincidental alignment of separately painted figures.1 Two photos exist , each purporting to show a ( different ) batch of Civil War soldiers posing with what seems to be a ( different ) recently-killed pterosaur .\nHowever , these seem likely to have been staged in recent times , which helps explain discrepancies such as the enlisted men in one photo wearing belt buckles worn only by officers.2 Occasionally sightings are claimed by credible observers , such as airline pilots .\nIt is difficult , however , to verify whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pterosaur or a bird .\nEven judging the size would be difficult because there is rarely something else of known size in the same patch of sky to compare it with .\nWhile it is likely they are now extinct , it would not be a total surprise if some , perhaps the smaller robin-sized species , have survived into modern times .\n\u2022 Both

explained within biblical earth history.1,2,3 But these ice cores also show an apparent series of abrupt climate changes .\nAt first these appear to contradict biblical earth history , but volcanism during the post-Flood Ice Age provides a convincing explanation .\nThis ice core data caused a paradigm shift in glaciology4 from gradual to abrupt climate changes and has helped fuel fear of sudden and catastrophic future climate change .\nAbrupt climate changes became evident when glaciologists drilled two ice cores from the top to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early 1990s .\nSuperimposed on the general pattern of inferred temperature showing one Ice Age , about 25 sharp changes were detected ( figure 1 ) .\nSimilar changes were not found in Antarctic cores .\nBased on the greatly stretched-out secular time scale , these represent rapid temperature cooling changes for the Northern Hemisphere , at least in the North Atlantic region , of 10\u201320\u00b0C,5 each lasting an average of about 1,470 years ( within the evolutionary timeframe ) .\nMany other variables measured in the ice cores are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicating major climate change .\nThese fluctuations are named Dansgaard-Oescher ( D-O ) events , after two prominent researchers .\nThe most significant aspect of these \u2018 millennial-scale \u2019 climate oscillations is that the change from one state to another was very rapid : The change appears to have taken from a decade7 to as little as 1 to 3 years !\n8 Abrupt climate changes \u2018 seen \u2019 in other climate records .\nIt is amazing that abrupt climate shifts were rarely if ever seen in other post-Flood climate records before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cores .\nBut once these ice cores were analyzed , the idea of catastrophic climate shifts took hold .\nIt is interesting that researchers later \u2018 discovered \u2019 abrupt shifts in many other climatic data sets on land and sea , for instance in deep sea cores and lake pollen data.9 They are also seen in the tropics.10,11 Sarnthein et al .\nstate : I wonder , are we witnessing another example of the \u2018 bandwagon effect \u2019 , where deductions from one data set are \u2018 seen \u2019 in other data sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seen because of their previous assumptions .\nSecular scientists do not know the cause of these abrupt and truly radical climate changes , which has led to much speculation and debate : Dfijfhout and colleagues admit that climate models rarely demonstrate such shifts : Secular scientists suggest that the temperature passing some \u2018 threshold \u2019 results in such abrupt climate change into a new stable climate state\u2014radically colder or radically warmer .\nSome have even suggested that the current global warming trend could be such a \u2018 trigger \u2019 , once Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing catastrophic climate change .\nThis is one reason so many scientists and laypeople alike are extremely concerned about current global warming , despite it being only about 1\u00b0C , over half of it due to natural processes.16,17 Kendrick Taylor states : \u201c It is ironic that greenhouse warming may lead to rapid cooling in eastern North America , Europe and Scandinavia \u2026 \u201d 18 Because the \u2018 next \u2019 ice age is supposedly due soon , others claim : \u201c But warming could lead , paradoxically , to drastic cooling\u2014a catastrophe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 So , abrupt climate change records have fuelled global warming alarmism .\nAbrupt climate changes can be explained by the post-Flood Ice Age .\nI have suggested several times in the past that drastic climate changes were real and caused by decadal changes in volcanism.2 Numerous layers of volcanic ash , tephra , and acid are found in the Ice Age portion of the Greenland ice cores.20 A timescale measured in decades means that the oscillations can vary from a few years to several tens of years .\nThe decadal-scale peaks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in volcanism with time during the Ice Age ( figure 2 ) .\nWhile working on the Ice Age , I discovered that the amount of volcanic ash and very fine particles ( aerosols ) in the upper atmosphere ( reflecting sunlight back into space ) controlled the rate of ice sheet growth .\nDuring periods of strong volcanism , colder temperatures result in greater snowfall .\nThe opposite happens during volcanic lulls .\nThese temperature changes can be correlated to many other variables that change at the same time .\nSome secular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be caused by volcanism.21 Antarctica only shows seven to nine climate changes during the Ice Age , but these represent changes of only 1\u20132\u00b0C that are slow , not abrupt .\nThe differences between the abrupt changes in the Greenland Ice Sheet and the weak changes in the Antarctic Ice Sheet are attributable to different amounts of volcanism in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres , respectively.22 Since the latitude where volcanism takes place greatly affects the subsequent global cooling , fewer large eruptions in the Southern Hemisphere may be why the climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Northern Hemisphere .\nThis is supported by a simulation of a Northern Hemisphere eruption that generated \u201c an aerosol plume that is strictly confined to the Northern Hemisphere in the months following the eruption , with no direct radiative forcing on the tropical zone.\n\u201d 23 In other words , volcanism in the Northern Hemisphere does not change temperatures in the tropics , so logically would not cause temperature changes in the Southern Hemisphere .\nAbrupt climate changes unlikely to occur today Abrupt climate changes occurred only during the Ice Age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded temperature oscillations are associated with the highs and lows in a period of active global volcanism .\nTherefore , they give no support to the idea that abrupt climate changes caused by global warming or some other mechanism are likely to occur today.24 The samples of ice that accumulated after the Ice Age from the tops of both Antarctica and Greenland cores show only minor fluctuations , but no significant climate changes since the Ice Age

of Genesis 1:6\u20138 Among Bible interpreters , there is a notable lack of consensus regarding the identity of \u201c the waters that were above the expanse \u201d , which God separated from \u201c the waters that were under the expanse \u201d on Day 2 of Creation Week ( Genesis 1:7 ) .\nIn the Genesis account , the waters below are later given the name \u201c Seas \u201d ( Genesis 1:10 ) , but God does not name the waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nMany views have been offered , but most Bible readers subscribe to one of four positions which can be summarized using the following shorthand names : ( 1 ) a pre-Flood canopy , ( 2 ) a vaulted sea , ( 3 ) clouds , and ( 4 ) a cosmic shell .\nIn creationist circles , it was once popular to believe the first view\u2014that the earth was originally surrounded by a vapour canopy which collapsed at the time of Noah \u2019 s Flood to produce its 40 days and nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of favour due to its numerous biblical and scientific problems.1,2 Creationists also rightly reject the second view , held by liberal scholars , that the biblical authors conceived of the waters above as a liquid ocean suspended over a flat earth , held back by a solid vault in the sky .\nThis perspective is inconsistent with inerrancy , and it also has serious exegetical problems.3 My own view is that the waters above refer to clouds .\nThis view will not be defended here other than indirectly by way of critiquing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a shell of ice fragments or liquid water surrounding the entire universe .\nThough the cosmic shell view has become popular among contemporary creationists , it faces several challenges that require attention .\nWhile a form of the cosmic shell idea was advocated long ago by such historical figures as Martin Luther ( figure 1 ) , its modern incarnation was developed and popularized by creationist physicist Russell Humphreys.4 Similar views have been espoused by Faulkner and Mortenson.5,6 In Humphreys \u2019 model , on Day 1 God initially created a giant sphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth .\nThe sphere is equated with the primordial \u2018 deep \u2019 of Genesis 1:2 and its surface was \u201c the face of the deep \u201d over which the spirit of God hovered .\nOn Day 2 , God allegedly split this sphere into a much smaller inner sphere and a larger outer shell of water , leaving empty space in between .\nThe inner sphere was to undergo further changes during Creation Week to become more like the earth as we know it , with its now familiar dry land , oceans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Humphreys proposed , God pushed the upper shell of \u2018 waters above \u2019 outward so that the \u2018 expanse \u2019 ( raqiya \u2018 ) between the two bodies of water quickly grew to envelop all of what would become \u201c interstellar space \u201d .7 As the shell of upper waters rapidly receded from proto-Earth , it thinned to form a spherical halo ( or cosmic shell ) surrounding the entire universe , quickly reaching a size of at least 24 billion light-years in diameter.8 This shell need not have remained in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to Humphreys .\nHe says that it may now be in the form of \u201c a tenuous veil of ice particles , or perhaps broken up into planet-sized spheres of water with thick outer shells of ice.\n\u201d 8 Faulkner believes instead that the use of the Hebrew term \u2018 waters \u2019 ( mayim ) indicates that they somehow managed to remain in a liquid state.9 Humphreys , Faulkner , and Mortenson all claim that the cosmic shell view is the most natural reading of the text .\nThe waters above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist , because they were positioned \u201c above the expanse \u201d which was named \u201c Heaven \u201d on Day 2 ( Genesis 1:7\u20138 ) , and God set the stars \u201c in \u201d that very \u201c expanse of the heavens \u201d on Day 4 ( Genesis 1:14\u201319 ) .\nBut it \u2019 s not so simple .\nHere are three exegetical reasons why the cosmic shell view should be reconsidered , and why the waters above need not have been placed beyond the stars .\nThe cosmic shell view is at odds with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known elements of the world and their relationship to humanity .\nA careful reading of the creation account shows that it is concerned with letting readers know that God alone created the basic constituents of the world which were familiar to the ancients .\nIt is also plainly concerned with mankind \u2019 s position and role within the created order .\nWhy would esoteric materials hidden at the edge of the universe be discussed in such an account ?\nAll of the other items that God created according to Genesis 1 were familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original Israelite audience .\nGenesis describes in simple terms God \u2019 s creation of day and night ; the land and seas ; vegetation ; the sun , moon , and stars ; creatures that swim , fly , and walk ; and mankind .\nAll of these have important functions related to human beings .\nLand , sea , and sky were basic regions of the world that ancient Israelites could encounter .\nCelestial bodies with their daily cycle of light and dark were to serve as calendars , light sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nPlants were given as food for man and beast ( vv .\n29\u201330 ) .\nAnimals of land , sea , and sky were to be ruled over by mankind ( v. 28 ) .\nBy contrast with these familiar items and their relationships to humanity , any water billions of light-years from Earth could not have been observed by the ancients nor have had any relevance to daily life in the ancient Near East .\nIf these were the \u2018 waters \u2019 the author of Genesis had in mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the text at all , let alone given the prominent attention they receive as a feature of Day 2 .\nFurthermore , there is no hint in Genesis 1 nor the rest of the Bible that God intended to reveal secrets about the largescale structure of the cosmos which could not be discovered apart from special revelation .\nThe idea that God was giving the Israelites advanced scientific revelation\u2014the inside scoop on water locked up at the furthest extremes of the cosmos\u2014simply does not comport with the teaching purposes of the Genesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not sustain its supposition that the term raqiya \u2018 ( \u2018 expanse \u2019 ) retains a single rigid meaning throughout Genesis 1 .\nAs mentioned , a key assertion of Humphreys , Faulkner , and Mortenson is that the \u2018 waters above \u2019 must be higher than the stars .\nBut the Bible nowhere says that the waters are above the stars .\nIt only says that they are above the raqiya \u2018 ( \u2018 expanse \u2019 ) that God made on Day 2 .\nThe idea that the waters are above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two factors .\nFirst , the sun , moon , and stars were set \u201c in the expanse ( raqiya \u2018 ) of the heavens \u201d on Day 4 ( Genesis 1:14\u201319 ) .\nSecond , it is argued that the term raqiya \u2018 retains a precise and fixed meaning throughout Genesis 1 , permitting no variation between its occurrences on Days 2 , 4 , and 5.10 But if raqiya \u2018 has only one meaning throughout Genesis 1 , this leads to a problem .\nOn Day 5 , God created winged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the expanse ( raqiya \u2018 ) of the heavens \u201d ( Genesis 1:20 ) .\nMore literally , the Hebrew says that the birds fly \u201c on the face of the expanse of the heavens \u201d .\nBoth Humphreys and Mortenson think this detail weighs in favour of their interpretation .\nAgainst those who would equate the expanse with the atmosphere , they point out that the birds are not said to be in the expanse , rather they are \u2018 al pene , \u201c on the face \u201d of it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn \u2019 t have \u2018 in the open expanse \u2019 .\nIt doesn \u2019 t even have the preposition \u2018 in \u2019 .\nInstead it uses another preposition , \u05dc\u05b7\u05e2 ( \u2018 al ) , which means \u2018 on , over , above \u2019 , but not \u2018 in \u2019 .\n\u201d 11 Mortenson similarly says , \u201c The preposition al never means \u2018 in \u2019 .\n\u201d 12 Humphreys and Mortenson are correct that \u2018 al does not mean \u2018 in \u2019 .\nBut they do not appreciate the significance of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds in Genesis 1:20 , and thus the meaning of raqiya \u2018 in the context of Day 5 .\nOddly , after emphasizing the fact that the birds are not said to be in the expanse nor in its face , they place them there anyway .\nAccording to Mortenson , \u201c the raqiya \u2018 extends from the water on the surface of the earth to the waters above \u201d , which he locates at the edge of the universe .\nBut the \u201c face of the expanse \u201d , he claims , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perimeter or veneer of the raqiya \u2018 [ which ] we call today \u2018 the atmosphere \u2019 \u201d ( figure 2 ) .13 Humphreys agrees , claiming : Is this really what the author of Genesis intended to convey , that the birds fly inside of the expanse \u2019 s face , which is a region of considerable thickness ( at least 25,000 feet ) \u2014only thin by comparison to higher heavens ?\nNot at all .\nThis interpretation fails for three reasons .\nIt is doubtful that a \u2018 face \u2019 refers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a surface .\nFirst , the biblical evidence does not support the idea that a \u2018 face \u2019 describes an outer layer that itself contains some depth .\nIn the Old Testament , the Hebrew term \u201c face \u201d ( panim ) often refers to a face belonging to a human , another creature , or God .\nBut when referring to objects , it refers to a surface , facing side , facade , border , or edge .\nFrequently it refers to the surface of the earth or sea .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible surface of the full moon ( Job 26:9 ) , the sharp edge\u2014or perhaps flat side\u2014of an ax head ( Ecclesiastes 10:10 ) , the east side of the Jordan River ( 1 Kings 17:3 ) , the flat top of a column ( 2 Chronicles 4:13 ) , the front surface of the mercy seat ( Leviticus 16:14 ) , the facade of the temple ( 2 Chronicles 3:17 ) , the eastern border of Egypt ( 1 Samuel 15:7 ) , and the visual appearance of the city of Sodom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn all cases , the \u2018 face \u2019 would include the contours , if any , of the surface , but does not extend beneath the surface to refer to the outermost layer of an object .\nFor example , the face of an apple would refer to an exterior side visible to an observer , not to the apple \u2019 s skin .\nSome might allege that Job 41:13 provides a counterexample .\nThe verse asks , regarding Leviathan , \u201c Who can strip off the face of his garment ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously refers metaphorically to the creature \u2019 s impenetrable scales .\nBut even here the face need not be identical with Leviathan \u2019 s \u2018 layer \u2019 of scaly skin .\nThe face could merely be the outer hard surface of his scaly skin .\nSo there are no clear biblical examples where an object \u2019 s \u2018 face \u2019 is a layer of any depth , let alone one that is 25,000 feet thick .\nMortenson claims that Scripture \u2019 s references to \u201c the face of the earth \u201d have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He says the phrase refers to a \u201c perimeter or layer or veneer of the earth \u201d which is still \u201c very thin compared to the radius of the earth \u201d .13 But he does not offer any exegesis to demonstrate that this is what the phrase means .\nHe appears to believe it because he says the face is \u201c where people , plants , and animals live ( even those that live in the ground or deep in the oceans ) \u201d .13 But an examination of texts that speak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth \u201d ( or land , ground , field , etc . )\nshows they typically describe land animals , not sea creatures .\nFish are usually said to be \u201c in the water under the earth \u201d rather than on its face ( Exodus 20:4 ; Deuteronomy 4:18 ; 5:8 ) .\nOne possible exception is Zephaniah 1:2\u20133 , which seems to use a broader definition of \u2018 earth \u2019 that includes the regions of the sea as well as the dry land .\nBut even if \u201c the face of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this passage , this would still be consistent with the \u2018 face \u2019 referring only to the surface of the ground , not a layer of earth and seawater .\nThe biblical writers knew that land extended beneath the sea ( Job 38:16 ; Psalm 18:15 ; Jonah 2:5\u20136 ; Nahum 1:4 ) , so fish \u201c on the face of the earth \u201d would mean those above the seafloor .\nAs for the burrowing creatures , they are implicitly included among the group described in Genesis 7:23 , for example , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of the ground \u201d .\nBut if the face is a layer that encompasses their burrows , why aren \u2019 t these creatures said to be in the face of the ground rather than on it ?\nBurrowers are grouped with those on the earth \u2019 s face because , first , burrowers spend some time above ground and , second , the text is making a generalization about the location of land-dwelling animals , not intending to pedantically describe every exceptional case .\nThis is similar to the way God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food \u201d ( Genesis 1:30 ) without meaning to exclude plants of other colours .\nIn sum , no passages clearly portray an object \u2019 s \u2018 face \u2019 as a layer , so the proponents of the cosmic shell view have no sound basis for treating \u201c the face of the expanse \u201d in this way .\nThe original audience would not have considered the atmosphere to be a \u2018 thin \u2019 veneer .\nEven if the term \u2018 face \u2019 could be used to describe a layer of some thickness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell them that stars were vastly more distant than the heights achieved by birds and clouds , and the evidence we have suggests they did not think of the heavens in this way .\nIn the Bible , clouds are frequently featured\u2014more often than stars\u2014as examples of extreme heights ( Job 20:6 ; 22:12\u201314 ; 35:5 ; Psalm 36:5 ; 104:13 ; 108:4 ; Isaiah 14:14 ; Ezekiel 31:3 , 10 , 14 ) .\nThis is not to say that the Bible commits any error here , as no claim is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scripture is silent about precisely how distant heavenly objects are .\nBut it would be anachronistic to insist that the biblical author conceived of the starry heavens as so incredibly vast that , by comparison , the atmospheric region was merely a thin veneer .\nHere again , the cosmic shell view presumes that the Bible discloses advanced scientific insights\u2014this time about the vastness of space .\nBut there is no good reason to believe that the Israelites had this understanding .\nThus , equating \u201c the face of the expanse \u201d with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made no sense to them , so they must have understood the face to mean something else .\nBirds are in front of the \u2018 face \u2019 , not inside it .\nEven if the expanse \u2019 s face were a layer 25,000-feet thick , and even if the Israelites thought that the face was merely a veneer compared to the rest of the heavens , it would still be problematic to locate the birds inside the face of the expanse , because the expression \u2018 al pene in Genesis 1:20 demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , not within it .\nOther uses of the phrase show that it refers to a position of being on , above , or in front of something .\nIn Genesis 1:2 , for example , \u201c the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.\n\u201d In Genesis 6:1 , \u201c man began to multiply on the face of the land.\n\u201d In Genesis 19:28 , Abraham \u201c looked down toward [ literally , on the face of ] Sodom and Gomorrah \u201d .\nIn all such cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the face are never positioned wholly inside it .\nThey are outside of the face , either in contact with the surface , or situated opposite to it .\nThere are a few instances where objects partly penetrate a surface and are still described as \u201c on the face \u201d , but these are not exceptions to the rule .\nFor example , Genesis 1:29 says that plants were \u201c on the face of all the earth \u201d , though their roots extended below the surface of the ground .\nLikewise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ark \u201c floated on the face of the waters \u201d even though some portion of it was submerged .\nIn these instances , the idea is not that the objects were suspended within the face of the earth or the waters , because this would be inconsistent with the use of \u2018 al pene elsewhere .\nRather , the expression means that the visible portion of these objects rose up from the surface .\nIt \u2019 s only because they extended above the surface that they could be said to be \u201c on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Scripture \u2019 s use of the phrase elsewhere , the birds which are \u2018 al pene in Genesis 1:20 must be outside ( or at least extend outside ) the face of the expanse .\nHumphreys and Mortenson place them entirely inside , so they can not be correct .\nFaulkner is too vague on this point to critique .\nThe solution is to abandon the supposition that the \u2018 expanse \u2019 must mean exactly the same thing throughout Genesis 1 .\nThe idea that the term \u2018 expanse \u2019 can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since the expanse is coextensive with the \u2018 heavens \u2019 ( shamayim ) \u2014a term which is demonstrably flexible .\nMortenson acknowledges this , calling shamayim an \u201c imprecise word \u201d which can refer to different aspects of the sky in different contexts.15 For example , wind can blow \u201c in the heavens \u201d ( Psalm 78:26 ) , referring to the area where birds fly , yet the clouds can also \u201c cover the heavens \u201d ( Psalm 147:8 ) , meaning they block from view the portion of the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shamayim can even switch meanings within a few verses , without warning .\nFor instance , Genesis 6:7 calls birds creatures \u201c of heaven \u201d , but Genesis 6:17 classifies them as creatures \u201c under heaven \u201d .\nBirds can be described in both ways because the term \u2018 heaven \u2019 conveys different concepts in the two instances .\nHumphreys even admits that there are multiple \u2018 heavens \u2019 in Genesis 1 .\nHe says : If so , there is no need to presume that the phrase \u201c expanse of the heavens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavens .\nIn the case of Genesis 1:20 ( Day 5 ) , the most natural way to understand the phrase , \u201c the face of the expanse of the heavens \u201d , is as a phenomenological description .\nThis is because , as shown above , the face must be a facing side or a surface rather than a layer , and the birds are located on the near side of this face .\nThe sky doesn \u2019 t literally have a \u2018 surface \u2019 , but , using the language of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sky \u2019 s opaque features apparent to a viewer as its \u2018 face \u2019 ( presenting side ) .\nSo \u201c the face of the expanse \u201d refers to the appearance of the sky above as a background , just like the \u2018 face \u2019 of Sodom that Abraham saw refers to its presenting side from his vantage point .\nThe birds can fly \u2018 al\u2014that is , in front of\u2014this face without being in it because the face of the expanse is the visible backdrop , not the three-dimensional atmosphere.17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the true meaning of the phrase \u2018 al pene as it is used throughout Scripture .\nThis precludes the expanse of Day 5 from being identical to the expanse of Day 2 .\nThe Day 2 expanse extends from the waters above down to the surface of what became the sea , so it must include the invisible airy space where birds fly.18 But on Day 5 , the expanse clearly does not include the space where birds fly .\nThe birds are outside of and in front of this expanse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is behind them.19 Once the expanse is acknowledged to have more than one meaning in Genesis 1 , it can no longer be assumed that the waters above the expanse of Day 2 must also be above the expanse of Day 4 .\nOn Day 2 , the upper waters could be clouds above the spacious region where birds fly\u2014appropriately labelled \u201c Heaven \u201d ( Genesis 1:8 ) .\nBut the Day 4 expanse could refer to the more distant part of the sky that appears to be blue during the day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different perhaps to the Day 5 expanse .\nThis variation in the meaning of the term \u2018 expanse \u2019 is demanded by a careful investigation of its contextual usage , and such variation undermines any requirement that the \u2018 waters above \u2019 be higher than the stars .\nThe cosmic shell view makes the \u2018 deep \u2019 of Genesis 1:2 so vast that it threatens to undermine the contextual meaning of the terms \u2018 earth \u2019 and \u2018 deep \u2019 .\nBefore the waters were separated on Day 2 , they were previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when they were called \u201c the deep \u201d ( Genesis 1:2 ) .\nOutside of Genesis 1 , the \u2018 deep \u2019 ( tehom ) typically refers to seas as well as subterranean waters that can rise to the earth \u2019 s surface through springs .\nAnother term that serves a similar purpose is \u2018 depths \u2019 ( metsolah ) , which is most commonly used to refer to deep seas .\nThe \u2018 deep \u2019 and plural \u2018 deeps \u2019 or \u2018 depths \u2019 are always treated as components of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined broadly to encompass all regions under heaven , as opposed to mere dry land .\nFor example , Psalm 148:7 says , \u201c Praise the Lord from the earth , you great sea creatures and all deeps \u201d .\nThe deeps belong to the realm of Earth .\nWas this also true of the deep when it was first created ?\nYes .\nIn Genesis 1 , the deep is clearly associated with the \u2018 earth \u2019 made on the first day .\nThis is implied by two important exegetical considerations .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ summary of the creation account or an \u201c introductory encapsulation \u201d as Faulkner asserts.20 It is the first creative act of Day 1 .\nThere are several strong reasons to regard it as the initial event , including the fact that in Hebrew there is a waw-conjunctive ( translated \u201c And \u201d or \u201c Now \u201d ) connecting verses 1 and 2 .\nThis is sandwiched between \u201c the earth \u201d at the end of verse 1 and the same term at the beginning of verse 2 .\nSuch a construction indicates that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state of the earth just mentioned , which involves an unfinished earth , not a completed one .\nThus , verse 2 is not a description of conditions prior to any of the narrative \u2019 s events , but the state of affairs that resulted from verse 1.21 Also , Genesis 1 uses the classic formula for opening Hebrew narratives .\nIt has a temporal clause ( \u201c In the beginning \u201d ) followed by a perfect verb ( \u201c created \u201d ) in verse 1 , which regularly depicts the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pattern comes a series of waw-consecutives ( \u201c and \u201d prefixed to imperfect verbs ) .\nThese describe subsequent events , exactly as found in Genesis 1 ( \u201c And said \u2026 And was \u2026 And saw \u2026 And separated \u2026 \u201d ) .22,23 Furthermore , if verse 1 were an encapsulation of the whole week , then the earth and the deep would already have been present prior to the beginning of the account , without any explanation as to how they came to be .\nIronically , if this were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually describe the ultimate origin of the earth despite the claim of the encapsulation .\nNo , the text means to say that God \u2019 s first act to kick off Day 1 was to create the regions of heaven and earth.24 The second consideration is that the phrase \u201c the heavens and the earth \u201d in Genesis 1:1 is a merism\u2014combining two opposite extremes to refer to a whole .\nThe phrase refers to the realms that comprise the entire ( though as yet undeveloped ) universe .\nIt is not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constituent parts are retained in the meaning.23 That is , the distinct regions of heaven and earth came into being with this first act of creation on Day 1 , and they constitute the totality of physical realms .\nAlso , because the context is about the first act of ex nihilo creation , here the expression would necessarily be inclusive of whatever contents these realms initially contained , such as the primordial waters discussed in the next verse.25 Verse 2 then comments on the state of the earth after its creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 deep \u2019 .\nSince God \u2019 s creation of \u201c the heavens and the earth \u201d was the first creative act , and since these realms comprise the whole of creation , the deep must belong to one of them .\nBecause verse 2 narrows the focus to the earth by itself , the deep in context belongs to the earth , not the heavens .\nTherefore , the term \u2018 earth \u2019 in Genesis 1:1\u20132 does not refer merely to hard ground , but implicitly includes the waters of the deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deep was created as a fixture of the earth .\nThe problem that then arises for the cosmic shell perspective is that this theory requires the deep to be so enormous that it becomes hard to see how it can be either part of or synonymous with the primitive earth .\nConsider how much water the cosmic shell view supposes was in the deep .\nThe deep consisted of all of the \u2018 waters above \u2019 and all of the \u2018 waters below \u2019 prior to their separation .\nIf the \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-dimensional universe\u2014even as widely scattered ice fragments or liquid droplets\u2014they must represent an enormous amount of mass .\nExactly how much space would the waters have occupied when they were originally combined on Day 1 ?\nFaulkner and Mortenson do not offer any specific estimates of the amount of material contained in the waters above or in the original deep .\nMortenson cautions , \u201c We have no biblical basis to say how much water is above the heaven or how thick that watery boundary is.\n\u201d 13 But we do know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a thin , sparse cosmic shell would require a lot more water than is now present on the earth .\nAdmittedly , without specific numbers , Faulkner and Mortenson might be hard to pin down on this point .\nBut Humphreys has speculated about the size of the initial deep , and his figures illustrate the difficulty .\nHumphreys \u2019 book , Starlight and Time , suggested the initial deep might have been a sphere \u201c greater than 2 light-years in diameter \u201d .26 In recent presentations , he has increased this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure of 2 light-years is mind-bogglingly huge .\nThe diameter of today \u2019 s solar system , using the orbit of Pluto as its boundary , is merely 10 light-hours .\nHumphreys does not try to claim that this enormous ball of water should be thought of as the early earth .\nNo , he says , \u201c The earth at this point is merely a formless , undefined region of water at the center of the deep , empty of inhabitant or feature.\n\u201d 26 His presentations make it clear that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this material ( figure 4 ) .\nPlanet Earth today has a diameter of about 1.35 x 10-9 light-years\u2014more than a billion times smaller than Humphreys \u2019 watery deep .\nGiven Humphreys \u2019 view that the earth was tiny compared to the waters\u2014absolutely dwarfed by an incomprehensibly large deep\u2014it makes little sense to think of the deep as part of the primitive earth .\nThe Bible presents the deep as a component of the earth , but Humphreys presents it as a collection of waters so vast that the earth virtually disappears inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct , Genesis 1:1 should have said that God created the heavens and the deep , not the heavens and the earth .\nI have not been able to ascertain Mortenson \u2019 s stance on the relationship between the primitive earth and the deep , but Faulkner takes a different view than Humphreys .\nHe maintains that \u201c the earth created at the beginning of Day One was a water mass \u201d , which he equates with the deep.10 So , unlike Humphreys , Faulkner correctly believes that the primitive earth contained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humphreys in thinking that the deep originally took up dramatically more space than planet Earth occupies today , problems remain .\nWhereas Humphreys faces a challenge with the biblical conception of the \u2018 deep \u2019 , Faulkner faces a challenge with the biblical conception of the \u2018 earth \u2019 .\nFor example , consider a scenario in which Faulkner \u2019 s water mass started off comparable in size to Humphreys \u2019 ball , 2 light-years in diameter .\nIn this case , it would not seem reasonable for Genesis 1:2 to describe this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBeing composed of water is not the problem , as Faulkner reasonably argues that the term \u2018 earth \u2019 can refer to \u201c primordial matter that would become the earth as we know it now.\n\u201d 10 Yet , with a water mass of this size , the vast majority of it would not have served as raw materials which God transformed into our terrestrial planet .\nThe bulk would instead have been swept to the edge of the cosmos .\nFaulkner \u2019 s so-called \u2018 earth \u2019 would have been composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosmic shell \u2019 and hardly any \u2018 earth \u2019 at all .\nIt might be argued that one could rescue both Humphreys \u2019 and Faulkner \u2019 s models from the above criticisms by postulating a cosmic shell which is dramatically less thick or less dense than Humphreys has supposed , so that far less water would be required in the original deep .\nHowever , it is not clear that any specific amount of water will alleviate the difficulty .\nFor one thing , the universe could easily turn out to be much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum size , exacerbating the problem .\nBut even assuming a universe no larger than we can measure today , it may not be possible to find that \u2018 just right \u2019 amount of water which is great enough to form a shell yet still minimal enough to fit on the earth .\nIn my judgment , even a spherical water mass which was merely double our planet \u2019 s diameter is already too large to be faithful to the biblical terms \u2018 earth \u2019 or \u2018 deep \u2019 .\nYet if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounds the universe , it could only form a hopelessly meagre shell which would seem too insubstantial to be worthy of the description , \u201c waters \u2026 above the expanse \u201d ( Genesis 1:7 ) .\nIf these assessments are correct , then no carefully chosen amount of water will allow the cosmic shell view to overcome this objection .\nAlthough the cosmic shell view of the \u2018 waters above \u2019 attempts to faithfully interpret the events of Day 2 of Creation Week , the problems highlighted here reveal that this proposal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 .\nHopefully , this contribution will encourage those who currently hold to the cosmic shell perspective to revise or abandon it

around the time of Christ \u2019 s birth .\nIt speaks of messianic hopes , and so is important for understanding the sort of messianic hopes among Jews around the time of Jesus .\nHowever , does the New Testament plagiarize its notion of Jesus \u2019 resurrection on the third day from the Gabriel Revelation ?\nMy name is A. from Kerala , southern India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gabriel revelation stele

days and 3 nightsplagiarised from this stone information as it pre-dates before the birth of Jesus Christ .\nAndlater on Jesus adopted this idea in His case .\nHe went on further to say that Essenes a Jewish sect was the first and only group to come upwith the idea of 3 days and 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 3 nights anddays nowhere found in the Old Testament and no Jews had such notions about the Messiahexcept Essenes .\nWhen a rebel named shimon who thought himself to be Messiah , was killed by roman forceand their closed companions were informed by angel Gabriel that Shimon would beresurrected in 3 days and nights and possibly , they may have penned that message down ingrey lime stone now known as Gabriel revelation stone , and Jesus copied that idea fromEssenes cult .\nThanks for writing in .\nFirst , so what ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn \u2019 t really affect the evidence for Jesus \u2019 resurrection .\nThe evidence for Jesus \u2019 death , the empty tomb , the resurrection appearances , and the rise of the early church as a result is all still solid and true .\nAnd there is no better explanation of this data than Jesus \u2019 resurrection .\nSo , if line 80 of the Gabriel Revelation really read \u201c On the third day , live , I Gabriel command you \u201d , the most this would mean is that we should stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprecedented expectation in Early Judaism .\nHowever , the Gospels themselves implicitly warn us against overstating this notion , since Herod Antipas ( Matthew 14:1\u20132 ) and others ( Luke 9:7 ) seemed willing to think of Jesus as John the Baptist resurrected .\nHowever , does the Gabriel Revelation evince a broad expectation of a Messiah rising from the dead before the general resurrection ?\nNo .\nAt best , it \u2019 s one example expecting it .\nThis doesn \u2019 t reflect any general trends in the Jewish literature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is evidence against the notion that any such expectation was widespread .\nIf the Jews were widely expecting a Messiah who would die and rise again before the general resurrection , then where \u2019 s the literature supporting it ?\nThe relevant literature ( including the New Testament : John 12:34 ) shows that the dominant tradition in Judaism in Jesus \u2019 day was that the Messiah would live forever without dying .\nThat said , the Old Testament by itself provides fertile grounds for an enterprising Jewish interpreter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a dying and rising Messiah .\nIndeed , to deny this would be to deny that Jesus \u201c was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures \u201d ( 1 Corinthians 15:4 ) .\nFor instance , a biblical motif of \u2018 raising up on the third day \u2019 can be traced to Hosea 6:2 : \u201c After two days he will revive us ; on the third day he will raise us up , that we may live before him.\n\u201d In the context of Hosea 6 , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who treat God \u2019 s justice lightly , and God goes on in Hosea 6:4ff to excoriate them for their presumption .\nHowever , one could easily see it applied more literally to a righteous sufferer as an expectation of speedy vindication .\nWhere a sinful Israel/Judah can \u2019 t presume this , God \u2019 s righteous servant can .\nSo , while God wouldn \u2019 t raise up a sinful Israel \u2018 on the third day \u2019 , He would raise up His sinless Son \u2018 on the third day \u2019 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ righteous servant who suffers for the sins of his people ( Isaiah 53 ) , and it \u2019 s not hard to see how someone could conclude that the \u2018 righteous servant \u2019 of Isaiah 53 would be \u2018 raised up \u2019 on the third day .\nAnother way would be to see the righteous sufferer of Isaiah 53 vindicated in a typological replay of the prophet Jonah \u2019 s deliverance from death in the belly of the fish \u2018 for three days and nights \u2019 .\nIndeed , someone did combine these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising Messiah : Jesus himself ( Matthew 12:40 regarding Jonah , and Luke 22:37 regarding Isaiah 53 ) .\nIndeed , there is a broader \u2018 third day/three days \u2019 motif in Scripture , which is a formulaic timeframe in many different contexts .\nOf all the \u2018 nth day/n days \u2019 references in the OT ( up to \u2018 50th day/50 days \u2019 ) , the \u2018 third day/three days \u2019 pattern is the second most common ( 80 uses ) , after the \u2018 seventh day/seven days \u2019 pattern ( 137 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day/one day \u2019 pattern ( 59 uses ) ( figure 2 ) .\nAt any rate , does the Gabriel Revelation even evince a \u2018 resurrection on the third day \u2019 expectation ?\nUnlikely .\nThe consensus reading of the crucial line 80 has shifted since it was first published .\nThe first scholarly translation of the crucial line 80 was , \u201c In three days , live , I , Gabriel , command you.\n\u201d 1 However , this interpretation is no longer accepted , even by the scholar who first proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that

no learning : this basic rule now seems to have been validated in all kinds of organisms\u2014including young children.\n\u201d So says leading French cognitive neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene in his intriguing new book , How We Learn : The New Science of Education and the Brain.1 In other words , someone learns when you introduce something that is new , different , unexpected .\nWhen I say that 1 + 1 = 2 , you \u2019 ll have learned nothing .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 = 5 , you will learn that my arithmetic is hopeless , and you will question my education !\nLearning has many benefits .\nSchooling can take place in various contexts , and at an early age it contributes to better outcomes years later .\nThese improvements are in many areas\u2014 \u201d from lower crime rates to higher IQs and incomes to better health \u201d , says Dehaene ( p. 141 of his book ) .\nHowever , learning starts at an even earlier age than some might think .\nDid you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , babies can tell the difference between most vowels and consonants in every language in the world \u201d ?\n( p. 65 ) .\nIn addition to this , \u201c babies already prefer listening to their native language rather than to a foreign one\u2014a truly extraordinary finding which implies that language learning starts in utero [ in the womb ] \u201d ( p. 64 ) .\nIn fact , rather than starting off as a tabula rasa ( blank slate ) , a baby \u2019 s brain is ready to investigate and interact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true Sherlock Holmes in diapers \u201d ( p. 61 ) .\nReading bedtime stories to children every evening strengthens their brain circuits for language and enables them at a later age \u201c to understand texts and formulate complex thoughts \u201d ( p. 142 ) .\nAs a father of a 2-year-old daughter , I certainly resonate with this .\nAlso , while learning another language as an adult is by no means easy , for young children it is automatic , provided they are spoken to .\nThe ability to master sounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 12 months compared to just a few months .\nLong-term fluency in an extra language also requires that the child be in situations where she must use that language to communicate , the earlier the better\u2014and continue through puberty otherwise it is readily forgotten .\nThe \u2018 window \u2019 for grammar learning starts closing around puberty .\nImmigrants to a different-language country , if under four years old on arrival , end up with a barely detectable accent in that country \u2019 s language .\nBut the likelihood of an accent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massively if they migrated during adolescence or later ( pp .\n107\u2013108 ) .\nFurther , being raised in a bilingual context gives people \u201c better abilities for language processing and for acquiring a third or fourth language \u201d ( p. 142 ) .\nDehaene also notes that \u201c a child \u2019 s vocabulary at three to four years old directly depends on the amount of child-directed speech they received during their first years .\nPassive exposure does not suffice : active one-to-one interactions are essential \u201d ( p. 142 ) .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like \u2018 children should be seen , not heard \u2019 can be applied so as to discourage such interaction\u2014even in Christian circles .\nOur daughter carefully studies our mouths as she says , \u201c Again !\n\u201d when we sing to her or recite Scripture .\nHow did it come about , that children right at birth are equipped for language\u2014any language in fact ?\nApparently , or so Stanislas Dehaene claims , \u201c the nascent brain already possesses considerable knowledge inherited from its long evolutionary history \u201d ( p. 53 ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the heirs of an unfathomable wisdom .\nThrough Darwinian trial and error , our genome has internalized the knowledge of the generations that have preceded us \u201d ( p. 25 ) .\nIt is remarkable how evolution gets credit for many things .\nHowever , knowledge ( i.e .\ninformation ) is not a tangible thing , a property of matter .\nEven though information is stored on matter , it is a non-material entity , and all observations confirm that it only ever originates from an intelligent source .\nIs evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information for future purposes ?\nDoes it have foresight ?\nClearly not , as evolutionists themselves often insist .\nDehaene further says this applies to more than just language : \u201c parity , negative numbers , fractions \u2026 all these concepts are demonstrably grounded in the representation of quantities that we inherit from evolution \u201d ( p. 131 ) .\nWhile acknowledging Dehaene \u2019 s standing in the field of human cognition , this sort of evolutionary handwaving is unworthy of such an accomplished scientist .\nConsider that at the moment of conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis means that this \u201c considerable knowledge \u201d ( e.g .\nthe ability to quickly learn language ) is already in the nascent ( i.e .\nembryonic , or incipient ) human brain , and is somehow transferred there via the genome ( the DNA information inherited from the parents ) .\nIt is reasonable to believe that the omniscient Creator wisely programmed the information for this ability into the first human couple , ready to be passed on via the genome to all their descendants .\nEvolutionists , however , believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of genetic accidents , filtered by natural selection .\nThe father of modern linguistics , Noam Chomsky\u2014a self-professed atheist/agnostic\u2014said that the process by which the human mind achieved its present state of

such in glowing terms by the scientific media .\nThe implication of these challenges is clear ; biblical creationist interpretations of the Bible have been , and are continually being , proven wrong

these examples were trumpeted by the secular world\u2014and by many compromising Christians\u2014as legitimate reasons to reject a plain reading of the biblical account .\nIt took time and effort by

anglerfish", "content": "The anglerfish is a strange creature that comes in many varieties .\nHowever , there are some anglerfish that pose an interesting question from a biblical worldview .\nFish are nephesh chayyah , and as such these specific varieties of anglerfish can not be addressed in the same way that we address the death of insects and plants in relation to the Fall .\nUnlike insects or plants , fish are not biological robots .\nThe examples of concern are some species of ceratioid anglerfish .\nCeratioid anglerfish express extreme sexual dimorphism .\nSexual dimorphism means there are physical differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just their reproductive organs .\nAnimals that exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism are often drastically different in size and appearance .\nSome of them are so different that you would never know they were the same species just by looking at them .\nAnglerfish are bony fish belonging to the order Lophiiformes .\nMost people think of the anglerfish as a ghastly creature that has numerous long , pointy teeth , cold eyes , and a light that is released by the lure that hangs on its head .\nThis light is used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is produced by bioluminescent bacteria that live in the flesh bulb ) .\nWhile there are many varieties of anglerfish that drastically differ in appearance and environment , they all have a lure of some kind that they use to attract prey .\nAnglerfish in the suborder Ceratioidei live in the ocean depths , under enormous pressure and little or no light .\nMale ceratioid anglerfish are much smaller than the females , lack the glowing bulb they are named after and have much smaller teeth .\nTheir appearance is like a tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in darkness and use their highly developed sense of smell or sight ( depending on the species ) to track down females in the complete darkness of their deep-sea environment .\nOnce the male finds a female , he quickly latches onto her with his teeth to start a process that sounds like the stuff of science fiction .\nThe male begins to fuse his body to the female , and his body enlarges like a deformed tumour .\nAs it grows , it begins to lose limbs and organs .\nIts fins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function , and it ceases to have its own circulatory system .\nThe blood that carries oxygen through its body comes from the female .\nNow the creature exists as nothing but a sperm bank for the female .\nAt this point , the male seems to be just an extension of the female \u2019 s body .\nThe males have little decision in this matter , as they can only live for a few months without attaching to a female .\nThe males are too weak and underdeveloped to feed themselves after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are born , they seek out a mate ; failure brings death by starvation or predation .\nThere are about 25 species of ceratioid anglerfish that have some variation of this unique mating process.1 This is a rather dark mating process , that can cause some people to question the goodness of a God who would force creatures to endure such a harsh life .\nWe must remember that God created the world very good , and without death ( of nephesh chayyah ) .\nAdam corrupted the world when he betrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the world .\nAfter the Fall , animals began to behave violently , engaging in carnivory , cannibalism , and general violence .\nMutations ( copying errors in DNA ) began to accumulate , and these defects altered the way animals lived .\nWith this in mind , let \u2019 s re-examine the anglerfish .\nMany varieties of anglerfish do not reproduce in this manner .\nInstead , after latching onto the female with their teeth ; they release their sperm ( fertilizing the eggs ) , detach , and swim away.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the female is not universal and only exists among some members of the ceratoid anglerfish3 .\nMany anglerfish varieties do not express this extreme sexual dimorphism , and their appearance fits their name .\nSome researchers have argued that in some species , whether the males fuse to a female \u2019 s body is dependent on how sexually mature the female is .\nIf she is fully matured , then the immune system is also properly developed , and the fusion doesn \u2019 t occur.4 All of this paints a pre-Fall picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detached .\nBut after the Fall , some descendants of the original anglerfish suffered from degenerative mutations that caused their bodies to begin fusing while mating .\nWhile studies on living anglerfish are limited ( as it is very difficult to keep them alive in artificial environments ) scientists have postulated specific mutations that would make this process very simple .\nThe researchers propose that a series of mutations disabled the immune system .\nAntibodies no longer mature and create receptors for T-cells .\nAs a result of this , when the male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digestive enzymes that break down the tissue of both the male \u2019 s mouth and the female \u2019 s skin .\nThe damaged tissues begin to repair themselves ; but the bodies of the male and female do not recognize that they are separate , and this healing process fuses them .\nThis genetic deterioration or \u201c de-volution \u201d provided survival advantages in the harsh deep-sea environment , but it created a miserable life for the crippled males .\nThis aids survival because these specific varieties of anglerfish live in a large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anglerfish are isolated , and rarely see other members of the species .\nThis makes it hard for a male and female to find each other when they are ready to spawn .\nIf the male has fused to the female , he is there and ready to breed with her whenever she is ready to spawn .\nThis makes reproduction easier to accomplish in this environment .\nMany have described this as evolution removing key functions of the organism \u2019 s immune system , but to call this \u2018 evolution \u2019 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires the development of new features and structures .\nFor evolution to be valid , it must create the immune system , not erase key parts of it in a way that happens to be useful .\nAdaptation through loss of function is the opposite of \u2018 microbes to man \u2019 evolution .\nThese kinds of genetic changes could never produce the numerous kinds of lifeforms across the earth , even if we grant billions of years for the mutations to occur , accumulate , and be fixed into the populations .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this is evidence of evolution and this adaptation is readily explained from a Biblical perspective .\nIt won \u2019 t stay this way While nature is \u201c red in tooth and claw \u201d this is not a result of unguided evolution operating over millions of years , or the design of a cruel God who created things with the intent that they would suffer and die .\nThese things are the product of human sin , severing our relationship with God .\nThe horrible things seen in nature , occur because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to decay .\nHowever , there is hope .\nGod has not abandoned his creation to wither away without him , but has offered us salvation , and has promised to create a new world that is free from the scars of sin .\n\u201c For as by a man came death , by a man , has come also the resurrection of the dead .\nFor as in Adam all die , so also in Christ shall all be made alive .\n\u2026 The last enemy to be

mt ) DNA from sediment samples collected in Denisova Cave , including 175 samples of \u2018 ancient hominin \u2019 ( Denisovan , Neanderthal , and modern human ) mtDNA , said to cover \u201c nearly all layers in all three chambers \u201d .1 According to the authors , Denisovan mtDNA was found earliest , said to be associated with stone tools of the Middle Palaeolithic , supposedly deposited about 250 to 170 thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neanderthal mtDNA said to first appear \u201c towards the end of this period.\n\u201d 2 Denisovans and Neanderthals are alleged to have occupied the site repeatedly , \u201c possibly until , or after , the onset of the Initial Upper Palaeolithic at least 45,000 years ago , when modern human mtDNA is first recorded in the sediments.\n\u201d 1 The authors could not rule out all three human subgroups having been present there during the same time period , referred to as the \u201c period of Initial Upper Palaeolithic production \u201d .\n3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Denisova Cave site , and so the traces of modern human mtDNA detected are said by Zavala et al .\nto be \u201c the first direct evidence of Homo sapiens \u2019 presence at the cave.\n\u201d 4 The mtDNA of modern humans was found in the \u201c same layers as the jewellery and pendants made from stone , bone , tooth and ivory \u201d .4 The detection of different Neanderthal lineages , and results reflecting possibly different Denisovan populations,3 make for a complex occupation history .\nAll members of same species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by me in 2019.5 Earlier genome studies have reported evidence that the Denisovans interbred with modern humans6 and Neanderthals.7 There is also evidence of Neanderthals interbreeding with modern humans.8 Hence , by the biological species concept that makes them all part of the same species .\nTechnically , they should all be classified as Homo sapiens .\nFrom a biblical view , they were all members of the created human kind , and hence descendants of Adam and Eve .\nIf the evolutionary assumptions and long ages are dropped , then a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and modern humans all belonged to populations that , to various degrees , interbred with each other .\nAlso , hybridization between subgroups within the same species ( e.g .\nbetween humans broadly categorized as Homo erectus , Homo heidelbergensis , Homo neanderthalensis , Denisovan , and Homo sapiens ) can give rise to appearances that are sometimes \u2018 blended \u2019 in general character , and at other times mosaic , which may explain some of the features observed in the fossil record of humans .\nThe Zavala et al .\nstudy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DNA , which can complicate matters .\nFor example , consider the Spanish fossil remains from the Sima de los Huesos ( SH ) site in Sierra de Atapuerca , Burgos , Northern Spain .\nThese remains are usually assigned to the species Homo heidelbergensis , as well as being referred to as middle Pleistocene hominins ( or hominids ) .\nAn almost complete mtDNA sequence of an SH specimen was reported in 2014 as \u201c closely related to the lineage leading to mitochondrial genomes of Denisovans \u201d .\n9 However , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specimens in 2016 , it was reported that the SH specimens \u201c were related to Neanderthals rather than to Denisovans \u201d , even though the mtDNA recovered from one of the specimens shared the earlier described relationship to Denisovan mtDNA.10 A simple explanation in the above case is that the Denisovan , Neanderthal , and SH Homo heidelbergensis remains all belonged to populations that were fully human , and , to various degrees , interbred with each other .\nIn general , the mtDNA results reported from the Denisova Cave present no issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHowever , evolutionists allege that there was an accumulation of a few metres of sediments in the chambers of the Denisova Cave , over hundreds of thousands of years , where the samples of mtDNA were collected .\nDenisova Cave is in the Altai mountains of Siberia , Russia ( figure 1 ) .\nMore specifically , it \u201c is situated in the low and middle mountains of the northwest Altai mountains in the upper Anui Basin.\n\u201d 11 The limestone cave is situated \u201c above the right bank of the Anui @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrows.\n\u201d 12 The entrance to the cave is about 28 m above the modern-day river level , with the river surface 662 m above sea level.13 There are three chambers ( Main , East , and South Chambers ) in the Denisova Cave , each containing deposits , as described by Jacobs et al .\n: On the \u201c complexity and spatial heterogeneity of the deposits \u201d in the three principal chambers , Morley et al .\ncommented that it revealed \u201c a stratigraphic sequence created by geological ( e.g .\nphysical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deformation ) , biological ( e.g .\nanimal activity ) , and anthropogenic ( e.g .\nstone artefact manufacture ) processes.\n\u201d 15 According to Zavala et al.\n, the three chambers of the Denisova Cave : There appear to have been difficulties in constructing a common timescale for the three chambers .\nThe South Chamber was excluded \u201c because of various stratigraphic complications \u201d , and according to Zavala et al .\n: From the above , it seems radiocarbon dating ( up to about 50 ka ) and optical dating ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to date the sediments and provide a timescale for the deposits .\nHowever , the radiocarbon dating method is known to have problems , flawed assumptions , and to be unreliable , as discussed by Snelling.17 It is also often rejected by evolutionists .\nFor example , in 2017 Homo naledi was \u2018 dated \u2019 to between 236 and 335 ka ( using USESR and U-Th ) .18 However , two Homo naledi bone fragments were radiocarbon dated to c. 33.0 ka and 35.5 ka , but the dates were conveniently rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that they interpreted \u201c these ages to relate to late calcite precipitation in the bones that may reflect a wet period in the cave.\n\u201d 19 This illustrates the ambiguity of dating methods .\nThe optical dating methods used in the Denisova Cave were quartz optically stimulated luminescence ( OSL ) and K-feldspar post-infrared infrared stimulated luminescence ( pIRIR ) .20 Jacobs et al .\nstated that \u201c Optical dating gives an estimate of the time since grains of minerals , such as quartz and K-feldspar , were last exposed to sunlight.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c ages of the older samples were determined solely from the K-feldspar pIRIR signal , owing to saturation of the quartz OSL signal.\n\u201d 20 According to geologist Tasman Walker , thermoluminescence dating and its related techniques , such as OSL and infrared stimulated luminescence ( IRSL : note that the pIRIR dating is a modified version of the IRSL dating21 ) , have many unknowns : The ages of the dates obtained for the Denisova Cave deposits , using evolutionary assumptions , are not accepted here .\nHence , there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of thousands of years as claimed .\nFrom a biblical perspective , the limestone cave would have been formed during the Flood .\nAt the tail end of the Flood , as the waters were receding , sediments would have been left in the cave.23,24 Also , towards the end of the post-Flood Ice Age , the Anui River possibly experienced episodes of flooding as the ice thawed in the mountains .\nBeing close to the river , at an elevation of ~28 m above the present-day river level , this could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there .\nIt would also have disrupted any human occupation of the site , perhaps explaining why it appears to have changed hands several times between different human subgroups .", "author": "", "url": "https://creation.com/a/16166", "published":

particularly remarkable is what makes so many people think they are remarkable .\nThey are seen as remarkable because many cosmologists expected these galaxies , and stars to look like hypothetical primitive stars and galaxies .\nInstead , they look much more mature , and more like the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of space that aren \u2019 t as far away from us .\nCMI has written about the James Webb Telescope before , and what those who believe in the big bang expect to see .\nSo , what does the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) show ?\nAccording to the big bang , the universe started much simpler , and slowly , over billions of years , modern stars and modern galaxies formed .\nThey have created models that predict what these early galaxies and stars should look like .\nBig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into space , they can reveal the ancient past of the universe .\nThe idea here is that since light travels at a certain speed , light coming from stars that are billions of lightyears away will be light that depicts what the stars , and galaxies looked like billions of years ago .\nSo , light from galaxies over 13.5 billion light years away , should show us what these portions of the universe looked like in this hypothetical past .\nBecause of this , they expect to see the \u2018 primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed in the early stages of the hypothetical big bang universe .\nThis is where they hit a brick wall .\nContrary to their predictions , we do not see these primordial structures .\nInstead , what they find are far more mature/modern looking stars and galaxies .\nThis suggests ( given their assumptions about the age of the universe ) that even 13.5 billion years ago , stars and galaxies were already very developed and mature .\nCosmic evolution requires billions of years of slow and gradual change to go from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have today , and what we observe from the telescope contradicts this .\nLight from the most distant cosmic structures shows they are mature and well formed .\nIt is almost as if they were created mature and did not slowly form over massive periods of time.2 This is consistent with God creating a complete , functional universe from the start , but does not fit with the idea of slow , gradual , cosmic evolution .\nWhen God made the creatures of the air and sea , he did not fill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the water .\nThe animals were full grown ,

a habit of sweeping problems under the rug , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark matter , dark energy , and superluminal inflation .\nThese fudge factors are used to wave away difficulties between what the Big Bang theory predicts , and what we actually observe .\nSome secular scientists take issue with this practice , but the average person won \u2019 t know those things are fudge factors .\nA fudge factor in this context refers to an ad hoc explanation or mechanism that is invoked to prop up what would otherwise be a failed theory .\nHere is an example of some of the fudge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Big Bang .\nAn excerpt from a previous article explains : \u201c First it was dark matter , then came dark energy , followed by dark fluid , dark flow , and dark radiation ; and now a new entity is suggested for the dark sector of particle physics\u2014dark photons .\nThe dark sector is full of hypothetical entities designed to save the big bang story but it is really just a lot of cosmic storytelling .\nPreviously I have argued that dark matter is a sort of \u2018 god of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 in astrophysics .\nIt is an unknown invoked to explain the inexplicable , which , if you follow the chain of logic , is required to maintain a belief in the big bang paradigm .\nIts existence is only inferred from the application of known physics to certain observations in the universe \u2026 Dark matter has never been observed in space or in any laboratory experiment.\n\u201d Since big bang theorists have previously either ignored the evidence or invented fudge factors to gloss over evidence that conflicts with the big bang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this new discovery .\nThe unscientific nature of cosmological models are such that even with a large amount of contrary data , the theory often goes largely unchallenged .\nThis may be the straw that breaks the camel \u2019 s back , but I won \u2019 t hold my breath .\nThis has already been happening as articles pop up defending the big bang .\nInstead of addressing the questions raised by the images , they simply change the subject .\nSome have done this by pointing to the lack of acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiation ( which is a problem for the big bang ) 3 , other secular scientists have tried to explain why their big bang predictions fail : \u201c Without the hypothetical inflation field , the big bang does not predict the smooth , isotropic cosmic background radiation that is observed , because there would be no way for parts of the universe that are now more than a few degrees away in the sky to come to the same temperature and thus emit the same amount of microwave radiation .\n\u2026 Inflation requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implied by big bang nucleosynthesis , the theory \u2019 s explanation of the origin of the light elements \u2026 In no other field of physics would this continual recourse to new hypothetical objects be accepted as a way of bridging the gap between theory and observation .\nIt would , at the least , raise serious questions about the validity of the underlying theory.\n\u201d We also need to keep in mind what would count as an acceptable alternative in the eyes of big bang cosmologists .\nThe big bang model is preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An alternative model could be proposed that explains the data far better , or even just as good , but it would be rejected due to philosophical preference .\nAn alternative will only be accepted if the model conforms to the bias of the community , and it does a better job of explaining observations than the big bang does , that or the

many other carnivorous and hoofed animals too , such as and cats and horses .\nThe shoulder bones appear somewhat disconnected from the rest of the skeleton and dogs don \u2019 t have the obvious collar bone ( clavicle ) that we humans have .\nThe tiny canine clavicle has a variety of sizes and shapes in adult dogs1 and some evolutionists have argued that it is rudimentary ; implying that it \u2019 s now a largely \u2018 useless leftover \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut claims of it being vestigial don \u2019 t stack up .\nTogether with other parts of the shoulder anatomy ( termed the \u2018 clavicular complex \u2019 ) , the clavicle plays an important role in canine locomotion .\nTo pre-empt the accusation that creationists misunderstand or misrepresent the evolutionary argument about vestiges , we \u2019 ll first mention a recent promulgation of this argument by University of Chicago professor Jerry Coyne in his Why Evolution is True : \u201c A trait can be vestigial and functional at the same time .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ s functionless , but because it no longer performs the function for which it evolved \u201d ( emphasis in original ) .2 However , this begs the question , for unless it can be empirically established that a trait is vestigial and shown to have once served a different role , the prior \u2018 function \u2019 is just a statement of faith .\nFor 150 years \u2018 vestigial organ \u2019 was defined in a manner similar to the following , from a popular 1998 biology text : \u201c Evolution is not a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain structures , others are retained , sometimes persisting even if they are not used .\nA structure that seems to have no function in one species , yet is homologous to a functional organ in another species , is termed vestigial .\nDarwin compared vestigial organs to silent letters in a word\u2014they are not pronounced , but they offer clues to the word \u2019 s origin.\n\u201d 3 Coyne \u2019 s revisionary definition indicates that he is aware that this traditional concept has proven to be indefensible .\nSo his definition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept seem to work again in the face of overwhelming evidence that truly vestigial organs ( useless leftovers of evolutionary history ) are very hard to find.4 Coyne does not engage at all with informed creationist writing on the subject and his \u2018 examples \u2019 of vestiges are dealt with on this site ( see the many articles linked here ) , for instance flightless birds , the eyes of cave-dwellers and whale \u2018 leg bones \u2019 ( here and here ) .\nHis claim for the vestigial human appendix ( now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in denial ( see here and here ) and is merely keeping evolutionary faith : \u201c \u2026our appendix is simply the remnant of an organ that was critically important to our leaf-eating ancestors , but of no real value to us.\n\u201d 5 His discussion indicates that he is entirely ignorant of its long-known immune function and , on the contrary , the Appendix shrieks \u2018 Creation \u2019 .\nHis other claims are also easily rebutted , the coccyx , erector pili muscles ( that cause goose bumps ) and the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWith any alleged revisionist vestige , Coyne and his fellow evolutionists must first demonstrate ( not merely assert ) what function the body part had previously .\nAnd since that function presumably aided the ancestral creature \u2019 s survival ( which is why the much-touted mutation and selection mechanism supposedly favoured its development in the first place ) , they must give substantive reasons why and how this function became unnecessary later on .\nMere just-so stories are not science so they do not count as explanations .\nAt the very least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenario about how a quite different body part evolved to gradually take over the vital function once performed by the now-vestigial body structure .\nInstead , Coyne \u2019 s own words give the game away : \u201c But even after we \u2019 ve established that a trait is vestigial , the questions don \u2019 t end .\nIn which ancestors was it functional ?\nWhat was it used for ?\nWhy did it lose its function ?\nWhy is it still there instead of having disappeared completely ?\n\u201d 2 This demonstrates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , without knowing the answers to such questions , it can not in any sense ( scientifically or otherwise ) be \u201c established that the trait we see now is vestigial \u201d by definition ( emphasis added ) !\nArguments for vestiges invariably turn out to be arguments from ignorance or they reveal faith in evolution in the teeth of contrary evidence .\nTherefore , regarding the canine clavicle we must peel away the rhetoric to find out what is known about its function .\nEvolutionists often mistakenly assume that the relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its absence ) is proof of a loss of a former function .\nNevertheless , in a paper devoted to this very bone and its related body parts the authors ( both veterinary scientists and evolutionists ) describe detailed and important functions.1 Their paper focuses on the clavicle of newborn puppies but is in agreement with the work of other veterinary scientists on adult dogs.6 During locomotion , the tiny clavicle and associated parts provide muscle stability and allow adjustment of the position of muscles involved in movements of the humerus ( upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the healthy articulation of the head of the humerus with the shoulder ; without it , normal movement of the foreleg ( towards the head or tail , or inwards , under the dog \u2019 s chest ) could not occur .\nFurthermore , these functions of the \u2018 clavicular complex \u2019 also protect blood vessels of the \u2018 armpit \u2019 and the brachial plexus ( a network of vascular tissue running from the neck into the leg ) from mechanical damage during movement .\nIn other words , far from offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed knowledge of the anatomy and function of the canine \u2018 clavicular complex \u2019 points strongly to its economy of design .\nUS dog expert Wayne Cavanaugh \u2019 s assessment of the canine clavicle agrees with mine.7 Some years after this CMI article was first published ( 2014 ) , Mr Cavanaugh stated the following : \u201c The reason that dogs don \u2019 t have actual collar bones is purely functional .\nDogs , like their ancestral wolves , are a \u2018 predatory cursorial \u2019 species ; that is , they are designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can cover large areas , find distant sources of food and water , chase down prey , or escape from predators and enemies .\nUnlike non-cursorial mammals\u2014for example , humans\u2014they don \u2019 t need to lift , push or pull objects to get food and they don \u2019 t need to rotate their arms every which way .\nThose kinds of functions require an entirely different system for attaching front assemblies to torsos\u2014including , you guessed it , collar bones .\nAs predatory cursorial animals , dogs need to excel in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a spine that can amazingly bend and stretch , and a powerful hindquarter to provide forward propulsion , dog \u2019 s shoulders are designed for balance and to increase the length of their stride .\nTo make this all happen , extreme flexibility is vital and fundamental \u201d ( emphases added ) .8 The construction of the dog \u2019 s \u2018 floating shoulder \u2019 improves running efficiency , allowing a much greater stride length and higher running speed than would otherwise be possible .\nOf course , pet owners who have spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaces are very familiar with their impressive speed , agility and leaping ability\u2014absolutely no evidence for inferior design here !\nOn the contrary , these superlative design features reflect the peerless wisdom and ingenuity of the Creator of the canine kind ( Genesis 1:24\u201325 ) .\nNot vestigial in any way but \u201c very good

unique and fantastic qualities , almost all of them have something in common : a cold and lethal reproductive cycle .\nThe argonaut is a unique variety of octopus with the females being the most recognizable .\nThe females are much larger than the males and have shells made of calcium carbonate .\nThe male is like all octopus varieties : it has a specialized arm that is used in reproduction .\nIt carries the male reproductive cells and delivers them to the female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarity quickly ends .\nThe male argonaut has the unique ability to detach this specialized arm from its body .\nAfter detaching , this limb will swim on its own to the female and is then stored inside her body , for later use .\nThe male argonaut achieves this by taking advantage of general octopus biology .\nAn octopus has nine brains .\nThere is one brain in each arm , and one brain in the head .\nThe suction cups on the arm of an octopus also contain olfactory organs ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result , each arm can act independently after detaching .\nFor the argonaut , this characteristic is taken advantage of in reproduction .\nTo avoid being eaten by the much larger female , the male detaches its

, is unknown .\nWhat we do know is that post-reproductive death in both sexes of the octopus is caused by the optic gland .\nThe gland becomes very active as it preps the body for reproduction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the digestive system ( among other things ) .\nThe result of this is that the animal slowly starves to death , but the disoriented and discolored males are often eaten long before starvation would claim them .\nWhen the optic gland has been surgically removed from females , the female Octopus continues to live beyond reproduction and will leave the nest to forage for food2 .\nA recent study has revealed that a big part of this is tied to changes in cholesterol production in the octopus .\nSomething particularly fascinating about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes we see in the octopus and other organisms that suffer from genetic disorders that result in excessive cholesterol production .\nThe article brings attention to a similar situation observed in human children .\nThe article states : The findings suggest that disruption of cholesterol production process in octopuses has grave consequences , just as it does in other animals.\n\u201d 3 While research into octopus senescence is ongoing with much to be discovered , this finding suggests that the octopus did not originally die after mating .\nRather , this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific Striped octopus still has an optic gland but does not experience these issues after reproducing .\nThe scientists that did this research intend to begin studying the optic gland in lesser Pacific striped octopus to see why they do not experience this cholesterol problem.4 The octopus in general dies after mating .\nThey live to reproduce on one occasion and put forth great effort to find the best mate .\nThe males must be very cautious during this process as females will often attempt to eat the males .\nThe arrangement is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female cautiously and attempts to get her to receive the sperm package , and the male remains prepared to flee just in case the female decides to eat him .\nThe males die shortly after delivering their sperm package to the female .\nThe female continues for a much longer period .\nAfter she lays her

@ @ @ @ .\nHow is this strange reproductive method explained by evolution ?\nEvolution is all about random mutations altering how successfully an organism can reproduce .\nThis can occur by making the animal better at defending itself , having larger litters , or producing a smaller number of offspring but those children are less likely to die before reproducing .\nUltimately \u201c survival of the

\u2018 fittest \u2019 .\nNow that we have clarified this , we can look at how evolutionists have attempted to explain this method of reproduction .\nIt has been proposed that their naturally short lifespan may serve to prevent rapid overpopulation.5 Now , while this initially seems counterintuitive ( why would pre-programmed limitations on reproductive success be beneficial for reproductive success ? )\none could speculate that in their evolutionary past , many octopus populations grew too quickly and collapsed as a result .\nSo the octopus that developed this mutation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-lasting population since their numbers didn \u2019 t grow at unsustainable rates .\nOf course , the idea that this evolved for population control breaks down when we look at the Larger Pacific Striped Octopus , and the Lesser Pacific Striped Octopus .\nThese Pacific Striped Octopuses are not particularly special compared to other varieties except in two areas : reproduction , and social behavior .\nAmong the Larger Pacific Striped Octopus , females and males have a more gentle , intimate courtship process .\nThe male does not fear being eaten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mating .\nAfterward , the female will lay her eggs , and the male will often live with the female while the eggs incubate ; he will share food with the female .\nAfter the eggs hatch , the male and female will stay at the nest , and provide for their babies .\nUnlike other species , the male and female do not die shortly after fulfilling their role in the reproductive process .\nInstead , they continue to live and reproduce on multiple occasions .\nThe evolutionary justification for a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it prevents overpopulation .\nHowever , at the same time this variety of octopus can spawn multiple times throughout its life and the evolutionary tale is that this reproductive method is superior .\n\u201c This species \u2019 females can also produce several batches of eggs , making them superior to other species that die after laying their first eggs.\n\u201d 6 .\nIf this reproductive method is superior , then why did evolution favor the exact opposite reproductive method in what is essentially the same creature ?\nWhat \u2019 s sauce for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis is a good example of why evolution is useless to real-world biology .\nWhich came first : single or multiple reproduction ?\nIt also

taken for granted .\nIn 10 chapters and a \u2018 Final Words \u2019 section , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be heard and heeded .\nSo what is Scrivener \u2019 s main thesis ?\nI can do no better than quote the publisher \u2019 s own succinct statement : From chapter two onwards , the author builds his case , and this review will follow the chapter headings , highlighting just a few points from each .\nScrivener begins by quoting Israeli historian and best-selling author Yuval Noah Harari , noting that he buys wholesale into the disturbing evolutionary story of Homo sapiens coming to dominate his environment through ruthlessness and greed.3,4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about human rights ; he admits that God and the human rights story are intertwined .\nUnlike ancient creation myths , however , Genesis 1:1 is \u201c a different story , with a different God and a very different outcome for the valuation of humans \u201d ( p. 51 ) .\nScrivener faithfully outlines the Genesis narrative while bypassing discussion as to its historicity , or whether the creation days are literal or not .\nHe simply states : Throughout the book , the teaching of Genesis is positively upheld , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Darwinian evolution seems to be cast in a negative light .\nA hint that Scrivener may hold some sort of \u2018 old-earth \u2019 creation view is his description of mankind \u2019 s creation in Genesis 2 as a \u2018 poetic vision \u2019 ( p. 55 ) .\nEverything else he writes about Genesis 1\u20133 in the book affirms the distinctness of the biblical record\u2014contrary to those neo-evangelicals who see Genesis as a reworked Ancient Near East myth .\nThe image of God in man is affirmed , \u201c Then Adam and Eve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that voice\u2014the command of God\u2014and chaos ensues \u201d ( p. 56 ) .\nThere is no embarrassment about affirming Genesis to non-Christian readers .\nAfter all , this account underpins what people in our increasingly \u2018 woke \u2019 culture care deeply about ( figure 1 ) : Arch-Darwinist Richard Dawkins raised a furore when he alleged it was a moral responsibility to abort babies with Downs Syndrome.5 In any case , logically , compassion is antithetical to evolution ; pity is a poison within his worldview .\nLikewise , Scrivener shows that Nietzsche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which he believed had led to human existence ) to immorality and ethics .\nIt \u2019 s no wonder Nietzsche was avowedly anti-Christian .\nIn stark contrast , the author provides a wonderful description of the Cross work of Jesus , who was \u2018 compassion incarnate \u2019 .\nAn obvious outcome is that Christians show compassion .\n\u201c But there \u2019 s nothing natural about this .\nNature is \u2018 red in tooth and claw \u2019 , as the poet Tennyson put it \u201d ( p. 74 ) .\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , not least evolutionism .\nIt is why , in some countries , we refer to government officials as \u2018 ministers \u2019 , the old English word for servant\u2014like

societies where Christianity was never embraced .\nIn our salacious age , promiscuity is considered a basic freedom , yet sexual abuse and rape are legislated against , and prostitution is ordinarily frowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our sexual scruples .\nIn licentious Rome , a visit to one of the numerous brothels cost the equivalent of a loaf of bread .\nHowever , \u201c Christianity brought an earthquake in sexual morality \u201d ( p. 87 ) .\nJesus \u2019 teaching often referred his hearers back to Genesis ; e.g .\nthat which concerns divorce and remarriage \u201c represents the death of casual sex .\nIt \u2019 s also the death of easy divorce \u201d ( Matthew 19:3\u20139 ) .\nWhat about those who remain single ?\n\u201c Christ holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In evolutionary terms , such singleness is a dead end \u201d ( p. 92 ) .\nBut the Bible is not prudish , and sex within marriage is positively encouraged ( 1 Cor .\n7:4\u20135 ) .\nSuch teaching was radical in the ancient world .\nIt meant that \u201c The Church became a place of dignity , protection , and provision for women \u201d ( p. 95 ) .\nAnd while sexual abuse and paedophilia are rightly condemned today , pre-Christianity things were

Inquisition ( 1478\u20131834 ) were dreadful but were grotesque contradictions of biblical Christianity .\nIn fact , says Scrivener , \u201c If we are outraged by the Crusades \u2026 that is Christian outrage we \u2019 re experiencing \u201d ( p. 115 ) .\nAnd dreadful though the Spanish Inquisition was , the documented deaths were eclipsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries .\nDuring just three years of the

.\nthe Gregorian Reforms of 1020\u20131055 ) , universities were established ( from the early 13th century onwards ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ages were not barren , as many believe .\nAny idea that the Age of Reason ( aka Enlightenment ) began with shaking off Christian hegemony is a myth .\nIngrained in our culture is the false notion that Christian religion is at war with science ( the \u2018 conflict thesis \u2019 ) .\nAgain , Scrivener does not shrink from affirming God \u2019 s divine prerogative in creation .\nGenesis 1:1 , he says , shows \u201c God is free .\nWhen He chooses to make the world , He shapes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s exactly as He wants it \u201d ( p. 132 ) .\nDisappointingly , in rightly affirming God \u2019 s superintendence of the creation , he allows for deep time : This fly in the ointment notwithstanding , all that follows is faithful to Genesis and related as if an entirely factual account .\nThe author talks of great thinkers , from Augustine to William of Ockham , to Isaac Newton ( and many more ) .\nHe affirms , as have many others , that science was birthed within medieval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galilei , it was not that the church invoked Scripture against science , rather \u201c They backed a majority of scientists against a minority \u201d ( p. 141 ) .9 In 2020 , in many countries , statues of many former dignitaries were vandalized and toppled ; virtually no memorial was safe if the person was deemed to have had a shady past regarding slavery or racism .\nThe US Declaration of Independence ( figure 2 ) famously celebrated the rights of all , \u201c But outside of a biblical foundation , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest thinkers and moralists\u2014has known about human rights \u201d ( pp .\n151\u2013152 ) .\nIt \u2019 s common knowledge that Christians strove to abolish the slave trade in the 18th and 19th centuries .\nOnetime slave Frederick Douglas ( 1817\u20131895 ) later became a great abolitionist and friend of Abraham Lincoln ; without doubt , Douglas \u2019 Christian faith informed his views .\nSimilarly , Negro Spiritual songs resonate with the Israelites \u2019 bondage in Egypt and with a redemptive theme that owes much to the Gospel of Christ .\nFar from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves for redemption .\nThus , Jesus declared a Jubilee for all , opening the way for many to be freed from the darkness and bondage of sin ( Luke 4:18\u201319 ) .\nIn 1842 , slavery was dubbed \u2018 a crime against humanity \u2019 .\nNevertheless , abolitionism was a religious movement because slavery was especially a crime against the Creator .\nScrivener observes , \u201c Now we live on this side of abolition , and our moral imaginations find it nearly impossible to leap backwards \u201d ( p. 166 ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ are breathing Christian air , albeit unacknowledged or disavowed by most .\nScrivener points out that progress sometimes has a dark side .\nDarwin proclaimed biological progress , Hegel , historical progress , Freud , psychological progress , and Marx , economic and political progress .\nThe ugly fruit of such philosophies notwithstanding , Christian ideals run through them like veins in a blue cheese .\nBut without a vertical reference ( God unacknowledged ) , the desire for progress all too easily spawns violence .\nThe 20th century was the most blood-stained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 .\nThink of Stalin \u2019 s Holodomor ( Ukrainian : murder by famine ) and purge of tens of millions in the 1930s , or of Chairman Mao \u2019 s \u2018 Great Leap Forwards \u2019 ( 1958\u20131962 ) , where over 45 million died of overwork , starvation , or murder\u2014not to mention the horrors of death camps like Auschwitz .\nPost WWII , a moral standard was needed to establish the \u2018 self-evident \u2019 moral truths so bespattered by the Nazis .\nAs with slavery , those atrocities were deemed \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were crimes against God .\nIf they were merely \u201c crimes against humanity \u201d , we have a dilemma , for humanity was on both sides ( evil oppressors and their victims ) .\nScrivener states pithily , \u201c If we \u2019 re all squabbling apes , then there \u2019 s no transcendent justice in condemning Nazism \u201d ( p. 181 ) .\nSo what price progress ?\nSecularism today , having fled past evils , now pursues values like rights , freedom , and progress , but divorces them from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s thesis in Dominion\u2014without Christianity \u2019 s humanity-enhancing teaching about the image of God , the ruthless suppression of weaker minorities

and unrest in the US and around the world .\nFloyd was quickly portrayed by many as a saint , even a Christ figure .\nThere were communal acts of identification , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and celebrities everywhere were \u2018 taking the knee \u2019 .\nAll \u201c these gestures , slogans and movements came together with a remarkable force \u2026 [ and ] they are Christian in their source \u201d , says the author ( p. 189 ) .\n\u201c Whether people realise it or not , these culture wars involved devout believers hurling Bible verses at one another\u2014they \u2019 ve just forgotten the references \u201d ( p. 190 ) , to the detriment of society .\nIt is the same story with other contemporary debates .\nTransgender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent , but they divorce these from Christianity and recombine them differently .\nEquality becomes a radical individualism as people emphasize rights over institutions and community .\nCompassion risks becoming what sociologists have termed \u2018 competitive victimhood \u2019 , and perceived victim status is used to gain advantage .\nThis leads to clashes between different minority groups\u2014e.g .\nfeminists versus trans-rights activists\u2014so whose suffering takes precedence ?\nDivorcing sexual consent from Christian values is a wrecking ball as far as marriage , family , and the wider community are concerned .\nAs Scrivener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is not a sufficient foundation for sexual ethics \u201d ( p. 194 ) .\nProgressive secularization is not a sustainable strategy !\nThe WEIRD ( Western , Educated , Industrialized , Rich , and Democratic ) values upon which Scrivener \u2019 s book focuses are strongly believed by all , but people in Western society are making a hash of applying them in everyday life .\nCompared to the ancient world , equality , compassion , consent , enlightenment , science , freedom , and progress were given a makeover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hearts of modern people .\nAs Scrivener says , \u201c These are our creedal convictions , and , by and large , we are a society of believers \u201d ( p. 197 ) .\nBut even as people are straining to discard Christianity , they continue with their moralizing : And anyone can find themselves a target , especially , as the author wryly observes , with the turbo-charging of outrage made possible by social media .\nIn today \u2019 s \u2018 cancel culture \u2019 , there is plenty of guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere in sight !\nScrivener is right on the money in noting that the denial of King Jesus , while trying to retain Christian ideals , brings judgment , not liberation : People need the Gospel of hope , so the author invites readers to consider how history will judge them\u2014more especially how will God judge them ?\nWonderfully , Christ came not to police people \u2019 s morals so much as to heal them , to cleanse and forgive needy , despondent human beings .\nIt is good to see that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time to Genesis 3:15 in closing out the book , the prophesied redemption through the woman \u2019 s seed ( a Saviour ) .\nHe shows the unfolding of the promise in the pages of the Old Testament , not least the prophesies of Isaiah and Daniel .\n\u201c No wonder messianic expectation was at fever pitch in the 1st century \u201d ( p. 211 ) , because Israel was under the rule of Rome .\nChrist came , predicting the triumph of His kingdom , though via His death and Resurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Genesis promise .\nBut maybe the whole story was fabricated ?\nScrivener skilfully defends the Gospels and their accounts of Christ , and he does so in a highly original and compelling manner , demonstrating their sheer genius .\nThe strong evangelistic approach is fresh , not hackneyed .\nJesus , the History Maker , is the One behind the values so cherished by the West\u2014He embodies them .\nIn fact , Christ loved this world to death , pioneering life for all violators of those values through His Resurrection .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the end .\nIn its closing pages , Scrivener appeals in turn to the three categories of readers mentioned in the second paragraph of this review .\nIt is refreshingly honest and very well executed .\nTo Christians , he writes , \u201c In all this , great wisdom is needed to discern the Christian-ish values of a WEIRD culture from true Christianity \u201d ( p. 230 )

interpretation of what the Messel lake was like .\nThe notion of a stratified lake works as an explanation for the turtles \u2019 fate , Cadena says , \u2018 but not so well for other fossils found at Messel , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mammals \u2019 .\nIf the upper layers of the lake were inhabitable , Cadena asks , then what caused the death of airborne and terrestrial animals ?\nThe turtles are

Geophysics , University of Utah , USA , have recently gained greater insights into how they got around \u2018 long ago \u2019 .\nYou are probably familiar with fossil ammonites , classically found along the Jurassic Coast of England .\nTheir lovely spiral whorls look a bit like coiled snakes ( figure 1 ) ; and there are other types with different shapes .\nIn life , they would have been similar to the modern nautilus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see Amazing Argonauts ) .\nThey had tentacles protruding from the shell \u2019 s opening , along with their head , mouthparts , eyes , and syphon ( figure 2 ) , with which the animal propelled itself backwards , using jet-like pulses of water .\nBut how well did they swim , when they look so ungainly ?\nNow , thanks to a lot of clever 3D model printing and animatronic wizardry\u2014more technically \u2018 biomimetic \u2019 ( mimicking biology ) robotics\u2014scientists have likely figured out how these mysterious creatures got around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn secular thinking this was the so-called Jurassic era ( 201\u2013145 million years ago ) , which in biblical terms is part of the \u2018 pre-Flood era \u2019 .\nReleasing their robot creations into a swimming pool and a flow-tank , they carefully monitored and filmed them.1 The researchers published their findings in Scientific Reports outlining their methods and results which are thought to mimic the movements in water of these fascinating extinct creatures.2 Various hollow models of ammonites were created using a process called 3D printing , which casts a resin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from computer instructions .\nThe advantages of such construction methods are many , but primarily , such devices can construct accurate and highly complex shapes easily , using very cheap materials ( plastic ) .\nThe ammonite models were made to vary according to the possibilities inherent in the shell morphology , and seen within the fossil record .\nThree major forms were identified : ( a ) serpenticone ( tight whorls , narrow shell ) , ( b ) oxycone ( thick whorls , narrow , streamlined shell ) , ( c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide , nearly spherical shell ) ; a fourth variable ( d ) termed \u2018 morphospace center \u2019 equates to the overall centers of buoyancy and mass ( of the average ammonite ) ( figure 3 ) .\nThese four points ( shown as end members and central point on a triangular diagram ) could be varied to any degree , to see which forms had the best hydrodynamic performance ( measuring drag , wake dynamics,3 and turbulence ) .\nInterestingly , it was found that no particular shape had any more advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ( from an engineering perspective ) shapes well designed to float , or swim , while staying vertically oriented in water .\nThe various shaped shells were packed with clever battery-powered robotics , mimicking the jets that modern nautiloids produce .\nInfrared sensors were also placed inside the models to check orientation , acceleration , coasting efficiency , jetting dynamics , hydrodynamic stability , maneuverability , and moment of inertia.4 Each model was carefully calibrated , so that no one shape had any competitive advantages in terms of thrust .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was water-tight and neutrally buoyant , meaning it neither sank , nor floated , but could easily maneuver , like the real thing.3 The results of the investigation were plotted5 and mathematically modelled , demonstrating a trade-off between hydrodynamic stability and yaw maneuverability ( rotation around the vertical axis ) ( figure 4 ) .\nThe researchers recognized this meant there were advantages for different environments .\nThis in their words means there is : \u201c no single optimum conch [ shell ] morphology \u201d and \u201c \u2026 there is no morphology that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best \u201d swimmer.\n\u201d 2 Earlier research done on another variety of straight shelled ( orthocone ) cephalopod , demonstrated that , surprisingly , they would have lived in the vertical orientation ( heads pointing downwards ) , not horizontal , as previously thought.6 Throughout the report the researchers constantly use design language to describe their research , for instance : Such language implies clever forethought , planning , organizing , and implementing of plans by intelligent agents ( human scientists ) , in order to manufacture complex systems .\nNone of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over indeterminate periods of time .\nEvery step was managed and monitored to achieve desired outcomes\u2014the very essence of good , operational science .\nIndeed , as we often point out about operational/experimental science ( as distinct from historical science ) , the team \u2019 s work was repeatable , observable , and measurable\u2014all done in the here-and-now .\nHowever , when it comes to the extinct organisms the scientists were trying to copy ( whose complexity is far greater by multiple orders of magnitude ) , an entirely different world-view of \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes into play .\nThis was seen with the scientists \u2019 own descriptions of the ammonites \u2019 origins and complex biology , and in reports of their study .\nA few of many examples are : The inconsistency of such thinking should be glaringly obvious .\nEvolution is not observed to happen today , neither can blind , random processes produce anything .\nThe latter examples therefore amount to faith statements , rather than scientific conclusions .\nThe robotic systems , though ingenious and complex , are really a pale shadow compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammonites .\nThe researchers could only mimic a tiny fraction of the ammonites \u2019 swimming abilities .\nWhen it comes to all the other abilities of these extinct creatures\u2014i.e.\n, to metabolize their food , sense their environments , grow , heal , or reproduce themselves\u2014the scientists would be left scratching their heads .\nFurthermore , even ammonite internal organs have been discovered , demonstrating their complexity .\nNatural selection is also invoked within the research : In this research and modelling , the selection was done intelligently , not left to chance\u2014it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should realize that natural selection can only play the hand it is dealt\u2014it can not add new information specifying for complexity that doesn \u2019 t already exist .\nHowever , natural selection , post-Fall , almost certainly did produce much variation within the cephalopod created kind which includes ammonites , as per the creation account ( Genesis 1:20\u201323 ) .\nIn which case , the amazing variety within the ammonite kind can be explained in terms of natural selection working on the existing genetic potential already pre-programmed .\nThe minor variations in whorl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fossil record8 all suit their particular environments .\nGod is a God of variety and loves diversity within His creation .\nAmmonites were buried along with many other marine and all land creatures not on board the Ark during Noah \u2019 s Flood , nearly 4,500 years ago .\nAmmonites were specially created by God on day five of creation week along with all the other swimming ( and flying ) creatures to fill His newly created world , declared \u201c very good \u201d one day later ( Genesis 1:31 ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , after the Fall , could adapt to new environmental pressures , according to their existing genetic programming .\nThe ability of ammonites to swim , as studied by the scientists in this latest research , demonstrates their optimal design at the hand of the Creator .\nProperly considered , the clever biomimetic robot creations of the scientists provide no encouragement to believers in evolution .\nThese ingenious hydrodynamic experiments actually demonstrate the genius of the Creator \u2019 s original biological designs .\nNevertheless , we also observe the blatant inconsistency @ @ @ @ @ @

and silting of the Ephesus Harbour within biblical history As sea levels rose at the end of the Ice Age previously extended river valleys were flooded , forming dendritic estuaries known as \u2018 rias \u2019 .\nMany of these rias subsequently silted up within recorded history .\nExamples exist from across the world of delta formation : the Rhine and Rh\u00f4ne rivers in Europe , the Ebro river in Spain , the Egyptian Nile , and the Mississippi in the Gulf of Mexico .\nThe geomorphology of delta formation is dependent upon a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ density , river flow rates , offshore currents , tidal range , and wave energy .\nThis paper will focus upon the Cayster or Kaystros ( Ancient Greek : \u039a\u03ac\u03cb\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 / Turkish : K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Menderes ) river estuary at ancient Ephesus , located on the coast of western Turkey , much of which silted up within recorded history .\nFigure 1 shows the location .\nThe ancient city of Ephesus is well known to Christians from the New Testament .\nPaul preached there during his ministry ( Acts 19 ) , and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by rioting , led by adherents of the goddess Artemis , who were concerned about loss of revenue from the trade in idols .\nDuring this time there was a harbour at Ephesus , and the city was the Roman capital in Asia Minor in the time of Augustus ( figure 2 ) .\nBut the harbour was slowly silting up .\nIn fact , the harbour and estuary of the Kaystros river had been silting up for many centuries prior to this , and this continued through the Roman and Christian eras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul knew are several kilometres inland from the coast ( figure 3 ) .\nIt is evident that coastal margins have changed markedly since the end of the Ice Age , and within the timeframe of human history .\nMuch of this is recorded in written sources , understood through archaeology and examination of the geomorphology .\nThis discussion will highlight ongoing secular research , and show that deposition has occurred within recorded history over centuries , and can be fitted within a biblical timeframe .\nThis points to relatively recent adjustments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Age epochs .\nAt the peak of the post-Flood Ice Age , with millions of cubic kilometres of water locked up in ice , sea levels were an estimated 50 m below current levels,1 and then rose to near current levels as the ice melted .\nOnce the sea level had risen and flooded valleys at the end of the Ice Age , the process of sedimentation began in newly formed rias , or marine gulfs .\nDelta formation in this valley may be classified as a freshwater tidal delta , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub-estuaries are formed.2 Fresh water washes material downstream and deposits it where the tidal ebb-and-flow meets the river flow .\nThe twice-daily tidal hiatus of the river flow causes deposition of suspended material within the estuary , as do periodic river floods .\nThe natural process of deposition of sediment in the flood plain is often accelerated by human activity : e.g .\nforest clearance for agriculture by a growing population increased the rate of land erosion , and sediment load in the river .\nThis increase in population occurred after the post-Babel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virgin land .\nThe first human settlers in this area are described as Neolithic and believed to have arrived in the valley around 5000 to 3000 by secular science .\nThe Neolithic people are said to have developed settled farming practices through animal rearing and crop plantations , but had not yet developed the skills of metallurgy , which is identified as the later Bronze Age , Iron Age , etc .\nHowever , the division of history in this way is really built on the secular myth of an evolutionary progression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second millennium bc the Arzawa kingdom had located its capital at Apasa ( Ephesus ) , later settled by Mycenaean expansion around 1300 .3 The Archaic Greek or Ionic period can be traced from about the 10th to the 6th century bc .\nThe first temple of Artemis ( Artemision ) was attributed to the semi-mythical Amazons by the Greek poet Callimachus in the Hymn of Artemis , although a site of worship probably existed here prior to Greek arrival .\nThis temple , built near the water \u2019 s edge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7th century , and rebuilt by Croesus , the Lydian king around 550 following conquest of the city .\nThe location of the temple was to the north-east of Mount Pion ( figures 1 and 2 ) .\nIt was later destroyed by fire in 356 , and rebuilt again from 323 .\nThe Classical Greek period continued from 500 to 350 , the Hellenistic period from 350 , and the Roman period from around 129 .\nThe Byzantine period ran from 395 to 1308 , followed by the Ottoman era .\nArchaeological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artemision and access roads covered by 5 or 6 m of alluvial and colluvial material ( figure 4 ) .\nDuring the Hellenistic period , the city and harbour were sequentially moved downstream , for example by Lysimachus around 290 , with progradation of the estuary .\nBut even the new harbour became difficult to navigate .\nThe Roman historian Titus Livius ( 63 to 17 ) recorded that the harbour entrance at Ephesus in 190 was \u201c like a river : long and narrow and full of shoals \u201d .4 Attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had adverse consequences .\nStrabo ( 64 to 23 ) noted the further narrowing of the entrance with the establishment of a m\u014dl\u0113s , an estuary embankment that separated the river from the harbour , and hindered the \u201c ebb and flow of the tides \u201d .5 The geomorphology , particularly the sedimentary features of the Kaystros valley , has been changing over several millennia , and examined over recent decades through the utilization of core samples , archaeology , and ancient texts , and described in several papers.6-8 The valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a graben , known today as the K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Menderes graben .\nThe implication is that the valley has been displaced vertically downwards along faults that run parallel with the valley .\nThis region suffers from damaging earthquakes as a result of numerous faults in the region .\nSuch local isostatic changes to the sea level may be several metres over the past few thousand years , with eustatic changes around 1\u20132 m at the most .\nKraft et al .\nsuggest a lowering of sea levels of up to 2 m between 1000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise to today \u2019 s level.6,8 The surrounding hills are horsts , having been displaced vertically upwards .\nThe Menderes mountain range in this area is formed of hard crystalline metamorphic rocks\u2014identified as Palaeozoic and Lower Mesozoic by secular science\u2014typically gneiss and granite-mica schist , and phyllite , quartzite , and marble .\nAlong with this are Miocene\u2013Neogene softer deposits of marly limestone , sandstone , and clays.6,8 With uplift and erosion during the late Neogene/Quaternary , re-interpreted here as the recessional period of the Flood , and with excessive rainfall in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive denudation and modification to the landform occurred .\nAt the peak of the Ice Age the lower valley floor was some 30 m deeper than today \u2019 s level , with the seashore extended westwards and some 50 m below current levels .\nAt the end of the Ice Age , following associated rises in sea level , the sea encroached some 18\u201320 km inland along the newly formed ria.7 The Kaystros valley narrows above Ephesus , and then opens out into a wider plain , part of which was then Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marshy lake ( figure 1 ) .\nDuring the Ice Age this was a freshwater lake , then became brackish as sea water flooded the valley at the end of the Ice Age .\nAs delta progradation began in the Kaystros valley , the lake became cutoff from the ocean and reverted to a freshwater lake once more , but continued to accumulate sediment .\nStock et al .\ntrace the start of lake sedimentation back to 8,000 years before present , with descriptions of two core samples from near the lake shore.9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along approximately 14 km of the valley , through an estimated period of about 5,000\u20137,000 years ( figure 1 ) .6,8 This is proposed from the Neolithic period , with substantial amounts of alluvial and colluvial deposits subsequently causing the estuary to silt up .\nAlluvial deposits have been brought down the valley along the river , and colluvial material by the action of gravity , earthquakes , rainfall , and other factors acting on the eroding of the hill sides .\nHuman activity , involving forest clearances and tilling of the soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erosion and deposition as the population grew .\nRates of sedimentation are also dependent upon the hardness and consolidation of the bedrock .\nKraft et al .\nestimated that sedimentation was accelerated in the Classical period ( 400\u2013200 ) as erosional use of the land increased , followed by a more gradual accumulation through the Roman and Byzantine period , and into the modern period .\nTheir estimation is that an approximate 10 m depth of sediment accumulated between 3000 and 400 , and 10 m between 400 and 200 : an approximate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a cross-section is shown in figure 5 ) .\nHowever , estimates of population size and growth rates in ancient Greece are varied , with some studies suggesting that the population in this region grew more than ten-fold between 800 and 400 , along with colonization of the coastal regions of Asia Minor .\nBut other estimates of growth rates are lower.10 This does however suggest the feasibility of faster rates of sedimentation prior to 400 , if population growth were faster .\nThrough the several-thousand-year period of human settlement , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , several km in width , and 30 m in depth , became completely filled in with sediment.6,8 The shape of the delta was evidently changeable through the period of progradation , which can itself affect rates of deposition.11 During the Hellenistic and early Roman period the Kaystros river deltaic sequences displayed typical \u2018 bird \u2019 s feet \u2019 or dendritic distributaries , composed of sand and silt .\nRates of sedimentation tend to be faster adjacent to the river channels .\nAs delta progradation neared the open sea , sandy coastal barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By this time , the harbour at Ephesus was no longer accessible.12 The river valley now displays typical meanders in the silted-up estuary , with cut-off , oxbow sections .\nThe river was diverted into a canal towards the north of the flood plain in the 1930s , which , from satellite imagery , has evidently altered the shape of the beach with several hundred metres of new beach-front in about 90 years .\nCurrent rates of deposition have reduced because of water extraction , and coastal erosion has become a concern.12 With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Roman harbour at Ephesus , it can be seen that during the Roman period of Augustus there is evidence that the harbour went through a more rapid period of silting , and a period of anoxic conditions .\nThe cause of this is not clear , but may be related to the construction of the harbour embankment .\nThe rate is estimated at 20 cm/y , or 7 m over several decades , followed by a slower process until becoming dry in the early Middle Ages .\nThe city of Ephesus was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed waste water into the harbour , but various earthquakes may have disrupted this water supply .\nThis may have encouraged the build-up of sediment along with the formation of the embankment.7 Carbon radiometric dating has been correlated with archaeological and written sources by researchers at this location , where available .\nThis helps with validation , as the presence of carbon-14 may be affected by contamination from a number of physical sources.13 More widely , a comparative correction is normally made to the raw data of samples or artefacts to account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based upon dendrochronology back to 9,000 years before present ( BP ) , although dendrochronology is not without problems : for example , some tree species are known to show multiple growth rings per year,15,16 or the chronologies are artificially extended through weakly attached crossmatching \u2018 bridges \u2019 .17 At the longer time frame to 25,000 BP correlation utilizes sequences of corals , along with calibration with U/Th dating.18 Errors in marine dating are also not easy to iron out .\nThe uptake of carbon in marine organisms , in terms of calcium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrections .\nIt is known for example that some living marine organisms have an apparent age of approximately 400 years.19 This is denoted as the marine reservoir effect : as R ( t ) = c. 400 radiocarbon years ( 14C y ) , which is a global average .\nBut there are regional variations : referred to as \u0394R .\nThere are several methodologies used to determine \u0394R\u2014e.g .\ncorrelation with known age samples that utilize museum specimens , tephra isochrones , or the pairing of marine and terrestrial samples near to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a number of reasons .\nOcean water takes longer to mix and reach equilibrium with the atmosphere .\nWater mixing is dependent upon the water temperature and the salinity , and slower mixing at depth requires thousands of years to reach equilibrium in the ocean .\nCold ocean water gives excessive radiocarbon dates , with examples in polar regions ( R ( t ) + \u0394R ) of around 800\u20131,200 14C y ( where \u0394R = c. 400 to 800 14C y ) .\nThe Mediterranean Sea has generally lower values of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u0394R of 40 to 253 14C y .\nThis is dependent upon natural variations in ocean concentrations , with perhaps some influence from different methodological approaches .\nNo further correction is normally applied for the tropics and equator ( \u0394R \u2248 0 14C y ) .18 It is also recognized that marine reservoir corrections may be time dependent , and related to climatic changes over millennia,18 but with uncertainty regarding detail .\nFor example , Ascough et al .\nsuggest that during the Younger Dryas ( ~12,000 years BP ) \u0394R may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location near Iceland , compared with 380 14C y today .\nWithin the timeframe of a more recent Ice Age , it is feasible that ocean water upwelled to the surface as melting ice established cold deep ocean currents , thus leading to near-surface water with an excessive apparent carbon-14 age .\nThe structure of the water column in the Mediterranean Sea at the end of the Ice Age is uncertain , with various possible scenarios .\nThe surface water in the Mediterranean Sea may have been colder and less saline than today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed , similar to the current Black Sea .\nAt the end of the Ice Age , this may have overturned as sea levels rose , or water with an excessive apparent carbon-14 age may have entered from the Atlantic .\nSuch speculation highlights possible sources of error with carbon dating .\nThere is also a sense that prior assumptions that are put into a model determine the outcome , whether biblical or secular .\nFurther errors in radiocarbon dating may arise in tidal zones , where fresh water and salt water meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFresh water entering a tidal estuary may be contaminated by limestone rock layers through which a river may flow , known as the hard water effect , and may give dates older than is warranted .\nLimestone is present in the Kaystros river catchment area .\nA study in Scandinavia found that where there has been a high diet of fish in hard water areas , then carbon-14 analysis of clay pots may be 2,000 years too old , thus significantly misplacing certain artefacts ; in this example previously assigned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laterally in a tidal estuary , or be reworked in sediment , and so specimens used in dating may not be truly representative .\nThe calcium carbonate that forms shells may also interact with water as it is soluble , and so give false readings.21 Further changes to the relative concentration of carbon-14 occur through the long-term solar cycle , a steady rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide from the Ice Age minimum , and decadal changes to geomagnetic fields .\nThe necessity for such considerations widens the margin of error at great depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of carbon dating at earlier times where external corroborating evidence is lacking.22 Archaeological and written records , from the Roman and Classical Greek periods , help to date the history of the Kaystros estuary back to at least 400 , and this can be correlated with carbon dating to gain a reasonably accurate estimate , once corrected .\nA marine reservoir effect correction of 406 years was applied to marine calcium carbonate material from the Ephesus estuary by Kraft et al.\n, based upon measurements from nearby Lake Bafa near Miletus in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sedimentation has taken place .\nThis correction brought the dating into alignment with those of terrestrial sources , and so is reasonably well correlated with archaeology and literature .\nBut even so , there remains a margin of error .\nKraft et al .\noffer an error margin for a Cerastoderma edule shell specimen from sediment taken from the Feigengarten excavation near the bottom of Mount Pion ( from a depth of 3 m ) .\nThis is dated to 89 , with a range of 166 to 9 based upon 67 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 2-Sigma confidence level ( 95 % ) , this widens to 233 to 63.6,8 Core samples taken from the now shallow Lake Belevi are believed by secular research to extend back to 8000 BP , through a depth of up to 12 m , somewhat shallower than core samples in the harbour .\nWith two core samples , a marine reservoir effect R ( t ) of 390 \u00b1 85 14C y , with \u0394R = 35 \u00b1 70 14C y was applied ; this corrected for the mollusc shell Cerastoderma glaucum.9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest correlates with an Ice Age freshwater lake .\nFrom the perspective of the biblical model here it is likely that a great deal of sediment accumulated in the inland plain of the Kaystros valley during the recessional Flood period and Ice Age .\nThis was as a result of excessive hydrological activity from rainfall and floods , and ongoing earthquake activity .\nAlso identified in the peat column from Lake Belevi is a layer of tephra from the Santorini eruption , dated to 1610 \u00b1 15 , which offers a reasonable validation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample .\nWritten records and archaeology increase confidence in dating in the Classical Greek period , but more fragmentary records and widening possible sources of error in carbon dating reduce confidence in the earliest timeframe of core samples .\nThe question here is how this evidence fits into the biblical timeframe , especially at the earliest times where there is secular departure from the biblical account .\nAs noted above , the division of pre-history to Mesolithic , Neolithic , and Bronze Age is built upon the secular myth of an evolutionary progression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genesis 1\u201311 rejected .\nThe Table of Nations informs us who the first settlers were in Greece and Anatolia ( Genesis 10:2\u20135 ) .\nThey were mostly the sons of Japheth : These migrating , extended families were likely contemporaneous with Abraham , travelling westwards , sometime between 2400 and 1900 , after the dispersion from Babel .\nThe account of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob in Genesis reveals an extended family of semi-nomadic shepherds , but not one that ought to be dishonoured by the evolutionary progress myth .\nThe early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people .\nOf course , the travelling people , with their animals , probably had to make do with tools and weapons of stone or bone , which is what archaeologists predominantly find in the earliest times .\nMetal worked implements may have been scarce .\nBut with later settlement , as the needs of the more settled communities increased , metal working was re-started as sources of metal ore were identified and utilized .\nScriptures tells us that knowledge of metal working had been present from the earliest times ( Genesis 4:22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement in the Kaystros valley may then be contested from the biblical record , to around the late third century bc , with the end of the Flood occurring around 2400 according to the Masoretic Text .\nCarbon dating is reasonably accurate when it can be verified against known archaeological and written records , or known volcanic eruptions , but it becomes increasingly unreliable further back in time where there is little or no supporting evidence .\nPossible sources of error have been noted above , such as lack of equilibrium in radiocarbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post-Flood and post-Ice Age period .\nBy taking note of the biblical accounts of Genesis 10 and 11 there is potential for useful additional and independent information that may help to increase the accuracy of radiocarbon dating back to the third millennium bc , and so provide a revised methodology for determining \u0394R.23 The marine reservoir effect may have been significantly greater at the

nervous about taking a stand on the age of the earth , preferring instead a less dogmatic approach .\nI \u2019 m a Christian and have been for some time .\nI enjoy both the Creation and TJ [ now Journal of Creation\u2014 ed . ]\nmagazines .\nHowever I cringe sometimes when I read or hear speakers dogmatically say the Biblical stance is that the Earth is seven or so thousand years old .\nI know it seems that way , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it is categorically proved ( or the evidence strongly suggests ) that the Earth is much older , say millions of years old , that a lot of people will discard the more important things the Bible talks about .\nMy suggestion is why not take the safer less dogmatic stance and say something like \u201c there is strong Biblical support that suggests the age of the Earth is seven or so thousand years , but this should not be taken as Biblical doctrine or dogma \u201d or something like that .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to crumble into a heap with a lot of people with it when one places the credibility of Scripture on such shaky doctrine as the age of the Earth .\n\u2018 Dogmatically \u2019 can imply merely asserting something while neglecting to

multifarious scientific facts ( see \u2018 Young \u2019 age of the Earth & Universe Q & A ) , whereas theirs is a credulous faith , severely inconsistent with much scientific data ( see How old is the earth ) .\nMost biblical creationists say the world is about 6,000 years old .\nSome say \u2018 the earth is no more than 10,000 years old , max \u2019 , but that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an order of magnitude .\nIf we accept that the Bible is reliable , an age of about 6,000 years is unavoidable .\nSee Biblical chronogenealogies .\nFor nigh on two millennia , Christians have consistently calculated the age of the earth to be just a few thousand years\u2014see the table in Old earth or young earth belief .\nBut in the late 1700s / early 1800s anti-Christian deists such as Lyell and Hutton deliberately rejected reliable historical records such as the Bible in favour of the unprovable and highly unreasonable assumption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scientists begin to believe in millions of years .\nSee The origin of old-earth geology , Hutton \u2019 s a priori commitment to materialism and Darwin , Lyell and billions of years .\nNote nothing in the physical facts of geology

rely on unprovable assumptions .\nSee Immeasurable age .\nThe only accurate way to determine age is from reliable historical records , and among ancient records the Bible stands alone for its supreme reliability .\nThe science that generates the many technologies we enjoy today is operational science , which involves repeated observation and testing .\nSee Is it science ?\nBut historical events , such as the creation or evolution of man , lie within the realm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the scientific method to either prove or disprove .\nWe can not directly observe or measure events that occurred in the past .\nArtifacts , fossils and rocks do not \u2018 speak for themselves \u2019 but must be interpreted within a framework of beliefs about the past .\nSee Faith and facts and this article on the role of axioms which determine the framework in which data are interpreted .\nThe fact is that the Bible is reliable , including in what it says about the age of the earth .\nYes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not without good reason .\nAs noted above ( see \u2018 Young \u2019 age of the Earth & Universe Q & A ) there is a multitude of scientific data ( observations , measurements ) which are extraordinarily difficult to reconcile with a long-age view of history , and yet readily make sense from a young-earth creationist perspective .\nIt is the same with the Resurrection ; scientists will never be able to categorically prove it did not happen , and there is much evidence that only makes sense if it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thousands of first century Christians .\nSee Did Jesus Christ really rise from the dead ?\nAlmighty God , the very Creator of language , has informed us plainly in the Bible that Jesus rose from the dead , so we need not worry that one day , say , an archaeologist will discover the bones of Jesus .\nEven if an archaeologist were to make such a claim , we know that it couldn \u2019 t be correct .\nChristianity could have been cut off at its roots if the Pharisees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body or bones of Jesus , which would have distinctive marks due to crucifixion with nails ( John 20:25 ) .\nOf course they never did produce such evidence because the tomb was empty on the third day .\nWe can be confident in what the Bible says about the Resurrection and other miraculous historical events , without needing to seek naturalistic explanations as some do ( see Materialist \u2018 defence \u2019 of Bible fails , The ten plagues of Egypt : Miracles or \u2018 Mother Nature \u2019 and Did Jesus walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be confident in what the Bible says about the age of the earth

.\nOur own Managing Director and former atheist , Dr Carl Wieland , had no respect for Christians until he met some who unashamedly believed Genesis : Throughout the West , many traditional churches have abandoned the authority of the Bible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAfter all , as Jesus said , if we don \u2019 t believe what the Bible says about earthly things ( like history ) how can we expect anyone to believe what it says about heavenly things , like sin and salvation ( John 3:12 ) ?\nJesus said if people didn \u2019 t believe Moses ( i.e .\nGenesis etc . )\nthen they wouldn \u2019 t believe Him either ( Luke 16:31 ) .\nIn contrast , churches that hold to the authority of the Bible , including its straightforward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense being a Christian is a matter of allegiance\u2014giving our allegiance to Jesus Christ and choosing to heed God \u2019 s Word as authoritative , rather than heeding the fallible theories of fallen man .\nSee Even champions can be inconsistent .\nFor reasons explained above , it is not possible for science to disprove the biblical age of the earth .\nPeople tend to crave certainty , and many Christians long for a \u2018 magic bullet \u2019 that would

in the last two centuries has bounced over a stupefying six orders of magnitude , each new \u2018 true \u2019 age being dogmatically proclaimed with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true \u2019 age is denounced !\nSee Western culture and the age of the earth .\nJesus frequently referred to events and persons from Genesis , always treating them as historical , and since Jesus is God , He should know .\nThe credibility of Scripture is not threatened by fallible human theories about the age of the earth .\nHowever , the true age of the earth as indicated in the Bible is indeed a threat to rebellious mankind , who want to exclude God from human affairs .\nThe events of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldview .\nEvery major Christian doctrine has its origin and basis in Genesis\u2014doctrines such as the nature of God , the nature of man , the nature of marriage , the origin of sin , the cause of death and the need of a blood sacrifice .\nFor example , how can the idea of billions of years of death and suffering before Adam \u2019 s Fall be reconciled with the idea of a caring God , who declared everything \u2018 very good \u2019 ( Genesis 1:31 ) ?\nSee The god of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cosmic catastrophe .\nAnti-Christians are only too aware of the foundational importance of Genesis history to the Christian faith , as acknowledged by leading atheist Bozarth .\nThis is why atheists regard indoctrinating children with millions of years and evolution to be so crucial ( see Summer in the enemy \u2019 s camp ) .\nIt is when Christians start to compromise on what the Scripture clearly says about the age of the earth that the whole thing crumbles into a heap ( see The slippery slide to unbelief for a tragic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put their trust in the reliable Word of God .\nThese themes are

?\nAnd not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart from your Father \u201d ( Matthew 10:29 ) .\nGod also takes ultimate responsibility for caring for the creatures .\nHe provides creatures with food and shelter .\nGod \u2019 s ownership of the world also means that He has authority to delegate ownership/stewardship to whomever He chooses .\nPaul says that God determined the boundaries of the dwelling place of the nations ( Acts 17:26 ) .\nTo understand the unique role God created humans to play , we have to go back to Genesis .\nDuring Creation Week , God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living things .\nBy part-way through Day 6 , there were fully functioning ecosystems , the foundations for symbiotic relationships between living things , and many beautiful and wonderfully designed creatures .\nWhat was missing was a physical inhabitant of the world who could commune with God and in some ways act as God \u2019 s representative on Earth .\nHumans are created in God \u2019 s image .\nWe know that God is a spirit with no physical body , so it doesn \u2019 t mean that we physically look like God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are like Him in certain ways .\nFor instance , we can think and reason , we have relationships with each other and God , and we are morally aware .\nThis resemblance to the Creator would have been much greater before the Fall , before humans were ruined by sin .\nBecause humans are created in God \u2019 s image , we are uniquely \u2018 qualified \u2019 to act as God \u2019 s stewards on the earth .\nWhen He created mankind , He said , \u201c And let them have dominion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth \u201d ( Genesis 1:26 ) .\nWhile both humans and the earth itself are affected by Adam \u2019 s fall into sin , this dominion mandate was never revoked .\nWhat does it mean to have dominion ?\nSimply put , it means that we \u2018 rule over \u2019 creation .\nAny action we take that affects the rest of creation is an expression of this dominion .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal for food , landscapes a garden , or digs an oil well , these are all various expressions of the dominion mandate .\nDoes this mean that we can do anything we want to creation ?\nNo , because God still retains ownership of it all .\nWe are only stewards with delegated authority , so we have to exercise this dominion within the bounds that God has set .\nHow do we determine these bounds ?\nIf we look at the expression of God \u2019 s ownership , while it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , He governs

, human stewardship of God \u2019 s creation should be in line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 undo \u2019 the effects of the Fall , such as healing disease , we should do so .\nAnd while we are given explicit permission to use creation for our good , such as eating plants and animals , we should not wantonly destroy creation in pursuing our own goals .\nThere are important limits to human stewardship .\nFirst , humanity \u2019 s control over the earth is not absolute like God \u2019 s .\nWe see this in God \u2019 s description of the creature Leviathan , and God \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human attempts to subdue it ( Job 41:1\u201310 ) .\nSecond , the dominion mandate does not extend to humanity .\nWhile God elsewhere establishes human government , nowhere does God give ownership of humans to other humans .\nMurder is a sin punishable by death , because humans are created in God \u2019 s image ( Genesis 9:6 ) .\nPeople who identify as environmentalists instinctively feel the call to be stewards of God \u2019 s creation because they are image-bearers who have the built-in instinct to take care of God \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is twisted by humanity \u2019 s sinful nature and divorced from the knowledge that God is the ultimate owner of creation , environmentalists can end up making some mistakes .\nFirst , people end up elevating animals to the level of humans , granting them rights and equal value alongside humans .\nWhile it is biblical to care about animals and not to needlessly kill or inflict suffering on them , we are explicitly given permission to own and eat animals .\nSecond , people end up devaluing human life , demoting humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are explicitly not given permission to exercise dominion over human life .\nSo any action that kills an innocent1 human being ,

heard it said , or said it yourself , \u201c Everywhere we look we see design.\n\u201d Obviously , one would fully expect believers in biblical creation , and advocates of Intelligent Design , to attest to design in the creation\u2014hence the many books and countless articles in magazines like Creation , journals , newspapers , and on the web , plus the plethora of videos on DVD and online .\nLiving things certainly look designed .\nSome people are surprised to learn that even well-known , militant atheists and evolutionists will admit this fact , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s hear first from British biologist Richard Dawkins : Director of The Skeptics Society ( US ) Michael Shermer agrees : So does American evolutionary biologist and Intelligent Design critic Jerry Coyne : In the above instances , Dawkins , Shermer , and Coyne had living organisms in mind .\nBut on a cosmic scale , too , top scientists affirm design .\nCharles Townes ( 1915\u20132015 ) , who shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1964 , unashamedly affirmed the universe was God-made : \u201c Intelligent design , as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , seems to be quite real .\nThis is a very special universe : it \u2019 s remarkable that it came out just this way .\nIf the laws of physics weren \u2019 t just the way they are , we couldn \u2019 t be here at all .\nThe sun couldn \u2019 t be there , the laws of gravity and nuclear laws and magnetic theory , quantum mechanics , and so on have to be just the way they are for us to be here.\n\u201d 5 So , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we observe design .\nThis being so , why is it that many people today seem unable ( or unwilling ) to accept the evidence of their eyes ?\nRecall that Richard Dawkins actually admits that \u201c a short cut to understanding \u201d living things is gained by assuming that they are designed\u2014even though he emphatically rejects that any designing intelligence was involved ; and certainly not the God of the Bible .\nHe is very insistent upon this point , but also inconsistent !\nAnd those who disagree with him\u2014who believe instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the design we see\u2014he calls deluded .\nOf course , not all atheists and sceptics go as far as Dawkins in their rhetoric .\nNevertheless , an increasing number of people in our secular society are buying into the lie that design denial is synonymous with ( even necessary for ) scientific integrity .\nThey are persuaded that design denial is an entirely sensible position .\n\u2018 Talk about design if you really must , but whatever you do , don \u2019 t bring God into the discussion.\n\u2019 That , they claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded of the line from Shakespeare \u2019 s Hamlet , \u201c The lady doth protest too much , methinks.\n\u201d 6 You can substitute \u201c lady \u201d with any spokesperson for the secular scientific establishment who claims that it is unscientific to follow the trail from designed things to the Designer\u2014a claim that is contrary to the Bible ( e.g .\nRomans 1:20 ) .\nNo , we really should follow where the scientific evidence leads us .\nWe have nothing to fear from facts , only fact-denying dogma .\nBeware of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @

of Oceania , in George Orwell \u2019 s dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four : \u201c The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears .\nIt was their final , most essential command.\n\u201d 7 Again , applying this to the evidence of design before our eyes , we say no .\nIf it looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and quacks like a duck\u2014it is most likely a duck .\nIf something looks designed , and the assumption of design will actually help our understanding of it , it is special pleading to claim that the \u2018 science \u2019 of Mother Nature , Lady Luck , and Father Time has made the Designer God redundant .\nIn recent years , new scientific evidence has not been kind to the idea that unguided natural selection and genetic mutations over deep time produces sophisticated design ( see \u2018 Evolution explains everything about life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are everywhere we care to look .\nIn making the point that Jesus was far greater than Moses , one Bible writer wisely affirmed , \u201c For every house is built by someone , but the builder of all things is God \u201d ( Hebrews 3:4 ) .\nThis is not the place to delve further into that passage , but don \u2019

this leads to a sort of cognitive dissonance , a conflict between two contradictory ideas\u2014as in , \u2018 it looks designed , let \u2019 s pretend it \u2019 s designed as it \u2019 ll help us

of science .\nIn The Psychology of Totalitarianism ( 2022 ) , Belgian professor of psychoanalysis ( Ghent University ) Mattias Desmet makes this pertinent observation : Of course , simply to talk about the might of the secular machine and shrug our shoulders achieves nothing .\nYet , in the face of such overwhelming odds , what can believers in biblical creation do ?\nWhat can we possibly hope to achieve ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge that \u201c the battle is the Lord \u2019 s \u201d ( 1 Samuel 17:47 ) \u2014that was the attitude of David ( although merely \u201c a youth \u201d , v. 33 ) in facing the Philistine giant Goliath .\nIt must be our attitude too .\nPrayer and reliance upon God is vital .\nSecondly , we must continue to take every opportunity to engage with people in the places where we find ourselves ; together we really can make a difference .\nThis might involve speaking up in conversations and sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of , giving people things to read or watch , sharing articles on social media , supporting or organising a creation-teaching event locally .\nImpossible odds ?\nRemember the words of Jesus , \u201c What is impossible with man is possible with God \u201d ( Luke 18:27 ) .\nChristians who take their stand on Genesis as history should take heart .\nIt may sound clich\u00e9d but it is still true : \u2018 One with God is a majority \u2019 ( consider 2 Kings 6:15\u201317 ) .\nThose who hold faithfully to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of Truth .\nOf course , people will continue to pay homage at the altar of Scientism .\nHowever , as a self-described humanist has acknowledged , \u201c Science is a blessing , but scientism is a curse \u2026 and peddles uncertainties \u2026 [ and ] transforms science into an ideology.\n\u201d 15 For this reason , as irrepressible as the evolutionary juggernaut may appear\u2014and even when its spokespersons have more qualifications and plaudits than you can shake a stick at\u2014its claims are actually baseless and unconvincing ( see Evolution \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider two final examples of the weaknesses in the secular juggernaut : influential scientists confessing their ignorance .\nThese commendable confessions expose the overly-confident origins claims by cult of \u2018 science \u2019 popularisers as blatant propaganda .\nFirst , consider this admission by internationally known physicist and science-writer Paul Davies in Scientific American .\nReferring to the alleged evolution of the first cell , he wrote : The second example is the recent admission by University of Kansas ( US ) astronomer Allison Kirkpatrick , upon realising that the new James-Webb space telescope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make existing big bang ideas obsolete.17 Ten times more disc-shaped galaxies were seen than predicted , meaning that modellers must rethink how quickly star formation occurred after the alleged big bang .\nKirkpatrick says : Returning to the title and opening words of this article , secular evolutionary philosophy may seem to be a hugely powerful , overwhelming force , with many \u2018 cult of science \u2019 devotees , but it is not unstoppable .\nBiblical creationists need to inform and equip themselves with the scientific facts ( uncomfortable to evolutionists ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confessions of leading evolutionary protagonists .\nPrayerfully sharing such things with people can be a useful pre-evangelistic strategy , sometimes winning yourself the opportunity to share faith in Christ .\nContrary to Bill Nye , nobody is an \u201c insignificant \u2026 speck \u201d .\nRather , all are made in God \u2019 s image and in need of His forgiveness and salvation .", "author": "", "url": "https://creation.com/a/12132", "published": "Thu, 15 Dec 2022 05:00:00 +1300", "published_utc":

Line , Jeffrey Tomkins , and Daniel Biddle BP Books , Tulsa , OK , 2020 This recently published book is a one-volume encyclopedia of claims of human evolution , and is quite detailed and fairly technical .\nBesides examining the standard extinct primates that are enlisted as part of evolutionary scenarios , it also focuses on seldom-considered factors that separate humans from non-human primates , both in terms of biology and behaviour .\nIn addition , this work offers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homo sapiens is noticeably different from the likes of Homo erectus and Neanderthal Man , and relates these differences to the teachings in the Bible .\nThe authors Bergman , Line , Biddle , and Tomkins , are well qualified to examine questions related to presumed human evolution .\nBergman , Line , and Tomkins have strong backgrounds in anatomy and physiology , and Peter Line has a strong background in neurobiology .\nTheir analysis of the paleonthropological literature is exhaustive .\nThe \u2018 pre-human \u2019 specimens found so far are far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Most claimed fossil ape-men finds consist of a few teeth plus pieces of broken skull and other bone fragments \u201d ( p. 26 ) .\nFor instance , \u2018 Turkana boy \u2019 ( usually assigned to Homo erectus ) is exceptional in that its skeleton is 40 % complete .\nThe much-hyped australopithecine Lucy is fragmentary , and only 20 % complete by skeletal weight ( Bergman and Biddle , p. 104 ) .\nThe habiline KNM-ER 1470 is notorious for its fragmentary character , leading to ever-changing reconstructions and ensuing interpretations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHomo erectus is difficult to evaluate because of the rarity of postcranial elements , especially those that can unambiguously be linked to the crania ( Line , p. 246 ) .\nSome of the taxons are each a \u2018 wastebasket \u2019 .\nThe understanding of extinct primates , and their presumed role in the evolution of humans , is complicated by the fact that some of the names used are , or may be , an amalgamation of skeletal remains of different animals , and even of nonhumans and humans .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called Australopithecus sediba ( Editors , p. 3 , Peter Line , p. 134 ) and Homo habilis ( Peter Line , p. 198 ) .\nThe latter is an admixture of australopithecines , Homo erectus , and the skeletal remains of oddball extinct primates of unclear affinities .\nIn addition , the presence of nearby tools influences the naming of specimens ( e.g .\nhabilis ) , even though the identity of the toolmakers can not be proved .\nIn addition , toolmaking , even if it could unambiguously be linked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of \u2018 human-ness \u2019 than previously supposed .\nWe now know that chimps make and use tools of varying sophistication , but this of course does not make them any more human-like .\nThe conventional evolutionary scenario is as follows : The australopithecines were succeeded by Homo habilis , which in turn was succeeded by Homo erectus and then Homo sapiens .\nPaleoanthropologist Bernard Wood rejects this simple unilineal model of human evolution , basing his conclusion on both fossil morphology and evolutionary dating methods ( Peter Line , p. 201 ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute cranial capacity , the inferring of language function from skeletal elements , and the inferring of the ability of precision gripping ( Line , p. 173 ) .\nDiffering interpretations of newly discovered skeletal elements are common .\nFor instance , evolutionists disagree on whether Oreopithecus was bipedal ( Line , p. 92 ) .\nLet us take a closer look at cranial capacity .\nEvolutionists see the crude trend towards greater cranial capacity , in the inferred lineage leading to humans , as evidence of increase in intelligence with time .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern humans , there is a wide range of cranial capacities , and that such cranial capacity has no relationship to intelligence .\nThey get around this paradox that they had created by claiming ad hoc that cranial capacity was once associated with intelligence , but no longer is .\nThis is special pleading with a vengeance !\n( Line , pp .\n242\u2013244 ) .\nLet us consider closely-related traits .\nIt should be noted that there is an unexpected considerable overlap , in cranial-vault thickness , of Homo erectus and modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 pre-human \u2019 primates Evolutionists and the media put much hype into claims that ( inferred ) bipedality in certain extinct primates means that this alone makes them quite \u2018 human-like \u2019 .\nIt does not .\nIn actuality , extinct primates fill in a lot of morphospace that is left empty by only considering today \u2019 s apes and humans .\nIt is therefore not surprising that some \u2018 human \u2019 traits ( such as bipedality ) , so designated because they are found only in extant humans but not in extant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nConsistent with this fact , Oreopithecus , Rudapithecus , and Danavius appear to exhibit a type of bipedalism , even though no evolutionist considers them closely related to humans , or on the evolutionary path to humans .\nMoreover , their bipedalism , according to the evolutionistic timescale , precedes the first hominids by several million years ( Peter Line , pp .\n92\u201393 ) .\nFrom an evolutionary point of view , they can be seen as early evolutionary \u2018 experiments \u2019 in primate bipedalism , but they reduce the presumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFrom a creationist viewpoint , the sheer variety of quasi-bipedal extinct primates bespeaks a common phenomenon among extinct primates , and not something special that occurs only in those extinct primates enlisted to support evolutionary scenarios .\nPutative non-human primate bipedalism is also theologically irrelevant .\nPeter Line comments : \u201c The Bible does not address the issue of locomotion in primates , and so , from a creation viewpoint , if bipedal ape-like primates existed , it does not contradict Scripture \u201d ( Peter Line , p. 91 ) .\nHow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homo Differing interpretations often cloud the picture .\nFor instance , Neanderthal Man was originally portrayed as brutish and stooped-over , consistent with ruling evolutionistic preconceptions .\nNow we know better ( Bergmann , p. 280 ) .\nSome of the distinctions in taxonomic classification of Homo are based on circular reasoning .\nConsider the Xuchung , China , crania , which are large-brained but otherwise very similar to classic Homo erectus .\nLine comments : So part of the differences , as between Homo erectus and Homo sapiens , are artifacts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erectus , Homo neanderthalensis , Homo heidelbergensis , and which to Homo sapiens .\nIn addition , what counts as a difference largely depends on how uncommon a feature has to be in today \u2019 s Homo sapiens , compared to its abundance in Homo erectus , in order to be counted as a difference ( Line , p. 229 ) .\nThere is also the factor of time .\nConsider the Willandra Lakes hominids of Australia .\nThey are dated , according to evolutionary dating methods , to only 12,000 to 30,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the evolutionary timescale .\nYet they look astonishingly similar to much , much older Homo erectus specimens ( Line , p. 237 ) .\nSo what are they ?\nA creationist explanation for the differences in the genus Homo Consider the implications of the likelihood that almost all the forms assigned to genus Homo are of one species .\nIf Homo erectus , Neanderthals , and modern humans are just racial variants of each other , why are they different from each other , and why especially are modern humans different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To begin with , Peter Line writes : Other factors that could explain at least some of the differences in ancient and modern Homo are diseases in fossil organisms .\nThese diseases include microcephaly and cretinism .\nHumans and chimps are in no sense \u2018 almost the same \u2019 Books such as The Naked Ape ( figure 1 ) have promoted and reinforced the notion that humans and chimps are astonishingly similar to each other .\nThey are not .\nTomkins and Bergman ( p. 58 ) point out that chimps and humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be transplanted to humans , that chimps can not read and write , and that chimps do not bury their dead or conduct funerals .\nHumans can convey over 1,000 different facial expressions , as against less than a dozen in chimps ( Bergman , p. 33 ) .\nEven the \u2018 nakedness \u2019 of the \u2018 naked ape \u2019 is ironic in a way .\nAmong primates , humans have a unique dearth of body hair , and evolutionists have a myriad of conflicting hypotheses as they try to account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 44 ) .\nLet us now focus on genomic characteristics .\nThe much-hyped evolutionistic claim that the DNA of humans and chimps is 98 % identical , is false .\nIt turns out that this is based on a comparison of only already-similar DNA sequences in both genomes .\nWhen the entire DNA sequence of both is compared , the number drops to 81\u201384 % ( Tomkins and Bergman , p. 61 ) .\nBut all this is academic : similarities and differences in DNA may be a foundation of sensationalistic evolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell us very little about the relative capabilities of different creatures .\nThe venerable creationist Duane T. Gish once pointed out that clouds are 100 % water and watermelons are 98 % water , but that hardly means that both are essentially the same .\nNow consider chromosome structure .\nOf all the chimp and human chromosomes , two chimp chromosomes are inferred , by evolutionists , to have fused to form one corresponding chromosome in humans .\nIn actuality , the corresponding similarities between the human-chimp chromosomes are doubtful , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ibid , pp .\n63\u201364 ) .\nWhat about genes ?\nThere are thousands of genes found in humans but not found in chimps , and thousands of genes found in chimps but not humans .\nThese are called \u2018 orphan genes \u2019 ( ibid , p. 66 ) .\nHuman evolution continues to be beset with problems , such as fragmentary and incomplete remains , indefinite taxa , and over-interpretation .\nThese problems add up , as elaborated by retired biologist Willard Lake : The differences between modern and ancient Homo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be explicable by such things as differences in aging soon after the Flood .\nHowever , owing to the fact that some of these differences occur among juveniles , the differences in modern and ancient Homo must also include a difference in the timing of development , and not simply a longer lifespan for early-post-Flood man .\nAll this should definitively be further explored as part of a more comprehensive creation model .", "author": "", "url": "https://creation.com/a/14651", "published": "Fri, 16 Dec 2022 05:00:00 +1300", "published_utc": 1671184800, "collection_utc": 1671232257}, {"id":

\u2019 s renewed faith .\nBut it is still worthwhile to address his expressed doubts .\nKeaton Halley replied : I see that Gavin Cox has replied to you a few times previously , and since you have sent in two new submissions , I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI \u2019 m so glad to hear that you say that you have \u201c now returned to God \u201d !\nHopefully that means you have fully trusted in Christ to forgive your sins and reconcile you to your Maker .\nI will share this with Gavin so he can rejoice with you and know that his responses were helpful to you .\nI \u2019 ll also chime in with my own thoughts about your earlier question , regarding how God can separate light from darkness .\nNotice that the light is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named \u2018 Night \u2019 , according to Genesis 1:5 .\nThis suggests that what God created is not merely physical light , but the period in which there is daylight on earth , and the night period which is characterized by darkness .\nBefore God created the light and separated it from the darkness , it would have been perpetual darkness ( Genesis 1:2 ) .\nThe separation means that light and dark would each have its own time period during which it is present for a local observer on Earth , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .\nThus , in my understanding , God made this cyclical time separation of light and dark periods that make up a day , not a physical spatial division of things formerly mixed or intermingled .\nHopefully that helps to further alleviate your difficulty with the creation account .\nBut let me give some brief responses to the other doubts you expressed .\n\u2022 Regarding Hell , I \u2019 m not sure why you said it seemed unreasonable .\nWe have addressed this concern in several articles like : Is God unjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor reasons to reject Christianity , and Hell questions answered .\nYou also mentioned Christianity being \u201c exclusionary \u201d , but if you meant that it claims other perspectives are wrong , this is unavoidable for any worldview .\nEven if pluralism were right ( that all paths lead to \u2018 God \u2019 ) , that would mean that all exclusivist views ( that there \u2019 s only one way ) are wrong !\nBut more likely you meant that salvation through Christ excludes those who don \u2019 t place their faith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Jesus is the only one who solved the problem !\nHe died for our sins so that we could be forgiven and be reconciled to our Creator .\nOther religious figures did not do this .\nThis is why the Bible says \u201c there is salvation in no one else , for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.\n\u201d It is actually a tremendous grace that God saves sinners , and God isn \u2019 t unfair to punish anyone since the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserve it .\nIndeed , everyone deserves it , but God has made a way for us to escape judgment through Christ .\n\u2022 Regarding no righteous people in Noah \u2019 s day , why should this be hard to believe ?\nNone of us are really righteous apart from Christ .\nWe might look clean on the outside to people who have a fairly low standard for what constitutes goodness .\nBut by God \u2019 s standard of perfection , none of us are truly good .\nJesus himself said there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nAnd apart from God \u2019 s restraining hand , it \u2019 s easy for society to descend into moral chaos .\nJust look at the present state of the world !\nIf we view things from God \u2019 s righteous perspective , people in general are very wicked , and encourage one another to do evil .\n\u2022 Regarding OT laws , I \u2019 m not sure why they seemed to you to be merely human constructs .\nThe law about damaged testicles and the priesthood illustrates that God \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing inherently morally wrong in having damaged testicles , God required that a person who suffered such an injury should not serve as a priest , perhaps in order to illustrate a biblical truth about God \u2019 s holiness or our need for a perfect intermediary .\nI don \u2019 t see why that would be inappropriate .\nThere is no moral principle that required God to allow all people to be eligible for the Levitical priesthood .\nIt wasn \u2019 t a human right but a special calling .\n\u2022 You also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying believer \u201d , but here I think you \u2019 ve just misunderstood the meaning of the text .\nWhen the Bible says that a liar won \u2019 t go to heaven , it implicitly means an unredeemed liar .\nIf someone puts his faith in Christ , he may still commit the sin of lying , but he won \u2019 t be characterized by that sin .\nHe will be seen as pure in God \u2019 s sight , because Jesus paid for that sin .\nGod judicially bestows on believers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 Corinthians 1:30 ) .\nBut if the Bible as God \u2019 s Word is rejected , on what basis is human value derived ?\n\u2022 You seem to have difficulty with the idea that the Bible is completely trustworthy .\nBut a biblical worldview makes far better sense of the evidence before us than any other worldview .\nIt is the Bible that tells us human beings are all equally valuable , for example , being made in God \u2019 s image .\nBut if the Bible as God \u2019 s Word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human value derived ?\nSee The positive case for creation for more examples .\nSo , it is important to compare Christianity with the alternatives , and not just consider difficulties you have with Christianity in isolation .\nSee Confident Christianity and Nagging doubts for more on this point .\nThen , if you do come to the conclusion that the Bible is necessary to make sense of significant aspects of human experience , then it only makes sense to embrace the Bible as error-free .\nThis is because it claims to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God said these things ) , and God does not make mistakes .\nIf you encounter Bible passages that you find difficult , you can address them on a case-by-case basis .\nBut if you reject the Bible \u2019 s inerrancy , it is important to realize that this has drastic and far-reaching effects .\nYour view of reality has already been shaped by Christianity in countless ways that you probably haven \u2019 t even recognized .\nFor more reasoning along these lines , I \u2019 d encourage you to read Glen Scrivener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breathe .\n\u2022 You say Christians can \u2019 t move mountains as Jesus claimed in Matthew 17:20 .\nWell , I think on this occasion Jesus was speaking non-literally .\nIt \u2019 s most likely an example of hyperbole\u2014using exaggeration for the sake of emphasis .\nOf course , I think the One who Created all things could easily move mountains and give His followers the ability to perform such miracles if He wanted .\nBut I don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s what God literally wants since He acts with purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhat would be the point of throwing a mountain into the sea ?\nIt would not advance God \u2019 s kingdom .\nTo say that we can move mountains is a way of saying that we can do really incredible things with just a little faith in God ( such as , in context , casting out demons ) .\nAnd I do think Christians have moved mountains in that metaphorical sense .\nThink of William Wilberforce \u2019 s efforts to abolish the slave trade , for example .\nThat mountain was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark 9:1 didn \u2019 t happen .\nBut it did , since the very next verse begins to tell how these words were fulfilled only six days later .\nJesus \u2019 inner circle watched him transfigured before them , and this is almost certainly what He meant when He said they would see the Kingdom of God come with power .\nTheologians often talk about how the Kingdom of God is both \u2018 already \u2019 here and \u2018 not yet \u2019 here in its fullness .\nBut the context of this verse helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , you said miracles like Joshua \u2019 s long day \u201c sound like fables \u201d , but this is only if you have a bias against the miraculous .\nIf you had searched our website , you could have read the article Joshua \u2019 s long day , which offers insight on this subject .\nScripture does not record how God performed this feat of making the sun and moon appear to stand still in the sky .\nIt was a miracle so , by definition , we can not give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however of what God may have done , including a localised refraction of light .\nIf God decided to stop ( or slow ) Earth spinning on its axis , He could also have simultaneously prevented catastrophes like tsunamis from resulting , and stopped everyone ( and everything ) on Earth \u2019 s surface from being \u201c launched \u201d at 1,000 mph ( horizontally ) .\nBy the way , it \u2019 s only at the equator that objects are moving at 1,000 mph , not at every latitude .\nThe article further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space ( vertically ) either .\nYou also stated : \u201c No orbit , the Moon would crash to Earth.\n\u201d Presumably you mean here the Moon \u2019 s orbit around Earth ?\nBut most of the Moon \u2019 s apparent motion in the sky is caused by Earth \u2019 s rotation , so I don \u2019 t know that God would have needed to stop the Moon \u2019 s revolution too .\nAssuming He did , however , this was a miracle too , so God could also have supplied the necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being gravitationally pulled toward Earth .\n( It would take more than a day for the Moon to reach Earth anyway . )\nRemember , miracles are supernatural , so it is not merely natural causes and effects at work .\nGod is all-powerful and can do whatever He pleases within His creation as long as there is no logical contradiction .\nSee Miracles and science .\nAgain , it \u2019 s great to hear that God has already been working in you even since you sent in this series of questions .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered will continue to strengthen your walk with the Lord .\nPostscript : Afterward , Brendon sent yet another encouraging note .\nYou \u2019 ve just been an answer to my prayers .\nTo be honest I was flip-flopping between wanting to believe and not , and still not fully convinced about the \u201c separation \u201d of light from dark

interesting would tempt me to finish off the loaded film .\nWalking along the beach , I noticed where the high tide and waves during the night had eroded sand from the beach ( Photo 1 ) .\nTo my

layering was present along the whole sand mass exposed .\nLayers which look similar to these are often believed to be evidence for huge periods of time .\nFor example , they may be interpreted as being the result of periodic floods depositing material .\nIn some rocks there are pairs of dark and light layers which are regarded as the material deposited in annual floods .\nIn such a concept , material is washed into a lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fine material settling after the coarse , giving one pair of bands of fine and coarse material for each flood .\nIf it happened this way , and there are thousands of laminations , this would represent thousands of years of floods .\nUsing this sort of reasoning , such rocks can be assigned ages of many millions of years .\nHowever , many

instantaneously in rapidly flowing water.2 The type of lamination\u2014whether it was fine on coarse or coarse on fine\u2014depended on the relative density and size of the particles .\nHow did the

lose sand , apparently because of breakwaters built to protect the Tweed River mouth for shipping purposes .\nThese breakwaters stop the natural drift of sand northward to the Gold Coast beaches ,

was pumped ashore as a water/sand slurry through a large pipe to the beach .\nAs the sand was restored to one section of beach , the pipe was extended by sections to supply sand to the next section of beach ( see the diagram below , which shows the ship , the pipe to the beach and slurry discharge on the beach ) .\nAccording to Dr Tom Conner of Kinhill , Cameron and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project , the ship carried 8,000 cubic metres of sand at a time .\nIt took only an hour to pump the sand to the beach in a slurry of approximately 30 per cent sand and 70 per cent water .\nThis amounts to over 400,000 litres of water and sand ( equivalent to about 10 private swimming pools of water ) per minute .\nThis created what Dr Conner described as quite a fast flowing little \u2018 river \u2019 back towards the sea , with the sand being deposited as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand was deposited in quite a fast-flowing , turbulent environment .\nThe amount of sand pumped in one hour is enough to cover a football field to well over a metre deep .\nThe sections in the photographs would have been formed in less than an hour , since the area covered at one time was much less than a football field in size .\nGuy Berthault and his co-workers , in their controlled experiments with flow tanks , were able to obtain layering like this using particles with different sizes\u2014here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as different sizes .\nIt appears that there are different ways to get many alternating bands of layering rapidly , without millions of years .\nMany evolutionist geologists would themselves acknowledge this , if pressed .\nIn any case , the idea that thousands of perfectly formed laminations can form slowly and gradually has other problems .\nFor example , how does a lamination on a lake bottom from a flood remain undisturbed for many months until the next flood comes to deposit the next lamination ?\nOne would expect that biological activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat laminations , which , in the Green River Formation in the United States , for example , average only about 0.1 millimetre thick .\nEach such thin lamination is supposed to have remained undisturbed for about a year before the next influx of sediment was deposited on top .\nAlso , there are many fish beautifully preserved as fossils in the Green River rocks\u2014how could this happen with a mere 0.1 millimetre per year of sediment being deposited ?\nThere is now ample evidence that fine layering and laminations can form rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one could expect during various phases of the biblical Flood.3",

Jesus is the Creator ( John 1:3 ; Colossians 1:16 ) , and He has revealed His Word to us ( John 1:1 ) so we can understand what God did and when .\nHowever , all of this puts Christians like me on a collision course with an increasingly godless society .\nNot easy being the minority Now , if being a biblically minded Christian puts me in the minority,1 how much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavens and the earth were created just over 6,000 years ago , with the entire planet being inundated over 16 centuries later .\nAfter this , I believe there was a dispersion of the people by language at the Tower of Babel .\nOver the years , I have grown quite used to raised eye-brows and surprised smiles when I share my beliefs .\nFor instance , consider the issue of climate change .\nThese days , we are bombarded with news that , not only is the Earth \u2019 s temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is the major cause of it ( Anthropogenic Global Warming\u2014AGW ) , leading to all sorts of alarmist headlines .\nIt is interesting to note that people who believe in the Earth being billions of years old , often admit that radical temperature swings occurred in the distant past , long before any people were around !\nWith climate change and all the other debates and controversies we face in our world today , it is pertinent for people to put their critical thinking hats on .\nThis does not mean to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; rather , it should encourage civilised dialogue with the aim of arriving at the truth .\nPeople are still free to choose to believe otherwise , but how much better for that choice to be an informed one .\nShutting out other opinions is not conducive to good science , and neither does it make a great society ; instead , it divides people and even communities .\nSo , being in a minority can be challenging .\nIt \u2019 s not easy going against the tide .\nBut I would rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go with the flow .\nSpeaking the truth sometimes means people suffer the consequences Notice that being in the majority does not mean life is a walk in the park either .\nPeople who may be in the majority most of the time can still find themselves uncomfortably in the

sex.4 But many want to deprive us of the right to say that anymore , even privately .\nIt \u2019 s political correctness gone mad , but again we observe that the minority who would dare to voice that

Genesis , the Bible routinely records human lifespans which seem outrageously different from our experience today .\nAdam lived to 930 years ; Noah even longer , to 950 years ( see graph below ) .\nThese long lifespans are not haphazardly distributed ; they are systematically greater before the Flood of Noah , and decline sharply afterwards .\nThese great ages are not presented in the Bible as if they are in any way extraordinary for their times , let alone miraculous .\nMany people are quick to scoff at such ages , claiming they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if they avoid all fatal diseases , humans will generally die of old age before they reach much past 100 .\nEven the very exceptional cases don \u2019 t make it much past 120 years .\nHowever , a look at the evidence related to aging suggests that the apparent upper limit on today \u2019 s average lifespans is not something that is \u2018 biologically inevitable \u2019 as such for humans or other multi-celled creatures .\nDisease , diet , \u2018 wear and tear \u2019 and other environmental factors undoubtedly play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHowever , it now appears that underlying all these are factors somehow written into our genetic code , which determine what our \u2018 upper limit \u2019 is .\nThis is not really surprising ; most of us know of families in which nearly everyone lives to a ripe old age\u2014and the opposite , of course .\nAnd although an average \u2018 upper limit \u2019 seems to be \u2018 programmed \u2019 into each species , breeding experiments have shown that this limit can be altered , even dramatically .\nExperiments with fruitflies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bred into and out of these populations .\nSo you can have two populations of the same fly , with one group living many times longer than the other , on average .\nEven a genetic \u2018 switch \u2019 involved in longevity has been identified in one species of worm .\nIn the 1960s , a middle-aged lawyer in France struck a deal with a lady client in her 90s , as follows .\nHe gained ownership of her apartment , in return for a handsome monthly stipend .\nShe could live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seemed an obvious win-win ; because of her advanced age , he would surely end up with a very cheap purchase , and she would live out her meagre allotment of remaining years with a high income .\nTo the lawyer \u2019 s great misfortune , his client , Jeanne Calment , was destined to become the longest living person in modern history .\nShe died in 1997 ( with all faculties intact ) at the age of 122 years , 164 days .\nHer lawyer died of old age long before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate ) ended up paying her the price of her apartment many times over .\nTwo French researchers have recently traced Calment \u2019 s genealogy back five generations on both sides .\nEach of her ancestors had lived a remarkable 10.5 years longer , on average , than the mean age at death of people in the same region .\nThey concluded that how she lived or what she ate was not the main factor in her great age , but that a rare constellation of longevity genes must have come together in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to avoid any misfortune which might have caused earlier death .\nThis is consistent with our thesis here there are genetic longevity factors .\nThe availability of a great array of these in our pre-Flood ancestors might well explain their long lifespans , while loss of some could explain the subsequent drop .\nWhy do we wear out ?\nWhy is it that multi-celled creatures ( like people ) all eventually wear out and die ?\nIt is not enough to simply say that there are physical laws which dictate that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is true , but biological machinery has built-in \u2018 intelligence \u2019 ( programmed into the DNA ) which gives it the ability to repair itself .\nWhy don \u2019 t these cells keep on dividing , repairing and renewing the organ forever ?\nThat \u2019 s why single-celled creatures like bacteria don \u2019 t die of old

they can reproduce by budding and don \u2019 t exhibit obvious senescence ( aging to death ) \u201d . ]\nBeings like us have organs ( e.g.\n, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are made up of lots of individual cells .\nWhy don \u2019 t these cells keep on dividing , repairing and renewing the organ forever ?\nIf this were to happen , with worn-out cells replaced by newly manufactured ones , then none of your \u2018 parts \u2019 would wear out .\nWhich of course means that you would never wear out .\nYou might be killed by a falling tree , or die of some infection , but you would never die of old age .\nOf course , this isn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do wear out .\nThe cells within them can multiply for a while , but not forever .\nAfter a certain number of times , they simply stop dividing .\nIt is known that ordinary human cells will only divide some 80\u201390 times , then no more .\nIt appears that there is , on the tips of each of our chromosomes , a structure called a telomere .\nThink of it as a counting device , with a number of beads on the end .\nEvery time the cell divides , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , shortening the telomere ( see section below ) .1 Once all of the beads have gone , cell division can no longer take place .\nFrom then on , as each cell \u2018 runs down \u2019 , it is not replaced by any new ones .\nSo even if you avoid any sort of fatal accident or disease , you will eventually succumb to failure of one or more organs .\nThe machinery by which cells divide is controlled by the instructions written on the DNA , the genetic code .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetic limit , while not all there is to aging , could well be a big part of the story .\nIn short , there is no known biological reason why lifespans of 900 years or more would be impossible if that genetic limit were set at a different point .\nAnd there is reason to think that there could indeed be great variation in this genetic \u2018 upper limit \u2019 .\nWe have already seen that simply reshuffling gene frequencies through breeding selection in fruitflies can drastically increase their lifespan .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could they possibly live for so long ?\n\u2019 , but rather , \u2018 Why don \u2019 t we live that long any more ?\n\u2019 Looking at the drop in lifespans after the Flood , it is natural to think that it must be related to the world having changed so drastically .\nEvidence from the fossil record does suggest that carbon dioxide ( also possibly oxygen ) levels were higher in the pre-Flood world .\nMany have suggested that an atmospheric canopy of water vapour sheltered the pre-Flood world from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this were so [ CW 2022 : since this article was first published the canopy theory has been abandoned by CMI and virtually all major creationist scientists\u2014see Arguments not to use ] , there is little evidence that aging is substantially influenced by any of these factors .\nThe idea that the environment became so much more \u2018 toxic \u2019 after the Flood as to slash our lifespans by nearly eight centuries , to one-ninth of what they were , stumbles at one important point .\nNoah was already over 600 years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut this allegedly much more hostile environment did not cause him to rapidly wither and die in a few decades .\nInstead , he lived for another 350 years , outstripping the age of even his ancestor Adam .\nWe don \u2019 t know whether environmental factors perhaps only cause problems in the developmental phase of human life .\nHowever , one simple explanation of why Noah still lived for so long is that Noah \u2019 s genetic make-up was what gave him the potential to live so long .\nAnd that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people before the Flood were programmed for much longer lifespans than we are programmed for today .\nSo what happened ?\nRemember that the whole population shrank to just a handful .\nThere are well known ways in which forms of genes ( known as alleles ) , which could include any coding for longer lifespans , can be eliminated from a population that has gone through such a \u2018 bottleneck \u2019 \u2014down to eight people ( see box ) .\nIf such genetic loss were the reason for the decline in lifespans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one .\nHarmful mutations accumulating at higher rates may have played a part .\nSome of these mutations may have caused a loss of the length of the telomere , for instance .\n[ CW 2022 : Years after this article was published , Dr John Sanford \u2019 s landmark work on genetic entropy has focused even greater attention on the high likelihood that mutational accumulation is a key factor\u2014perhaps even the key factor\u2014in the declining patriarchal ages , which are a good fit to a mathematical decay curve , see The rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Flood , the variety of plants available for food was drastically reduced , perhaps one reason why God permitted man to eat meat at that point .\nHowever , not even the most avid enthusiast for healthy eating would suggest that , by simply changing our diet , we could live for 950 years today .\nPerhaps some of these other factors are the reason for the continuing decline , lasting for centuries .\nIsaac lived to 180 , Moses 120 , King David only 71 years .\nInterestingly , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to environmental factors .\nHowever , I think it is likely that to live anywhere near as long as our ancestor Noah , we would need some of his genetic factors .\nOf course , the ultimate reason for all aging and death is the Curse on all creation recorded in Genesis chapter 3 .\nAdam was told that if he disobeyed God , \u2018 dying , you shall die \u2019 [ lit .\nHebrew ] .\nAdam immediately died spiritually , and began to die physically on the very same day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nModern genetic research shows that we all inherit the inevitability of aging and death .\nWhen we look at our encroaching wrinkles in the mirror , it should remind us of the awfulness of sin in the sight of a holy God .\nAnd it should cause us immense thankfulness that God has provided a way of escape from His own righteous judgement on sin , through His Son , the Lord Jesus Christ .\nGenetic loss after the Flood\u2014a cause for dropping lifespans ?\nThere is a well-known and simple phenomenon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which varying forms ( alleles ) of genes ( stretches of DNA coding for various characteristics ) can become lost in small populations .\nGenes come in pairs ; you inherit one from your mother and one from your father .\nIn the example shown above diagrammatically , the \u2018 G \u2019 form of the gene is present in father and not in mother .\nEach of their children only has a 50\u201350 chance of inheriting the \u2018 G \u2019 version of that particular gene , as shown .\nTherefore the possibility that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gene is not at all a remote one .\n( If they only have three children , the chance is 1 in 8 ) .\nIn a situation in which the entire human race was reduced down to Noah , his three sons and their wives , it is entirely feasible that some forms of the genes present in Noah were not passed on .\nSince it now appears that much of aging is under genetic control , loss of some of the genes for longevity may be the reason for the drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Babel ) contributed further to this genetic elimination.2 The \u2018 capping \u2019 at the end of each chromosome ( called a telomere , from Greek \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 telos = \u2018 end \u2019 and \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 mer\u03bfs \u2018 part \u2019 ) is , like the capped tips of shoelaces , necessary to prevent the ends fraying .\nThe telomere shortens with each cell division\u2014once the limit is reached , the cells can no longer divide .\nThis is probably only one way in which our limited lifespans are \u2018 programmed \u2019 into us .\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people could not live much longer than they do at present , if they had the appropriate genetic makeup .\nIt has long been known that there are human cells that can keep on dividing forever\u2014cancer cells .\nThese appear not to have the built-in \u2018 switch \u2019 which tells cells to stop dividing , so they keep on making copies of themselves .\nThis is why medical labs , which need to use human cell lines in their work , can be continually supplied with cells which are all the \u2018 offspring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer .\n( Called HeLa cells , after Henrietta Lacks , the lady whose cancer it was ) .\nThe HeLa cell line is effectively \u2018 immortal \u2019 ( unless existing HeLa cells were to all be

divided many times past their limit .\nSome speculate that such manipulations could cause people to live to much longer ages , providing they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the meantime .\nAging is certain to be

uncovered graphic evidence of the deadly terror unleashed on a herd of dinosaurs as they were buried under sediment by the rising waters of Noah \u2019 s Flood in western Inner Mongolia ( figure 1 ) .1 Dinosaur bones were first discovered at the site , located at the base of a small hill in the Gobi Desert , in 1978 by a Chinese geologist .\nAfter about 20 years , a team of Chinese and Japanese scientists recovered the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning \u201c Chinese bird mimic \u201d .\nA few years later in 2001 , the international team excavated the remains of more than 25 dinosaurs , creating a large quarry in the process as they followed the skeletons into the base of the hill .\nAs the team carefully mapped the location of the bones and strata that contained them ( figure 2 ) , it became clear that the dinosaurs were all within the same layer of mudstone ( i.e .\nthe same bedding plane ) , generally facing the same direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinosaurs were buried in a life-like crouching posture and , even more surprisingly , the limbs of the dinosaurs were plunging down into the underlying mud as deep as 40 cm ( figure 3 ) .3 Their hind legs were often still bent indicating that they were struggling to escape .\nTwo of the skeletons were found one right over the other where they apparently fell .\nThis fossil find captures in stone how the dinosaurs perished when they became mired in the mud .\nThe thick layer of mud in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted and convoluted4 indicating that the sediment was only recently deposited from flowing water and still soft when it was disturbed .\nThere was an absence of bioturbation ( such as burrowing by worms or crustaceans ) in the underlying mud,5 which also indicated that the mud was only recently deposited .\nNot only was the thick under layer of sediment recently deposited , but the overlying sediments were deposited soon after the animals were trapped , burying the animals before their soft parts had a chance to rot away .\nNearly all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drab , blue-gray halo indicating how far the soft tissue extended ( figure 3 ) , and that the carcasses had decomposed after being buried , not before .\nIn addition , gastroliths ( stomach stones ) were found in the fossilized ribcages of some animals , as well as carbonized stomach contents ( figure 3 ) .6 So promptly were the animals buried that the delicate bones in the eye ( sclerotic rings ) of some animals were preserved .\nThe team interpreted the site as a \u201c catastrophic miring of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a large herd of animals being frantically trapped in thick mud that was only recently deposited and then rapidly buried by more sediment I immediately think of Noah \u2019 s Flood .\nThe fossil evidence is exactly the sort of thing that you would expect as a result of the global catastrophe described in the Bible .\nHowever , Noah \u2019 s Flood is not an explanation that came to the minds of the paleontologists who excavated the dinosaurs in Inner Mongolia .\nConsequently , they struggled to explain what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were looking for a modern environment that corresponds with the evidence but Noah \u2019 s Flood was a unique event.7 There has been no geological disaster in the last 4,500 years that has come anywhere close to what happened during the Flood .\nLead author , David Varricchio , assistant professor of paleontology at Montana State University , USA , indicated his surprise at what the team uncovered and alluded to their inability to explain it with a modern environment .\n\u201c Finding a mired herd is exceedingly rare among living animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the paleontologists encountered is that according to uniformitarianism the fossils layers preserve a living environment that existed at that time .\nTherefore , the team was surprised that the dinosaurs consisted only of juveniles without any adults or hatchlings present .\nHowever , that is perfectly understandable in the Flood catastrophe when animals were fleeing .\nYou would expect the hatchlings to have already perished and the adults to have fled and abandoned the youngsters .\nIn scientific circles these sorts of anomalies are never reported as a problem .\nRather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a \u201c new discovery \u201d .\nThey said it was evidence of \u201c distinctive dinosaur sociality \u201d where the immature dinosaurs were left to fend for themselves in juvenile herds while the mature adults were occupied elsewhere with parental care of eggs and hatchlings .\nWhat an amazing story .\nAnother problem for the team was the thickness of the mud in which the dinosaurs were trapped .\nThey suggested the area was a low energy lake environment , which is the standard interpretation that uniformitarians invoke to explain muddy sediments .\nHowever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an automatic interpretation is almost certainly incorrect because mud readily deposits from flowing water.8 In order to account for the depth of mud in an area where the animals could be trapped the team claimed the water level of the lake was lowering as a result of drought .\nThat could account for the mud depth in a limited region close to the shore .\nBut it is hard to imagine how , under normal conditions , so many animals could have become trapped together so suddenly in a small area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt is also hard to account for the absence of bioturbation in the mud .\nIf you say that worms and crustaceans had not colonized the sediment because the mud had only been recently deposited then you would have to explain what sort of process would deposit half a metre of mud so quickly .\nAnd , how could such a thick deposit have been laid down at the edge of a lake ?\nThe authors opted to say that the unbioturbated laminae suggested the mud was situated in deeper water .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape because water would help to support their body weight .\nAnother problem is that the team found mudcracks on the mud , which they also interpreted as indicators of drought .\nMudcracks form when mud emerges from the water and has dried for a day or so .\nHow could the mudcracks form on the mud surface if it was in deeper water ?\nThis array of evidence that conflicted with their expectations puzzled the team and they once again presented the results as an \u201c exceptional \u201d discovery .\nHowever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and catastrophic entrapment of the animals are easily explained by the Flood catastrophe .\nAnd mud does not need to be exposed above water for mud cracks to form .\nShrinkage cracks will form in situ once the overlying sediments have been deposited and the water within the mud is expelled and the mud contracts.9 These dinosaur fossils were found in the Cretaceous sediments of Inner Mongolia that were interpreted as being deposited on the continent .\nMore specifically they were found in the Ulansuhai Formation of the Upper Cretaceous , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What were these herds of dinosaurs doing in a desert ?\nWhere did they get the food then needed ?\nHow was such a large herd trapped in mud so quickly in a desert ?\nAnd how were they buried so quickly in a desert , before the soft flesh had time to rot away and before the skeletons had disintegrated ?\nThe fact that sediment was able to accumulate to such a depth over the animals ( now at the base of a small hill ) indicates that the depth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide the necessary accommodation , not falling .\nSo , it was not a desert .\nUniformitarian geologists invoke a desert

Behe answers his critics by Michael J. Behe Discovery Institute Press , Seattle , WA , 2020 Author Michael J. Behe is a leading activist in the Intelligent Design ( ID ) movement .\nHe is Professor of Biological Science at LeHigh University .\nBehe is a biochemist , and much of this work is rather technical and biochemically oriented in his back-and-forth polemics with leading evolutionists .\nSince biochemistry is not my field , I do not elaborate on this subject in my review .\nRather , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addresses many evolutionary objections to ID .\nThe reader who has followed this issue for many decades , as I have , may be impressed by the fact that the same bogus arguments used against creationists are now being recycled and used against ID .\nBehe has a sense of humor .\nWhen an evolutionist objected that ID members extensively quoted evolutionists [ BTW , the same objection once used on creationists ] , Behe retorted , \u201c What is a book concerning evolution supposed to contain if not quotes from evolutionists ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 56 ) .\nIt was disillusionment with Darwinian evolution , and not religious teachings , that led Behe to embrace ID .\nHe writes : Nothing has changed .\nBehe still concludes that \u201c Random mutation/natural selection works great in folks \u2019 imaginations , but it \u2019 s a bust in the real world.\n\u201d ( p. 109 ) .\nThe mousetrap as an example of irreducible complexity : frivolous objections Author Behe points out that he chose the mousetrap as an example of intelligent design because the layperson can more easily grasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded protein .\nIt is plain to see that the mousetrap must have all its parts in place before it will work at all : There is no such thing as a half-mousetrap .\nSome evolutionists have argued that there are many ways to kill a mouse other than the mousetrap ( for example , glue-covered cardboard ) .\nThis is true , but is completely irrelevant to the existence of the mousetrap and its putative origins without an intelligent designer .\nIn addition , many different kinds of metal-and-wood mousetraps can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this does not vitiate irreducible complexity .\nIn fact , each type of trap has its own irreducible complexity .\nOther evolutionists , invoking exaptations , have noted that the mousetrap components , when acting alone , have various functions .\nFor instance , the spring is used in many different devices .\nThey posit that the different components got together and acquired new functions once they combined in the mousetrap .\nBut this does not eliminate the need for an intelligent designer ; it only changes its role a bit .\nAn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parts and harmonize their hitherto-disparate functions ; to get each component to work near-perfectly , and to do so simultaneously , with every other component in the mousetrap .\nOtherwise , there is no functioning mousetrap at all .\nAttempts to assemble the mousetrap step by step Some evolutionists have argued that a simpler mousetrap is possible .\nOne suggestion involved the use of a spring-alone \u2018 mousetrap \u2019 , wherein the spring ends are abutted against each other , in perpendicular fashion , and with just the right tension , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheese .\nBehe takes a closer look at this .\nTo begin with , the spring-alone \u2018 mousetrap \u2019 is itself an example of irreducible complexity .\nUnless the spring-ends are abutted against each other in a very precise way , and with just the right amount of tension between them , there is zero possibility of catching a mouse .\nIntermediate stages are useless and have no selective value .\nSo even a spring-alone \u2018 mousetrap \u2019 could not arise by small , successive , naturally selected changes as required by Darwinism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mousetrap \u2019 is incapable of being straightforwardly imported into the regular-mousetrap design .\nThe ends of the spring-alone \u2018 mousetrap \u2019 are deployed in a manner completely different from the way they are deployed relative to the trigger mechanism and the lever in the regular mousetrap .\nAgain , no series of small , successive Darwinian changes , each naturally selected , will transform a spring-alone \u2018 mousetrap \u2019 into a workable component of the regular mousetrap .\nThis owes to the fact that the intermediate states will not function as mousetraps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their survival .\nSo we are right back to an intelligent designer .\nThis time an intelligent designer is needed to bend the spring ends so that they jibe perfectly with the trigger mechanism and the lever in the regular mousetrap .\nClearly , then , the postulated spring-alone \u2018 mousetrap \u2019 is in no sense a simplified version of the regular mousetrap .\nNor is it in any way a potential stage in the hoped-for gradual Darwinian appearance of the regular mousetrap .\nOpponents of ID never tire of trying to dismiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requiring a prior belief in a deity .\nIt is not and does not .\nBehe writes : \u201c The conclusion of intelligent design flows naturally from the data itself , not from sacred books or sectarian beliefs \u201d ( p. 31 ) .\nIn my review , I use the word \u2018 Designer \u2019 with a capital \u2018 D \u2019 in deference to the Christian belief that God is the Designer .\nHowever , a designer or Designer can be inferred solely from reason and observation , just as a designer can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with religion .\nFor instance , Behe cites the example of SETI ( Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ) .\nWhen \u2018 listening \u2019 to radio waves coming from space , attempts are made to identify an intelligently designed radio signal from the background , unintelligent \u2018 noise \u2019 .\nNow some evolutionists have argued that we can accept a designer for the mousetrap because we see designers making them , but we can not accept a Designer for living things because we never see this process at work .\nThe SETI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly argument .\nWe can discern a designed radio signal even though we can not comprehend , let alone see , the extraterrestrial entity that made it .\nDesign or non-design are inferred in everyday situations .\nBehe writes : Again , this has nothing to do with any kind of prior commitment to religion .\nIronically , perhaps , it is evolutionists that introduce religion into the picture , as when they regularly make \u2018 poor design \u2019 arguments .\nBehe will have none of that .\nHe comments : Quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell \u2019 of creationism will attach itself to ID .\nSo they repeat the hoary argument that ID is just \u2018 religion in disguise \u2019 \u2014a \u2018 dressed up \u2019 version of creationism .\nIt may be good propaganda , but it is completely contrary to the facts .\nBehe spurns the label \u2018 creationist \u2019 ( p. 62 ) .\nIn fact , most of his views are indistinguishable from those of the standard evolutionist .\nHe believes in an old Earth and in the common ancestry of all living things ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would be just as surprised as anybody else at the discovery of a human skeleton in the Precambrian .\nSo he accepts the entire evolutionary-uniformitarian package , and believes in the reality of phylogenies .\nFor example , he concurs with the premise that tetrapods evolved from fish ( p. 417 ) .\nIn order to understand Behe \u2019 s position , one must not confuse the fact of design with the process of design .\nHe stresses that \u201c design focuses on the endpoint , not the process .\nArguments about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bare conclusion of design \u201d ( p. 474 ) .\nFor this reason , there is , at this stage of evidence , no room for any kind of supernatural , fiat creation in Behe \u2019 s thinking .\nHe rejects the claim , attributed to him , that the irreducibly complex system must have originated ex nihilo by Divine fiat ( pp .\n63 , 466 ) .\nFurthermore , he provisionally rejects any kind of miraculous origin for irreducibly complex systems ( p. 473 ) .\nRather , Behe thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution to account for irreducibly complex systems .\nThere is the argument ( also long used against creationism ) that ID relies on negative evidence : The perceived inability of Darwinism to account for a living feature thus becomes evidence of ID .\nBut , not mentioned by Behe , the same can be said of all other situations .\nThus , in SETI , the failure of random \u2018 noise \u2019 to account for certain extraterrestrial radio signals becomes evidence for a designed source of these radio signals .\nLikewise , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unexpectedly dead person becomes evidence for a purposeful death ( murder ) .\nAgain , this is everyday reasoning , and has nothing to do with religion .\nBehe realizes that conclusions of intelligent design , like all conclusions in science , are tentative .\nIt is possible that such things as the self-organization of matter will eventually prove capable of explaining design without a designer ( pp .\n139\u2013140 ) .\nHowever , science must be based on what is presently known , and not on what perhaps may eventually develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for irreducible complexity is intelligent design , and it should be embraced .\nID is not just \u2018 natural laws in action \u2019 Having seen that ID is not creationism , we must avoid the other extreme\u2014of wrongly supposing that ID considers the presumed creative powers of nature sufficient to account for all living things .\nIt does not .\nIn evolutionary thinking , Nature is sometimes endowed with creative powers .\nBehe points out that ID adds a layer of design to that provided by nature .\nHe writes : Some evolutionists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific community says it is\u2014since prominent scientific organizations have decreed that ID is not science , therefore it is not science .\nThis sociological view of science , and reasoning against ID , was adopted by the judges in the US court cases that involved ID .\nBehe points out that saying in advance what is and is not science only risks conflating the presumptions and prejudices of the current group of practitioners with the way that physical reality must be understood .\nScience should be an unrestricted search for the truth about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( p. 482 ) .\nIt should not start with preconceived notions .\nOthers have argued that scientists should stick to methodological naturalism and thereby exclude ID as science .\nThis , too , means that science is being ruled by preconceived notions .\nFinally , there are those who say that invoking a designer is variously an argument from ignorance , an act of \u2018 giving up \u2019 , and essentially a copout .\nThis , too , is a preconception\u2014that a naturalistic , non-intelligent cause is the correct one ( p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be scientific , it has to allow for it to be potentially proved wrong .\nID qualifies .\nBehe comments : Some evolutionists , such as Jerry Coyne , have argued that ID proponents \u2018 move the goalposts \u2019 .\nAccording to their argument , whenever such-and-such a complex system is shown not to need a designer , ID proponents just latch on to some other complex system and proclaim that it is the one that needs a designer .\nThis \u2018 moving the goalposts \u2019 argument is fallacious .\nFrom Behe \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is evident that proof of a non-designer for a complex system would apply to all systems of comparable complexity , and not just that particular one .\nThe party line , as enunciated , for example , by the ( US ) National Academy of Sciences , is that ID is not falsifiable , and therefore not a part of science ( p. 130 ) .\nHowever , evolutionists such as Russell Doolittle and Kenneth Miller have claimed that their arguments have falsified ID .\nSo , evolutionists try to have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not falsifiable , and then arguing that ID has been falsified ( pp .\n130\u2013131 ) .\nThey can not have it both ways !\n[ Note that exactly the same evolutionistic gambit was tried against scientific creationists decades ago . ]\nAccusations of non-falsifiability can be turned around , and validly attached to evolution , just as they were decades ago in creation\u2013evolution debates .\nBehe updates this consideration .\nHe comments : Do not confuse survival of the fittest with the arrival of the fittest In his response to evolutionists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speculation and just-so stories .\nHe remarks : Let us take this further .\nBehe quotes evolutionist Jerry Coyne , \u201c First , as both Dawkins and I point out , if random mutations can not build complexity , how can they possibly have been so effective in artificial selection of plants and animals ?\n\u201d ( p. 227 ) .\nClearly , Dawkins and Coyne are assuming what they need to demonstrate , as unmasked by Behe : The blood-clotting cascade : gene duplication alone does not explain it Ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Michigan , has been conducting the LTEE ( long-term evolution experiment ) .\nHe has , so far , cultured over 73,500 generations of E. coli bacteria , observing the changes that have occurred in this period of time .\nNormally , E. coli only metabolizes citrate in an anaerobic environment .\nOne day , Lenski discovered a new laboratory strain that did this in an aerobic environment .\nThe evolutionistic triumphalists hyped this as an evolutionary novelty .\nNot quite .\nHere is how Behe assesses this situation : Darwinian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutations Evolutionists glibly speak of neutral mutations becoming fixed in the population , and then a sequence of such mutations coming together with a successive mutation in order to make a substantial evolutionary change .\nIt may be that way in theory , but the facts are very different .\nConsider drug-resistant malaria .\nA certain mutation , K76T , considered to be neutral but now shown to be deleterious ( p. 361 ) , by itself confers not even a tiny bit of resistance to chloroquine , so we are not talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chloroquine resistance .\nInstead , a second mutation arises , and acts with K76T in order to make that malarial parasite resistant to chloroquine .\nSome evolutionists have objected that there are many ways for a malarial parasite to acquire chloroquine resistance .\nActually , there are potentially only a few .\nBehe remarks : Behe \u2019 s 1 in 1020 probability is based on the number of cells per malaria patient ( a trillion ) times the number of ill people over the years ( a billion ) , divided by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n( p. 332 ) ID will win out in the end Behe discusses the politics that has gone on in order to suppress and discredit ID .\nHe remains unfazed by all this , and has this forecast : Darwinian evolution continues to be an inadequate explanation for living things that exhibit irreducible complexity .\nTo the open-minded , intelligent design remains a viable explanation for this .", "author":

goes back to the early chapters of Genesis .\nGod created all things in six consecutive normal-length days , and all \u201c very good \u201d ( Genesis 1 ) .\nBut this perfection was spoiled when the

Rabbis after Jesus referred to the \u201c heels of the Messiah \u201d in this passage , and the early church called it the Protevangelion , the first mention of the Gospel in the Bible .\nThe Gospel

shortcomings .\nSince our shortcomings offend His infinite holiness , the punishment must also be infinite .\nEither we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never pay an infinite debt , or else a Substitute must endure it in our place ( Isaiah 53 ) .\nThis Substitute must fulfil two conditions : First : He must be fully human to substitute for humanity and a perfectly righteous man with no sin of his own .\nHebrews 2:14\u201317 tell us that Jesus died for mankind precisely because He \u201c shares their humanity \u201d .\nBut He didn \u2019 t share angelic nature , so sinning angels do not qualify for salvation .\nAnd the Substitute must have also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blameless sacrifice ( Hebrews 7:26\u201328 ) .\nFurthermore , the prophet Isaiah foretold this coming Saviour as literally the \u201c Kinsman-Redeemer \u201d .\nIt \u2019 s someone related by blood to those he redeems .\nIsaiah 59:20 includes the same Hebrew word \u05d2\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc ( g\u00f4\u0113l ) to describe Boaz \u2019 s relation Ruth .\nOnly because this Saviour is a physical descendant of the first man Adam via Mary ( Luke 3:23\u201338 ) is this possible .\nSecond : He must be fully Divine to endure God \u2019 s infinite wrath ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not withstand it .\nFurthermore , \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4/YHWH/Jehovah/God Himself said : \u201c I , even I , am the Lord , and apart from me there is no saviour.\n\u201d ( Isaiah 43:11 ) .\nSo calling Jesus \u201c Saviour \u201d is logically calling Him YHWH since YHWH is the only saviour .\nThe greatest Gospel preacher in history , the Apostle Paul , firmly grounded his message in Genesis in the great Gospel/Resurrection chapter of 1 Corinthians 15 : To explain the good news , as well as the reason for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we need

Jesus fulfilled Jeremiah 17:13 ( cf .\n14:8 ) by professing himself the fountainhead of living water ( John 7:38 , cf .\n4:10\u201311 ) , another potent symbol of life highlighted during Sukkot .\nWe

"Geckos are well known for their ability to stick to almost anything\u2014they can even walk upside down on polished glass .\nOnly in this millennium has the secret of the gecko \u2019 s stickiness been uncovered : its feet are covered with extremely fine hairs that exploit ultra-short range attractive forces between atoms.1,2 They avoid getting stuck because the hairs are curved , and store energy like a spring.3,4 Gecko feet are also self-cleaning,5 and have inspired a totally new type of self-cleaning adhesive tape.6,7 This design has been used to make an adhesive of carbon nanotubes that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat needed for soldering.8 Now scientists from universities in Queensland , Australia , including the husband-and-wife team of Drs Gregory and Jolanta Watson , have analyzed the box-patterned gecko , Lucasium steindachneri .\nThey discovered equally remarkable fine structure on gecko skin .\nBut instead of attracting , it repels .\nThe skin is covered with tiny dome-shaped scales about 250 microns ( \u00b5m ) in diameter in a hexagonal pattern ( 1 \u00b5m = 10\u20136 m ) .\nIn turn , these scales comprise microscopic spinules ( \u2018 hairs \u2019 ) only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nanometres ( nm , 10\u20139 m ) long , with less than a micron separating them .\nThese hairs have an extremely fine tip , with a radius of curvature of only 10\u201320 nm .\nIn between the scales , the skin is also covered with spinules.9 The nano-scale tips mean that dirt particles have only a tiny surface to stick to , so the skin stays clean .\nThe hairs also repel any water , making the skin hydrophobic ( from Greek meaning \u2018 water-fearing \u2019 ) .\nThe tiny domes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will roll into the valleys between the domes .\nGravity and wind makes these droplets roll more , and they clean off dirt in the process.10 These droplets coalesce together with startling effects .\nDroplets are held together with surface tension , or high energy per unit area .\nWhen two small droplets combine into a large one , the surface is sharply reduced , which means the total surface energy also drops sharply .\nBut ever since God finished creating after Day 6 ( Genesis 2:1 ) , energy can neither be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Thermodynamics ) .\nSo it must go somewhere\u2014and it goes into propelling the droplets off the surface , dubbed \u2018 geckovescence \u2019 .11 Thus the gecko skin is so water-repellent that it is called \u2018 super-hydrophobic \u2019 .\nThe skin also repels other liquids such as coffee , soy sauce , vinegar , red wine , milk , cola , and blood.12 Because geckos are so small , they have a high skin surface area compared to their mass .\nThis would be an open invitation to disease germs .\nBut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 bacteria , often the most dangerous .\nSome insight into the mechanism might come from the germ-killing cicada wing that has nano-pillars far smaller than germs .\nWork by a team including the Watsons shows that the germ is attracted to the surface , but the cell wall stretches into the gaps between the pillars until it bursts.13,14 However , human cells are safe on the skin .\nScientists are now trying to make materials that copy the gecko skin structure .\nThere would be many uses for a self-cleaning water-repelling fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially useful for hospitals .\nThe gecko skin is not only anti-bacterial , but is safe on human skin .\nAnd because it \u2019 s safe on human cells , it could be used for bio-compatible implants that would resist \u2018 superbug \u2019 infection,15 as well as a surface to grow human stem cells.16,17 Copying the designs of living creatures is called biomimetics or biomimicry , and is a rapidly expanding field.18 Dr Gregory Watson pointed out how useful this is : Of course , \u2018 nature \u2019 can \u2019 t figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .\nAnd since it takes high intelligence to make the copies , how much more would it take to invent the originals ?\nAs we often see in biomimetics papers , there is a fact-free homage to evolution .\nIn reality , it was a statement only about current function , which is better explained by design for this function .\nThere was not the slightest proposal for how this system evolved by random mutations and natural selection at each step , let alone evidence .\nWe have often pointed out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not at all the same as

years a number of specimens of the land-living dinosaur Scelidosaurus have been found along the Jurassic coast between Charmouth and Lyme Regis in the Black Ven cliffs of the Charmouth Mudstone Formation .\nThis is identified as the Lower Lias , or Early Jurassic , and dated according to the standard uniformitarian timescale to around 190 Ma .\nThe Jurassic coast is normally noted for its marine fossils , but the strata contain fossils of land-living plants and animals , such as wood and flies , mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nScelidosaurus was a quadrupedal herbivorous dinosaur with the front limbs somewhat shorter than the hind limbs .\nIt was an ornithischian dinosaur , meaning \u2018 bird-hipped \u2019 .\nIt is noteworthy that palaeontologists do not believe birds evolved from bird-hipped dinosaurs , but from theropod saurischian dinosaurs ; that is \u2018 lizard hipped \u2019 dinosaurs .\nProtective bony scutes , or osteoderms , have been found on the side and back in rows , which provided some armour for the animal when alive in similar fashion to the osteoderms on crocodiles ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saurischian ) .\nThe animal was typically about 3\u20134 m long ( figure 1 ) .\nJames Harrison found the first specimen in 1858 , which included a skull and a few bones ( figure 2 ) .\nIt was discovered as a result of quarrying activity at Black Ven , and was sent to Richard Owen who named it Scelidosaurus harrisonii in 1859 .\nThe more complete skeleton was recovered over subsequent months , with scattered osteoderms present , but seemingly missing the forelimbs .\nThese finds were carefully described in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a few bones in 1861 , followed by the description of the more complete specimen in 1863.1,2 Owen suggested the animal had lived on land , or on the margins of a river .\nFurthermore , he speculated that the carcass was then washed downstream into the ocean where the body experienced some limited decomposition and scavenging before burial in the mud.2 The remains have subsequently been subject to geological compression in the strata .\nThe find has been ascribed to the Woodstone Nodule Bed , part of Black Ven Marls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marine deposits ( between 199.3 \u00b1 2 Ma and 190.8 \u00b1 1.5 Ma ) .3 Other specimens have subsequently been found in the area around Lyme Regis and Charmouth ( and in northern Arizona ) .\nAnother find was described in 1959 from the same immediate locality near Charmouth ; found by James Jackson in the Stonebarrow Marl or Belemnite Marls ( early Pliensbachian ) , which is immediately above the finds described by Owen.4 Other specimens of Scelidosaurus have been found over the years , including with the remains of skin impressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least two specimens of Scelidosaurus are considered to have been found in these early Pliensbachian strata : dated to between 190.8 \u00b1 1.5 Ma and 182.7 \u00b1 1.5 Ma.3,5 What is of further relevance for creation scientists is that Scelidosaurus specimens have been found with stomach contents present and skin impressions left.7 Evidence of the preservation of soft tissues in the fossils further supports the necessity for rapid burial in the marine sediment , which is consistent with a global flood .\nIn the UK , a Channel 4 television program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 2004 , and carefully described the implications of these finds in terms of the requirement for rapid burial on account of the evidence.8 The program reported on the find of a 3.5m long Scelidosaurus fossil found within the Lower Jurassic rock layers near Lyme Regis in Dorset by a local fossil hunter David Sole in November 2000 , and commented on other recent finds.3 In the program the skin impressions of the 1985 find were likened to those of a crocodile on account of the pattern and osteoderms .\nThe remains found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of skin , but the specimen did show an almost complete skeleton with articulated bones , and even showing fossilized vegetable matter within its stomach .\nUsing X-ray scanners , they were able to show that the tail vertebrae were insufficient for the animal to have been a strong swimmer , which confirmed the belief that Scelidosaurus was a terrestrial dinosaur .\nThe program further discussed the presence of fossilized wood on the beach , which indicates the type of plants the animal may have consumed .\nThe main detective work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrestrial dinosaur might have become buried rapidly within marine sediment .\nSeveral ideas were put forward , but the hypothesis considered most feasible followed along the lines of Owen \u2019 s proposal .\nIt was proposed that a family of these dinosaurs had been washed out to sea in a giant monsoon flood , and then buried rapidly in the sediment to preserve some of the incredible detail found , such as stomach contents and skin imprints .\nBut inconsistently , natural scientists continue to date the layers in which the fossils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scientific researchers have made good progress in their detective work in recognizing that these terrestrial dinosaurs were caught in a flood\u2014their comment is that they must have been washed out to sea in a mega-monsoon , and then buried quickly in the thick marine sediment for good preservation to occur .\nThis is similar to Owen \u2019 s conclusion .\nHowever , paleontologists continue to date the specimen according to uniformitarian principles , which is effectively based upon the assumption of gradual deposition.9 There would seem to be flawed logic in this approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neo-catastrophism in order to account for the evidence , then uniformitarian assumptions utilized to date the layers in which they are found are no longer applicable .\nTo assert in one breath that fossil specimens must have been buried rapidly because of the evidence , and then to date the strata in which they are buried with the assumption of gradual deposition , is inconsistent .\nFurthermore , it stretches credulity to believe that specimens found in the same geographic locality can be ascribed to two different periods ( early Pliensbachian and late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be separated by thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years .\nThe evidence from the fossils is increasingly pointing to rapid burial through multiple layers , which should force a re-evaluation of the applied dating methods and techniques .\nA more logical conclusion that can be reached is that the Jurassic coast layers ( and we believe most other layers too ) were deposited within a relatively short period of time , and that such a major catastrophe is consistent with the historically recorded Noahic flood .", "author": "", "url": "https://creation.com/a/16185", "published": "Fri, 30 Dec

nuclear decay Prompted by the following question , Keaton Halley of CMI\u2013US offers some thoughts below about the Bible and various ideas in physics and cosmology , including the expansion of the universe and creationist proposals about episodes of sped-up nuclear decay .\nI have been interested in , and defending , creation for some time .\nRecently the Big Bang idea of \u201c inflation \u201d has become of interest to me .\nBasically , they claim the early universe , space , expanded exponentially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course to me this fits with God spreading out the heavens .\nIf it is theoretically possible at the supposed very beginning , why not any time God decides .\nNow I know God does not have to follow physics as He created it .\nBut He does tend to use the physical to fulfill His plan .\nSo , in my simple thinking , God spreading out the universe after He set the stars and such , makes sense .\nIt could explain the stretched light , as most think expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift .\nA recent thought I have had , is it possible that this rapid \u201c spreading out \u201d might have something to do with the apparent rapid nuclear decay in rocks ?\nI do not understand theoretical physics or nuclear physics , but it just seems like the two phenomena are related .\nAnyway , I am retired and spend a lot of time in Christian apologetics .\nThese supposed problems with creation , and the flood , interest me .\nI just wanted to bounce this off of someone who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a response , just to help my education .\nThanks , and keep up the good work .\nBlessing .\nI \u2019 ll try to answer your question in part by pointing you to other writings , since , like you , physics is not my field of expertise .\nBut we should distinguish between two types of expansion in the big bang model .\nIt sounds like you may possibly be conflating these ideas .\nFirst , there is the cosmological expansion of space that is suggested by general relativity .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redshift , as you say , including the pattern we observe that the further away a galaxy is from us , the more it is redshifted .\nSince there is good operational science behind the conclusion that space is expanding in this way , this expansion is not only a feature of the big bang model , but various creationist cosmological models as well .\nSome creationists do dispute it , however .\nSecond , the idea of inflation is a brief pulse of accelerated expansion which suddenly speeds up ( faster than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then dramatically slows down again , all within the first tiny fraction of a second in the big bang model , as you mentioned .\nThis \u2018 inflation \u2019 concept was proposed to save the original big bang theory from a number of difficulties , like the \u2018 horizon problem \u2019 .\nWe have written about this in several articles , such as Light-travel time : a problem for the big bang .\nBut a similar inflationary period could be a part of some creation models too , since it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( CMB ) \u2014the very reason inflation is invoked in big bang models .\nYou can read about this in an excerpt from Dr Jonathan Sarfati \u2019 s The Genesis Account : Divine expansion vs evolutionary inflation .\nThe full book is available from our webstore .\nNow , many creationists have previously or continue to associate biblical references to God \u2019 s stretching of the heavens ( e.g.\n, Isaiah 44:24 ) with one or both of these cosmological concepts .\nI certainly think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into creationist cosmologies if there are good observational or theoretical reasons to postulate them .\nBut I personally think it is unlikely that this is what the biblical language is describing .\nThe Bible was not written to disclose scientific mysteries about the universe that would only be discovered in the 20th or 21st century .\nScripture may include scientific insights since it gives us accurate truth about the natural world , but it does not seem likely that God intended to reveal secrets of post-Einsteinian theoretical physics there , because the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lived long ago , before modern telescopes and so forth .\nSeveral of the passages that speak of the heavens being stretched compare them to a tent ( Psalm 104:2 ; Isaiah 40:22 ) , so the likely analogy is that the heavens look to an observer to be spread out widely overhead ( from horizon to horizon ) , just as a tent curtain would be visibly stretched out over one \u2019 s head if one is inside the tent .\nThis is a phenomenological description of the heavens which doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don \u2019 t think these verses are suggesting either that the heavens are a solid substance erected above a flat earth like a tent curtain erected above the ground ( as some argue ) , or ( as others argue ) that space itself has been stretched in a modern cosmological sense\u2014growing like a piece of rubber being pulled in all directions .\nRather , the verses just mean the heavens were created to be a widespread spacious region , high above us and extending over all the earth , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might look extensive and spread out when stretched overhead .\nI also briefly discussed this subject in one of my lectures in The Genesis Academy series .\nSome creationist cosmologists have revised their earlier opinions and likewise argued against taking the \u2018 stretching of the heavens \u2019 language as a reference to an elastic type of cosmological stretching .\nSee Hartnett \u2019 s Does the Bible really describe the expansion of the universe ?\nand Humphreys \u2019 New view of gravity explains cosmic microwave background radiation .\nYet I think there is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least to read too much modern science into the biblical language .\nYou can judge for yourself , but I maintain that these poetic references were not intended to divulge insights into modern physics .\nRather , they use imagery that is equivocal about the structure and nature of the heavens .\nBut all this is preliminary to your main question , which was about how accelerated nuclear decay might relate to cosmological expansion .\nI don \u2019 t recall reading any creationist writings that claim accelerated decay could be caused by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s what you mean .\nIf you search on creation.com for articles about accelerated nuclear decay , there are just a few possible mechanisms discussed that are related to solar activity , chemical environment , changes to force strengths , and other circumstances .\nBut , the book Thousands \u2026 Not Billions ( p. 152 ) does mention a \u201c tentative , rather novel proposal \u201d by Russell Humphreys that cosmological expansion could be a mechanism God used to take care of the excess heat that would be generated by a pulse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this idea in chapter 7 of the RATE ( Radioisotopes and the Age of the Earth ) book ( volume 1 ) .\nKeep in mind also that the various creationist proposals related to cosmological expansion would be connected to different events in biblical history .\nAn inflationary period invoked to explain the smoothness of the CMB might relate to God \u2019 s initial creation of the heavens\u2014perhaps on days 1 or 2 of Creation Week .\nBut if a creationist model wishes to explain the redshift of starlight by this means , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Day 4 of Creation Week , when God made the stars .\nAnd if one wants to connect expansion to accelerated nuclear decay , whether to deal with the heat problem or for any other reason , the expansion would have to take place during Noah \u2019 s Flood , since that \u2019 s when the geological strata were being laid down and the rapid decay ( or at least some of it ) was allegedly taking place .\nSo , there is some food for thought as well as some additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of those rabbits .\nI hope that \u2019 s helped to clarify things .", "author": "", "url": "https://creation.com/a/16170", "published": "Sat, 31 Dec 2022 05:00:00 +1300", "published_utc": 1672480800, "collection_utc": 1672614603}]
